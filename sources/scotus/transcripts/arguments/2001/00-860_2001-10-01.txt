ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether an action for

12

damages under Bivens should be applied to a private

13

corporation acting under color of Federal law.

14

Like many cases, where you come out on a case

15

like this, I think in many ways depends on where you

16

begin, and the parties have put forward to this Court

17

fundamentally conflicting paradigms with respect to the

18

best way to analyze Bivens based on this Court's prior

19

decisions.

20

The respondent and the court below essentially

21

concluded that Bivens is a ubiquitous remedy that ought,

22

generally, to be available in order to maximize recoveries

23

and to maximize, or at least optimize, deterrent values,

24

and that it is our burden essentially to try to ascertain

25

whether there might be some conflicting or some exception

to the Bivens doctrine that would get us out from under

2

liability in the -- in this particular case.

3

QUESTION:

The --

Mr. Phillips, do you -- this -- this

4

involves only an action against the corporation not

5

against its employees.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

Would -- if the action were brought

8

as a Bivens action against the employees, do you concede

9

that there would be a Bivens action against them?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

We have always assumed, from the

11

first day of this litigation, that a Bivens action would

12

lie against the individual employees.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, there's a difference between

assuming it arguendo and conceding it.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, for purposes of this

16

litigation and for purposes of my client, there's no

17

question we would concede that an action would have

18

legitimately been -- been raised against them.

19

a future case whether or not a private employee might

20

raise an argument as to whether Bivens should be extended

21

is a separate question.

22

QUESTION:

To say in

Now, if that's -- if that's true and

23

that concession holds, if the employee is sued for a

24

wrongful act, under State law would it be permissible in

25

your view, just under standard principles of derivative

liability, to hold the corporation for that tort, for the

2

tort of its own employee?

3
4

MR. PHILLIPS:

You mean under a theory of

respondeat superior.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

As a matter of State law, it's

7

going to depend on the State.

8

recognize respondeat superior liability.

9

QUESTION:

Most States I think do

So, State courts -- State courts

10

could do that without interference with any Federal policy

11

or -- or without any superseding Federal law to the

12

contrary.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, obviously, there's going to

14

be at least the potential argument raised with respect to

15

Boyle and whether or not the -- the decision to hold the

16

individual liable under those circumstances is preempted

17

under Boyle.

18

weaker than it was in Boyle, and it probably depends to a

19

certain extent on -- on the -- on whether or not the

20

Federal Government in fact is dictating what both the --

21

what the employer and the employee are doing with respect

22

to --

23

But I think the argument here is slightly

QUESTION:

Well, if that's true, the employer, I

24

assume, would routinely be named in the suit.

25

not doing a whole lot by saying that the employer is

So, you're

1

independently liable for its own -- for its own

2

participation in the -- or alleged participation in the

3

tort.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you're doing an

5

extraordinary amount, Justice Kennedy.

And the

6

Government's brief, I think quite rightly, points out at

7

page 20 in footnote 10, that the availability of a

8

corporate defendant significantly changes the mix with

9

respect to any kind of litigation.

And actually, if you

10

look at the three cases that postdate this Court's

11

decision in FDIC v. Meyer, all of those are cases in which

12

the only defendant who was named happened to be the

13

corporation.

14

those circumstances.

15

The individuals were not named under any of

QUESTION:

But Mr. -- Mr. Phillips, if the -- if

16

the proper way of looking at this is the principal agency

17

relationship, when you're dealing with the Federal

18

Government, the Federal Government is the principal, the

19

agent is the officer.

20

contracts, the principal agency relationship exists with

21

the corporation.

22

that the agent -- the agent in this case is the

23

corporation -- why the agency liability doesn't carry

24

over.

25

Here, when the Government

(800) FOR DEPO

1

question, Justice Ginsburg, I think is where the -- where

2

the mistake lies in the final outcome of the decision.

3

This Court made quite clear in FDIC v. Meyer that it's not

4

a principal agency relationship because there's no

5

question that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

6

was the agent of the United States Government for purposes

7

of what it did in that particular context.

8

that's not the right analysis.

9

The Court said

The right analysis is to go back and look at the

10

Bivens action and make a judgment with respect to whether

11

or not the litigation, as it comes to this Court,

12

adequately serves the two primary purposes of Bivens; that

13

is, that there is relief available and that there is an

14

effective deterrent in place.

15

If those -- if those are satisfied, then the

16

issue of whether you should extend Bivens to a new

17

category of defendants, this Court said, should be

18

answered in the negative, saying that there is no reason

19

to add additional defendants under those circumstances.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, I wish somebody here

21

were arguing on behalf of the employee.

It's -- it's

22

certainly in your interest to say, well, of course,

23

there's liability on the part of the employee.

24

-- it's in the interest of -- of your opponent to -- to

25

say the same.

And it's

I'm not -- I can see us deciding this case

on, you know, well, after all, there's a suit against the

employee.

which somebody is -- is arguing that the employee is not

liable?

Shouldn't we face that in a -- in a case in

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

QUESTION:

No, Justice --

And there are arguments to that

7

effect.

I mean, after all, the -- the employee you say is

8

an agent of the United States, but if -- if he's acting

9

under color of Federal law as an agent of the United

10

States, he's only an agent of the United States because

he's -- he's an agent of -- of your client.

of an agent of an agent.

to hold -- to hold the employee and not to hold your

14

corporation.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

So, he's sort

It would seem very strange to me

Well, the question ultimately

16

comes down to this, Your Honor, is that does it make any

17

more sense in this context to resolve this issue at this

point in time than it did to decide the FDIC v. Meyer case

at that point in time.

resolve the conflict as to whether a private corporate

25

defendant ought to be liable under these circumstances.

Because, again, we didn't have the

And what the

1

So, that issue needs to be resolved.

2

And, what's more, if the Court puts off for

3

another day deciding the liability of the employee, it

4

doesn't affect whether my client ought to be held not

5

responsible in a Bivens action because either one of two

6

things will happen.

7

employees are, in fact, susceptible to an action under

8

Bivens, in which case the adequacy of the remedy and the

9

adequacy of the deterrent by having that direct lawsuit

Either you will conclude that private

means that there's no reason to extend Bivens to my

11

client.

12

between public and private actors and that we have special

13

reasons giving us hesitation and caution into extending

14

the Bivens action, since it's an implied cause of action

15

and not a congressionally adopted one, into the sphere

16

where the private actors are acting under color of Federal

17

right.

18

Or you'll conclude that the distinction is

QUESTION:

Strictly speaking, Mr. Phillips, for

19

you to say that you're making a concession that the

saying he concedes B would be liable.

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

They phrased it

I know they did.
I'm not giving up much in that

regard.
But as I say, the important element here, at

7

least in my judgment, about how all this plays out is that

8

if the Court decides that employees are amenable to suit,

9

there's no reason to sue the corporation.

If they decide

10

they are not amenable to suit, it's going to be because of

11

the public/private distinction.

12

theory, we're not amenable to suit.

And again, under that

That would be an argument, but in

order to do that, Justice Scalia, you would then have to

the first instance, which is that the litigation against

1

litigation against the private individual is the most

2

significant way to achieve the overall objectives --

3

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that we would have

4

to abandon that because the -- the concern, as I

5

understand it, that the action against the individual has

6

a more significant deterrent effect than the action

7

against the agency, was a concern that was expressed in

8

the context of dealing with a public agency.

9

Here we're dealing, in the case of your client,

10

with a private corporation.

11

deterrent effect of holding the private corporation liable

12

for the acts of its employee would be very significant.

13

assume that a private corporation like yours is going to

14

be very careful about employees who, in effect, saddle it

15

with significant liability.

16

it seems to me you -- you would lose the argument.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I would suppose that the

I

So, on the deterrence theory,

I think the flaw in your analysis

18

of the deterrence theory, Justice Souter, is that you're

19

looking to figure out what is sort of the optimal answer

20

for deterrence.

21

in FDIC v. Meyer is that what we satisfy ourselves about

22

is, is there an effective deterrent and an effective

23

damages remedy in place and available to the individual

24

plaintiff in a particular instance.

25

to me that's the gap-filler role that Bivens calls on the

Then you have to take into account the

And

10

that's a series of questions, I submit to Your Honors, you

11

ought to leave to Congress.

12

And that's exactly what the Court said in Meyer.

13

It analyzed and said, questions of optimal deterrence,

14

questions of effect on the Federal treasury, those are

15

issues that we think are better dealt with by Congress as

16

long as we have an adequate --

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you carry -- if the carry

18

the logic of that argument far enough, then there would be

19

no liability at all because we know that if we hold, for

20

example, the individual liable, there is going to be a

21

tendency there to shift that liability either by insurance

22

or by respondeat superior and insurance, ultimately to the

23

cost of contracting.

24

governmental situation, if you hold the individual liable,

25

chances are there is going to be some kind of liability

that ultimately is going to find its way into the wage

structure.

that, we better call the whole thing off and -- and

overrule Bivens.

So, if -- if we start getting too fussy about

Well -- obviously, we don't ask

the Court to overrule Bivens.

argument in the brief.

9

At least, we make that

But the -- I think the answer to that is there

10

are two components of Bivens.

11

the gap-filler adequate remedy?

12

and a deterrent effect from that damages remedy?

13

14

there will be a serious question as to whether or not,

15

nevertheless, special circumstances suggest that there

16

ought to be caution.

17

respondents burden to satisfy both elements of that.

18

One is, is there in place
Is there a damages remedy
Is that

Then sometimes, even though that's in place,

What I'm suggesting to you in this context is

you don't have to look at what the impact would be on the

20

think you can read Richardson as saying categorically that

To

With respect to the ability of the private

person to come in and argue the next time around, his

10

argument I think, frankly, is going to be a tough one

11

because what he's got to say is even though you have now

held the corporation not to be liable -- I'm assuming for

13

purposes of the moment that I win here -- that -- that we,

14

nevertheless, also ought not to be liable.

15

I said earlier, I think the distinction there is between

18

for the private employee under those circumstances to make

19

that particular argument.

And, again, as

And then your last point with respect to section

to subject the individuals, the private individuals, to

Keeton on Torts, William Prosser tells us that that

is to ensure that the costs of accidents are incorporated

In a context like this one, where you have one

QUESTION:

Was this complaint ever amended since

11

your client gained representation, or are we still

12

operating under the pro se complaint?

13

MR. PASTERNAK:

It was amended only for the

purposes of -- of attempting to name Mr. Urena as a

It's not an easy burden for someone to try and

13

identify who the specific person is that would have to be

sued, which is why the suing of the corporation is a more

15

manageable one from the plaintiff's point of view.

16

It would also be a more manageable one from the

17

defendant's point of view, we would submit, also because

18

it would allow the corporation to be the one who's

19

controlling the litigation.

20

It would be avoiding potential conflicts that

21

exist by naming the individual employees and having them

22

go out and retain their own counsel.

23

-- it would reduce the cost of the litigation for the

24

defendant because you're ultimately looking at the

attorneys as opposed to a multiple set of attorneys.

2

the cost to defend would go down as far as the

3

corporation.

4

So,

If we're also operating under a claim under

5

Federal law, then the rules of the game, as far as the

6

discovery, as far as the motion practice and general

7

procedure, would also be under the Federal law as opposed

8

to the State law, so that it would be easier for the

9

corporations to control their costs because they would

10
11

know how to be defending this type of an action.
And in fact, hopefully, these types of actions

12

would be decreasing as the liability would be there.

13

There are certain programs that would be going into place

14

by the companies to make certain that everybody has the

15

proper training in order to avoid these types of

16

constitutional violations.

17

Indeed, that's one of the reasons that we submit

that there would really be no danger to the public fisc.

10

the first thing that would happen, as far as a judgment

QUESTION:

Mr. Pasternak, compare for a moment,

7

if you will, the elements of damages you would be seeking

under the kind of claim you have in mind and the elements

9

of damages you might be seeking under a State -- State law

10

negligence action as -- as to amounts, amounts of money.

11

Are there elements that you could recover for under the

12

Federal claim that you couldn't recover for under a State

13

negligence claim?

14

MR. PASTERNAK:

As far as amounts, it's

15

difficult to quantify as to what it is.

16

Federal claim, we would have the claim of violation of the

17

Federal Constitution.

QUESTION:

As far as the

Yes, but what you want as a result of

the claimed violation is money damages, I take it.

MR. PASTERNAK:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And I'm -- I'm asking you would the

22

money damages be any different under -- under a theory of

23

negligence as opposed to the theory you're proposing.

24

Could some element of damages be permitted under one and

25

not under the other, or would they be the same?

MR. PASTERNAK:

I think it would depend on how a

jury viewed the elements --

QUESTION:

Well, but I -- I mean -- I realize

4

one jury can give you one result and one another.

5

let's suppose it's the same jury.

mean, the testimony as -- as to physical suffering and

7

that sort of thing, it would be pretty much the same,

8

wouldn't it?

MR. PASTERNAK:

10

QUESTION:

But

Or just -- just -- I

That would be.

Except you might have punitive

11

damages under State law, mightn't you, if -- if indeed it

12

was -- it was gross negligence or indeed virtually -- an

13

intentional harming of -- of the prisoner?

14

State laws, you'd be able to get punitive damages,

15

wouldn't you?

16

MR. PASTERNAK:

Under many

There would be a potential under

17

certain situations under State law to obtain punitive

18

damages.

19

QUESTION:

And you can't -- as far as I know, we

20

haven't held that punitive damages are available under

21

Bivens, have we?

MR. PASTERNAK:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

could a State just incorporate the Eighth Amendment

So, then you don't need the Bivens

cause of action even for the Eighth Amendment because

12

States are free to enact it if they choose.

13

MR. PASTERNAK:

But that would leave to each

14

individual State to ascertain and decide whether or not

15

there should be a remedy that exists as far as a Federal

16

constitutional violation, which is a separate and distinct

17

harm that needs to be addressed.

20

QUESTION:

Is the same thing true about other

Bivens actions?
MR. PASTERNAK:

This Court -- yes, it is.

And

21

this Court has routinely held that just the fact that

22

there is a common law claim that might exist is not

23

sufficient in order to find that there should not also be

24

Bivens liability.

MR. PASTERNAK:

Not as to a Federal officer,

correct.
In here, though, where we have a private

corporation, who is operating pursuant to its contract

with the Government, where it has a separate motive, a

8

fiduciary duty in order to maximize its profits, and there

9

the danger to the Federal fisc is less, we submit, or

10

certainly no greater than if there were an additional

11

Bivens situation, we would submit that the greatest

12

deterrence that could exist is to go and permit the suit

13

against the corporation and not impose the duty in order

14

to try and ascertain which employee would it be, whether

15

or not it's a former employee who set a policy who's no

longer there, but to permit it because it is the

corporation who has control of its individual employees

based on the relationship, whether it be for a limited

contract and what contract terms are or whether it be an

Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11
12

Thank you, Mr. Pasternak.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd like to address what I think are sort of two
pivotal points here.
One, derive -- I derive from Justice Kennedy's

13

question asking Mr. Pasternak about the effect of the

14

Richardson decision because it seems to me the Court,

15

obviously, should be concerned about what its prior

16

precedents tell us about the appropriate way to proceed.

17

He concedes, too, that Richardson, a case on which he

18

relied very heavily in his brief, frankly does not provide

19

him with much comfort.

20

I would have asked him, in -- in turn, the

21

extent to which he derives comfort from the FDIC v. Meyer

22

decision in which this Court, it seems to me, essentially

23

addressed the same issue we have here and told litigants

24

going forward look to the private employee, look to the

25

employees as the primary source to obtain remedies and to

1

obtain maximum deterrence.

2

then you're done with the inquiry because the Court

3

specifically addressed in Meyer the -- the question of do

4

you -- do you extend Bivens to a new category of

5

defendants.

6

And once you satisfy that,

And that takes me to the second point I think is

7

worth keeping in mind, and that was the question that

8

Justice Scalia asked, which is why don't we simply leave

9

this to Congress to resolve at the end of the day.

And it

10

seems to me a -- an intricate debate about questions of

11

indemnification, where we don't know what the final answer

12

is about who has what rights of indemnification, questions

13

of respondeat superior where we don't even know specifics

14

about what -- what causes of action may or may not be

15

available, questions of the availability of punitive

16

damages, all of these questions are left on the table

17

completely unknown at this point.

18

It seems to me, in the context of that kind of a

19

circumstance, the Court was correct in Meyer in saying

20

that we should leave these questions to Congress, and if

21

Congress acts, then you can seek out the kind of

22

parallelism between 1983 and a Federal cause of action, or

23

if you don't, presumably Congress will have explained to

24

you why there are disparities between the various

25

approaches.

It seems to me that the best solution for

this Court is to recognize that a hands-off approach is

2

the final answer.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, can I ask one quick

4

question?

5

the case and based on your question presented, that the

6

complaint states a cause of action?

7

9
10

Do you concede, for purpose of -- of review of

MR. PHILLIPS:

For purposes of where the case is

right at the moment, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think on remand, obviously we

11

would fight -- if -- if the case were to go forward, we

12

would continue to fight that issue.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, is it, -- is it correct

14

-- and some of the questions, including my own, have

15

assumed that you can't sue a Federal offer in State -- you

16

can't sue a Federal officer for a tort committed in the

17

course of his official duties.

18

You can't sue him in State -- or you can sue him in State

19

court, but it is removable to Federal court.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I'm not sure that's right.

It's immediately removable.

But there's -- there's no Federal

prohibition against the suit, is there?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there will be a preemption

24

issue that's going to immediately arise as to whether or

25

not he's immune -- whether he's immune.

And -- you know,

if it's within the scope of his responsibilities, then

he'll have -- he'll have an immunity --

QUESTION:
