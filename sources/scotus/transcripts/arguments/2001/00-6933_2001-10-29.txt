ORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Remon Lee is serving a life sentence without

11

possibility of parole for first degree murder without ever

12

having had a chance to present testimony from witnesses

13

who could have established his innocence.

14

I would like to begin by discussing whether

15

Lee's failure to comply with two Missouri rules governing

16

motions for continuance is an adequate State law ground to

17

bar consideration of Lee's Federal due process claim based

18

on the State trial court's denial of a brief continuance.

19

In the circumstances in which his motion for a continuance

20

was made, the answer is no.

21

Under this Court's existing precedents, Missouri

22

rules 24.09 and 24.10 are not adequate to bar review of

23

Lee's due process claim because application of the rules

24

in -- in this case was arbitrary and serves no legitimate

25

State interest where Lee lacked a reasonable opportunity
3

1

to comply with the letter of the rules under the

2

circumstances, where Lee supplied --

3

QUESTION:

4

now, I take it.

5

why --

You're -- you're just summarizing

You're going to go into more detail as to

6

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Yes.

-- the rules are arbitrary.
Correct.

I was just

9

summarizing for the Court the circumstances that made it

10

so that there was no legitimate State interest served in

11

this case.

12

QUESTION:

Well, at least as far as 24.10's

13

elements are concerned, presumably those could have been

14

addressed by counsel.

15

requirements could have been orally presented.

16

assume that 24.10 sets out certain information that is

17

generally regarded by the State as -- as crucial --

I mean, the -- the different

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

I would

That's --

-- in making the decision.
That's correct, and every

21

piece of information required by those rules were before

22

the trial court.

The Missouri --

QUESTION:

When you say before the trial court,

24

you mean in the presentation made at that time orally by

25

counsel?

Answer that yes or no, please.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

QUESTION:

6

No.

Every element --

Where -- where else are you saying it

came from?
MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

The opening statement by

defense counsel.
QUESTION:

So, the trial judge is supposed to

7

remember the opening statement by -- by defense counsel

8

when he passes on a motion for a continuance that's made

9

at the end of the trial?

10

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Let me clarify a few things.

11

Every element required by the rules was -- was before --

12

was stated by counsel or by the defendants on the stand --

13

QUESTION:

How about -- I didn't find anything

14

about that at all.

15

affiant knows of no other person whose evidence or

16

attendance he could have procured at trial by whom he

17

could prove the same facts.

20

The sixth requirement was that the

Was that addressed?

I -- I

Perhaps you could point me to where that

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

The discussion with the

21

trial court was -- bear in mind the discussion with the

22

trial court occurred in an emergency situation where

23

witnesses are suddenly gone and the -- and counsel is now

24

before the trial court explaining what had happened.

25

Everyone in the discussion knew who the witnesses were and
5

1

why they were crucial to his defense.

QUESTION:

This was a short

You -- you say that the trial judge

knew it too?

5

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Yes, and the trial court --

6

even in the colloquy, you can see that the trial court

7

knew who the witnesses were.

8
9

QUESTION:

At one --

And what their purpose was?

I -- I

didn't get that at all out of the transcript.

10

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

At one point during the

11

discussion -- the only question that the trial court had

12

for counsel was were these witnesses under subpoena, and

13

counsel answered that question yes, twice.

QUESTION:

his own.

court.

17

The counsel has to make a showing of

It's not just responding to questions from the

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

When the -- when counsel

18

pulled out the subpoenas and starting reading from the

19

subpoena and he read, Gladys Edwards is supposed to come

20

on the last day of trial at 9 o'clock, the trial court

21

responded, is she the mother, showing that the trial court

22

understood who the witnesses were.

23

was --

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Bear in mind this

But what -- what the purpose was.
There was only one issue in
6

1

the case and that was whether the defendant was correctly

2

identified by the eye witnesses or was he somewhere else.

3

This was the entire affirmative defense for Mr. Lee.

4

Three witnesses were his entire affirmative defense,

5

and --

6

QUESTION:

7

statement?

8

opening statement?

9

Was that explained in the opening

Could you elaborate on what was said in the

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Yes.

In the opening

10

statement, which occurred only the day before this

11

exchange took place, counsel outlined for the trial court

12

and the jury the fact that Minister James Edwards, Mr.

13

Lee's stepfather; Gladys Edwards, his mother; and Laura

14

Lee, his sister had traveled from California to testify

15

that during the period of July through October 1992, Mr.

16

Lee had been staying with them in California and was not

17

in Kansas City.

18

certain details that showed why they remembered when it

19

was, that he had come out for the birthday parties for

20

himself and for his niece and had stayed through the -- up

21

to the Halloween party.

22

the opening statement and made it clear that these

23

witnesses were crucial to his defense and is what his

24

entire defense was based on.

25

And they -- and his statement provided

QUESTION:

And all of this was laid out in

This -- this goes to the importance
7

1

of those witnesses.

2

didn't get a neighbor or, you know, somebody other than

3

his mother, his father or stepfather, and the sister to

4

come and testify he was out there.

5

there?

6

know, if I was looking for people to -- to bring to

7

testify for an alibi -- he was there for how long?

8

the whole holiday season?

9

I find it extraordinary that you

He -- he stayed in their home the whole time?

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

10

record is silent --

11

Nobody else saw him

He has to bring in his mother, his

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

I -- I can't answer that.

The record is silent on who saw him.

16

QUESTION:

Well, let me tell you -- let me tell

17

you, counsel, what -- what concerns me about your case.

18

Let's -- let's assume that you can convince us that given

19

the haste -- the press of trial and the shortness of time

20

that the counsel did about all he could -- all he could

21

do.

22

17 days or -- or 2 weeks later, and at that point, the --

23

the counsel made no specific showing as to why the

24

witnesses -- the mystery remained.

25

was no showing at all or even mentioned of the fact that a

But there was a post-conviction new trial motion some

8

There was -- A, there

1

court officer might have misled them, and -- and B, we

2

never know why they left.

3

weeks to -- to supplement that motion.

4

Whether -- the counsel had 2

I -- let me as you this as a predicate.

I

5

assume that the State trial judge at the new trial motion

6

had the opportunity and the right under State law to

7

revisit his ruling denying the continuance.

8

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

9

QUESTION:

Correct.

Well, there was nothing new shown by

10

counsel at that point.

11

that the press of trial and the surprise that attended the

12

disappearance of the witnesses excused the counsel from

13

doing anything more, he surely is not excused from this

14

skimpy showing 2 weeks later.

15

about the case.

16

So, even if you -- if we concede

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

That's what bothers me

Okay.

As for why, I was not

17

trial counsel below.

I don't know why he didn't say more

18

in the motion for a new trial.

19

the Missouri rules governing motions for a new trial say

20

that when a -- when error is assigned at the motion for a

21

new trial stage -- and this is rule 29.11 of the Missouri

22

Supreme Court rules -- that -- and a request is denied and

23

then that's made a basis for a motion for a new trial, a

24

short general statement reiterating that ground is

25

appropriate in a motion for a new trial.
9

But I can tell you that

1
2

As for why he didn't say more, I can't answer
that.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but you're -- you're saying

4

that Missouri, as a matter of due process, did not afford

5

adequate opportunity for this attorney to explain the

6

disappearance of his witnesses.

7

that the rush of -- that the press of time was such that

8

we can excuse the performance at the -- on the day of

9

trial --

10

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

11

QUESTION:

And even if I grant you

I have --

-- 2 weeks later he had -- he had all

12

the opportunity in the world to explain this, I think.

13

Now, Judge, we were in a hurry when you denied the

14

continuance.

15

what happened.

16

the end of the case from a due process standpoint.

17

Maybe you didn't understand him, and here's
He doesn't do that.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

It seems to me that's

I -- I disagree.

I think

18

that the ruling on the motion for a continuance is

19

evaluated ex ante.

20

motion was denied, and at the time that the motion was

21

denied -- and the standard has been stated in Unger v.

22

Sarafite.

23

It's evaluated at the time that the

Quote -QUESTION:

But Missouri gave to the attorney the

24

opportunity to revisit the entire matter at the post-

25

conviction motion for a new trial, and nothing further was
10

1

adduced.

2

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

The motion for a new trial

3

restated his grounds for granting a new trial, the fact

4

that the witnesses had come in -- and it did -- it did

5

explain that they -- these were the alibi witnesses from

6

California -- so that was clear in the motion for a new

7

trial -- and the fact that the trial court had denied that

8

motion without giving him a short recess or without

9

enforcing the subpoenas.

These witnesses were under

10

subpoenas, and rule 26.03 of the Missouri rules states

11

that when a witness doesn't -- isn't there for a criminal

12

trial, he's under subpoena, he's subject to arrest.

13

There's no special procedural rule that governs

14

how that has to happen.

15

whatsoever to enforce the subpoenas in this case, and

16

we're talking about just a short -- a few hours'

17

continuance to try to figure out what happened and to get

18

them in.

19

QUESTION:

The judge took no effort

These were sequestered witnesses, as

20

I remember it.

21

did the lawyer point out that the bailiff, or whoever it

22

was, had told them they would be excused for the -- till

23

the next day?

24
25

At the time of the motion for a new trial,

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

That was not stated in the

motion for a new trial.
11

1

QUESTION:

It wasn't until later.

2

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

It was in the rule 29.15

3

State post-conviction motion that that issue first came

4

up.

5

But the question of why the witnesses ultimately

6

left and whether the State was responsible for that is

7

really a separate issue.

8

go to cause, but it also goes to whether he has a separate

9

due process claim on that basis.

That goes to -- well, that may

It's not necessary to

10

figure out why the witnesses left to evaluate whether or

11

not the trial court's denial of a brief recess to try to

12

figure out what happened to the witnesses was an arbitrary

13

denial --

14

QUESTION:

Well, there's where I disagree with

15

you because 2 weeks later, he didn't show anything more

16

other than they were alibi witnesses.

17

assume, for purposes of this question that he knew that

18

because of the opening argument.

19

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

And I'll -- I'll

The reason why they left

20

doesn't change the fact that the moment that the trial

21

court ruled on the motion for a continuance, he didn't

22

know where they were, counsel didn't know where they were,

23

the prosecutor didn't know where they were.

24

moment, was it reasonable to deny him -- I mean, the

25

defendant only asked for 2 hours, just a few hours -12

At that

1

QUESTION:

Well, but what I'm saying is we don't

2

need to have at that time because we have the benefit of

3

hindsight 2 weeks later, and you had nothing new.

4

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

There's nothing new in the

5

motion for a new trial, but no new facts need to be

6

adduced in the motion for a new trial.

7

in Missouri to bring facts that are outside of the record

8

in a rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, and they were

9

brought up in the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion.

10

It is appropriate

There's no mystery here about why the State

trial court judge denied the motion, and he denied it on

12

the merits.

13

14

application, either the request for a continuance or the

15

form in which the request was made.

16

or the prosecutor signaled some question -- and again,

17

bear in mind the emergency way that this came up -- had

18

signaled some question, he could have cured it.

19

He did not deny it because the application
The prosecutor didn't object to the

Had the trial court

And in a way, you have a kind of a reverse

20

sandbagging where error is left embedded in the record and

21

it isn't until the direct appeal 2 years later that anyone

22

suggests there was something procedurally defective about

23

the motion.

24
25

QUESTION:

Do -- do we know that if he had been

given the couple of hours' continuance, which is what he
13

1

asked for, you would have located the witnesses?

2

did they go?

3

comes out from this stuff.

4

from the courthouse.

5

happened to them?

6

Where

I -- I'm -- that part of the story never
They -- they just disappear

Is there any explanation of what

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Well, the affidavits of the

7

witnesses don't state where they went when they left.

In

8

the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, it states that they

9

went to a relative's house.

The defendant represented to

10

the trial court at the time of the colloquy that he knew

11

they were still in town because there was a religious

12

event, and counsel provided the actual address of the

13

relative's house, at which were believed to be staying,

14

and told the trial court judge that they had no telephone

15

there, which is why the girlfriend had gone out looking

16

for them.

17

QUESTION:

Where did they go?

I mean, had they

18

gone to a movie?

I mean, if they were not back at the

19

uncle's house, it wouldn't have made any difference unless

20

it was a very short movie.

21

continuance that he asked for -- we have no reason to

22

believe it would have been -- it would have been enough,

23

and that's all he asked for.

24

disappeared into thin air.

25

went.

I mean, the couple of hours'

These witnesses just
We still don't know where they

14

1

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

2

QUESTION:

The --

Why do you say that, you know, if he

3

had only gotten these couple of hours, everything would

4

have been okay?

5

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

The record doesn't establish

6

for sure where it is that they went at the time they left

7

or for a fact that they could have been brought in.

8
9

Again, I -- I don't think that that's necessary
to the ruling because it's evaluated at the time of the

10

trial court's denial.

But if the Court disagrees, it

11

could remand this for an evidentiary hearing to engage in

12

more fact-finding about what the witnesses did.

13

The lower courts never got that far.

14

QUESTION:

I think -- I think that's your

15

burden.

16

that -- that harmed your client, and -- and if the refusal

17

to -- to give a couple of hours' continuance -- if there's

18

no reason to believe that -- that it caused any harm,

19

what's the difference?

20

I think you have to show that there was an error

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

There is nothing in the

21

record that contradicts the representations made by

22

counsel and the defendant to the State trial court that

23

they were staying at a relative's house and that they were

24

still in town, and the State has never offered --

25

QUESTION:

There's nothing in those facts that
15

1

suggests you could find them in 2 hours.

2

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Well, counsel's actual

3

request for a continuance was -- was until the following

4

morning.

5

have found them, the State has an obligation --

6

And if nothing else, even if counsel couldn't

QUESTION:

I'm quoting -- I'm quoting from your

7

brief.

8

hours' continuance to try to locate them.

9
10

Lee asked his counsel to request a couple of

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct, and then it's --

and then --

11

QUESTION:

Lee told the court that he knew the

12

witnesses were still in town, blah, blah, blah, blah,

13

blah.

14

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

But then -- but ultimately

15

counsel asked for an overnight continuance.

16

when the whole exchange with the judge takes place where

17

the judge says, oh, Friday I'm going to be with my

18

daughter in the hospital.

19

what about Monday, and the trial judge's response is, I

20

have another trial scheduled.

21

exchange takes place.

22
23

QUESTION:

And that's

Then the lawyer says, well,

So, that's where that whole

So, you -- counsel did ask for a

continuance until the following morning.

24

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct.

25

And the sheriff's office could have gone out.
16

Correct.

1

Counsel also asked for arrest warrants -- he called them

2

capiases -- arrest warrants to go out to find the

3

witnesses, if necessary, if he couldn't have located them.

4

And that's -- that's the least that the Due Process Clause

5

and the Compulsory Process Clause would require, would be

6

some effort to try -- to try to bring in the witnesses --

7

QUESTION:

But it's -- it's odd in a way, and

8

perhaps this doesn't -- that, you know, you would have to

9

get a capias and arrest your -- your father-in-law and

10

your mother and your sister.

11

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

You know, I think that is a

12

backup suggestion by counsel to cover all bases.

20

they were there.

The defendant has a right to have

He had no idea why they left or where they

And he was covering all of his bases by asking
It may

And just returning also to the circumstances in

22

which this exchange took place, the trial court had

23

created a real sense of rush and urgency in this trial.

24

I've quoted several instances in the opening brief.

25

footnote 9 where the State trial court had indicated to
17

It's

1

counsel that he wanted to move this case along.

2

before the lunch recess, in fact, he said, I want this

3

courtroom cleared by 2:00 p.m.

4

transcript page 570.

5

2:00 p.m.

6

QUESTION:

Just

And that's trial

I want this courtroom cleared by

Counsel, please -- please don't ask

7

us to write an opinion where we tell judges it's wrong to

8

tell counsel to hurry along.

9

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

10

(Laughter.)

11

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

No.

No.

And I'm not saying that

12

the -- the trial court doesn't have broad discretion in

13

how to manage its docket and everything else.

14

But when counsel was before the judge and is

15

explaining the situation that has occurred, the

16

atmospherics that had arisen where the trial court judge

17

is pressuring them to move along factor into how the

18

colloquy went, especially given that this is an unexpected

19

situation.

20

It's not that different from what happened in

21

Osborne v. Ohio, although I think that case is less

22

compelling than ours because there was no emergency

23

situation.

24

requiring that jury -- that objections to jury

25

instructions be made right before they're delivered.

But in Osborne v. Ohio, Ohio had a rule

18

1

Counsel didn't object to the lack of an instruction on

2

lewdness, but this Court said that the pretrial motion to

3

dismiss the indictment on First Amendment grounds was

4

sufficient and --

5

QUESTION:

Well, the rules for reviewing that

6

sort of thing in this Court have changed a good deal from

7

the time of Osborne against Ohio I think.

8
9

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Well, the basic principles

regarding when a State law ground is adequate haven't

10

changed much.

11

looking both to whether or not a litigant has a reasonable

12

opportunity to preserve his claim and also to whether

13

anything would be gained whether all of the purposes

14

served by the rules have been fulfilled, such that there's

15

some adequate State interest in enforcing a procedural

16

default.

17

This Court takes a functional approach to

The purpose of these rules is to permit the

18

trial court to pass on the merits of a motion for a

19

continuance.

20

merits, and we quarrel with the basis for the trial

21

court's denial.

22

can be.

23

court ultimately denied that request and it wasn't because

24

of any procedural defect in that motion.

25

The trial court denied this motion on the

We think it was as arbitrary as arbitrary

But there's no mystery here was to why the trial

QUESTION:

But the Missouri Court of Appeals
19

1

upheld the denial on the basis that it hadn't conformed to

2

rules what?

3

09 and 10?

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct.

And -- and there's

4

-- there's something anomalous about an appellate court

5

coming in to enforce a procedural rule, in circumstances

6

where there's an emergency situation, such that neither

7

the trial court, the prosecutor, or the defendant believed

8

that there was anything more that needed to be done.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I think it's fair to say

10

-- or maybe it isn't.

11

that what the appellate court was saying that at least

12

under 24.10, there was an insufficient showing, and that's

13

exactly what the trial judge found.

14

didn't cite 24.10.

15

because you're inadequate of showing under 24.10.

16

it's clearly implicit in his ruling.

17

Maybe you can argue with this --

The trial judge

He doesn't say I'm ruling against you

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

But

The only thing that could

18

possibly be missing in the showing that was made during

19

the exchange on the continuance was a failure to repeat

20

the full opening statement regarding what the witnesses

21

would have testified to.

22

QUESTION:

No.

I think it was assurance that

23

the witnesses would be provided within -- within the time

24

frame that -- that they asked for.

25

that -- that assurance was, and that's what -- what .10
20

I didn't see where

1

requires, and that's what I think the trial judge didn't

2

-- didn't have, and that's the reason he said, forget

3

about it.

4

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

7

One of the reasons.

QUESTION:

9

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

11

-- rule 24.10(b) requires

the name and address --

8

10

What rule 24 --

Where are you reading from?
I'm reading from page 3a of

the -- the appendix to the opening brief.
It requires the name and residence of such

12

witness, if known -- that was given -- and also facts

13

showing reasonable grounds for belief that the attendance

14

or testimony of such witness will be procured within a

15

reasonable time.

16

court during the discussion was both that they were still

17

in Kansas City, Missouri.

18

California, and that they had reason to believe they were

19

still there because they had a religious event to attend.

20

The showing that was made to the trial

They hadn't left for

If he had written out of amotion, he couldn't

21

possibly have said more.

22

under that ground.

That is a sufficient showing

23

QUESTION:

And they had come voluntarily.

24

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

25

QUESTION:

And --

They had not come by subpoena.
21

They

1

weren't subpoenaed until they got to Missouri.

2

there voluntarily?

3

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

That's correct.

They came

They were

4

subpoenaed in counsel's office when he was interviewing

5

them.

6

QUESTION:

They also skipped voluntarily just

7

before they were supposed to be put on the stand under

8

oath.

9

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

10

QUESTION:

But we don't --

Doesn't one factor that into account

11

as to whether these witnesses who suddenly vanish into

12

thin air are likely to be found?

13

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

No, because there was no

14

factual basis at that moment before the State trial court

15

judge to have any idea whether it was a medical emergency,

16

a misunderstanding, they had gone to lunch and hadn't come

17

back on time.

18

trial court at that moment to form any assumption about

19

why they left.

20

There was no information before the State

QUESTION:

They were there under subpoena.

They

21

knew that they were going to be testifying in an hour, and

22

they left without apparently telling the person who had

23

subpoenaed them, their -- their son's counsel, or anybody

24

else.

25

one to believe that it's going to be a cinch to find these

I mean, are those circumstances which would lead

22

1

people and bring them back within a reasonable time?

2

QUESTION:

But you also have to factor in the

3

fact they were sequestered witnesses not in contact with

4

any of these people you're discussing.

5

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct.

They were in a

6

separate witness room, and during the time that they

7

supposedly left, there were trial proceedings that were

8

going on.

9

at the point that they -- that the witnesses left.

10
11

There was -- they were in trial with witnesses
So,

there wouldn't have been contact.
QUESTION:

Did their sequestering prevent their

12

leaving a message with the -- with the clerk of the court

13

or a marshal or someone saying, tell my son we're going

14

because we had a medical emergency or, you know -- or

15

because, as the -- as the later story comes out, some

16

marshal told us to leave?

17
18
19

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Well, if you credit the

later story -QUESTION:

I find that so implausible that they

20

should just walk out, not leave any word for -- for their

21

son for whom they were about to testify.

22

think, if I were a trial judge, I would have thought these

23

witnesses are about to be found within -- within a

24

reasonable time.

25

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

I -- and I don't

You have witnesses who
23

1

apparently are unsophisticated.

2

They're not schooled in the law, and if you credit their

3

story that someone told them their testimony wasn't needed

4

that day and they could leave --

5

QUESTION:

They're not lawyers.

Wasn't there a thing too that he's a

6

minister, the father, and he was scheduled to give a

7

sermon that night?

8

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct.

He had -- he was a

9

minister and he had a religious event in Kansas City that

10

day and the next, which was the reason that was given for

11

believing that they were still in town.

12

effort to track these witnesses down or to enforce the

13

subpoena.

15

QUESTION:

No one made any

The defendant was in custody, was he

not, during --

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

QUESTION:

18

with him.

19

Correct?

So, they didn't have actual contact

They couldn't have gone in and said, hey, we're

20

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Correct, correct.

21

QUESTION:

There is a --

22

QUESTION:

But they could have told somebody to

23

tell him, couldn't they?

And -- and there was no reason

24

to believe at that time -- this story came up a lot later

25

after the -- much later than 2 weeks that -- that in fact
24

1

it had been some court personnel who told them that they

2

were no longer needed.

3

As far as the trial court knew --

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

It actually makes the trial

4

court's decision that much more arbitrary because at the

5

moment that the trial court is faced with this question,

6

you have witnesses who traveled voluntary from California,

7

who are under subpoena, who actually appeared in the

8

courthouse, were sitting in a witness room, and had

9

suddenly disappeared, and no one knew why.

10

QUESTION:

Why did it take 17 months to bring

11

out the -- the information that a court official told

12

these people their testimony wouldn't be needed?

13

not needed at all or not needed till tomorrow?

14

unclear.

15

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Was it
That's

Well, with respect to your

question regarding the delay, I think that's just a

function of how the Missouri post-conviction process

Counsel filed an amended petition, and so you

QUESTION:

Did he get in touch with these people

23

before -- before 2 weeks -- I mean, before the motion for

24

reconsideration of -- of the denial of -- of continuance

25

came up?
25

1
2

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

I don't know whether he got

in touch with them or not.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that's extraordinary.

I mean,

4

if they were so easy to find, one -- one would have

5

thought that he would have contacted them within the 2

6

weeks and they would have told him within those 2 weeks

7

that a court personnel had told us to leave.

8

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

9

QUESTION:

But he doesn't mention that --

10

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

13

that.

The record --

The record --

-- 2 weeks later.
The record is silent on

I -- I can't answer that.

14

QUESTION:

I know it is.

15

QUESTION:

Was the motion for a new trial filed

16

by the same lawyer who represented him during the trial?

17

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Yes, it was and in fact, he

18

was relieved during the sentencing hearing that took

19

place.

20

QUESTION:

I know.

He wanted to get out of

21

there because he wasn't going to get paid even for the

22

notice of appeal.

It seemed to me he was anxious.

23

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Correct.

And once he had gotten fee for what

had been done, he sort of lost interest in the case.
26

1
2
3

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

That is an impression that

the record gives.
QUESTION:

So, you -- you can't say that he --

4

he got in touch with these witnesses who would have been

5

so easy to find within a day.

6

got in touch with them 2 weeks.

You can't even say that he

I don't know.

I don't know.

to this Court's cases because I think I was beginning to

10

get into Osborne.

11

position here because the Court took a functional approach

12

in Osborne to whether or not there was any -- anything

13

that would be gained by forcing counsel to repeat

14

information that was already before the judge, and the

15

Court said, no, there was no -- there was no default.

16

I think that Osborne supports our

Other cases in which this Court has found that

17

procedural rules were applied with the phrase being

18

pointless severity or whether there were arid rituals of

19

meaningless form where technical niceties were not

20

observed, but nonetheless counsel could substantially

21

comply with the showings required by the rules, cases like

22

Douglas v. Alabama where you didn't repeat a futile

23

objection, cases like Staub v. City of Baxley where

24

counsel challenged on First Amendment grounds an entire

25

ordinance and didn't signal out particular -- particular
27

1

provisions to -- to attack because it was clear what the

2

-- what the lawyer was challenging.

3

NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers where the claims weren't

4

grouped exactly right in the -- in the State court appeal,

5

but this Court, nonetheless, found that no purpose would

6

be served by finding a default in those cases.

7

those suggest -- and -- and also the fact, of course, that

8

the defendant did not have a reasonable opportunity to

9

comply with the letter of the rules, but nonetheless

Wright v. Georgia and

All of

10

substantially complied with the rules.

11

suggest there should be no default, and in the

12

alternative, even if there was one, that there should be a

13

finding of cause and prejudice.

14

All of those

And with the Court's permission, if there are

15

any more questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of

my time.

QUESTION:

Very well, Ms. Vergeer.

18

Mr. Wilson, we'll hear from you.

19

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL C. WILSON

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22

MR. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

23

Justice Kennedy -- Kennedy, you are quite right

24

to be disturbed by counsel's failure to provide the court

25

any more information or better showing under -- under rule
28

1

24.10 in the motion for a new trial that was filed 2 weeks

2

after the events that the Court has been discussing than

3

he did.

4

But what should trouble this Court much, much

5

more than that is that 2 months following the last day of

6

petitioner's trial, his new trial motion was heard, and

7

the trial court asked counsel whether he had anything else

8

that he would like to submit in consideration of the

9

motion for a new trial, and counsel replied no.

10

QUESTION:

Why -- why do you think that might

11

have been?

12

was wondering why it wasn't ineffective assistance of

13

counsel not to put the thing in writing and not to comply

14

with 10.

15

I mean, why -- why do you think -- I mean, I

MR. WILSON:

First of all, for -- for counsel to

16

have represented the facts that 24.10 requires, counsel

17

would have had to believe that they were true.

18

the principal purposes --

19
20

QUESTION:

And one of

He didn't say all that in the opening

statement, did he?

21

MR. WILSON:

22

QUESTION:

Excuse me?

I'm --

I mean, I wonder why is there no

23

ineffective counsel claim.

Why didn't the Federal court

24

in this case say, well, look, you're the lawyer in the

25

State court at the trial, didn't comply with rules 9 and
29

1

10?

My goodness, that was in effective assistance.

2

didn't the habeas court say that here?

3
4

MR. WILSON:

The habeas court addressed the

question of whether there was such --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WILSON:

7

Why

Why didn't they say what I just said?
And because they -- they said that

claim was never raised to --

8

QUESTION:

Now -- now, that's exactly right.

9

Now I want to know why do you think that -- that

10

that claim wasn't raised at that hearing, namely, the

11

after-the-trial hearing, the post-conviction?

12

MR. WILSON:

First, how trial counsel conducts

13

trial motions and post-trial motions is an area in which

14

he -- there is a broad discretion for the trial counsel.

15

QUESTION:

Of course, and what I'm really

16

driving at is, isn't the reason that they didn't raise

17

rule 9 and rule 10 as showing ineffective assistance at

18

that post-trial business is because nobody dreamt that the

19

courts in that State of Missouri would apply rule 9 and

20

rule 10?

21

mentioned them.

22

appellate court, after this series of events, on its own

23

raises rule 9 and rule 10.

Because up to that point, nobody had even
They didn't get mentioned until the

24

MR. WILSON:

25

QUESTION:

Justice Breyer, that's correct.
That's not -30

1

MR. WILSON:

2

First, these are published rules of court that

3

were in the book long before petitioner's trial, and the

4

cases applying these rules, in fact, comparable to these

5

and in others, are -- it's an unbroken string of

6

precedent.

7

certainly deemed to be aware of those.

So, counsel was either aware of those or was

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WILSON:

10

That is not correct.

Well, at least --

QUESTION:

And second --- we know that the -- the trial

11

judge did not deny the continuance on the basis of a

12

failure to comply with those rules, did he?

13
14

MR. WILSON:

He didn't say because I find

that --

15

QUESTION:

There's nothing in the record to

16

indicate that the trial judge said, well, I can't grant

17

that.

18

this information.

19
20

You didn't file it in writing.

You didn't supply

That's not in the record, is it?

MR. WILSON:

No, Your Honor.

He did not cite

that.

21

QUESTION:

The trial judge denied it because he

22

wanted to go to the hospital with his daughter on one day

23

and he had another trial in another case starting the day

24

after.

25

MR. WILSON:

I don't believe that's correct.
31

1

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

2

MR. WILSON:

I don't believe that's correct,

3

Justice O'Connor.

4

the record indicates that that is why he denied the

5

motion.

6

I don't believe that a fair reading of

QUESTION:

What -- what does it indicate?

I

7

mean, I --I read it the same way Justice O'Connor did, and

8

I -- I don't -- what is your reason for --

9

MR. WILSON:

I -- I think the record clearly

10

shows that the reason he denied the continuance is

11

because, as Justice Scalia suggested, he determined, on

12

the circumstances that had been presented to him, that

13

these witnesses abandoned the defense.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Then why did he get into his

daughter's hospitalization and his Monday schedule?
MR. WILSON:

The -- the continuance that was

17

requested was till the following morning, and it was in

18

that context -- and -- and it is a single sentence

19

utterance there, that -- that he noted that he was not

20

going to be in the courthouse --

21

QUESTION:

Well, why if he -- if he was denying

22

the motion on the ground that there had not been the

23

specifications that rule 10 required, why get into his

24

daughter's medical condition?

25

MR. WILSON:

The trial judge could have been
32

1

responding to the idea that even though you've not made a

2

sufficient showing, I'm not going to cut a break for this

3

because --

4

QUESTION:

Yes, I assume -- I assume there are a

5

number of factors that go into the judge's decision.

6

is that -- the -- the court's own schedule.

7

the reason these people have gone.

8

your -- you folks -- I think he said you folks have been

9

abandoned by these witnesses.

The other is

He says it looks like

And so, he gives a number

10

of reasons, all of which are exactly what he has to do

11

under 24.10 even though he doesn't cite 24.10.

12

MR. WILSON:

One

He found that an insufficient

13

showing had been made, and there are other factors that he

14

would have been considering.

15
16

First, counsel had committed to this trial
schedule.

17
18

Second, defense counsel had announced himself
ready to proceed and had put on part of his case.

19

Third --

20

QUESTION:

The witnesses were there, we're told.

21

They -- they, in fact, were there and subpoenas had

22

issued.

23

unusual that in the strange circumstances of their

24

disappearance, that there wouldn't be some small amount of

25

time given to find out what had happened.

They were there.

And it is, I think, somewhat

33

1

MR. WILSON:

Except that the circumstances that

2

were presented to the trial court, Justice O'Connor, I

3

believe supported his conclusion that they had left --

4

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt?

Isn't it

5

correct that the witnesses were sequestered, and the one

6

person who would know where they were would be a court

7

employee who had -- in charge of the sequestered

8

witnesses?

9

MR. WILSON:

There was a court employee in

10

contact with them and also trial counsel was in contact

11

with them and the defendant.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WILSON:

No.

Trial counsel was in court.

But trial counsel went and checked

14

on them at 10 o'clock when the State rested its case.

15

was back one subsequent time I believe the record shows.

16

But at least he says in the new trial motion -- he says

17

with clarity and particularity that he went there at 11

18

o'clock and they were gone.

19

that they were gone, 2 hours elapsed before they were back

20

in front of the trial court.

21
22
23

He

So, from the time he knew

And it is important to note that the -- the

Well, they might have gone down to

MR. WILSON:

But if these are the witnesses that

11

beginning.

12

Our case is now

It will proceed -QUESTION:

Why would he have any reason to think

13

that witnesses who had come on their -- by their own

14

expense all the way from California and who were in the

15

courtroom that very morning -- they were there at 8:30, as

16

I understand, and at 10 o'clock they're still there.

17

would he have any reason to think they would leave?

18

MR. WILSON:

Why

Justice Ginsburg, he may not have

19

believed that they would leave or -- or suspected they

20

might leave, but these are the sorts of instructions that

21

trial counsel give their witnesses whether or not they

22

think that that might happen because the circumstances can

23

be very dire if they do leave.

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, if -- if we're -- if we're

going to make an argument based on what trial counsel
35

1

could be expected to do, why isn't it equally fair to make

2

an argument about what trial judges could be expected to

3

do?

4

And I would have supposed that if the trial

5

judge was denying that motion based on rule 9 or rule 10

6

grounds, he would have said I'm denying your motion

7

because you haven't conformed with rule 9 to put it in

8

writing, if that was the case, or rule 10, to specify what

9

you're supposed to specify.

And he didn't do that.

And I

10

am also supposing that if he had done anything like that,

11

counsel would have said, gosh, judge, please give me a

12

piece of paper and let me write this out.

13

So, why -- why isn't it a -- a fair inference,

14

when the judge says nothing about these rules, that the

15

judge in fact is not relying on those rules in any way?

16

MR. WILSON:

First, the judge did ask, following

17

the discussion about what had happened, whether counsel

18

intended to file a motion for a continuance.

19

clear in that that he expected or at least had reason to

20

believe that counsel would be providing a writing.

21

It seems

Second, this trial judge was a very well-

22

respected court of appeals judge in the State of Missouri,

23

and in fact he sat on the panel that decided State v.

24

25

determined that a showing -- where the 24.10 showing was
36

1

not made, either by affidavit, but also by substance, that

2

the motion -- that the denial of the motion could be

3

affirmed on that basis alone.

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Even -- even where it wasn't -- the

denial wasn't based on that basis.
Are any of the other Missouri cases involve a

7

situation where the trial judge did not rely on 9 or 10,

8

but nonetheless, his action was affirmed on the basis of

9

-- of failure to comply with 9 or 10?

10

MR. WILSON:

I don't know any of the dozens of

11

Missouri cases that are cited in the briefs that applied

12

the rule that a failure to comply with those rules will

13

foreclose appellate review where they cited that the

14

trial judge had made a specific finding 24.09 has been or

15

24.10 has been violated.

16

review that the appellate court undertook.

Instead, that's the -- the

Second --

18

QUESTION:

The question was --

19

QUESTION:

-- on that -- I -- I mean, they have

20

a lot of cases.

You know, and in their reply brief they

21

have -- the other side has some that seem pretty much on

22

point against you.

But there's no case that I can find

23

directly on point.

Direct.

24

MR. WILSON:

25

QUESTION:

Justice Breyer -So -- so, if that -- maybe you can

1

suggest one, but I'll go back and read it.

2

rule -- the standard I thought might be useful is the

3

standard in respect to that, that did the lawyer have fair

4

notice that the rule exists and applies in the

5

circumstances.

6

But the -- the

Now, maybe since -- and it was written in an

7

amicus brief that favors your side -- maybe you approve of

8

that standard.

9

And if you do approve of that standard, but I come to the

And I'd like to know, A, do you or not?

10

conclusion here that that trial judge did not have fair

11

notice that the Missouri rules would apply in these

12

circumstances where he was suddenly surprised by the loss

13

of witnesses and nobody in the courtroom said a word about

14

9 or 10.

15

appellate court went and applied it for the first time on

16

its own.

17

And nobody said anything about 9 ever, and the

That's a big question, but it has two parts, and

18

I'd like an answer.

19

it.

20

MR. WILSON:

The standard and the application of

The standard that you gave me,

21

Justice Breyer, I don't believe differs materially from

22

the standard in Ford v. Georgia which is firmly

23

established and regularly applied.

24

that regularly applied does not mean precisely applied to

25

these exact circumstances in a published case prior to the
38

It's important to note

1

defendant's trial, but rather regularly -- regularly

2

enforced.

3

And so, I believe that the standard you

4

articulate is a good one, and this rule meets it because,

5

A, it's published, and B, there were an -- an unbroken

6

string of precedents both before defendant's trial and

7

since that time, and not one of them excuses a default

8

under 24.09 or 24.10, reaches the merits of a request for

9

a continuance, and finds that the denial was error.

10

QUESTION:

The reason the -- the three aspects

11

of it that suggest maybe this lawyer did not have fair

12

notice that the rule would apply in the circumstances are,

13

first, the lawyer was surprised by his loss of witnesses.

14

So, he didn't have time to prepare anything in writing in

15

advance.

16

Second, he's in the courtroom talking to the

17

judge and he knows full well that everyone in that

18

courtroom knows every single thing about what rule 9 and

19

rule 10 require.

20

knew it.

21

it.

22

There was no missing fact.

The judge

The prosecuting attorney knew it, and he knew

And third, there is no Missouri case that says

23

that we're going to require a useless act in the

24

circumstance where the lawyer has suddenly been surprised

25

by his loss of witnesses and everything is going on orally
39

1

in front of the judge anyway.

2
3

Now, those are the three that I think cut
against you, and so I'd like your reply.

4

MR. WILSON:

Surprise, Justice Breyer, was not

5

present.

6

morning before the lunch break, substantially before the

7

lunch break, and discovered that they had left.

8

o'clock then until just after 1 o'clock is the amount of

9

time he had to conduct his investigation as to where they

10
11

He went to the witness room at 11 o'clock in the

From 11

had gone, but also to prepare a writing.
But leave aside the writing requirement, which

12

may or may not have operated with any purpose in this

13

situation -- I believe that it did.

14

he did not gather the information and present it all at

15

once to the judge that 24.10 requires.

16

Second --

17

QUESTION:

But more importantly,

Could you just tell me on that, what

18

could he have told the judge that he knew that he didn't

19

tell the judge?

20

MR. WILSON:

He did not tell the judge that

21

these witnesses could be located in a reasonable amount of

22

time and that they would give the testimony that it has

23

been suggested they would give.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, he -- the judge knew what

testimony they were going to give.
40

You don't question

1

that, do you, that there --

2
3

MR. WILSON:

I -- I do question that, Justice

Stevens.

4

QUESTION:

Didn't -- didn't the lawyer announce

5

it in his opening statement to the jury?

reason it was so -- so prejudicial that they didn't show

up?

MR. WILSON:

MR. WILSON:

MR. WILSON:

But the judge heard the statement.

The -- the -- a lawyer's statements

and opening statement are not evidence and they're not

11

13

Isn't that one

QUESTION:

Well, he did know that much, don't

you agree?
MR. WILSON:

I do, but -- but it requires

21

someone to attach their credibility to the proposition

22

that they will actually give that testimony.

23

QUESTION:

And, of course, I suppose the lawyer

24

knew what the family would testify to before they heard

25

the strengths of the prosecution's case, which was that
41

1

there were four witnesses that put him in -- in the city.

2

QUESTION:

I don't suppose a lot of judges

3

concentrate intently on opening statements the way they do

4

perhaps motions that they have to decide or something like

5

that.

6

opposing counsel objects to an opening statement, the

7

judge -- but certainly he doesn't pay attention to that

8

the way he would to lots of other things in the case.

9

If -- if some -- in the rare instance where

MR. WILSON:

Your Honor, that might be true as a

10

general proposition, but we don't need to rely on a

11

general proposition in this case because this judge told

12

these lawyers in this lawsuit the following.

13

don't have a lot of faith in what's said in opening

14

statements anyway.

Quote:

That's the trial --

QUESTION:

Are you going to tell me right now --

16

we both read this record.

17

that in your opinion, the judge did not know that these

18

witnesses were here to say that the defendant was in

19

California at the time?

20

MR. WILSON:

And are you going to tell me

The judge knew that he did not have

21

anybody in that courtroom who was willing to stand up and

22

say on my credibility, that's what these witnesses --

He did not know that he had the

Actually I asked the question that

I'd like an answer to.

The question that I asked you was

8

whether you're prepared to say right now that the judge

did not know that the purpose of these witnesses was to

testify that the defendant was in California at the time.

I didn't ask you the question that Justice Scalia asked.

I asked you my question.

That's a different -- well, if you're

could say is, standing there in front of the jury -- and

MR. WILSON:

But counsel's statements to the

jury in opening statement are not held to the level of a
representation of an officer of the court to the judge --

11

QUESTION:

But the judge was fully apprised that

12

the defendant was expecting to put on witnesses and that

13

they were alibi witnesses.

14

is there?

15
16
17

MR. WILSON:

There's no doubt about that,

The judge knew facts -- knew those

facts from the opening statement only.
But 24.10 requires someone to attach their

18

credibility to those propositions when they are asserted

19

as the basis for an interruption in the orderly conduct of

20

a criminal trial.

21

QUESTION:

Is it your experience that witnesses

22

ever have second thoughts about giving their story after

23

they've heard the strength of the prosecution's case?

24
25

MR. WILSON:
that does happen.

That -- Your Honor, I believe that

And I believe especially it can happen
45

1

in a case such as this one where the defense counsel did

2

not know the strength of the State's case as accurately as

3

he might have because instead of the --

QUESTION:

But were these witnesses in the

5

courtroom to hear that testimony?

sequestered.

MR. WILSON:

I thought they had been

They had been sequestered.

That's

correct.

9

QUESTION:

So how would they know?

How would

10

they know the strength of the government's case if they

11

hadn't been there to hear it?

12

MR. WILSON:

I don't know that they did know,

13

but I know that they visited frequently with the defendant

14

and with defendant's counsel.

15

know.

I don't know that they did

16

And -- and it isn't for us 9 years later --

17

QUESTION:

They did later file affidavits

18

substantiating what the -- was said in the opening

19

statement, didn't they?

20

MR. WILSON:

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me?
They did later file affidavits

22

consistent with what the counsel had said in his opening

23

statement.

24
25

MR. WILSON:

Yes, 4 years later they did, 4

years -46

QUESTION:

What about the third part which is --

2

I -- I take it as well that you would agree that the judge

3

heard that this -- the missing witness is a minister who's

4

there for a religious event that's taking place that

5

evening.

6

All right.
So, we know that 9 and 10 were not literally

7

complied with.

Now, but they might have been

8

substantially complied with.

9

everybody knows in the room what's going on, was the

And so, at this point, when

10

lawyer fairly apprised that what we had to do was perform

11

what he might have thought of as a useless act?

12

And the case that's the strongest for your yes

13

answer, he had to go through the form even though the

14

substance was right there in the case of the surprise

15

witnesses -- your strongest case or two under Missouri law

16

is?

17

MR. WILSON:

Missouri v. Cuckovich and other

18

cases cited in the -- in the dissent in the Eighth Circuit

19

where he quite candidly categorizes and admits that

20

Missouri rules of 24.09 and 24.10 applied prior to trial,

21

at the outset of trial, and during trial.

22

they apply --

23

QUESTION:

They apply --

Well, you don't want us to decide

24

this case on the fact that he didn't make an affidavit, do

25

you?

I mean, that's so easy.
47

The judge puts him under

1

oath or gives him 2 minutes to write something out.

2

You're not resting on that, are you?

3

MR. WILSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WILSON:

Your Honor, I am not --- 24.10 I would --I would think.
I'm not going to stand on the

6

formality, and we didn't stand in the court of appeals on

7

a formality of a writing or even the formality of an

8

affidavit.

9

But there was no one in the courtroom at the

10

time this issue was being decided who was willing to

11

attach their credibility to these assertions, who was

12

willing to say to the judge, if you stop this trial, I

13

believe there is a reasonable probability that I can

14

produce these witnesses and that they will give this

15

defendant an alibi, that they will say on the date and

16

time of this murder, he was not within 1,000 miles.

17

QUESTION:

So, if I read through the transcript

18

and I came to the conclusion that everyone in that

19

courtroom in that very short trial, in the circumstances

20

given what was said, would have very clear that this

21

lawyer does mean to tell the judge, one, these are my own

22

witnesses that make a difference.

23

witnesses.

Three, they're going to say he's in

24

California.

Four, I don't know why they left.

25

me a couple of hours or at least till tomorrow morning.
48

Two, they're alibi

Five, give

1

He's giving a sermon downtown and I'd like to try to find

2

him.

3

reasonable person in that courtroom would have thought

4

that was -- the lawyer was saying that in the

5

circumstances, I could hold against you.

6

If I think that the circumstances were such in the

7

courtroom that anyone would have -- any reasonable person

8

would have come to the conclusion that this was in effect

9

what the lawyer was telling the judge.

Now, if I come to the conclusion that any one

10

MR. WILSON:

Is that right?

In effect, what the lawyer was

11

telling the judge by reference, implied or otherwise, to

12

the entire body of trial is not what 24.09 or 24.10

13

require.

14

application for the continuance.

They require that that showing be made in the

15

Now, if we say that an oral application is fine,

16

okay, but you still have to present the facts and you have

17

to present them in a way that makes them believable

18

because what's being asked for is a serious imposition on

19

the trial court and its conduct of this criminal trial.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, at the time of the new

21

trial motion, the transcript was available to the judge of

22

the proceedings?

23

MR. WILSON:

I don't know, Justice Ginsburg.

24

The new trial motion was filed 2 weeks after trial, but

25

the new trial motion was heard 2 months after trial.
49

1

QUESTION:

My concern with your position is you

2

suggest twice in your brief that counsel ought to have

3

scribbled out this 24.09 notice.

4

legal pad and scribbled it out.

5

with your answer that you're not seeking to the form.

6

He could have had a
That seems inconsistent

Here is -- is a man on trial for a very serious

7

offense.

The lawyer is faced with the absence of the only

8

witnesses he has.

9

thinking about scribbling anything on a piece of paper?

He's got to do his best.

Should he be

10

Should he be -- have all of his attention trained on how

11

can he do the best for his client under these extremely

12

horrible circumstances?

13

MR. WILSON:

Justice Ginsburg, that argument in

14

the brief is -- is not made to show what a reasonable

15

lawyer would do or what every lawyer could do, but rather

16

to show that it was neither impossible nor impractical --

17

impracticable to comply with the rule.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I -- 29.09.

I was

19

surprised to see the Missouri Court of Appeals interpret

20

it to apply to things like a motion for a continuance

21

arising during trial because it -- well, it's very

22

difficult, I would think, for a lawyer, suddenly faced

23

with an emergency like this, to -- you know, you obviously

24

-- you can't go back to your office and dictate a motion,

25

and to simply write out something in longhand when perhaps
50

1
2

he can simply make the statement orally.
MR. WILSON:

It may be surprising that -- that

3

the court of appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court have

4

done that, but they have done it.

5

Missouri law and -- and it has been so for some time.

6

the mere fact --

7

QUESTION:

And that is the
And

We don't know -- we don't know that

8

-- that the idea of you have to scribble something in the

9

court has been around for some time because, as you said,

10

there's no case that presents precisely that situation

11

where the motion is in the -- in the heat trial something

12

unexpected happens.

13

so, under the Missouri rules you must sit there in your

14

seat at counsel table and scribble out a motion.

15

MR. WILSON:

You have no precedent that says, even

Well, the -- no.

The -- the

16

precise circumstances of this petitioner's case have not

17

arisen in a published case in Missouri.

18

That's correct.

But there is -- it was clear that in the midst

19

trial and even in some exigency, the courts of appeals and

20

the Missouri Supreme Court had held 24.09 and 24.10 to

21

require a writing and a sufficient showing in the past.

22

And -- so, if this counsel -- as soon as this colloquy was

23

concluded and the motion had been denied, they turned

24

immediately to the -- to the petitioner's counsel's motion

25

for judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the
51

1

evidence.

2

that in order to preserve his right to appeal any of the

3

points therein, he asked the judge, and the judge gave him

4

permission, to file the writing later.

5

He made that motion orally, but because he knew

The same is true with this rule.

Because

6

anybody who had read the cases applying 24.09 and 24.10

7

would know that you are forfeiting your right to appellate

8

review of a denial if you have not put the sufficient

9

showing before the judge and done so in writing.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, I thought you weren't

11

going to rely very much on the -- on the not written part,

12

but let's talk about the other part, that all of these --

13

even if all of these factors of substance that had to be

14

in the motion were somewhere in the trial transcript and

15

even if you could say that this trial judge knew it, you

16

couldn't say, could you, that the court of appeals knew

17

it, that the court of appeals could look back to this

18

motion without searching the entire transcript and asking

19

itself, I wonder what, under this transcript, the trial

20

judge knew?

21

not look at the motion and say, well, he set forth what he

22

had to say -- set forth.

The -- the court of appeals in Missouri could

23

MR. WILSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

That -- that's clear, isn't it?

Yes, that is clear.
The court of appeals would have been

constrained to review the entire trial record, which it is
52

1

one of the purposes of -- of .10 to avoid.

2

MR. WILSON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

24.10 -- one of the --

It is not purposeless, even if you

4

assume that the trial judge knew that -- that in fact the

5

lawyer was -- was making the affidavit that he -- that he

6

had to make.

7

MR. WILSON:

Yes.

The purpose would be to

8

provide a meaningful appellate review by bounding the

9

relevant facts in a credible fashion and presenting them

10

not just to the trial judge, but also to the court of

11

appeals.

12

QUESTION:

But, of course, I suppose the court

13

of appeals is entitled to rely upon the trial judge's

14

reasons when it reviews the adequacy of those reasons for

15

granting the motion.

16

not look -- do not reasonably refer to rule 10, then I

17

suppose on anybody's theory, the court of appeals wouldn't

18

have to search the record.

19

MR. WILSON:

So, if the trial judge's reasons do

Isn't that so?

No, I don't believe so because the

20

-- the very purpose of the appellate rule is that they

21

will not do exactly that.

22

complied with, then it doesn't really matter.

23

QUESTION:

No.

If 24.09 and 24.10 were not

All I'm -- all I'm saying is

24

that I thought what the -- the State court of appeals

25

would review would be the -- the reasons given by the
53

1

trial judge for ruling as he did.

2

MR. WILSON:

Isn't that correct?

No, I don't believe so.

I believe

3

-- I believe that what is appealed from is the decision

4

and not the reasons for the decision.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, in -- in answer to

6

Justice Scalia's question about hunting through the whole

7

record, wouldn't counsel, notified about the 24.10

8

requirement, say, judges, you don't have to read through

9

the whole record?

I'm putting it all in front of you, the

10

exact words.

It will maybe be two or three pages, but not

11

a whole record.

12

this very case, in a matter of a few pages say where --

13

where it was in the transcript?

14

MR. WILSON:

Shouldn't the attorney be able to, in

Except that compliance with 24.10

15

doesn't -- doesn't require you to be able to trace it

16

through the record, but rather that you presented it all

17

at once to the trial judge and that you did so with some

18

credible reason to believe that what was being asserted

19

was so.

20

Your Honors, 2 -- 2 months after this -- after

21

the denial of the continuance occurred, they appeared

22

before this very same trial judge to hear the motion for a

23

new trial.

24

better or further showing was provided.

25

fact like the -- like that they were available and able to

No explanation was given to that judge.

54

No

Even the simplest

1

testify the very next day in Kansas City was not offered

2

to this trial judge.

3

before this trial judge either at trial or on the motion

4

for new trial, and he had no facts to believe that he had

5

done anything other than what was fundamentally fair under

6

that circumstance on the circumstances as they had been

7

presented to him in the context of the motion for a

8

continuance.

There was no due process claim

9

Thank you.

10

QUESTION:

11

Ms. Vergeer, you have 3 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Wilson.

12

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MS. VERGEER:

Just a few quick points.

With

15

respect to the proffer and somebody being willing to put

16

their credibility on the line, the defendant actually took

17

the stand during the -- the colloquy on the continuance.

18

He was sworn, which actually you would think is a superior

19

form of proof to an affidavit, and there he was subject to

20

cross-examination by the prosecutor, if there had been any

21

questions.

22

the witnesses had been under subpoena, which they had

23

been.

24

like of inquiry about whether somebody is willing to sort

25

of swear to facts in support of the motion sort of falls

She didn't have any other than to clarify that

And -- and so, I -- I think that the -- that whole

55

1

by the wayside because he was on the stand.

2

In addition, in terms of what -- what all the

3

players in the sea knew about -- about these witnesses,

4

there's a rule.

5

that requires a notice of an alibi to be given.

6

Apparently one was given because the prosecutor came

7

prepared in her opening statement to address briefly the

8

fact that there was an alibi defense that she expected to

9

be presented.

10

It's rule 25.05 of the Missouri rules

And in addition, the detectives interviewed

11

these witnesses while they were in Kansas City and took

12

statements from them, and if there was any question later,

13

as the record developed further in Federal court, about

14

whether these witnesses really would have said what --

15

what they said they were going to say, the State had

16

whatever notes or statements that was taken from the

17

interviews that were done with these witnesses.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Robin-Vergeer, was any due

19

process argument ever raised at the motion for a new trial

20

level?

21

MS. VERGEER:

At the motion for a new trial, the

22

defendant argued the denial of the brief continuance and

23

the denial of the arrest warrant to enforce the subpoenas

24

-- argued that that denied the defendant a fair trial.

25

Due Process Clause was specifically mentioned in the post56

1

conviction motion and on appeal in the Missouri Court of

2

Appeals.

3

QUESTION:

Well, in the post-conviction

4

proceeding, as I recall, what was raised was ineffective

5

assistance of counsel primarily.

6

MS. VERGEER:

Actually, it -- it was both.

In

7

the amended post-conviction motion and -- and the relevant

8

passage is on page 56 of the joint appendix and it

9

continues through page 58 -- the defendant specifically

10

argued that movant was denied his rights to due process of

11

law and to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed

12

by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when -- and then it

13

sort of recites, and it -- and it goes along and says --

14

and talks about, A, the fact that someone told the

15

witnesses to leave and, B, that the trial court overruled

16

the -- the defense motion for a continuance.

17

the Due Process Clause is -- is explicitly stated there

18

and -- and thereafter.

19

If there are no further questions.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

21

So -- so,

Thank you, Ms.

Vergeer.

22

The case is submitted.

23

(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the

24

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
