CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

v. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.

6

Mr. Berger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are three important things that should be

11
12

kept in mind while we're addressing the issue this

13

morning.

14

totally prohibited a select group of individual landowners

15

scattered around Lake Tahoe from making any use whatever

16

of their land.

17

the kind of planning time-out touted by TRPA and its

18

amici.

19

First, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency

These prohibitions were never designed as

Rather, they were amendments -QUESTION:

Well, what about a temporary order

20

that says, gee, we're required by State law to develop a

21

plan and it's going to take us a few months and, pending

22

that, you can't develop?

23

immediately some per se taking rule?

24
25

MR. BERGER:

Now, does that invoke

It does if it's a flat prohibition

of use, Your Honor, and if there is --

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

A flat prohibition that says, while

2

we're developing this plan, which we think won't take

3

long, you can't go ahead with your development?

4

MR. BERGER:

Justice O'Connor, I do believe that

5

if it is a total prohibition on use, and there is no use

6

being made of the property at the time, that it's part of

7

the public project to have this freeze on use, and it's

8

the public that ought to be paying for that project, not

9

the individual landowners who are frozen out.

10

QUESTION:

Suppose that -- we'll have to play

11

with the facts a little bit, it's a hypothetical case, but

12

that within a month from now the World Trade Center is

13

ready to be constructed and New York says -- and the owner

14

wants to rebuild highrises for office only, and the city

15

says, wait a minute, this is so important to the whole

16

city, we need a year to think about it, a year in addition

17

to the usual zoning process.
MR. BERGER:

18

A taking?

I think if they forbid the entire

19

use of the property and don't allow any applications for

20

use to be made, don't allow the owner to do anything -QUESTION:

21
22
23

Well, they could use it for a parking

lot.
MR. BERGER:

If there is some reasonable,

24

economically viable, productive use that can be made of

25

the property at the time, then I don't believe we have a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

per se taking.

2

QUESTION:

Well, I guess my question -- and I

3

know you had a more general introduction before I

4

interrupted you, is the use of a moratorium a standard

5

instrument of zoning policy, or is it very rare?

6

couldn't find anything in the briefs on this.

7

MR. BERGER:

8

rare these days.

9

on.

I

It has, I believe, become much more

There's an awful lot more planning going

Agencies are doing a better job of planning, and they

10

find the need for this kind of a total prohibition on

11

development to be made.

12

QUESTION:

My impression is that most of these

13

moratoriums, or moratoria, whatever they're called, would

14

not be total.

15

rural zoning scheme that now doesn't have any limit on

16

number of residencies per acre, and you're thinking of,

17

say, no more than one house on every 3 acres, the only --

18

and that's what you're thinking about, the only moratorium

19

you would have to impose would be no more -- until we make

20

up our mind, no more than one house on every 3 acres.

21

wouldn't say, nobody does anything while we're sucking our

22

thumb on this question, right?

23

MR. BERGER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BERGER:

I mean, if you're considering altering a

It

That's correct, Justice Scalia -And --- and I think that's the more

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

typical kind of moratorium, and the kind that most of the

2

amici on the agency's side have been talking about.

3

QUESTION:

There was one Minnesota moratorium

4

that was -- seemed somewhat like this that had been

5

sustained by, I think the Minnesota appellate court.

6

MR. BERGER:

There was one, Your Honor, and I

7

would submit that that court erred.

8

courts do that sometimes.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. BERGER:

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. BERGER:

14

It happens.

Lower

And we believe that -So we notice.

And we believe that that simply is

not an appropriate precedent for this Court to follow.

15

QUESTION:

Why, why is it -- I guess this is

16

going to be your basic point.

17

take not this moratorium, but let's take a moratorium that

18

lasts for a year, and after that time everyone believes

19

the board will allow certain kinds of development.

20

things being equal, that year of no use would probably

21

have reduced the value of the land by 5, 10 percent.

22

so why, since that's the effect of the moratorium I'm

23

imagining, should the public have to give compensation for

24

that small diminution in value?

25

MR. BERGER:

Why is it the case -- let's

Other

Now,

Because it's not the diminution in

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

value we're talking about here, Your Honor.

2

total elimination of the ability to make use of the

3

property, and in all of this Court's cases you have talked

4

about denial of economically productive use of land, and

5

what we're doing here, and what you're talking about in

6

your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, is taking away the

7

right to use that land.

8
9

It's the

It's as if I took away your car for a year and I
parked it in the garage and I kept good care of it, and I

10

returned it to you at the end of the year with no

11

diminution in value whatsoever, or perhaps the 5 percent

12

that Your Honor hypothesized.

13

without the use of that car for a year, and I think that

14

you would be entitled to compensation for the fact that I

15

deprived you of the use of that car.

16

QUESTION:

You still would have been

Well, certainly if the respondent

17

here had simply said, we're going to need your property

18

for 3 years, and so we're going to take a leasehold

19

interest for 3 years, the respondent would have had to

20

compensate for that.

21

MR. BERGER:

Chief Justice, I couldn't agree

22

with that more, and I believe that that is in fact what

23

we're dealing with here.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, but you're -- it seems to me

you're not dealing with that here, because in that

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

hypothetical the person, the third party in fact takes the

2

property in the sense of using it for that party's own

3

benefit.

4

Authority isn't using the property for its benefit.

5

saying that during this period of time there are some

6

things that you can't do.

7

Here, no one, the Tahoe Regional Planning

MR. BERGER:

It's

That's true, Justice Souter, but

8

frankly I don't see the difference between them, because

9

the Government --

10

QUESTION:

Well, one difference is that the

11

person taking in the one hypothetical gets a considerable

12

personal value, i.e., the use of a car, or the use of

13

property for a period of time.

14

evidence here.

15

MR. BERGER:

There's no such fact in

Absolutely true, but this Court's

16

jurisprudence has always examined cases like this from the

17

impact on the property owner, not from what the Government

18

gains by the taking.

19

Boston Chamber of Commerce case a century ago.

20

QUESTION:

Justice Holmes said that in the

Isn't your argument, and wasn't your

21

answer to Justice Breyer's question in effect to invoke

22

the kind of standard language which has come out of the

23

Lucas case?

24

the property, or all economically productive use of the

25

property, and yet Lucas garaged that phrase in the

In other words, it is preventing all use of

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstance in which the denial of economic use was

2

assumed to be permanent.

3

Here, we're dealing with a situation -- Justice

4

Breyer's question dealt with a situation in which the

5

deprivation is assumed to be temporary, so that it does

6

make sense in his hypothetical to say, well, it reduces

7

the value of the property during the interim period maybe

8

by 10 percent.

9

from an indefinite, permanent deprivation which would

That is a very different economic fact

10

reduce the economic value of the property down to

11

something close to zero, and doesn't that distinction have

12

to be recognized, and isn't that the reason why the Lucas

13

formula simply cannot be used uncritically in this

14

circumstance?

15

MR. BERGER:

Justice Souter, I believe that that

16

distinction gets recognized at the valuation phase, not at

17

the liability phase.

18

period of time, or for less than the full life of the

19

property, would be compensated less than taking the full

20

fee interest.

21

QUESTION:

In other words, taking for a small

Yes, but what you're really saying

22

is, if the -- I think, that if in Justice Breyer's

23

hypothetical there is a diminution in the value for this

24

period of 10 percent, that you've got to compensate for

25

the full 10 percent, and it seems to me that our cases are

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pretty clear in saying, that's not how you measure the

2

compensation obligation.

3

of taking, you know, the one stick out of the bundle and

4

saying because you can't use that one, you've got to

5

compensate 100 percent for that one, but I think our cases

6

rule that out, don't they?

7

MR. BERGER:

That's the -- that's an example

Actually, your cases in quite a

8

number of different circumstances say that if you do take

9

one important stick out of the bundle, you may well have

10

taken the property --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BERGER:

Permanently.

Permanently.

Well, except in First English, Your

13

Honor, where this Court expressly said, and examined all

14

the cases, that temporary takings are constitutionally no

15

different than permanent takings.

16

QUESTION:

Well, except that that gets to the

17

argument that the other side makes throughout here, that

18

the assumption of that statement was that we had a taking

19

in the first place, whereas the issue in this case is

20

whether we do have a taking.

21

MR. BERGER:

Well, that's correct, and what

22

we're talking about here is a deprivation of all use.

23

That's why we have a pretty clean case for the Court to

24

deal with here.

25

QUESTION:

It's a deprivation of all use if you

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

fit it into Lucas.
Lucas was a case that did not involve a

3

permanent taking, so that it seems to me your first

4

argument has got to be not that the Lucas formula can

5

apply here, but that the Lucas formula should apply here

6

as opposed to this Penn Central formula.

7

that in order to get into First English.

8
9

MR. BERGER:

You've got to do

I agree with that completely, but I

think that what we're dealing with, if you examine the

10

facts of the case, is that from the time that these

11

ordinances were enacted in 1981 until whatever end point

12

you want to look at, there was a total deprivation of use.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Berger, you may well have

14

been able to prevail under the Penn Central approach, I

15

assume, viewed in its entirety over this period of time,

16

but that was waived.

17

MR. BERGER:

18

case, that's correct.

19

QUESTION:

Am I correct in that?
We did not present a Penn Central

And all you want is this pure and

20

simple per se taking, as applied to, as it comes to us,

21

what is it, a 3-year period?

22
23
24
25

MR. BERGER:

Well, there was this 3-year period

chopped out at the beginning of the time.
QUESTION:

And that's what we're focused on here

as the case actually comes to us?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. BERGER:

That appears to be what the Court

is interested in, as the Court reframed the question.

3

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question, Mr.

4

Berger?

5

looking at the liability stage as opposed to the valuation

6

stage, is there a distinction in your view between a

7

regulatory taking and a physical taking?

8
9

Just looking at temporary takings, and just

MR. BERGER:
Stevens.

I don't believe so, Justice

I think that this Court did deal with that in

10

the First English case, and it explained that physical

11

takings and regulatory takings are judged by the same

12

constitutional standards.
QUESTION:

13

So that in your view -- of course,

14

the physical taking, even for 10 minutes, would be a

15

taking.

16

even if the regulation prohibits all use of a piece of

17

property, an automobile, whatever it may be, for 10 or 15

18

minutes, there is a taking.

19

infinitesimal, but there's always -- past the liability

20

stage.
MR. BERGER:

21
22

There's no doubt about that.

But your view is,

The damages may be

If there is a total prohibition of

use --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BERGER:

25

QUESTION:

For 10 minutes.
-- there is liability.

Now --

So --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Berger, can you reconcile the

2

different approach that this Court has said goes for

3

spatial separation, like the air space in Penn Central,

4

and time segregation?

5

if Penn Central is the regime for splitting off the air

6

rights, it should also be the regime for splitting off a

7

discrete period of time.

8
9

MR. BERGER:

It seems to me that if the one --

Your Honor, this Court and other

courts have always dealt with the time value of property,

10

if I may, differently than they have in these spatial

11

terms.

12

have always been recognized as independent items of

13

property that are independently protected by the

14

Constitution.

The fact is, leasehold interests, future interests

If you had a piece of property that had a

15
16

landlord and a tenant and a lender and some remainder

17

person --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. BERGER:

20

But these are all physical takings.
-- with all interests, and it was

condemned, all of them would be entitled to compensation.

21

QUESTION:

But that's --

22

QUESTION:

These are all physical takings cases.

23

MR. BERGER:

And this Court has said in First

24

English that there is no difference constitutionally,

25

Justice Stevens, between the physical takings and the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regulatory takings.

2

QUESTION:

Suppose I --

3

QUESTION:

What do you do about the fact that

4

there is a regulatory taking of sorts whenever you have a

5

permit system, let's say the normal zoning regime in which

6

you cannot construct any building on your acreage without

7

first applying and getting the approval of the zoning

8

agency?

9
10

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Justice Scalia -During that period, there's been a

11

total taking.

12

until you get the building approved.

13

You cannot do anything with that property

MR. BERGER:

Clearly you cannot do anything

14

until you've gotten the property approved, but it seems to

15

me that there is a fundamental difference between a

16

landowner working through a system whose end product is,

17

at least theoretically and probably very likely, the

18

issuance of a permit to go ahead and develop something

19

that is economically productive on that land as opposed to

20

being stuck in a system where you're forbidden --

21

QUESTION:

But that would have been during that

22

interval of time it meets your test.

23

until the permit issues, so a fortiori, under your theory,

24

compensation due.

25

MR. BERGER:

Nothing can be done

I don't believe so, Justice

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

O'Connor, because --

2

QUESTION:

Well, that's what it sounds like.

3

Now, what about your basic zoning law?

4

going to, as a city, limit the use of this property to one

5

house per acre.

6

commercial property owner.

7

that, is there a taking immediately?

You can't have unlimited apartments or

8

MR. BERGER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Now, for the enactment of

No, Your Honor.
Well, you're permanently deprived of

the use of it for commercial purposes.
MR. BERGER:

11
12

I'm

Yes, Your Honor, but you are not

totally deprived of the use of it.
QUESTION:

13

But can we get back to the basic

14

question that Justice Scalia asked, and Justice O'Connor

15

asked it as well.

16

delay for purposes of ordinary zoning, which, let's

17

assume, prohibits you from any use of the property, is not

18

a taking?

19

I want your answer.

MR. BERGER:

Why is it that a

Because you are there in a process

20

working toward the actual development of the process, of

21

the property, pardon me, in contrast to being in a

22

situation like these people are, where there is no process

23

for development.

24
25

There is instead the desire --

QUESTION:

Let's assume that the Tahoe Regional

Planning Agency thought, in good faith, that there would

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be some development allowed, but they needed a year to

2

think about it.

3

Center hypothetical.

4

going to be built, but you say it's a taking, and I don't

5

understand the difference between that and the regular

6

zoning procedure.

7

My -- that's the same as the World Trade

MR. BERGER:

We know something very valuable is

The difference is that in the

8

second situation there is a conscious and total

9

prohibition on use, and that's the purpose of the

10

regulation, is to prohibit the use.

11

situation, where you're applying for a permit, the purpose

12

of the regulation is not to prohibit use but, in fact, to

13

enable use.

14

QUESTION:

In the former

Well then, it seems to me you have to

15

change your answer about the World Trade Center

16

hypothetical, where you say there's going to be a very

17

valuable use, we just don't know what it is, but we need a

18

year to think about it, in addition to the normal -- and

19

you told me that was taking, but now your rationale seems

20

to me to back away from that.

21

MR. BERGER:

If they are in a process where

22

there will be development at the end, then I believe that

23

there is not an automatic per se taking, but it seems to

24

me that what we're dealing with, if we've got a total use

25

prohibition, we do have a taking.

It's a question of

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time.

2

QUESTION:

But Mr. Berger, your -- it seems to

3

me your deciding whether the temporary taking is --

4

whether the temporary interference is a taking or not

5

depends on what's going to happen after the temporary

6

period expires, because in one situation you think, well,

7

they know they're going to get something valuable out of

8

it, in the other they don't, but that means that the test

9

for the temporary period turns entirely on an evaluation

10

of the future.
MR. BERGER:

11

Well, if I made it sound that way,

12

Justice Stevens, I apologize.

I -- what I'm saying is

13

that you have two different schemes set up.

14

process leading toward development.

15

process of total blockage, and where the intent of the

16

Government is simply to block the use of property.

17

not looking at the future --

18

QUESTION:

One is a

The other is a

We're

Well, you're not suggesting they're

19

doing it just for the sole purpose of blocking the use.

20

Don't they have some ultimate goal in sight here?
MR. BERGER:

MR. BERGER:

We have no question about their

9

the lake is to prohibit these people from making any use

QUESTION:

But it seems to me in effect -- maybe

this is a variant on Justice Stevens' question -- that

you're saying, what's really wrong here is that this is

not done in good faith, that this is not done, let's say,

15

in the case of the period of time necessary to get

16

permits, with an actual development in mind.

17

called a moratorium, but they mean something more than

18

just moratorium, they just mean stop, period, and it

19

sounds to me as though you're making it turn on whether

20

it's good faith or bad faith.

MR. BERGER:

This is

QUESTION:

And your argument in effect contrasts

4

that with an existing permit system whereby if you comply

5

with certain requirements you will ultimately end up with

6

a permit, the purpose of which is to make sure you do

7

comply with the requirements.

8

MR. BERGER:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly, Chief Justice.
But you still have -- I mean, in the

10

one case the regulating agency has said, you can't do

11

anything with your land while we're thinking about the

12

scheme we're going to adopt, and in the other case the

13

agency has said, just as categorically, you can't do

14

anything with your land while we consider your

15

application.

16

regulatory purpose they're both saying, you can't do

17

anything with your land.

18

In both cases they're, for a later

MR. BERGER:

Justice Scalia, in a sense that is

certainly true, but in the case of the processing of a

20

permit application, we know that there is permitted use.

It's there.

24
25

It's in the books.

QUESTION:

the application is pending.
MR. BERGER:

The regulations of the agency say

that for this property there is permitted use.

The

19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

question is how you make that use, and under what

2

conditions and circumstances, not whether there will be

3

use at all, where you have in the second situation a total

4

prohibition on use and we don't know what's going to

5

happen at the end of that total prohibition on use.

6

The key to it may be this case itself, where the

7

light at the end of the tunnel that they keep touting as

8

the saving grace of this kind of a regulatory regime

9

turned out to be no light at all.

There was a complete

10

continuation of the use prohibition when this temporary

11

so-called period ended.
QUESTION:

12

Well, under your theory it would seem

13

that -- suppose that a building catches fire and is

14

substantially destroyed by fire, and the fire department

15

comes, and the police department, and they block it off

16

for a period of time, no use while this is investigated,

Honor, that that would be a taking.

is a hazard, and at least the Government would have the

3

ability to order the property cleaned up before anything

4

else could be done with it, and I think in those

5

circumstances --

6

QUESTION:

You've got a wrecked building that

But that seems to make the question

7

whether there's a taking turn on the nature of the motive

8

of the -- underlying the regulation or the prohibition,

9

and I thought your position was, regardless of the good

10

faith and the great public interest in doing it, the State

11

has to pay when it does this.

12

MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, I think we all have to

13

live with what this Court called the nuisance exception

14

when it decided the Lucas case, and that there are some

15

things that the Government can do that prohibit all use

16

that are not compensatory.

17

QUESTION:

Are you satisfied with the standard

18

that says, every Government regulation is a candidate for

19

a taking, just as every speech act is a First Amendment

20

candidate, but it's actually a taking in this area only

21

when the impact of the Government regulation is not part

22

of a reasonable process looking towards a reasonable form

23

of regulated development?

25

MR. BERGER:

I think I could accept that,

Your Honor, if they had come up

with a nuanced, subtle regulation that had something to it

the properties involved in this petition are, today, still

totally deprived of any use whatever?

MR. BERGER:

I believe, Justice O'Connor, there

may be a handful of them that under the 1987 plan, and the

22

regulations that came under that in 1989, were finally

released and allowed to do something, but it's only a

small number, and for the most part these properties are

QUESTION:

Is it your position that the

2

application of the Penn Central approach would not result

3

in appropriate compensation determinations at the end of

the day?

5

MR. BERGER:

I don't know that, Your Honor.

As

6

a pragmatic matter, doing a Penn Central approach on a

7

case that involves hundreds and hundreds of individual

8

properties would have been a nightmarish litigation that

9

only the wealthiest of landowners would be able to afford

10

and, particularly in light of the clear prohibition of use

11

that they decided that they needed, we thought that it

12

made more sense to do a Lucas-type approach than a Penn

13

Central approach in this case.

14

QUESTION:

May I just ask this one question?

15

With regard to those who have subsequently been permitted

16

to develop their land, it's your view that you're

17

nevertheless entitled to a takings compensation for the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

Petitioners' only takings claim before the court

6

of appeals and his only -- their only takings claim before

7

this Court is a facial per se claim.

8

their contention is that the mere enactment of the

temporary moratorium in this case effected a taking with

11

facial aspect -- without any consideration of the reasons

2

10 years was necessary, if it was, the sorts of things

3

that are factored under Penn Central.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you could do a Penn Central --

5

you could have done Penn Central in Lucas.

6

Central is wonderful.

7

but as Mr. Berger pointed out, that's a terribly

8

complicated analysis, enormously expensive for property

9

owners to have to go through, which is why you have cases

10

We could apply it to everything,

like Lucas.
MR. ROBERTS:

11

This Court said Lucas applied only

12

in the rare circumstance, a total ban on economic

13

reproductive use.
QUESTION:

14

Suppose I take a 3-year leasehold,

The Government comes in and says, we're taking

11

regulation is temporary, the land retains economic value.

12

QUESTION:

Because the

I'm still not sure of your answer.

13

Your answer is that in my hypothetical about the 1-year

14

lease that's taken from the lessee, it has to be a Penn

15

Central analysis because?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Because you're starting out with a

17

property -- presumably the regulation applies to the

18

property generally, and it just so happens that this one

19

parcel has been severed out into a leasehold, and in doing

20

that, that is a question that has to be addressed before

21

you get to the analysis, should you sever out the affected

22

property interest to a leasehold.

23

QUESTION:

But you could have made that same

24

argument in General Motors, and I think the Government

25

did, that you shouldn't just treat it as a leasehold,

you've got to value the whole property.

no, there was a leasehold in effect, that's what the

3

Government took, that's what the Government has to pay

4

for.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

The court says

But if -- if this Court is -- in

6

its past takings cases, when it's been presented with a

7

regulation that applies to a discrete property interest,

8

it hasn't said, well, let's redefine the effective

9

property interests to that.

It didn't do it in Penn

Central, it didn't do it in Keystone Bituminous, and it

didn't do it in the construction laborers case.

hypothetical -- I know it didn't happen, but in my

No, I'm not sure it's no recovery,

20

but I am sure that it's still evaluated under Penn

21

Central, because --

lessor and the lessee.

23

petitioners are arguing for is an extension of the Lucas

24

rule which applied in a, as the Court said, the rare

25

circumstance in which all economic use is prohibited, and

No.

This is not a per se analysis.

QUESTION:

Why?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

The other factors include the

7

impact on the property.

8

was the effect on your property?

9

QUESTION:

You're claiming a taking.

What

Well, what if -- let's take a

10

hypothesis where the moratorium is 10 years.

11

still go through this thing that you're talking about?

12

cannot be long enough ever to be a per se taking?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Now, you
It

Well, even the court of appeals

14

recognized that the moratorium is long enough so that the

15

present value of the uses that might be allowed is de

16

minimis, then perhaps the categorical rule would apply,

17

and 10 years seems like it's going to be too long for the

18

Government to figure out and carry out its

19

responsibilities and planning, but I wouldn't say that we

20

try to find a point in time at which suddenly we shift

21

from the accepted Penn Central analysis to the Lucas per

22

se analysis.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but yet you agree that shift

has to take place somewhere along the continuum of time.
MR. ROBERTS:

I guess what I'm saying is at some

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

point calling something a temporary moratorium is a misuse

2

of the label.

If it's 30 years, that's too long.

3

Now, the best that Justice Holmes could do was

4

say that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I

5

may not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central

6

factors allow consideration of things like, what is the

7

need for it?

8

to justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be

9

sufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium.

10

The need may not be sufficiently compelling

What was the impact on your -- the property?
Keep in mind, the petitioners submitted no

11
12

evidence of impact on value.

We have no idea from the

13

record what the impact of the temporary moratorium was,

14

other than the evidence that we submitted which shows that

15

properties were sold for significant amounts of value

16

during the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes

17

sense.
A temporary ban on development doesn't render

18
19

property valueless.

If you have two parcels of property,

20

one subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other

21

subject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the

22

amici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and

23

the temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not

24

going to pay the same price for both of those parcels of

25

property.

The one that's subject to the temporary ban is

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

going to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact

2

that future uses are available, or will be available or

3

not, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted.

4

QUESTION:

I suppose that depends on how much

5

any prospective buyer would believe that the temporary ban

6

is really temporary, or how much they believe that it's

7

going to be strung out and extended, and if worst comes to

8

worse, and the Government can't pick it up at bargain

9

prices it will pay compensation to get rid of the land.

10

I -MR. ROBERTS:

11

And that's like the petitioners'

12

effort to link their lost challenges to the permanent land

13

use plan to their challenge to the temporary moratorium.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Mr. -The district court --

Excuse me.

Had you finished your

answer?
MR. ROBERTS:

I was just going to say that the

19

district court in this case specifically found that the

20

agency acted in good faith throughout, so the idea that

21

the temporary moratorium to allow planning to take place

22

was some kind of a sham for a permanent --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but it also found there was a

total deprivation of use for X amount of time.
MR. ROBERTS:

Only looked at from that period.

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Only looked at for the 32-month period, and our submission

2

is that that's the improper way to carve up the property

3

interest and say, oh, it's a total taking, because we're

4

going to only look at the property that was taken.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, in answer to one of

6

Justice O'Connor's questions about a hypothetical fire

7

damage case Mr. Berger referred to the nuisance exception

8

as possibly taking the case out of the whole takings area.

9

At what point in what procedure would the possible

10

availability of the nuisance defense arise or be

11

considered with respect to polluting Lake Tahoe?
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, we raised the claim before

13

the court of appeals that one reason there was no taking,

14

even if Lucas applied, was because of the nuisance, et

15

cetera.

16

issue.

The Court didn't find it necessary to reach that

17

QUESTION:

I see.

18

QUESTION:

And so the district court said there

19

wasn't -- that a nuisance hadn't been made out.

20

district court said that, didn't it?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

The

That's right, and we appealed

that, and the court of appeals didn't find -QUESTION:

And what was your argument to the

court of appeals, that this was a nuisance exception?
MR. ROBERTS:

That given the impact on the lake

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of development, that it fell within the California and

2

Nevada nuisance requirements.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

That it all should be a park.
Not that it should all be a park,

5

but that further development would threaten the serious

6

and, in fact, irreparable harm to the lake.

7

basis for the Government action in this case that the

8

petitioners have never challenged.

9

That's the

But I want to emphasize in concluding that it's

10

important to remember that the issue is not whether a

11

total ban on use for this period effects a taking.

12

issue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81

13

to April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the

14

responsibility of undertaking planning with respect to

15

these lots is on its face with respect to every lot that

16

it applied to a per se taking without regard to the

17

reason.

18

QUESTION:

The

Phrased that way, it's quite clearly

19

in your favor, but I think they're seeing this as a group

20

of landowners thinking from the beginning, whatever the

21

justification for this, and the justification is

22

excellent, saving Lake Tahoe, it's going to end up that we

23

won't be able to use our land for anything, and we've been

24

able to tell you that from day one, so we brought a case

25

right off the bat that we knew that was going to happen,

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and then year after year went by when people told us,

2

maybe you'll be able to build, maybe you won't, which

3

really wasn't so, we knew we wouldn't, and then it ended

4

up that we couldn't, all right.

5

Now, what are we supposed to say to them?

6

Aren't they supposed to have some remedy at law?

7

that's I think why he wanted to hear all his questions,

8

not just one, and there is that lurking in this case, and

9

I'm not totally sure how to deal with it.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

And

Well, first of all they waited

11

until the '84 plan took effect to file their lawsuit.

12

That suggests to me the gripe was with the permanent ban,

13

not so much the temporary moratorium.

14

Second of all, the supposition in your question

15

makes this not a facial challenge.

16

not the mere enactment.

17

really going on here.

18

that's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your

19

case said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied

20

challenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking.

21

QUESTION:

In other words, it's

It's because we know what's
That's an as-applied challenge,

So do you agree that a temporary

22

moratorium that ripens into a permanent ban is a taking?

23

I mean, you know, let's assume that I sold the

24

property during the temporary moratorium which later

25

ripens into a total ban, and I claim that I should have

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been compensated for those 3 years that I owned the

2

property without any ability to do -- does that constitute

3

a taking?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

I think the period in which the

5

agency's justification is, we need a time-out to undertake

6

planning so that we're not locking the barn door after the

7

horse escapes, should be evaluated separately from the

8

period in which the agency says, this is the land use

9

plan, and if you've got a gripe with us you can challenge

10

that.

11

the Government action is different in those two periods.

12

Those are two separate periods.

QUESTION:

The character of

Okay, let's assume that they are

13

analyzed separately, and it is found that for the period

14

Justice Scalia is talking about the Government really was

15

not acting in good faith.

16

that moment on, from the first day on, was to ban all

17

development whatsoever.

18

claim for a complete taking during the 3-year period?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROBERTS:

Its plan, its intent right from

In that case, does he have a

Oh, certainly, yes.

Okay.
Yes.

I don't think it's a facial

22

claim, because it depends on more than looking

23

specifically at the face of the ordinance.

24

QUESTION:

25

faith and intent --

So it's a question basically of good

MR. ROBERTS:

And here the --

-- and understanding what they're

doing.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

The district court at petition

5

appendix at page 69 said the agency acted in complete good

6

faith, and completed its responsibilities as quickly as

7

could be expected.

8

Thank you, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

If the court of appeals opinion is

10

just simply affirmed just as is, weren't we wasting our

11

time in First English?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, no.

First English didn't

13

address the question of when a temporary regulation can

14

become a taking.

15

taking, and it assumed arguendo that there was a taking

16

for a temporary period, compensation is required, and we

17

don't dispute that at all.

It said that if you have a temporary

taking.

21

First English wasn't a

That's your whole point.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's what the California

22

State courts determined on remand when they were addressed

23

with the question.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, no, just talk about Federal law.

You're saying that First English could not have been a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

taking, so we were just waiting our time up here.

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, no, no, not at all.

First

3

English could have been a taking.

4

an evaluation under, again, Penn Central, not Lucas, to

5

determine whether the regulation at issue there, both the

6

temporary and permanent, and both were at issue at

7

different points in First English, constituted a taking.

10

It would have required

But once you assume that that was a taking, and
you assume the results of that analysis, then it is a
taking.

Compensation is required.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The colloquy so far today seems to me to

20

illustrate the wisdom of Justice O'Connor's comment in her

21

concurring opinion in the Palazzolo case last June that

22

the Court should avoid per se rules in the area of

23

regulatory taking.

24
25

Petitioners knew per se rule of takings
jurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every

Alderson Reporting Company

1

freeze in the status quo, however brief, during a

2

permitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a

3

condemnation, to use their words --

4

QUESTION:

I don't understand it that way,

5

General Olson.

6

least certainly tried to separate out the normal zoning

7

process where you're working towards a permit and a permit

8

is realistically possible at the end of the road.

9

I thought Mr. Berger separated out, or at

GENERAL OLSON:

It seems to me that's a very

10

difficult distinction for him to make, because it requires

11

an analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in

12

each particular permitting process.

13

be short, we know that they can be long, we know that they

14

can be comprehensive.
QUESTION:

15

We know that they can

I don't think that's necessarily

16

true.

I think you can segregate, at least to my

17

satisfaction, the idea of a zoning requirement in

18

existence -- you have to file for a permit -- and

19

basically to show that you comply with the zoning

20

requirements.

21

zoning at all, a permit process is almost necessary as

22

opposed to a moratorium which doesn't say, you know, look,

23

24

whether you can build.

In other words, if you're going to have

It simply says no, you can't

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, what we would submit is

2

that that zoning permitting process is part of the

3

background principles of land use, land regulation, just

4

as temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's

5

rezoning process, a process referred to by this court in

6

the First English case, that process may have to come to a

7

halt.

8

The purpose for the temporary moratoria here was

9

to allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr.

10

Roberts has already noted by reference to the record,

11

there's no indication that it was not in good faith.

12

length of the period, 32 months, was held by the district

13

court to be a reasonable time to accomplish the

14

objectives.

15

the petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the

16

plan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they

17

indicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they

18

mentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building

19

permits was an appropriate governmental response to that

20

measure.

The

The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by

21

Now, in each instance the question is going to

22

be, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was

23

the Government up to?

24

to preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted.

25

They themselves purchased their property and planned to

Here, the Government was attempting

build a home on it because of the pristine quality of the

2

lake.

3

being degraded, that something had to be done about it.

4

limit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of

5

their brief -- was the logical objective to solve,

6

approach to solve that particular problem.

They make the argument in their brief that it was

7

A

So what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that

8

we're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait

9

a minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's

10

have a process in which we evaluate how to solve the

11

problem that every landowner around the lake, including

12

the petitioners, want to have solved.
QUESTION:

13

Well, that's extraordinary.

You

14

refer to it, General Olson, as just a traditional

15

moratorium.

16

moratorium at all. I think it's quite extraordinary to

17

just say, you know, a time out, nobody does anything with

18

this land.

19

of moratorium.

20

use that we anticipate we will ultimately impose.

21

very rare that you impose a complete prohibition of use,

22

because that's a condemnation.

I don't think this is a traditional

I just don't think that that's the normal kind
Nobody does anything beyond the limited

QUESTION:

involve -- total, right, yes.

3

Two cases, as I recall, that

GENERAL OLSON:

Two instances, and the first one

4

that they refer to is to aid the preparation of a

5

comprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining

6

permits that conflict with the plan being drafted.

7

is precisely almost the same words that were used by the

8

legislator in connection with the compact that suggested

9

that there ought to be a moratorium.

That

This is the compact

10

itself in the 1980 amendments.

11

it was necessary temporarily to halt works of development

12

in the region which might otherwise absorb the entire

13

capability of the region for further development or direct

14

it out of harmony with the ultimate plan.

15

It specifically said that

Now, if there is some challenge to the good

16

faith of what was going on here, that is not this case.

17

If there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I

18

think the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that,

19

well, if there was something that was done improperly to

20

take these people's property with respect to what happened

21

afterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a

22

particular property owner, that is the Penn Central test.

23

Now, for tactical reasons, the property owners

24

in this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case.

25

We heard here today that because it would be too expensive

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and too complicated for any individual property owner to

2

bring that case.

3

time anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a

4

piece of property.

Well, that is going to be the case every

5

These property owners decided to pool their

6

interest and decide not to show what the Government's

7

interest was, the degree of invasion in individual

8

property rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was

9

in good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically

10

all of those considerations.

11

Now, instead --

12

QUESTION:

13
14

With some reason, because they

couldn't use their property at all -- at all.
GENERAL OLSON:

They couldn't use their property

15

at all as far as this case was concerned, and the question

16

presented in this case, for a limited period of time while

17

a Government agency was acting to address the problem that

18

they acknowledge, because they acknowledge that continued

19

development along the lines that was occurring at the time

20

this moratorium was adopted was degrading the lake and

21

destroying their property.

22
23

QUESTION:

That's fine, and that's a general

social problem for which the entire society should pay.

24

GENERAL OLSON:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

If, indeed, you do need that time to

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

figure out what to do with the lake, why should some

2

individuals bear the burden of that necessary pause to

3

consider what to do?

4

GENERAL OLSON:

I submit it's the teaching of

5

this Court that not every delay, not every intrusion on

6

the use of property, not every incursion on property

7

rights constitutes a taking under the Fifth Amendment.

8
9

QUESTION:

I understand that, but these aren't

the only people who are using Lake Tahoe.

They're

10

preserving Lake Tahoe for all of the citizens of that

11

State and for citizens of other States, for that matter.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

13

QUESTION:

Well, Justice --

And yet they're saying, since we need

14

time to think about this, we are preventing total, total,

15

all the use of your land for 3 years.

16

GENERAL OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

Well --

I don't see that it seems to me fair

18

that these people should bear the whole brunt of the

19

moratorium.

20

GENERAL OLSON:

They haven't established that

21

they have bore the whole brunt.

22

the degree to which their individual property rights were

23

violated, or the extent of their intrusion.

24

done all of the things that this Court --

25

QUESTION:

They haven't established

They haven't

They've certainly established a

1

common situation.

2

was prevented from using the property for 3 years.

3

That is, every one of them, presumably,

GENERAL OLSON:

Because the use of that

4

property, as they acknowledge, would have destroyed the

5

very property rights that they're here seeking to

6

vindicate, and what we're saying is that in many different

7

situations the Government might have lots of reasons,

8

local governments, State governments, Federal Governments,

9

to cause a pause in the development.

10

Now, what --

11

QUESTION:

12

I agree with that, and that's what

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

15

GENERAL OLSON:

That's right, and --

That's exactly what worries me.
And that's why this Court in the

16

Penn Central case gave an opportunity to use a reasoned

17

decisionmaking to solve the problem, to find out how far

18

is too far.

19

did is to entertain the answer.

20

order to determine how far is too far, this Court has said

21

repeatedly we need to look at the circumstances.

22

To ask that very question that Justice Holmes
We need to know how -- in

decisionmaking process.

to try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi-

2

adjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as

3

instructed by Congress, a legislative process in which

4

things would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take

place --

QUESTION:

Well, no one is challenging their

7

authority in the sense of acting for the Government, but

8

the fact that they were instructed to do it by Congress

9

doesn't make it any more or any less of a taking.

10

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I understand that,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, but what I'm saying is that the

12

Government agencies that looked at this problem decided

13

that it had to be solved in a global way.

14

Government acting in a way we want it to act, in a

15

legislative process with transparency to look at the whole

16

problem and, if there had been a taking because it was too

17

long, or too much of an intrusion, there is a remedy under

18

the Fifth Amendment and it's described, how you get to

19

that remedy is described in this Court's jurisprudence in

the Penn Central case.

May I ask, do you understand your

opponent to be arguing that a curfew would be a taking?

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

A taking -- well, a curfew --

you couldn't go out after certain hours of the night, and

2

so the property was totally useless when the curfew --

3

would that be a taking under --

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think that they're

arguing that any momentary suspension of the use of

6

property would be a taking.

So it would be.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14

MR. BERGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Let me

touch briefly on a couple of things, if I might.
First, General Olson talked about this Court's

15

cases that generally have built on the question of, we

16

can't tell how far the regulation goes until we know how

17

far they went.

18

know precisely how far they went.

19

the use of all of the property owners who are here in

20

front of this Court, and it's that question that we're

21

here to answer.

22

need to get into any detailed, factual investigation of

23

other circumstances.

24
25

Well, that's true, and in this case we
They totally prohibited

Justice Kennedy asked about the First English
case, and whether the Court wasted its time there if the

1

Ninth Circuit's opinion in this case is simply affirmed,

2

and I would have to conclude that that is indeed what

3

happened.

4

Ninth Circuit did in this case would be to tell all the

5

lower courts that they need to pay no attention to First

6

English, because this Court laid out a lot of clear

7

messages in the First English decision that the Ninth

8

Circuit paid no attention to, and --

9

The clear message of merely affirming what the

QUESTION:

But it also said we merely hold --

10

this is from First English, stating the holding.

11

merely hold that where the Government's activities have

12

already worked a taking of all use of property, no

13

subsequent action by the Government can relieve it of the

14

duty to provide compensation for the period during which

15

the taking was effective.

16

MR. BERGER:

We

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, that

17

is true, and -- but what the Court said in First English

18

was that we're limiting, you were limiting the case to

19

what you called the facts presented in that case, and the

20

facts presented in that case were a temporary moratorium

21

for about the same length of time as the one that we're

22

dealing with here, which froze all use of that property

23

and, in fact, in my belief had a better justification for

24

it, because it had a health and safety justification,

25

which this one doesn't.

1

As you, justice Ginsburg, pointed out, the trial

2

court examined at great length the question of whether

3

these people were creating a nuisance and concluded that

4

there was no nuisance created here.

5

concerned about the fact that continued development around

6

Lake Tahoe might change the color of the lake, there was

7

no health problem with changing the color of the lake.

8

There was no safety problem with changing the color of the

lake.

appeal.
MR. BERGER:

That's correct, the court of

13

appeals did not deal with that question, only the district

14

court did, and its analysis is there for you to look at.

15

The 1980 compact amendments that the two

16

legislatures and Congress went through are interesting in

17

this case, because while they, in fact, said there was a

18

need for a moratorium, but the moratorium that the

19

legislators and Congress agreed to was not the one that

20

TRPA enacted here.

21

the number of building permits that are issued, and that's

22

in the record here, too, and they said we're going to

23

limit the number of building permits that each city and

24

county can issue to the number that they issued in 1978.

25

They said, what we need is a cap on

The first thing that TRPA did after that was

going to say, you can issue those permits, but you can't

totally frozen out, and they're being frozen out as part

5

of a major public project so that we can clarify the

waters in Lake Tahoe, and it just seems to us that where

you have these people who are being asked to make this

sacrifice on behalf of the greater public good, either of

the people who already own homes around Lake Tahoe, and

These people are

whose lands therefore gets more valuable, or on behalf of

11

the rest of us who don't own homes up there but who might

like to vacation there so that we can also enjoy the

beauties of Lake Tahoe, that those people shouldn't be

left flapping in the breeze with no compensation for the

15

fact that they're the ones that have been asked to pay for

this project.
