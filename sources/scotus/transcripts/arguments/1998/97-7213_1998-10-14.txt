15

Proceed, Mr. McCauley.

16

MR. McCAULEY:

The issue in this case is, if

17

this Court is to imply a mens rea element in the Federal

18

bank robbery statute, as both sides concede it must, then

19

the Court's decision in Morissette v. The United States

20

governs.

21

In Morissette v. The United States, the Court

22

held that it would imply a specific intent element into a

23

statute that codified a common law crime.

There, the statute itself had no

intent requirement, did it, in Morissette, statute by its

specifically has an element, intent to steal, whereas the

2

current codification of the bank robbery statute does not

3

have the word intent.

4

there's a phrase, to take from the person or presence of

5

another, which is the definitional term for steal.

6

QUESTION:

It has the steal language in that

And if intent is read into it, then

7

it -- bank larceny is a lesser-included offense, and if

8

intent is not read into the robbery statute, then bank

9

larceny is not a lesser-included offense?

10
11
12

MR. McCAULEY:

Yes, Your Honor, under this

Court's holding in Schmuck.
If it is read in, and we have the definitional

13

phrase connoting steal, then it mirrors the elements that

14

are at issue in the lesser offense, the intent to steal.

15

QUESTION:

Well, even if that is so, don't you

16

have a problem in this case, because the lesser-included

17

offense that you ask the charge to be given on was the

18

more serious of the two larceny offenses, i.e., theft of

19

something more than 1,000, and there's no requirement of

20

value of more than 1,000 in the robbery statute, so is it

21

not -- I guess another way to put my question is, is it

22

not the case that if you're right so far, the lesser of

23

the two larceny statutes may be a lesser-included offense,

24

but the one you asked for, which requires proof of more

25

than 1,000, is not?

MR. McCAULEY:

1

No, Justice Souter.

The $1,000

2

threshold that's in the two paragraphs of the larceny-

3

statute is not a requisite element of larceny.
QUESTION:

4

Well, why isn't it?

just said, in a separate paragraph.

6

the way sentencing elements are described.
MR. McCAULEY:

7

It is, as you

That's not usually

I submit that the $1,000

8

threshold is to distinguish between a felony larceny,

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McCAULEY:

12

13

Mm-hmm.
-- and a misdemeanor bank

larceny.
Now, the crime of robbery is always a felony,

14

and we were charged in the indictment with a crime of

15

robbery, and the indictment set forth amounts more than

16

$1,000, $9,000 in count 1 --

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but the test is not whether this

18

is lesser-included within the meaning of the indictment as

19

it charged the crime in fact.

20

reference to the statutory elements and, if that's the

21

test, then an element of more than $1,000, it seems to me,

22

defeats your case.

23

MR. McCAULEY:

It's -- the test is a

That's why it is our position,

24

and we urge the Court, that the $1,000 mentioned in the

two paragraphs of the larceny statute is not a requisite

QUESTION:

2

But if we take the position that it

3

is a requisite element, that's the end of your case,

4

right?
MR. McCAULEY:

5

I don't believe so, because

6

there's language in the robbery statute regarding monetary

7

value.
QUESTION:

$1,000.

Yes, but there's nothing about

If I steal -- if I rob the bank teller of $1,

10

I've committed the robbery offense.

11

the $1,000 larceny offense.
MR. McCAULEY:

12

13

No.

I've not committed

You would have committed the

misdemeanor larceny offense.
QUESTION:

14

I take it you think the $1,000 is

15

simply an amount that triggers different punishment

16

levels.

17

MR. McCAULEY:

Yes, and I think it's illustrated

18

by the indictment requirement, the Fifth Amendment right

19

to indictment, where any felony we're entitled to a right

20

to an indictment, where you wouldn't be entitled to a

21

right to an indictment on a misdemeanor larceny.

22

QUESTION:

Well, you said in your brief that the

23

model instructions for this crime also support your

24

position, but those model instructions tell the jury first

to find whether there's been larceny, and then if they do

more of value involved.

it's just a sentencing factor?

it legislated consider this a requisite element, when it

QUESTION:

Mr. McCauley, I know you didn't

7

intend this, but when you set forth section 2113 on page 2

8

of your brief I find it misleading.

9

It shows subsection (b) as containing only one

10

paragraph, whereas in fact, as shown in the

11

Government's -- the appendix to the Government's brief,

12

page 2a of the appendix, subsection (b) contains two

13

separate paragraphs, one of which is the $1,000, and the

14

other one is no value requirement at all, and I think that

15

makes a big difference as to whether you consider this

16

just a sentencing factor or a separate offense.

17

MR. McCAULEY:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Oh, it is a critical difference.

Well then, why didn't you set forth

the whole statute instead of just that one paragraph?
MR. McCAULEY:

Well, we apologize if that -- we

21

did not believe that that was at issue, that the Third

22

Circuit, the court below dropped a footnote, said this is

23

not an element, it's clearly a distinction between

24

felonious -- a felony and a misdemeanor.

25

Our understanding of the case law was that

1

that's the reason for the $1,000.

The critical element

2

that the court below was saying is missing from the

3

robbery statute is this intent to steal, and the position

4

is that that has always been in the robbery statute.

5

Government concedes it was a requisite element up until

6

1948 .

The

It's only with the recodification of title XVIII

7
8

in 1948 that the word intent in the form of the term

9

felonious is deleted, and that's explained by this Court

10

in the Prince matter, that it was just a change in

11

phraseology, and that -QUESTION:

12

Suppose the statute first said that

13

robbery must be done with intent to steal and to take

14

away, then 2 years later the Congress excises that phrase

15

intent.

16

by comparing the two statutes?

17

What would we take Congress' purpose to be, just

MR. McCAULEY:

Under the Court's holding in

18

Morissette, and reaffirmed 4 years ago in Staples and

19

X-Citement Video, you would require a specific statutory

20

statement saying that we are acting contrary to the common

21

law understandings of a common law crime.

22

QUESTION:

In other words, you understand

23

Morissette to say that Congress has to say, we are

24

enacting the statute contrary to the common law and the

25

foregoing paragraph is to be interpreted accordingly?

1

2

Does Congress have to say that?
MR. McCAULEY:

Yes.

That's my understanding in

3

Morissette with respect to common law crimes, crimes that

4

were malum in se at common law, not crimes that are malum

5

prohibitum.

6

As the Morissette case says, if we were dealing

7

with just regulatory offenses, it would not -- if this

8

Court, under its holding in Morissette, would not require

9

a specific contrary statement by Congress.

10

But the Court stated in the Morissette opinion

11

absent a specific statement to the contrary we will imply

12

this scienter requirement, this mens rea, this intent, and

13

there -- and I think what's also illustrating --

14

QUESTION:

Well, but Morissette didn't -- or

15

maybe it did.

16

the hypothetical that I put of a statute which is

17

specific, and then a statute that's changed the next year,

18

not as part of a recodification, just suppose that

19

Congress changes the one specific statute.

20

didn't involve that instance, did it?

21

Correct me if I'm wrong -- didn't involve

MR. McCAULEY:

Yes.

Morissette

Felonious had fallen out of

22

section 641, the statute that was interpreted in

23

Morissette, and the Court --

24

QUESTION:

25

Felonious did.

Felonious did, but

what -- suppose the words were, with intent to steal.

Same rule?
MR. McCAULEY:

2

Yes, the same rule, because the

3

Court in Morissette said, anything, these critical

4

elements, whether they be actus reis or mens reas, that

5

had been established in the more important part of

6

criminal jurisprudence, they are not changed --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. McCAULEY:

9

QUESTION:

0

Well ---by inadvertence.

Well, that was an -- that's an

extraordinary position you're taking,

that in -- the

11

statute at one time says with intent to steal, and

12

Congress passes a law saying, we repeal the requirement

3

that there be an intent to steal, and you're saying in

4

effect Congress can't do that.
MR. McCAULEY:

No.

No.

statement that the Court is looking for in the Morissette

9

QUESTION:

Well, but then you have to answer the

Chief Justice's question differently, and you have to

10

appeal to legislative history instead of simply asking --

11

answering his question that it -- that you accept the fact

12

that if the word is there, and is then repealed by

13

Congress, the common law requirement is eliminated,

14

because that is the situation here.

15

MR. McCAULEY:

I understand the Chief Justice's

16

question to say if Congress says we're repealing that,

17

that is a specific statement to the contrary --

Congress has to say it in addition to

understand the text, and if it's a common law offense, the

3

Court's -- under the Court's precedents an implied --

4

specific intent will be implied in -QUESTION:

5
6

That's an equally extraordinary

position, it seems to me.
You have a situation where the statute at one

7
8

time says, with intent to steal, and then Congress passes

9

a law that says, you know, enacted by Congress and so

10

forth, that the words intent to steal are hereby deleted

11

from the statute, and there are no committee reports, no

12

legislative history.
Now, does that successfully get rid of the

13
14

intent to steal requirement?
MR. McCAULEY:

15

Yes.

That's a specific statement

16

by the Congress that it is deleting that element that has

17

previously been there.

QUESTION:

is enough.

It's a deletion, and that, I gather,

That is not the situation here

MR. McCAULEY:

1

That felonious was deleted as a

2

matter of phraseology to tidy up the statutes in 1948 that

3

had become cumbersome through the repeated use of the

4

term, felony and misdemeanors.

5

QUESTION:

We don't -- as I understand it, we

6

wouldn't necessarily have to go to legislative history for

7

that conclusion, would we, because I assume what we would

8

find, if we went through the codification, is that two

9

things happened.
They took out the word feloniously in all the

10
11

statutes that used to have feloniously in it, and they

12

simultaneously enacted a new definitional section which

13

described as a matter of definition what a felony is and

14

what a misdemeanor is, and I take it we could infer from

15

that, without even getting to legislative history

16

explanations, that what they were doing, as you said, was

17

sort of tidying up.

18

They were taking out what they thought were

19

merely useless words of classification, but nothing more.

20

Is that fair to say?
MR. McCAULEY:

21

Yes, and what they did not

22

delete -- and in 1937, that was the first modification of

23

the original bank robbery statute that was enacted in

24

1934.

25

history is not malleable on this.

The Prince case explains and the legislative

1

The statement is, it's an act, the 1937 act is

2

an act to include lesser-included offenses of robbery, and

3

it was in response to the Justice Department writing to

4

the Congress saying, they had an example where someone

5

went into the bank and took the money, but there was no

6

force, threat, or intimidation, and they couldn't be

7

prosecuted under the robbery statute because of the

8

robbery's requirement of that extra element of force,

9

threat, or intimidation.

10

And the Congress responded and entitled the act,

11

Bank Robbery and Incidental Crimes, and their statement in

12

the legislative history specifically stated, this is an

13

act to amend the bank robbery statute to include the

14

lesser offenses of bank burglary and bank larceny.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. McCAULEY:

17

QUESTION:

They said the words, lesser offenses?
Yes.

Because it's one thing to say they

18

filled a gap that the bank robbery statute left open, and

19

another to say that the way they filled it was by creating

20

a lesser-included offense.

21

MR. McCAULEY:

Yes.

I believe the statement,

23

statute to include the lesser offenses.

Then what you're saying is that the

Both statutes

Absent a contrary expression that

I thought your position was that the

any different when you're talking about larceny than a

I thought you said that the whole thing that

saying something different, no, you need more in the bank

17

MR. McCAULEY:

You

In the bank robbery statute, I'm

18

relying on the Court's holding in Morissette and its

19

prodigy to put that critical mens rea intent element in

20

where felonious had been, and felonious had modified the

21

definitional term of steal.

22

So up until 1948, we had intent to take from the
person of another, intent to steal.

because it doesn't appear, the robbery statute doesn't

2

embrace, fully embrace the requisite elements of the

3

larceny statute.

4

it's not a lesser-included offense.

5

So under Schmuck, as a matter of law,

I say, as a matter of law, intent is there

6

implicitly, impliedly by the Court's precedents, and that

7

when felonious was taken out, absent a specific

8

congressional statement that they were doing that

intentionally and not by inadvertence.

They were not looking to revolutionize the
understanding of robberies and larcenies --

QUESTION:

But there's another --

13

MR. McCAULEY:

14

QUESTION:

-- which they recodified in 1948.

Isn't there another problem, that the

15

criminal intent can be one of two kinds?

16

general intent to violate the law, which Morissette says

17

we will always imply, or it can be more specific, an

18

intent to deprive the person permanently of the property.

19

You could have the former without having the latter.

20

MR. McCAULEY:

21

QUESTION:

It can be a

Yes.

And I think one of the Government's

22

argument is that, well, you have the former in (a) but not

23

necessarily the latter, and what is your response to that?

24
25

MR. McCAULEY:

Well, that essentially turns the

reasoning of Morissette on its head, because Morissette

said, when we're dealing with statutory definitions or

2

codification of common law offenses, we will imply this

3

evil mens rea, specific intent.

holding and the rationale in Morissette.

I believe that is the

We would not do it, we would allow for a general

5
6

intent in other offenses, public welfare offenses,

7

regulatory offenses.

8

But where Congress legislates in the traditional

9

common law area of crimes, absent a specific statement, it

10

will be the specific intent that the Court would apply.
QUESTION:

11

I don't understand these words,

12

specific intent, et cetera, so in my own mind it comes

13

down to just what Justice Stevens said, that the

14

difference, whether there's a specific intent or not, from

15

any practical point of view, is whether a person who goes

16

into a bank, puts out a gun, takes the money, goes out of

the bank, but he did it with an intent to return the

money, you see.

have you found any case, ever, in history, where there was

such a person, where in fact he put the gun up -- I mean,

we found one, almost, in the Sentencing Commission, where

MR. McCAULEY:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, with

14

respect to the first hypothetical, that I really thought

it was my money, that had been a defense at common law.

16

Under claim of right, if a person was recovering their own

money by force and violence, that could defend and defeat

18

the mens rea, the evil intent.

19

However, Congress, in drafting this language,

20

and the text of this statute, both the larceny provision

21

and the robbery provision has the added language that

22

takes away that defense of claim of right.

When feloniously was removed from the

11

would be easier, I guess, to go back to my original

12

question.

3

Before feloniously was removed from the statute,

4

the Federal robbery statute never required an asportation

5

because in your view that was not a requirement of common

6

law and would not have been read into it under the words

7

feloniously or in any other way, is that correct?

8

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, but let me explain further,

9

because the asportation requirement was a requirement of

20

robbery at common law, and feloniously did not encompass

2

the asportation requirement.

22

They were distinct.

If you look at Blackstone, Blackstone says

23

feloniously takes and carries away, using force in the

person or presence of another.

MR. FREDERICK:

correct, Justice Souter.

QUESTION:

But if you define an -- call an

jurisprudence that we would assume that the traditional

16

asportation requirement was not eliminated simply by the

17

failure to recite it.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I'm glad that you raised

19

Morissette, because I think there is some confusion about

20

what the Court addressed and what it held.

21

The Court in Morissette did not hold that when

22

Congress has defined terms using non-common law words, and

23

six of the eight elements of this bank robbery statute

24

depart from the common law, Morissette did not say you

25

read in common law requirements.

In fact, in Morissette, as the Court explains in

1

2

footnote 28 of its opinion, in describing the drafting

3

history of section 641, Congress used the word converts,

4

which was a common law word, and the question before the

5

Court was, what did Congress mean when it used the word

6

converts?

7

It had not appeared in any of the predecessor

8

sections of that statute, and so what the Court held was

9

that in tort cases a conversion could occur by an

10

unwitting action if there was some negligence or something

11

in the interference with the property rights of the true

12

owner.

13

So in reading -- but at common law the crime of

14

conversion required an intent to steal, so what the Court

15

held in Morissette was that because Congress had used the

16

words, knowingly converts in a crime, that it must have

17

meant to include the intent to steal, because otherwise

18

innocent conduct would be subject to the criminal

19

sanction.

1

That footnote also says the 1948

codify those then in existence.

MR. FREDERICK:

How would you describe

What we know, Justice Kennedy,

is that the word feloniously was removed from the statute.

way, didn't it?

3

to steal, larceny does.

And robbery doesn't have the word intent

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

One possibility is that's simply an

6

oversight, or they assumed it would be read in, and the

7

other possibility is no, Congress did it purposely,

8

leaving out the words, intent to steal, or feloniously,

9

because Congress wanted to be sure that the person in

10

Justice Scalia's hypothetical who unfortunately is trying

11

to steal his own money, or the person in my hypothetical

12

who, in fact, takes it out the door, walks around the

13

block and wants to give it back, that that's what Congress

14

wanted to do.

15

Congress wanted to punish those two people.

Now, those seem to be the only two hypotheses I

16

can think of, and it's obvious from the way I've stated it

17

that I find the second hypothesis totally fanciful, but

18

perhaps -- I mean, there's never been such a case, there

19

never will be such a case, so the notion that Congress

20

wanted to punish those two cases which will never occur is

21

fanciful.
The notion that it wanted to keep the same

22

23

requirement, and had nothing more in mind than everybody

24

read it in, is not fanciful, so what's your response to

that?

the laws in 1948 --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. FREDERICK:

2 years before Congress codified

Yes.
-- it enacted a definition of

5

robbery in the Hobbs Act which did not contain an intent

6

to steal, but which underscored the seriousness Congress

7

attached to forceful takings of property in the presence

8

or from the person of another, and it is clear, as Judge

9

Coffin in the First Circuit said in the DeLeo case in 1970

10

that the acts of robbery are so unambiguously dangerous as

11

to make implicit the mental element underlying the

12

offense.

13

Our position is that robbery and the way

14

Congress has defined it go to the means that the person

15

uses to take the property from another, whereas larceny is

16

addressed to the ends that the person intends when he has

17

taken the property, and they are two different offenses.

18
19
20

Robbery is an offense against the person, and
larceny is an offense involving property.
QUESTION:

Are there cases involving the Hobbs

21

Act -- there's none in this Court -- in which we've said

22

that the intent to steal does not -- is not included, but

23

are there cases in the courts of appeals?

additional mental element of intent to steal or other --

2

any other special intent requirement, as Congress drafted

3

in three different provisions of the bank robbery statute.

4

The knowing, knowing that the stolen property,

5

the receiver of stolen property has to know that it is

6

stolen in 2113(c), in 2113(b) the intent to steal, and in

7

second paragraph, 2113(a), the bank burglary offense

8

Congress drafted that the person entering the bank has to

9

do so with intent to commit a felony.

10

So it is clear that there are specific textual

11

indicators of this statute that underscore that Congress

12

knew how to include a special mental element but did not

13

do so in the bank robbery offense.

14

QUESTION:

Let me ask you, Mr. Frederick, about

15

the common law defense to the crime of robbery, and as I

16

defense if the defendant thought it was his own property.

MR. FREDERICK:

instances where Congress could really want a lesser-

let's say.

(b) is lesser-included of (a),

13

And then it takes (b) and it divides it into two

14

or three parts, one part being a misdemeanor, another part

15

being a felony, another part being a more serious felony,

16

it would turn out even though Congress wanted it to be a

17

less -- a lesser-included offense, you never could get the

18

charge, because you'd have to pick (a) or (b) or (c).

2, or version 3, since one or the other would fit your

that exceeding $1,000 is not an element of the offense.

of that fact.

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Is there any indication

anywhere that Congress wanted to punish that as bank

MR. FREDERICK:

4

No, except for the words of the

statute, which suggest that Congress wanted to deal with

people who forcefully took property from the person or

think, unsocial behavior, and that is the essence of our

3

I'm still -- and you agree, I take it, or don't

you, that if Congress had wanted, in (a) it has bank

All right.

Now, do you think Congress could

have said, and by the way, being a little informal, we

It could have said that.

QUESTION:

Do you think that Congress gives a

6

lot of intent in drafting statutes as to whether one is a

7

lesser-included offense than the other?

8

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, in some instances it is

clear that Congress has intended to do that.

In other

instances, it is less clear.

11

QUESTION:

You say this is not one of them.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, this is one where Congress

13

did, we submit, think about the overall concept of lesser-

14

included offenses, because it made aggravated robbery a

15

greater offense of simple robbery.

16

QUESTION:

Really?

Do you really think that a

17

majority of the Members of Congress even knew that the

18

word feloniously had been dropped from this provision,

19

much less had a particular intent as to what the dropping

20

of it meant?

21

Do you really think that?

MR. FREDERICK:

What we know is that the act

22

that they all voted on did not have the word feloniously

in it, and --

1

robbery under (a), then there can be no receiving stolen

2

property under (c) without your going ahead and showing

3

that the elements of larceny were really there anyway.

4

That seems to me a little odd.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

QUESTION:

The omission --

I mean, you're going to have

7

robberies under (a) that you prosecute under (a), but then

8

you have people who receive stolen property and you're

9

going to have to show there's a (b) offense.

10
11

That seems

to me a strange way to operate.
MR. FREDERICK:

It is, and the Court dealt with

12

that in Gaddis by saying that it functionally was to be

13

construed that the person -- if the property had been

14

stolen through a robbery, that intent requirement is what

15

had to be established there even though the word a)

16

doesn't appear in the subsection (c) --

17

QUESTION:

And to that extent it seems to me,

18

even given Gaddis, that the (c) problem helps the

19

petitioner more than you.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, as to who it helps more,

21

it's six of one, half-dozen of the other, because (c) also

22

includes a special mental element indicating that Congress

23

knew how to put special mental elements in these

24

provisions when it wanted to, and it did not do that for

25

the robbery provision.

So -- Gaddis also says that

1

(c) is not a lesser

2

offense of (a) and (b), that it is a distinct offense

3

because of the different elements that were required to be

4

proved for that.
Now, I would like to make one final point before

5
6

closing, and that is that a number of courts of appeals,

7

in addressing the question of intent under this statute,

8

have faced claims by defendants that they lacked the

9

requisite intent to commit bank robbery either because

10

they were involuntarily intoxicated or they were on LSD,

11

or they had psychic problems, or some other nature that

12

would negate the specific intent that they thought had to

13

be proved under the provision.

14

An argument that robbery has such a special mens

15

rea raises the specter that defendants will attempt to

16

negate that element of intent.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask you one historical

18

question?

19

that differ from common law robbery such as the care,

20

custody, and control of the bank and so forth.

elements in the statute before 1948?

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

The 1934 act

2

was whoever by force and violence, or by putting in fear,

3

feloniously takes, or feloniously attempts to take from

4

the person or presence of another any property or money or

5

any other thing of value belonging to or in the care,

6

custody, control, management, or possession of any bank,

7

and the subse -- I mean, that core language has basically

8

stayed with the provision from 1934 to the present day.

9

If there are no further questions, we would

10

submit that the decision should be affirmed.
