ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL ROSENBERG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENBERG:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
By statute in Iowa, police are authorized to

10
11

search any motor vehicle in which the driver receives a

12

traffic citation.

13

Iowa's search incident citation statute shall be adopted

14

by this Court as a new category of per se reasonable

15

searches.

The question presented here is whether

16

It was in March of 19 --

17

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that's what the statute

18

does.

The statute says, I believe, the issuance of a

19

citation in lieu of arrest or in lieu of continued custody

20

does not affect the officer's authority to conduct an

21

otherwise lawful search.

22

whether this was a lawful search, not whether the statute

23

said there can be a full-blown search.

24

it to the subsequent determination of whether the search

25

was lawful.

So, I took it that the issue was

I thought it left

Now, in this case, the Iowa court said that a

1

2

full search was lawful but, in the course of that, seemed

3

to rely, at least in part, on Federal law under the Fourth

4

Amendment.
MR. ROSENBERG:

5

Well, the Iowa Supreme Court has

6

construed this language that says otherwise lawful search

7

to extend the search incident to - - excuse me - - search

8

incident to arrest exception to encompass those

9

circumstances where a citation is issued and there is in

10

fact -QUESTION:

11

Well, I thought what the court below

12

did was to say that a full search on the occasion of a

13

traffic citation was lawful in their view.

14

what happened?

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Isn't that

Yes, they did say that.

It isn't that the statute

17

requires that result.

18

lawful.

19

under the Federal Constitution that's correct.

They said that kind of a search is

So, I guess what we have to decide is whether

20

MR. ROSENBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

21

In March of 1996, Mr. Knowles was pulled over

22

for speeding in Newton, Iowa.

In all respects, this was a

23

routine traffic encounter.

the single deterrent to pull over.

were no warrants for his arrest, and the police officer

testified that he had no suspicion -QUESTION:

3

Mr. Rosenberg, could you just back up

4

for a minute because in your answer to Justice O'Connor,

5

you said something that I didn't understand you had

challenged.

7

contested the authority to make a full custodial arrest

for speeding.

11

question that Justice Stewart left over in the Gustafson

12

case, which was whether you could have constitutionally a

13

full arrest for a traffic violation.

14

that question?

15

But I hadn't realized that you had raised the

MR. ROSENBERG:

We didn't raise the question of

16

lawfulness of the arrest.

17

lawfulness of the subsequent search.

18

QUESTION:

Where did you raise

We're only questioning the

Well, then your answer to Justice

19

O'Connor was not right because she asked you if you were

contesting the authority to make a full custodial arrest

21

on the basis of a traffic violation, and you said you

22

were.

23

making a more limited challenge, that is, if -- assuming

24

they could make a full custodial arrest, they didn't.

25

they did was issue a citation.

But I understood that you were not, that you were

called a pot pipe.

law.

He was

The Supreme Court, in deciding Mr. Knowles'

10

appeal, essentially held that the search incident to

11

arrest doctrine, which in United States v. Robinson was

12

held to be a per se reasonable search, that this doctrine

13

was going to be extended by the State of Iowa by virtue of

14

the statute to situations in which a citation was issued.

15

The fundamental premise of the Iowa Supreme

16

Court's decision was that the search incident to arrest

17

doctrine does not require a custodial arrest.

18

requires grounds for arrest or cause for arrest.

19

premise is incorrect.

It existed at the common law in

this country and in England, and it was always thought to

was assumed, reasonable search.

QUESTION:

Do you think it's -- it's clear that

a stop or a traffic offense committed in the officer's

presence is not an arrest?

MR. ROSENBERG:

QUESTION:

11

Is that clear?

MR. ROSENBERG:

10

The actual --

The actual stop would not be an

arrest.

12

QUESTION:

Is the person free to leave?

13

MR. ROSENBERG:

No.

That would be a -- a -- a

14

seizure, a brief detention, and this Court has held that

15

it's a seizure.

officer would have to essentially handcuff the person and

17

take them to the police station.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Handcuffs are required?
All arrested persons are

handcuffed, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, would you agree then if the

22

officer made the valid stop and exercised the -- the

23

option, which -- which it is understood I think clearly

24

that he has, to require the driver to get out of the car,

25

the officer at that point could at least have -- have gone

Do you --do you concede that?
If he had the necessary

suspicion - QUESTION:

5

No.

He's -- well, we assume that

6

it's a valid stop for a traffic violation, and we assume

7

that he has ordered the person out of the car so that the

8

driver is standing right in front of him.

9

then have -- have conducted a Terry pat-down without more?
MR. ROSENBERG:

10
11

Could he not

He could have conducted a Terry

pat-down.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

13

QUESTION:

That would be regardless of any

14

suspicion caused by the appearance of the person or bulge

15

in his waist or something like that?

16

MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, as recently as Minnesota

17

v. Dickerson, the -- this Court has reaffirmed the

18

requirement of Terry, that there be some articulable basis

19

to believe this person is armed and dangerous.

20

QUESTION:

That's why I don't understand your

21

response to Justice Souter.

22

mere fact that the person was speeding creates such an

23

articulable reason why you have to search the person?

QUESTION:

Then your answer to me should have

2

been different, shouldn't it?

3

no, he does not have the basis for a Terry pat-down?

4

MR. ROSENBERG:

5

QUESTION:

Shouldn't you have said,

Yes, that's correct.

Well, you've -- you have conceded

6

that he could have been arrested, and what is it under

7

Iowa law that it takes, you said, handcuffs going to the

station?

words before he searched the driver and the passenger and

MR. ROSENBERG:

13

Suppose he said, you're under

If he had done that, then it

14

would have been a valid search incident to a lawful

15

arrest.

QUESTION:

So, the whole thing turns on whether

the officer says you're under -- you're under arrest or

21

MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, but that is a distinction

that - - that - QUESTION:

Then what happened to the handcuffs

22

and the station?

I'm trying to determine what constitutes

23

an arrest under Iowa law, and if all it takes is the

words, you're under arrest, then it's a different case

It necessarily entails

Well, then you're giving a different

answer to the one you gave before when I asked you, is it

is -- the officer says, you're under arrest.

a full search when you have an arrest, take the person

into custody, the -- as we said in - - in Robinson, those

facts are not present when you simply issue a citation.

MR. ROSENBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Suppose the police officer said, look

it, I'm entitled to arrest you and take you to the

MR. ROSENBERG:

I'm just going to

I think under Bumpers v. North

11

Carolina, that would be a legitimate reason for

12

questioning the voluntariness of that consent because that

13

would be - - just be an acquiescence and a claim of lawful

14

authority by the police officer.

QUESTION:

I would question --

Well, if the officer had the right to

take him into custody, why couldn't he give him that

MR. ROSENBERG:

15

QUESTION:

He

That's correct.

Could I ask you, in your -- in your

researches on the common law, did the common law draw a

distinction between a -- what you've called a custodial

arrest and a non-custodial arrest?

with the proliferation of a lot of minor misdemeanor

offenses in this country, that the citation came into

5

vogue as a more reasonable manner in which to - - to

prosecute a criminal offense.

7

QUESTION:

But I also believe

I think you mistook my question.

8

guess I'm really asking whether in the common law all

9

seizures of the person were not considered arrests.

I

Is it

10

clear that there were two categories of seizures of the

11

person, one of which was just, you know, a temporary

12

traffic stop and another one was what you call a full

13

custodial arrest?

14

MR. ROSENBERG:

I -- I do not know that the

15

common law distinguished between a -- a simple seizure of

16

the person and an arrest.

17

QUESTION:

I think that a lot --

Well, if that's the case, then --

18

then -- and if it didn't, then the long history of -- of

19

allowing searches of this sort only in connection with an

20

arrest could be a long history of allowing searches in

21

connection with a traffic stop, whether you give a

22

citation or not.

23

MR. ROSENBERG:

The only common law history that

24

I'm aware of is that which was referred to in United

25

States v. Robinson where the Court indicated that the

common law authority or historical sources in this respect

2

were scarce.

QUESTION:

And the Court -Well, I guess we didn't have a lot of

cars and trucks back in the 1600's and the 1700's.
(Laughter.)

6

MR. ROSENBERG:

7

QUESTION:

We didn't have any.

If we move forward from the common

8

law to cases decided by this Court, Berkemer against

9

McCarty you cite in your brief I guess for the proposition

10

that a traffic stop is not an arrest.
MR. ROSENBERG:

11

That's correct, but I believe

12

later this Court clarified its decision in Berkemer and

13

said if the officer had told this individual that he was

14

under arrest at the inception of this particular

15

encounter, then the Court would have considered that an

16

arrest.

a guess at that.

That was a clarification?
Oh, it was?

I assume -I don't know if it was a

I don't -- I'm not going to venture

23

There's another reason that searches incident to

24

arrest differ from searches incident to citation, and that

But I would like

to say this, if there is such a citation that would

probable cause to believe that an offense has occurred and

13

Very well, Mr. Rosenberg.

MS. CHAMBERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1983, Iowa passed a statute which allowed

14

officers to use citations for almost any offense.

same time, the Iowa legislature authorized -- stated that

16

-- that when a citation is issued, officers may still

applies to the search of his car made after he was issued

QUESTION:

But your argument is there would be

5

no constitutional objection to a strip search for a

6

traffic citation.

7

MS. CHAMBERS:

No.

That's the second prong of

8

our answer, and clearly under this Court's prior decisions

9

in the context of search incident to custodial arrests, a

10

strip search can only be made under certain very carefully

11

restricted circumstances which I cannot conceive could

12

exist in the context of a jaywalking or -- or other city

13

ordinance violation.

14

It's probable cause to arrest which also

15

prevents random suspicion-less searches which were a major

16

part of the petitioner's brief in this case.

17

QUESTION:

Do you acknowledge that the rule

18

you're asking us to confirm today, the Iowa opinion, is an

19

extension of our previous cases?

20

MS. CHAMBERS:

The -- it's the State's position

21

that in interpreting Iowa Code section 805.1(4), the Iowa

22

court simply says that statute authorizes whatever the

23

Fourth Amendment authorizes and then went on to decide

24

that the Fourth Amendment does authorize search incident

25

to citation.

So, yes.

-- not only our constitutional categories but our

constitutional protections intact, to say that in that

case it's better for the officer to make the custodial

QUESTION:

In the States except for Iowa.

2

But now, with Iowa's statute on the books, I

suppose in Iowa now the police are routinely making

searches in these situations?
MS. CHAMBERS:

5

No.

Actually, Your Honor,

6

although the statute went into effect in 1983, this

practice is far from routine for a couple of reasons.

8

think one could infer that one of the reasons is that

likely advising cautious law enforcement officials to

exercise a great deal of care in this area.

MS. CHAMBERS:

It's certainly one of the two --

QUESTION:

10

But that presumption doesn't accord

with the facts even as Iowa officers now understand.
MS. CHAMBERS:

11

Well, certainly just as the law

12

currently allows custodial arrest and search in every

13

situation, which is unquestionably constitutional and

14

conceded by -- by Knowles, and officers currently are not

15

searching in all those cases, they would -- they would

behave presumably similarly under search incident to

18

The -- the fact that officers exercise

discretion certainly doesn't defeat the rule.

20

presumes that it's reasonable under the Fourth Amendment

21

because of concerns with preservation of error and officer

safety, and if officers subjectively choose not to go to

things and that is that one of the things that Knowles'

proposal would require is for this Court to frequently get

into the issue of the officer's subjective intent, an

examination that this Court has rejected time after time

after again -- time after time and most recently in Whren.
The reason that we'd have to get into that is

this.

Some of the examples posed by the Court dealt with

when the officer made the decision to search, and it would

20

be an open question, what happens if the officer makes the

search and then doesn't issue the citation until later or

then makes the custodial arrest subsequently?

But arrest is an objective thing.

MS. CHAMBERS:

It is, but that would, of course,
