ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. KIRWIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. KIRWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about two principles that this

12

Court has emphasized repeatedly in recent years, upholding

13

the traditional scope of sovereignty of the States, and

14

upholding the plain language of treaties with the Indians.

15

At issue here is an Indian privilege to hunt and

16

fish in an area of Minnesota that the Chippewa Indians

17

ceded to the Federal Government in an 1837 treaty.

18

the treaty, this privilege of hunting, fishing, and

19

gathering, was guaranteed to the Indians only during the

20

pleasure of the President.

21

this dispute.

22

Under

That phrase is at the heart of

The State asserts that there are three

23

independent events which terminated the temporary

24

privilege under the 1837 treaty, an executive order in

25

1850, which expressly revoked the treaty privilege,

1

Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858 on an equal

2

footing with the original States, and an 1855 treaty which

3

revoked any and all rights the Indians had at that time in

4

Minnesota but which relates to only one of the bands in

5

this case.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Kirwin, may I ask you to clarify

7

what was the nature of the right?

in the briefs.

9

person would have to hunt and fish, or just the same

10

It's a little confusing

Is it a superior right to what any other

right?
MR. KIRWIN:

11

Your Honor, the lower courts held,

12

based on this Court's decision in the cases from the

13

Northwestern United States, that it's a superior right

14

that it guarantees the bands the right to take an

15

allocation of the fish and game that are available to hunt

16

without complying with the regulations of the State that

17

apply to other persons.

18
19

QUESTION:

In 1837, was there any difference,

because as I understand it there weren't any regulations.
MR. KIRWIN:

20

In 1837, Your Honor, there weren't

21

any regulations, and there weren't any until Minnesota

22

became a State in 1858 and enacted hunting and fishing

23

laws .

24
25

QUESTION:

So that legally, if the revocation

had occurred in 1838, all of the members of the Indian

1

bands could have continued to do, so far as the law was

2

concerned, exactly what they thought they had a right to

3

do under the treaty, is that correct?
MR. KIRWIN:

4

That would be true, Your Honor, as

5

long as neither the Federal Government nor the territories

6

that covered that area passed any hunting and fishing

7

laws .

8

9

QUESTION:
as you said.

10

MR. KIRWIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Right, but in fact there were none,

That's right.
So if there had been a revocation --

excuse me -- they could have gone on doing it.
MR. KIRWIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and we

14

think that the principal effect of the privilege and the

15

revocation of the privilege was something that was

16

recognized by President Andrew Jackson in his 1829 State

17

of the Union address, and he said that if the Indians were

18

asked to voluntarily remove from the area but refused to

19

do so, then they would have to understand that they would

20

be subject to the laws of the State, and so as the lower

21

courts interpreted this privilege, the effect of it is to

22

make the Indians not subject to many of the laws of the

23

States of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

24
25

QUESTION:

But I thought it was conceded that

the State can place some limits on the harvest that the

1

Indians can take.

Isn't that -- that puzzled me.

2

authority can the State impose some limitations?
MR. KIRWIN:

3

By what

Your Honor, what this Court has

4

said in the cases coming from the Northwest United States,

5

Puyallup II, Antoine, Passenger Fishing Vessel, is that

6

the State can regulate in the interest of conservation,

7

the lower courts have extended that to health and safety,

8

but that the State's regulatory authority is limited.

9

There are significant encroachments on the State's

10

regulatory authority.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what could the State do, in

12

your view, under the cases from the Pacific Northwest in

13

terms of regulation or limiting the season for taking fish

14

and game, or the quantity?

15

MR. KIRWIN:

Your Honor, it appears under the

16

lower courts rulings in this case, based on this Court's

17

earlier decisions, that the State would be very limited in

18

regulating to limit hunting and fishing seasons, for

19

example.

20

If the bands were to insist on --

21

QUESTION:

Well, it's very unclear to me what

22

you think, under existing precedent, if we were to affirm,

23

what do you think the State could do in terms of

24

regulation?

25

MR. KIRWIN:

If the bands insisted on taking

1

more than half of the resource, the State probably could

2

prevent that with the Federal court's assistance.

3

QUESTION:

Why?

Why so?

I mean, if the treaty

4

gives them hunting and fishing rights, I assume they can

5

hunt and fish to their heart's content.

6

MR. KIRWIN:

Your Honor, in the cases from the

7

Northwestern United States, this Court seemed to recognize

8

that the Indians had a right to a share of the hunting and

9

fishing resource, but that non-Indians also had a right to

10

a share, and so this Court said that 45 or 50 percent

11

might be the maximum Indian share.

12

this case seemed, although it's not entirely clear from

13

their opinions, they seem to have adopted --

14

QUESTION:

The lower courts in

In the Pacific Northwest cases some

15

of them ended up with the district court kind of serving

16

almost as a master, didn't they, in allocating various

17

percentages?

18

MR. KIRWIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

19

ruling on particular kinds of regulation, and the State's

20

concern here is that under the lower court's decision,

21

that we have the same situation already.

22

QUESTION:

What has been worked out in

23

Wisconsin, where there's been a previous decision

24

upholding the right of the tribes to hunt and fish, and

25

yet the State has somehow worked out some kind of a -- an

agreement with the tribe.

2

worked out?

3

MR. KIRWIN:

What sort of agreement has been

Your Honor, the ground rules, as I

4

understand them in Wisconsin, are that the bands are

5

entitled to take half of the available resource, and so

6

the -- and the State of Wisconsin then has been required

7

to allow the bands to do that.

QUESTION:

MR. KIRWIN:

At any time, without regard to the

Without regard to hunting seasons

11

or times of day and so on.

12

regulations for purposes of conserving or assuring the

13

preservation of the species.

14

regulations for purposes of public safety, but there is

15

certainly a significant encroachment on the State's

16

ability to regulate under this Court's decisions and as

17

they've been applied by the lower court here.

18

QUESTION:

The State can make limited

The States can make limited

This applies only, of course, on

19

public lands on which hunting and fishing are permitted.

20

It doesn't extend to private --

21

MR. KIRWIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, yes,

22

and the State asserts that this hunting and fishing

23

privilege was terminated by three events, but the most

24

basic of these, we think, was the President's executive

25

order in 1850 expressly terminating the privilege.

QUESTION:

The parties stay away from any

property analogies.

not helpful.

This is a -- and this is a discrete area of

This is -MR. KIRWIN:

6

Your Honor, there was some

7

discussion in the lower courts, particularly by the

8

landowners, as to what the particular nature of the right

9

might be.
As far as the State is concerned, it probably is

10
11

unique.

What's unique about it is that it's something

12

that comes from the Indian title to the land, and so it's

13

part of the Indian title which includes an element of

14

sovereignty or quasi-sovereignty, but what this Court made

15

clear in the Winans case is that when Indians cede land to

16

the Federal Government, but there's a reserved hunting and

17

fishing right, that what's reserved is a part of, a

18

remnant of that original interest that the Indians had in

19

the land.

20

QUESTION:

I don't --

21

QUESTION:

But it's a sovereign interest and not

22

a property interest that we're talking about, or not a

23

sovereign interest, depending on how you come out.

2

rather than some other part of it, but nonetheless it

3

certainly is --

4

It may be the sovereignty part of that

QUESTION:

Well, is there any authority from

5

this Court that the right to hunt and fish is an interest

6

in real property?

7

MR. KIRWIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KIRWIN:

10

QUESTION:

Your Honor -Have we treated it as such?
I think -That's such an odd concept, because

11

if a non-Indian person wanted to hunt or fish, one

12

wouldn't talk about that in terms of a property interest,

13

would they?

14

MR. KIRWIN:

Right, and I think, Your Honor,

15

that it's different when you're dealing with Indian

16

cessions of property, as the Court recognized in Winans,

17

as the Court recognized in the Klamath case, where the

18

Court said that where the Indians ceded all right, title,

19

and interest to the land, the Court said, undoubtedly any

20

special rights they had to hunt and fish went along with

21

that, because what it is is a sovereign selling not only

22

the land, but their special rights in the land, and to

23

regulate the land, and to use it as they see fit.

conveying all of that.

They're

1

you have a conveyance of the land, that a reservation of

2

the right -- and the Court was very emphatic about this.

3

The Court said that the hunting and fishing right isn't a

4

grant to the Indians, but the Indians are granting the

5

land to the Government, or conveying the land to the

6

Government and preserving something.

Let me ask you a couple of things

that I'm curious about.

The petition -- the respondents

here got an award from the Indian Claims Commission --

11

MR. KIRWIN:

12

QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.
-- in 1970.

Did that have any effect

13

on the right to fish and hunt and gather wild rice?

14

the claim encompass any of that when they were

15

compensated?

16

MR. KIRWIN:

Did

Your Honor, in their final amended

17

petition or complaint before the Indian Claims Commission

18

the Indians had not mentioned hunting and fishing.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KIRWIN:

It was not mentioned.
Right.

They did mention it at

21

earlier stages and, in fact, before the court of claims,

22

which was the beginning of that process for them, they

23

specifically asserted that the privilege under the treaty

24

was temporary, and that the Federal Government had ended

25

it.

1

Now, they were not making that claim at the end

2

of the ICC proceeding, but I think an important thing

3

about the ICC proceeding is that the band's experts

4

proposed a value for the land based on its highest and

5

most valuable uses, and the ICC awarded the band an award

6

of an additional $9 million, about ten times as much as

7

the original payment, to compensate them for the entirety

8

of the land according to its highest, most valuable uses.

9

And this Court recognized in the Klamath case

10

that where an Indian band or tribe receives full

11

compensation without any deduction for hunting and fishing

12

rights, then presumptively that compensation includes the

13

hunting and fishing rights, too, that if there had been

14

reserved hunting and fishing rights, there should have

15

been a deduction for them, because the Indians were paid

16

as -- in Klamath as though they were conveying all their

17

Indian title to the land, which included hunting and

18

fishing rights.

19

QUESTION:

Was this the Fond du Lac Band that

20

had the case in the Indian Claims Commission, or the Mille

21

Lacs Band, or --

22

23

MR. KIRWIN:

Your Honor, by the end of the

proceeding it was all of the bands in this case.

24

QUESTION:

All of the bands.

25

QUESTION:

One other question.

It was odd that

1

there were subsequent treaties, one in 1854 and one in

2

1855, and they were different.

3

treaty rights for the Mille Lacs Band in 1855 treaty, but

4

it didn't do so with the other bands in the 1854 treaty.

5

Is there any explanation for that?

6

MR. KIRWIN:

The United States revoked

We don't know the explanation of

7

that for sure.

8

that they were negotiated by different people.

9

I think the most likely explanation is

The 1854 treaty was negotiated by an Indian

10

agent out in Wisconsin.

11

Commissioner Manypenny himself, and he had the Indians --

12

the Indian chiefs brought to Washington to negotiate with

13

him, and when you look at the 1854 treaty, as you point

14

out there was actually a grant of some hunting and -- a

15

reservation of some hunting and fishing rights in quite a

16

remote area of Minnesota.

17

The 1855 treaty was negotiated by

The whole approach of the treaty next year was

18

different, in 1855.

19

and fishing rights in the area ceded in that treaty, but

20

there was a catch-all provision under which the Indians

21

ceded any and all right, title, and interest of whatsoever

22

nature they may be, a sort of --

title
QUESTION:

2

And your argument was, land carries

3

with it the hunting and fishing rights.

4

I recall, the terms of the 1855 treaty were not that they

5

ceded every right, title, and interest of any sort

6

whatsoever.

7
8

They didn't -- as

That isn't the way it read, is it?

MR. KIRWIN:

It has the language in and to the

land.

9

QUESTION:
MR. KIRWIN:

10

Right.
Yes.

Yes, and as this Court

11

recognized in the Klamath case that the ordinary

12

construction of meaning, or of language like that is to

13

convey special hunting and fishing rights.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but the trouble is, the -- I

15

mean, we've got to judge ordinary construction in terms of

16

this treaty, and one of the problems that we have, it

17

seems to me, in seeing it your way, is just as was pointed

18

out earlier, at the time in question anyone could have

19

engaged in this sort of hunting and fishing.

the land and done it.

So it seems to me you've got at least a burden

24

to show that there was an understanding that hunting and

opposed to rights which any member of the public, without

2

any history of property ownership, could have exercised,

3

and I think that's where I have difficulty in seeing how

4

you make your argument.

5

MR. KIRWIN:

Your Honor, I agree that there's a

6

burden, but I think the burden goes the other way.

7

this Court recognized in Klamath, when you're dealing with

8

Indian relinquishment of rights and selling of land, the

9

context is different, and the understanding is that when

10

Indians sell all their right, title, and interest in and

11

to land, that unlike a private landowner, the Indians are

12

selling any special hunting and fishing rights they had.

13

As

And in the Klamath case and in the Yankton case,

14

this Court talked about the almost insurmountable

15

presumption that arises from such plain language.

16

agree that there's a burden, but we think the burden is on

17

the other side to show that the treaty meant something

18

other than what it seemed to say on its face.

MR. KIRWIN:

No, Your Honor.

Are you

That was the

7

situation at that time, but one way of looking at this is

8

that what was guaranteed to the Indians was that they

9

would be able to continue to do that, and that the Federal

10

Government or, more importantly, a territory or a State

11

wouldn't take that right away from them.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Kirwin, are you sure that

13

the Territory of Minnesota never had any hunting

regulations?
MR. KIRWIN:

15

that the Territory of Minnesota did, or Wisconsin.

19

MR. KIRWIN:

I believe that Wisconsin Territory

20

in 1837, which included this area and Minnesota Territory

21

later, did not include hunting and fishing regulations.

22

It was only when Minnesota became a State in 1858.

I'd like to know what your response is to the Solicitor

2

General's argument on what I think is the main point.

3

say that as President Taylor revoked the hunting and

4

fishing and gathering rights and also told them to remove,

5

and I take it you concede that the part that says remove

6

is unlawful.

MR. KIRWIN:

You

Your Honor, we have not argued this

in our brief, but we don't concede -QUESTION:

Well, anyway, you're not contesting

10

it, and in that case the question is severability, and I

11

just want to know -- I mean, as a matter of common sense

12

it's pretty hard to think that President Taylor, had he

13

known that they weren't going to remove, would have wanted

14

to have them sit there and starve.

15

I mean, there's no evidence of that, is there,

16

that anybody would want them to stay on their land and

17

starve, nor is there any evidence that they would have

18

used this to try to evict them, since the way to try to

19

evict them was to get them to go take their annuity 1,000

20

miles away, and that didn't work, so how would the other

21

have worked?

22

And then the SG's brief is just filled with

23

instances where the Government went and gave them rifles

24

and fishing gear and I guess maybe gathering equipment and

25

all kinds of stuff all the time, so when I read that, I

thought, well, gee, there's 100 years of everybody

2

thinking that they could fish and hunt and gather, and

3

what's the evidence that this would have been -- that

4

Zachary Taylor would have wanted the one to stay even

5

though the other fell?
MR. KIRWIN:

6

Your Honor, I'd like to make a

7

quick, two-part response to that.

One is that President

8

Taylor's purpose in doing that would very likely have been

9

what President Jackson said in 1829 when he was talking

10

about removal, and he said that the Indians must

11

understand that if they don't remove, they'll be subject

12

to the laws of the States, and Wisconsin had just become a

13

State in 1848, Minnesota had just become a Territory and

14

was soon to become a State, and so the President could

15

very well have wanted to clear the decks to allow those

16

States to engage in their normal State regulation.

17

And the second point is that, yes, the Federal

18

Government did allow the Indians to hunt on the land after

19

this time.

20

and so on to do this, but that doesn't indicate whether

21

they were intended to be hunting pursuant to State law or

22

not pursuant to State law and, in fact, the Federal

23

Government provided them with the same assistance in

24

hunting and fishing in the 1855 treaty area, where they

25

had no reserved hunting and fishing right, and so the fact

The Federal Government provided them equipment

1

that the Federal Government supported them in that simply

2

is no indication one way or the other on that point.

3

QUESTION:

It may be an indication that the

4

Federal Government understood that the 1855 treaty did not

5

convey any hunting and fishing rights.

6

MR. KIRWIN:

7

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor -I mean, we -- in terms of the

8

evidence, the evidence is equivocal.

9

don't see that it supports you clearly.

10

MR. KIRWIN:

It doesn't -- I

Your Honor, all I'm saying is, the

11

Federal Government providing them those materials doesn't

12

give any indication one way or the other on that point.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Kirwin.

Mr. Thompson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDY V. THOMPSON

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS JOHN W. THOMPSON, ET AL.

17
18
19

MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to address two issues, first, the

20

President's decision under the 1850 order and why it is

21

not reviewable and, secondly, why the Indian Claims

22

Commission operates as a jurisdictional bar in this case.

23

But briefly, before I begin, Justice Kennedy and

24

Justice O'Connor asked questions about whether or not

25

these were property interests, these hunting and fishing

1

privileges.
This Court made that clear, I believe, in

2

3

Klamath, and it had made it clear in Kennedy v. Becker,

4

which Klamath refers to, that a privilege to hunt and fish

5

is subject to State regulation, and it is in the nature of

6

a profit of prendre.

7

We, of course, have --

8

QUESTION:

Of what?

9

QUESTION:

Of profit of prendre?

10

MR. THOMPSON:

11

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

A profit of prendre.

But the question is whether it would

12

have been understood by the parties to this treaty at the

13

time as an interest in land.

14

I mean, we're construing treaty language, and

15

one of the difficulties, I think, that you have in

16

maintaining your position is, as we said earlier, that the

17

interest was an interest which could be exercised ad lib,

18

as it were, by anybody, given the state of regulation at

19

that time.

20

MR. THOMPSON:

I believe that the evidence

21

demonstrates that when the treaties were signed, because

22

they were land cession treaties, the language used was the

23

typical language of real estate conveyance.

24
25

If you look at the language of this treaty,
during the pleasure of the President, and the explanation

in the treaty journal that they will be allowed and

2

permitted during the President's pleasure to hunt and fish

3

upon the lands, that's precisely the language of a real

4

estate license.

I under --

QUESTION:

5

Well, may I just ask you -- I don't

6

want to cut you off, but that raises another point that I

7

want you to address.

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

Sure.

There was a considerable amount of

10

material in the briefs on the other side to the effect

11

that it is highly unlikely, almost to the point of

12

impossible, that the Indian parties to the treaty

13

understood the phrase, at the President's pleasure, in the

14

way that we would understand it as property lawyers today.

15

And specifically there was a fair amount of

16

information to the effect that the Indian parties to the

17

treaties specifically assumed that they would enjoy these

18

hunting and fishing rights as of right for a considerable

19

period of time, certainly beyond the point of the claimed

20

revocation, so in your answer, would you address that,

21

too?

22

MR. THOMPSON:

Certainly, and let me address

23

that first.

24

journal demonstrates that during the pleasure of the

25

President was, in fact, explained to the Indians.

I think that the language of the treaty

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It was referenced twice in the treaty journal,

1
2

and it was explained that they would be allowed and

3

permitted during his pleasure to hunt and fish upon the

4

land, and it would probably be many years before the Great

5

Father would want all of these lands for his white

6

Children.

7

Now, that's not a guarantee that it would be

8

many years, but it was an indication that neither party

9

was certain as to how quickly settlement pressures were

10

going to occur.
QUESTION:

11

But of course, the -- I suppose the

12

intransigence of the tribes at the time the removal order

13

came down, which ultimately the United States caved in to,

14

is probably some indication of what they thought the

15

period of time was that they were agreeing to.

16

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, I'm not certain that that's

17

the case, because we simply don't know what the bands were

18

thinking in 1837, other than what we have in the treaty.

19

QUESTION:

Well, we usually interpret treaties

20

by their language, don't we, I mean, just reading the

21

language?

22

MR. THOMPSON:

That's right.

That's right,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, and the plain language we believe

24

controls here, and that the -- there is no ambiguity, and

25

there was no finding of ambiguity in the language, during

2

the pleasure of the President.
QUESTION:

Well, there's at least this

3

ambiguity, does during the pleasure of the President mean

4

he only gets one shot at canceling it, or does it mean

5

whenever the President wants you to hunt and fish you may,

6

and whenever he doesn't, you may not?

7

MR. THOMPSON:

8

QUESTION:

Well --

In other words, was the -- assuming

9

that it was severable, was the presidential termination of

10

the hunting and fishing rights irrevocable, or could later

11

Presidents reinstitute the hunting and fishing rights?

12

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, we submit that while Taylor

13

probably could have suspended, given the power he had over

14

this privilege, he did not do so.

15

revoked it, we do not believe that the executive branch

16

had any authority to reinstate that privilege.

17

Congress could have, but the executive branch did not.

18

There's nothing in the treaty to suggest it.

19

He revoked it.

Once he

Certainly

I would refer the Court, for example, to the

20

language of the Federal Convention in which the term

21

maladministration was proposed as a term for, under the

22

impeachment article, and James Madison responded that such

23

a term would be tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.

24

I don't think James Madison was referring to the fact that

25

they could put the President in and out of office.

1

QUESTION:

But we do have also some notion that

2

we read these treaties in the light of knowing that the

3

party on the other side couldn't even speak the same

4

language, so the interpretation is more favorable than if

5

these were two sophisticated parties, meaning with equal

6

language facility, sophistication, isn't that so?

7

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, it is true, and I think

8

this Court addressed it specifically in Klamath, in which

9

the Court indicated that legal ambiguities are resolved in

10

favor of the Indians, and I believe they cited DeCoteau

11

for that proposition.

12

But the Court cannot ignore plain language,

13

viewed in the historical context and given the fair

14

appraisal, that runs counter to the band's claims.

15

QUESTION:

Is there any indication that the

16

tribes had -- since it's been stated that there was no

17

regulation, so nothing would have changed, revocation or

18

not, from 1850 until 1858, when this -- the introduction

of regulation.

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, I believe that the

presidential order was, in fact, communicated to the

5

Indians, and --

6

QUESTION:

You believe it based on what?

7

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, the evidence in the record

8

demonstrates that they received it.

After all, they even

9

sent a delegation to Washington in 1852 to lobby President

10

Fillmore to revoke the order, and were unsuccessful, so we

11

know that this was communicated to them, that the

12

President had issued his 1850 executive order.

13

Was I responsive to your question?

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes, but there was still no change in

actual circumstances, in what they could do.

16

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, remember, Justice Ginsburg,

17

we're on the edge of the American frontier, and very

18

difficult for, even if the United States had wanted to

19

enforce certain actions, to actually enforce hunting and

11

Turning to the 1850 order, I wanted to provide

12

our answer to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the

13

Indians were told and what they understood at the time the

14

1850 order was issued.

15

What the record shows is that they were told

16

that the order was an order to remove.

17

that the order was an order to stop hunting and fishing,

18

or would have any effect on hunting and fishing.

It was not sent, for example, to the Mille Lacs

that's what -- there was evidence to that effect.
In 1855, the Territorial Governor of Minnesota,

6

who was the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, he was the

7

highest Federal official responsible for implementing

8

Federal Indian law in the Territory of Minnesota, wrote a

9

letter and said that the Indians had no interest on these

lands except hunting and fishing.

11

recognized, 5 years after this order was issued, that they

12

had hunting and fishing rights under the 1837 treaty.

13

He specifically

There was an incident up at Mille Lacs Lake.

He

sent an investigator there, and the investigator reported

QUESTION:

In addition to revoking

Well, it was a two-part thing.

It

was the revocation of the rights and the removal order,

So as to the hunting and fishing,

MR. SLONIM:

would have been issued revoking the hunting and fishing

Right.
You know, your briefs seem to say

all, because they could continue to exercise the normal

been enough.

MR. SLONIM:

Can I address your point about

I'd like to talk about

Under the State's interpretation, the President

MR. SLONIM:

there's a process in

In this case we have a treaty that says there's

QUESTION:

Well, is it your position that in

fact the President -- and I didn't think it was, but I

want to be clear.
Is it your position that the President could not

if he had done it, as it were, with some just excuse and

unconnected with any invalid removal order at the time he

that they would be treated justly by the President and

that, of course, was a reflection of the provisions in the

Northwest ordinance, the trust responsibility as

articulated by this Court, and what we think that means in

The Chippewa retained the privilege under the

24

of the Minnesota territory ceded by that treaty.

the 1850 order stated that the Chippewa were required to

remove from the ceded territory and could no longer

2

exercise their usufructuary privilege there, that order

3

never took effect.
QUESTION:

4

What do you mean, the order never

5

took effect?

I mean, if it says the privileges shall last

6

as long as the -- at the pleasure of the President, and

7

the President says, it's no longer my pleasure, I revoke

8

it, that would seem to be self-executing.

9

MS. MCDOWELL:

10

I mean, what

If that was all that was in the

11

order, and if that was all that happened, we might agree

12

with you, but that's not the case.
It was part of an order that was designed for

13
14

the sole purpose, as the district court found, to remove

15

the Chippewa.
QUESTION:

16

Well, the district court finding is a

matter of law.

something more have to occur?
MS. MCDOWELL:

Because the President under a

3

treaty such as this one, that allows him to exercise his

4

pleasure with respect to the existence of these rights,

5

certainly has the ability to think about, as he is

6

carrying the policy into effect, whether in fact these

7

rights ought to be revoked, and it was clear as time went

8

on over the 2, 3, or 4-year period after the order was
issued, that the President, the executive and Congress did

10
11

not want the Chippewa to be removed.
QUESTION:

Well, President Taylor died in 1850,

12

the same year he revoked the order, so he didn't continue

13

to think about it for 4 years.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. MCDOWELL:

16
17

No, certainly not, but his

successors did.
QUESTION:

How about President Roosevelt's

18

letter in March of 1 38 recognizing that the thing had

1

been revoked?

20

How do you deal with that?

MS. MCDOWELL:

Well, as we explained in our

21

brief, Your Honor, that statement doesn't reflect any

22

consideration of the context in which the order was

issued, and what occurred afterward.

I'm amazed the Government would take such a

2

QUESTION:

Okay.

3

MS. MCDOWELL:

It would take an act of Congress

4

to reinstate the rights then.

5

QUESTION:

So then it must be the Government's

6

position that if you have what you might call an

7

irrevocable provision, no more hunting and fishing once he

8

says it can't be changed, and you attach that irrevocable

9

provision to a revocable one, namely, go, the President

10

can change his mind about go and say, oh, I changed my

11

mind, don't go.
When you attach an irrevocable one to a

12

13

revocable one, the irrevocable one becomes revocable.
MS. MCDOWELL:

14

Yes, in the context of what was

15

going on here, which was an order which was solely

16

designed for the purpose of removing the Chippewa, not for

17

revoking their usufructuary rights while they remained in

nonseverable, but the Government's taking the very strange

in effect to exercise his pleasure to end the rights, he

had to do it in an effective way, such that simply signing

3

a piece of paper saying, stop, is not enough?

4

Are you saying that he had to communicate it and

5

enforce it, and that that enforcement would in effect be

6

the communication to the people involved, that he did not

7

do that and he did not do that for the simple reason that

8

he could not enforce the other order, either?

9

Is that what it boils down to, that he never

10

really exercised his pleasure because he never carried it

11

through to the point of making it clear?

12

MS. MCDOWELL:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And you are not making the argument

14

that -- the legal argument that I thought the district

court bought, and the Eighth Circuit, too -- maybe I'm

16

wrong about that -- that the President could not, not that

17

he did not.

18

Here you're telling us he did not.

The

19

President could not order the removal because of an 1830

20

statute that says the Indians have to consent to a

21

removal.

by the lower courts, but you are not making that argument.

Is it not possible that a President

would think that the revocation should go forward so that

territorial or State government could regulate hunting and

fishing for all?
MS. MCDOWELL:

13

There's absolutely no evidence of

that in the record, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

But that is certainly possible, that

15

a President would think, yes, States or Territories, as

16

the case may be, should regulate hunting and fishing for

all.

18

MS. MCDOWELL:

That's possible, although that

19

would be a curious conclusion, because in the 1854 treaty

20

new usufructuary rights were recognized for the Indians

21

who were living in the 1854 ceded territory, the territory

22

that was newly ceded by that treaty.

so why did you in the brief twice, I noticed, you said,

that would be taking away their sustenance, but that's

wrong, isn't it?
MS. MCDOWELL:

16

We don't think that it's at all

clear that the Indians would have had, as one of the

Justices referred to, a white man's privilege to hunt and
