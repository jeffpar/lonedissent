ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. GLOGAU

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. GLOGAU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Patent and Plant Variety Remedy

13

Clarification Act of 1992 is unconstitutional because it

14

is not appropriate for remedial legislation under section

15

5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

16

When Congress considered this legislation, it

17

did not consider the right question, that is whether the

18

States have or will likely deny due process to patentees.

19

Rather, it only looked at the issue of whether the States

20

have or will infringe patents, not a constitutional wrong

21

in and of itself.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Glogau, what is it exactly

that was patented here?
MR. GLOGAU:

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, Justice Scalia, this -- this

10

case is here before us on a motion to dismiss and whether

11

or not --we certainly don't admit that we've infringed on

12

the patent.

13

dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity, that the -- the

14

act itself is unconstitutional because it -- the

15

underpinnings for section 5 legislation are missing here.

16

Our contention here is that on a motion to

Section 5 is remedial only.

This Court has been

17

very clear on that.

18

emphasized only remedial legislation can come under

19

section 5.

20

In City of Boerne, it was -- it was

The act here suffers, therefore, from the same

21

fatal defect that the act -- that the Religious Freedom

22

Restoration Act suffered from, and that is that neither

23

this Court nor Congress could have determined or did

24

determine that there has been or likely will be a

25

violation of the Constitution.

The mere infringement of a

really is all that the --my opponents here today will

argue I think, is not a constitutional wrong.

QUESTION:

If there is

What are the remedies in Florida for

patent infringement?
MR. GLOGAU:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
What are the State remedies in

Florida for patent infringement?
MR. GLOGAU:

In the Jacobs Wind case, Justice

13

Stevens, the petitioner in that case brought a patent

14

infringement case against the State of Florida in the

15

Federal court.

16

passed, said that the State had sovereign immunity.

17

petitioner -- the plaintiff in that case then went back to

18

the Florida State courts, and the Florida Supreme Court

19

said that in fact we will provide you with a remedy in

20

inverse condemnation or tort or -- or any number of -- of

21

various types of common law remedies.

22

The Federal circuit, before this act was

The petitioner -- the respondents in this case

cases that say that a patent is an equivalent for a patent

2

for land.

They say that it is personal property.
QUESTION:

have an answer to my question.

6

saying it's an inverse condemnation remedy?

MR. GLOGAU:

8

QUESTION:

9

My question is what is the

That's exactly correct.
That you have to prove you've taken

the whole patent.
MR. GLOGAU:

10

You have to prove that there's been

11

a taking.

In the context of patent infringement, the --

12

the issue -- the most important right found in a patent

13

property, as argued by my opponents here, is the right to

14

exclude use by other people.

15

QUESTION:

I suggest that --

Well, let me just simplify.

In the

16

whole history of Florida, has there ever been a State

17

judgment granting relief for patent infringement?
MR. GLOGAU:

18

I'm not aware that any case like

19

that has ever been brought, Your Honor, but clearly the

20

Florida Supreme Court said that that remedy is available.
QUESTION:

21

How many times has Florida infringed

22

patents as far as we know, and infringed them

intentionally, which I would assume would have to be a

24

condition for a taking?

Well, and indeed, the Federal

QUESTION:

Once you notify the alleged infringer

that the infringer is infringing on your patent, then one

10

can't -- and the infringer continues, one can't claim that

11

the action is unintentional at that point.

12

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, Your Honor, at that point you

13

go to patent counsel and get an opinion, and that's how

patent -- patent lawsuits progress.

QUESTION:

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, to the extent that the Tenth

are reserved to the States, I think the general power of

eminent domain would apply.

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, Your Honor, the basis --

extending that argument, the basis that Congress used to

that you or that anyone could reasonably find, including

Congress, that the implication of the Patent Clause is

courts because the very Congress that enacted the -- the

Is it your position that Congress does not

Congress?

13

Is that your position?
MR. GLOGAU:

Under -- under Article I, under the

Patent Clause, Congress can make that judgment for

everyone except the States because the Eleventh Amendment

16

prohibits them under Seminole Tribe.

So, the answer is when the States are

involved, Congress does not have the power by any means,

including section 5, to prescribe a scheme for uniformity

in the interpretation and litigation of patent law.

MR. GLOGAU:

That's correct because the States'

12

13

been on the books since Florida became a State.

14

I assume that's a

My hunch is that Florida, like States all over

the country, are engaging in more and more intellectual

activity that leads to patent situations where they apply

17

for patents or they possibly engage in activities that

might infringe patents.

going on in this area?
MR. GLOGAU:

Certainly it can't -- I would have

22

to concede that the States are engaging in activities that

23

are involved with intellectual property more today than

24

they were 100 years ago.

However, the fact that the State of Florida has

1

200 patents -- that's one side of the patent process, and

2

that does not imply -- I don't see any connection between

3

that and the fact that Florida will now all of a sudden be

4

accused of infringing 200 patents.

5

QUESTION:

No, of course not.

But the more that

6

any entity, a private business or a State or - - gets

7

involved in this kind of development where there are

8

arguments about invention infringement and so forth,

9

they're bound to be also questions of infringement arising

10

not necessarily deliberately but just that they're an

11

active participant in the intellectual marketplace where

12

all these problems arise.

13

And that seems to me quite -- quite wrong to

14

assume that the absence of a lot of litigation in the past

15

means that there's just no problem out there because your

16

view basically would say that States -- in fact, they

17

would motivate States to get involved in all sorts of

18

activity because they will always have one free shot.

19

Until somebody gets an injunction against infringement,

20

they can infringe and not have any worry about damage

21

liability.

22

MR. GLOGAU:

No, because if the State denies

I suggest that the State of Florida, the Supreme

Court of Florida has said to patentees who've claimed that

the State has infringed on their patents, we will give you

a meaningful remedy.

7

That being the case, our sovereign immunity

8

under the Eleventh Amendment simply can't be abrogated

9

because Congress may think that the State of West Virginia

10

doesn't provide due process, although of course, the

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN J. CULLIGAN

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT COLLEGE SAVINGS BANK

5
6

MR. CULLIGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

The constitutionality of Congress' enactment of

8

the Patent Remedy Act should be measured by the yardstick

9

the Court employed in Katzenbach against Morgan where the

10

Court looked to the classic formulation of the scope of

11

Congress' authority, articulated by Chief Justice Marshall

12

in McCulloch against Maryland.

13

if it's within the scope of the Constitution, then all

14

means that are appropriate and that are plainly adapted to

15

that end that are not prohibited but consistent with the

16

letter and the spirit of the Constitution are

17

constitutional.

18

If the end is legitimate,

In Morgan, the Court stated that section 5 of

19

the Fourteenth Amendment is correctly viewed as a positive

20

grant of legislative power that authorizes Congress to

21

exercise its discretion in determining whether and what

22

legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the

23

Fourteenth Amendment.

MR. CULLIGAN:

1

Yes.

In - - in its exposition of

2

the Katzenbach/Morgan standard, the Court explained that

3

the legislation that's the subject of the constitutional

4

challenge must not create or alter any rights and it -- it

5

must be proportional to the legitimate constitutional end

6

that it is designed to prevent.

7

The standard prescribed in Morgan was recently

8

echoed by the Court in Boerne where the Court observed

9

that it's for Congress in the first instance to determine

10

whether and what legislation is needed and that its

11

conclusions are entitled to much deference.
There should be no question here about the

12

13

legitimacy or the -- of the end or the objective that

14

underlies the enactment of the Patent Remedy act.

15

Congress enacted the Patent Remedy Act in 1992 to prevent

16

and deter the States from depriving patent owners of the

17

sum total of the property right that's secured by a

18

patent, the right to exclude all others, including the

19

States, and to provide a uniform set of procedures and

20

remedies - -

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

They have no power to do

22

that.

I mean, that objective -- you say there can be no

23

doubt about it, but there is doubt about it.

24

that's an Article I objective that you're now reciting,

25

and there is indeed, not only doubt.

So, I don't know what the limits of -- of

Congress's power to create property are.

4

in this case, with respect to patents, I know with respect

to copyrights, that Congress has the power to create that

property, and under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,

7

to protect them by abrogating the sovereign immunity of

the States when the States -- when there's a significant

likelihood that the States will deprive persons of that

that the power arises under the Patent Clause.

MR. CULLIGAN:

The power that arises under the

MR. CULLIGAN:

But the -- the very special

QUESTION:

The question of a remedy

Well, they may not have the right to

violation of that right is a constitutional violation.

18

And as I understand that State's position, it is that it

19

is only a constitutional violation where there is not only

a deprivation, but also a failure to provide adequate

compensation because that's the way the Fourteenth

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In this case, Congress heard testimony -- and

12

13

it's reflected in one hearing and -- and two -- two

14

reports, a House committee report and a Senate committee

15

report -- that in recent years State universities and

16

other instrumentalities have, to an unprecedented extent,

17

become active in commercial technology development; that

18

as a consequence, allegations of infringement by these

19

entities have risen and are projected to increase

20

dramatically; and that State laws, which vary widely, are

that the nature - - and I think this may be something that

-- I -- I -- as a non-patent lawyer, I wasn't aware of

the State is the same thing as the State actually reaching

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the -- the patent right is

13

defined by Congress as a result of the direction in the

14

Constitution that Congress secure the exclusive right for

inventors, and that's what the patent law provides.

16

gives the patent owner, for a limited period of time, a

right to exclude -- the exclusive use of this devise and

QUESTION:

And --

Well, General Waxman, certainly in

theory a State could provide adequate remedies for

10

violation and could, indeed, apply correctly Federal

11

patent law in doing so, could they not?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

I think it's not only true in

13

theory, Justice O'Connor, but if the Court reads McKesson

14

and Reich v. Collins and General Oil v. Crane the way I

15

read them, or at least the way I advocated in Alden v.

16

Maine, I think a good argument can be made that if

Congress provided no remedy at all, the States would be

required by the Constitution to provide an adequate post-

deprivation remedy.

Congress -- you know, when the Constitution was adopted by

the Framers, they put in the Patent and Copyright Clause,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. GLOGAU

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. GLOGAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

With all due respect to General Waxman, it seems

19

that they are taking an inconsistent position here.

In

20

their brief, on page 16 and 17, the United States cites to

21

several cases that say, for example, patents are property

22

and entitled to the same rights and sanctions as other

23

property.

24

States, the rights of a party under a patent are his

25

private property.

Again, for the --by the laws of the United

Similarly, College Savings Bank cites at page 20

1

2

of their -- of their brief, under the Court's holding in

3

Consolidated Fruit-Jar, a patent for an invention is as

4

much property as a patent for land, an uncompensated,

5

State-sponsored violation of a patent owner's right to

6

exclude also must constitute a taking.

7

After taking these positions, to assert that the

8

common law remedies available in the State courts for

9

takings torts or whatever are a violation of due process

10

just seems inconsistent to me.
In James v. Campbell -- it's a Federal case from

11
12

the late 1800's -- said in fact that the infringing of a

13

patent by the Federal Government is a taking.

14

again, to assert that the infringement by the State cannot

15

be remedied by an adequate State taking remedy is simply

16

inconsistent.

17

QUESTION:

So, once

Mr. Glogau, with respect to the

18

remedy, we heard a case, the Alden case from Maine, and

19

there one answer was the United States could always sue

20

because there is no Eleventh Amendment immunity in that

21

case.

22

that possibility for enforcement, is there?

23

But I take it in the patent picture, there isn't

MR. GLOGAU:

Oh, I disagree.

The way -- the way

24

the way the statute is written today, that is true, but

25

the statute could be written to give the United States the

I don't -- I don't see why

2

Congress couldn't write that.

3

QUESTION:

Well, there is -- there's an

4

administrative set-up in the Secretary of Labor to enforce

5

the Fair Labor Standards Act.

6

MR. GLOGAU:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So, there's -- but there's nothing

8

like that, as far as I know, for -- the Federal Government

9

has no agency that brings suits to enforce private

10

patents.
MR. GLOGAU:

11

But again, I agree.

The statute is

12

not written that way, but there certainly is a huge Patent

13

and Trademark Office out there by the airport, and they

14

employ a lot of people.

15

and give them enough money to enforce the patents.
