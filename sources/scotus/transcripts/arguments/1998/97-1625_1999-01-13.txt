ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER M. SFIKAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SFIKAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two issues in this case.

The first is

12

the question of whether or not the FTC Act has

13

jurisdiction over a nonprofit professional association,

14

and the second issue is whether or not the Commission and

15

the Ninth Circuit appropriately applied a quick look rule

16

of reason analysis to the facts in this case.

17

The jurisdictional dispute in this case is over

18

the interpretation of -- of the phrase in section 4 of the

19

FTC Act, which reads in its relevant part -- and this may

20

be found in the petitioner's brief at pages 1 and 2 -- a

21

company, trust, or association without shares of capital

22

or capital stock which is organized to carry on business

23

for its own profit or that of its members.

24

There is no disagreement on the record before

25

Your Honors that the CDA is a bona fide, not-for-profit

organized under California law, with a 501(c) (6)

tax exemption.

3

There are two major cases that discuss this

4

jurisdictional.

5

case and the second is the AMA case.

6

Federal

The first is the Community Blood Bank

In the Blood Bank case, both of the respondents

7

were not-for-profit associations.

After a full trial, the

8

FTC and the hearing officer found that they had violated
the antitrust laws by hindering the development of two

10
11

commercial blood banks.
On the jurisdictional issue, the hearing officer

12

who heard the case and the commission made specific

13

findings that there were benefits to members in these

14

cases, and that's how they rested their jurisdiction.

15

QUESTION:

Would just remind me, counsel?

16

the organization in the Blood Bank case -- was that a

17

501(c) (3) or (c) (6)?

18

MR. SFIKAS:

If the Court please,

Was

I've searched

the record and I come to the conclusion that the Kansas

20

City Area Hospital Association was not a 501(c) (3) .

21

QUESTION:

Do you recognize that there might be

22

some 501(c) (6) organizations that would fit the definition

23

of carries on business for the profit of its members?

24

MR. SFIKAS:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

Yes.

If you -- well,

I don't know

that I'm going to tell you that difference because I'm not

15

requires, however, that there be a profit, and profit was

16

defined in the Community Blood Bank case to be the excess

17

of revenue over expenses, with a contemplation that it is

QUESTION:

that the organization may provide to its members.
MR. SFIKAS:

12

QUESTION:

14

Well, I guess there are some

better insurance vehicles and other benefits

11

13

No such

benefits, though, for the dentists to belong to the Dental
Association:

10

So that -- and that's

Well -Do you say that the organization

provides no benefits to its members?
MR. SFIKAS:

Oh, no, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't

15

say that because the -- the membership dues for the

16

tripartite membership in dentistry is over $1,000, and I

17

think they get their -- their membership benefits.

18

But, Your Honor, as far as the California Dental

1

Association is concerned, nonmembers can get those same

20

services by paying a little more in the way of a fee.

21

There's nothing that the California Dental Association

22

does for dentists in the State of California that dentists

23

can't get elsewhere, and in fact, only 75 percent of the

24

dentists in the State are members of the California Dental

25

Association.

QUESTION:

Wasn't there a finding someplace that

2

the value of the membership to each dentist was worth -- I

3

don't know -- $20,000 or something?

4

MR. SFIKAS:

That was -- that was not a finding,

Your Honor.

at the way in which the books showed the -- the amount of

7

money that -- that the California Dental Association gets

8

largely from dues and how it was paid out.

percent for public service, and then there was 65 percent

I think what that was, was -- was a looking

There was 7

10

for membership.

11

promotion of the art and science of dentistry and high

12

professional standards, so it's not mutually exclusive.

13

In other words, in that 65 percent, there is the promotion

14

of the public interest.

15

But that membership includes the

QUESTION:

It's not mutually exclusive.

But I read section 44 to say an

16

organization which is organized to carry on business for

17

its own profit or for the profit of its members.

18

and in some sense the Dental Association does exist for

19

the benefit of the profit of its members.

20
21

MR. SFIKAS:

And --

Well, if the Court please, that

turns on the definition of profit.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SFIKAS:

Yes.
And the Community Blood Bank case

24

said that that's the excess of revenue over expenses,

25

either paid or contemplated to be paid.

And clear --

clearly here there has been no dividend paid, no

2

contemplation.
QUESTION:

3

No, but it says, or the profit of its

4

members.

It's true that the association isn't paying out

5

money, but it is in existence to help its dentists make

6

money and profit and be qualified professionals and -- and

7

succeed --

MR. SFIKAS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well --- in the business of -- the

profession of dentistry.
MR. SFIKAS:

11

If the Court -- well, no, Your

12

Honor, not in the -- not in the sense of the profit, the

13

way that term is defined in the Blood Bank case and in a

14

legion of cases that define the term profit, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

15

Well, those are lower court cases,

16

and I don't know that we've decided that.

17

approached this initially, I would have thought it was

18

designed to distinguish trade associations from charities.

19

This is -- yours is a trade association and the Blood Bank

20

is a charity.

So, as I

other respondent in the Community Blood Bank case was not

1

particular case.

I mean, if I looked at this and said,

2

look, it tries to distinguish trade associations from

3

charities, why am I wrong?

4

granted, there are some tough distinctions somewhere along

5

the line, but this wouldn't be one of them, I guess.
MR. SFIKAS:

6

Am I wrong?

And -- I --

With all due respect, Your Honor, I

7

would say that -- that you are wrong, that this is not a

8

trade association, that this is different than the Egg
Nutrition, for example, situation where clearly there was

10

a finding there with reference to the organization for its

11

profits.

12

argues in this case, as it did in the Blood Bank case and

13

as it did in the AMA case, is --

14

That was not a finding here.

QUESTION:

What the FTC

Well, let's take a trade organization

15

that unquestionably is a trade -- now, maybe milliners --

16

I don't know what it would be -- that wants to improve the

17

image of milliners or hatters in the public view.

18

doesn't make profit in the sense that you are describing,

1

but it does say, for example, if you join our

20

organization, then you will likely have $6,000 in

21

additional revenues, in other words, a 20 percent return

22

on the investment that you've made in paying us dues.

23

Suppose that was what the trade association said.

24

did public things and it did things for the -- for the

25

prestige of hatters and also was designed to help them

It

make money.

Would you say that the FTC had no authority

2

over such a trade organization?

3

MR. SFIKAS:

No, I would not, Your Honor,

4

because I think even though I think the statute is clear

5

on its face and you need not go to the legislative

6

history, if you go to the --

7

QUESTION:

8

But that wouldn't -- I gave you

something that deliberately does not have the narrow
definition of profit that you have been pressing.
MR. SFIKAS:

10

Yes, but it is a commercial

11

organization, and I think the phrase that we're talking

12

about says, organized to conduct business and to gain a

13

profit.

QUESTION:

14
15

I think that is doing business and -It says,

business for profit.

16

MR. SFIKAS:

QUESTION:

18

It doesn't say, and.

Correct.
Business for the profit.

MR. SFIKAS:

QUESTION:

Correct.
I don't know.

Were organizations

21

like the Cement Institute, the Sugar Institute, the Maple

22

Flooring Association -- were they themselves making

23

profit?

24

to make profit for their members.

25

I doubt it.

I had always thought they were there

look at the line of cases that the FTC relies on, in many

2

of those cases, the sole purpose of the organization was

to evade the antitrust laws.

clear that in those cases they were making a profit, and

If that were the case, I think you'd

say it would be covered.
MR. SFIKAS:

Well, Your Honor, you make another

13

point that I think is -- is very valuable, and that point

14

is that we're not asking for an exemption from the

15

antitrust laws.

and the Clayton Act.

Clearly we're subject to the Sherman Act

to have a limited statute for purposes of the FTC -QUESTION:

Well, except on that point, one of

20

the peculiar interests of the Federal Trade Commission is

21

advertising practices.

22

in advertising, you seem to me to be perhaps more in the

23

realm that is normally an FTC area of jurisdiction than

24

just the Sherman Act.

2

come to that, and I respectfully disagree.
QUESTION:

Are you going to answer Justice

3

Stevens' question?

Besides saying that -- that such an

4

organization for that price fixing would be subject to the

5

Sherman Act, will you answer his question of whether the

6

Federal Trade Commission would have jurisdiction --

7

MR. SFIKAS:

8

the facts of your hypothetical.

9

QUESTION:

Are you saying -- I -- I forgot all

The very simple fact that the trade

10

association, as some in our sorry history of antitrust

11

laws have in the past done, are engaged in price fixing.

12

They raise the level of the -- the fees that the dentists

13

charge generally by restricting advertising, recommending

14

fee rates, and doing a lot of things like that, which I'm

15

not suggesting your organization does.

16

dental association doing that, would it be covered?

17

MR. SFIKAS:

But a hypothetical

I would say there that there would

18

be a finding that it's organized for the profit of its

19

members and that -- that it would then probably be subject

20

to the antitrust laws.

one of its objects is -- is to make insurance cheaper?

That increases the profit.

The result is the same to the members.

MR. SFIKAS:

Well, I -- I think what we're

5

quarreling about here is the definition of profit.

does not meet the definition of profit.

8

QUESTION:

That

Well, the -- the -- in each case, the

profit I understand is to be defined by an increase in
what the dentists have at the end of the day.

And in

10

Justice Stevens' example, they get the increase by putting

11

the fee up.

12

client, they get it, if the association is doing its work,

13

by paying less for overhead.

14

In -- in the example, I think, of your

MR. SFIKAS:

What's the difference?

The difference is that Congress

15

spoke a certain way in framing this legislation.

16

the same Congress that also enacted the Clayton Act.

17

Clayton Act and the Sherman Act have very broad

18

definitions of who persons are, who corporations are.

Here clearly Congress meant something else.

This is
The

What was going on at this time when this act was

21

passed was the concern over the big trusts.

Congress was

22

not happy with the way in which the Sherman Act was being

23

prosecuted, Your Honor, and as a result, it wanted to

24

establish an agency, such as the Federal Trade Commission,

But I -- I take it at the end of --

jurisdictional significance.

MR. SFIKAS:

Is that the line you draw?

No, I -- because -- no.

No.

What I was saying was, as a

think the court would make the finding that they're

a number of classic cases.

I change one fact, and I don't know if I'm changing it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The provision conferring jurisdiction on the

6

7

commission, section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,

8

is set forth in full in the commission's opinion which is

9

on page 48a of the petition appendix, the light covered

10

document.

It's -- it's the latter part of this definition

11

that is pertinent here.
Section 4 uses expansive language in conferring

12

13

jurisdiction.

It extends the ordinary meaning of

14

corporation to include any organization associated --

15

organized to carry on business for its own profit or -- or

16

that of its members, even if it is unincorporated and even

17

if it lacks hallmarks of a profit-making enterprise, such

18

as shares of capital or capital stock or certificates of

interest.

So long as it is carrying on its activities for

embraces carrying on any activities.
MR. WALLACE:

2

Well, certainly in one sense, the

3

activities or an organization are its business.

the purposes for which it is organized and what it is

5

authorized to do under its certificate of incorporation.

6

It is hard to see what else is involved there.

8

QUESTION:

Those are

If you had a -- a not-for-profit

corporation of doctors that does nothing but meet once a
month to discuss innovations in surgery, that association

10

would be carrying on business in your definition of the

11

term here.

12

MR. WALLACE:

If -- if it were an organization

13

organized within the meaning of this act and -- and I

14

wouldn't hesitate to say that it would come within the

15

jurisdiction of the commission, although as you posed the

16

hypothetical, there would be no reason to think that

17

there's any violation of law.

18

But if they should add to that some deceptive

1

misrepresentations to the public in the form of paid

20

advertising, it's only section 5 of the Federal Trade

21

Commission Act that protects the public against that kind

22

of activity which is just as a small organization that

23

broke away from the Indiana Dental Association, the

24

Indiana Federation of Dentists, might have, in the three

engaged in deceptive practices that -- that should have

2

been of concern to the commission.
The mere fact that they're within the

3
4

jurisdiction of the agency doesn't mean that the agency is

5

going to prevent them from carrying on lawful activities,

6

but while petitioner says they're not exempt from the

antitrust laws, they are seeking an exemption from the --

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I -- I -- the commission's

own interpretation explains that in some detail as they

19

have formulated their interpretation, which is a

20

reasonable interpretation of -- of the language.

21

as the pecuniary benefit that they're engendering for

22

their members is a substantial part of the organization's

23

total activities rather than incidental to some

24

noncommercial activity, so they're not trying to reach

25

purely charitable organizations.

I was quoting the commission's

A problem counsel is often faced

with, yes.

(Laughter.)

6

MR. WALLACE:

And -- and -- I think the

7

commission was concerned principally with trying to avoid

8

charitable organizations which might incidentally engender

9

something of pecuniary benefit to member organizations

10

that use the blood and are charging for surgery and might,

11

for example, be said to be deriving some pecuniary

12

benefit.

13

But -- but I don't think this case is close to

14

the borderline of those definitional questions because

15

these are entrepreneurs engaged in profit-making business.

16

And it's quite clear from the legislative history that the

17

conference committee deliberately changed the statutory

18

text because they were warned that a trade association

19

could become the vehicle, as it was put in the legislative

20

history, for the imposition of horizontal trade restraints

21

among the competing members, which is exactly the problem

22

we're faced with here.

the commission's exercise of jurisdiction over trade

the jurisdiction extends that far.

2

In -- in -- in a very early court of appeals

3

decision, quoted on page 20 of our brief, the National

4

Harness Manufacturers against FTC case, the Sixth Circuit

5

in 1 20 picked up on the very point made in the

6

legislative history in saying that the language of the act

7

affords no support for the thought that individuals,

8

partnerships, and corporations can escape restraint under
the act from combining together in the use of unfair

10

methods of competition merely because they employ as a

11

medium an unincorporated, voluntary association without

12

capital and not itself engaged in commercial business.

13

And in footnote 12 of our brief, we cite three

14

examples from volume 1 of the Federal Trade Commission

15

Reports in 1 17 and 1 18 of trade associations that the

16

Federal Trade Commission took action against --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, am I right that in 1 17

18

and 1 18, Congress for the people generally were not

1

thinking about the professions as trades or businesses --

20

MR. WALLACE:

That certainly is the case, and

21

what I was leading up to is that then some of this Court's

22

leading decisions also involved trade associations not

involving the -- the learned professions, FTC against

two cases on the merits in this Court that -- that did

involve associations and the learned professions where it

was just assumed that they too fell within the

Mr. Wallace, if I -- if I assume the

jurisdictional question and say, yes, at one time we

10

didn't think of these things as trades, now we do.

But

11

still it's also a professional organization, and this is

12

its ethics guide.
Does the commission and the Court owe any

13
14

respect to the medical association, the dental association

15

when they say this is a matter of ethics, not business and

16

profit?

17

MR. WALLACE:

Well, they certainly owe respect

18

to any litigant before the commission to take seriously a

19

pro-competitive or other legitimate business justification

20

that the organization puts forward for a restraint that it

21

is imposing and to see whether that justifies a restraint

QUESTION:

I'm asking you specifically about

Are they different from people who make --

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think that this Court's

decisions in Goldfarb and Bates say that, for the most

part, this distinction has become an anachronism.

There

are many industries that affect the public where people

have a high degree of training in -- in supplying

foodstuffs for the consumption of the public and the like.

QUESTION:

Well, is it up to us or is it up to

anachronism?

clearly thought, when this statute was enacted, that

provision.

language which was understood not to include the

Commerce Clause extended that far.

any concern about that.

2

that was raised, but that's because the general assumption

3

has been that trade associations that operate for the

benefit, the pecuniary benefit, the profit, of their

5

members are covered by the Federal Trade Commission Act.

6

Of course, it wasn't an issue

Now, if I may turn to the merits.

The court of

appeals correctly applied -- and the commission here --

the rule of reason in accordance with this Court's modern

9

jurisprudence which approves a flexible inquiry under the

10

rule of reasons that is appropriate to the circumstances

11

of each case.

12

but it's very important to the merits, this Court

13

recognized in the Professional Engineers case that

14

agreements among members of a professional association

15

that govern the way those members compete with one another

are horizontal restraints of trade.

17

As I said in connection with jurisdiction,

QUESTION:

Isn't that consistent with the

petitioner's argument that the way we can tell that an

abbreviated analysis is necessary is by looking at the

kind of restraint and that is very close to a per se rule?

21

Isn't he right about that?

away from proliferation of categories in modern antitrust

They're not intuitively sound.

MR. WALLACE:

All of the findings by the

commission in this case -- and they are -- are numerous --

11

are -- are based on a detailed record that was compiled

12

through extensive discovery, followed by a 2-week trial.

13

And the central thing in the record is an

14

analysis of petitioner's challenges to advertisements by

15

393 dentists from 1982 to 1993 that showed the nature of

16

the restraints being imposed.

17

Then there was testimony, both --

What the commission significantly

didn't find and what the court of appeals didn't find was

20

that dentists are more -- are -- are willing to -- to be

constrained in their advertising rather than resign from

It seems to me that if you want to establish

1

2

that something is happening in the market to restrain

3

competition, it is the opposite that has to be proved by

4

the Government, namely that dentists would rather forego

advertising than be bounced out of this association.

that's never established anywhere.

acknowledges it.

It's sort of an intermediate per se rule where

studies that were followed, the applicant for membership

This was --

Are you aware --

5

MR. WALLACE:

-- a survey of 393 examples in

6

which the commission imposed discipline on advertising --

7

which the -- the petitioner imposed discipline on

8

advertising.

9

studies did the dentists choose to stay with the ads and

And in no instance of all of those case

10

give up membership because membership has many values that

11

the petitioner has touted and that we summarize on pages 2

12

and 3 of our brief, including a finding that Justice

13

Kennedy referred to earlier by the commission that

14

petitioner -- the petitioner -- represented the value to

15

be anywhere from $22,000 to $65,000 a year to members,

16

depending on the array of services that they chose to call

17

upon.

18

So, we do have findings of harm to competition

19

from the particular restraints, and the fact that they
