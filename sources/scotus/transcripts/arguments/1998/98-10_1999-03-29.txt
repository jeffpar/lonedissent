CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

v. William Acker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M. SEWELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SEWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I want to speak to you first this morning about

11
12

the jurisdiction issues in this case.

13

the question of how, not whether, but how the Tax

14

Injunction Act applies to a tax collection case removed to

15

Federal court.

16

is interpreted and applied as a broad jurisdictional

17

barrier or simply as a limitation on a court's remedial

18

power.

19

broadly to keep collection cases out of Federal court

20

altogether because any lesser approach, any more narrow

21

approach is just -- is unworkable.

22

This case presents

That, in turn, depends on whether the act

We say that the -- the act should be applied

QUESTION:

Well, in this case, Mr. Sewell, the

23

-- the county brought the action in State court, didn't

24

it, to collect the taxes?

25

MR. SEWELL:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

1

2

And then the defendants -- the judges

removed it to Federal court.

3

MR. SEWELL:

4

QUESTION:

That's right.
And so, it -- you say at that point

5

the Tax Injunction Act applied to prevent the State from

6

-- from collecting a tax?

7

MR. SEWELL:

I say that the Tax Injunction Act

8

ought to apply to a tax collection case whether it's

9

removed by a defendant by a taxpayer to Federal court or

10

whether we had brought the case ourself in Federal court.

11

I think the Tax Injunction Act should bar -- should keep

12

these cases out of Federal court for a number of reasons.

13

The --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SEWELL:

Go ahead.
The reason is, is because if you

16

have some lesser approach, it's just not workable.

17

Tax Injunction Act is going to apply in some form or

18

fashion if a case is removed, a collection case is

19

removed.

20

in a tax collection case, the -- it seems to me that that

21

would allow the taxing authority, me in this case, the

22

government, to use the Tax Injunction Act as both a sword

23

and a shield to whipsaw a taxpayer.

24
25

The

For -- for example, if you go into Federal court

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what if this action had

been brought in State court to collect taxes on the basis,

say, of diversity of citizenship, and it was removed on

2

that basis to the Federal court and there was no claim

that the tax was unconstitutional?

Maybe there was just a

You think the Tax Injunction Act would

MR. SEWELL:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

I believe

-- and I look to footnote 22 partially of the Grace
Brethren Church opinion.
QUESTION:

10
11

to look for controlling law.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. SEWELL:

14

Well, that's not the greatest place

I thought it was a good place to

look.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. SEWELL:

And -- and when I went back and

17

read that footnote, that footnote gives a very thorough

18

history and analysis of the Tax Injunction Act, and it

1

quotes the Senators and the Members of Congress that were

20

responsible for enacting that act.

21

demonstrates -- demonstrated to me conclusively that the

22

purpose of the Tax Injunction Act, the central purpose,

23

was to keep a Federal court from interfering in any manner

24

in a State tax if there's an adequate State remedy.

25

seems to me to be the -- the clear purpose.

And that footnote

QUESTION:

1

Well, then why didn't the act simply

2

say the Federal courts have no jurisdiction in State tax

3

cases?

4

MR. SEWELL:

I think that the act -- I wish that

5

the act had -- had said that, and I think that that's --

6

you know, the act talks in terms of Federal courts not

7

having the jurisdiction to -- to enjoin, suspend or

8

restrain a levy, assessment, or collection of a State tax.

9

But, in effect, Your Honor, that's what happened here.

10

QUESTION:

I don't understand that because the

11

-- the suit didn't change its shape from being a suit to

12

collect, not a suit to enjoin, but a suit to collect.

13

That's what it was.

14

MR. SEWELL:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That's right.
And that was what was removed, and it

remains a suit to collect.
MR. SEWELL:

It does, and the -- I'm assuming

18

that the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act, the

19

overreaching purpose, is to prevent a Federal court from

20

interfering with the collection or the administration of

21

State tax, and I believe that's what the Court's Grace

22

Brethren Church opinion, specifically footnote 22 --

23

that's exactly what it said.

24
25

Now, the -- the way I see this, the -- in this
case, the Federal court did interfere with the collection,

In this case -- this case has

stopped us from collecting the tax not only from the

respondents, but from all the Federal judges in the

MR. SEWELL:

It's the

I think that there would --we may

18

have some -- some of the same results, but I think again

19

the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act is to keep the

20

Federal court from doing that.

21

QUESTION:

But the purpose of diversity

22

jurisdiction is to provide a -- basically a more neutral

23

forum perhaps than the State court but to resolve the case

24

in exactly the same way that the State court would have

25

resolved it.

So, if -- if there had been a decision of

the part of Federal employees?

MR. SEWELL:

I think that you may have some of

the same results and you may have some of the same

6

displeasure from the Federal employees, certainly.

Certainly.

would we be enjoining a State tax?

Well, Your Honor, I think that -Under your analysis, we would I

1

-- namely, to give a judgment against a person who is

2

resisting the collection of a State tax -- we would be

3

violating the Anti-Injunction Act.
MR. SEWELL:

4

I think that your jurisdictional -

5

- and I understand your point and you're correct, but your

-- your basis for an appellate review of a State court

7

decision is different from what I'm suggesting to you.

I'm talking about jurisdiction at the trial level, the

initial Federal jurisdiction.

I wondered if you wanted to

Yes, ma'am.

I had planned to argue

that.
We feel that under 1442 that -- that neither

20

test is met because refusing to pay taxes is not an act

21

done under the color of a judge's office, and it's not

22

done in the performance of any judicial duty.

23

no Federal statute, I know of no act of Congress that --

that instructs a judge to not pay his or her taxes.

pretty much tied up with the merits of whether the tax can

be imposed.
MR. SEWELL:

3

I think that -- that perhaps it is,

4

and I certainly -- and I don't suggest to you that -- that

5

-- that the judge would have to win on the merits to -- to

6

have jurisdiction.

7

there has to be something colorable about the defense

8

that's pled, and to me if -- if -- if the people in Mesa

v. California couldn't convince the Court that -- that

But I -- I do suggest to you that

10

when they ran over somebody in their -- in their postal

11

buggies that they were engaged in their official function,

12

I don't see how not paying a tax would satisfy that.

13

Certainly if these judges didn't pay Alabama's income

QUESTION:

But -- but this tax says that it's

16

unlawful to perform the function, i.e., it's unlawful to

17

be a judge if you don't pay the tax.

18

MR. SEWELL:

No, sir.

I disagree with that.

19

The tax -- the ordinance says that it's unlawful to work

20

in the county without paying the tax.

21

appeals seized on that language, but that -- what they

22

failed to do -- they failed to do two things.

23

those things was they failed to recognize the difference

is what ours is, which stems from our taxing power, versus

MR. SEWELL:

-- that a -- that a license -I must not have written that.

QUESTION:

11

And why -- why is it -- I mean, this

-- why is it basically an income tax?
MR. SEWELL:

12

Because the Buck Act makes it an

13

income tax.

Congress -- Congress converted all State and

14

local license taxes to be income taxes under Federal law.
QUESTION:

Okay, I'm with you, and I don't --

QUESTION:

But assuming that's true, why -- how

then do you get around Davis against Michigan?

7

MR. SEWELL:

Because I read Davis v. Michigan as

8

-- as the problem with that tax was that it discriminated

9

against Federal employees by favoring State employees --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SEWELL:

Right.
-- because of the source of the

12

compensation, which is what the Public Salary Tax Act

13

says.

14

There may be other forms of factual discrimination.
QUESTION:

That wasn't the basis, though, of the

Eleventh Circuit's decision here, was it, that it

discriminated?

17

MR. SEWELL:

The Eleventh Circuit said -- noted

18

that the trial court found that the tax did not

19

discriminate and went on to say the judges didn't appeal

20

it, and so they were not going to address it.

21

QUESTION:

And is it true, Mr. Sewell -- Mr.

22

Sewell, is it true that this tax would apply to State

3

Justice Stone said for this Court in Matthews v. Rodgers,

4

which is cited in the legislative history of the Tax

5

Injunction Act, although injunctions against State taxes

6

should not be heard in Federal courts, Federal courts

7

remain competent to decide questions of State law, and

8

therefore can adjudicate collection and refund cases

9

brought in Federal court so long as the essential elements

of Federal jurisdiction are present.

11

It's our position that in this case, the

12

essential elements of Federal jurisdiction are not

13

present.

14

is the Federal removal statute which does not apply here

15

because the action of the judge in refusing to pay a tax

16

on his private income is not an act taken under color of

17

authority or pursuant to his duties as a Federal officer.

The only asserted basis for Federal jurisdiction

In the removal petition, respondents incorrectly

18
19

stated that the tax was imposed on the act of performing

20

their official duties.

or should be prevented from performing his official

functions, then the judge could remove the case and say

that what's at issue is my official acts, whether I can

QUESTION:

If there were a case brought in

Well, here the judges I suppose could

of the case that was brought was simply a -- a predicate

to what could have been an injunction against their

MR. JONES:

Do you have any thoughts on the

MR. JONES:

That's what I was kind of working on

there, Justice Scalia.
(Laughter.)
MR. JONES:

The only other thought I have on the

merits is that their contention that discrimination

10

prohibits this tax is simply wrong.

11

the kind of discrimination the Public Salary Tax Act

12

prohibits is discrimination based on the sovereignty of

13

the employees.

14

discrimination involved in Davis v. Michigan where State

15

workers were treated better than Federal workers.

16

this tax scheme, it appears that regardless of whether

17

you're a Federal worker, a State worker, a private worker,

18

the tax applies the same way to you.

19

In Davis v. Michigan,

This is not like the pension

Under

It's true that there are exemptions in the State

20

-- in the county tax provision for undertakers and

objections is to avoid a double tax on these previously

They apply

2

equally and this case does not present any question about

3

equal protection issues whether these kinds of

4

discriminations satisfy the rational basis standard

5

because those issues weren't raised below.
The only discrimination issue involved under the

6

7

Buck Act is -- under the Public Salary Tax Act is whether

8

the statute discriminates because these are Federal
workers, and the answer to that is not.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Jones, if we should agree with

11

you about that issue on the merits, what about the issue

12

that the Eleventh Circuit didn't decide and that is the

13

diminution of compensation?

14

MR. JONES:

Would we --

Well, the O'Malley v. Woodrough, the

15

Court held that -- that a tax on the incomes of Federal

16

judges would not be a diminishment of their compensation

17

for Article III purposes.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, I don't think the tax in

1

Michigan discriminated against the Federal workers because

20

they were Federal workers.

21

every other citizen in the State, discriminated in favor

22

of a very small group of State workers.

division of the State court of Alabama by the respondents,

two Article III Federal judges, and they alleged in their

removal petition that the provision that the -- both the

5

Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter focused on about the

6

unlawful -- making it unlawful to engage in the occupation

7

was tantamount to an imposition of a licensing requirement

8

by the county upon Federal judges, which if carried out,

9

would interfere with their Federal -- carrying on the

10

duties of Federal judges.

For purposes of removal, that

11

is clearly a kind of Federal immunity defense, saying that

the Constitution does not allow Jefferson County to do

that.
If ultimately we are wrong on the merits -- and

Well, let me -

I -- I just don't know how to get

around that.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, let me -- let me begin with

Howard since it has taken up some attention.
The first thing I think we ought to recognize is

8

that the Howard ordinance, insofar as it was before the

9

Court, was only -- the single footnote in note 2 in the

10

Howard opinion quotes all of the ordinance that was

11

actually in this Court.

12

joint appendix, and there is nothing about exemptions in

13

the Howard ordinance at all.

14

was aware, and despite whatever may have been the actual

15

state of the law at the time in terms of Louisville

16

ordinance, there were no exemptions.

I have gone and looked at the

So that insofar as the Court

17

It now appears -- and there has been several

18

rounds of submissions on this, but it appears that the

19

Louisville ordinance in effect at that time did have three

20

exemptions.

21

One for domestic servants and the ordinance

22

specifically says with respect to that that the -- the

23

exemption is because of the great costs of administration

24

and difficulty of collection involved, domestic servants

25

are excluded.

Second, there is an exclusion for ministers.

1

I

2

don't want to get into another constitutional issue here

3

today, but whatever that exclusion is and the questionable

4

nature of it under First Amendment law, it was not a broad

5

exclusion.

6

The other exclusion was for insurance companies

7

who had other taxes, and there was another provision that

8

said other businesses that had licenses.

9

their licenses, but they still had to pay the tax under

They didn't lose

the ordinance.

11

Stated another way, instead of the 140

12

exemptions across a broad range of issues that we have in

13

this statutory scheme here, we had a very narrow set of

14

exemptions, one for obvious administrative convenience

15

reasons.

16

QUESTION:

Well, I think your problem isn't so

17

much the Howard case as the definition in the Buck Act

18

that says an income tax is any tax levied on, respect to,

19

or measured by net income, gross income, or gross

20

receipts, which the Court was simply interpreting in

21

Howard.

22

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I want to be clear.

The

23

fact that this is not an income tax like the Federal

income tax is not the reason that we say that this is not

a tax covered by -- by the statute.

The Buck Act is principally a

provision to remove the possibility that someone would

QUESTION:

Well, whatever it may be principally,

do you dispute the fact that this -- this tax was measured

8

MR. MORRISON:

9

QUESTION:

10

I do not, Your Honor.

Then why -- why doesn't the Buck Act

MR. MORRISON:

11

The Buck Act is not an enabling

12

provision.

The Public Salary Tax Act is an enabling

13

provision.

The Buck Act, which was passed 2 years

14

subsequent to that, was a provision intended to close a

15

possible loophole.

16

in this -- in the case of Louisville, the ordinance there

17

was physically within the confines of the City of

18

Louisville.

19

owned by the United States, and the concern was that

20

someone would say, as someone did in that case -- and that

21

was the principal focus of the issue.

22

-- the United States Government has right to the property

23

and therefore no locality may impose the tax.

It was actually -- the property was actually

In that case, the

think I would put it this way.

it hard to understand how there can be an income tax under

But under the Buck Act, a sales tax

MR. MORRISON:

A gross -- a gross receipts tax.

For instance, the court reporter in the City of Pittsburgh

9

that the transcripts that were sold to the public are

properly taxable under the Public Salary Tax Act, and

that's in large part because it's not a licensing scheme

in any way and also because there are no exemptions for

no arguable discrimination.

In any event, we -- we are confident that the

MR. MORRISON:
