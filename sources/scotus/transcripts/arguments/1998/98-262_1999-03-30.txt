CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CASEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Congress intended the PLRA attorney's fee cap to

11
12

apply to cases precisely like the two before the Court

13

this morning.

14

frivolous claims in cases and to limit Federal court

15

involvement in the details of State prison management, but

16

it also intended to relieve States of some of the

17

financial burden of such cases and, in particular, some of

18

the financial burden of attorney's fees ancillary to such

19

cases.

20

Congress intended not only to limit

42 U.S.C. 1988 provides that a district court

21

may allow reasonable fees to prevailing parties.

22

PLRA, in effect, has defined prevailing party and

23

reasonable fee.

24
25

QUESTION:

The

Mr. Casey, some of the fees in this

case are not -- reasonable fees to prevailing party.

been expended in the course of the litigation before the

judgment.

But some of these fees were for the purpose of

MR. CASEY:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.
The attorneys' efforts undertaken in

7

-- do the courts have the power to do that, to sort of

8

hire, you know, a private marshals force to -- to see that

9

their injunctions are being complied with?

10

common practice?

I frankly was unaware of it.

MR. CASEY:

11

Is this a

My understanding is that it is a

12

common practice.

13

after trial has been entered, the district court

14

frequently retains jurisdiction to monitor compliance.

15

Remedial orders are entered, and the court monitors

16

compliance.

-- who pays for it?

22

MR. CASEY;

QUESTION:

24

MR. CASEY;

but

That's --

The State pays for it.
Why is that?
The court has in one case determined

there has been constitutional violations sufficient to

2

require the defendant to make -- to rectify the

3

constitutional violations.

4

In this case --

5

QUESTION:

Well, that's fine.

And if they

6

should -- if they should commit the violation again and

7

you should sue again, then I assume the attorney's fees

expended in demonstrating that they continued the

9

violation would be fees expended by the prevailing party

in that later litigation.

MR. CASEY:

QUESTION:

16

But once litigation has been

Your Honor --- that you can hire attorneys to --

to oversee the -- the prisons for -- for the court.
MR. CASEY:

The States have objected loudly and

17

long against that practice, and now in the PLRA, Congress

18

has directed its attention to it.

19

QUESTION:

And in --

Well, that -- that feature colors my

20

whole view of this case, and I'm -- I'm worried that --

21

that how I come out in this case is -- is going to be

22

dependent on a -- on a practice that I'm not sure is even

23

-- is even authorized.

24

challenge to that here I gather.

25

MR. CASEY:

But there's -- there's no

Not in this case, no.

QUESTION:

1

Would you give us a little more

2

background?

There are two cases here:

3

actions I take it, one involving female prisoners and one

4

male prisoners?

5

MR. CASEY:

6

QUESTION:

one in class

That's correct.
In both cases is there still an

7

ongoing monitoring or has one of them been concluded at

8

last?
MR. CASEY:

We filed a supplemental brief a few

10

weeks ago, Your Honor.

11

or so the circuit court remanded the case to the district

12

court with instructions to make findings as to whether

13

there are current violations.

14

made those findings, has found that there are no current

15

violations, and has terminated its jurisdiction.

16

Sixth Circuit had retained jurisdiction, so now briefs are

17

scheduled to be filed.

18

QUESTION:

In the Glover case, 6 months ago

The district court has now

Well, now on -- on that one, do we

1

have an issue remaining as to attorney's fees for

20

monitoring in the Glover case --

21

MR. CASEY:

QUESTION:

-- post PLRA and until the

termination of the suit?
MR. CASEY:

Yes.

I believe that termination of

the suit does not moot out the current attorney fee

requests.
QUESTION:

2

3

where there is still an ongoing monitoring?

4

MR. CASEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

And -- and the Hadix suit is one

Yes.
And there's been no petition to end

that one?
MR. CASEY:

7

There have been.

We have

8

unsuccessfully appealed portions of it.

The case most

9

recently was remanded from the Sixth Circuit back to the

10

district court for further proceedings to determine

11

whether there are current constitutional violations.
QUESTION:

12

Now, one other housekeeping sort of

13

question.

Has the State paid all the fees to the

14

attorneys for monitoring up to the effective date of the

15

PLRA?
MR. CASEY:

16

The mechanism for attorney's fees in

17

these cases was that each 6 months the plaintiffs'

18

attorneys would submit a request for attorney's fees.

19

would make objections, as we saw appropriate, and then the

20

district court would enter an order.
QUESTION:

question.

Well,

We

So --

I asked a pretty simple

I -- I thought PLRA became effective April

1996.

Is that right?

That's correct.
Has the State paid the attorney's

fees up to that date?
MR. CASEY:

2

There is a period of 4 months where

3

we are challenging.

4

1996, and we are asserting that the determinative date

5

under the PLRA is the date of the award.

6

that is at issue is for the 6 months starting December of

7

1996.

8

So, we have in Michigan -QUESTION:

10

11

MR. CASEY:

So, the answer is that the State has

That's correct.

QUESTION:

14

MR. CASEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

two cases has been going on?
MR. CASEY:

17

19
20
21

We have not paid

the entire fee.

18

And the cycle

The PLRA took effect, as you say, in April of 1996.

The fee cycle started January 1 of

Up to the effective date.
Correct.
Would you tell how long each of these

One was filed in 1977 and the other

in 1980.
QUESTION:

So, they were cash cows, in effect,

weren't they?
MR. CASEY:

They were, indeed, Your Honor, and

22

the Sixth Circuit stated that in one of its opinions,

23

which we've quoted in the brief.

24
25

QUESTION:

Particularly since --

Well, the record before us of the

extent of the violations of the injunction -- we don't

consistent violations and the monitoring was necessary so

3

that the officials would abide by the court's orders.

4

It may be that these -- that there were

So, but that's -- the sole issue here is how

5

much per hour, as I understand it, and not whether these

6

injunctive decrees were needed.

7
8

MR. CASEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

As --

as the case is postured now, we are only dealing with the
attorney fee cap in section 803(d)(3) of the PLRA.
QUESTION:

10

May I ask just one other question?

11

Your -- your position is that the date of the award

12

governs.

13

was passed, but you challenged it and appealed it, and

14

then it became final after the statute was passed, how

15

would you deal with that?

16

Supposing there's an award before the statute

MR. CASEY:

For an award which has not been

17

liquidated and finalized, we believe that the PLRA would

18

apply.

QUESTION:

20

MR. CASEY:

21

I see.
We -- we are not seeking to reopen

old - -

22

QUESTION:

I understand that, but I just --

23

QUESTION:

Is there any -- I mean, the common

24

sense of this I guess would be Congress passes a statute

25

saying put a cap on rates.

All right?

1

MR. CASEY:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
Somebody who knew nothing about it

3

would say, I guess they mean that the cap applies to

4

people for future work, and it doesn't apply for past

5

work.

6

that's what I would say.

All right.

Now, why is it knowing a lot about it, I'd have

7

to say something else?
(Laughter.)

Well, some of this is future work.

Oh, yes.
-- lest it be thought the -Some of it is -I mean, I assume you're not going to

object to that part of it, but the -- the common sense -what I think is the common sense of it.

And the other

part -MR. CASEY:

19

Well, as -- as this Court has told

20

us in Landgraf, you first look to see if Congress has made

21

a clear statement about its intention, and to do that, you

22

first look at the text of the statute and the legislative

23

history.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the statute here doesn't say

anything about what is supposed to happen.

It just says

1

there is this cap on attorney's fees, and we know it

2

became effective in April of 1996.

3

That's all we know from looking at the statute.

4

MR. CASEY:

Isn't that right?

We believe that the text of the

5

statute does clearly show Congress' intent that it apply

6

to pending cases.

7

action brought by a prisoner who is confined.

8

words of the present tense.

9

pending cases.

Section 803(d)(1) refers to in any
Those are

We believe they apply to

10

In Hutto v. Finney, this Court said of similar

11

language in section 1988 that the words any action could

12

not be broader and contained no hint of an exception.

13
14

QUESTION:

Of course, the word brought was not

in that statute.

15

MR. CASEY:

That's correct.

16

We are not saying that any individual word here

17

by itself is determinative.

18

must look at the entire statute.

19

subsections:

20

803(d)(3), which says no award of attorney fees shall be

21

greater than 100 percent.

22

encompassing words.

23

To determine the intent, you
There are three

the one I've just read and also section

Again, these are all

No award we say means no award.

Thirdly, the definition of prisoner in section

24

8038 says any person incarcerated who is convicted or

25

sentenced for.

Again, words in the present tense which

1

are all-encompassing and contain no exception and no

2

limitation to solely prospective application.
QUESTION:

3

And yet, there is another section

4

that does state it is to be retrospectively applicable,

5

and this section that we're dealing with conspicuously

6

does not contain any such explicit instruction.
MR. CASEY:

7

Section 802 of the PLRA was an

8

amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.

9

3626.

In that section, the -- there is an explicit

10

statement that section 802 applies to pending cases.

11

believe that Congress knew after this Court's opinion in

12

Landgraf that in order to make that section apply to

13

pending cases, they had to do it explicitly because that

14

was a substantive section.

15

which plaintiffs would be entitled and to terminating

16

current relief.

17

We

It applied to the relief to

The sections that we are talking about,

18

particularly section 803(d), we submit is more of a

19

procedural than a substantive section.

20

sections of the PLRA, except section 802, are sort of a

21

grab bag of different kinds of statutes.

22

such things as filing fees, exhaustion of administrative

23

remedies.

2

principle you're espousing, that all procedural things -I don't understand.

The line between retroactivity and

3

non-retroactivity or between a presumption of

4

retroactivity and a non-presumption of retroactivity is

5

the same as the line between substance and procedure?
MR. CASEY:

6

7

That is one of the factors the Court

identified in Landgraf.
QUESTION:

8

I thought that -- that the

distinctive feature of 802(b)(1) is the fact that it says
10

it shall apply with respect to all prospective relief

11

whether such relief was originally granted or approved

12

before, on, or after the date of enactment of this title.

13

I mean, that -- that is a degree of retroactivity,

14

admitted retroactivity.

15

retroactivity here, are you?

16

this applies before.

MR. CASEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

That's correct.
That is, it applied to matters before

the date of enactment of this title.

4

MR. CASEY:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.
You don't assert that 803 applies to

6

matters before the date of this title.

7

just assert that it applies to all fees awarded.
MR. CASEY:

8

9

You just -- you

We say it applies to all awards made

after the effect of the statute.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

QUESTION:

But it does apply to awards made for

12

work done before the date of the statute.
MR. CASEY:

13
14
15

That is our contention, yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Let's assume, for the sake of

16

argument, that I don't think the -- the text really

17

answers the question so that we have to go to step two in

18

-- in the retroactivity analysis and ask sort of the

19

Justice Story questions which in this case I guess would

20

be the question whether the act imposes a disability with

21

respect to completed acts as of the date of its enactment.

22

And I take it in this case that would translate into the

23

question whether the -- whether the act in effect

24

interferes with the -- sort of the -- the fee agreement or

25

the -- the terms of the fee that had been set before the

date of the act.
Now, my -- my question I guess is this.

2

Is it

3

-- is it your argument that the -- as it were, the

4

expectations for payment of fee,

5

simply a fee which in the terms of 1988 was a reasonable

6

fee, whatever that might turn out to be,

7

applies?

18

they began their work, and certainly at all -- at the time

19

that they did the work up until at least the effective

20

date -- forget the later period -- their -- their

expectation was that they would be paid on whatever the -

22

- sort of the going rate was at that time, which was the

were that they would be paid at that higher amount?

And therefore, it's

Why isn't that the proper analysis?

MR. CASEY:

6

You are interfering with

Our position is that the plaintiffs

MR. CASEY:

If there was a -- if there was a

be entitled to a lesser amount than they received the

MS. LaBELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would first like to just clarify briefly one

8

of the inquiries of Justice O'Connor and that in this

9

case, both in the Glover and Hadix, the defendants have

10

paid at pre-PLRA rates all of the fees up to the date of

11

enactment of the act.

The way that happened is the -The date of the enactment or the

effective date of the act?

QUESTION:

16

what counsel has just told us.

17

Up through April 26th, 1996.

The fees have been paid, contrary to

Yes.

They did not seek review of

18

the Sixth Circuit's prior opinions in both Hadix and

19

Glover awarding specifically that pre-enactment --

20

QUESTION:

So, in your view, the only thing at

date of PLRA?

Sixth Circuit and at the later opinion they asked that

they be able to go back and reclaim them.

3

QUESTION:

Did they pay them because the

district court required them to?

them all, didn't they?

6

I mean, they did contest

They did contest them.

They paid

7

them because the court of appeals affirmed the district

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but it was not a voluntary

payment and then they sought to get it back.

11

MS. LaBELLE:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's correct.

They didn't pay until ordered to do

so by the court.

14

MS. LaBELLE:

They challenged it in the Sixth

11

was the subsequent opinion which covered both pre and post

awards, pre and post fee awards, that they sought review

15

They did not seek review of that prior opinion.

QUESTION:

It

Why did the subsequent opinion

addrass it if it had been paid under the earlier opinion?

16

MS. LaBELLE:

Because the original opinion dealt

17

with a time period way before the passage of the act from

18

June 1995 through December 1995, which the court, because

19

they contested some other matters, didn't hold a hearing

and get around to awarding until after the passage of the

act.

However, if you apply this Court's other general

for concluding that Congress intended the statute only to

It applies only to a lawsuit that is brought

MS. LaBELLE:

I think that's correct, Your

Honor, to an action brought after the passage of the act.

And it does not apply to pending cases because, while this

Court has, certainly in Landgraf, told Congress that if

8

they want to apply things to pending cases, they should

clearly make that evident in the language of the statute.

Here Congress did in one section of the statute, in 802,

clearly say that this applies to pending cases.

QUESTION:

Well, we didn't say that in Landgraf.

I mean, it depends on what the rule is.

Congress changes, for example, a rule of evidence, as to

Landgraf to say that we would treat that as inapplicable

to cases filed before the rule of evidence was adopted.

19

I mean, if -- if

I think that's true, Your Honor.

I think that in Landgraf the Court set out some narrow

But I think, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, what we're talking about here is that the way

11

these cases were filed were based upon a reliance on the

12

act that existed at that time and which this statute

13

amends.

14

if you bring these cases -- and in fact, Congress evoked

15

the act to induce parties to bring these cases and

16

attorneys to represent these parties who didn't have the

17

wherewithal to challenge their constitutional rights in

18

any other manner -- if you bring these cases, you will

19

have an entitlement to reasonable attorney fees.

20

And the -- the understanding at that time is that

the way the court has always awarded fees is for future

is a retroactive effect on the parties by applying this

act to cases that are pending, I think that Congress --

3

you don't need to get to that if you look at what Congress

4

did here.

QUESTION:

Well, may I raise a question here?

6

have one basically simple problem with your statutory

7

argument, to the extent that you are arguing that at no

8

time may the court prospectively change the rate in this
case to conform to the new -- to the new act.

I

The problem

10

that I have with it is that I assume -- I have to assume

11

-- that Congress legislated against a background of -- of

12

fee award practices in -- in which we -- we all find it a

13

familiar feature of the system, that the court is

14

constantly reexamining fee orders in -- in these

15

continuing cases.

16

don't know whether you did, but I gather a lawyer did in

17

this case and said I ought to paid more, and that was even

18

for work that had been completed.

1

ought to get a higher rate.

20

-- that the background principle against which Congress

21

probably legislated was the principle in which adjustments

22

are made as we go along.

23

Lawyers come in, just as I guess -- I

But in any case, I

And it seems to me that the

Now, we may fight about the retroactive effect

24

of making that adjustment with respect to a post-enactment

25

period for work done before the adjustment is made.

Let's

1

leave that aside.
But with respect to an adjustment which is by

2

3

any standard totally prospective, the adjustment that is

4

made when the court says, from now on any work that you do

5

is going to be compensated at the -- at the rate under the

6

new statute, it seems to me that that is probably in

7

conformance with what Congress would have assumed as a

8

background principle for the way fee awards in continuing

9

cases are made.
Now, is -- is my simple problem subject to a

10
11

simple answer?
MS. LaBELLE:

12

Your Honor, if -- perhaps in cases

13

where you're in monitoring, but that would not be the

14

way - -

15

QUESTION:

Which is what we have here.

16

MS. LaBELLE:

Correct, but this would also apply

17

to cases where attorneys are in midstream on a case, where

18

they started the case under the understanding that they

19

would get those fees.
QUESTION:

20

Well, what -- may I question that?

21

How many -- this is really a question.

It's not just a

22

rhetorical question.

23

let's say, prison litigation cases -- with a -- a clear

24

understanding about what the hourly rate is going to be if

25

they win?

How many lawyers begin cases --

Is that -- is that commonly done?

Do we go

into court and pretrials in these cases and say, if you're

2

the prevailing party, you're going to get X dollars an

3

hour?

4

MS. LaBELLE:

I think, Your Honor, the answer to

5

some extent is not X dollars an hour, but prevailing

6

party, yes, that you will not suffer --

7

QUESTION:

Do they say that at pretrials, or is

8

that again just kind of a background principle upon which

9

everybody behaves?
MS. LaBELLE:

10

I think in these difficult cases,

11

it is the background principle, that if in these difficult

12

cases, you do prevail, you will not -- it will not be a

13

punishment.

14

in order to do these cases.

15

You will -- you're not sacrificing other work

QUESTION:

But is the prevailing rate understood

16

as the prevailing rate for fee awards in the Federal

17

courts for assigned counsel cases or the prevailing rate

18

in the bar in general?

19

wrong.
MS. LaBELLE:

20

I assume the former, but maybe I'm

I think that it has -- it has been

21

determined both by Hensley and in the precedents in -- in

22

the district circuit that we practice in, that it is the

23

prevailing market rate in the community in which you

24

practice.

25

QUESTION:

Is that so?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Casey, would you clarify a

8

factual matter for me?

I had thought that you had said

9

that all of the awards here were retrospective; that is,

10

you came in after 6 months of work, and at that point the

11

court would tell you what rate you would get for the 6

12

months preceding.
But I understood Ms. LaBelle to say the

13
14

opposite, that the court was -- was saying for the next 6

15

months, you're going to get such and such a rate.

16

MR. CASEY:

My understanding is that every 6

17

months, they submit a bill and they ask to be paid at a

18

certain rate for that work which was performed in the

19

past.

25

QUESTION:

And the order does not say, moreover,

this rate will continue for the next 6 months.
MR. CASEY:

Correct.

I do not believe the

orders say that.
QUESTION:

Is there any indication here that

Congress focused specifically on what I'd call prison

2

cases, as compared to just an ordinary case where a

3

prisoner says I'm being held under bad conditions, one

4

person, one time, et cetera?
MR. CASEY:

5

Yes.

What legislative history there

6

is available is focused on these consent decree cases

which go on for decades, not just in Michigan's, although

Michigan's cases were specifically mentioned because

14

MR. CASEY:

QUESTION:

16

MR. CASEY:

I don't know.
No is the answer.
There was a letter introduced into

I do not know how many -- Michigan has 4 pending --

QUESTION:

Is it correct that the theory on

21

which the cases go on so long is that the plaintiffs

22

contend -- maybe their wrong -- that the violations of the

23

Constitution have not been terminated?

24

MR. CASEY:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And the district court must find that

2

to be true in order not to terminate the litigation.
MR. CASEY:

That's correct.

And the problem, as

3

Congress recognized in the PLRA, is that district courts

4

have gotten bogged down in the minutia of management.

5

Sixth Circuit in Hadix in an opinion we've included at

6

page 164 of our brief, in which they remanded the case

court had gotten bogged down in the minutia of remedial

activities rather than focusing on the alleged

different view, namely, is of the view that these judicial

orders were prospective and said that you're entitled to

so much of a rate for the future, that perhaps she -- or

where that -- where that would -- would appear in the

record.

This is an important fact for me and I think the

QUESTION:

How much has the State paid in -- in

the Glover case to date?
MR. CASEY:

Everything.

I don't know specifically over the

16

past 22 years.

For the four cases, consent decree cases,

class actions we have pending now, the difference, if the

$550,000 apparently.
