ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
My client was found guilty of abduction,

11
12

robbery, and capital murder on the basis of testimony by a

13

purported eye witness who claimed at trial that he had

14

seen him forcibly abduct the murder victim in the parking

15

lot of a busy shopping mall.

16

unimpeached, because the Commonwealth of Virginia withheld

17

evidence that cast significant doubt on the reliability

18

and truthfulness of the purported eye witness.

19

That testimony went largely

My submission here is twofold.

First, that

20

Virginia clearly violated the rule of Brady v. Maryland,

21

by withhold material exculpatory evidence; and, second,

22

that there is nothing in this Court's habeas case law that

23

authorizes the withholding of a remedy for that clear

24

violation.

25

QUESTION:

Your second point would cover both

default and prejudice, then, I take it.
MR. ESTRADA:

2

Yes, it would.

It would cover the

3

issues that were framed as issues 2 and 3 in the Court's

4

order granting cert, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

QUESTION:

I'm not sure what you mean by your

6

second point.

7

that's the end of it, you don't have to show cause and

8

prejudice?

9

You mean if there's a Brady violation,

MR. ESTRADA:

We -- yes, in this case, Justice

10

Scalia, and what I mean by that is this.

11

that applies to the prejudice issue under Wainwright v.

12

Sykes is the same standard that the Court recognized in

13

Schlup v. Delo that would apply to the materiality issue

14

under Brady.

15

The standard

There would still remain the issue of cause.

QUESTION:

Of cause, well, let me ask you about

16

cause here.

17

why could it not have been discovered prior to the filing

18

of the State habeas petition?

How was this Brady violation discovered, and

19

MR. ESTRADA:

20

by sheer happenstance.

21

filing of Federal habeas, but before any papers were

22

actually filed for Federal habeas, the district court,

23

under this Court's ruling in McFarland v. Coz, named

24

counsel for petitioner so that he could help him with the

25

Federal habeas papers.

It was discovered, Justice Scalia,
In connection with a contemplated

The record discloses that the district court

1

2

also issued an order that was not directed at any

3

particular claim but that did authorize new counsel to

4

secure pretty much anything in the world that would have

5

my client's name on it, including the files ultimately

6

found to contain the evidence at issue here.

7
8

QUESTION:

Couldn't that have been obtained

before the filing of the State habeas?

9

MR. ESTRADA:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ESTRADA:

Well --

The same thing?
No, Justice Scalia.

Whether in

12

Federal court or in State court we would have had to make

13

a showing directed to the claim that we were seeking to

14

pursue.

15

issued an order that was not based on any showing, or that

16

was not -- and that did not have in mind any actual claim.

17

What the record indicates here is that the court

Wasn't one of the claims in the State

18

them?

20
21

MR. ESTRADA:

No, Justice Scalia,. with all due

respect, that is not actually correct.

23

Wasn't that one of

It was a claim --

With respect, I'm asking a question.

I --

Wasn't it part of the inadequate

1

assistance of counsel claim that was made at one time in

2

State habeas?

3

assistance of counsel was, he didn't make a Brady motion,

4

so isn't the Brady -- the allegation that there was no

5

Brady motion subsumed in the inadequate assistance of

6

counsel?

7

They said one of the reasons for inadequate

MR. ESTRADA:

Justice Kennedy, no.

In fact, the

8

factual bases for the ineffective assistance claim that

9

was pled in the State habeas is a basis that would not

10

give us a freestanding Brady claim.

11

we claim in State habeas is in effect that counsel failed

12

to do so many things that he was in effect absent, he

13

might as well have been a bump in the log, and it was

14

based on a legal theory that was wholly directed to the

15

first prong of the Strickland test.

16

If you look at what

In other words, counsel for the State habeas

17

case sat down with the trial record and in 25 pages listed

18

96 instances of things that the lawyer did not, that

19

seemed from the record were not done, that tended to

20

indicate that for all intents and purposes he might as

21

well have been not there.

22

23

QUESTION:

And one of those things you say was

that he did not pursue a Brady violation.

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

So he was on notice at that point

1

that the Brady violation issue should have been pursued,

2

and yet he did not pursue it.

3

MR. ESTRADA:

No.

He was on notice that counsel

4

had failed to file a motion.

That is, I think, the fair

5

reading of the ineffective assistance --

6

QUESTION:

Okay, but if he had failed --

7

QUESTION:

But that's ineffective assistance of

8

counsel, certainly it must be ineffective assistance of

9

counsel because the Brady violation at least theoretically

10
11

would have turned up something.
MR. ESTRADA:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is the

12

legal theory under which one would usually plead an

13

ineffective assistance claim.

14

certainly open under this Court's cases, to say that

15

someone who at every turn failed to do everything you

16

would expect of a lawyer in a criminal trial might as well

17

not have been there, such that if he was, indeed, absent

18

from the trial, you don't need to show any actual harm

19

with respect to any individual ruling.

It is possible, and it is

20

Now, one may not agree with the legal theory,

21

but all I need to show here is that the legal theory is

22

not one that would give notice of the actual existence of

23

a Brady claim.

24
25

QUESTION:

But in any case, I think it's also

your argument that, even assuming that they would sensibly

1

have thought at least of a Brady claim, there would still

2

have been cause here, because, consistently throughout the

3

litigation, the Commonwealth of Virginia had taken the

4

position that in fact they had an open file and therefore

5

that, after all, would be cause not to pursue the claim

6

any further than you went.

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, Justice Souter, and in

8

addition there is an additional factor that bears on the

9

issue that was raised by Justice Scalia here.

Not only

10

did they say at page 212 and page 213 of the J.A. --

11

that's at the outset of Volume 2 -- that from the outset

12

of litigation, i.e., from the trial, we have been in

13

compliance with Brady through the open file so that it was

14

a representation that they had always been in compliance.

15

QUESTION:

Well, leaving Brady aside, and

16

correct me if I'm wrong, leaving Brady aside, my

17

understanding is that Virginia does not have in its open

18

file or in its prosecutor's file investigative reports

19

such as Claytor's, correct?

20
21
22

MR. ESTRADA:
Justice Kennedy.

That is actually not accurate,

If you look at page --

QUESTION:

Well, but I had thought part of your

23

submission was that you couldn't get these reports under

24

Virginia rule because they're investigative reports that

25

are not disclosable.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

3

MR. ESTRADA:

Once

Absent Brady.
Once the State had made a judgment

4

that they were not covered by Brady, we could not go into

5

a court because it would be deemed privileged.

6

look at page 368 of the J.A., when counsel for the State,

7

who was the trial lawyer for the State, was asked, how did

8

you comply with Brady, his response was, my open file

9

contained everything that was discoverable under Brady,

If you

10

including any reports that were discoverable under Brady.

11

To -- in fact --

12

QUESTION:

Well, but then you're making Brady

13

more or less self-executing.

14

Brady, it's automatically cause.

15

MR. ESTRADA:

If you don't produce under

Justice Kennedy, given that this

16

Court held in the Amadeo case that concealment is always

17

cause if it is established, and given that it is an

18

element of the Brady claim that there would be withholding

19

of the evidence, it would ordinarily be the case that if

20

you have a Brady claim in which you are able to make out

21

the elements of the claim, you would almost be there on

22

the issue of cause.

23

QUESTION:

Concealment suggests something

24

affirmative though, does it not?

25

MR. ESTRADA:

Concealment suggests, indeed,

something affirmative, and --

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Not just a failure to disclose, but

an effort to actually hide.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it is a failure to disclose

5

and at least coupled with a representation that everything

6

had been turned over.

7

QUESTION:

And I take it that's --

8

QUESTION:

And you do -- you do assert here that

9

there was a representation by counsel for the State, both

10

at the trial level and then again by the Attorney General

11

on post conviction.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, we do, Justice O'Connor.

You do not at the trial.

You do not

14

at the trial level assert that he said there were -- you

15

had the open files, and everything relevant was in the

16

open files.

17

MR. ESTRADA:

18

QUESTION:

No, but --

You -- that statement is only made in

19

the middle of the State habeas proceeding and therefore

20

cannot explain your failure to do anything at the

21

commencement of the State habeas proceedings.

22

deceived after you had already been in default of your

23

obligation.

MR. ESTRADA:
two reasons.

1

was that there was something called an open file, and the

2

open -- and the issue then is, is that a representation

3

that that is how they are complying with Brady, because if

4

the words open file mean, this is in discharge of my Brady

5

duties, the representation was unquestionably made at the

6

trial level, and we --

7

QUESTION:

But prosecutors always say they

8

comply with Brady.

And you're in effect saying, once

9

there's a representation we've complied with Brady, you

10

have no independent obligation to pursue a Brady

11

violation, and I just don't think you have any law for

12

that play.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, Justice Kennedy, two points.

14

I do have the Amadeo case for the proposition that

15

concealment by the State is actually a showing of cause,

16

and the other point that I think is significant for

17

further purposes, for these purposes is that this is the

18

type of evidence that is uniquely in the possession of law

19

enforcement.

20

These are not matters that might conceivably be

21

in the public record, and that the lawyer for the

22

Government somehow also has.

23

the byproducts of the investigation itself, so if we're

24

talking about a class of evidence as to which the rule

25

that I'm urging and that I think is warranted by the

1

Amadeo case makes perfect sense, it is in this very

2

context.

3

To get back to the point that I was just about

4

to make to Justice Scalia, the State did represent at

5

trial that there was an open file, and it seems clear from

6

the record that we have now -- that the words open file

7

were an affirmative representation that this was in

8

compliance with Brady for at least two reasons.

9

Number 1, at page 368 of the joint appendix,

10

when the trial lawyer for the State was asked, in Federal

11

habeas, when his interests to say that it meant something

12

else would have been strongest, he said, I comply with

13

Brady through my open file.

14

other side.

15

That's what I was giving the

It was Brady that was the open file.

QUESTION:

That says nothing more than what

16

Justice Kennedy says.

17

representation, and sometimes an explicit representation

18

by the prosecution that it has turned over the files that

19

the law requires it to turn over.

20

implicit -- every Brady violation constitutes that, and

21

therefore you're in effect saying you don't have to show

22

cause as well as not having to show prejudice once there's

23

a Brady violation.

24
25

MR. ESTRADA:

There's always an implicit

That's always an

Justice Scalia, I think it is not

quite the same thing, because failure to disclose the

1

exculpatory evidence under the Brady case law without a

2

request and without a representation of any sort, implied

3

or expressed, is a completed Brady violation if the

4

materials are exculpatory and material, if they're

5

important enough.

6

In other words, there need not be a

7

representation by defense counsel or by the prosecutor for

8

a Brady claim to arise, so I am saying something that is

9

not quite what you adverted to, because I am saying that

10

here we could have a Brady violation that flows from the

11

withholding of the information alone, and we have more.

12

We have the prosecutor in effect quelling any doubts that

13

reasonable defense counsel might have had by saying --

14

QUESTION:

May I ask you something about a

15

procedural course, even before you get into all of this?

16

I understand there's a notion of exhaustion.

17

we require you go through the State habeas, first.

18

That's why

Nothing more was known at the Federal level than

19

was known at the State level.

20

for sweeping discovery that was made successfully in the

21

Federal court, was not made in the State court.

22

remedy that was availed of in the Federal court was not

23

even sought.

The motion for discovery,

So a

Now, if they had asked and the State said no,
you can't discover, and then you came to Federal court and

asked for the same thing, that would be one thing, but

2

what excuses the failure to make in the State court the

3

procedural move that you made in the Federal court?
MR. ESTRADA:

4

Two -- two issues, Justice

5

Ginsburg. I think that first, for all intents and

6

purposes, we did.

7

moved to dismiss the ineffective assistance of counsel

8

point, they did so on the legal theory that was earlier

9

outlined by the Chief Justice.

In the State habeas, when the State

They said in effect, you

10

have no basis for thinking that any of these failures by

11

counsel caused you actual harm.

12

you're absolutely correct, we do not.

investigate further.

And we replied by saying,
That's why we want

have no current basis for thinking that any of these

17

rulings caused you harm, there is no need for further

investigation.

be done.

20

There is no need for anything further to

Your case should be dismissed.
It seems to me that once the State came back and

21

said that we had no actual basis for the assertion of any

22

harm from any of the many items that added up to

23

ineffective assistance of counsel, and we asked for the

24

court's help so that we could investigate it further and

25

were successfully opposed by the State, it would have

1

been -- it is really the functional equivalent of asking

2

for the information.

3

QUESTION:

Whenever you ask for the court's

4

help, you implicitly ask for whatever you should have

5

asked for, is that the principle you want us to accept?

6

MR. ESTRADA:

7

QUESTION:

No.

The principle is that --

You should have asked for these --

8

for the documents that related to your client that were

9

the documents of the investigation.

And I don't see how a

10

general throwing yourself upon the assistance of the court

11

complies with that.

12

precisely what it is you're seeking from the State.

The court has some basis to know more

13

MR. ESTRADA:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well --

Not just say, give us help for

whatever we need.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, that's -- but this is highly

17

germane to the questions that Justice Ginsburg asked,

18

because that was exactly the motion if -- if one was made

19

in Federal court.

20

If you look at the order that issued from

21

Federal court, and by the way, we have been working on the

22

assumption that it was a result of a motion, though I

23

can't find any such motion in the record.

24

you may take this order, new counsel, and go to anyone who

25

conceivably may have a document with your client's name on

The order is,

1

it and see if you can get it.

2

QUESTION:

And it had nothing to do with Brady

3

or not specifically to do with -- it was just a total,

4

sweeping, discover anything about this case --

5

MR. ESTRADA:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.

-- psychiatric evidence -And as it happens the Fourth

8

Circuit since then has ruled that this sort of ex parte

9

discovery may not be conducted, so this is something that

10

could not arise in the Fourth Circuit in the present day.

11

That is why I said at the outset that it is important to

12

note that the documents came up as -- by sheer

13

happenstance.

14

This is exactly like the Amadeo case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, the State seems to

15

suggest that the petitioner's lawyers knew of the witness

16

Stoltzfus' materials at the time of the trial.

17

respond to that?

I understand that to be --

are a series of statements made over a period of time by

MR. ESTRADA:

And you take the case on that

assumption, at least for ruling -QUESTION:

And so how do you respond to their

12

assertion that you had them all?

13

MR. ESTRADA:

I -- their claim is based on a

14

one-paragraph affidavit by one of the counsel for

15

Mr. Strickler, Mr. Roberts, who asserts in fact that he

16

does not recall ever seeing any of these documents, but

17

that he does recall some unspecified information that is

18

reflected in them that led him to think that her story had

19

gotten better over time.

20

The district court was faced with that affidavit

21

and concluded that weighed against the affidavit from the

22

very same trial prosecutor that he could not recall ever

23

seeing any of these five documents, it was insufficient to

24

give rise to an issue of fact on whether, on the five

25

documents that the case is here on, we in fact ever had

The evidence that is reflected in those five

documents is qualitatively and quantitatively different

4

from what we may have had from other sources at the time

of the trial.

6

QUESTION:

But that isn't the point, whether you

with the boyfriend of the deceased.

MR. ESTRADA:

Justice Scalia, there are two

answers to that.

lawyer may have reason to think that, as Roberts put it,

16

this is too good to be true.

17

is a vast difference between saying this can't be right

18

and being able to take the documents and confront the

witness with them.

is whether he should have at that point pursued a Brady

claim.

MR. ESTRADA:

That's correct, and I will point

out that we sent an investigator to talk with

12

Ms. Stoltzfus in advance of the trial, and his affidavit

is in the record, and she inquired on whose behalf he was

there for, was told that it was on behalf of Strickler,

You were asked -- I don't remember

whether it was by the court or put on as, it were, on the

spot by the State in saying, do you have any specific

reason to believe, or any evidence that you were in fact

prejudiced.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

And your response to the court was,

11

no, that's why we want discovery.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

13

That's why we want expert

assistance.

QUESTION:

Okay, expert assistance.

at that point that the State in effect was mute in the

sense that the State obviously did not say at that point,

in effect did not have a basis for claiming harm from the

various items that we claimed, and that is at page 234 of

MR. ESTRADA:

Let me take the last question

first, Justice Ginsburg, because under the Brady doctrine

the good faith and the bad faith of the prosecutor is

20

irrelevant, and under Kyles, they had an affirmative duty

21

to seek out law enforcement agents who may have had

involvement in the investigation to ensure that they had

QUESTION:

I didn't think that, but I'd really

like you to concentrate on the prejudice for this reason.

Kyles was a case where the argument was that the Brady

Here, as I understand, it's not -- that's not

the claim.

You are not claiming, or are you, that

Strickler would be a nonparticipant?

I thought that the

10

only thing that you thought you could do with this is to

11

say, the chief man was Henderson and not Strickler.

You would be on very shaky ground, I

would think, in view of the evidence, if you did.
MR. ESTRADA:

10

Well, I do not think that that is

11

correct, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think you are

a jury would be entitled to find is entitled to no

That is not true, Justice Breyer,

because there were in effect two other witnesses, one of

them is Donna Tudor, and she has terribly incriminating

9

things to say, which, for the reasons I pointed out in the

10

brief, should be discounted.
The other one was Curt Massey, who all he could

12

say was that he saw my client on the road, it was night,

she had the number of people in the car wrong, and the

race of the people in the car wrong, if one were to

credit --

QUESTION:

So what I should do to satisfy myself

is read through the record, and if I think there is

I don't think that can be taken,

first of all, as an unequivocal statement for a number of

reasons.

First of all -QUESTION:

4

Well, you said known to the

5

Government.

Doesn't that mean any agency of the

6

Government for purposes of Brady?
I mean, Brady -- it's very clear at this point

7
8

that the Brady obligation does not depend on the

9

prosecutor's particular knowledge of an item of evidence.

10

If anyone representing the Government in that

11

investigation had the evidence, the Government has an

12

obligation to turn it over.

13

So that when you make a -- or when someone made

14

a statement that everything known to the Government had

15

been disclosed, and it's in connection with, among other

16

things, a Brady issue that arises because of the

17

ineffective assistance of counsel motion, isn't the only

natural reading of that response to be, yes, for Brady

19

purposes everything known to the Government has been

in the world is that not adequate cause for going no

5

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, all right, assuming that this

is -- that is exactly how counsel could have understood

7

it, as an unequivocal admission that there were no further

8

Brady motion, the reason why it can't operate as cause in

is, of course it's like filing a Brady motion, because you

the affidavit of Thomas Roberts, which said that Strickler

2

was aware, or the defense team was aware at the time of

3

trial that Stoltzfus' testimony had evolved over time and

4

that he was aware of the information contained in the

5

Stoltzfus materials.

6

Now, contrary to what counsel said here this

7

morning, Mr. Roberts' affidavit didn't say, I don't recall

8

seeing these documents.

9

I've seen them.

He said, I don't know whether

I don't remember whether I've seen them,

10

but I know that I knew what was in them, and I know that

11

we were aware at the time of trial that her testimony had

12

apparently evolved.

13

QUESTION:

That isn't the argument given by the

14

Fourth Circuit.

15

that Stoltzfus never testified.

16

because even if she hadn't testified, Strickler never

17

contested that he abducted and robbed Whitlock.

18

counsel for Strickler argued to the jury during the guilt

19

phase they should convict Strickler of first degree murder

20

rather than capital murder because Henderson rather than

21

Strickler actually killed Whitlock.

22

The Fourth Circuit says, let's assume
There was no prejudice,

In fact,

Thus, Stoltzfus' testimony was not critical to

the Commonwealth's case, especially in view of the

argument.
MS. RUMPZ:

2

3

And I stand corrected.

The Fourth

Circuit did not mention the affidavit of Thomas Roberts.

4

QUESTION:

No, no, but I want to know what you

5

think of that argument, because when I read this sentence,

6

in fact, counsel for Strickler argued to the jury during

7

the guilt phase that they should convict Strickler of

8

first degree murder rather than capital murder because

9

Henderson rather than Strickler actually killed Whitlock.

10

When I focused on that I wondered, I'm not sure

11

about Stoltzfus' testimony.

Maybe it is critical, because

12

maybe it was Stoltzfus who said that because Strickler was

13

the gang leader, that put the idea in the jury's mind that

14

indeed Strickler was the one who threw the rock, or helped

15

throw the rock, or directed the throwing of the rock, and

16

without that testimony the jury would have thought no such

17

thing.

18

Now, why isn't that prejudice?

19

MS. RUMPZ:

20
21

First of all, under Virginia law it

doesn't matter who dropped the rock.
QUESTION:

No, I'm not talking about that.

It

22

certainly matters whether the jury thought Strickler was

23

somewhere on the edge of the area in a car looking the

24

other way, or whether Strickler participated in the

25

throwing of the rock and killing the victim.

establishes is that Strickler was the leader of the group,

if she had just been raped and brutally attacked, isn't it

possible that she was immobile at that time?

3

MS. RUMPZ:

I guess it's possible, but I

4

think -- I, of course, stand to be corrected, but I

5

believe that there's testimony in -- from the medical

6

examiner that indicates that probably the first blow with

the rock rendered her unconscious and she didn't feel the

Now, whether the medical examiner was asked

10

whether she was unconscious at the time of that first

11

blow, I can't recollect.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Well, I think your response that you

13

gave to Justice Breyer is rational and responsive, but

14

it's very thin evidence.

15

Stoltzfus' testimony that what -- a Mountain Guy or

16

Mountain Man, who was Strickler, was really the agitator,

17

the prime actor the whole time she observed them at the

shopping center, and this was the prosecution's case, it

killed her.

males had been earlier trying to steal a Lincoln

those males as Strickler and Henderson, and then she

proceeded to watch them for the remainder of the

QUESTION:

She identified

Yes, but I don't think the argument

is the implication of Strickler in the murder.

I think

10

the question that arises, at least it's my question that

11

arises on the prejudice issue, is this.

12

Stoltzfus' testimony was not only, as has been

13

pointed out, that Strickler seemed to be the lead person

14

in this group, but the testimony also was that Strickler

15

was slightly crazy.

16

trying to assess the probability that Strickler and not

17

Henderson was the person who smashed the skull with the

18

rock, the fact that the person is agitated to the point of

19

being strange and weird and crazy is certainly evidence

20

which I think the jury would have considered in saying,

21

yes, the probability is that he was the one who used the

22

rock and for that reason our discretionary decision at the

23

sentencing phase is going to be to recommend death.

that Stoltzfus' testimony was in any way material to the

claimed, the question is whether the jury would have come

on the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit, if her testimony

had been excluded, was subject to very substantial

14

impeachment on cross-examination.

And it seems to me that

15

the answer is quite possibly not.

And that, it seems to

16

me, is the strongest argument for materiality here, and I

17

want to know what your response is to that.

18

MS. RUMPZ:

I guess my response is, as I said

19

earlier to another question, that under Virginia law both

20

participants were equally culpable and equally guilty of

21

capital murder.

22

QUESTION:

Oh, and that goes to their guilt?

23

That goes to their eligibility, I presume under Virginia

24

law

25

MS. RUMPZ:

Uh-huh.

QUESTION:

But my question is directed to the jury's

ultimately discretionary decision.

4

we understand that each one of them is subject to the

death penalty.

The jury says, okay,

We understand the joint triggerman rule.

Our question is -- will, either, I guess, if

they weren't joint trials, our question is, will Strickler

get the death penalty.

And the suggestion is that this

10

of a nut is testimony that would have probably had an

11

influence on the jury, without which the jury might well

12

have come to a different discretionary decision.

13

MS. RUMPZ:

Well, I guess I do disagree with

14

that for a number of reasons.

15

still would have testified, and she still would have

16

testified that that's what she saw.

17

First of all, Ann Stoltzfus

Now, assuming that this -- she would have been

18

impeached with this material, her testimony is still

19

there, and the jury still knows what she saw.

He had 12 prior crimes that were

There's no question about that.
MS. RUMPZ:

And because his crime was vile.

And

I think that when you -- whoever dropped the rock, when

you kidnap a woman, when you take her out into a remote

field, you drop a rock on her head four times so badly

that her skull is embedded in her brain, and there are

indentations inches deep on the ground full of blood, that

12

the fact that an earlier witness is impeached may affect

stretch.

QUESTION:

Why didn't Henderson get the death

penalty?
MS. RUMPZ:

Because Henderson got the benefit of

an improper jury instruction in his trial.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. RUMPZ:

What was the instruction?
The -- he did not receive the joint

21

trig9erm^n instruction, the instruction in Virginia that

says, if both parties are joint participants in inflicting

23

the fatal blows, each is eligible for the death penalty.

QUESTION:

MS. RUMPZ:

So
-- under the Henderson instruction.
Yes.

Henderson, if he had been, if

4

his jury had been instructed as Strickler's jury was

instructed, then the results of Henderson's trial may have

6

been the same as Strickler's.

QUESTION:

8

Wasn't there other direct evidence

of -- that he was the one that dropped the rock?

9

MS. RUMPZ:

And -- thank you, Justice Scalia,

10

there is.

11

that he is the one that dropped the rock and that he was

12

the instigator and the leader.

QUESTION:

What other than Tudor?

What was the evidence other than

Tudor.

That's the evidence.

Anything else?

Just Tudor.

Tudor is the evidence, and -Is there any reason why Tudor would

have wanted to put it on him rather than on Henderson?
MS. RUMPZ:

None that I know of.

I mean,

22

there -- the theory has always been that Donna Tudor was

23

trying to protect herself.

herself equally by ratting out Henderson as opposed to

Strickler, but the fact of the matter is, she testified

Strickler was her boyfriend as

MS. RUMPZ:

Her week-long boyfriend, yeah.

trial, too, and was the prosecution's theory there that

Henderson was the second man?
MS. RUMPZ:

Henderson's trial.

Yes, and she did not testify at
She testified at Strickler's trial.

10

Henderson had made a confession to another gentleman who

11

ultimately was called at Strickler's trial in defense of

12

Strickler, but the Commonwealth called this gentleman to

13

prove Strick -- to prove Henderson's involvement in Leanne

14

Whitlock's killing.

15

Tudor wasn't needed in that regard.

And in Strickler's trial Tudor was needed

16

because she was the one that overhead him talk about using

17

a rock crusher on a nigger, and Whitlock, of course, was

18

black, so that definitely is additional evidence

QUESTION:

Of course, she had all the jewelry

MS. RUMPZ:

1

No.

It definitely goes to the

2

materiality of Stoltzfus' testimony, because Strickler --

and in closing argument, additionally, never contested

that any of what Stoltzfus saw at the trial was correct,

Even if he had impeached Stoltzfus,

10

even if he had impeached Stoltzfus with his testimony he

11

still would have had to explain why he was at that mall,

12

because two other people put him at that mall.

would have had to explain his possession of the car not an

QUESTION:
