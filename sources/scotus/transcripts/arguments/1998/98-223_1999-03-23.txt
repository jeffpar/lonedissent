ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN M. SNURKOWSKI

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Today the State is here before the Court seeking

11

to have the Florida Supreme Court opinion in White v.

12

State reversed based on that court's determination that a

13

requirement under Florida law and under the Fourth

14

Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that

15

there be a neutral magistrate sought and a warrant

16

obtained prior to the seizure of a vehicle under the

17

Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act.

18

The State would direct its attention to cases,

19

in particular, Cooper, in particular, United States v.

20

Watson as controlling in this case.

21

will focus on the applicability of Horton to this case and

22

the plain view theory that has been presented in some of

23

the briefs.

QUESTION:

The Solicitor General

The way this came up, Ms. Snurkowski,

the car and that was introduced at trial?
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

2

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

What

happened on October 14th, 1993, the defendant was at his

place of business.

5

had the ability to go there under a search warrant to

arrest him for unrelated drug charges.

was placed under arrest.

It was not searched.

11

seized at that point.

It was taken to the task force

12

facility.

13

cocaine rocks were found wrapped in toweling in the

14

ashtray of the car.

15

QUESTION:

At that point it was searched.

It was just

Two crack

And was the car taken because it was

16

forfeitable, or was it taken just because he was arrested

17

and something had to be done with the car?

18

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

This was not incident to a

19

lawful arrest and it was not because of anything more than

20

the officers' belief that it was under forfeiture.

21

had been three previous occasions when Mr. White was seen

22

dealing drugs out of the car, and under Florida statutes

23

920 -- 32.701 through 04, the State has the ability to

24

seek forfeiture of a vehicle that's used as an

25

instrumentality.

QUESTION:

So, from the moment they -- they put

2

the key in it and took it away it was because it was

3

forfeitable.

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

5

QUESTION:

And how long --

6

QUESTION:

Did they have probable cause to

Yes, Your Honor.

7

believe that the vehicle had been used for the

8

transportation of drugs?

9

11

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

I'm sorry.

I didn't hear the

first part of your question.
QUESTION:

Did the officers -- has it been

12

determined that they had probable cause to believe that

13

the vehicle, which they seized, had been used to transport

14

illegal drugs?

15

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Yes, Your Honor.

There had

16

been three previous occasions where one of these officers

17

had personally observed and there were videotapes of the

18

defendant actually selling drugs out of the car.

19

QUESTION:

And Florida law makes the car used

20

for that purpose to be -- makes it possible to forfeit it

21

to the State.

22

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

23

QUESTION:

Subject to forfeiture.

Now, you don't rely on the G.M.

24

Leading Corporation case?

25

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

QUESTION:
closest case.

I would have thought that was the

You didn't even mention it.

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

I believe that that has been

4

mentioned in the other briefs.

5

this case, we believe that that is a pertinent and germane

6

case to this one.

7

But, yes, in looking at

The reason the State started out with the Cooper

8

decision is it's believed that that in that case there,

9

the subject matter of scrutiny was the search following

10

the seizure, and the seizure at that point was -- was

11

under a forfeiture statute and was not in question.

12

seems reasoned and followed that if in this instance where

13

the inventory search is not in question in this instance,

14

that both the seizure and the search are satisfied --

15

satisfies the Fourth Amendment with regard to practices

16

engaged in by the Florida authorities.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

19

QUESTION:

It

Ms. Snurkowski, what -Yes.

-- what troubles me about the case is

20

the long time interval between the -- between the time

21

when the -- the police had probable cause to believe that

22

the vehicle had been used for a crime and the time when

23

they elected to -- to seize it as forfeit.

24

raises the possibility of -- of the police creating a -- a

25

sort of a evidence depository by simply identifying a car

and just leaving that car out there for years and years

2

until they -- until they finally determine that it -- it

3

has evidence that they'd like to have, whereupon they --

4

they move in and seize it.

5

there?

I mean, that doesn't seem right to me.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

6

What -- what assurance is

Well, first of all, in this

7

instance, all of the activities that occurred that

8

generated the need or the ability by the State to forfeit

9

occurred prior to any activity going on with regard to

10

this -- this last event.

11

13

his car.

It wasn't that the car was
There had been

The probable cause that generated -- was

15

generated by that -- was to forfeit the car.

16

to ascertain or have probable cause to seize the car.

17

fact, the car couldn't have been seized at the moment they

18

saw the drugs being dealed --

19

QUESTION:

It was not
In

Well, I know that, but that's my very

20

point.

If you say they seize it right away, I don't see a

21

potential for abuse, but if you say once they see it being

22

used for a drug transaction, they can thereafter just put

23

in their file, you know, license number, whatever, can be

24

seized at any time, and then wait until they think there

25

may be some evidence in that car.

And the real reason

1

they're seizing it thereafter, or at least the real reason

2

for their timing, is to obtain the evidence and not to --

3

and not to forfeit the car.

4

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Well, in all due respect, I

5

think that under Whren, this Court has indicated that we

6

are looking at an objective standard as opposed to a

7

subjective standard.

8

legitimate basis under Florida's Contraband statute to

seize the vehicle.

11

The police officers have a

So, they could have done it 3 years

later, 5 years later.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

12

Well, there is certainly case

law that reflects that the time -- the -- the -- it seems

4

to me that the probable cause doesn't become stale,

5

doesn't change because the vehicle itself is the criminal

QUESTION:

That's exactly what troubles me, but

It's --

Would you apply this, Ms. Snurkowski,

but we don't have to go before any magistrate or anything

like that.

would also be okay.

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe --

There's no distinction between those

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

I -- I believe that the

here, not the actions.

21

where one is soliciting for prostitution, the car in and

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

5

QUESTION:

I'm giving you a local ordinance -I'm sorry.

-- that was before this Court where

6

the car was forfeit if it had been used for an act of

7

prostitution.

8

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

And I asked you if in that particular

10

case, the car was impounded on the spot.

11

hadn't been taken then, and the police said, well, it's

12

forfeit, so we'll take it 2 months later.

13

But suppose it

And let's take another case in that same line.

14

Let's suppose the city has a measure that says, cars that

15

are driven by drunk drivers are forfeit.

16

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

17

QUESTION:

Right.

And someone is apprehended for drunk

18

driving, and the police decide, for whatever reason,

19

they're not going to take the car that day and 3 months

20

later they see it at the parking lot of the place of

21

employment and they take it.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

22

Well, I think it depends upon

23

-- again, we're -- the case before the Court is the

24

forfeiture act with regard to the drugs and other criminal

25

endeavors.

suggestion that you have made that it has do with drunk

driving, as we have seen news stories out of -- coming out

3

of the State of New York, that very well may be a basis

4

if, in fact, it's the instrumentality used to -- for help

5

and involved in the crime itself.

6

QUESTION:

I don't suppose getting -- if delay

7

is a problem, I don't suppose getting a warrant would

8

change things.

9
10

MS. SNURKOWSKI:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And --

Well, but would this issue come -- I

11

mean, the reasonableness of the search is going to be

12

judged in part by reference to the -- to the -- or the

13

reasonableness of the seizure is going to be judged in

14

part by reference to the object of the seizure.

15

object of the seizure is -- is punishment.

penalty for -- for the -- for the -- the act involving the

17

contraband.

18

Here the

It's an extra

And I think it's probably accepted -- I think

19

it's accepted -- theory today that the further in time

20

between the act that is being punished and the imposition

21

of the penalty, the less effective it is, the less

22

reasonable it is to be imposing it.

23

me that there's a fair argument that the longer the police

24

wait without some kind of -- or the State waits without

25

some justification, the further removed the seizure

So, it would see to

becomes from the -- the -- a reasonable relationship to

3

And at some point I suppose that would affect

the Fourth Amendment analysis.

5

affect the Fourth Amendment analysis if a warrant were

being applied for.

And I also assume it would

7

Is that an illegitimate argument?

8

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

9

I think there is probably some

truth to the fact that time could pass along, but it

10

doesn't mean that the probable cause in any way

11

deteriorates.

It may be other factors --

QUESTION:

12

Well, that's -- that's right, but the

13

ultimate question is the reasonableness of the search, and

14

you've got to have the probable cause, but we all know

15

probable cause can, in fact, be dissipated or -- or

16

rendered nugatory by various things that happen after you

17

get it.

18

And in Justice Scalia's example, the 5-year wait

19

-- I mean, it -- it really stretches credibility to say

20

that a 5-year wait without, you know, some extraordinary

21

excuse that we don't have in our hypo, can reasonably be

22

related to the ostensibly punitive object of the law.

23

if that is so, don't we in, let's say, the 5-year example

24

-- don't we have to confront the unreasonableness of the

25

search in relation to its object?

Whereas, if you wait 3 years or 6 months to do it, then

2

you have to -- your probable cause determines -- is based

3

on what you can remember of what happened 6 months earlier

4

and the facts are less clear than if they're established

5

and the warrant obtained at the time.

6

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

That's true, but the

7

underpinnings of the probable cause here is that some --

8

an instrumentality, a car, was used during the course of

9

the criminal endeavor.

10
11

That's the basis upon which the

probable cause arises under the Florida statute.
QUESTION:

Well, again, if -- if delay is a

12

problem, do you think the problem would be alleviated by

13

keeping a warrant in the police officer's desk for 3 years

14

and then serving it?

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

No, Your Honor, and that was

16

what I was trying to get to.

17

the facts of this case and I believe most of the facts as

18

presented in the hypotheticals, a magistrate would have

19

issued a warrant the next day or 10 days or 100 days

20

because it was -- if there's probable cause to believe

that that vehicle in fact was used during the course of a

It certainly isn't

The rule --

The rule we're advocating -- and I

decisions -- is that when items of personal property are
found in public areas, they may be seized by law

So -- so, if the vehicle had been

parked in the owner's driveway, could it have been seized?
MR. STEWART:

The driveway is a close question.

16

If it had been parked in the owner's garage, for instance,

17

an area in which the owner would clearly have a reasonable

expectation of privacy, the car could not have been seized

on our view without a warrant.

So, what's your position on the

MR. STEWART:

Our position on the -- our

There was actually a case in the Seventh

Circuit, United States v. Redman, that involved a related

issue in which law enforcement officials conducted a

search of trash cans located at the -- the point of the

individual's driveway that was closest to the house.

7

the en banc Seventh Circuit split 8 to 5, held that the

And

We think the same rule would apply to seizures

that's a settled question.

A car is not per se dangerous.

7

MR. STEWART:

It is partly to impose a

punishment.

It is partly out of a belief that so long as

the car remains in the hands of this owner who has

10

previously utilized it to facilitate criminal activity,

11

there is a danger that that activity will -- will occur in

12

the future.

So --

QUESTION:

Now, if -- if the latter is the

14

rationale, then doesn't the delay that we're concerned

15

about enter into the calculus?

16

a long, long delay before the automobile is seized,

17

doesn't that indicate that it is not such a dangerous

18

instrumentality, that forfeiture should be used?

That is to say, if there's

I'm -- I'm trying to -- to find some standard by

which we could protect owners against the unreasonableness

2

he's allowed to retain and use his property longer than he

3

might have been.

4

I think second we would draw an analogy to

5

warrantless seizures of the person, warrantless arrests.

6

That is, it's established law that a warrantless arrest

7

may be conducted in a public place without a warrant even

8

though a warrant would be required in a private place, and

9

it might seem intuitively as though once police have

10

probable cause to believe that an individual had committed

11

a crime, the natural thing to do would be to arrest him

12

immediately in order to remove the -- the danger from the

14

However, I think it's generally understood that

15

there may be countervailing concerns that would justify

some form of delay.

17

this person was acting in confederation with others, might

want to see whether it could locate bigger operatives

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly the -- the primary

limitation on the amount of delay that would be considered

limitations.

police couldn't wait so long to arrest the individual that

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, let's get to a case, you

I threw out the idea in

-- in talking with -- with your colleague that if the --

if the object is -- is essentially punitive, then there's

13

a point at which the punitive rationale really begins to

14

evaporate, and I don't know when that point was reached,

15

but we thought perhaps if there had been a 5-year wait, it

16

would have evaporated.

17

MR. STEWART:

Would you agree with that?
I -- I think it would depend upon

MR. STEWART:

I -- I -- I agree with that.
If, for instance, Florida by

would be no good because there would be no probable cause

to believe that the property was forfeitable under the

13

That would be so regardless of whether the

MR. STEWART:

Well, the general principle this

Court has announced is that items of personal property

found in a public place may be seized with -- without a

9

warrant, and one of the justifications the Court has given

10

for that general rule is that, at least in many instances,

the property -- personal property, is susceptible of being

moved away quickly, and we think that is all the more true

in the case of an automobile.

suggested a second later that that makes the warrant

there is a warrant requirement, we're going to have some

MR. STEWART:

simply be the legal determination of what period of delay

12

again is no different in principle from the judgment that

13

police may, when they decide whether to effect a

How do you distinguish the Cooper

that point, it was assumed that it was valid, and the only

issue that you decided was once it came lawfully into the

for that proposition.

that their assets were subject to --

warrantless seizure of a vehicle in a public place, and

MR. GAULDIN:

Yes, but G.M. Leasing was not a

20

forfeiture case.

G.M. Leasing was a case where the

21

Government had a tax debt that it was satisfying, which it

22

did by first filing a lien 2 days prior to the seizure in

23

the Salt Lake City County courthouse and then proceeded to

levy on the Government's debt.

as the United States has to enact a taxing statute, does

it not?

MR. GAULDIN:

It certainly does that.

But

6

first, the Constitution specifically provides for the

7

collection of taxes.
Secondly, in Bull v. United States and various

8

9

other cases that you have dealt with in relation to taxes,

you have justified this on the base -- basis of the prompt

collection of the revenue of taxes saying that, in fact,

depends upon the prompt collection of taxes.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I think the question, at least

15

mine, would be, how could it be a reasonable thing to

seize a car in a public place without a warrant to satisfy

There was not only a kind of

Even then it's limited, but it's

1

the seizure of a car under a statute like this does not.

2

MR. GAULDIN:

Yes, yes, yes.

3

Which brings up actually Calero-Toledo.

In

4

Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Company, a vessel

5

was involved, and what they sought in Calero-Toledo was an

6

adversarial pre-seizure hearing.

7

you said that there were three reasons as to why that they

8

were not entitled to an adversarial hearing prior to

9

seizure of the ship.

And in Calero-Toledo,

The first reason was that it would place these

10
11

people on notice that the owners or possessors, in that

12

case the possessors, of the vessel -- it would place them

13

on notice, and that they then might abscond with the

14

vessel.

15

The second thing you were concerned about in

16

Calero-Toledo was that if you gave them an adversarial

17

hearing, which we're not asking for here -- that if you

18

gave them an adversarial hearing, the delay occasioned by

19

that would allow them to continue to use the vessel for

20

illicit purposes.

21

And the third thing you noted in Calero-Toledo

22

was -- or the third reason for which you decided Calero-

23

Toledo was that the disinterested government was the

24

seizing agency and not some interested private

25

agency.

1

Taking the first reason first, we're not asking

2

for an adversarial hearing.

An adversarial hearing might

3

put the person in the car that allegedly has carried

4

illicit contraband on notice, and might give him a reason

5

to flea, but an ex parte judicial warrant won't do that.

6

Secondly, there is certainly no evidence in this

7

case that the government was concerned about continued use

8

of the car for illicit purposes.

9

concerned about that, they wouldn't have waited 68 to 80

If they had been

10

days until, what I contend based on the record, they

11

cavalierly went down and seized the car.

12

And thirdly, the third reason in Calero-Toledo,

13

the government is not disinterested in this case.

14

seizing agency benefits from this.

15

Michigan, you said when the government benefits -- when

16

the government benefits, you have to scrutinize the

MR. GAULDIN:

It is indeed, and too healthy if a

magistrate hasn't reviewed it to make sure -- the

magistrate serves an auditing function in the sense that

you want a disinterested, neutral, and detached

Finally, the government I think relies upon the

Watson case with the idea that if you can seize a person

14

in a public place, why can you not seize the property

itself.

that, of course, is that, first, this is a civil

QUESTION:

But you would think perhaps that

there would be more protections against seizure in a

criminal case than there would be in a civil case.

MR. GAULDIN:

You can be arrested without a

warrant for a felony outside of your home under Watson,

14

under the circumstances of Watson.

15

QUESTION:

So, if the police need a warrant to

16

-- to arrest, in effect, or seize a car in a public place

17

where they have probable cause to know that the -- the car

18

was an instrumentality of a crime, I would certainly think

19

a fortiori they would need a warrant to arrest a person in

20

a public place, although they have probable cause to

21

believe that the person is or has engaged in a crime.

MR. GAULDIN:

Well, the Watson decision holds

logically, but as I recall Justice Powell said that logic

2

would dictate that, but that history is against it.

3

QUESTION:

All right.

So, what we do if we

4

decided in your favor, we would then have to say that

5

these other cases were wrong but simply established the

6

law through precedent.

7

MR. GAULDIN:

Well, no, I don't think you have

8

to say that these other cases were wrong, if you mean

9

Watson, because that's dealing -- it's different because

10

in Watson you have given them certain constitutional

11

protections such as the right to a first appearance within

12

24 hours or 48 hours at the most, the right to a probable

13

cause hearing where the burden is on the government to

14

prove probable cause, the right to appointment of counsel

if you're an indigent to help you make that decision when

16

you don't have those rights, and any rights that you do

17

have here are merely of a statutory and evanescent nature.

QUESTION:

But isn't there a -- a public safety

19

rationale behind the -- the warrantless arrest which does

20

not apply here?

21

MR. GAULDIN:

Yes, there is.

And, in fact, in

22

Watson, they specifically cited an old Massachusetts case,

23

Rohan v. Swain I think, in which they stated that the

24

public safety was implicated in their decision.

what they referred to in -- in basing it on Watson.
