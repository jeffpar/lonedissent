CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

States.
Mr. Morley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN A. MORLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MORLEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fifth Amendment is clear in its language.

11

12

No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a

13

witness against himself, and yet in this criminal case the

14

district court used the defendant's silence, invoked to

15

protect her from risking an increase in her own sentence,

16

as a basis to fashion a sentence.

17

In doing so, the court fundamentally altered the

18

sentencing proceedings from that which had been

19

specifically promised to this defendant at the time of her

20

colloquy, and from that which is generally applicable in

21

criminal process.
QUESTION:

22

Are there cases that tell us what the

23

authority and discretion of the trial court is in

24

inquiring as to the basis for the -- the factual basis for

25

the plea?

At the plea stage, can the trial judge say,

now, I want you to tell me -- I'm not going to accept your

2

plea.

3

of the transactions, and if you don't I'm not going to

4

accept your plea.

I want you to tell me everything that you did, all

Can the trial judge say that?

MR. MORLEY:

5

The trial judge has discretion to

6

make certain that there's a foundation for the guilty

7

plea, and certainly the trial judge can say to the

8

defendant, I'm not going to take your plea unless you tell

9

me everything, but then the trial judge has the

10

opportunity to say, I'm not going to take your plea, and

11

the defendant would also be given the opportunity to say,

12

judge, I'm willing to tell you enough that admits to the

13

essential elements of this offense, but I'm not getting

14

into any sentencing factors.

15

QUESTION:

I'm surprised you can say -- suppose

16

you have three police officers, uncontradicted testimony,

17

overwhelming proof of the guilt, and they testified, and

18

the criminal defendant says, based on what you've heard I

19

plead guilty.

20

discretion to say, I want you to tell me everything that

21

happened or I won't accept the plea?

22

I would --

23

Does the trial judge still have the

MR. MORLEY:

Does he have that --

I think the judge has a -- I'm not

24

sure the cases say that he can't accept the plea.

25

authority to make sure that there's a factual foundation,

2

a factual statement, and that -QUESTION:

3
4

But once he does that, doesn't his

discretion end?

5

MR. MORLEY:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, it does, and I think under -Because if it does, it seems to me to

7

make your case easier, although I haven't seen cases on

8

this.
MR. MORLEY:

9
10

I haven't seen cases on that, but

think Libretti -QUESTION:

11

In a plea colloquy you're typically

12

told you're waiving a privilege against self-

13

incrimination.

14

MR. MORLEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

Typically that's true.
In this case, Judge Cahn told the

defendant that, I think.

17

MR. MORLEY:

Well, Your Honor, actually what

18

Judge Cahn said -- and I refer to page 45 of the joint

19

appendix toward the top -- Judge Cahn said, you have the

20

right at trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment

21

or at your option you can take the stand and tell the jury

22

your side of the controversy, so Judge Cahn specifically

23

limited the waiver of the Fifth Amendment to the right at

24

trial.

25

QUESTION:

Well, you know, I don't know that one

1

would parse it quite that strictly, but I -- that's a

2

permissible point of view, certainly.

3

MR. MORLEY:

But even beyond that, I still

4

believe that the cases point to the fact that one does

5

have a Fifth Amendment right at sentencing.

6

This comes really from two sources.

7

QUESTION:

8

May I -- I'm sorry, I want to go back

to the plea colloquy before we get to the sentence.

9

Would you explain to me your understanding of

10

the difference between the waiver that is involved in

11

speaking to the judge during the plea colloquy and the

12

waiver, if there is a difference in the waiver that a

13

defendant makes on taking the stand at trial?

14

any difference?

15
16

MR. MORLEY:

Is there

Yes, there would be a difference in

that way.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MORLEY:

What is it?
In a plea colloquy the defendant is

19

really giving his or her admission to the essential

20

elements of the offense so that a legal conclusion can be

21

drawn right at that time to the effect that individual is

22

guilty.

23
24
25

That is all that it's involved in.
At a trial, when a defendant takes the witness

stand -QUESTION:

Well now, just a minute.

1

have to ask enough at the plea colloquy to satisfy

2

yourself as the trial judge that the facts that occurred

3

amount to a commission of the alleged offense.

4

MR. MORLEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Precisely, and -And presumably the judge could have

asked about the quantity of drugs.
MR. MORLEY:

Well, this Court in Libretti made

8

clear that forfeiture is a sentencing issue, and therefore

9

need not be part of the factual understanding, the factual

10

11
12

13

statement under Rule 11.
QUESTION:

What was the statute under which the

petitioner was charged here?
MR. MORLEY:

This was a drug statute, 8

14

was the conspiracy statute.

15

which drug quantities are not part of the -- not an

16

element of the offense, but they are part of the

17

sentencing.

And you conceive that the quantity of

the drugs is not an element of the offense here.
MR. MORLEY:

Absolutely, it is not an element of

the offense.
QUESTION:

And would it be an abuse of

23

discretion for the judge to say, I'm not going to take the

24

guilty plea if I have to go through all this thing on

25

sentencing.

You have to tell me how much drugs were

MR. MORLEY:

I would be willing to give a judge

I'm not sure that it's an abuse of

discretion.

I think our district court judges are by and

Well then,

the privilege you're

7

talking about is not as important as I thought it was from

8

your brief.

MR. MORLEY:

Well,

too much, Justice Kennedy, but at any rate --

could make him tell.

MR. MORLEY:

21

No.
You're just saying he may not enter

the plea unless you --

MR. MORLEY:

the defendant must go to trial.

1

back to the question that I started with or, it seems to

2

me what you're saying is that the essential difference

3

between the waiver and when the individual stands up at

4

the Boykin hearing and the waiver when the individual

5

takes the stand is that the only waiver that's being given

6

in the Boykin hearing is the waiver that in fact is made

7

with each individual representation of fact by the

8

defendant for purposes of entering the plea, and that's as

9

far as the waiver goes.
MR. MORLEY:

10
11

That's as -- exactly, that's as far

as the waiver goes, and -QUESTION:

12

And you're saying that the judge can

13

condition his acceptance of the plea upon the defendant's

14

yielding a constitutional right that the judge has no

15

power to demand that he yield.

16

doctrine of unconstitutional conditions?

17

plea, but only if you give up your constitutional right

18

not to tell me this.

19

QUESTION:

Doesn't this violate the
I'll accept this

Well, you give up the constitutional

20

right to trial, the constitutional right to -- you give up

21

a lot of constitutional rights when you plead guilty,

22

don't you?

23

MR. MORLEY:

Yes, precisely.

24

But if I could get back to Mr. Justice Souter's

25

question about the difference at a trial, at a trial, the

1

waiver concept there is where a defendant would testify,

2

and in that sense would be giving up his entire right

3

because he is testifying, and that the -- and the

4

Government would have the opportunity to cross-examine him

5

on that testimony, and really what underlies that waiver

6

is a rule of fairness.

7

We're not going to let a defendant get up in

8

front of a jury, testify as to facts, and then cut off

9

cross-examination to matters that are relevant at trial.

10

In the guilty plea context the sentencing issue

11

is simply not relevant.

Sentencing factors are not

12

relevant to the waiver of the --

QUESTION:

Well, suppose -- suppose the --

MR. MORLEY:

elements of the offense.

18

QUESTION:

No, but they can.

It seems to me

19

that it -- and I -- this doesn't happen in every case, of

20

course, but it seems to me that it may very well be open

21

to a judge to say the following at the Boykin hearing.

22

Number 1, this is not an Alford plea.

You're

23

not standing here saying, look, I really didn't do it, but

24

you know, there's a reason for pleading and so on, so

the things that were charged.

2

I, the judge, sort of believe that truth inheres

3

in the details, and I'm not going to be satisfied that the

4

basis is being given for this upon which I'm going to

5

premise a knowing and voluntary waiver unless you go

beyond conclusory details saying yes, I had drugs, or

what-not.

1

consequences to which he is legitimately open by virtue of

2

his conduct, and that involves an appreciation not only of

3

theoretical legal consequences but of the actual conduct,

4

too, so that's the justification for the judge's inquiry.
MR. MORLEY:

5

Except the judge can achieve that,

6

as Judge Cahn did in this case, by engaging in a colloquy

that lays out, you've reserved for sentencing the drug

QUESTION:

But -On the other hand, you've saying -If you say, Mr. Morley, that what

15

happens at sentencing is not really an element of the

offense at all, then why is it subject to the privilege

against self-incrimination?

MR. MORLEY:

I would say two things.

QUESTION:

But when the defendant has pleaded

guilty in a case and actually been sentenced, there's no

9

question that particular defendant could not again invoke

the privilege against self-incrimination.
MR. MORLEY:

11
12

As to this -- as to that

individual, incriminatory -- exactly.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MORLEY:

15

QUESTION:

That particular element.
Yes.
And what do you do in your analysis,

16

if you say this is subject to the privilege against self-

17

incrimination, with cases like Brown v. Walker and Blau v.

18

United States, which says, once you've started to say

19

something, once you've started to tell your story that

20

would incriminate you, you can't stop wherever you want

21

to?

No, it doesn't, but it's what under

I don't think Blau, the language in

Blau doesn't say sense of fairness.

I think that that's what -- well,

that's the way I read Blau and read Brown v. Walker.

MR. MORLEY:

Judge, that statement that

It was just a final

QUESTION:

1

You were appealing a little earlier

2

to what you saw as a kind of a judicial fairness

3

rationale.

4

position here, because when someone accepts -- makes a

5

plea agreement the defendant is making the agreement

6

because it's a good deal.

7

I would suppose that would work against your

The -- supposedly the sentencing risk is at

8

least reduced to something that the individual can accept,

9

and the individual avoids, in fact, the very messy details

10

of trial which can affect a judge a great deal in the

11

discretionary sentence.
If the defendant is going to get what we presume

12

13

is a comparatively good deal by making the --by entering

14

the plea on the fairness criterion and I suppose the

15

person ought to be forthcoming about the specific facts

16

that might bear on sentence when you get to the sentencing

hearing.

MR. MORLEY:

That might be true if there were a

plea agreement, but in this case this is a -- this was an

Oh, was this a -- this was an open

plea.

and that was a condition of a -- it was a conditional

2

guilty plea, in that sense.

3

QUESTION:

In a typical case, not necessarily

4

yours, where there was a specific reservation, but in a

5

typical case the judge has to satisfy himself that there

6

is a factual basis for the plea and, in doing that, I

7

guess the defendant either might specifically or through

8

an admission to someone else's recitation of the facts

And given that, what happens at a

sentencing hearing, where the Government has the burden of

proof, is that they will start calling defendants as

witnesses to extract from them what it is, in fact, they

MR. MORLEY:

The problem with doing that, Your

that there are jury trials.

it's an impermissible burden on the Fifth Amendment.

offense.

MR. MORLEY:

Well, that's a burden on -That's a burden on the Fifth

At that

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A plea of guilty is an admission of a crime, and

21

therefore inherently constitutes self-incrimination.

The

22

effect of a guilty plea that has been entered by a court

23

is therefore to waive the privilege against self­

24

incrimination with respect to the conduct underlying the

25

charge to which the defendant has admitted, and it follows

from that that a court may at sentencing draw an adverse

2

inference from the defendant's failure to amplify and

3

explain the conduct in which she engaged that underlies

4

the crime.
QUESTION:

Could the court at sentencing say,

I'm calling the defendant to the stand, and then just

examine the defendant?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

Yes, Justice Kennedy, under the

principle --

10

QUESTION:

I think you'd have to say that.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that under the waiver

analysis of a guilty plea the judge could do that at least

13

as to the events that underlie the very count of

14

conviction to which the defendant has admitted guilt.

wrong -- if the target of the investigation testifies at

subsequent indictment and a trial.

doing here is to say that same sort of analogy applies

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right.

The petitioner is

attempting to construct two wholly separate proceedings

applicable only for one proceeding.
QUESTION:

Does that change the situation, then,

that the judge apparently went along with.

it, Justice O'Connor.

She didn't reserve any privilege

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, our position is that she

5

inherently waives it when she stands before the court and

6

says, I am guilty of this charged offense.

7

what the Government has alleged is a violation of the law

8

that I committed.

9

QUESTION:

I admit that

That's all she admitted.

She didn't

10

admit, you know, how much of the drug she had.

11

violated this statute, but she didn't admit all of the

12

sentencing elements.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

QUESTION:

She

She did not.

So why must she admit it now?

I do

15

not see the parallel that you seek to draw between taking

16

the stand in a criminal trial at the guilt stage, and

17

whereupon you can be examined about anything related to

18

the crime, and this situation, because where a person

19

takes a stand in a criminal trial, that person is using

20

his or her testimony as a sword, attacking the Government

21

with it.

22

Whereas, where the person has pleaded guilty,

23

the person is not using his testimony -- in fact, he's

24

using -- not only is it a shield, he's using it as a sword

25

against himself, and you're saying he has to push the

1

sword in further than he has agreed to.
It seems to me they're totally different

2

3

situations, and I do understand why when a person takes

4

the stand the prosecution ought to be able to get

5

everything out of them, but where the person has pleaded

6

guilty, I don't know why the prosecution must have a right

7

to insist that that person plunge the sword in still

8

further.

9

The two situations are not parallel.
MR. DREEBEN:

They are not exactly parallel,

10

Justice Scalia, and I'm not suggesting to the Court that

11

they are exactly parallel.

12

What occurs when this Court has examined the

13

question of what is the scope of a waiver when a defendant

14

takes the stand is, the Court asks, what is reasonably

15

going to be furthered as a policy matter by saying the

16

privilege either goes this far or it ends, and it's

17

concluded that in a criminal trial, or in any trial, when

18

a witness testifies, the fairness of the proceeding

19

requires that all matters that are relevant to cross-

20

examination be deemed to be waived.

21

In this context, there are also very strong

22

reasons to consider the scope of the waiver to be at the

23

minimum all of the conduct that is bound up in the offense

24

to which the defendant pleads guilty.

25

Let me highlight two of the reasons, apart from

1

the generic reason that the plea of guilty itself is an

2

admission that the defendant has engaged in conduct that

3

violates the law.

4

The first is that, at the Rule 11 colloquy, the

5

judge does have a obligation to make sure that the

6

defendant is fully aware of the facts that are alleged to

7

constitute a violation of the law, and agrees that his

8

conduct constitutes that violation.

9

To perform that responsibility adequately, the

10

judge must have the authority to say, look, you know, I've

11

heard what this charge is, it's, for example, murder, but

12

I want to hear you tell me in your own words what you did.

13

Now, the defendant may have killed a person with

14

a gun, and the defendant may also be a felon, and thereby

15

admitting that the defendant had a gun would also

16

implicate the defendant in an independent crime, a section

17

922 violation.

18
19
20

Now, the defendant can't realistically say, I'm
going to tell you, judge -QUESTION:

Oh, he can't realistically, but

21

legally he has the right to say to the judge, the reason

22

I'm not going to tell you more is, it may incriminate me

23

in another offense.

He could legally do that.

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I think that --

Could he not?

Yes, and the judge at that point

I'm going to take -- accept your

plea.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right.

That's right.
And that's why our position is,

8

it's the entry and acceptance of the plea that effectuates

9

the waiver with respect to the conduct underlying the

10

plea.
The defendant who wants to plead guilty and

11

12

spare society the burden of a trial, and perhaps obtain

13

whatever sentencing benefits flow from it, must be

14

prepared to come and tell the court exactly what he did

15

with respect to the charged offense.

16

Now, the first distortion is therefore -- it's

17

going to undercut the judge's ability to carry out the

18

Rule 11 colloquy.

order, it amounts to a voluntary agreement to give up this

2

information by the defendant.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the question that the

4

Court has to answer is, what are the necessary and

5

inherent consequences of the guilty plea, and I think that

6

in answering that question, the Court ought to look at the

7

consequences of going with either petitioner's rule or

8

with our rule.

9

QUESTION:

And that has nothing to do with the

10

Rule 11 situation, it seems to me.

11

ourselves are, what are the necessary consequences of the

12

guilty plea, and it seems to be perfectly reasonable to

13

say, I agree that I'm guilty of the crime, and I say

14

nothing about what the various sentencing factors happen

15

to be.

16

QUESTION:

All we have to ask

And your position, Mr. Dreeben, would

17

be exactly the same no matter what happened at the Rule 11

proceeding --

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

21
22

It is.

That's right.

-- as I understand it.

You'd say

it's inherent in the guilty plea.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, because it has the

23

effect of prescribing to a rule that all the defendant has

24

to do is come up and to say, bare bones, I'm going to say

25

each element, yes, I agree to that.

QUESTION:

2

May I ask in that connection, Mr. --

3

either in this Rule 11 colloquy where the judge is very

4

careful on page 45 to state the nature of the waiver --

5

you give up your right at trial to remain silent.
He did not go on and say, you also will not have

6

7

a right to remain silent if there's a controversy about

8

amount at the sentencing hearing.
In your experience, has there ever been a

9
10

Rule 11 colloquy when the judge explained to him the

11

theory the Government is now espousing?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DREEBEN:

I doubt it, Justice Stevens.

I do, too.
But the judge also doesn't explain

15

to the defendant that upon entry of a final judgment of

conviction you may be subpoenaed to testify at a grand

17

jury with respect to all of the facts and details

18

surrounding the offense to which you pleaded guilty.
QUESTION:

19

No, but this is a routine sequence.

20

You first have the Rule 11, and later you have a

21

sentencing hearing, and if your position is correct, it

22

would seem to me that the ordinary colloquy ought to

23

include an explanation of this consequence, which it

doesn't.

of the rights that he's waiving, and certain of the

consequences of the plea --

8

QUESTION:

Well, suppose you have this sequence,

require the defendant to testify about everything relating

to the transaction, even though his sentencing is pending.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Kennedy, we have not taken

18

the position that the defendant can be required to testify

1

been evolving in the lower courts -- this Court has never

2

squarely addressed it -- is that waivers of Fifth

3

Amendment rights are specific to the case in which they're

4

entered.
QUESTION:

5

Ah, so now this is just a limited

6

waiver we're talking about that's implied from your guilty

7

plea.
MR. DREEBEN:

8

9

That's right, and I don't think

that that's inconsistent with the rule that in your own

10

criminal case, when you have come forward and stood before

11

the court and said, I'm guilty, you've effectuated a full

12

waiver of the conduct underlying that transaction in your

13

own case.

14

Now, the other distortion that can occur besides

15

the distortion of the Rule 11 colloquy is that it gives

16

the defendant who is supposed to be coming forward into

17

court and admitting his guilt a tremendous incentive to

18

minimize his culpability, to conceal facts, and otherwise

19

to hope to skate by during the Rule 11 colloquy with an

20

absolutely bare bones admission of what he has done, and

21

that consequence will similarly undermine one of the

22

societal functions of a guilty plea, which is to get

23

somebody who's willing to come into court and acknowledge

24

what they did to --

1

this case, where she said, I don't -- I do want to contest

2

the amount of drugs, and the judge said, fine, we'll leave

3

that over.

4

I think from what she was told, one is, you are

5

waiving any right that you would have had if you stood

6

trial, and fine, you can contest at sentencing the amount.

7

There seems to be close to an element of a trap

8

for the unwary there, and if the purpose of the Rule 11

9

colloquy -- I thought the purpose of it was to make sure

10

the defendant is informed and uncoerced.

11

Here, she is certainly not informed, because

12

from what was told to her the reasonable inference is,

13

okay, the judge told me I can contest the amount of drugs

14

at sentencing, and all he said about the Fifth Amendment

15

was, trial.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, there is a

17

potentially separate concern that I think your question

18

goes to about adequacy of notice, and whether you were

19

required to legally be given notice of every right that

20

would be waived by your guilty plea before the waiver can

21

be complete.

22

I don't think that this Court's cases have ever

23

said that any right that might be waived or affected by a

24

guilty plea beyond those rights that are specified in

25

Rule 11 needs to be spelled out.

If there were a case-specific claim of

entrapment, as Your Honor put it, that would be a separate

kind of due process claim.

fundamental question of what the legal effect and

5

consequence of the guilty plea is with respect to Fifth

Amendment rights.

7

QUESTION:

It does not go to the

Well, frankly, if I were the trial

8

judge and I heard her say, I reserve the right to contest

9

the amount of the drugs, I would have thought she intended

10

to come up and testify at the sentencing proceeding and

11

say, no, I only had, you know, the lesser amount of the

12

drugs.

13
14
15

I don't know that he was put on notice that she
reserved the right not to say anything.
MR. DREEBEN:

To the contrary.

Well, I think that that's right.

16

I think that what she reserved was the right to say, there

17

weren't so many drugs.

18

QUESTION:

But as long as she reserved it, as

19

long as -- we're talking about something, a fact that she

20

says is in dispute, and she -- it's not an element of the

21

crime, so it really doesn't have to do with the factual

22

basis for the plea, and I take it it's also the case that

23

in the later sentencing hearing what she said about this

24

at the plea, since it didn't concern an element of the

25

crime, is really beside the point.

I mean -- all right.

So given that, you were about to list, and maybe

1
2

you were doing it, the bad consequences that would flow

3

from accepting petitioner's view, what are they?
So far I've heard you say, well, we couldn't go

into the sentence in great detail, we wouldn't find out

all the facts, and that's true.

That's also true when he goes to trial and doesn't waive

Of course that's true.

I mean, I absolutely agree with you that a judge

12

couldn't go into -- by definition couldn't go and find out

from the person who's asserting the right what happened,

MR. DREEBEN:

I think there are really three.

21

One -- and I have tried to cover them, Justice Breyer, so

22

I'm not suggesting I have a new one.

23

One is that I think it's inherently inconsistent

24

with what society expects in a guilty plea, that a

25

defendant will come forward, acknowledge the conduct that

1

they did, and admit that it's a violation of the law, and

2

society can accept that as a method of resolution of a

3

criminal case rather than a trial because there is a value

4

to having somebody acknowledge it.

5

Second is that it will distort Rule 11

6

proceedings by limiting the judge's ability to find out

7

what the defendant exactly did.

8

QUESTION:

Right.

He says, you know, you'd

better tell me what you did.

I don't know that there's a

factual basis for this plea.

QUESTION:

May I ask you, on the facts of this

case, where the woman said, I want to contest the amount,

7

and that implied to the judge she probably would be going

8

to get on the stand and testify, supposing at the

9

sentencing hearing the probation -- the pre-sentence

10

report said, we've looked at the evidence as best we can,

11

we thought we had some reliable witnesses who would

12

testify to X amount of drugs, but our witnesses don't

13

stand up, we don't know what the amount was.

14

Now, is it your view that the prosecutor could

15

say, well, we can't prove it, but we'd like to put her on

16

the stand and cross-examine her and see if we can't get

17

her to admit it?

18

I think that's your view.

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

That -- the waiver analysis

19

that we have put forward suggests that at least as to the

facts surrounding the conspiracy to which she admitted,

21

the Government could do that, or -- and the court could

ask her to testify.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

The judge could very well

Well, that's right.

So the Government -- you don't lose a

10

lot if you don't -- if you are not able to draw the

11

negative inference, because you still have the affirmative

12

evidence of amount on which you can still rely.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

That's true.

I -- the Government

came to this sentencing prepared to prove up the facts

that supported the sentence.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

It gives the defendant an

2

incentive to conceal and minimize his own criminal

3

conduct, so instead of the defendant coming into court and

4

being willing to make a fair statement of what he actually

5

did, you can envision a defendant thinking quite carefully

with counsel about what to admit and what to attempt to

7

get by.
QUESTION:

All right, you know -- you may or may

It's just a factual, empirical matter, but

10

it still comes as a little bit of a surprise to me that

11

many defendants, when asked by the judge at the sentencing

12

hearing as to a contested matter what their side of the

13

story was, would say, I'm not going to tell you.

14

does that happen very often?

Why do you think that?

that particular piece of evidence that may be relevant

both to the crime and sentencing.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, to a judge accurately informing a

defendant of more consequences of a guilty plea than are

7

required by the current version of Rule 11.

QUESTION:

Well, he's simply making explicit to

a lay person what in fact is being done.

I mean, the

10

reason for the Boykin hearing is to make sure the

11

defendant who is not a lawyer knows what the consequences

12

will be, and all you're doing if you add the reference to

13

waiver as to sentencing hearing is just being complete,

14

whereas under the colloquy that took place in this case it

15

was not totally complete on your view.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Souter, that

17

amendment of Rule 11, or the Rule 11 colloquy, is

18

consistent with our position that that's the effect of the

19

guilty plea.

20

The Rule 11 in its -- colloquy in its current

form should not drive the constitutional conclusion that

this Court reaches.

conduct that is subsumed in the count of conviction, then

QUESTION:

But that wasn't this one, apparently, and under

7

those circumstances, I guess a prosecutor could say to the

defendant, we're not going to take a plea unless the plea

makes clear that at sentencing it's a waiver of any Fifth

10

Amendment privilege that you might want to assert at

11

sentencing as well.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true --

I mean, a prosecutor could do that.
That's true, Justice O'Connor, and

a defendant could similarly say, I want to enter a plea of

guilty, but I want the Government to agree that it will

shoulder the load at sentencing.

Is it entirely consensual?

I mean,

2

if the petitioner is right that where you deal separately

3

with the elements of a crime, you've pleaded guilty, you

waive the plea there, but you don't with respect to

sentencing, then can -- could either the prosecutor or the

further waiver without being charged with burdening the

privilege against self-incrimination such as we've said in

some other cases?

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, the claim

11

would be made -- my response would be that a prosecutor

12

can exert considerable pressure on a defendant to waive

13

all sorts of constitutional rights in the course of a

14

guilty plea, and to give up statutory rights as well, and

15

there's nothing inherently unconstitutional in a procedure

16

in which there is that kind of give-and-take, so I don't

17

think that affirming the view that petitioner has put

18

forward would preclude the Government from trying to vary

19

it by contract.

■>

20

But by the same token, if I am correct that the

21

plea does constitute a waiver, nothing would prohibit a

22

defendant from coming in to the prosecutor and saying, I

23

am willing to plead guilty and spare you a trial.

24

have a contest about the sentencing facts, and I think

25

that if you've got the evidence you ought to put it on.

QUESTION:

So then the Fifth Amendment privilege

would have been retained at the sentencing.
MR. DREEBEN:

I think that it's possible to

7

conclude that it would have been retained, at least on the

8

theory that we have articulated before the Court today.

9

Alford pleas are so anomalous in the standard

10

run of guilty pleas that it's tricky to say exactly what

11

they are, but the normal guilty plea unquestionably is a

12

full-fledged waiver of the privilege against compelled

13

self-incrimination.

14

Indeed, it is self-incrimination, and we simply

15

take the view that once one comes forward to the court to

16

do that, you cannot withhold the details of the offense to

17

which you have pleaded guilty.

QUESTION:

Are you -- is your position different

19

from Judge Slovener, because as I recall she didn't put

20

Rule 11 into her analysis at all.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that

22

the Third Circuit went back and forth between two

23

different rationales.

24

guilty plea analysis that we have stretched out in this

25

Court to articulate more factors.

One rationale begins with the

1

The other part of the Third Circuit's rationale

2

seems to be the notion that there is no privilege against

3

self-incrimination with respect to facts that can serve to

4

enhance your sentence.

5

The logical implication of that position is

6

broader than the position that we've taken in this Court.

7

The logical implication of that position is that a

8

defendant who goes to trial and does not take the stand

9

and is convicted would then forfeit any Fifth Amendment

10
11

privilege with respect to the criminal sentencing.
The Third Circuit didn't have to confront that

12

situation, and I do not know what the Third Circuit would

13

have answered to that question, but there are enough

14

elements in the Third Circuit decision that are consistent

15

with our position, so I think it's fair to say that this

16

was and is a guilty plea case.
