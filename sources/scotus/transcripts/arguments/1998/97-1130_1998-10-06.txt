ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY R. SELINGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SELINGER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Federal Circuit held that Wayne Pfaff had

12

forfeited his right to a patent because he had violated

13

the on-sale bar provision.

14

that conclusion because it failed to construe the statute

15

properly.

16

sale bar provision cannot start until there is an

17

invention fully completed by reduction to practice.

18

The appellate court reached

Properly construed, the grace period of the on

There are three reasons why the statute should

19

be so construed.

20

appellate circuits consistently had construed the on sale

21

bar provision to require at least reduction to practice.

22

That body of judicial authority spans two relevant

23

reenactments of the on sale bar provision.

24
25

First, for many decades the regional

Second, the policy balance selected by Congress
in 1839 for the on sale bar provision emphasized that

inventors were to have an easy to calculate period of

inventors.

MR. SELINGER:

-- do you think that an invention has

to be reduced to practice in order to get a patent?
MR. SELINGER:

9

Mr. Selinger --

An invention has to be reduced to

practice -- the answer is yes, Your Honor, either
through -QUESTION:

11

Yes?

You know, this may reflect a

12

fundamental misunderstanding on my part, which could be

13

the case.

14

one could patent an invention based on drawings and plans

15

and descriptions sufficiently clear to enable one to make

16

it, and I had thought, without ever producing the item,

17

one could take those things to the patent office and

18

secure a patent.

19

I'm not an expert on patent law.

I had thought

Is that wrong?

MR. SELINGER:

The Court in Dolbear recognized

20

that one could have a constructive reduction to practice

21

by the filing of a patent application that met the

22

standards of disclosure in 112 in novelty, in 102 in

23

nonobviousness, in 103 --

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. SELINGER:

Honor.

11

The -QUESTION:

10

The -- the answer is yes, Your

Why shouldn't it turn on

patentability rather than reduction to practice?
MR. SELINGER:

12

The reason it should not, Your

13

Honor, is because the statute says the invention was on

14

sale.

15

It doesn't say the invention was conceived.
Going back to the Alexander Milburn case, about

16

half-way through that decision the Court made it clear

17

that the person who had described in his patent but not

18

claimed was not in fact the inventor for the description

19

purpose, and the answer is, in going on just further,

20

conception is always the first step, but as this Court has

21

said in a number of cases going back to Corona Cord,

22

Symington, and starting back in earlier cases, conception

23

is the first step, reduction to practice is when you show

24

that something really will work.

Well, but I agree with the inference

1

at least I draw from Justice O'Connor's question, if there

2

is enough information to secure a patent, and if he finds

3

a willing buyer for 30,000 units, what purpose is served

4

by adding the arbitrary requirement that it be reduced to

5

practice, other than to extend the 17-year period plus 1?

6

I just don't see the purpose of that.

7

MR. SELINGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, to --

Other than to extend the life of the

patent.
MR. SELINGER:

10

Well, to understand the purpose I

11

think we need to go back briefly through the history, Your

12

Honor, and the Patent Act of 1793 as construed by this

13

Court in Pennock v. Dialogue provided no grace period in

14

that an application had to be filed before there was

15

public use or public sale for use.

16

That situation lasted legislatively for only 3

17

years, from 1836 to 1839, when Congress created a 2-year

18

grace period, and this Court in Andrews v. Hovey then

19

explained that the evident purpose of Congress was

20

twofold.

21

One point is to create a period of limitations

22

which should be certain.

23

rights.

24

and the court in Andrews emphasized that there should be a

25

clear line.

We're dealing with forfeiture of property rights,

MR. SELINGER:

Why isn't that a clear

Well, Your Honor, when you have a

conception, you have a piece of paper -QUESTION:

7

I have the written description that I

8

can walk right down to the Patent Office and get my patent

9

on it.

Anybody can make it based on that description, and

10

I enter into an agreement that, based on that plan, on

11

date X I'm going to deliver these items to you.

I haven't

12

made them yet, but I'm going to do it on date X.

Is that

13

a sale?

MR. SELINGER:

QUESTION:

16

MR. SELINGER:

QUESTION:

18

MR. SELINGER:

No.

No?
It'S not.

It's a contract for sale.
It's a contract to deliver

something that may exist in the future, something that may

20

or may not actually work when you go from conception to

21

reduction to practice.

22

the 1800's and into the 1900's, has required both

conception and reduction to practice.

QUESTION:

The

You can't get a patent

No, you cannot.

But when you have something that you

6

can bring down to the patent office and get it registered,

7

then you have an invention, don't you?
MR. SELINGER:

8

9

Honor.

You have -- you do not, Your

You have an invention either when you actually

10

build and test and make sure the device will work for its

11

intended purpose, or when you file your patent application

12

with claims, in which case you have constructive reduction

13

to practice.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't -- the word

15

constructive is really not helpful at all, because it says

16

you haven't reduced it to practice. You have the drawings,

17

as Justice O'Connor described.

18

somebody could copy it, somebody knowledgeable in the art,

19

but constructive really doesn't help.

20

constructive means you didn't construct it.

21

means that you have no reduction to practice, so let's

22

just deal with that.

It's precise enough that

QUESTION:

-- suppose we just pick that up.

Is

there anything

wrong with the following rule? I take

13

there might be

some confusion because to get a patent you

14

have to show that the thing is useful, novel, and

Then it's patentable.

MR. SELINGER:

That's correct.

All right.

But then there's an

additional requirement that the Patent Office has put in.
The additional requirement is, a) you've reduced

it to practice, or b) you haven't reduced it to practice

21

but you've written it down in such detail that a

knowledgeable person could reduce it to practice, so we

MR. SELINGER:

That's where I

I think the first part is

correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Wait I'll get his exact words.

It

6

says, the invention has been reduced to practice, or the

7

invention is described sufficiently in the application to

8

satisfy the written description requirement and to enable

9

a skilled artisan to practice the invention.

Now, I must

10

have -- I've read correctly, I think, what he said, and so

11

you have to have a rather detailed written description, is

12

that right?

13

MR. SELINGER:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SELINGER:

For con -- for the application.

In order to get the patent.
That's correct.

Now, what would

16

be wrong with curing -- all the bars are telling us is

17

vagueness on the part of the Federal Circuit by just

18

saying, that's what you have to have, what I just read.

19

In other words, the time period starts to run

20

when you satisfy the three conditions and either you have

21

reduced it to practice or you have written it down in such

22

detail that a skilled artisan would be able to practice

23

the invention.

brief, right into the opinion, and say that's what you

I'm asking the question.

reduce it to practice, but it surely follows the idea that

Your client

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, in addition to the

patentability, public use or on sale.

16

MR. SELINGER:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's why I asked you about the

18

contract for sale, but you say a contract for sale isn't a

19

sale.

20

MR. SELINGER:

For purpose -- in the absence of

21

a completed device, Your Honor, a contract alone is

22

irrelevant.

23

Returning to Your Honor's question, the second

24

answer is, the suggestion from the Solicitor General I

25

think is superficially clear but is very complicated and

1

does not create a bright line test in practice.
The third problem it has is, it creates a huge

2

3

reservoir of secret prior art usable against third

4

parties, and I think the fourth reason is that it subverts

5

the public interest.
Let me go back to those.

6

It's theoretically-

7

interesting to explain that when you have a piece of paper

8

and you actually describe something that ought to start

9

the clock.

10

The problem is that may not be what you end up

with as a real product.

11

I may think I'm 6 months from developing a new

12

fuel additive which will reduce pollution by 50 percent,

13

and if I'm a small company I can then -- I may want to

14

enter into a distribution contract with a large company to

15

get that into the market, but I may be wrong.

16

me, and I may be able to write the details of that

17

additive ad nauseam, but it may turn out, when I actually

18

get my trials, when I actually try to see if it works for

19

its intended purpose, it doesn't, and I've got to go back

to the laboratory.

that's short of a sale, an option, or something like that.

2

MR. SELINGER:

3

QUESTION:

Your Honor, the risk --

I guess what I'm asking is, could we

4

avoid the difficulties you mention by just putting the

5

burden on the would-be patent holder to draw the contract

6

documents correctly?

7

MR. SELINGER:

I think it would be contrary to

8

public interest to tell patentees that not only could they

9

be in breach of contract but they would risk losing their

10

patent rights if their contract wasn't drafted carefully.

11
12

QUESTION:

But that's missing -- Judge Bryson's

formulation addresses that, doesn't it?

13

MR. SELINGER:

14

QUESTION:

It does indeed.

Why isn't his formulation then sort

15

of a good answer to your answer to Justice Breyer's

16

suggestion?

17

or make obvious what later eventuates is the invention,

18

that would suffice, what's wrong with that?

19

If what he wrote is sufficient to anticipate,

MR. SELINGER:

What's wrong with that, Your

20

Honor, are exactly the problems I was explaining to His

21

Honor, and there are four problems.

22

Solicitor General is promoting Judge Bryson's test, and

23

the problems are that it's not a bright line test because

1

get to one, but I -- you were specifically saying -- in

2

response to Justice Breyer you're saying, well, the

3

problem with the Solicitor General's test is that what I

4

agree to sell when I'm still in perhaps in a stage of

5

development, whether I think so or not, may turn out to be

6

something different from what I actually sell after I've

7

tested my product 6 months later, and the Bryson

8

formulation does address that problem.

9

MR. SELINGER:

Your Honor, I have to disagree,

10

and to the extent that the Bryson formulation purports to,

11

it does so years after the fact, and it requires looking

12

at what was offered for sale.

13

not the Bryson formula requires anything to exist,

14

something as broad as, I offer to sell you my new cure for

15

arthritis.

It's not clear whether or

Whether that starts the clock --

Your point is that the inventor has

18

to know right away whether he has a year left or not.

19

MR. SELINGER:

20

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

It's not good enough that you can

21

tell clearly 3 years later that he then had a year left.

22

He has to know it now.

MR. SELINGER:

24

QUESTION:

Why aren't we focusing on -- I mean,

we're focusing on the word invention.

the word sale?

Wouldn't the problem be solved if a sale

2

does not include a contract to sell, and if it includes

3

only the delivery of the actual working product?
MR. SELINGER:

4

For many years, Your Honor, the

5

on-hand test was part of the on sale bar provision in a

6

number of circuits, and that was in fact the situation.

7

The product had to be on hand before the on sale bar could

8

start to run.

9

That wasn't the rule in all circuits, but every

10

circuit that considered the on sale bar required at least

11

reduction to practice.
QUESTION:

12

Why can't we go down that road?

I

13

mean, I think it's a reasonable use of the word -- I mean,

14

the law in some situations draws a distinction between a

15

sale and a contract to sell.

16

QUESTION:

17

words on sale mean?

18

sale is actually consummated?

But the question is, what do the

A product can be on sale under

the law without there actually being a sale if there is a

22

In fact, part of the purpose of the on sale

provision is to allow inventors to test the salability of

the product after they have it, and something that doesn't

QUESTION:

Okay.

So you really do not argue for

the position that there's got to be a consummated sale as

If I may just go back to the

fourth point, as Judge Easterbrook noted, sitting as the

district court in the Mahurkar case, as the dissents noted

in UMC and Atlantic Thermoplastics, it's very common --

it's important for inventors to communicate with

customers.
This not only helps during the inventive process

11

of making the best product, getting a better product to

12

the public, but it also allows inventors, as I was

describing earlier, to get the product there sooner rather

than later, and it's in the public interest to allow

inventors to communicate with prospective customers.

prospectively, but going back to my earlier comment, Your

2

Honor, what that would do is place inventors not only at

3

risk of breach of contract if they didn't act timely, but

4

if the contract wasn't done properly, based on the court's

new ruling, inventors would be also faced with the risk of

the loss of their invention, their patentable invention,

product had been made more than 1 year before the patent

inventive process, because in the course of trying to

make changes.

that has been

1

Once the invention is in place, we encourage the

2

inventors to file their patent application, and that

3

fundamental policy was noted in Bonito Boats, and it is

4

exactly why the on sale bar, the on sale portion of the on

5

sale bar should not be read to allow the inventor to

6

control the time when the period starts to run by deciding

7

when he or she will reduce it to practice, or he or she

8

will deliver the goods.

9

You have run counter to that fundamental

10

policy -- let me suggest that the entire reduction to

11

practice notion is a notion that has grown up not in the

12

on sale bar clause area at all.

13

We have two major categories of conditions when

14

you look at 102.

15

call priority, because it says, let's look at the time of

16

invention and decide at that point in time what was the

17

state of the art, what was already out there?

18

something novel, or was it already there?

19

look at in 102(a), that's what we look at in 102(b),

20

that's what we look at in 102(g).

21

The first category of condition let's

Is this

That's what we

In the priority cases, the way the law has

22

developed, and it's developed appropriately, I think, we

23

definitely have, as the question to establish this

morning, we look at when the invention was made in terms

25

of when was the conception complete?

that at least since the middle of the last century.

2

So when we're asking that question, we

encourage, of course inventors to remember as well as they

4

this Court has always been, and other courts have been

properly skeptical of the mere memory of the inventor as

to how far back he actually thought through this

So the courts developed this notion of a

reduction to practice, and the reduction to practice helps

11

confirm as a matter of proof that not only was there a

12

conception, but that within a reasonable time -- this is

13

the notion of diligence to reduce to practice.

fairly certain that in the process of reducing to practice

he's going to have to make some changes in the basic

MR. BAIN:

Or does he make an R&D contract or

It's easy to handle by contract,

I want to point out

what?

5
6

Well, number 1,

is

the short answer.

7

But I want to point out that it's very rare when

8

you're going to get a contract -- I think relatively rare,

9

anyway, when you're going to get a contract that describes

10

the invention.
Remember the invention,

11

let's think of it in

12

terms of a combination of A, B, C, and D.

13

combination of those elements.

14

you don't normally sell things in terms,

15

you a combination of A, B,

16

that performs X function and Y function,

17

you have a contract that simply says I'm going to sell you

18

a device that performs X function or Y function --

That's your invention,

C, and D.

QUESTION:

I agree.

MR. BAIN:

Yes.

It's a

I want to sell

You sell something
and that, when

That's the very problem I

have.
Then I would say you do not

22

have a contract that puts the invention on sale.

in your example you don't know what the invention is yet,

24

because the invention is what you finally settle on, but

you said you're going to probably change it as you go

With all due respect, Your Honor,

most of the inventions today in our more complex world are

little pieces of products.

7

They're not whole products.

This happened to be a whole product, but most of

8

the time it's little pieces of product, and we buy

inventions in them.

will they do for us, not do they have element A, B, and C,

12

in this part.

QUESTION:

When we buy them, we are buying what

So is that the answer to what -- to

14

what I thought the colleague petitioner I think responded

15

to my question.

16

my mind, that a company goes and shows a business -- an

17

inventor a very, very complicated computer and says, we

18

need some little part in here, and although that sounds

19

easy, it's very difficult, and the inventor says, I know I

20

can invent it.

You put this -- exactly this subject in

That's not a problem.

I mean, it will be this way roughly, and they

21

22

describe it in fairly good detail but not in such detail

23

that you could go make it right then and there, and so

24

they sign a contract for it expecting it will take 2 or 3

25

years.

Now the time begins to pass, and the inventor

1

tries 50 different things.

3

that, and he isn't quite certain which is the best.

4

You know, first this, first

Now, may 40 of those 50 would qualify as

5

inventions once he's written them down, but he isn't going

to go actually make it until he's sure he's got the best

one.
Now, what's he supposed to do?

Is he supposed

to, under your rule -- and this may be fairly common.

Is

10

he, every time he's written out a description of something

11

in detail that would count as the invention, which, by the

12

way, he'll get something better 3 days later, it's never

13

going to be reduced to practice.

14

Does he then have to go and file a patent

15

application immediately, possibly having hundreds of

16

patent applications, just because it may turn out he's got

17

the best one and he doesn't really know for 3 or 4 years,

18

and that's why he hasn't reduced it to practice.

still working on this.

He's

that question.

is, when am I ready to patent my invention?

We are asking for the test that we think

decide to go for a patent, so in your example the inventor

would have to say to himself, do I have an invention yet

2

that I am ready to go for patent on, and is it going to

3

get incorporated into this product?

4

If it does so, and if he has a sale, then he

5

knows with certainty that the clock is starting to run on

6

his 1-year grace period, and he then has a full year to

7

get his patent application filed.

I'm really confused, because as I

understood Justice Breyer's hypothetical there had to have
been a sale anyway, according to you.

MR. BAIN:

I'm sorry, I misunderstood that --

Well --

MR. BAIN:

You need both elements.

-- all he agreed to do was to devise

this little gimmick for the computer.

MR. BAIN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You know, I want -- he didn't say how

18

he was going to devise -- I think he would have said there

19

was no sale.

20

MR. BAIN:

I'm very sorry, I would have said --

21

and I missed that point.

22

clear, and that is, there's a slight difference between

23

the test that the Solicitor General has -- suggests and

24

the test that we suggest.

25

I want to make one little point

We suggest the ready-for-patenting test, and so

1

ours is a prospective test, and so when the invention is

2

ready for patenting and on sale both the period starts to

3

run, as opposed to the Solicitor General test, which is a

4

retrospective test, as I understand it, although he can

5

certainly speak for himself, but that's a retrospective

6

test, so after the fact you look back and say, well, in

7

fact, was what turned out to be the invention on sale more

8

than

year in advance.

9

There's a slight difference, and it only makes a

10

difference in those cases I think close to the example you

11

had where the invention really isn't complete yet the full

12

year before the filing for patent, we really don't have an

3

invention yet, but if we just do the pure retrospective

4

test, you may not get your full year.

5

And that's the reason we believe that the ready-

6

for-patenting test is a superior test, and should be

7

applied by the Court, and we believe that's a test which

8

brings a very substantial amount of certainty, and

9

certainly we don't believe that reduction to practice

20

brings a large quantity of certainty.

21

There will always be uncertainty, because we

22

will always have mixed fact patterns, but reduction to

practice --

you gave earlier?

You must have at least an offer for sale that

QUESTION:

But I mean, it seems to me that if we

accept your definition there aren't going to be many

sales, because many -- I assume there are not going to be

11

very many sales contracts that in fact are going to go

12

into detail in specifying elements A, B, and C, or

13

whatever they are, so that would seem to me to reduce the

14

bar to such a narrow limit in its application that it's

15

unlikely that Congress would have assumed such a narrow

16

definition.

17

MR. BAIN:

Well, I think that it still remains a

18

very important bar, but the fact is that the way sales are

19

made, very often the buyer does not in fact know what's

person, the inventor who keeps having 50 different things

2

over the period of 2 or 3 years to see which is the best.

3

And I think what Justice Scalia was saying, if

4

the sale contract which took place before this process

5

began described in very great detail exactly what this

6

particular thing that was to be invented would do, but

7

still left it open as to which of 50 different possible

8

inventions would satisfy that, there wouldn't be a sale.

9

Rather, for there to be a sale you'd have to

10

refer absolutely explicitly to the particular invention

11

that we're talking about, which means to say you can't get

12

into the position of selling the thing in advance before

13

it's invented.

Our view is simply this, that

section 102(b), when it uses the term invention, is

20

referring to the item, the product that is identified in

product that is offered for sale is the same product

that's identified in the patent application.

a physical embodiment of the invention, that test will be

2

very easy to apply.

3

We think it's also easy to apply --

4

QUESTION:

Well, is this a prospective test, or

5

a retrospective test, because I still am not sure of the

6

answer to the question.

7

MR. MINEAR:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, I think -If we don't know quite what it's

going to look like, we later know retrospectively that you

10

did sell the invention, but we don't know prospectively

11

that you did.
MR. MINEAR:

12

Justice Kennedy, I'd like to answer

13

your question from two perspectives.

14

what the inventor understands under our test, and that is,

15

if he has conceived of an invention, if he's ready to

16

patent it, then he knows he has 1 year from the date he

17

places it on sale to apply for that patent, and that's a

18

clear rule for him.

19

Let's look first at

He knows at that point that once I say, Eureka,

20

I know what I want to do here, I understand it, I can

21

reduce it to practice, I can make an enabling disclosure,

22

then he knows if he offers it for sale the clock is

23

ticking, and he has 1 year to get that patent application

24

in.

25

Now, the case is also going to arise, in the

1

case such as we have here, where a party is seeking to

2

invalidate the patent -- and his perspective is going to

3

be quite different on it.

4

proof do I have that the inventor had placed this item on

5

sale, and it really is an evidentiary question at that

6

point in terms of whether what was on sale was what was

7

ultimately identified in the patent.

He's going to look at what

For instance, a simple case of this is the

8

mechanical drawing situation we have here.

We think this

10

case is clearly covered by our test.

11

says is, look, we know this was on sale because the

12

engineering diagrams that you prepared and submitted to

13

the purchaser are the very same diagrams that we submitted

14

with the application of a patent.

15

What the challenger

Now, the question that you're concerned with, I

16

believe, is the situation of, well, what if there's a

17

change along the way as the product is developed, and

18

certainly that's commonplace in today's commercial

1

markets, that there'd be the back-and-forth, the

20

interchange between the buyer and seller that might lead

21

to modifications of the product.

22

If it's an obvious change, then the same bar

23

applies.

24

to the item that was originally offered for sale.

there's going to be a change along the way?

know whether his year clock is ticking or not?

7

way or not.
MR. MINEAR:

8

9

You're looking at

I'm concerned from the standpoint of
How does he know whether
How does he
He can't

Well, the inventor should know

whether or not he has an invention, whether or not he's

10

prepared to submit a patent application and, if he is,

11

then he knows if he puts it on sale the clock is going to

12

be running.

13

better, or to improve it.

QUESTION:

In that case the clock might

be, subject to anticipation in light of his original

application, he's filed an original application, so he's

covered there.

24

following your rule, he will file a new application.

If the change is radical, then he knows

rules operate, and it's important to see that this is --

describe as a half-baked idea.

for sale, but he hasn't fully formulated in that

9

situation.

10

He's offering something

Now, the inventor that does that runs a risk

11

that someone might say that, well, in fact, you knew what

12

you were selling, and the on sale bar should apply.

13

He can protect himself in that situation simply

14

by providing in the terms of the contract that he is

15

providing development services, or an R&D contract, or

16

he's entering into a joint ventureship with the party for

17

whom he's developing this.

who has a half-baked idea say that?

MR. MINEAR:

3

Because that's not the only thing

4

that's operating in this marketplace.

The inventor also

5

has to be concerned about the possibility that other

6

inventors might come along to claim the same invention.
Now, if he wants to protect himself and protect

his priority, then he's going to need to do one of several

things.

) he's going to have to actually reduce to

10

practice -- there is this incentive to encourage people to

11

reduce to practice -- or he's going to file a patent

12

application ahead of time.

3

The marketplace itself actually polices this in

4

very important ways, because the inventor, if he wants to

5

take advantage of the patent system, he does have to move

6

quickly and clarify what he's selling.

7

What's more, the marketplace also encourages the

8

proper use of our tests because, as you said, Justice

9

Scalia, a buyer is not going to buy a pig in a poke.

He's

20

going to want to know what he's bought.

21

want a description, much as Wells wanted -- or not Wells,

22

excuse me, the Texas Instrument wanted in this case.

23

did want to see a diagram of what was being sold, and

24

their contract specified they wanted the product that they

25

saw in the diagram.

QUESTION:

10

And your rules say, embodies the

invention, does the sale embody the invention, right?

9

Sure.

That is correct.
Okay.

Now, I take it that rules out

the possibility where the invention isn't yet invented, so
it doesn't include contracts to develop anything.

11

MR. MINEAR:

That is correct.

12

QUESTION:

13

Now, the invention is there if the three basic

The invention must be there.

14

nonobviousnesses are satisfied, and if it's reduced to

practice, but if it's not reduced to practice, it's still

there if there is a very written description in detail

I think certainly -And if neither are those two things

That's what their complaint is,

response to that third part of your alternative test there
as to why it isn't uncertain.

MR. MINEAR:

already exist.

QUESTION:

How is that an improvement over what

the Federal Circuit's doing that every part of the bar is

MR. MINEAR:

We think it is an improvement,

inventor on clear notice of exactly what the test is.

The problem we see with the Federal Circuit's
