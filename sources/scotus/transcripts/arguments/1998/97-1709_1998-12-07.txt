ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH P. H. BABINGTON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. BABINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:
We are here today because the circuit court

12

unduly restricted the district court's evaluation of the

13

reliability of certain expert testimony offered by

14

respondents.

15

court from considering the reliability factors set forth

16

in this Court's decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow.

17

The Eleventh Circuit barred the district

If permitted to stand,

the Eleventh Circuit's

18

decision would allow experts to escape scrutiny under the

19

reliability factors merely by invoking experience in some

20

broad sense as a basis for testimony.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

At some point during your argument --

I just am troubled by this, and wish you would address it.
It sounded to me as if your expert,

the defense

24

expert, used just about the same methodology as the

25

plaintiff's expert.

He talked about over-deflected

operation because of severe beading, groove compressions,

the discoloration on the side,

waiver, or estoppel, or stipulation, but it seems to me

that this is what your expert was talking about,

argument,

7

and I don't know if it's

too, and

Just during the course of your

if you could mention that.
MR. BABINGTON:

Justice Kennedy, we disagree

8

with that interpretation of the record.

First,

the -- it

9

it is clear that the petitioners' expert physically

10

examined the tire before he issued his report.

11

respondents'

12

containing his conclusion before conducting any physical

13

examination of the tire.

14

expert, by contrast,

In addition,

The

issued his report

there was a completely different

15

methodology that was used,

16

troubled the district court.

17

respondents' expert was a process of elimination,

18

thumb methodology that we pointed out in our briefs,

19

by contrast, our expert used a methodology that asked very

20

broadly, what are the causes, why did this tire come out

21

of service, and in asking that looked at all of the

22

evidence and did not limit his consideration of the

23

evidence just to eliminating certain factors of abuse.

24
25

QUESTION:

and that's what troubled, most
The methodology used by the
rule of
and

The principal attack in the briefs,

as I understood it, on the plaintiff's expert was that he

1

had these four factors.

2

there are four and any two are present, then I'll make one

3

conclusion, and you may argue about that, but so far as

4

the factors that he uses, i.e., the discoloration, the

5

beading, et cetera, they were the same, were they not, as

6

your own expert?

7

MR. BABINGTON:

Now, I recognize that he said, if

They looked for the same

8

evidence on the tire in some respects.

9

expert, of course, limited his consideration, did not look

10

The respondents'

for particularly affirmative evidence of defect.
But the major difference was the way that

11
12

they -- the method that they applied to get from what they

13

saw on the tire to their ultimate conclusion in the case,

14

and our point is that a district court, in evaluating the

15

reliability of expert testimony offered by parties before

16

a court should not be prohibited from considering the

17

logical, common sense questions that flow out of this

18

Court's Daubert factors, broadly understood.

19

The lower courts have applied and understood the

20

Daubert factors in a flexible, broad manner, as this Court

21

intended.

22

QUESTION:

Well now, let me ask you something.

23

The Eleventh Circuit apparently reviewed the decision of

24

the trial court to apply the Daubert standard de novo.

25

The Eleventh Circuit looked at that de novo, said it was a

1

question of law and it would look at it de novo, but I

2

think acknowledged that the ultimate decision of the

3

district court whether to exclude the evidence should be

4

reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard.
Now,

5

I'm a little confused.

What is the

6

standard we should apply to this question that you present

7

us with here?

8

it under an abuse of discretion standard?

Do we look at it de novo, or do we look at

MR. BABINGTON:

9

The standard of review of the

10

Eleventh Circuit's holdings that were the basis for its

11

decision should be reviewed de novo.
The Eleventh Circuit made two errors of law.

12

13

First,

it crafted this experience exception that I was

14

discussing, which is that if an expert invokes

15

experience -QUESTION:

16

Well,

let me back up,

then.

What

17

standard of review should the Eleventh Circuit have

18

applied,

19

combination of the two?

abuse of discretion, or some de novo review, or a

MR. BABINGTON:

20

Well,

I think it would be a

21

combination.

22

applied,

23

Eleventh Circuit erred in how it interpreted this Court's

24

Daubert decision.

25

Certainly as to the standard that should be

that's a question of law.

Our point is that the

In footnote 8 in Daubert, this Court said, our

1

discussion is limited to the scientific context, because

2

that was what was before the Court.
QUESTION:

3

Well, certainly Daubert itself

4

indicated that it was dealing there with some kind of

5

scientific evidence, and it didn't purport to establish

6

some global principles of the four factors in every case,

7

did it?
MR. BABINGTON:

8

9

Well,

the -- what we contend the

Court did in Daubert was to set forth general, broad,

10

common sense criteria that courts can use to determine the

11

reliability of a broad range of expert testimony.
QUESTION:

12

Well, there's a lot of discussion

13

about whether we should look to a standard that directs

14

the trial judge's attention to indicia of reliability in

15

the field at issue.

16

issue in the field that is recognized as legitimate for an

17

inquiry?

18

Now,

I mean, what is it regarding this

is there anything in this record to show

19

that the district court made any findings on the indicia

20

of reliability that prevail in the tire manufacturing

21

field?

22

MR. BABINGTON:

Yes.

If you look at the

23

district court's opinion on reconsideration,

24

specifically discussed in the joint appendix at pages 91

25

and 92.

(800) FOR DEPO

I think it's

1

The district court considered the respondents'

2

argument that the respondents' expert did the same thing

3

as the petitioners' expert, and that there was evidence in

4

the record that supported the view that what the

5

respondents' expert did was commonly accepted.

6

did it this way.

Everyone

And the district court specifically rejected

7
8

that, saying that the evidence before the court did not

9

establish that.

At most, all it established was that the

10

two experts used the same method of -- or technique of

11

gathering data, and that's really not that surprising.

12

You should look first to the product in question to gather

13

your data.

14

What most troubled the district court was the

15

methodology, how the experts got from the information on

16

which they were basing their opinion to their ultimate

17

conclusion, and as this Court pointed out in Joiner, the

18

ipse dixit of the expert is insufficient to support the

19

ultimate conclusion.

20

There must be some objective validation or

21

criteria that the district court can look to.

22

the district court otherwise know that the expert's not

23

just making it up, and that's really the point of our

24

argument, that the district court, in answering that

25

central question, should be allowed to ask the logical,

How does

1

common sense questions that flow out of this Court's

2

Daubert criteria.

3

QUESTION:

Well, does the record show the

4

district court looked at anything other than the four

5

Daubert factors?
MR. BABINGTON:

6

Absolutely.

What the district

7

court did was consider the fact, the logical flaws in the

8

respondents' expert's approach.

9

For example, that even though he had a

10

methodology, he didn't even apply the methodology in this

11

case.

12

looked at photographs of the tire, and he admitted that he

13

didn't know whether his past analyses of failed tires had

14

ever been correct.

Instead of physically examining the tire first, he

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Babington, there's circulating

16

now a proposed revision of Rule 702, and that is set forth

17

in the appendix to the respondents' brief.

18

are three things to look at, 1) the reliability of the

19

facts, the reliability of the principles and method, and

20

finally the reliability of the application.

21

It says there

Would you think that that's an adequate

22

statement?

You tell us that the Eleventh Circuit is no

23

good because they removed all of the standards.

24

on the other hand, has these four factors, and the

25

district court did organize its decision under those.

Daubert,

But suppose we had, instead -- suppose the

1
2

district court or the Eleventh Circuit had said, Daubert

3

is too rigid, we like these standards, would that be

4

acceptable?
MR. BABINGTON:

5

Well, we think that the proposed

6

rule merely is an attempt to put down more clearly the

7

existing law, is what I understand that the advisory

8

committee is attempting to do.

9

hasn't been acted on yet.

It is a mere proposal.

10

But that standard is an effort by the advisory

11

committee to put down in the rules what the lower courts

12

have thought about how they should assess reliability of

13

expert testimony following this Court's landmark Daubert

14

decision, and under the new rule, or under the -- so to

15

answer your question, the answer really wouldn't be any

16

different.

17

It

The Daubert criteria, broadly understood and

18

flexibly applied, lead to exactly the type of questions

19

that the district court asked of this expert to determine

20

if his testimony was more than just his say-so, more than

21

just guesswork or speculation.

22

QUESTION:

What you are saying, Mr. Babington, I

23

take it, is that the Daubert opinion dealt with kind of

24

scientific peer review type of evidence, but that the

25

gatekeeper function extends beyond that to anything

1

covered by Rule 702 when it's dealing with expert

2

evidence.

3

MR. BABINGTON:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

4

Justice.

5

gatekeeper function applies to any expert offered under

6

Rule 702.

7

General agrees with that.

8

seriously question that.

9

We are saying that it's clear that the

The respondents agree with that.

QUESTION:

The Solicitor

I don't think any of the amici
That's very clear.

Well, you're contending more than

10

that.

You're contending, as well, that the Daubert

11

factors can be applied to any expert testimony.

12

MR. BABINGTON:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

What we're --

Are broadly applicable to any expert

testimony, not exclusive, but broadly applicable.
MR. BABINGTON:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

16

What we are saying is that the gatekeeper function

17

definitely applies to all experts, and then in how the

18

judge exercises his gatekeeper function to determine

19

whether there is a reliable foundation for the expert

20

testimony that's been proffered involves his asking of

21

questions such as those that logically flow out of the

22

Daubert factors.

23

QUESTION:

Not all.

Not all would do that.

I

24

mean, wouldn't it depend on whether the shoe fits?

25

mean, why couldn't you have an expert in painting, a great

magenta.

I don't even know what magenta is.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

And you say, how do you know?

How do

5

you know?

He says, I've looked at 50,000 paintings.

6

Believe me, I work for the Philadelphia Museum of Art,

7

I've looked at so many, I know.

8

wouldn't apply Daubert factors in such a case.

I recognize it.

You

9

I mean, isn't it Daubert factors where they

10

belong, when you're trying a general theory, and some

11

other thing where it's not?

12

MR. BABINGTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BABINGTON:

15

Justice Breyer --

Is that right, or not?
Justice Breyer, we agree that

the Daubert factors can be flexibly applied --

16

QUESTION:

No, flexibly -- what in my deep

17

magenta case -- you know, the Daubert factors are whether

18

the technique or theory used could be tested or refuted,

19

whether it's been a subject of peer review, the rate of

20

error.

21

I mean, think of my artist, my artist expert.

He says, I've seen 50 million paintings.

no bearing there, do they?

1

it may be appropriate not to apply -QUESTION:

2

All right.

Then if that's so, why

3

did you answer Justice O'Connor the way you did?

4

wouldn't it be whether the shoe fits, i.e., whether the

5

Daubert factor applies here or not, is a matter for the

6

district judge, subject to review for abuse of discretion?

7

MR. BABINGTON:

Why

Well, the district -- our point

8

is that the district judge should be allowed to ask the

9

logical, common sense questions.
QUESTION:

10

I'm asking my question.

My question

11

is, why did you reply to Justice O'Connor by saying -- why

12

didn't you say -- I want you to have a chance -- whether

13

you apply the Daubert factors or whether you apply my deep

14

magenta, which is experience, depends on the circumstance.

15

The circumstance is up to the district judge, reviewable

16

for abuse of discretion in the court of appeals.

17

Now, you either agree with that, or you don't.

18

I want to know if you agree with it and, if you don't, why

19

not?

20

MR. BABINGTON:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BABINGTON:

We think that the broad --

Do you agree with what I said or not?
We think that the broad standard

23

should be that -- reviewable as for -- under - - as I

24

understood, Justice O'Connor's question was, what was the

25

standard of review, and the standard is a matter of law.

Now, how that standard is applied is for abuse

of discretion.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I still want to know if

you agree with the way I put it.
You don't have to agree by any means, but I'd

really like to know.

7

again, or not?

I - - do you want me to repeat it

MR. BABINGTON:

8

No.

I think I understand the

question, which is that in certain cases, would a district
10

court be wrong, or would he err in not applying the

11

Daubert factors.

Is that the --

QUESTION:

12

No.

My question is whether the shoe

13

fits, whether you apply Daubert factors to an expert or

14

something else, like deep magenta, experience, whether you

15

do one or the other depends on whether the shoe fits in

16

the particular case.

17

reviewable for abuse of discretion.

18

It's up to the district judge,

Whether our case is a case involving a general,

1

testable theory, or our case is a case involving reliance

20

upon the expert's personal experience, whether it's the

21

one or the other is up to -- you see what I'm saying?

22

I clear?

MR. BABINGTON:

I think, you know, we're arguing

24

over semantics.

question is, I think that the standard is a legal

Standard, reviewable de novo, but how that standard is

applied in a particular case is reviewable by abuse of

discretion.
QUESTION:

4

I thought your -- are you going back

on your brief?

I thought your brief's position was,

always okay to use the Daubert standards,

Exactly.

Our point is that the

district court should be allowed to ask these questions as

appropriate --

MR. BABINGTON:

20

It's never wrong --- in every case.

It's never wrong to ask those

questions.

MR. BABINGTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BABINGTON:

Right.

If --

Isn't that your position?
Yes.

If the proponent of the

evidence, Justice Scalia,

factor should not be given much weight in this case,

comes forward and says, this

then,

1

of course, the court can say, as this Court noted in

2

Daubert, that perhaps peer review isn't something that

3

would be applicable in every case, and it should be given

4

little or no weight, and the --

5

QUESTION:

Isn't it applicable in every case?

6

If you have two witnesses, and one of them comes up with a

7

magenta kind of stuff, and the other one comes up with

8

something that seems equivalently fuzzy but he says, and

9

by the way, my judgment as to these 1,000 paintings was

10

subjected to peer review, and the entire artistic

11

community agreed with me, wouldn't that make his testimony

12

more reliable?

13

MR. BABINGTON:

That's exactly our point.

It

14

should be based on the evidence that's before the court.

15

It may be that in a particular case the expert

That's our point.
How about the beehive keeper that the

22

Eleventh Circuit fastened on as an example of somebody who

22

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States submits that the court of

experience is categorically exempt from the reliability

ensure that expert testimony, whatever its subject matter,

3

rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task

4

at hand.

5

respect between expert testimony that rests on scientific

6

principles and expert testimony that rests on experience,

7

nor did it lay down iron-clad rules governing what

8

reliability factors a trial judge may properly consider.

This Court did not draw distinctions in that

Instead, the court recognized that the
10

reliability inquiry is a flexible one, and that a trial

11

judge should be able to call upon the full range of

12

relevant considerations in determining whether the expert

13

testimony is sufficiently reliable to assist the trier of

14

fact .

15

The Daubert decision did identify four general

16

factors that a court may find useful in assessing an

17

expert's methodology.

Mr. Minear, do you agree that as a

MR. MINEAR:

We think that is a relevant

2

consideration and, in fact, broadly speaking, that is

3

reflected in one of the Daubert factors, whether there's

4

general acceptance of the opinion that's expressed, but we

5

also believe that that's only one factor, and --

QUESTION:

What if there's no standard of -- I

mean, what if there's no standard of reliability in the

relevant discipline?

I mean, what if there is a whole

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

Do you have to say, well, since there

13

are no standards of reliability in this field, we have to

14

let any expert testify?

15

MR. MINEAR:

Certainly not.

We think the

16

ultimate responsibility for the trial judge is to make a

17

rational determination of whether the evidence is

18

sufficiently reliable to assist the trier of fact.

19

If there is no indicia of reliability

20

whatsoever, if the field is simply raft with odd theories

21

that cannot be reconciled and have never been tested, and

22

we think that's an important consideration for the trial

23

judge to take into account, and would most likely exclude

24

that type of evidence.

QUESTION:

2

Do you think that in this case the

3

district court's decision not to admit the testimony

4

should have been affirmed?
MR. MINEAR:

5

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

We believe

6

that the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in

7

determining that Mr. Carlson's methodology was not

8

sufficiently reliable.
QUESTION:

9

And you think that the court of

10

appeals should review it on an abuse of discretion

11

standard, that we don't have some issue of law here?
MR. MINEAR:

12

That is correct, although there is

13

an issue of law here, based on what the court of appeals

said.

QUESTION:

Yes. I agree with that, Justice -Indeed, that would have been a legal

5

error even with regard to the most scientific of

6

scientific testimony, wouldn't it?

7

MR. MINEAR:

I think that's right.

An example,

8

perhaps, to explain that would be a statistician who

9

offers a theory that -- Bayes' theory on statistics, and

10

he attempts to validate that theory simply by a logical

11

proof, and he goes step by step and proves that that

statistical theory is accurate.

for it to be admitted without testing, without peer

QUESTION:

1

And is that because there was nothing

2

to link the experience with the conclusion that he was

3

ready to offer?
MR. MINEAR:

4

That's correct.

If Mr. Carlson was

5

simply testifying on his own visual examination of the

6

standards of abuse on the tire, we don't think that that

7

would necessarily be an abuse of discretion.
The problem with Mr. Carlson's testimony here

8

9

was there was nothing to support his ultimate conclusion

10

that there must be a defect.

11

which the trial court -- this is what concerned the trial

12

court.

13

that because there are only marginal signs of abuse, there

14

must be a defect, and that's where his focus was.

15

His -- there was no way in

There was no way it could validate his opinion

It would be as if in Justice Breyer's

canvas that had been sprayed with dye.

19

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.

In other words,

20

you're drawing is an analytical leap, to use the language

21

that was set forth in Joiner, that simply was not

22

justified on a rational basis alone, and that's why the

23

court here thought it necessary to make a further inquiry.

24
25

Now, all four of the inquiries it made were
highly pertinent to that question. If Mr. Carlson's

testimony was,

in fact, accurate,

if his methodology was

2

accurate, then it should be susceptible to testing.
What was really concerning the trial court here

was that there was no testing that was done here,

5

there was no way to know whether any of Mr. Carlson's

6

projections or predictions with respect to defects had

ever been proved.

9

Now --

QUESTION:

8

May I ask, if there had been -- the

here, what we could have had here would simply be a

them based on his experience and the like, so I don't

think that he testified that there was no evidence of

abuse.

4

there is shoulder wear on the tire, but I ascribe that to

causes other than abuse.

I think actually his testimony was that oh, yes,

But the real problem here was that leap that,

6

7

well, simply because I only see these signs of abuse, the

tire must be defective.

9

The problem with the process of elimination

10

approach is, you must make sure that you've eliminated all

of the possible causes, and certainly there are many

tabloids that reported flying saucers based on a flawed

process of elimination technology.

14

on a flawed process of elimination basis to trick the

viewer.

Many magic tricks turn

rightly skeptical of the application of a process of

elimination theory without any sort of supporting

corroboration that would indicate that that process was,

in fact, valid, and that again was what I think really

Why would Alabama law control whether

3

Rule 702?

4

MR. JACKSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JACKSON:

It would not, Mr. Chief Justice.

Then why are you saying what you are?
Because the petitioners take the

7

point, or take the standpoint in their briefs and down

8

below that this type of expert testimony cannot lead

9

anywhere in the context of the facts of this case, and

10

certainly his testimony, his proffer can, because we know

11

that if abuse is ruled out as the cause of the

12

Carmichaels' tire failure, then whether or not the tire

13

failed due to a defect is properly an issue for the jury.

14

It's a question of fact.

15

And here, Mr. Carlson was going to take the

16

tire, he was going to take it in front of the jury, he was

17

going to explain that, based on his years of experience at

18

Michelin in watching thousands of tires fail and examining

19

the carcass of those tires, that there would be four

20

signs, objective indicia of abuse, and he would show where

21

those signs should be, and he would point to the sidewall

deterioration and show --

should be admitted to begin with, and what factors the

court should or should not look at in determining that

threshold of reliability in order to allow him to testify,

MR. JACKSON:

Well, his basis would be, based on

his experience, that if you do not see those signs of

between scientific and nonscientific.

You know the old

That was an easy way to do it, because this

expert's testimony was so far removed from a teratologist

that the criteria in Daubert just had no place at all, but

MR. JACKSON:

I do not disagree with the

15

the sentencing guideline case where the judge deviated

from the sentencing guidelines, that this was an absolute

error of law to incorrectly interpret Daubert and

Then there's a scale from highly

doesn't conform to reality.
MR. JACKSON:

Well,

I believe in the Eleventh

Circuit, using the beekeeper analogy, they kind of drew a

10

spectrum, beekeepers on one end, teratologists on the

11

other, and said, this tire failure analysis, who gets his

12

hands dirty showing the jury what's there and what's not

there is more like a beekeeper who has a lot of

experience.
QUESTION:

15

But he had a test.

He said, here's

my method, I've got these four factors.

Going back to

17

Justice Breyer's question, isn't it at least appropriate

18

to ask, do the other experts agree with this four-factor

test, and if you don't find two, whatever his method was.
And on that point, is there anything that

attests to the reliability of his method, that four-factor

That's an error of law based on a

11

going to use abuse of discretion.
Certainly just because the court of appeals

that's not an error of law.

MR. JACKSON:

you're in the Eleventh Circuit applying abuse of

I guess the -- in my mind, anyway,

I think the

16

hardest question for you would be, you'd say, well,

17

there is a theory going on here that in the absence of

You mean nails couldn't be an abuse?

You mean,

You're going on some

question would be?

MR. JACKSON:

My response to that question would

13

be, the two nail holes, it's being run a long time, it's

14

not the best tire on earth, that goes to the weight and

15

not the admissibility of this testimony, and this

16

testimony is certainly reliable, because this expert did

17

consider the nail holes, he did consider the bald spot,

18

and he had an answer for that.

19

It may not be an answer that the jury believes,

20

but it's based on reliable experience with the leader in

21

the tire industry, namely, Michelin.

22

type of work for 10 years while he was at Michelin, and

23

that goes to the soul of 702, knowledge.

factors go to the inquiry of the relevancy.

It can be based on

And then does his testimony fit?

Well,

5

certainly it fits, because he saw this same thing happen,

6

so he says, at Michelin, and again, if that's not good

7

enough for the jury, that's fine, but 702 is to enable the

jury to hear all of this testimony and then the judge

should determine, have we sustained our burden, producing

They're just not equipped.

MR. JACKSON:

That is a wonderful crossÂ­

2

examination, but this expert considered those factors, and

3

I think any expert would, and an expert can be ruled out

4

of court if he fails to rule out a crucial test.

5

On the same page where the judge said he didn't

6

like our analytical leap from the evidence to the

7

conclusion, he cited the Diviero case.

8

expert was kicked out of court because he did not do

9

exactly what Mr. Carlson did here.

10

In Diviero a tire

He did not rule out abuse, tire cracking,

11

sidewall deterioration, and they said -- and that was

12

based on testimony from the tire industry that unless you

13

rule out abuse, you cannot prove defect.

14

So in essence what Mr. Carlson did here is

15

something that's been approved by the industry.

16

no doubt that the judge should make there be a threshold

17

status of reliability before an expert testifies, but the

18

burden is not as high as petitioners want it.

19

There's

If the burden is, you've got to fit within the

20

Daubert factors, then all of this experience-based

testimony, which is by and large used by law enforcement,

is in danger.

11

We urge the Court to go further and affirm the

district court's holding, because the district court got

it right here.

14

It did not abuse its discretion.

The district court considered the respondent's

15

primary argument before this Court on page 93 in the joint

16

appendix in its opinion on reconsideration, and it said

17

there that the plaintiffs contend that Mr. Carlson's

testimony reveals that the methodology and principles

19

adopted by Carlson are widely accepted in the relevant

community.

The court declines to make such a leap.
So the district court has already considered the

respondent's primary argument and rejected it,
