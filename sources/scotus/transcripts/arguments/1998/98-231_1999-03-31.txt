ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MESCON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. MESCON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court is being asked today to ratify a

11
12

significant expansion in the powers of the Federal

13

district courts to issue preliminary injunctions.

14

should not do for two reasons.

15

This it

First, there is no historical or statutory

16

predicate for the issuance of a preliminary injunction to

17

restrain the disposition of the assets of a defendant

18

which assets are unrelated to the underlying cause of

19

action and are located outside the jurisdiction of the

20

court.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Mescon, do you mind giving us a

22

little preliminary information here?

I'm concerned

23

basically with a potential mootness problem.

24

your petition rests, I take it, on -- on an -- an

25

allegation that your client is entitled to damages by

Your suit,

virtue of an improper preliminary injunction.

MR. MESCON:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MESCON:

5

QUESTION:

6

And there's a bond outstanding -That is correct.
-- which could be -- the damages

could be secured from the bond.
But as I understand it, the preliminary

7
8

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

injunction has become a final injunction.
MR. MESCON:

9

That is correct, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MESCON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MESCON:

14

QUESTION:

15

why we should be deciding it.
MR. MESCON:

16

Is that right?

And no appeal was taken from that.
The -Is that right?
That is correct, Justice O'Connor.
Okay.

So, tell me what's left and

The issues that would -- that Your

17

Honor has suggested would render this appeal moot arise in

18

cases where the issue to be decided on the merits is the

19

same as the issue to be decided in the preliminary

20

injunction.
For example, in Camenisch, which is the case

21
22

relied on primarily by the respondents, the claim was that

23

the student was entitled to an interpreter under section

24

504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

25

granted.

The injunction was

The case came to this Court before the case had

1

been decided on the merits.
But let's assume that the case had come to this

2

3

Court after the case had been decided on the merits.

4

Clearly if the -- if the injunction had been vacated, the

5

State would have had a remedy, namely, the remedy of

6

recouping the amount of money it had paid for the

7

interpreter.
That is not so here because there is no claim in

8

this case that the permanent injunction was improper.
10

There is no claim in this case that the plaintiffs did not

11

have a probability of success on the merits.

12

this case is as to the power of the court to issue the

13

preliminary injunction.

14
15

QUESTION:

The claim in

And on that, you rest on New York law

basically.
MR. MESCON:

16

Right, that under -- no.

The --

17

the power of the court -- the absence of the power of the

18

court to issue a preliminary injunction is true both under

1

traditional principles of equity and also under New York

20

law.

21

QUESTION:

What are your damages from -- what -

22

- what would you receive if you showed that the

23

preliminary injunction was wrong even though the -- the

24

final injunction is okay?

25

MR. MESCON:

Justice Scalia,

if I could prevail

on proving that and establishing damages, my damages would

2

be the loss to GMD for the inability to restructure its

3

debt, conduct its business, and organize its affairs

4

during the 4 months of the pendency of the preliminary

5

injunction, which damages --

QUESTION:

Well, but it shouldn't have been

doing that anyway.

8

9

wrongful to do that?

10

12

13
14

I mean, doesn't the preliminary

MR. MESCON:

No.

If absent the preliminary

injunction -QUESTION:

Not the preliminary.

The final

inj unction.
MR. MESCON:

No.

The final injunction says that

15

when one has a judgment, one can restrain the assets of

16

the debtor.

17

there is a final judgment, before there is a permanent

18

injunction, there is no power in the court to restrain the

19

assets of the debtor unrelated to the underlying --

20

The very point in this case is that before

QUESTION:

You're talking about a period then

21

just between the issuance of the preliminary injunction

22

and the final injunction.

23

MR. MESCON:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
And you say that that caused

discrete, demonstrable damages to your client.

MR. MESCON:

1

2

We would --we have not yet proved

that.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MESCON:

5

QUESTION:

That's the theory of your case.
Yes, Justice Kennedy.
The theory behind that is that it may

6

entirely be proper now to enjoin a certain use of those

7

assets, but it would not have been wrong to use those

8

assets for the other purposes, for want of which you have

9

sustained damages.

10

MR. MESCON:

That is correct.

At any moment

11

until April 17th, 197 -- 1998, when Judge Martin issued

12

that permanent injunction, GMD was free to do with its

13

assets whatever it wished to do.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Mescon, I thought Judge Martin

15

said, look, I basically want to make sure that if there

16

is, as I think there will be, a judgment for the

17

plaintiff, there's something to realize it against, but I

18

don't want to be rigid about this.

19

could come back?

20

a showing of some need in order to keep the company going.

21

Didn't he say that you

He said, Grupo may seek modification on

Given -- given that opportunity that he gave

22

you, he didn't say you're immobile.

23

a good reason to relax the injunction, come tell me and

24

we'll talk about it.

25

MR. MESCON:

He said, if you have

Justice Ginsburg, you're correct.

He did give us an opportunity to come and make an

2

application for leave to make expenses, if you will, in

3

the ordinary course of business.

4

which was clearly in significant financial straights,

5

where it remains today, wanted to do is effect a

6

restructuring of its debts, not merely to pay its current

7

obligations as they were due, wanted to make, if you will,

8

preferential payments perhaps, preferential under our

9

bankruptcy code.
QUESTION:

For parties other than this

plaintiff.

MR. MESCON:

QUESTION:

But what the company,

Pardon me?
For parties other than this

plaintiff.

15

MR. MESCON:

16

QUESTION:

Parties other than this plaintiff.
So, the -- what you -- you are

17

arguing essentially, if I understand you, that you wanted

18

to be able to deal with your other creditors so that there

19

would not be -- the consequence of that would -- there

20

would not be these assets against which the final decision

21

could be realized.

22

MR. MESCON:

I would only quibble with one part

23

of your comment, Justice Ginsburg.

We wanted to deal with

24

these -- these assets not so there would be nothing

25

available, but rather with the effect that there would be

nothing available.

2

assets available for these plaintiffs, but that would have

3

been the effect of the action.

4

agree with Your Honor's observation.
QUESTION:

6

With that qualification, I

So -- but the judges -- we're talking

about a 3 and a half month period?

7
8

The purpose was not to eliminate

MR. MESCON:

It's a week less than 4 months,

Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

And you said something about the

10

court hasn't power to do this preliminarily, and one of

11

the reasons was, you said, in New York they wouldn't do

12

it.

13

Suppose New York law were otherwise.

14

New York law says, if you make out a very strong case on

15

the merits and also a very strong case that unless there's

16

an injunction during the pendency of the suit, the assets

17

will be gone.

18

Suppose that were the New York law.

We will give you that freeze worldwide.

Right.

But now we're in the Erie days.
But nowadays, after Erie against

Tompkins, my answer to your question would be if a New

7

York statute afforded this right to the plaintiffs in a

8

diversity action in New York, they would have this right.
QUESTION:

9

But you say we don't have to decide

that as -- as things are in this case.

11

MR. MESCON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MESCON:

That is correct.

First of all --

You're fortunately spared the -Yes.

We have the --we have the

14

benefit of -- of Judge McLaughlin's insights into what New

15

York law provides.

17

law does not permit such an injunction.

18

We have an explicit finding by the

QUESTION:

Well, does -- does it work the other

19

way around?

20

this mean that under Erie the Federal court may not do it?

Does the absence of a State mechanism to do

MR. MESCON:

21

Yes.

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

I

22

would say that this case and a diversity case is governed

23

by Erie, and for that reason, we must look to New York

24

State law.

25

injunction cannot be issued in the New York State courts,

New York State law provides that such an

and the old across-the-street argument applies.

shouldn't be able to do it --

QUESTION:

We

Even if the rules explicitly gave the

court authority?

5

MR. MESCON:

QUESTION:

7

MR. MESCON:

Not so.

If the rule --

You should make that clear.
If under Hanna -- if we -- if rule

8

65 were amended so as to give the Federal courts this

9

authority, then in my view this would be within the Rules

10

Enabling Act.

11

congressional or court rulemaking authority, and therefore

12

that would also, if you will, trump State law as -- as in

13

Hanna, the service requirement --

14
15

It would be a proper exercise of

QUESTION:

You're saying neither -- neither rule

64 nor 65 authorize what was done here.

16

MR. MESCON:

That is correct.

Rule 65 does not

17

authorize what was done here because rule 65 is -- is a -

18

- is a mechanism, is a cookbook, is a recipe of how to get

19

one.

20

bases for a preliminary injunction.

Snowboard in the Ninth Circuit and the decision by Justice

22

--by Judge Clark in Frankie v. Wilchek in the Second

procedural or substantive under Erie is that it is

What do you do -- suppose A sues B in

different route in New York of accomplishing the exactly

Yes, Justice Breyer, but a route

that is not sanctioned by the traditional equity

MR. MESCON:

All legal.

I don't think that the New York

courts would issue such an injunction.
QUESTION:

No, no, but what they do is get to

the same result in a different way.
MR. MESCON:

Yes, by going to New Jersey and

getting an attachment.
QUESTION:

All right.

So, in fact, why can't

11

the Federal court, although it doesn't have exactly the

12

same legal mechanisms because they're not involved in

13

exactly the same thing, get to precisely the same result,

14

which is in fact to attach property abroad to satisfy a

15

likely judgment in a legal action?

MR. MESCON:
certainly --

QUESTION:

19

MR. MESCON:

20
21

Well, with regard to attachment

Don't call it attachment.
-- because rule 64 says that you

look to State for attachment.
For rule 65, you don't do it because the court

22

can't do it.

It doesn't have the -- the courts don't have

But, of course, they do in fact have

that very power if the underlying action is equitable.

3

MR. MESCON:

Of course.

QUESTION:

And do they --

QUESTION:

Mr. Mescon, I suppose that hanging a

guilty person without a trial achieves the same result in

MR. MESCON:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

I wasn't talking about that.

QUESTION:

It's not permissible, is it?

MR. MESCON:

But -- but certainly in an

equitable action, they do have that power.

MR. MESCON:

Right, and what happens -And that's what the -- the

MR. MESCON:

If this were an action for a

There are cases -- a good example really is --

2

3

even in First National City Bank, the question is how

4

attenuated, how close is the relationship between

5

plaintiff's claim and the object in question.

6

conceive of a case where that relationship was

7

significantly close, that the plaintiff's interest in the

thing to be enjoined would justify the issuance of an

injunction.

I could

I can think of many cases, routine money

10

damages cases, like actions on a note, for example, as was

11

here, where that connection would not be so close.

12

so, I --

13

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Mescon, I -- I thought that the

14

reason for New York's -- I mean, New York lets you put

15

your hands on anything that's in New York -- that what was

16

behind New York's limitation is the notion that New York

17

lacks the power until there's a final judgment to put a

18

freeze on assets outside.

19

question of New York's policy of protecting this debtor

20

from having its assets touched, but New York's notion of

21

its own powerlessness that's at work, why should that be

22

applicable in the Federal court which doesn't have that

23

powerlessness?

there's a great difference from an injunction before we

have adjudicated that there is a debtor and an injunction

after there has been adjudication that the debt is owed.

9

MR. MESCON:

Yes.

Under New York law 5222 of

10

the CPLR, which rule 69 makes applicable in the Federal

11

courts, there is an absolute right in the court to enjoin

12

a debtor from parting with any asset of any kind after

13

there's a judgment until the judgment is satisfied.

14

we -- while initial notice of appeal from the final

15

judgment did contest that, because the notice of appeal

16

was filed within a couple of days of the final judgment,

17

when we drafted our brief on the merits for that second

18

appeal from the final judgment, we withdrew that claim

11

and with respect to the Erie issue as well.

12

First of all, on the question of the

13

applicability of Camenisch, we believe that Camenisch

14

makes very clear that the issue of the ability to sue for

damages on the bond is not a matter that can be resolved

What GMD argues here is that there is no nexus.

There's no nexus between the preliminary injunction and

lower court judges, that is, the trial judge and the court

of appeals.

It was not fairly

I think the colloquy

Now, they have pointed to a decision by the

18

Second Circuit in this case in which the court says all

parties agree that this type of relief would not be

20

available under rule 64 or New York injunction law.
First of all,

that entire discussion in the

And secondly -- and I know it's somewhat curious

3

that the court says rule 64 and the injunction statute,

4

but what it was saying was that under New York law,

also get an injunction in aid of that attachment process.

So,

if one

I think that it is unfair to look at that

decision as a pronouncement on what New York law would,

fact, hold if those courts had been invited to consider

10

Erie and go through the process that you were discussing

11

with Mr. Mescon.

12

Let me turn to the basic issue here, though.

in

I

13

think Mr. Mescon has been very direct and very candid in

14

saying that there's no historical or statutory predicate

15

for what the district judge did here, and indeed, that

16

this court has no power to authorize a Federal judge to do

17

what Judge Martin did here.

18

I am reminded of a quotation from Justice Holmes

19

in which he said that it is revolting to have no better

20

reason for a rule of law than that's what was laid down in

21

the time of Henry IV.

22

grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long

23

since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation

24

of the past.

revolting part of that statement by Mr. Justice Holmes,

Now,

It is still more revolting if the

but I think it does get to the heart of this.
What basically GMD is saying is that there were

2

3

cases in the 19th century where parties sought to get

4

freeze orders and were told that they were unable to do

5

that, that the court simply could not provide that type of

6

relief.

7

other cases that go to the same point.

them in terms of their being pre-merger, when courts were

is, a freeze order that would take the defendants property

QUESTION:

Mr. Days, do you think that the

16

merger of law and equity enlarged the -- the kind of

17

remedies that were available?

18

MR. DAYS:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what the

19

merger did was allow a court, sitting on both law and

20

equity cases, to use remedies that previously would have

21

been available only in a court of equity after there had

22

been some satisfaction of a judgment in -- on the law side

Well, I think -- I think that

7

certainly if the law had been clear in that respect, the

courts had been very clear that no matter what the

circumstances, no matter what the merger, no matter what

10

happened to the Seventh Amendment rights that were always

11

implicated in that type of situation, then we'd have a

different -- different problem.

in the past, that if indeed we want to give creditors more

I mean, that's -- that's

Justice Scalia, I think that what

QUESTION:

But you don't have a single case

MR. DAYS:

Well, I think that the fact that

there haven't been many of these cases arising is

17

reflective of the fact that in most instances we don't

have the unique circumstances presented in this case.

19

have a situation where there is a party that admitted that

3

And one can go down

Under those circumstances, what we believe is

4

the case, that if one looks at the nature of equity, the

5

flexibility and the adapting to new circumstances that has

6

always characterized the equity power of Federal courts,

7

that it is not inappropriate for the equity court in 1

8

to try to deal with this situation.
QUESTION:

10

Are you saying that we're doing this

to supplement the void in the bankruptcy laws?
MR. DAYS:

11

No.

I'm simply saying that it goes

12

to the whole question of whether, for example, there's an

13

adequate remedy at law, whether there's irreparable harm.

Well, I would have thought that would

Well, I -- I won't -- I don't want to

go to the point of seeing this as merely a gap-filling

procedure.

It is a procedure in which a Federal court is

11

presented with a party and it is told, as Mr. Mescon has

told this Court, you are completely powerless, no matter

about irreparable harm, the inadequacy of legal remedies,

of years that, as long as Federal courts are applying

There's something called a Babanaft proviso which makes

about your taking Erie out of the picture because you say

indicated, it is really the embodiment of the principles

5

about rule 64.

It says nothing about what would happen

under rule 65.

And, indeed, we've mentioned the Zonghetti

what level one wants to look at in interpreting New York

I would say yes, Your Honor, because

as this Court has indicated, it tries to get -- and
Justice Ginsburg's questions I think got to this point.

10

What is the State interest?

Well, we don't know what the

11

State interest here assuming that the -- the defendants

12

are right, GMD is right, about New York law.
But I think that we've set out in our brief an

13
14

indication that there are several layers of New York law,

15

and for example, where there's a showing of irreparable

16

harm or possibility of insolvency, New York's courts do

17

allow for this type of injunctive relief.

conflict with what GMD asserts is the New York rule, and

I cannot point to some sentence, but

Federal equity, that when a party is experiencing

directly on point, we think that this Court's decisions in

10

Byrd v. Blue Ridge Electric and, indeed, the discussion in

11

Gasperini points to the fact that there are essential

12

characteristics of Federal courts that need to be

13

protected even where the Erie analysis comes into play.

14

And we think what we have here is not merely a response of

15

a judge to the claim of a plaintiff who has no other

16

alternatives, it is a response to the fact that what GMD

17

basically said to the court was, you can do nothing.

18

Catch me if you can, but you have no power to do that.

19

So, what we're talking about is a Federal court's ability

20

to be able to issue an effectual judgment.

21

Now, this is a case where there was no defense

22

reason to challenge what was going on.

25

dismissal of the counterclaims.

First,

in this case there was no allegation of a

fraudulent conveyance.

I start by saying that.

All of

the transfers were made in consideration of valid debts,
