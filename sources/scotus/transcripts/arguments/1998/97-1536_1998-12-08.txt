ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR.

IRVINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court should adopt a categorical bright

12

line rule that nontribal members who work as Federal

13

contractors on Indian reservations are subject to

14

nondiscriminatory State taxes unless Congress expressly

15

provides otherwise.

16

recognize a uniform rule that applies throughout the

17

country, and provide certainty and predictability to

18

contractors, the Federal Government, and to States.

19

This rule is consistent with this Court's

This rule will clarify existing law,

20

precedents regarding Federal contractors and will not

21

require the Court to rule -- overrule any of its decisions

22

concerning taxation of persons doing business with Indian

23

tribes or tribal members.

This is the rule that the United States itself
argues here should apply.

QUESTION:

1

Let me ask you a question.

There's

2

something, legislation, called the Self-Determination Act

3

under which, if I understand it correctly, an Indian tribe

4

could opt to accept Federal money to build roads and

5

projects like this using that money but itself

6

administering the program.

7

Now, if the tribe had done so and had awarded

8

the contract in question here, could -- could the State

9

have been able to impose the tax then, do you think?
MR. IRVINE:

10

No, Your Honor.

Under the

11

authority of the Ramah Navajo School Board case, if a

12

contractor -- a nontribal member contractor deals directly

13

with a tribal entity, then there is no State tax.

22

15

MR. IRVINE:

I guess,

We don't argue that there are any

16

direct services directly to these contracts or the

17

particular geographic location.

18

the State has not ignored these reservations and does

1

provide numerous general services to the reservations and,

20

indeed, to Blaze both on and off the reservation.

21

not argued that there have to be direct services.

State may have very little authority to regulate the

But Congress --

4

QUESTION:

Well, but I thought that we had made

5

a special inquiry into the extent the State has provided

6

services when Indian sovereignty is at stake, as opposed

7

to whether or not the State can just tax a Federal

8

contractor without added complication of an Indian

9

reservation.

10

MR.

11

QUESTION:

12

13

IRVINE:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.
In other words, the Cotton Petroleum

case requires us to make this sort of inquiry.
MR.

IRVINE:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

14

this issue of Federal contractors has never been addressed

15

by the Court.

16

a party to the contract really changes the nature of the

17

analysis because the Federal sovereign is such an

18

overwhelming presence.

19

need the courts to protect it from States.

21

were not -- not supported by the law.

1

Petroleum inquiry then is -- is not necessary when there's

2

a Federal contractor involved?

3

MR.

IRVINE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

And if it -- if a contract still involved a

5

contract with someone other than the Federal Government,

6

the Court's analysis, the balancing test, the

7

particularized inquiry would still be effective,

8

we argue in our brief, the lower court misapplied that

9

analysis as well just because it didn't take into account

though as

10

that tribal sovereignty, tribal interests are not really

11

affected in any significant way when it's a contract

12

between a nontribal member and a nonmember such as the

3
4

United States itself.
QUESTION:

What about the argument that it will

5

reduce the total amount available for road building if

6

some money has to be spent in paying State taxes, that

7

that money that could be spared would otherwise be

8

available to build more roads inside the reservation?

9

MR.

IRVINE:

Your Honor,

I think the -- this

20

Court has consistently held, both in the context of

21

Federal contractors and even contracts on reservations,

22

that the very fact that there may be economic effects are

23

not sufficient to preempt the tax.

24

a Federal contractor, that's even more applicable.

7

In U.S. v.

I believe it was a cost-plus contract,

so

Economic effects themselves are not

As the United States points out in its brief,

8

merely because there's a tax on the Federal contractor

9

does not necessarily mean that there will be an impact on

10

the -- the number -- the amount of roads built or the

11

amount of work done because it will hinge on what the

2

agency does, what Congress does in their appropriations.

3

There's no evidence that Congress hasn't appropriated

4

funds taking into account the full amount of the taxes and

5

equally could reduce the appropriation if there's a less

6

-- 5 percent less because of the tax.

7

So,

the economic effects are a difficult

standard to apply and this Court has generally rejected it

11

contractors and the Federal Government benefit by having

12

certainty and predictability knowing when the contract is

13

issued whether it's subject to tax, which is why we focus

14

on who the contracting parties are as opposed to a more

15

amorphous standard, which may very well apply in the

16

context when tribal interests are affected but where the

17

Federal sovereign is a party to the contract and can

certainly protect itself from overreaching State taxes.

Those considerations just aren't an issue.

And so, there really

The tribe's involvement in the making and performance of

situation, Your Honor, these concerns about direct

2

relations with the tribe, tribal sovereignty, and economic

3

self-sufficiency of the tribe would be at issue because

4

the tribe would be a party to the contract.

5

With regard to the third major reason we think

6

that the State taxes on Federal contracts don't call for

7

the application of that doctrine, though, is because the

8

core concerns about the regulation of direct relations

9

with Indians is not present because the tribe is not a --

10

a member to the contract.

Those kinds of Federal

11

concerns are found in the Indian Commerce Clause, the

12

Federal Government's ability to regulate commerce directly

13

with Indian tribes, and in statutes such as the Indian

14

trader statutes and the Self-Determination Act statute,

15

which Justice O'Connor asked about.

16

underlying those statutes would come into play if the

17

Indian tribe were a direct party to the contract.

The interests

Also, regarding the economic self-sufficiency,

19

as United States v. New Mexico makes clear, in a case

would not have that authority if they were the direct

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1980, the State of Arizona came to this Court

10

and admitted that it wanted to tax a nonmember use of BIA

11

roads, and this Court in White Mountain v. Bracker told

12

the State of Arizona, you cannot tax when a nonmember uses

13

those same BIA roads.

14

Now the State is here to say when a nonmember is

15

building those same BIA roads, we are entitled to tax it.

16

Under the implied preemption analysis for Indian cases,

17

this Court should affirm the decision of the Arizona Court

18

of Appeals and hold that this tax is preempted.

19

The central issue in this case is,

I believe,

20

what test should this Court apply.

21

United States v. New Mexico rule, or should it apply

22

Indian preemption analysis?

23

Should it apply the

There are several reasons why United States v.

And now, the Government's position here is,

well, this is not going to interfere in tribal

what it's going to do is it's going to send a message

broad policy statements, but it is going to interfere with

the way Mr. Ward will do his job tomorrow and the way in

9

which the Navajos, the Gila River reservations, and the

I believe that it will interfere in tribal

other tribes interact with Mr. Ward.

Mr. Ward will now

11

have to go to these tribes and say, if you want a hundred

percent of your Federal dollars under these contracts, you

13

should do the contracts yourself, but if you can get by

14

with 95 percent of the budget for your contracts, then we

can do that.

16

-- and under the contracts that were at issue in this

case, that was his regulatory obligation, to tell the

tribes the financial impacts of these tribal self-

MR. SMITH:

2

I don't believe that it comes closer

to the New Mexico case, Justice O'Connor, for this reason.

Congress has given to tribes the right to make these what

Now,

if we have a situation where Congress is

responding to Indian tribes about interference with tribal

clarified its intent, has mandated that the BIA promulgate

aware of any such case.
But what I am aware of is prior decisions of

3

this Court like in the Colville case where it addressed a

4

-- an argument of tribal self-determination and the Court

5

applied the same preemption balancing test to determine

6

whether the State tax was preempted by Federal law.

7

in the Colville case, the Court applied that balancing

test and upheld the State tax because what was at issue

there was they --as the Court characterized it,

they're

QUESTION:

Now,

That's not --

Well, why -- why couldn't one take
