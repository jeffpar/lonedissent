CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

District v. Garrett F.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN L. SEITZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SEITZ:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Federal statute, the Individuals With

11
12

Disabilities Education Act, specifically provides that

13

school districts are not required to provide medical

14

services to students except for evaluation and diagnostic

15

purposes.

16

is whether nursing services which must be continuous and

17

exclusive for one student constitutes medical services.

18

Therefore, the fundamental issue in this case

When we go to a physician's office and we see a

19

nurse, and the nurse gives us an injection, we certainly

20

think we're getting a medical service.

21

go to a dialysis clinic and a technician administers

22

dialysis we think we're getting medical services.

23

■QUESTION:

Similarly, if we

Ms. Seitz, I follow what you're

24

saying, but we do have the Tatro case, and I would have

25

said in one sense the CIC is a medical service, so it

seems to me, at least from your brief, that you're not

2

resting on the character of the care that's rendered -- is

3

it a catheter, or what it is -- but the volume of it and

4

the cost, so it's -- the nature of the service seems to be

5

not part of your calculus.
In other words, if you took this string of care­

6

7

giving and you broke it down and you just had one, would

8

you say, oh, that's not -- that's a medical service, it's

9

not diagnostic?
MS. SEITZ:

10

Justice Ginsburg, catheterization,

11

even clean intermittent catheterization, is also commonly

12

thought of as a medical service.

13

a balance between those things that are the broad medical

14

service and those things which are school nursing services

15

which are required under the regulations as a related

16

service, so somehow we have to find a test that will be,

17

what is a school health service provided by a school nurse

18

versus those things that are just generally thought of as

19

medical?

20

However, we have to find

Certainly, CIC, as this Court found, was a

21

service that could be provided by a school nurse in a

short period of time.

1

the medical service exception, or they do cumulatively but

2

not individually?

3

MS. SEITZ:

Justice Ginsburg, we're saying they

4

do cumulatively, because obviously the Cedar Rapids

5

Community School District does provide clean intermittent

6

catheterization to other students.

7

tracheostomies for other students.

They also section

8

But the difference is, those are services that

9

can be done by a school nurse, or someone trained by the

10

school nurse, versus having to hire a person full-time to

11

attend to that child all day.

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, so you stipulate that the

tracheotomy procedure is -- can be a nursing service?

14

MS. SEITZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- if it was

15

just -- in fact, we have other students in the Cedar

16

Rapids District who have suction of tracheostomy tubes.

17

That by itself could be done by a school nurse, and that

18

school nurse could continue to perform his or her other

19

functions.

20

The difference with Garrett is that he needs

21

continuous monitoring and assessment to make sure that

22

he's not in respiratory distress, and at that point then

23

the school nurse cannot perform those functions.

24

are only six nurses in Cedar Rapids.

It's not because the nurse lacks the

a number of other responsibilities as school nurse.

MS. SEITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, that would be

MS. SEITZ:

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it also -I'm sorry.
It just depends on how many school

nurses you have.

MS. SEITZ:

11

I mean, if you have enough school

Actually, Your Honor, you would

have - QUESTION:

12

It's sort of hard to think that, you

13

know, that that makes a difference in the nature of the

14

service.

MS. SEITZ:

Your Honor, I don't believe it makes

16

a difference in the nature of the service.

17

medical or it's not medical, but we need to find a way to

18

give credence to the agency definition of school health

19

services, which we are not contesting that school health

20

services are related services.

21

QUESTION:

It's either

However --

Well, but you -- it seems to me you,

22

even on that assumption you've got a problem, because the

23

testimony in the case was, as I understand it, that you

24

don't even need a nurse to do this.

25

that the ALJ found that any, you know, competent person

2

could be trained to do these things.
The reason, as I understand it, that a nurse

3

would be required in Iowa is because the Iowa nursing

4

regulations so provide, but it seems to me that's Iowa's

5

problem and it doesn't have anything to do with the way we

6

should draw the definitional line under the statute.

7

So that even on your assumption, that the

8

statute said in effect, or meant, that continuous service

9

by a nurse would be within the exclusion, that in fact is

10

not the case here except under the Iowa regulations, and

11

surely the Iowa regulations can't govern the meaning of

12

the Federal statute.

13

MS. SEITZ:

Your Honor, first, you're correct

14

that the Iowa Board of Nursing did rule his care needed to

15

be provided by a nurse.

16

be delegated, even to a lay person, are clearly medical

17

services that would typically be either performed or

18

supervised by the nurse.

19

QUESTION:

However, the services that could

Okay.

Then the criterion then is not

20

the continuous nature of the service or the, in effect the

21

ultimate cost, it is in a more strictly analytical sense

22

it's the kind of service itself.

back on what I thought was very candid and clear of you

2

earlier when you said, if we took each one of these, the

3

tracheotomy, each one separately, it would be a related

4

service that wasn't within the medical exception, but when

5

you cumulate them altogether, it's the all-day,

6

continuous, that makes it medical service, so it seems to

7

me you were not -- your line depends upon duration and

8

expense, and not the character of the individual

9

services --

MS. SEITZ:

11

QUESTION:

MS. SEITZ:

Your Honor --- in the package.
I'm sorry.

Your Honor, we need to

determine the character first to determine whether it's

QUESTION:

17

22

But I thought you told me there was

not medical in the event of, say, the tracheotomy.

Then we need to apply other factors to see if it

No -- excuse me?

That it is

medical -QUESTION:

The tracheotomy is not medical, I

thought, because nurses routinely do this.
MS. SEITZ:

Excuse me.

It would still be a

23

medical service, but it would come under the school health

24

rather than the medical services exemption.

I'd also like to come back to Justice Souter's

comment about State licensure.

2

nonphysician bright line would come down to a State

3

licensure issue, because States obviously allow nurse

4

practitioners, they allow physician assistants to perform

5

services, so even under the physician-nonphysician there's

6

going to be some looking at State statutes.

7

QUESTION:

Even the physician-

Well, that's right, but because on

8

the assumption of the bright line test, what the bright

9

line is drawn between is what, I presume, in fact doctors

10

do and what, in fact, nurses do, but it seems to me that

11

that doesn't necessarily implicate the point that I was

12

trying to make earlier.

13

MS. SEITZ:

Your Honor, if, in fact, it were

14

physician-nonphysician bright line, it's difficult to

15

comprehend how there would be any meaning given to the

16

statutory exclusion.

17

What services would a physician --

18

QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand that.

I

19

mean, we would look to see who's doing the procedure, and

20

if in your State nurses are doing it, that would be the

21

end of the issue.

22

MS. SEITZ:

But what physician services would be

23

necessary during a school day, at school, to enable a

24

child to benefit from education.

provision meaningless.
Physicians see patients in clinics,

offices, in hospitals.
QUESTION:

4

Well,

it would mean that if there is

some procedure that can only be performed by a doctor, and

6

a doctor would have to come in once a day to do it, and it

7

was not diagnostic, et cetera,

8

I don't know how many such procedures there might be, but

then it would be excluded.

certainly the test would have meaning.
MS. SEITZ:

10

Your Honor, we cannot conceive of

11

any procedure that a physician would have to come in and

12

perform for a student during - QUESTION:

13

Then what gave Chief Justice Burger

14

the misimpression which he evidently had on your argument?

15

He said,

16

expensive and hospitals are expensive,

17

thought that without this exception some things that

18

doctors only do and some things that are done only in the

1

hospital could have been covered.

20

I understand this line because doctors are

MS. SEITZ:

so he must have

Justice Burger in the Tatro case

21

indicated that CIC could be done by a school nurse or a

22

lay person.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but when he talked about where

24

the line is drawn, he said, doctors cost a lot of money

25

and hospitals cost a lot of money.

Now, you are now telling us that doctors and

1

2

hospitals just don't fit into this picture, so was he

3

wrong in the impression that he had that they somehow

4

would have but for this medical services exception?
MS. SEITZ:

5

No.

We are in agreement with

6

Justice Burger that they carved out physician's services

7

because of cost, but we also believe that medical services

8

was never intended to mean only physicians.

9

one-on-one nursing all day -- this case indicates $20 to

10

$30,000 a year -- could be more costly than a physician.
QUESTION:

11

Certainly

But you're recognizing that he wasn't

12

dealing with an imaginary case when he thought that

13

doctors and hospitals could have been part of this

14

picture.

15
16

MS. SEITZ:

That doctors and hospitals could be

part of the included services, or - -

17

QUESTION:

18

mentioned them in his opinion.

19

things are very expensive, so I understand that Congress

20

wouldn't want them to be covered.

MS. SEITZ:

I believe Justice Burger said that

22

the agency definition of included services which made a

23

distinction between physicians and nonphysicians, and then

24

went on to say in Tatro that they have carved out

physician's services because it added additional expense

1

to districts.
But in fact if we use that analysis, the

2

3

additional expense to districts of intensive nursing

4

services would be greater than what an intermittent

5

physician's service could be.

6

We also have to remember that this Court decided

7

in the Rowley case in 1982 that the IDEA was in the nature

8

of a contract with the States and, as such, that any

9

conditions attached to the funding must be unambiguously

10
11

stated.
This is particularly true in education, which is

12

traditionally left to States and localities.

13

not specifically list in section 17 that nursing services

14

would be provided, and we would have to assume that there

15

is some indication in the act itself that felt -- they did

16

not think it should be provided.

17

Congress did

If you look at the literal language of the

18

statute it says that all corrective, developmental, and

19

supporting services needed to allow a child to benefit

20

from education is included, and then it has some medical

21

service exclusion.

22

But Congress went on and gave some specific

23

listings such as physical therapy, occupational therapy,

24

social work services, psychological services.

25

had intended for medical services to be a narrow

1

definition of physical physician's services they would not

2

have needed to list all those specific ones, because it

3

would have been covered under any supportive service.
However, a better interpretation would be that

4
5

they intended a broad definition of medical and then

6

listed those in order that they would be provided.
QUESTION:

7

Well, if you are saying that the act

8

imposes just a reasonable burden but not an extensive

9

burden on the States, we could argue on that.
As I understood the case, I was going to be

10
11

asked to determine whether or not this was a medical

12

service, and it seems to me that the two are different

13

questions.

14

MS. SEITZ:

Whether one-on-one nursing is a

15

medical service, Your Honor?

16

definition of medical services, whether you look to the

17

Internal Revenue Code, where you look to Worker Comp, have

18

always viewed private duty type nursing as a medical

19

service, and suddenly we're asking in this statute to give

20

it an uncommon meaning and say, no, medical means only

21

physicians.

22

QUESTION:

We believe that any -- any

Oh, I would assume nonprivate duty

23

nursing as well.

24

reasonableness of your position when you say that nursing

25

services are medical services, but you don't say that.

I mean, what I -- I can understand the

You say, we can do CIC, and the trouble is, we

1

2

can't do too much of it, and I don't know that the word

3

medical has anywhere in it the distinction between --a

4

distinction in volume.

5

medical.

If you do more of it, it becomes

If you do less of it, it's not medical.
It's either medical or not.

6

I mean, CIC is

7

either medical or not, so you -- it seems to me you have

8

to say nurses -- you know, nursing services, at least CIC,

9

is not covered.
MS. SEITZ:

10

Justice Scalia, actually I don't

11

think there's any question that CIC is a medical service

12

in common understanding.
QUESTION:

13

However, we - -

Well, but we had the Tatro decision,

14

and it said that was not a medical service.

15

dealt with that, so you have to come to grips with that, I

think.

services.
They are still medical services, as Justice

2

3

Scalia -QUESTION:

4

But that isn't what the Department

5

has said.

The Government doesn't support your position,

6

the Federal Government, and you're asking us to say that

7

continuous nursing services are medical services --

8

MS. SEITZ:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
But broken down and doing it

10

intermittently they're not, and that's a very hard line to

11

draw, as Justice Scalia has pointed out.

12

13
14

I don't think it's going to work.

Do you have a

fail-back position?
MS. SEITZ:

Your Honor, we believe that if we

15

allow a multi-factor test to be used, where you can

16

determine whether school nurses who traditionally serve

17

hundreds -- in fact, the ratio is 1 to 3,000 students --

18

can do the services, that it would be treated as a school

19

health service under the regulations.

20

I agree that it would be easier to say it's

21

either all medical or not medical, but this Court in Tatro

22

determined that the school health service regulation was a

23

reasonable regulation, so therefore we have to find where

24

is the limit drawn when it quits being a reasonable school

25

health service and becomes a medical service, and that's

why we have proposed the multi-factor test at looking

2

at
QUESTION:

3

You keep saying multi-factor test,

4

but it seems to me in all candor that your argument comes

5

down to, all day is too much, and we have brackets on this

6

target.

7

day, too much, and then there may be cases in between.

CIC, once a day, twice a day, not too much, all

8

But it seems to me what you're arguing is the

9

all day is the other extreme, and so it's duration, all

10

day is the most it could be, and expense, because it's all

11

the hours of the day.
So you keep talking about multi-factor tests,

12

13

but we have this case, and I'm trying to understand your

14

position.

15

but it's duration and expense.

16

MS. SEITZ:

It isn't based on the character of the care,

Yes, Your Honor.

That becomes the

17

determining factor.

Once you determine that the character

18

of the care is medical -- which I think as Justice Scalia

19

pointed out, even CIC, it's either medical or it isn't --

20

once you determine that it's medical, then you need to

21

make that multi-factor.

22

However, I agree that I cannot conceive of any

23

situation where it's continuous care that would not make

24

it fall under the medical services exception.

QUESTION:

On that, in your response to Justice

3

Scalia are you saying that we should overrule the Tatro

case, because that's what you seem to be saying if you say

that all of these are really medical service.

6

MS. SEITZ:

They are.

All of those services are

7

really medical services, but we don't believe you have to

8

overrule Tatro to get to the result in our case, because
there was already deference given in Tatro to the school

10

health regulation, and school districts can do the school

11

health regulation, but they need guidance on what they're

12

to do beyond those simple services that can be done on an

13

intermittent basis by existing personnel.

QUESTION:

You're saying we went as far as we

us any further.

In this case, the issue is whether additional

No, I'm asking some hypotheticals,

obviously.

MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

QUESTION:

I understand.

Because you told me that the facts of

this case are different, but I want to know how far your

argument takes us, and would it be different --

MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

The --

12

time and the ambulance had to be outside the school all

13

the time.
MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

Okay.

I think the question

really gets to the heart of what is a related service and

what limitations did the Court adopt --

I'm asking you -Okay.

if any.
MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

The limitations in Tatro were

22

expressed to be, the child is handicapped so as to require

23

special education.

24

services necessary to aid the handicapped child to benefit

25

from special education must be provided.

We have that here.

here.

And school nursing services must be provided only

2

if they can be performed by a nurse or other qualified

3

person, not if they must be performed by a physician.
So 24-hour-a-day nursing service while the child

4

is not at school does not qualify, we believe, as a

6

related service, but while he's at school --

QUESTION:

But while the child is at school --

-- full-time nursing care required

Again you'd have to get into

found that an ambulance was there, was needed to prevent

virtually nonexistent risk in this case on the record, but

21

yes.
QUESTION:

22

All right, so I think if I were in

this.

they know a lot more about it than I do.

They'll define it.

service, we're asking the Court -- and I think perhaps the

school district conceded this in their portion of the

related service, that positioning services be recognized

as a related service, and the definition in 1401(a)(17)

I can't find a regulation -- I can

other regulation that defined whether or not a medical

Not by a physician, anyhow.

So therefore, what regulation covers

shouldn't be considered when you define what is or is not

a medical service.

3

QUESTION:

Well, on the other hand, if you say

4

school health service means services provided by a

5

qualified school nurse and that they're provided by the

6

nurse in this case, therefore they're automatically

7

covered, that, it seems to me to be a somewhat circular

definition on your part.

MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

Well, there is also the

10

second half of the definition, Your Honor, qualified

QUESTION:

Well, I guess the statute that we

look to first is probably 20 U.S. Code section

MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

That's, we believe --

such developmental, corrective, and other supportive

19

services, including speech pathology, audiology,

psychological services, physical and occupational therapy

and so forth.

22

Every one of those things, it seems to me, is

something that's given episodically, not continuously.

MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

Justice O'Connor, I think

that's a fair comment.

I think other portions of the

are disabled, regardless of the severity of their

there's statutory definitions for your help, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

2

Okay, and then it defines related

services to mean transportation and such developmental,

corrective, and other supportive services, including blah,

blah, blah, blah, blah, as may be required to assist a

child with disability to benefit from special education.

I mean, I guess keeping him alive would assist

8

him to benefit from special education, but I don't think

9

that's what was meant by related services.
MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

10

No, and again I think the

11

limitation in the Tatro case relates to services provided

12

during the school day to get the child in the front door,

13

to keep them there for the school day, and then to get

14

them home.

QUESTION:

And what's necessary to enable him to

to move around the room, enabling him to use books and so

point.
MR. OELSCHLAEGER:

Then the other cost

19

limitation, Your Honor, and again I think the district's

20

primary position here is the cost, in the Rowley case the

21

Court held that IDEA provides for a floor of educational

22

opportunity.

23

Once the floor is met, if there are better and

more expensive related services that would get a better

and we're not asking for that in this case, so that is an

additional cost limitation we believe contained in the

IDEA, but again, cost just is not a factor in how you

define related service or medical service.

in the institutional placement, and there are reported

what the Court has to focus on is that the services here

are not excluded as medical services because they do not

There are three main reasons why that is

correct.

16

Education's longstanding interpretation, which I will

discuss.

18

First, it's consistent with the Secretary of

Second, that interpretation was adopted by

19

Congress in 1983 when it said no to the Secretary's

20

attempt to broaden the medical exclusion, and when

21

Congress enacted a specific prohibition, section 806 of

That may be in

That's correct.

If I could, I'd like to address the Secretary of

Education's interpretation, and it's very important, I

14

think, to look at that time period when Congress adopted

15

this in 1983, and if you look at the appendix to our brief

16

at page 4a you'll see at the bottom the codified section

is 1407(b), and the heading of that section is lessening

of procedural or substantive protections as in effect on

in effect at that time, and the prior year, 1982, the

No, Your Honor.

there are additional things.

QUESTION:

All right.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

There is that statement in the

14

notice of proposed rule-making in 1982, and that's fully

15

consistent with earlier letters.

16

It had only been since 1977 that the regulation

17

was in place, and at pages 17 to 18 of our brief we talk

18

about the letters the petitioner's counsel referred to

19

about psychotherapy services and the Department had

20

explained there that if those services are administered by

21

a licensed physician, those are excluded medical services,

22

but if there are services provided by other professionals

23

such as a psychiatric social worker, et cetera, those

24

would not be excluded.

Ms. Brinkmann, I find it difficult to

that to be broadcast all over the agency so that when --

I'd like to explain that letter.

I think in order to understand the letter you have to

understand the circumstances.

That letter actually does reinforce the

it's a required related service.

Where does it say there's a bright

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, it doesn't say bright line,

Your Honor, not at all.

You're correct about that, of

course.

this question, and if petitioner were correct, the answer

in that letter would have been, it's excluded medical, end

Well, Ms. Brinkmann, a whole --a

majority of the courts of appeals have rejected your

bright line approach.

QUESTION:

Yes.

certainly will be going against a majority of the Federal

appellate courts.

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, I think to rule

otherwise would clearly be inconsistent with the Court's

ruling in Tatro, and Congress' positive statutory

22

enactment that we cite at page 8a that adopts as a floor

these regulations.

analysis, and also there's just straightforward statements

2

about disagreeing with the policy undergirding the

3

Secretary's regulations, so we think that that's no reason

4

to ignore the Court's precedents about the deference that

5

is owed to the Department of Education.

6

QUESTION:

What are we supposed to do if I

7

think, look, this is a question that cries out for agency

8

interpretation, but the agency doesn't interpret it, so

instead you have seven courts who know little about it

going in 15 different directions.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Again, Your Honor --

What is the -- what is our ability to

cure that problem?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, again Your Honor, I would

15

urge you to look at this letter in the context, if you --

16

you realize that what the agency was explaining is that

17

yes, this is an eligible school health service.

an excluded medical service.

eligible doesn't mean it's a required related service.

It's not

It has to

be decided by the individual education program in the

QUESTION:

2

Your position is clear in your brief.

3

I have seen nothing from the agency that was clear up

until the position that it is now taking in this Court.
MS. BRINKMANN:

5

Your Honor, I would point out in

6

addition to the proposed rule-making that we cite on page

7

22, which I think is the unequivocal statement in those

8

earlier letters about the psychotherapy and the

9

optometrist, that also at the time of this proposed change

10

in the regulation, and Congress' adoption, incorporation,

11

codification, ratification of this regulation, the lower

courts actually agreed with that bright line.

No.

I would like to address

just a couple of questions that were raised of my

That's why

Is there any information in the

population that's covered by this statute, how many

5

children, or what percentage would require the continuous

care?

7

MS. SEITZ:

Unfortunately, there really isn't.

8

The stat -- the Federal statute, unlike our State statute,

9

has specific categories of disabilities.

Most of these

10

children, though not necessarily all of them, would come

11

under other health-impaired, and all we know is that 5

percent of those treated are treated as other health-

impaired, but we don't have any statistics --

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Seitz, if the fact is that

15

if a child needs so much care that the school district

thinks that it can't do it on site, it may cost the school
