ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERNA L. WILLIAMS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

At issue in this case is whether title IX's

12

broad prohibition against sex discrimination requires

13

schools to remedy and address student-to-student sexual

14

harassment.

15

The Eleventh Circuit has decided that title IX

16

imposes no obligations on schools to remedy this type of

17

discrimination, no matter how severe or pervasive the

18

harassment, no matter how cognizant school officials are

19

-- are of it, no matter how capable officials were of

20

remedying the harassment.

21

schools simply cannot be held accountable under title IX

22

either in court or in the administrative enforcement

23

context for -- for refusing to address this

24

discrimination.

25

IX and with this Court's interpretations of the statute.

Under this blanket rule,

This result cannot be squared with title

QUESTION:

1

May I ask, Ms. Williams, how you

2

would propose to cabin this cause of action were we to

3

agree with you?
I'm sure that school children nationwide tease

4
5

each other, and little boys tease little girls, and so

6

forth throughout their years in school.

7

of those incidents going to lead to some kind of a

8

lawsuit?

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

And is every one

No, Your Honor.

The legal

10

framework that has developed in this area provides

11

standards for determining what constitutes sexual

12

harassment and what isn't sexual harassment.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

What standards would you think would

govern to cabin this kind of a cause of action?
MS. WILLIAMS:

First, I would recommend looking

16

at the title VII standards.

17

title VII standards inform whether sex -- sexual

18

harassment is sex discrimination under title IX.

19

under those standards, a particular instance isn't sexual

20

harassment unless it is severe, it's pervasive, unless it

21

is sufficiently -- unless it is objectively offensive to a

22

reasonable person, unless it is offensive to the person

23

who has experienced the sexual harassment.

24
25

QUESTION:

The Court said in Gebser that

And

Gee, but little girls always tease

little boys and little boys always tease little girls.

That's pervasive.
MS. WILLIAMS:

It's pervasive, but it is not

QUESTION:

In my experience, it's -- it's

severe.

MS. WILLIAMS:

7

QUESTION:

But it doesn't always --

Are you going to apply a reasonable

8

-- a reasonable teenager standard?

9

criteria?
MS. WILLIAMS:

10

Is that -- is that the

Well, the Department of Education

11

has applied the title VII standards and given

12

consideration as to how they would apply to the education

13

context.

14

age-appropriate measures.

15

So, they do recommend that school officials use

QUESTION:

But the important --

The concern -- the concern is I think

16

that if you simply take the same standards of title VII,

17

i.e., anything that would be sexual harassment in the work

18

place, when done by a co-worker or a supervisor to a

19

subordinate or a co-worker, that which is sexual

20

harassment there is also sexual harassment for which the

21

school district is liable when a 7-year-old does it to a

22

6-year-old or a 13-year-old to a 12-year-old.

23

is, as you've said, you take the same standards.

24

would remove what is a pervasive problem in the schools

25

from the hands of educators and psychologists and give

that problem to lawyers and judges.
Now, I don't think the latter is the right group
of people to solve it.

Perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't.

But I want to bring out into the open what I

5

think is the problem or a problem, and I want to know how

6

you -- anything you could say that would reassure me or

7

others that -- how -- that this would -- what I've just

8

said may not be the case.

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

We understand the concern and we

10

think that, first of all, the title VII standards wouldn't

11

apply wholesale in the education context.

12

to -- they would inform the analysis of sexual harassment

13

in the first instance.

They would have

14

And the second thing is that title IX doesn't

15

require schools to be successful in addressing student-

16

to-student sexual harassment.

17

being held out of compliance with title IX, the school

18

would need to take reasonable steps to remedy and address

19

the sexual harassment.

20

QUESTION:

In other words, to avoid

I think then that every school

21

district in the Nation should adopt guidelines and codes,

22

as we've suggested for employers.

23

Do you think there was a suggestion in the

24

congressional debates and in the text of this statute that

25

there would be Federal standards for school behavior in

2

MS. WILLIAMS:

We're not suggesting that there

3

are Federal standards for school behavior.

4

suggesting -QUESTION:

5
6

We are

I thought this was a Federal statute

we're talking about.
MS. WILLIAMS:

7

Well, we are talking about a

8

Federal statute, but the Federal statute imposes the

9

obligation on educational institutions to ensure that no

10

person is excluded from participation in, denied the

11

benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under the

12

education program or activity.
QUESTION:

13

Now, let's -- let's -- let's be very

14

careful here.

If you're going to have standards, they're

15

Federal standards, are they not?

16

MS. WILLIAMS:

17

QUESTION:

Thank you.

18

QUESTION:

Do you really think it -- it -- it

Yes.

19

imposes an obligation on these educational institutions to

20

prevent anyone being denied the benefits of or excluded

21

from participation in, that's what it requires every

22

school district to do?

23

25

MS. WILLIAMS:

The -- the -- the prohibition is

broad.

2

their daughter to study science because they think girls

3

shouldn't study science?

4

responsibility of the school district to prevent that?

5

MS. WILLIAMS:

Title IX makes it the

The parents wouldn't be persons

6

that are under control of the institution.

7

that instance, title IX wouldn't have -- wouldn't require

8

schools to step in to -- to deal with that situation.

9

QUESTION:

And so, in

I -- I suppose the -- the parents are

10

under the control of the institution to the extent that

11

the institution decides what course ultimately the student

2

will take.

3

is -- is depriving this child from taking science, because

4

the parents feel that the girl shouldn't have science,

5

surely the institution can prevent that.

6

And if the institution knows that the parent

MS. WILLIAMS:

Title IX doesn't impose an

7

obligation on the school to act in that instance any more

8

than title VII would require an institution to step in if

9

a husband didn't want his wife to work in a nontraditional

20
21

occupation in the public employment sector.
QUESTION:

So, you think the language cannot be

22

read literally, that it -- it in fact does not mean that

23

no one -- when it says no one shall be deprived of the

24

benefits of or subjected to discrimination under, it

25

doesn't mean that it's the responsibility of the school to

The -- the parent -- the school has

MS. WILLIAMS:

articulated, that title IX would not impose an obligation

Correct?

MS. WILLIAMS:

QUESTION:

Yes, that would be part of --

All right.

Why in Justice Scalia's

QUESTION:

Well, neither is the student in every

requires that the action of harassment be done by an agent

MS. WILLIAMS:

QUESTION:

9

Is it possible that title IX liability

No.

No, Your Honor.

In Gebser, of course, it was a

teacher and the teacher was an agent of the district.

So,

10

certainly it's possible then that liability would be

11

focused on those who are agents of the district.

12

Liability of the district would depend upon actions of an

13

agent.

14

MS. WILLIAMS:

We submit that Gebser rejected

15

holdings -- holding schools liable for the independent

16

actions of teachers, and in that case the Court was asked

17

to adopt a theory of vicarious liability that would be

18

dependent upon the agents --

QUESTION:

No.

It -- it required the

20

intentional action of the school district, but it also

happened to involve action by an agent.

MS. WILLIAMS:

4

Would the school

If a school district -- if school

5

officials, the appropriate school officials, had actual

6

notice of that type of misconduct and they responded to it

7

with deliberate indifference, they would be accountable.

8

They would be held accountable under title IX.
I think that the -- the Seventh Circuit's

9
10

opinion in Doe v. University of Illinois does provide a

11

cabining concept that you were asking about, Your Honor,

12

in that the liability would -- would attach to those

13

situations that are happening in school or in school

14

activities or school sponsored activities.

15

help to, I think, address in part Justice Scalia's

16

question.

17

And that would

But the important thing to remember is that the

18

statute does require that institutions not subject persons

19

to discrimination, and the Court's decision in Gebser

20

shows that the appropriate analysis in large part is an

21

examination of how the school responded to the

22

discrimination when it was made aware of it.

That's right, but it was carried out

harasser's relationship to the institution to make the

ultimate determination of whether damages liability would

QUESTION:

Ms. Williams, I thought your position

6

was not that there's responsibility for what the child

It was the school's conduct and not the fifth grade

So, it is no answer -- you're right -- for me to

some way for the law to be sensitive to that other than

What's worrying is the gearing up of the great legal

14

mechanism to supersede that.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

discussions, counseling sessions, training, conciliation

I mean, what Justice O'Connor I think

was suggesting possibly is the possibility of creating a

standard that's strict enough to stop the administrative
problem that you're worried about.

Now, suppose you did

combine what she suggested, which is that the school

district needs actual knowledge and virtually doesn't

respond at all, with what I think was implicit in your

opponent's suggestion that maybe the harassment would have

to rise to the level of a significant denial of the

program's benefit.

significant denial of the program's benefit so it isn't

that the school district has to actually know and its

MR. PLOWDEN:

If Your Honor please, no matter

what the standard, how high the test or where you set the

be self-defeating in terms of the use of Federal funds to

QUESTION:

It's not -- it's not only money.

4

Isn't it -- isn't it a necessary consequence of the

5

position the petitioners argued that there will be a

6

Federal code of conduct in every classroom in the country?

7

MR. PLOWDEN:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Precisely my

8

point.

What will happen here is -- and it's a backward

9

looking and a forward looking situation, if you will.

10

For the case that's made it into court, the

11

Federal district judge has got to deal with the issue.

12

Regardless of how high the bar is set, what the test is,

13

there's got to be a review on some basis looking back at

14

the action or alleged inaction, whatever you call it, of

15

the school officials and response to the reports of

16

harassment by the student.

17

On a going forward basis, school administrators,

18

school board attorneys are going to have to constantly

19

refine and fine tune the punishment provisions in their

20

discipline codes in order to make sure that they --

21

they're protected for the next case that comes along.

22

When the -- when the district court somewhere decides,

23

well, this was not enough, then we may need to adjust our

24

punishment, and as the principal in this case said, get

25

down on them a little harder.

So, you've -- you've got

both of those problems.
You've also, in -- in the course of doing this,

2

3

focused the attention of the administrators, teachers,

4

school officials into the courthouse into the litigation

5

process and away from the school function, the school

6

program which, after all, is the object of these various

7

Federal grants that we're talking about here.
QUESTION:

8

Mr. Plowden, I understand the -- the

9

problem that people have been wrestling with, that is, how

0

do you draw the line between rough-stuff teasing and

11

harassment that's covered.

But on the other hand,

I don't

2

understand why it's so hard to separate negligence from

3

deliberate indifference, that it means you have to know

4

and you have to deliberately not do anything about it.

5

seems to me that that's not a hard standard to define and

6

apply.

7

MR. PLOWDEN:

It

I'm not suggesting so much that

8

the difference there is hard to apply as I am saying that

9

it has to be applied at all because once you get into the

20

courthouse, whatever that standard might be that you would

21

adopt, it's got to be applied in court with children

22

testifying about the pervasiveness or lack of it here or
