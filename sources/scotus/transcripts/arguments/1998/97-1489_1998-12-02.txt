ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIANA L. GUSTIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. GUSTIN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner is here today to complain about an

12

13

insurance company.

14

a fiscal intermediary serving as the agent for the

15

Government, reviewing medicare cost reports, making

16

determinations about allowable cost, and also making

17

decisions about whether or not the cost report may be

18

reopened.

19

In this case the insurance company is

In this case, the petitioner, a home health

20

agency, discovered new and material evidence after the

21

initial period for requesting appeal, and therefore made a

22

request for a reopening of the cost report.

23

The intermediary, the insurance company, denied

24

the request to reopen, considered this a final

25

determination, and then we filed an appeal for review of

that final agency action at the Provider Reimbursement

2

Review Board.
The review board declined to accept the case,

3
4

stating it did not have jurisdiction to review the refusal

5

to reopen.

6

decision of the board and the Sixth Circuit also upheld

7

the district court, which brings us here today.

8

9

The district court upheld the jurisdictional

We would like to begin with the statement that
there is a presumption that there will be judicial review

10

of final agency action, and this presumption is noted in

11

the Court's decision of Bowen v. Michigan Academy of

12

Family Physicians, where the Court's opinion started with

13

saying, we begin with a strong presumption that Congress

14

intends judicial review of administrative action.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but you had one round of

16

judicial -- of administrative review here, didn't you,

17

with the right to appeal to the district court?

18

MS. GUSTIN:

We had an opportunity, a chance to

19

make a request for an appeal, but based upon the

20

information that we had at that time, an appeal was not

21

sought, but when we discovered new and material evidence

22

which we believe shows that the intermediary violated its

23

own regulations, upon discovery of the new and material

24

evidence, we believe that gives us the right to request

25

the reopening, and if that reopening is unlawfully

1

withheld, we sought review, and so it's the review of the

2

refusal, which is final agency action, which we are

3

seeking.

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Gustin, you know, there has to be

5

an end to litigation at some point, and I thought the

6

normal rule is, when there's a final judgment, you can

7

come back and say, you know, there are new circumstances,

8

but whether to open for that reason is discretionary.

9

The Administrative Procedure Act has an

10

exception for judicial review for matters committed to

11

agency discretion by law, and I have always thought that

12

it's committed to agency discretion whether to reopen a

13

closed case.

14
15

They always can, but I don't think anybody has a
right to it.

16

MS. GUSTIN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Well -And if they decide not to, that's the

end of the matter.
MS. GUSTIN:

Your Honor, in this Court's

20

decision in ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,

21

which was decided in 1977, this Court held that a refusal

22

to reopen which was based upon new and material evidence

23

should have some sort of review, because otherwise --

24
25

QUESTION:
provided for removal.

Ms. Gustin, the statute in that case
I mean, for reopening.

MS. GUSTIN:

2

QUESTION:

That is
Here, as I understand it, the statute

3

says nothing.

The statute says, get your act together in

4

180 days.

5

reopening, but it's going to be just this one shot, no

6

review.

The Secretary then said, yeah, I'll provide for

7

MS. GUSTIN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

11

Well -So how can you compare a case where

Congress said, you have a right to reopen, to a case where
Congress made no such provision.
MS. GUSTIN:

Well, first of all, I think that

12

there is a statutory provision within the medicare statute

13

which requires reopening.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. GUSTIN:

And which one is that?
And that would be section

16

1395x(v)(1)(A), clause (ii).

17

QUESTION:

But that refers to reopening when the

18

year's books have finally been closed so that you could

19

tell what the actual charges were, and the Secretary gave

20

you that opportunity, didn't she?

21

MS. GUSTIN:

Well, whether or not that refers to

22

just a year-end book-balancing I think has not been

23

decided by this Court, but in fact the Secretary uses that

24

reopening process for more than simply a year-end book­

25

balancing to compare estimated cost with actual cost, and

1

so we would say first of all to Justice Ginsburg's

2

question, there is statutory authority for a reopening

3

within that.

4

Secondly --

QUESTION:

But if we read the statute to say

5

what it does, it provides for the year-end adjustment, and

6

that's all it provides for, then you don't have any such

7

argument.
MS. GUSTIN:

8

9

If you read the statute that way,

but I would impress upon the Court that in this case in

10

particular the Secretary used the reopening process beyond

11

that year-end book-balancing period, and the Secretary

12

routinely uses the reopening process beyond that simple

13

year-end --

14

QUESTION:

The reopening process.

What Justice

15

Ginsburg's suggesting is that there are two reopening

16

processes.

17

reopening, and the other is the normal discretion that any

18

agency has, but a nonreviewable discretion, to reopen a

19

closed matter if it thinks it to be a good idea.

20

One is the statutory requirement for

MS. GUSTIN:

Well, I don't think that there --

21

that it's clearly stated that Congress wanted a - - an

22

unreviewable, completely insulated final agency action,

23

and I think that the decision in Michigan Academy talks at

24

great length about the fact that the presumption to

25

judicial review is so important that we cannot just think

that Congress meant something not to be reopened that it

requires - QUESTION:

But you can come back 10 years later,

even after you've gotten this review.

to reopen.

later.

10

Then you find something else, 10 years

She says, get out of here, it's 10 years

You have judicial review of that again, right?
MS. GUSTIN:

QUESTION:

12

MS. GUSTIN:

13

QUESTION:

15

I believe that is correct, Your

Honor.

11

14

Let's assume we

Well -As the Ninth Circuit held -Life is too short for this kind of

thing.
MS. GUSTIN:

First of all, in regard to the 10-

16

year time frame that you put on that, I think that that

17

would only apply in cases where there was fraud or abuse

18

alleged, because there's normally a 3-year time period to

19

request a reopening, and the Secretary --

20

QUESTION:

Suppose the Secretary said, I'm going

21

to withdraw that regulation.

22

what Congress wrote, there is no right to reopen, period.

23

You do it within 80 days, and if you don't have your act

24

together by then, it's tough luck.

25

MS. GUSTIN:

Forget it.

I'll stick with

Well, I think that having your act

together is really the problem here, because it wasn't a

2

matter of whether or not we had our act together.

3

a matter of information that the intermediary had or had

4

access to that we did not have access to, and this -QUESTION:

So perhaps Congress was mistaken in

making the period 180 days.

period.
MS. GUSTIN:

8

9

It was

But that was Congress'

I think Congress was not mistaken,

but I think that Congress had the section that I

10

referenced earlier, 1395x(v)(1)(A), clause (ii), which

11

allows for corrective retroactive adjustments when a

12

provider is either underpaid or overpaid, and that's been

13

a part of the act from the beginning, but I think that

14

the - QUESTION:

15

Yes, but we already understand that

16

if that is -- has the narrow meaning that seems to have

17

been given to it by this Court it isn't across-the-board

18

reopening.

19

MS. GUSTIN:

Well, in the Court's decision that

20

discussed that provision of the statute, whether or not

21

the book-balancing occurred at -- within the 180 days,

22

which would be the narrow meaning, was not really

23

discussed in terms of the time period for the retroactive

24

corrective adjustments, and to the contrary --

1

covered, not the time, what can be covered by that

2

explicit statutory provision, and I thought that provision

3

was confined to the annual overlook of the month-by-month.

4

MS. GUSTIN:

Well, I don't believe that that

5

provision should be confined to that and, indeed, it's not

6

in practicality.

7

As I stated in this case, beyond that 180-day

8

time period, this cost report was reopened, because we had

9

discovered that a nurse did not have an appropriate

10

license, so we reported that to the intermediary, and then

11

the costs for the visits had to be reduced, and so the

12

narrow view of the year-end book-balancing happening only

13

to do that balancing between interim payments and final

14

payments - -

The intermediary reopened.
Yes, and I gather that's essentially

what your position is.

19

23

Who reopened in that case?

The intermediary can reopen.
Yes.

The Secretary can reopen.
Yes.
It's only fair that you should be

allowed to.
MS. GUSTIN:

Yes, because if we discover

wrongful acts that unfairly deprived us of reimbursement

1

to which we were entitled under the act, then we should

2

also be allowed to claim the recovery.

3
4

QUESTION:

That's an argument in fairness and in

equity, but you have a statute to deal with.

5

MS. GUSTIN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. GUSTIN:

Yes.
And regulations to deal with, and -And we believe that the statute

8

itself at 1395oo clearly states that Congress intended

9

that we have an appeal process after a final

10

determination, and that that language is clear, a final

11

determination, and it is only through the Secretary's

12

interpretation of that phrase to mean one, and only one

13

kind of a final determination, that she prohibits or

14

restricts our ability to obtain review.

15

And so we believe under the Chevron test the

16

plain meaning of the statute must govern first of all.

17

final determination is what Congress said, and we have a

18

final determination, and indeed it makes sense that final

19

determinations of this nature should proceed --

20

QUESTION:

A

My notion of a final determination is

21

a final decision on the merits of the claim.

A final

decision was entered.

2

60(b), but you still have a final judgment.
MS. GUSTIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

3

under 60(b) courts have held in the Sixth Circuit that a

4

refusal to grant the relief sought under 60(b) when there

5

is no new and material evidence can be reviewed, but only

6

as to whether or not there was an abuse of discretion,

7

because otherwise - -

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Yeah, and it could be reviewed here,

too, if Congress -- Congress had provided for reopening
and said, and it's reviewable.
MS. GUSTIN:

Well, I believe that Congress

12

provided for review by stating that a fin^l determination

13

as to total program reimbursement can be reviewed if you

14

take the appropriate steps, and the refusal to reopen is a

15

final determination as to program reimbursement, so I

16

believe that we meet the definition under the statute

17

itself, and I believe that that's also where the

1-8

presumption to judicial review comes back, because the

19

statutory language I believe is clear.

20

But if you believe you must interpret the

21

language in the statute, then the burden is upon the

22

Secretary by clear and convincing proof to show that

23

Congress did not want judicial review, and there is no

24

language in the congressional history which states that

25

they considered whether or not there would be a reopening

1

process and that that should be totally and completely up

2

to the discretion of the insurance company employee.

3

We don't even have a governmental entity

4

reviewing the request to reopen.

We have private

5

insurance companies that contract with the Government, and

6

we don't know anything about the individuals who are

7

making these decisions, so we would be leaving within the

8

discretion of one person decisions that could be worth

9

millions of dollars to hospitals.

I don't think there's

10

anything in the Congressional Record to indicate that they

11

wanted that to be the case, and --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

But you have the right to review

these decisions before it becomes final, do you not?
MS. GUSTIN:

You -- based upon what you know at

15

that time, and I think it's important to understand that

16

my client and other providers should surely have the right

17

to rely upon the intermediary to act lawfully and to give

18

us the information that they are making the decision upon,

19

but when they don't give us the information, or give us

20

the wrong information, whether it is intentional or by

21

mistake, and we discover it later, that we should have a

22

right to request a reopening.

23

QUESTION:

But think -- you know, this is a

24

tremendously complicated and extensive system, and these

25

matters have to come to an end sooner or later.

MS. GUSTIN:

1

Exactly, and I think the 3-year

2

period within which you can request a reopening is an

3

appropriate time period to expect the provider to act,

4

unless, for example, there is fraud or intentional

5

wrongdoing, which I mentioned, and there's no time period

6

under the regulation for requesting reopening in that

7

case.

QUESTION:

MS. GUSTIN:

Yes, and we say that the final

which goes to the total amount of program reimbursement,

which is what the statute defines --

QUESTION:

No more so than in my hypothetical.

beyond the 3-year period which will affect the total

answer that in terms of how it applies to this argument.
QUESTION:

Of course you know how to answer it.

18

You have to answer it that yes, it's reviewable because

it's a final determination.

20

MS. GUSTIN:

Well then it's reviewable because

21

it's a final determination as to the total amount of

22

program reimbursement, but we have a regulation here.

that the 3-year period was what was important, but with

What I have a hard time seeing is how you

mind that we have had a final, the equivalent of a final

adjudication on the merits of the claim.

17

MS. GUSTIN:

I think it's important, Your Honor,

18

to focus upon the abuse of discretion that is possible in

deciding whether or not a final determination can be more

than simply the first notice of program reimbursement

MS. GUSTIN:

Well, there are arguments in the

alternative, Your Honor, because first and foremost we

believe that the statute itself allows us judicial review,

alternative way of looking at this, because we believe

there must be some kind of review, because Congress did

not prohibit review of this final agency action and,

4

indeed, when -QUESTION:

5

I think -- I think that's what

6

perhaps bothers some of us, is that in your view any time

7

you come in, whether it's, you know, 6 months after the

8

final order or 2 years after the final order, and say I

9

want a reopening, that becomes a new final order, and I

10

really don't think the presumption of review that you're

11

talking about extends that far.

12

MS. GUSTIN:

I don't think that the broader

13

reading of any time you come in is applicable here, and I

14

don't think it's necessary to view this case in those

terms.

16

I think it's appropriate to have a reasonable

time period to limit the reopening, just like it's

1

filled that gap with her regulation, and I think that's an

2

appropriate time period, and the Secretary uses that time

3

period and has relied upon it and convinced this Court

4

that millions of dollars can be recovered from hospitals

5

within that 3-year time period under the graduate medical

6

education regulation in Regions Hospital.

7

And I think that Congress wanted the providers

8

to stand on an even footing with the Secretary in regard

9

to these corrective retroactive adjustments, and that's

10

why the language in the statue says that providers or the

11

Secretary may have corrective retroactive adjustments when

2

the provider's payments have been excessive or when they

3

have been underpaid.

4

Congress gave us either situation, but the

5

Secretary's reading turns that system upside down and

6

makes it so that the Secretary only has that right,

because we have no right to correct the Secretary's action

for this Court, and the only way that we discovered this

is when we hired a CPA who had represented other clients

language supports that for two -- basically two reasons,

2

and that is because it is the Secretary's regulations, not

3

the Medicare Act itself, that provides the opportunity to

4

seek reopening, and we think it does further the interest

5

of administrative finality.

6

And this Court reached a quite similar

7

conclusion in the Califano v. Sanders case, when the Court

8

held that there was no judicial review for refusals to

9

reopen social security benefit determinations, and the

10

Court said that for two reasons.

11

One was the opportunity to reopen was afforded

12

solely by the Secretary's regulations and not the Social

13

Security Act, and a contrary reading would frustrate

14

Congress' intent to impose a specific time limit on the

15

review of the initial decision.

16

And this complaint about an anomaly with

reopening under the Medicare Act is no different under the

Social Security Act.

opportunity to seek reopening, and it may or may not get

granted but there's no right of review and, of course, the

claimant will get review.

MS. BLATT:

The other reason why, that there's not an

and there are, as we said in our acquiescence to the

administrative as well as financial burden on the system

MS. BLATT:

1

The simple truth of the matter is,

2

the Secretary administers this program -- there are 38

3

intermediaries -- and has no access to the hospital's

4

records.
The hospital, on the other hand, are by and

5

very good about appealing within the 180 days.

They have

This case is particularly instructive, because

10

here the petitioner protested the $50,000 that's at issue

13

there is no reason why the provider did not appeal.

This was a red flag that the

2

intermediary with respect to production.
And again, like I said, there's just no reason

3
4

There's no reason to presume bad faith on the

that the provider didn't appeal in this case.
If I could also turn to clause (ii), if I could

5
6

refer to it that way, and that's 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii), which

7

this Court referred to as clause (ii) in the Good

8

Samaritan case, we think that that -- that this decision

9

squarely forecloses any argument that clause (ii) is the

10

basis for reopening and requires a reopening procedure.
What the Court held in Good Samaritan was that

11
12

clause (ii) is ambiguous, and it upheld the Secretary's

13

narrow reading as a year-end, and the Court several times

14

referred to it as a year-end book-balancing accounting

15

reconciliation, and that's -- that would reconcile the

16

amounts paid to the provider during the year that were

17

simply estimates, pre-audit, periodic payments with the

18

amount that the NPR determined to be allowable.

19

And that's -- actually, if you look at the NPR

20

in this case, it shows that reconciliation, and I think

21

it's on page -- I think it's -- it's page 36 of the joint

22

appendix, so this is how the Secretary administers the

23

program.

24
25

This is how the regulations work.
A reopening procedure is something entirely

distinct from that.

It's a substantive redetermination,
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

or at least a request to redetermine what had been

2

reimbursable.

3

If I could also address the issue that these are

4

private insurance companies, these are intermediaries

5

making the decision, these are the Secretary's agents and

6

they do act under her close oversight and supervision, and

7

we think it's also significant that intermediaries are

8

nominated by the providers themselves, and if there's some

9

suspicion that the intermediary is biased or unfair the

10

provider is always free to request a change in the

11

intermediary, or not nominate the intermediary.

12

There's simply no allegation in this case that

13

intermediaries act distinctively with bad faith with

14

respect to reopening as opposed to any other initial

15

decision and, of course, the provider and all hospitals

16

have the opportunity to challenge the initial underlying

17

determination within the 6-month time period.

18

Then if I could also address the question of

19

Section 1331 jurisdiction, in addition to the plain

20

language of section 405(h), the third sentence, which

21

forecloses any action arising under the Medicare Act, this

22

Court in Heckler v. Ringer and again in Weinberger v.

23

Salfi made clear that the Court was not going to look at

24

procedural labels or substantive labels, but would look at

25

whether the standing and substantive basis for the claim

And so I'm not sure the provider -- the provider

3

in this case talks about a collateral challenge.

4

not from any decision -- that doesn't come from any

5

decision of this Court.

The only exception,

Academy exception or distinction has any relevance to this

18

case, when there was a full right of review.

19

And again,

I would also remind the Court about

20

the Sanders decision where, under the Social Security Act,

21

there is no right of review, and the Court made clear in

22

that case that 1331 was -- excuse me,

1

the mandamus aspect of this, which the petitioner also

2

relies on, we think mandamus is barred by the second

3

sentence of section 405(h), but in all events there is no

4

basis for seeking mandamus relief in this case.

5

The two challenges are, of course, the refusal

6

to reopen, and then the underlying complaint about the

7

owner's compensation.

8

the part of the intermediary.

9

Both of those require discretion on

The regulations are in the manual.

It's plain

10

on its face that the decision whether to reopen is

11

discretionary, and certainly the question about whether

12

costs are reasonable and allowable under the statute also

13

requires the exercise of discretion.

14

And as to the underlying claim about entitlement

15

to reimbursement, certainly there's no question that the

16

petitioner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies

17

by not appealing within the time frame.

If there are no further questions, that
completes my argument.
