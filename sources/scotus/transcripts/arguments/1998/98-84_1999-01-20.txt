ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here from the Third Circuit which

2

held that the NCAA would be covered by title IX if it

3

received dues from member institutions which receive

4

Federal financial assistance.

5

should be reversed.

6

That decision is wrong and

It's wrong because this Court has held that for

7

an entity to be covered by title IX, or any of the other

8

statutes with the same Federal funding trigger, the entity

9

must itself be a recipient of Federal financial

20
21

assistance.
The Court said just that in the Paralyzed

22

Veterans case.

23

law to those who actually receive Federal financial

24

assistance.

25

Court said that these laws, quoting again, require us to

And it also explained why that is so.

In the Grove City case, Your

Honor, but the test is the same.

recipient or an indirect recipient, the entity must be the

9

intended recipient under the grant statute or program.

And the reason for that is clear, the condition -- the

prohibition on discrimination is imposed as a condition on

MR. ROBERTS:

10

Directly or through, a reference

QUESTION:

2

Well,

if we didn't have Paralyzed

Veterans or Grove -- the Grove case, would you read the

regulation naturally your way so that there has to be an

5

intent?

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Well,

I think --

I don't see where you get that from

the face of the regulation if we talk just about that.

recognize you have the gloss of the case.

1

recipient of the Federal grant.

2

Paralyzed Veterans in the easy case, if the grant statute

3

extends money, quote, then the recipient is the entity

4

that receives the money.
QUESTION:

5

What the Court said in

Suppose I'm giving -- I'm given

6

money.

7

anywhere I want and I spend them at a particular grocery

8

store.

9

store was an indirect recipient of the -- of the food

10

I'm given food stamps.

And I can spend them

Wouldn't it be proper English to say the grocery

stamps?
MR. ROBERTS:

11

The key is whether there is a

12

Spending Clause contract between the recipient and the

13

Federal Government whereby the recipient agrees to accept

14

the conditions, the prohibitions on discrimination, in

15

exchange for accepting the Federal funds.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, was there a contract in Grove

City?

the case was about.

There was, yes.

With the institution.

That's what

I thought it was simply the -- I

thought -- I guess I stand corrected.

25

institution to get the money, and it was, in effect, the

1

-- the specific intent to have the money end up with X

2

that made X liable --

3

MR. ROBERTS:

What the -- what was the issue in

4

the case was whether the university had to execute the --

5

the contract that the Government gave it.

6

what the litigation was over, and the Court said yes.

7

And it said yes because in deciding who the

That's what --

8

recipient is, you look to what the statute says, and here

9

it said this is for institutions of higher education.

10
11
12
13

This is all the money could be spent on.
QUESTION:

So, the fact --

It's basically the intent in

appropriating the money that's the criterion.
MR. ROBERTS:

In the underlying grant statute,

14

as the Court said in Paralyzed Veterans, and in all of the

15

briefs filed on the respondent's side of this case, you

16

will not find analysis of an underlying grant statute that

17

says, this is to extend financial assistance to the NCAA.

18

That's the key element that is called for by this Court's

19

decision and it's missing from all the arguments on the

20

other side because there is no grant statute that extends

21

Federal financial assistance to the NCAA.

A

22

Now, the --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, what there is is a

24

significant difference between the relationship of the

up of the recipients in the way that the NCAA's membership

2

is largely recipients.

3

said, it didn't have that picture in view, that is, an

4

entity composed largely of constituents that are -- are

5

subject to title IX as direct recipients.

MR. ROBERTS:

6

So, whatever Paralyzed Veterans

The -- the NCAA is an association

7

of its members, and most of its members, as Your Honor

8

points out, do receive Federal financial assistance.

9

the association does not, and the -- the colleges as a

But

10

collective group, with respect to their intercollegiate

11

athletic activities, does not receive Federal financial

12

assistance.

13

responsible and covered under title IX.

14

not.

The individual colleges do and they remain
But the NCAA does

-V

15

And the Third Circuit's reasoning that they're

16

somehow covered simply because the members pay dues

17

presents the exact problem the Court was concerned about

18

in Paralyzed Veterans, that if you depart from the

19

Spending Clause contract, the entity that has accepted the

20

condition because it has accepted the funds, then you --

21

once you sever title IX from those moorings in the

22

Spending Clause, it has almost limitless coverage because

program that grants monies to colleges and for -- for a

area.

the money put a hundred percent of the money into an

association that's somewhat like the NCAA.

5

association be covered?

6

And a hundred percent of the colleges that receive

MR. ROBERTS:

Would that

No, because again that's the --

7

the lesson of Paralyzed Veterans.

You don't just follow

8

the money or follow the Federal financial assistance to an

9

ultimate beneficiary.

The colleges would remain liable

10

for any discriminatory acts of theirs, but the separate

11

entity that they formed would only be covered if that

12

entity accepted Federal financial assistance and thereby

13

accepted the Spending Clause condition that goes along

14

with the assistance.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, there is some argument

16

on the other side that, well, all this doesn't matter

17

anyway because the NCAA gets money from the National Youth

18

Sports Program fund as a direct recipient.

19

deal with that question here or what?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

22

23

Now, do we

It was --

And is that -- is that a federally

constituted fund?
MR. ROBERTS:

The issue of the National Youth

Sports Program was not addressed either by the district

25

court or by the Third Circuit below, and I don't think

1

that this Court should address it, at least not in the --

2

in the first instance.

3

addressed by the Third Circuit because it wasn't raised

4

before the district court.

It wasn't -- presumably wasn't

5

QUESTION:

What do you mean it wasn't raised?

6

Was evidence concerning it --

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROBERTS:

The only evidence --

-- in the record?
The only evidence in the record

10

concerning the National Youth Sports Program was an

11

affidavit filed by an NCAA officer that establishes that

12

it's a separate Missouri corporation.

13

and that the NCAA receives no money from the NYSP.

14

the only evidence of record in this case concerning that

15

-- that fund.

16

QUESTION:

It's not the NCAA,
That's

The evidence was also that it was

17

once the NCAA directly and then it was set up as a

18

separate fund, but when the program was new, the money

19

went directly to the NCAA, didn't it?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, and then -- then a separate

21

corporation was established to administer the grant, not

22

the NCAA, which makes perfect sense because what the

23

National Youth Sports Program does is not -- doesn't

24

concern intercollegiate athletics.

25

that's part of -- central to the NCAA's mission.

It's not something

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Anyway, that was not explored below.
It was never addressed by either

16

court below, and the fact that it wasn't has led to some

17

confusion as to exactly what the claim is.

18

whether the claim is sort of a veil-piercing claim that

19

somehow the NYSP is the NCAA, which the allegations

20

certainly don't support because that issue goes to

21

observance of corporate formalities and the like, and

22

there's no suggestion that that hasn't occurred.

23

the allegation simply that the NCAA is an indirect

24

recipient through the NYSP, which would raise the same

25

issues as the dues.

It's not clear

Or is

There's no suggestion that the money

that's extended to the NYSP is intended to be received or
extended to the NCAA.
QUESTION:

Well, there's a -- more of a question

of the separateness of the two when it's just the NCAA and
the NYSP than when you have -MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

And those claims --

-- hundreds of colleges and

universities.
MR. ROBERTS:

And those -- as I say, those

claims have never been tested in either court below
because they weren't raised.
QUESTION:

And the -- and the court below didn't

test either the theory that there was a joint venture
among the colleges and universities to -- to confer on the
NCAA the authority for operating the schools'
intercollegiate programs.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the Third Circuit referred

to the NCAA as something of a surrogate for the schools in
-- in this regard.

But here again -- and the Government's

own regulation establishes that -- it's not enough that
you're involved somehow in operating an educational
program or activity.

Countless non-recipients do that in

schools across the country.

You must also be -- and the

regulation says this -- an entity to whom Federal
financial assistance is extended.

So, the fact that the

NCAA may play some role in intercollegiate athletics and

2

that intercollegiate athletics may be a program or

activity of the colleges and universities, not of the

4

NCAA, because to be a program or activity under the

5

statute, you must receive Federal financial assistance -QUESTION:

this case.

Is the NCAA a 501(c)(3) organization?
MR. ROBERTS:

8

9

Mr. Roberts, there's one aspect of

It is tax exempt, yes.

I'm not

quite sure whether it's -QUESTION:

10

Well, my question is -- is whether,

11

independent of title IX -- under the Fifth and Fourteenth

12

Amendment and the Bob Jones decision, isn't the NCAA under

13

an obligation not to discriminate in order to retain its

14

tax exempt status?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, well, first of all, it's

16

important to appreciate the NCAA firmly endorses and

17

embraces the principles of title IX, believes it does not

18

violate that in any way, and conducts its activities to

19

promote gender equity.

20

Now, the position -- the question of whether the

21

tax exempt status is -- is -- can be brought into question

22

because of its activities is -- is a separate one and it's

distinct.

QUESTION:

Well, the --

Is that -- is that the nub of the

MR. ROBERTS:

The allegation is that waivers

13

were given disproportionately to one gender as opposed to

14

another, which we of course dispute on the merits, but the

15

merits are not before the Court because the NCAA is not a

16

Federal funding recipient.

17

This, by the way, used to be the position of the

18

Government.

When the HEW issued regulations in 1975, it

19

told the colleges in the area of intercollegiate athletics

20

that you have the obligation not to discriminate, and they

21

issued a regulation that said, and you're not -- that

22

obligation isn't obviated or alleviated by any athletic

23

association rule.

24

And the colleges squawked about that and they

25

said, well, you know, what -- if there's an association

rule that says one thing and title IX says the other, that

2

doesn't seem right.

said, look, you are the members of this association.

4

they have a rule that causes you problems complying with

5

title IX, change the rule.

And HEW stuck to its guns and it
If

6

And then when the NCAA challenged these

7

regulations, the agency and the Justice Department alleged

8

that we had no standing because title IX did not apply to

9

us, the regulations didn't apply to us, because they

10

didn't apply, as their brief put it, to a private athletic

association.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I guess I'd like to start essentially where Mr.
Roberts ended which is an examination of what is at a
minimum the appropriate course for this Court to follow
with respect to the unusual posture of this case.
This case, as you know, was brought by a pro se
litigant to file the complaint.

The complaint was

immediately dismissed on the grounds that the NCAA is in
some sense not subject to title IX or at least not on the
basis of the allegations in that complaint.
And she amended her complaint, and in the
amended complaint, she alleges quite plainly at paragraph
65, which since the amended complaint was only added to

the record afterwards, it's unfortunately not in the joint

2

appendix, but it has been lodged, the NCAA is a recipient

3

of Federal funds because it is an entity which receives

4

Federal financial assistance through another recipient and

5

operates an educational program or activity which receives

6

or benefits from such assistance.

7

And it seems quite plain to me that if you give

8

any kind of a liberal interpretation to the pleadings of a

9

pro se litigant in the context of that case, that that

10

allegation has raised a whole slew of theories as to why

11

the NCAA ought to be regarded at a minimum as a recipient,

12

either direct or indirect.

13

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Was the pro se litigant a lawyer?

me that we look at the -- at the National Youth Sports

22

suggestion that somehow there is anything that this Court

23

should do other than allow that matter to go back to the

remembering that there are two Federal district courts

that not only have upheld this theory at the complaint

stage, but have held that if you get into the evidence and

you find out the nature of the relationship between the

think that there is an ultimate question of fact that must

QUESTION:

You can make as many claims as you'd

like, but when there's a motion to dismiss, it seems to me

you have to come up with factual allegations that will

QUESTION:

The affidavit was filed by the

defendant.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor.

So -- but the

8

basic point here is -- remains, at least in my judgment at

9

this stage as the case comes to this Court, the proper

10

course at a minimum to follow is to send it back to allow

11

the proceedings to go on with respect to the relationship

12

between the NCAA and the National Youth Sports Program.

13

Now I'd like to address what I think is the more

14

central legal issue in this case, at least in my judgment.

15

And you will notice that in Mr. Roberts' analysis of this

16

case, he spends very little time focusing on the statutory

17

language, jumping ahead instead to -- to decisions of this

18

Court.

19

because I don't believe, frankly, that you need to be an

20

actual Federal fund recipient under section 901(a) in an

21

action brought as a private right of action against a

22

defendant who is clearly a wrongdoer in the context of the

23

allegations of this complaint.

I'd like to go back to the statutory language

24

This Court held in Gwinnett that -- the rule has

25

been around for at least a hundred years, and perhaps even

2

can be held liable on damages for the wrongs that they do.

3

And they should be -- and they should realize that they're

4

put on notice, that when they engage in actions that

5

violate statutes, that the person who's been injured by

6

that, and particularly the person who was in the special

7

class of people to be protected, is allowed to come

8

forward and seek damages for that particular injury.

9

And it seems to me that the language of 901(a),

10

which says that no one shall be excluded from

11

participation in a federally funded activity on the basis

12

of sex, specifically, explicitly, and completely covers

But let me -- let me address the -- the legal

whether you address it what your answer is.

address it, but if it's a more complicated question than

that, maybe you should get the facts.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

No, I agree with that.

They're arguing the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Phillips pointed out, that -- that the operative provision

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- I think in this --in

11

this case in particular it does not because what section

12

901 says is that there shall be no discrimination in a

13

program receiving Federal assistance, not a program

14

operated by a recipient, but a program that receives

15

Federal financial assistance.

intercollegiate athletic programs of all -- of probably

the vast majority of the NCAA's member institutions

There's no doubt that the

The question -- and ordinarily, if you look at

1687, it refers to the operations of a -- of a program or

Ordinarily it's the recipient, but where the recipient has

The question then I think is who operates it.

QUESTION:

no total answer to the point the Chief Justice was making

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- our -- our position

13

here is solely where the -- where, in effect, the board of

14

trustees, which would otherwise have final decision making

authority for the recipient, turns that final decision

QUESTION:

would impose liability on the superior governing

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and under the title IX

regulations, that makes that clear.

right.

Intent is really not the right question.
The question is whether the program being

operated is of the type that the Federal grant program was

intended to fund.

8

the -- whether the program is the sort of thing that was

9

intended to be funded.

10
11

And -- and the question then is whether

As the Court said, the college

program in Grove City was what was intended to be funded.
There's no doubt here that intercollegiate

12

athletics are part of a college program.

13

would be whether the various Federal programs that might

14

or might not be involved in this case -- and again,

15

there's been no exploration on that -- extend funding to

16

the whole college, including its athletic department, and

17

then whether the payment of dues is essentially the

18

transmittal of that Federal financial assistance.

The question

But the question is not whether a particular

entity was intended to have that -- to receive that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

5

First, I'd like to agree with both of my

6

brothers that the Third Circuit decision was wrong.

It

7

was wrong because title IX, as Spending Clause

8

legislation, is limited to recipients, and the effort to

9

rely on the dues or some surrogate relationship severs

10

title IX from its rooting in the Spending Clause and the

11

limitation to recipients.

12

The argument that was raised that the statutory

13

language doesn't carry any such limitation was the precise

14

argument that was raised last term in Gebser, and it was

15

rejected in Gebser.

16

discrimination under a program, the student in Gebser

17

certainly was, but that was not enough because title IX is

18

limited to recipients.

19

a recipient know about what was going on and what did the

20

recipient do or not do.

21

If it's enough to be subject to

And so, the question is what does

Now, so far as the new alternative arguments are

22

made, it is important to recognize that -- that in our

view they have not been properly preserved.

your complaint is amended -QUESTION:

2

But, Mr. Roberts, given the pro se

3

litigant, given the large discretion that the district

4

judge has on complaint amendments, should we be the one to

5

decide whether the amendment of the complaint is too late

6

and given cases like Conley against Gibson where this

7

Court has said -- instructed lower courts, be generous to

8

pro se litigants as far as amendment is concerned?
MR. ROBERTS:

9

But they have to allege facts.

10

The way it works is you allege facts and then you test

11

those against the legal standard --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know.

If you look at

13

the forms at the end of the Federal rules, is negligently

15

those forms are very skimpy.

16

Is money having received a fact?

opportunity.

Well, and she was afforded that

The district court basically said what is it

that you're talking about when you say, and if the answer
is dues, which is what the answer that was given, then
that's not enough and the complaint should be dismissed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, may I ask you what your

view is on the question whether we should decide the
delegation of a control over a program issue?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think the reason the Third

Circuit is wrong is because the NCAA is not a recipient.
That is an argument that would rely on extending title IX
to non-recipients.
QUESTION:

My -- my -- the question is whether

you think we ought to decide this other theory, you
know -MR. ROBERTS:

I think the Court should decide

the question whether having so-called effective control or
ceded authority is enough to subject you to coverage under
title IX when you're not a recipient.
QUESTION:

How do we get that in the question?

The question says because it receives payments from
entities that do so.

It has nothing to do with receiving

Control or not control or delegation would be

identical whether they happen to charge dues or whether
they don't charge dues.
