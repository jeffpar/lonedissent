CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument

now in Number 97-1396, Vicky Lopez v. Monterey County.

5

Mr. Avila.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOAQUIN G. AVILA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. AVILA:

8
9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question before you is whether a voting

11

change is required to be precleared prior to its

12

implementation within a section 5-covered jurisdiction.

13

Section 5, plain language,

its purpose,

14

administrative interpretation, and congressional

15

ratification, answer that question in the affirmative.

16

The State of California's statutory construction

17

argument would undermine the broad purpose of section 5 as

18

articulated by this Court.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but if it's a fair reading of

20

the statute it has weight in its own right, doesn't it,

21

even if it might be contrary to some earlier decisions of

22

this Court.

23

MR. AVILA:

Yes,

it would.

If there's any

24

ambiguity in the plain language of the statute then you

25

would look at, not only at prior precedent, but also you

1

would look at the structure, the overall structure of the

2

act, that is, the interrelationship between sections 4 and

3

5, and also you would look at the Attorney General's

4

longstanding interpretation of the act, and the

5

legislative history, which confirms Congress' awareness

6

and ratification of that interpretation.

7

And when you look at the focus of section 5, it

8

is on the covered jurisdiction and whether its voting

9

practices have changed, irrespective of the source of the

10

voting change, but the State's construction would immunize

11

a covered voting change so long as a State enacted a

12

superseding statute, even if that statute was never

13

subjected to preclearance.

14

This construction would create what has been

15

described as a loophole the size of a mountain.

16

examples of such loopholes are:

17
18

1.

Counties could evade section 5 review by

securing courtesy legislation at the State level.

19

2.

20

would be circumvented.

21

Two

Section 5 review of redistricting plans

On the other hand, a harmonious interpretation

22

of the statute is achieved by construing section 5

23

consistently with section 4.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the courtesy legislation point,

I mean, I guess you have to acknowledge that a covered

1

county can do some nasty things which it hasn't tried to

2

do before by getting the State to acknowledge State-wide

3

legislation.

No?

MR. AVILA:

4

That's correct.

is that the State's argument,

The problem,

5

however,

6

Court, would result in major loopholes in the section 5

7

preclearance provision and,

8

it would immunize the county's voting changes from section

9

5 review.
QUESTION:

10

in this particular instance,

If you appeal the plain language,

what do you do when the State adopts a general provision

of legislation?

14

legislation?

17

Does each county within the State that

My understanding is that it's simply the

MR. AVILA:

If -- the focus is on the voting

18

changes that occur within the covered jurisdiction.

19

the State enacts a statute that affects voting changes

20

within our covered jurisdiction, either the State or the

21

county can submit either the -- the legislation for

22

section 5 preclearance.

If

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't --

24

QUESTION:

But if you're appealing to the plain

25

language, does the plain language suggest that either the

1

State or the county can do it?

2

MR. AVILA:

The plain language of section 5

3

would suggest that either a covered State or a political

4

subdivision, but, however, the responsibility, the primary

5

responsibility would be on Monterey County to make sure

6

that it submits any voting change, irrespective of its

7

source, when it effectuates a voting change in that

8

covered county.

9

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand you.

10

plain language is it that you're relying on?

11

seek to administer?
MR. AVILA:

12

What

Is it the

Yes, it is, and the seeks to

13

administer refers, in fact, to the act of administering,

14

not, as the State argues, to an administrative act.

15
16

Again, the focus is on the covered jurisdiction
and whether its voting practices have changed.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the State has not -- pardon

18

me.

19

20

the county seek to administer such a provision?

21

asking.

22

Suppose the county has no discretion.

I might seek your advice.

The State isn't really -- or the, pardon me.

23

The county really isn't asking to do anything.

told by the State to do it.

25

Let's assume the State has no different options.

It's being

Let's assume no discretion.

QUESTION:

As this Court in

It is implementing a voting change.
But it's not seeking to in the sense

of wanting to, of asking to.

It's simply obeying a

command from the State.
MR. AVILA:

Well, even if it obeys a command

12

from the State, when it effectuates voting change within

13

that covered jurisdiction it has to be submitted for

14

section 5 preclearance, otherwise you're going to create

15

huge exemptions, especially in States that have -- that

16

include covered section 5 counties, like North Carolina.

17

QUESTION:

You say a huge exemption, but it's

18

perfectly arguable from the language that that's what

19

Congress intended.

20

MR. AVILA:

It is a re - - it is one

21

interpretation.

However, the Attorney General, which is

22

charged with the central enforcement of this section 5,

23

could also have another reasonable interpretation, and

24

that reasonable interpretation in the past has been

25

deferred to by this Court, especially in matters -7

especially in terms of interpreting its regulations as

2

they apply to matters affecting voting, and in Presley

3

that was the case.

4

In Presley, section 5's broad scope as it

5

relates to election matters was given a very broad scope,

6

and that - - and the Attorney General in this case has been

7

interpreted - -

9

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't there an argument on

the other side, that here we deal with national and State

10

relations, and that since this does impinge on them,

11

should probably not get a terribly sweeping

12

interpretation.

Here Congress has stepped into the State -- the
State local business.

15

MR. AVILA:

Yes, but that balance, that balance

16

between -- that delicate balance that was struck by

17

Congress back in 1965 between a State's sovereignty and

18

the Federal interest in eliminating the blight of voting

19

discrimination, that was struck in 1965, and it's been

20

reratified, or ratified three times.

21

QUESTION:

Precisely, so let's look at the

22

language and not some cry for a very broad interpretation

23

of it.

interpretation.

It is not a cry for a very broad

case is just merely maintain what's been going on since

2

1965 .
And that is, when you have the Attorney General

3
4

reviewing redistricting plans for 1970,

1980, and 1990

5

from North Carolina, New York, and California, which are

6

States that contain covered counties, when you look at

7

that, and you look at the Congressional Record that's

8

cited in our briefs, you find that in fact in the 1982

9

reenactment of the Voting Rights Act you find explicit

10

references in the Senate report that say, while -- quote,

11

while North Carolina as a State is not subject to section

12

5,

13

counties which are covered, and therefore it should have

14

been precleared.

15

the legislation in question affected North Carolina

And when you look at another page reference, at

16

page 14 in that Senate report,

17

letters of objection, which they found to be compelling

18

evidence for reenacting section 5, and one of those

19

letters of objection on page 11 of that Senate report is

20

the 1981 redistricting plan for North Carolina.

it explicitly refers to

So we have this history of administrative

interpretation and this history of congressional

ratification of that interpretation, and so when we - - and

1

section -- sections 5 and section 4, we find even more

2

compelling reasons for maintaining the status quo.
In Katzenbach, this Court stressed the

3
4

interrelationships between sections 4 and 5, and stated

5

that section 5 was designed to march in lockstep with

6

section 4.

7

In Katzenbach and Gaston County,

this Court

8

approved section 4's statutory framework which suspended

9

State literacy laws in section 5-covered counties, even

10

though the State itself was not a designated jurisdiction.
In other words, all literacy tests that were

11

12

suspended in the covered counties were products of State

13

law.

14

QUESTION:

Well, one of your arguments is the --

15

what -- the risk of what you refer to as the courtesy

16

legislation,

17

to avoid section 5,

18

will simply mean that the counties will get the

19

legislature to enact what they want.

20

that in fact if State law itself is a means
the usual State capitol log-rolling

Is it an answer to that to say that a line

21

should be drawn between legislation which affects only a

22

covered county and general legislation which in fact

23

affects every county in the State, which I understand is

24

the case here?

25

Is the risk sufficiently reduced in the case of

1

bona fide State-wide legislation so that we should

2

dismiss -- in a case like this we should dismiss the

3

concerns about courtesy legislation?

4

MR. AVILA:

Yes, because in fact the State of

5

California has a choice here in enacting State

6

legislation.

7

find that California in fact directed its legislative

8

effort towards one county.

9

mentions Monterey County.

10

When we look at the 1979 State statute we

QUESTION:

The statute specifically

Well, there's two things there.

11

Justice Souter can certainly protect his own question.

12

The premise of his question was that there was State

13

legislation which applied to more counties than Monterey,

14

and he said, would that be a difference.

15

And then you say, well, this 1979 statute

16

applied only to Monterey.

17

answer his question as a principle of law.

18

MR. AVILA:

19

QUESTION:

That doesn't really quite

Yes.
Why don't you answer the question,

20

first as to whether or not his suggestion about the

21

principle is accurate,

22

principle applies here.

23

MR. AVILA:

then you can say whether or not the

The principle of law is that when

you have a State-wide statute that has -- that affects

voting changes throughout the State, and four of those

counties in California are subject to section 5,

State statutes would have to be submitted for section 5

preclearance.

4

QUESTION:

MR. AVILA:

6

QUESTION:

those

Well, but that's the issue.
Yes.
I mean,

that's the issue, and one of

7

your reasons for saying that they must be is that unless

8

the general legislation is so submitted with respect to
those counties,

legislation at the State level will simply

10

be used as a cover for what in fact is local

11

discriminatory efforts.

12

MR. AVILA:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.
My suggestion was that perhaps if you

14

have a genuine, bona fide legislative act intended to

15

cover the whole State that really does cover the whole

16

State,

17

why would you have that concern in the case of State-wide

18

legislation?

1

that you don't have that concern, and why isn't --

MR. AVILA:

We would have that concern,

if I

20

understand the -- your question, because it might still

21

have mischief in other counties.

For example,

You're saying that it might lack

intent to discriminate but have the effect.

question for another proceeding, because here we are still

2

in the enforcement stage of section 5, and that issue

3

would be best addressed when you're reviewing the

substantive determination of whether a State-wide statute

has a discriminatory purpose, or has a discriminatory

QUESTION:

Could I ask you to identify what

This has had a complicated

What precisely are you now asking?
Are you trying to get preclearance of the

California State law in 1979 consolidating municipal

courts into a single district, or the county ordinance

that same year, or both?

15

MR. AVILA:

It isn't clear to me.

We are trying to - - both.

16

answer is both.

We are trying to basically enforce this

Well, yes, fine, but I'm trying to

pin it down. You want preclearance, in effect, of the 1979

county consolidation ordinance.

MR. AVILA:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

effect.

1

And even if you get some kind of

preclearance and review in the meantime, State law has

changed again, and has totally eliminated judicial

MR. AVILA:

QUESTION:

Well -There's a constitutional amendment

now that eliminated Justice of the Peace courts, and

there's a State law increasing municipal judges from seven

14

Yes,

So at the bottom line, what are you

trying to get?

17

MR. AVILA:

The bottom line is that the 1983

18

preclearance merely involved the preclearance that this

19

Court found from -- going from three districts, three

20

judicial districts to one county-wide district and in

21

fact,

22

and the 1983 State statute cannot be read to have

precleared those nine districts into three districts,

Under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act a

covered jurisdiction like Monterey County must obtain

preclearance of any voting change that it enacts or that

it seeks to administer.

voting changes that the county seeks to administer.

In every election for county judges, Monterey

voters are registered, by which candidates are placed on

the ballot, and by which the winners are chosen in the

election.

QUESTION:

Isn't that all pursuant to State law?

MR. WOLFSON:

14

does have to follow State law in some respects, but the

Even the entire compliance with the

law of another sovereign, the State, you know, put up

21

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes, it is, and in fact I point to

22

two examples.

First, I mean, the court looked at a very

23

similar matter in Perkins v. Matthews, where the State of

24

Mississippi before the Voting Rights Act was enacted had

elections, and when eventually the city got around to

2

complying with that State law the court said, the change

3

had to be precleared even though the formal enactment by

4

the higher sovereign did not have to be precleared.

5

Another example, actually that's quite relevant

6

here, is, of course, the literacy tests that occasioned

7

the passing of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

8

9

It's quite clear in this case that those tests
were mandated by California State law, and they were

10

implemented throughout the State of California at the

11

county level.

QUESTION:

You're talking about literacy tests

in California?
MR. WOLFSON:

Literacy tests were required by

California State law.

They were struck down by the

section 5 was long enacted.

My point is that Congress

21

understood that even though there might be a requirement

county follow some procedures, that the county might

Carolina, a very important example that was ostensibly

2

discussed when the Voting Rights Act was initially

enacted, it was clear to Congress that there could be

situations where a State -- there might be nothing wrong

Now, if I may address Justice Kennedy's question

I think that's a -- seek to administer is purely

temporal, and it should be contrasted with enacts.

then it has to obtain preclearance.

that the combination of the preclearance of the State's

1983 statute and of the county's final ordinance merging

the last remaining justice courts into the municipal

MR. STONE:

Well, in this Court's prior Lopez

constitutional framework justice courts are for

jurisdiction of less than 40,000, and municipal courts are

12

for more than 40,000, and the requirement that a municipal

Mr. Stone,

this is not in the record,

6

but someone told me recently that in Los Angeles County

7

the superior court judges and the municipal courts have

8

been combined so that there'll simply be one kind of judge

9

there.

10

Do you know anything about that, and is it State­

wide, or would that just be Los Angeles County?
MR. STONE:

11

It's rather a combination.

In June

12

of this year the State constitution was amended to permit

13

what's called unification of municipal and superior

14

courts.

15

If the vote taken in a given county shows a

16

majority of both the sitting municipal court judges and

17

the sitting superior court judges in favor of that

18

unification, at that point the municipal court in that

county would be abolished, and apparently that's what

occurred in Los Angeles County.

So this is just a section 5 case.

MR. STONE:

QUESTION:

Strictly section 5.
Well, is part -- I guess the reason I

ask this is this.

6

would, in fact, have great discretion to fashion a remedy

7

if it found a section 2 violation?

8

9

Is part of your argument, or is it

It could, for example, say the only way to
eliminate the discriminatory effect that I find is to, in

10

effect, to require as a remedial scheme four districts,

11

each electing one judge, as opposed to one district from

12

which four are elected.

13

However, is it implicit in your argument that

14

the judge -- that the district court does not have that

15

degree of flexibility under section 5, that under section

16

5 all it can say is, you are supposed to preclear, you

17

haven't, therefore preclear, and that its remedial

QUESTION:

So that, I take it, is the reason

4

that you're saying that there isn't anything -- I think

5

you're saying that the court cannot practically do -- it

6

cannot practically order the kind of remedy that the

7

petitioners would like.
MR. STONE:

8

9

That's correct.

If the petitioners

were -- if the county were required to go to Washington,

10

D.C. and preclear, or attempt to preclear its ordinances,

11

it would be an utterly futile act at this point because

12

the county has no remaining authority to implement those

13

ordinances.

14

QUESTION:

Why isn't it -- look, I'm missing

15

something, because it just -- I thought that there's a

statute, and what the statute that I have in front of me

says is, whenever a political subdivision of a State --

MR. STONE:

Yes.

right?

in a section 5 coverage case, one of the issues that is

2

before the district court is whether the voting change,

3

the alleged voting change that is challenged, is in fact

4

subject to preclearance in the first place.
QUESTION:

5

Now, but I just read you the statute,

6

I take it, that when you read it on its face it seems to

7

be that it is subject to preclearance.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, that's the very issue here, is

it not?

10

MR. STONE:

Precisely.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

I mean, that's what this case is

13

about, to say yes or no to that, and if we say yes, then

14

the district court, Federal district court in California

15

has to simply say yes, it's covered, period.

16

MR. STONE:

17

QUESTION:

Correct.
Then it will be up to the county, if

18

it wants to implement election of judges at all, to seek

19

preclearance, or the State may, according to the Attorney

20

General, the Solicitor General, the State may do it if it

21

wants.

So the question is very much focused

does the State legislature do that?
MR. STONE:

It could be either way, and I'm not

sure precisely in the case of Los Angeles.
QUESTION:

The statute --

Are there any counties in the State

6

of California with multiple judicial districts where the

7

counties set the district lines?
MR. STONE:

8
9

Yes.

Yes.

There is statutory

discretion given to the counties unless the State acts

10

otherwise, and what's happened here is the State has taken

11

over.

12

QUESTION:

So then there would be no, really

13

violation of overall State policy for Monterey to do this

by compulsion of a Federal court in the D.C. Circuit --

MR. STONE:

QUESTION:

To do - -- or in compliance with the plan.
To divide into subdivisions?
In other words,

some counties in

California do set their own electoral district lines, and

20

therefore it doesn't necessarily contravene State policy

21

to do so in Monterey.

22

MR. STONE:

Well, I submit that it does, not

23

only because in 1972 the State Judicial Council and the

24

Chief Justice indicated that they thought that was the

25

better way for Monterey County to operate, but also

1

because much more recently the State has dictated that

2

there be just one municipal court in Monterey County.
So the State policy with respect to this part of

3
4

its overall judicial system has spoken, and has

5

dictated -- all parties are agreed here that the county no

6

longer has any discretion to have a municipal court

7

anything short of county-wide.
So my point is that, since we have this

8

9

ambiguity, then under the cases relating to importance of

10

Federalism, the Gregory v. Ashcroft, the New York v.

11

United States, Will v. Michigan, they say that if there's

12

only an ambiguity, if the most that the plaintiffs can

13

show is an ambiguity, then that falls far short of the

14

requisite clear statement --

15

QUESTION:

16

Can I go back to Justice Kennedy's

question for just a moment?

17

The State policy we're talking about of having

18

just one judicial district in the county is a county-

19

specific State policy, not a general State policy, isn't

20

it?

5

QUESTION:

that's always

It doesn't seem to me so unusual to

6

say that when a State has a county-specific policy

7

relating to a covered county, that there may be special

8

reason for the State law to bow to the Federal law that

9

applies only to that county.

10

MR. STONE:

The problem the State has with that

11

is that it takes the presumption which attaches with

12

application of section 5 - - if you're a covered

13

jurisdiction, you're presumed to have had a history of

14

wrongdoing, and you're suspected in the future of making

15

voting changes designed to undermine the voting rights of

16

minority voters.

Yes, but -- that's right, and the

State can do that just as readily as the county can.

MR. STONE:

QUESTION:

But the point is -In fact, more readily, because it's

not trying to be careful not to undermine it, and that

there'd be a lot of places in the south where they vote in

1

As long as the covered jurisdiction is

2

implementing a change, section 5 applies, and that common

3

sense understanding of the term was reflected in the

4

Court's earlier opinion in this case when, writing for a

5

unanimous Court, Justice O'Connor stated that a section 5-

6

covered jurisdiction must obtain preclearance before

7

"implementing" a voting change.

8
9

Those were the words used by this Court to
describe the operative effect of section 5, and when we

10

look at the administrative practices of the Attorney

11

General in Sheffield, this Court held that the Attorney

12

General's interpretation of section 5 is, quote,

13

persuasive evidence of original understanding.

14

So what we're trying to do in this case is

15

merely maintain what's been going on for the past three

16

decennial redistrictings, and when we look at what -- in

17

fact, what the State of California and the county

18

administers at the local level, we know that the county

19

administers the election machinery and the personnel that

20

actually administer the State elections, and in our brief

21

we cite to numerous State statutes in which the State

22

mandates that a particular election occur, and that the

23

county is directed to administer that election.

If the 1983 statute was precleared,

district, and why shouldn't that end this case?
MR. AVILA:

2

It does not end the case because

3

when you're talking about reviewing a voting change you're

4

talking about what happened before and what happened

5

after.

6

The 1983 State statute only referred to the

7

conversion from three judicial districts to a single

8

county-wide district.

9

November 1968 nine judicial district plan, and we do not

It did not start off with the

10

have the conversion before the Department of Justice or

11

the D.C. court between nine districts --

12

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

If the 1983

13

statute provided for a single judicial district, and this

14

has been precleared, getting back to Justice O'Connor's

15

question, what's left?

16

MR. AVILA:

What's left is the judicial --

17

what's left is the preclearance of nine districts which

18

existed on November 1, 1968, to three districts which

19

existed in 1983.

20

The 1983 State statute only converted three

21

judicial districts into a single county-wide.

Whenever

22

you examine voting change, it's examining from what, from

23

what is it being changed from, to what is it being changed

24

to, and that's precisely the point that we're making in

25

this argument.
