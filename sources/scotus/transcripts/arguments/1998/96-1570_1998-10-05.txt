CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. YOUNG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. YOUNG:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In explaining why the Second Circuit was wrong,

11

I'd like to focus on two legal principles.

The first is

12

that an antitrust case brought by a disappointed supplier

13

must contain adequate allegations of harm to competition

14

and not just harm to the competitor, and the second is

15

that that harm-to-competition requirement is not met

16

simply by an allegation that the supplier was terminated

17

for a bad reason, even if that reason is in violation of

18

laws other than the antitrust laws.

19

The lower courts have repeatedly used these

20

principles to deal efficiently and appropriately with

21

meritless but tempting treble damage antitrust suits

22

brought by suppliers and distributors in the lower courts

23

and, in doing so, they have been consistent with the

24

principles of GTE Sylvania and Sharp, because the very

25

cost of this litigation alone -- these cases go on for

1

years.

2

tremendous chill on the right to, a purchaser's right to

3

change suppliers freely, which is the essence of the

4

competitive process.

5

The expenses are tremendous.

These costs are a

The Second Circuit made a substantive error.

6

extended group boycott law to cover a vertical nonprice

7

agreement despite the clear requirement that a group

8

boycott requires a horizontal agreement.

9

It

Now, the second circuit made this error

10

apparently because it confused an alleged regulatory fraud

11

in the telephone services market, the aim of which was to

12

raise local telephone rates, for a competitive problem,

13

but this case has nothing to do with rivalry among

14

providers of local telephone service.

15

acknowledges that.

16

Discon in its brief

Now, apparently, because of this confusion the

17

Second Circuit did not even examine whether there were

18

concrete allegations of market-wide harm to competition in

19

the removal services market, which is the only relevant

20

market here.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

So if costs were passed on to the

consumer, that's just irrelevant?
MR. YOUNG:

It's very relevant for regulatory

24

purposes, but the question in a rule of reason analysis in

25

the removal services market is whether or not a price now

put in the conditions of competition in that market were

2

changed, where -QUESTION:

3

It seems to me if you have a

4

monopolist that's the buyer and the agreement is to

5

eliminate all but one supplier, and if you assume that

6

those costs are going to be passed on to the consumer, I

7

don't know why that isn't part of the competitive

8

analysis, at least under the rule of reason.
MR. YOUNG:

9

The -- I think the important portion

10

that is relevant under the rule of reason, as I say, it's

11

not whether local telephone rates were raised.

12

regulatory commissions to examine those issues.

13

question is, what were the terms of rivalry in the removal

14

services market, and that's really where the Second

15

Circuit I think missed the boat.

whether or not there was harm to competition in that

17

market.

On that question --

QUESTION:

Suppose we could show the costs were

21

passed on to the consumers, and that that was the

22

necessary effect of this, and it's a rule of reason

admit the testimony if the costs were passed on to the

25

consumers, unnecessarily?

In a rule of reason case, the court would not

MR. YOUNG:

1

In a rule of reason case, Justice

2

Kennedy, I think that fact, the fact that costs were

3

passed on, is irrelevant to the rule of reason antitrust

4

analysis.

5

QUESTION:

But may I just interrupt with, what

6

about the costs of removal services?

7

conspiracy, which may or may not have existed, result in

8

higher costs of removal services?

9

11

MR. YOUNG:

What if the alleged

That's the core of the case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And don't they allege that they did,

12

that Technologies bid $998,000, and the plaintiff was

13

bidding about half that amount any they mark it up to

14

amounts still less than --

15

MR. YOUNG:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19

Just -Haven't they alleged that the costs

of removal services were artificially enhanced?
MR. YOUNG:

No, I don't believe they have, and

I'd like to explain why.

20

What happened --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask just preliminarily before

22

you make that explanation, who was in the removal

23

business, other than ATT Technology and Discon?

24
25

One picture that I have is an agreement that
would leave only one supplier standing, and in that case,

1

if there were only the two in the business, it would be

2

quite a different situation than if it were just a single

3

supplier eliminated and many still standing, so what was

4

it?

5

MR. YOUNG:

The complaint alleges at least four

6

people, four companies in the business.

7

there was AT&T, there was a company called LISN, which I

8

believe is pronounced LISN, and there was an individual

9

named McGee.

10

There was Discon,

All are alleged in the complaint as being in

the business.

11

Actually, the New York Public Service

12

Commission, which conducted a detailed inquiry into this,

13

in the public record of that proceeding is the fact that

14

there were, in fact, a very large number of people

15

competing in this business.

16

To the question about price and output, though,

17

price and output, that is, in the removal services market,

18

that is the critical factor, but the allegation here is

19

that New York Telephone voluntarily paid more than the

20

market price.

21

It's the same sort of situation as if the

22

procurement officer at NYNEX had decided to give the money

23

to his -- to give the business to his brother-in-law and

24

pay his brother-in-law an extra 20 percent.

25

change the market price.

That doesn't

QUESTION:

1

Oh, but why doesn't it, if that's a

2

main purchaser in the market, and if the people who made

3

the agreement -- the whole thing is kind of strange, but

4

anyway, if the people who made the agreement had for its

5

purpose higher prices for removal services, why does it

6

matter that they were willing to pay the higher prices?

7

MR. YOUNG:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I think -Because those prices then, as Justice

Kennedy pointed out, are passed on to the ultimate
consumer of telephone services.
MR. YOUNG:

11

I think what matters about it is

12

that if there is no change in the terms of rivalry in the

13

removal services market, and I'd like to get to that in a

14

minute, why I think that's true, then the fact that a

15

buyer voluntarily pays more doesn't change the market

16

price, doesn't change the market output.

17

unchanged.

18

That is

The question is, if New York Telephone decided

19

at one point that it didn't want to be a part of this

20

alleged scheme any more, could it go into the market and

21

get the competitive price for removal services, and it

22

could, for I think a very fundamental reason.

23

in Mitsushita, in talking about what market power means

24

and the elements of market power, has indicated that

25

barriers to entry are critical, that you can't maintain

This Court

1

supracompetitive prices without market power without

2

barriers to entry.
QUESTION:

3

But isn't there going to be, even as

4

you describe it, a tendency to inflate price even in the

5

event that NYNEX tomorrow morning, or tomorrow morning

6

after the complaint was filed, decided that it didn't want

7

to pay that much, because it had already demonstrated that

8

in fact it would pay an inflated price, the competitors --

9

I will assume for the sake of argument there were three --

10

knew that it would pay the inflated price, and therefore I

11

assume there would be a tendency on their part to say,

12

let's hold them to their inflated price, or something like

13

it.

14

So the very fact that NYNEX may change its mind

15

tomorrow morning doesn't necessarily suggest that it will

16

return to the competitive market that it had before it

17

showed its willingness to pay the inflated price.

18

MR. YOUNG:

I think the reason that it would

19

return to the competitive price is the fact in this

20

industry, where there are no barriers to entry, the

21

complaint alleges not just that these people were in the

22

market, but that this business can and was performed by

23

telephone companies for themselves.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, you may -- and I realize that,

so in fact there's a fifth player here -9

1

MR. YOUNG:

2

QUESTION:

Right.
-- I know, but isn't the point at

3

this stage that that is a matter for litigation under a

4

rule of reason analysis?
In other words, the only point that I think I'm

5
6

making is that it does not seem to be implausible as a

7

matter of law, on the allegations of the complaint, that

8

if NYNEX changed its mind tomorrow morning, the price

9

would necessarily return to the pre-inflation competitive

10

price.

It seems to me a matter for -- at least for

11

litigation, isn't that so?
MR. YOUNG:

12

No, I don't agree, and the reason I

13

don't agree is the point I'm coming back to with barriers

14

to entry.

15

appendix at page 15 to 17, indicates how easy and quick it

16

was for somebody to get into this business, which is

17

really just the first cousin of the salvage business.

18

The original complaint, and this is the joint

Discon got into business in June of 1984.

19

Within 30 days it had $500,000 worth of business.

20

plans to ramp up its operation here fairly dramatically.

21

It had

So I think the important point is that if there

22

are no barriers to entry, then there is absolutely no

23

reason to suspect, and a district court faced with this

24

kind of complaint can reasonably conclude that there is no

25

adequate allegation here of harm to competition.

There is

only an allegation that a purchaser voluntarily agreed to

So they paid some money, which was cheap, and

There's no reason to think that's any lower, or

They paid a competitive price.

It just happened

16

they paid about the same amount of money, and they also

17

got a little kick in there.

MR. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

So there's no doubt about that, is

It's a different product they were

there?

selling.

They were making an extraordinary offer.

MR. YOUNG:

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

Yes, right, a little higher --

2

QUESTION:

They're selling removal services plus

3

a kickback, so the price for the removal service is quite

low.

5

MR. YOUNG:

6

QUESTION:

7

It might have been the best price in

the market, actually.
QUESTION:

9

You could certainly analyze it --

So there's no doubt about that, but

there's also no doubt, I take it, that the consumer paid

more.

12

monopoly power?

13

I mean, they went and chiseled, according to the

Of course.

So I mean I don't see there's any -- your --

it's a monopoly, all right, so --

MR. YOUNG:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. YOUNG:

That's how it

But it was -Yes.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Go ahead.
I agree that the allegation is that

22

they were exercising monopoly power in the telephone

23

services market, but the important point is, that's not

24

the relevant market for the analysis here.

25

market is the removal services market.

The relevant

There's understandably some confusion because

1

2

the -- of course, the theory of the harm in this case has

3

been very much a moving target throughout the history of

4

this litigation, but stripped to its essentials you can

5

put the monopoly, the allegation about telephone services

6

aside, because that's not the relevant market for this

7

case.

8

9

What is critical is the removal services market,
where there were no barriers to entry, where entry was

10

easy, and so there was no reason to think that the terms

11

of competition were altered at all.

12

QUESTION:

What about the purchase of removal

13

services, as opposed to the sale of removal services?

14

Does -- was there monopoly power there?

15

MR. YOUNG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. YOUNG:

In the purchase of removal services?
Right.
Well, certainly I think you have to

18

say the complaint fairly alleges that there were two

19

principal buyers of removal services, but the allegations

20

of the complaint are focused on the provider's side of the

21

equation and, of course, here, since this is -- we're

22

considering a motion to dismiss, we have to take the

23

allegations in the complaint.

24

QUESTION:

25

It's alleging a conspiracy between

the provider and the purchaser, right, and -13

1

MR. YOUNG:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.
When such a conspiracy is alleged,

3

wouldn't the monopoly power on the part of the purchaser

4

be relevant?

5

MR. YOUNG:

Only if there were adequate

6

allegations that the terms of market-wide competition in

7

the removal services market had changed, and here -- here

I come back to what I tried to explain before.

concern.
QUESTION:

11

Actually, as I understand it

12

there's -- there were two purchasers, the exchange sub of

13

AT&T as well as the NYNEX sub, and the allegation is, they

14

agreed to create a monopoly in the purchase of removal

15

services.

16

MR. YOUNG:

That was one of the allegations

17

pressed below, that you could say that, if I understand

18

the question correctly, that there was a conspiracy

19

between two separate subsidiaries of NYNEX.

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, no, between the NYNEX MECo, or

whatever it is --

Right.
-- and the AT&T subsidiary that

consumed removal services in its exchange business, in

MR. YOUNG:

1

Yes.

Yes, there was an allegation

2

that there was a conspiracy between those two.

3

allegation in the trial court -- I think this is clear

4

from the complaint, the amended complaint, paragraphs 100

5

and 104.
I'm sorry.

6

The

Let me get directly to the point.

7

The point is that the allegation below was that there was

8

a conspiracy to make NYNEX the monopolist in that market.

9

Now, the reason that is faulty, the reason that doesn't

10

even meet the conspiracy test, is that NYNEX was not in

11

the removal services market and had no intent to be.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't the complaint fairly read as

13

indicated, they wanted AT&T Technologies to have all the

14

removal business?

15

MR. YOUNG:

I think the complaint is fairly

16

read, and now I refer to paragraphs 100 and 104 of the

17

amended complaint, where the allegation is that the power

18

over price was to be in NYNEX's hands, and also if you

19

look at the briefs they're filed in the court of appeals.

20

I think it's clear that what they were alleging

21

below -- it's not the theory that the Second Circuit went

22

off on, but their theory below was that it was NYNEX to be

23

the monopolist, and that's why there's a fundamental

24

problem in that theory, because NYNEX wasn't even in the

25

business.

think is clear, and that is, we have the final theory

before us.

19

before us, the allegations have the problem that I think

I've described, so this is a case that is very appropriate

That's not to say that there -- a plaintiff with

action.

action, or a fraud, or a tortious interference.

15

could be other legal remedies for someone in Discon's

17

to look at this problem through.

MR. YOUNG:

No, I don't believe so, because the

3

question presented did not use the words per se, it said,

4

group boycott.

5

The Second Circuit, when it used that phrase,

6

encompassed both -- included both alternatives, either a

7

rule of reason or a per se analysis, so I think the rule

8

of reason analysis is fairly included in the question

9

presented and, as I said before, I think this Court has

10

everything before it that it needs to resolve the case.

11

The principles here I think are relatively

12

straightforward.

respectfully suggest, for further --

There is no further need, I would

QUESTION:

May I ask this question, Mr. Young.

You place great emphasis on the fact there are no barriers

to entry --

MR. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- in the market and, assuming that's

19

correct, is it your position that even if the people in

20

the business do engage in a conspiracy to exclude somebody

21

entirely and drive them out of business for all sorts of

improper purposes, that could never be an antitrust

23

violation as long as there are no barriers to entry,

MR. YOUNG:

1

The -- Justice Stevens, I think the

2

right answer to that question is, as long as what we're

3

talking about is a vertical nonprice agreement, then the

4

appropriate analysis is the rule of reason analysis, and

5

it is -- as long as there genuinely are no barriers to

6

entry, it may well be that the allegation is that people

7

have acted for a bad reason in terminating the supplier,

8

but that's not --

9

QUESTION:

And the bad reason in this case is,

10

to exclude this company from the market permanently and

11

entirely no matter what it takes, that's perfectly all

12

right, because other people can always get back in and

13

replace them?

14

MR. YOUNG:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Because -That would never be an antitrust

violation.
MR. YOUNG:

Because the relevant question is,

18

what is the state of rivalry in the market, not whether a

19

particular supplier goes out of business.

20

QUESTION:

Just getting back to the relevant

market one more time, let's assume a universe in which,

Could I ask -- I frankly tend to

agree with you about what result you get when you apply

the rule of reason, but I'm not sure that -- I certainly

4

didn't understand when I voted to grant the petition that

5

we were talking about anything except a group boycott in

6

violation of section 1, and that's a term of art, and the

term of art means the kind of thing that is a per se

violation.

9

would you have to call it a group boycott in order to use

10

Have you ever heard of a group boycott that --

the rule of reason?
MR. YOUNG:

11

Well, I think this Court in

12

Northwest Stationers certainly suggested that there could

13

be group boycotts that are not analyzed under a per se

14

approach, but in terms of the question presented, plainly

15

the Second Circuit indicated meant group boycott to

subsume both per se and rule of reason.

The second reason, which I think is

-- important is --

MR. YOUNG:

9

The second reason is that if this Court sends

in dealing with these disappointed supplier cases.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE:

11

12

Very well, Mr. Young.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The courts have not had experience with the kind

13

14

of antitrust claim alleged in this case.

15

regulatory evasion scheme to harm consumers by recovering

16

inflated costs under a rate regulation system allowing

17

recovery of costs by the regulated utility, the kind of

18

system of rate regulation now rapidly being superseded by

19

competitive deregulation or by systems of rate regulation

20

such as price caps that are designed to provide greater

21

incentives for efficiency on the part of the regulated

22

utility.

23

It involves a

And the allegation is of a conspiracy not just,

24

for example, with an accountant to cook the books of the

25

regulated utility, but with a supplier in an unregulated,

1

what the antitrust lawyers call upstream market, the

2

market for these removal services, and the conspiracy

3

alleged is to monopolize that market and to exclude a

4

competitor of that supplier of removal services from that

5

unregulated market because competition in that market

6

would threaten the success of the scheme that allegedly

7

involves inflated payments to that supplier, followed by

8

secret rebates.
Now, we agree with petitioners that this is not

9
10

properly regarded as a per se -- an allegation of a per se

11

violation of the antitrust laws, for reasons explained in

12

our brief.

13

off track on that particular point by not recognizing that

14

it has to be a type of restraint that almost always tends

15

to restrict competition and reduce output, rather than

16

that on the facts of a particular case it might be shown

17

that the restraint has only anticompetitive effects.

18

Basically, we think the court of appeals got

So we agree that it's a case for rule of reason

19

analysis under section 1, but we do think that

20

petitioner's argument in, particularly in their brief, is

21

too facile in trying to make almost a virtue for purposes

22

of this case out of the regulatory evasion allegations.

23

They say that these allegations sufficiently

24

show the motive, a motive for the conduct that's alleged,

25

but that the effects on consumers in the utility's own

market for telephone services have to be ignored entirely

2

because the restraint alleged is in this upstream market

3

for removal services.

4

But the very authority they cite, correctly,

5

describing the rule of reason, this Court's decision in

6

Business Electronics v. Sharp Electronics, quoting its

7

decision in GTE Sylvania, says that under the rule of

8

reason -- and this is the quote from both cases -- the

9

factfinder weighs all the circumstances of a case in

10

deciding whether a restrictive practice should be

11

prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on

12

competition.

13

QUESTION:

Well, that's true when you have

14

identified a restraint on competition.

15

you know, is it worth the benefits on the other side.

16

what is the restraint on competition here?

You ask yourself,
But

17

The argument being made is that there is no

18

restraint on competition, period, that any time NYNEX

19

itself wanted to terminate this sweetheart deal it could,

20

and it would have in front of it a totally competitive

21

industry, because it takes nothing to get into it.

It's like demolition.

MR. WALLACE:

This argument may turn out to be

2

one that could be substantiated even in summary judgment

proceedings factually, but it seems to me to rest on

drawing too much out of some passing references in some of

the allegations of the complaint --

argument --

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

-- at this stage of the case.

-- Mr. Wallace.

I think he's making

10

the argument that the allegations in the complaint are

11

simply insufficient, that they have not, in fact, alleged

12

sufficiently barriers to entry.

13

response to that?

14

MR. WALLACE:

What's the Government's

Well, we certainly would file a

15

complaint, I hope, that would be clearer in its theories

16

of what the violation is.

17

The Second Circuit has read the complaint

18

generously, although we think that is not improper at the

19

motion to dismiss stage, the logic of the complaint,

20

putting the regulatory evasion scheme together with the

21

allegations of an attempt to achieve monopoly power

22

logically from the complaint to mask those regulatory

23

evasions, because the existence of competition by a

24

participant such as Discon would threaten to unmask it.

the threat to the scheme.

I want to know what facts there are

that, if we assume this motive, is a regulatory problem

barriers, only two firms --as tall as the Empire State

Now, assume all that, and tell me what are the

12

facts that would then make out a violation of either

13

section 1 or section 2.

14

MR. WALLACE:

Facts, not legal conclusions.
Well, the facts are that, as

15

alleged, that they discriminated against this participant

16

in the market in order to exclude him from the market even

17

when he was offering fully adequate competitive services

18

at a more favorable price, and that there were no

19

legitimate business reasons for the decision, but it was

20

designed to mask the regulatory violation.

QUESTION:

-- and they did it for this bad

QUESTION:

12

MR. WALLACE:

That --

And if so, what?
That they -- it's also alleged

13

that they conspired together to take steps to see to it

14

that the plaintiff here, the respondent, was excluded from

15

that market because of the threat that his competitive

16

offers would unmask the conspiracy, the regulatory evasion

17

conspiracy.

18

The point I want to make is that once the domain

19

of the antitrust laws has been entered because a restraint

20

has been alleged in the unregulated, upstream market, it

21

seems to us that the purpose and effect of the alleged

22

restraint should be looked at in total, just as the

purpose and effect occurs in the real world, and that

includes the effect on consumers in the utilities market.

this particular industry, I can ask for as low a price as

4

I want.

5

MR. BROWN:

Your Honor, my response to that

6

would be twofold.

First, the conduct in this particular

7

case concerned the manner in which a regulatory evasion

8

was effected.

That's where the anticompetitive harm came.

9

In the supplier market, the supplier market had

10

to be fixed and supercompetitive prices had to be enabled

11

by the elimination of competition in the supplier market,

12

which is unregulated, and what occurred here, Your Honor,

13

was a series of events which, when put into operation,

14

eliminated my client from that market, and I will go

15

further and say this.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, may I ask a rather

17

fundamental question that cuts across the whole case?

18

say, from that market.

MR. BROWN:

Yes.
Now, it seems to me there are at

least two different ways one might describe that market,

to the consumer.
MR. BROWN:

11

Yes.

Well, I think we did assume,

and I assumed in my brief in this Court we were dealing

13

with a monopsonist for the purchase of services in that

in awarding monopoly the State also supervises it, so

there are punishments that can be meted out by the

MR. BROWN:

We're not attacking -- we're not

Is there

I think, Your Honor, in response,

there are probably a couple.
First of all, there was just not a change of

suppliers for economic purposes at all.

evil motives, but I don't know if you're assuming the evil

motive that creates an antitrust injury.

9

QUESTION:

You've assumed

What evil motive -- now -- in other

10

words, there is a human being called a manager, and we're

11

looking into his mind, and I can see that that manager

12

might want to cheat the consumer, on your theory, I've got

13

that one, by raising the price above what he really paid

14

when he tells the regulator.

15
16
17

Now, is there some additional factual set of
things floating around in that person's brain?
MR. BROWN:

Right.

What?

Your Honor, there was a two-

18

step approach in this case which is specifically pled in

19

the amended complaint.

charged by the competitors and they would be marked up by

the manager, as you've called the manager.

went to your competitor and said, charge us a high price,

I've assumed that what happened was that the buyers

I'm assuming all that in your favor, and what

I'm looking for is some additional fact.

additional fact in this case that you would like to try to

prove, because I can deal with the legal issue as the

facts as I assume them.

Is there some

I decide one way or the other.

But what I'm looking for is, are there some

16

additional facts that you might prove which, I don't know

17

what they are.

18

That's why I'm asking the question.

MR. BROWN:

Right.

I think, Your Honor, the one

19

thing -- the things I would like to prove is, first of

20

all, to compete in this market I will not have to exercise

21

those efficiencies that would ordinarily be exercised for

22

me to compete in this market and to bid.

23

In other words, competition is being suppressed.

24

Price is being increased, output is being reduced, you

25

cannot enter this market unless you enter into the scheme.

Now, if the issue we're talking about, Your

1

2

Honor, is the regulatory, as Professor Areeda calls it,

3

the regulatory remedy as opposed to an antitrust remedy, I

4

only suggest this, that when the Public Service Commission

5

of the State of New York and the Federal regulators kept

6

pressing the utilities in this case they told them -- they

7

told them to take the procurement inside the regulated

8

businesses, and I say that because the regulators were
acknowledging that they could not regulate the supplier

10

market, that that's within the realm of antitrust.
If we're talking about the remedy for my client

11
12

as a competitor, the public service commission, Your

13

Honor, and the FCC cannot give my client, Discon,

all.

and I think they did adjust the rate basis, and they fined

2

them, and so did the Federal Communications Commission,

3

but that again doesn't address the antitrust issues and,

4

in fact, in this industry the FCC has acknowledged that

5

this industry in terms of antitrust, from the times of the

6

AT&T breakup case forward.

7

And there are a number of circuit court of

8

appeals cases on this acknowledging that the existence of

9

regulation in and of itself is not an excuse for not

10

applying the antitrust laws, because the regulation does

11

not address antitrust violations.

Could you explain one allegation?

agencies.

I don't quite understand that, because I didn't

MR. BROWN:

No, Your Honor, what -- where this

11

was occurring is, my client was an intervenor in hearings

12

before the New York State Public Service Commission, and

13

New York tells internal security -- and there's a mention

14

of it, to try to establish that my client was involved in

15

payment of certain personnel within the NYNEX group to

16

ensure it would get business.

17

How that ties in in terms of the allegation is,

18

there is a later allegation in the complaint, Your Honor,

19

that later MECo personnel came to the principal of my

20

client and said, if you will return all evidence of

21

discrimination, and you will agree to cooperate with this

22

scam, we'll let you provide services again to NYNEX.

23

I realize they're located in separate parts of

24

in time than it is a lack of a tie.

fact that what the buyer did was always buy from A?

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

AT&T Communications went in with a higher bid, it would --

2

the bid would be retracted and awarded to AT

3

Communications without any further notice to my client.

4

That's only one example.
QUESTION:

5

Well, is the fact that they

6

disqualified your client from bidding, perhaps, an answer

7

to the question?

8

MR. BROWN:

9

QUESTION:

They -In other words, they didn't just say,

10

I'm going to buy from A.

11

bid any more.

12

Is that enough as an additional fact?

13

They said, B, you cannot even

We are excluding you from that possibility.

MR. BROWN:

Your Honor, I believe that's another

14

additional fact.

15

not intend to comply with their own bidding procedures,

16

that they in fact were acting against their own best

17

interest.

18

I believe it would show that they did

QUESTION:

How is that any different from the

hypothesis of a requirements contract?

effect on your client, whether we say -- whether NYNEX

21

says, I'm going to have a requirements contract and buy my

22

stuff from X, or if they say, I won't have you bidding any

23

more.

It has the same

The result in each case is, you get nothing.
MR. BROWN:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think

I can answer that two ways.

First of all, the reason they entered into the

1

2

agreements with AT Communications was because AT

3

Communications would assist them in the regulatory evasion

4

scheme in the administratively controlled area, the

5

natural monopoly.

6

damage consumers by controlling the unregulated supplier

7

market.
That was the motive for entering into that

8

9

They could pass through the cost and

exclusive requirements contract, if we call it that, at

10

that point in time.

11

QUESTION:

But I asked you, what's the

12

difference between a requirements contract and the

13

statement to your client, we won't even have you bid?

14

MR. BROWN:

All right.

Your Honor, the reason

15

my client was forbidden -- assuming I'm not limited by the

16

hypothetical precisely, the reason my client was forbidden

17

to bid further was because it would not charge

18

supracompetitive prices and wanted to compete, and was in

19

direct communication with NYTel, which was found out, it

20

was forbidden, and then they decertified my client from

21

bidding.

QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't want to
I think I've made the points I -Well, it wouldn't impose on the Court

if you answered one question for me.

7

MR. YOUNG:

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

Certainly.

When your opponent kept referring to

10

AT&T Communications, was he really referring to AT&T

11

Technologies?

12

subsidiaries here.

I get a little mixed up with the

13

MR. YOUNG:

14

QUESTION:

AT -AT&T Technologies is the one, the

15

AT&T sub, that was the -- that actually provided the

16

removal services, was it not?

17

MR. YOUNG:

18

QUESTION:

19

meant Technologies.

20

MR. YOUNG:

I believe that's correct.
And so when he said Communications he

At one point I think when he was

21

talking about purchasers he referred to AT&T

22

Communications as a purchaser --

25

QUESTION:

That would have been this AT&T-C that

I was referring to earlier.
MR. YOUNG:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Right.

2

Do you also read the complaint the way he does,

3

just -- I guess you do, because you pointed out that

4

paragraph of the complaint.

5

concerned about is the market, purchases by New York

Telephone.

MR. YOUNG:

The only market we're

There are actually, I think, two

markets alleged.

one is New York Telephone market, but again, as I said, I

One is a New York State-wide market, and
