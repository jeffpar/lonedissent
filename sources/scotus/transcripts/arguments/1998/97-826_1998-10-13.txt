ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

14
15
16

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1996, Congress enacted general standards

17

designed to bring competition to local telecommunications

18

markets rapidly and throughout the country.

19

it expressly extended Federal law to cover the rates,

20

terms, and conditions under which incumbents must provide

21

new entrants access to their facilities.

22

In doing so,

No one doubts that the FCC has authority to

23

promulgate some rules interpreting these provisions.

24

jurisdictional issue presented in this case is whether in

25

certain specific respects, principally regarding the

The

1

methodology for setting lease rates for network elements,

2

Congress has for the first time denied the PCC rulemaking

3

authority with respect to a substantive provision of the

4

Communications Act.

5

The answer is no.

The 1996 amendments preserved

6

the Commission's existing authority under section 201(b)

7

to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be

8

necessary in the public interest to carry out the

9

provisions of this act.

10

QUESTION:

But, General Waxman, 201(b) -- you

11

find before that, of course, naturally 201(a), and there

12

it says, it shall be the duty of every common carrier

13

engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or

14

radio.

15

provision is limited to that kind of things?

16
17

So, don't you think the rule -- the rulemaking

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I don't, Mr. Chief Justice, and

for a variety of reasons.

18

First of all, section 201(b), in which the

19

relevant rulemaking grant is not so limited -- and we

20

think that in any event, the specific sentence in 201(b)

21

that I quoted should be interpreted according to its plain

22

meaning.

23
24
25

Moreover, in the -QUESTION:

But you think its plain meaning means

it should extend beyond the section in which it's found?
MR. WAXMAN:

I think that it means -- section

1

201(a) is -- itself is limited to intrastate and foreign

2

commerce.

3

limited.

The last sentence of section 201(b) is not so

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

Yes, but -And I think it should be

interpreted according to its terms.

7

QUESTION:

But, you know, if this were a general

8

thing that were to extend throughout the Federal

9

communications statutes, why would you find it tucked away

10

here at the very end of section 201(b)?
MR. WAXMAN:

11
12

13

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, two

responses.
First of all, in -- in I think what can only be

14

described as belt and suspenders, the Commission has other

15

statutory provisions that granted the same plenary-

16

rulemaking authority, 47 U.S.C., section 154(i) and

17

section 303(r).

18

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't that suggest that

19

each of those grants is limited to the sections in which

20

they're found?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't think it does, and

22

moreover, with respect to 201(b), it's clear that Congress

23

in 1996 had this section specifically in mind because

24

section 251(i) of the 1996 amendments, which is entitled

25

Savings Provision, specifically says that nothing in this

1

act shall be deemed to limit -- nothing in section 251

2

shall be deemed to limit or impair the applicability of

3

the provisions of section 201.

4

Congress had it in mind and wanted it to be interpreted

5

according to its plain meaning, but -QUESTION:

6

7

MR. WAXMAN:

9

QUESTION:

11

But -- but if shall not be deemed to

impair 201, 201 contains (a) as well as (b).

8

10

So, we think it --

That'S true.
And it could be read as a limitation

on (b).
MR. WAXMAN:

I do think, with respect, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, first of all, that that would require you to read

13

the sentence, the rulemaking provision in 201(b), not in

14

accordance with its plain meaning.

15

And secondly, the 1996 act itself, in any event,

16

in section 251(d)(1) mandated the FCC within 6 months to

17

promulgate rules, quote, as necessary to implement the

18

requirements of this section, and that section requires

19

incumbents to provide access to network elements at rates

20

that are just, reasonable, and in accordance with the

21

terms of section 252.

22

The fact that section 252 itself directs State

23

commissions in arbitration proceedings to set the specific

24

rates charged by a particular carrier in a particular

25

market for a particular element is completely consistent

with the FCC's authority to prescribe the general

2

methodology by which those rates should be set.

3

fact --

4

QUESTION:

In

Staying with 201(a) for just a

5

minute, if the suggestion by the Chief Justice were one we

6

thought correct, and the first sentence in (a) was a

7

limitation on the rule -- the last sentence in the

8

rulemaking authority in (b), do you have a fall-back

9

position with, oh, we're really talking about interstate

10

commerce anyway?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Well -Or -- or is -- is -- would -- would

13

your case necessarily founder if we accepted the Chief

14

Justice's --

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18
19

It -- my case would
-- suggestion?
My case wouldn't founder at all for

three reasons.
First of all, section 154(i) of the act provides

20

in a general provision that's not limited to radio or

21

cable or anything else, similarly provides the Commission

22

with broad rulemaking authority to implement for any

23

provisions of the act.

24
25

Second of all, section 251(d) is an express
jurisdictional mandate to promulgate rules implementing
10

(800) FOR DEPO

1

the provisions of 251 which includes the requirements that

2

rates be reasonable and in accordance with section 252.
And finally, if your question is directed at the

3
4

operation, I guess, of section 2(b) of the act, we think

5

that section 2(b) of the act, which is a rule of

6

construction, is inapplicable to this case because

7

sections 251 and 252 apply Federal law to facilities that

8

are used interchangeably for both interstate and

9

intrastate calls.

Just like the telephone handset that we

10

use every day, the local telephone network is neither an

11

intrastate or an interstate facility.
QUESTION:

12

It's both.

Well, if you applied that argument,

13

then 2(b) wouldn't have kept -- wouldn't have kept the FCC

14

out of intrastate phone rates, even -- even before the

15

1996 act.

I mean, doesn't that prove too much?
MR. WAXMAN:

16

No, it doesn't prove too much

17

because before the 1996 act -- well, first of all, before

18

the 1996 act, the FCC did regulate how local incumbents

19

charge other carriers for use of their network, for

20

example, in the cases involving exchange access or private

21

lines or customer provided equipment.
QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

But only with regard to interstate

calls.
MR. WAXMAN:

No, with respect to both.

All of

the court of appeals' rulings upholding the jurisdiction

1

of the FCC with respect to private lines and customer

2

premises equipment were premised on the fact that these

3

are used inextricably for both.

4

has rulemaking authority with respect to the interstate

5

component, under footnote 4 of this Court's decision in

6

Louisiana Public Service Commission, they had authority to

7

regulate the use of all of the uses, interstate and

8

intrastate, of those elements because they could not be,

9

quote, separated.
And, moreover, the section 2(b) does not apply

10
11

And since the FCC clearly

to this case for two independent reasons.
First, because no construction of any provision

12

13

of the law is required.

14

sections 251 and 252 indisputably apply to intrastate

15

matters, and sections 201(b) and 2 -QUESTION:

16
17

MR. WAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

21

Well, you mean they're parts of the

act that don't have to be construed?

18

20

The local competition provision,

Well, I don't think -Is that the gravamen of your

argument?
MR. WAXMAN:

I -- no, I think the import of

22

section 2(b), as this Court announced in Louisiana Public

23

Service Commission, is that an -- a provision of the

24

Communications Act won't be understood to apply to a

25

purely interstate matter unless it clearly does.

It's not

1

a rule that says disregard what everybody agrees the act

2

does.
QUESTION:

3

Don't you think 2(b) has been

4

repealed by the -- it is impossible, is it not, after the

5

1960 -- 1996 act, to give effect to 2(b)?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

7

QUESTION:

Oh, I don't think so at all.
Why?

How is it possible to -- not to

8

construe any provision of the act to apply to intrastate

9

communications?
MR. WAXMAN:

10

Well, I think it is not possible to

11

apply any provisions of the --or certainly the provisions

12

that we're dealing with here, 251, 252, 253, 254, 271, as

13

dealing inextricably with interstate and intrastate

14

matters.

15

But the -- there is nothing in the act, for

16

example, that would permit the FCC to impose or to take

17

away the State commissions' authority to set maximum

18

retail rates for -- for customers.

19

Congress had repealed section 2(b) or made section 2(b)

20

inapplicable to these sections -- I don't know whether it

21

would have, but the FCC could have said, well, we've now

22

got ancillary jurisdiction to take over the State's retail

23

ratemaking function.

24
25

QUESTION:

And, in fact, if

But 2(b) has its exceptions written

in, except as provided in sections 223 through 227,

1

inclusive, and section 332, and subject to 301 in title 6.

2

Nothing in this act shall be construed to apply or give

3

the Commission jurisdiction with respect to, blah, blah,

4

blah, blah, blah.

5

anymore.

6

It's just impossible to apply that

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, we think that it is, in fact,

7

impossible to apply it to the local competition provisions

8

in this case, first, because those provisions plainly do

9

apply to interstate matters, and the FCC has statutory

10
11

authority to implement them.
And second -- and this is a fundamental,

12

independent point -- even if 2(b) applied under the rule

13

expressed in footnote 4 of Louisiana Public Service

14

Commission, because there is also no doubt that 251 and

15

252 also apply inextricably to interstate matters over

16

which the Commission has unquestioned jurisdiction.

17

QUESTION:

As to your first argument, are you

18

saying that the act has changed the boundaries between

19

what's local and what's interstate?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

1

QUESTION:

-- that it -- that it has made what

2

was previously thought to be local now interstate.

3

the act -- so the prohibition of 2(b) is irrelevant.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

So,

I think, Justice Kennedy, rather

5

than say change the definition, the definitions were

6

already becoming quite blurred, as I've indicated, by the

7

decisions involving private lines and private branch

8

exchanges and exchange access.

9
10

QUESTION:
MR. WAXMAN:

Are those decisions of this Court?
They're all decisions of the FCC

11

that were -- that were approved on appeal without --

12

without exception by the courts of appeals.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WAXMAN:

By courts of appeals?
And some of those decisions, Mr.

15

Chief Justice, are referred to or referenced in footnote 4

16

of this Court's opinion in Louisiana Public Service

17

Commission.

18

What the -- Justice Kennedy, what the act did,

19

if you look at sections 251 and 252, it doesn't even use

20

the words interstate or intrastate because Congress

21

recognized that the use of network elements is -- is

22

inextricably entwined with both, and what it --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So, then Justice Scalia is right,

that 2(b) is just not really applicable anymore.
MR. WAXMAN:

We think that it is not applicable

1

with respect to these provisions, and to the extent that

2

it did apply, the exception for inseverability would

3

nonetheless give the FCC the authority to promulgate rules

4

about this methodology.

5

QUESTION:

But what about using 2(b) in what I

6

think is a rather difficult statutory problem, which is to

7

reconcile -- assuming there is rulemaking authority,

8

reconcile the word rates, you know, in 251 where it talks

9

about unbundled access.

It says there's a duty to provide

10

unbundled access, you know, at rates that are just and

11

reasonable.

12

that State commissions will establish rates, and they have

13

to be just and reasonable.

14

And then when you get over to 252, it says

Now, why wouldn't 2(b) come in right there,

15

trying to interpret and reconcile those two words?

16

in both --

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Right.

Rates

There's --

-- reconciling them by saying -There's nothing --- look at history and look at the

21

extent to which a rate is traditionally up to the carrier

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS
MR. ENNIS:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to make two points.

11

The potential

12

competitors have challenged the Eighth Circuit's

13

jurisdictional ruling because the inevitable and now

14

demonstrated effect of that ruling has been to severely

15

undermine the prospects for rapid competition, which was

16

the principal purpose of this act.

17

Because State commissions had first to determine

18

the meaning of the Federal rate requirements before they

19

could establish particular rates, they failed to meet the

20

9-month deadline for establishing rates required by

21

Congress.

22

Moreover, there are already hundreds of Federal

23

district court challenges to the State arbitration

24

decisions, and the vast majority of them specifically

25

challenge the rate methodologies employed by the States.

would be the question whether the exercise of that

your question, Justice Scalia.
The point I was trying to make is that section

3

271 and, in fact, section 252 (e) (6) and section 160 and

4

numerous sections of the act plainly require the FCC

5

itself, at some point in the process, to determine the

6

meaning of the Federal rate requirements, a traditional

7

authority for a Federal agency interpreting Federal law

8

that is supposed to be, as the conference report says,

9

nationally uniform.

Why would Congress want to give that

-- that very clear authority to the FCC at the back end of

the process and withhold it at the beginning?

Justice Souter, I think the FCC, as

necessary in order to ensure local competition, just as it

has the authority under --

QUESTION:

Would it do -- would it have that

authority at the front end as well as at the back end?
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

At the

back end, it clearly has it.

Under 253, if the States set

16

rates that the FCC concludes are anti-competitive rates,

17

it can squarely preempt those rates, and I think it would

have the same jurisdictional authority at the front end.

19

Whether on the merits it would be okay under Chevron

deference is a different question.

there are other interpretive anomalies that flow from the

in section 251 which discusses the regulatory

MS. MUNNS:

What's your answer to that?

Section 252(c) that you're referring

That's no different from Chevron.

Justice Scalia, is that in the Chevron context, one would

tell the governing Federal agency that within a

11

permissible range of meanings, we're not going to decide

what it means.

We're actually going to let you decide

That's different from saying we decide

What Justice

Ginsburg said was about the limits on what it means.

That's right.
But in section 6 of duties, it

imposes a duty upon a carrier to make an unbundled element

Now, the Commission, if we assume they have some

question -- at least have authority to determine when a

Justice Breyer, there's nothing in

this intricate statute --

authority to speak to the issue of reasonableness of

MR. TRIBE:

1

But then there is section 253, which

2

says that when a particular system of any kind, not just

3

about rates, when a policy or order or regulation has been

4

promulgated by a State and when you can show, when the

5

Commission can show after notice and hearing that it, that

6

particular one, will operate as an impermissible barrier

7

to competition, then it may be preempted, says the

statute, but only to the extent necessary to cure the

9

violation.

It seems to me -QUESTION:

10

Do I have to choose between all or

none?

section 6 and the negative phrase, rulemaking authority,

13

later on as giving the Commission the authority to say

when something, a system, for example, is unreasonable,

but not to dictate which among several systems should --

16

the State should use?

17

That is -- that is, could we view the word rates in

MR. TRIBE:

I think, Justice Breyer, as long as

18

it does that not ex ante and across the board, but by

19

looking at a particular action of a State, then it's

20

operating within the ambit of the statute.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you.
But this statute rejects I think

23

very clearly anything that resembles a kind of prior

perhaps you could understand the distinction the SG is

making between rulemaking, which he says is for us,

right down to the last details, the way their proxy prices

did, where they averaged from six States and applied

7

specifics -- basically he's saying rulemaking is for us

8

and applying is for you.

9

But if you look at 252(d), it's very clear that

10

when the States set prices, they are doing it, quote, for

11

MR. TRIBE:

Under 253(d) the mechanism is

described.

If after notice and an opportunity for

comment, the Commission determines that a State or local

government has permitted or imposed any statute,

regulation, or legal requirement that violates subsection

(a) which talks about excluding competition, then its

MR. TRIBE:

FCC is permitted essentially in this limited special area

of rates -- and there are a few others in the statute like

MR. TRIBE:

MR. BARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
I'm Bill Barr and I'm representing the local
telephone companies.

16

To promote local phone competition, Congress

17

granted a right of access to incumbent facilities, and

18

this required drawing a line, a line through the business

19

of the local telephone companies.

20

On one side of the line where no access is

21

granted, the entrants are told here is where you can and

22

should compete.

23

Here is where you try to become more efficient.

24

where competition is, and the more of that the merrier.

25

Here is where you put in your inputs.
That's

there may be areas where we can't have competition because

of the legacy of monopoly.

you to replicate or duplicate the input of the incumbent,

4

and so here, you may have access.

Maybe it is not fair to ask

Now, in drawing this line, Congress set two

5
6

standards.

First, it said, the only thing you can get

7

access to are network facilities.

8

we expect you to compete.

9

even as to network facilities, you don't automatically get

As to everything else,

You put in your inputs.

all of those.

11

you can, but if the FCC finds that there is part of the

12

facility that you need, that if you fail to get it, it

13

will impair your ability to offer service, then you can

14

use that and get access to that part.

15

We want you to compete there too the best

Now, we're not here today because we are

We're here because the FCC obliterated those

in offering to the public -- is up for grabs.

So, what does this mean?

This is the most

promiscuous right of access that you can imagine.

They haven't taken our mousetrap.

And to

MR. BARR:

Now, let's look at what they did on

12

Paragraphs 278, 285, and 286.

13

251(d)(2), apply a need-based standard, determine whether

14

their failure to get access will impair their ability to

15

provide service.

Three paragraphs in the order are dispositive.

16

Congress said in section

That's what you have to consider.

What do they do?

They obliterate that standard.

17

They adopt a rule in paragraphs 285 and 286 that say we

refuse to look at any alternative outside the incumbent's

network.

Before you go away from the need and

13

impair, what would be a fair way of implementing that

14

statutory provision?

15

MR. BARR:

What the FCC should have done was to

16

engage in the fundamental task here, which is to

17

differentiate what are the advantages and the things about

18

the incumbent's business that can be fairly competed

19

against, that can be counteracted by an effective

20

competitor, and what are the things in their business that

21

even an effective competitor could not reasonably

22

counteract in a short period of time because of the legacy

23

of monopoly.

24
25

They never made that differentiation.

That's absolutely correct.

In fact,

10

in Canada, the only thing unbundled is the loop, and in

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Because Congress has authorized the FCC to

19

promulgate rules implementing the Communications Act,

20

those rules must be given effect unless they are

21

arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or manifestly

22

contrary to the statute.

23

There are five substantive rules that are at

issue in this portion of the case, and each one is fully

25

consistent with the text of the act.

object to those rules based on their predictions about how

2

competition will proceed if the rules were permitted to go

3

into effect.
But each of those objections was considered by

4
5

the Commission within the mandatory 6-month period and in

6

an atmosphere in which there was no competition to speak

7

of in any market, and the Commission, after hearing

8

thousands and tens of thousands of pages of comments,

9

resolved those policy objections on the record in a manner

10

that promotes the paramount objective of the 1996

11

amendments to produce vigorous competition in this

12

country's monopoly local telephone markets as rapidly as

13

possible by giving potential new entrants a range of

14

competitive options.
Take, for example, the two issues that, at least

First, this is rule 315(b).

Applying the

20

nondiscrimination requirement of section 251(c)(3) that we

incumbents from imposing completely gratuitous costs on

23

new entrants by ripping apart network elements that are

24

already combined in the incumbent's system.

That is correct.

In section 254 of the act, Congress mandated an

end to this monopoly-based system to be replaced by a new

10

system of explicit charges, applied equally among all

carriers, regardless of the means by which they compete.

The FCC is implementing its part of the reform, and it has

found on the record that the State commissions will do as

Because for years and years Bell Atlantic has had to

isn't there fear that new incumbents will use the

MR. WAXMAN:

I will -- okay, I will take a try,

16

The assertion that allowing new entrants to

lease all network elements would obliterate resale as a

competitive option is both empirically wrong, as the

Commission found on the record -- and I will point you to

20

the provisions -- but it is also -- and before I get to

it, I think it fundamentally misconceives the statute.

There is no textual basis in the statute for preferring

customers can only receive competition through resale.

And in general, residential customers who don't make long­

21

The Commission also found -- I think it's

advantages and disadvantages with respect to leasing

elements, leasing elements has greater risks and

they say, runs the risk that people will, where in fact

QUESTION:

Just before you do that, would you -

was there conditioning of the long-distance carrier on the

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, and that relates to my

So, the new

And in response to you, Justice Ginsburg, when

5

the -- when the FCC found that only people who engaged in

6

resale under (c)(4) were prohibited from jointly --

7

jointly marketing long-distance services, it was on the

8

basis that it only covered resale, didn't prohibit owners

9

of facilities, and that lessees of network elements had

10

investments like those of owners, not like those of

11

resellers.

12

And the difference between resale and -- and

13

leasing network elements is absolutely fundamental.

14

you -- when you're a reseller under (c)(4), you're just

15

buying the same services that each of us use in our homes,
