ORAL ARGUMENT OF GALE NORTON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

GENERAL NORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Colorado views the initiative process as an

12

essential part of our law-making function.

13

initiative is the first section under the Colorado

14

constitution under the heading, Legislative Department.

15

Because this is an important process to State government

16

we have established a limited structure of regulation

17

intended to safeguard the people's right to democratic

18

self-government while ensuring the fairness of our

19

election process.

20

The right of

Beyond the two viewpoints represented in the

21

courtroom today, there are two other important interests

22

that are protected through our regulatory process.

23

first is the interest of those who may oppose an

24

initiative, and the second is the interest of the signers

25

of the petition.

QUESTION:

May I ask just one factual question?

2

GENERAL NORTON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I understand there's a final

4

reporting requirement, a disclosure requirement, and that

5

is not challenged here.

6

GENERAL NORTON:

That is correct.

It is the

7

reports that deal with the monthly reporting requirement

8

as to the individual petition circulators.

9

QUESTION:

Well, does the financial disclosure

10

that's made at the end, and it's not challenged, separate

11

out the amount that's paid for solicitors, so if I read

12

the report I know that they spent X dollars for TV

13

advertising and Y dollars for -- to pay circulators?

14

I -- can I find that out from the final report?

15

GENERAL NORTON:

Do

The final report would list all

16

of the expenditures included among the expenditures of the

17

sponsoring campaign committee - -

18
19

QUESTION:

What I'm asking, is it a lump sum, or

is it separated out?

20

GENERAL NORTON:

21

QUESTION:

22

And when is that final report due?

Is that before the election or after?

23

GENERAL NORTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

It is separated out in detail.

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

It would also show the amounts that

went to the individual petition circulators?

QUESTION:

The monthly reports are while

But when the completed petition is

there, and the sponsor says, we have enough votes, at that
time the so-called final report would go in?

Isn't that when

Your Honor, I'm not sure what

the due date is for the final report.

13

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the monthly

14

disclosure statements that break it down expenditure by

15

expenditure, so if I looked at the monthly disclosure

16

statement, could I see how much was paid just for

17

circulating?

18

GENERAL NORTON:

The monthly disclosure

19

statement lists the amounts that are paid to each

20

individual circulator on a person-by-person basis.

21

QUESTION:

That was struck down.

Has anything

GENERAL NORTON:

Signature - gathering serves the

14

same function as a primary election in a candidate

15

selection process.

16

signatures, an initiative's backers establish that it has

17

a significant modicum of support.

GENERAL NORTON:

Here, there are three functions

2

that all occur simultaneously.

3

persuasiveness, as you have described.

4

role that the circulator plays of an administrative

5

function akin to an election judge, and there is also the

6

function of acting as an agent or fiduciary for the signer

7

in fulfilling responsibilities as to the signer.

QUESTION:

That is the aspect of
There is also a

Well, do -- is there any way of

telling from this record whether the typical petitioner

10

circulator goes door to door, or sits in a shopping mall?

11

I suppose they do both.

12

GENERAL NORTON:

They may do both.

The practice

13

is ordinarily to go to a shopping mall or some place where

14

there are many people gathered.

15

QUESTION:

16

GENERAL NORTON:

17
18

The --

And so --- record does not specifically

describe that in the trial court.
QUESTION:

What is the interest of the State

19

that you say supports the requirement that the circulators

20

have to be registered voters?

21

GENERAL NORTON:

That is two-part.

First of

22

all, is because they are fulfilling a law-making function,

23

we as a State should be able to say that those who are

24

fulfilling that function should be people who are

25

committed to - 7

QUESTION:

1

In light of Meyer, I would have

2

thought the State would have a hard time asserting that

3

its interest in having them be registered voters can

4

prevail.

5

No doubt there are people in the State who are

6

not registered voters, but who nonetheless would like to

7

serve as petition circulators and debate the merits of

8

given issues.
GENERAL NORTON:

9

We are happy to have people

10

debate the merits and to enter into a persuasive function.

11

It is only when they perform the administrative election

12

judge type functions of ensuring that those who are

13

signing the petition are who they say they are, that a

14

husband is not signing for a wife --

15

QUESTION:

Well --

16

QUESTION:

Well, why can't somebody who is a

17

resident of Colorado, who's an adult resident, perform

18

that function just as well as somebody who's a registered

19

voter?

20

I just don't understand.
GENERAL NORTON:

The registration requirement is

21

different from a residency requirement in that it requires

22

a person to swear an oath that they are a resident of the

23

State before they begin the circulating process.

24

a requirement that they do so at the end of the

25

circulating process as part of the affidavit if

There is

But here, we have an assurance all the way

through the process that they're going to be here.

circulate petitions.

We have had the

If those people are not going to be

Yes, but you require an affidavit at

11

the end of the day, when the petition is filed, that the

12

circulator is, in fact, a resident.

13

GENERAL NORTON:

14
15

That is ordinarily our

process - QUESTION:

And you have the normal criminal laws

16

that could enforce that, so it's very difficult for me to

17

understand, in the face of Meyer, what State justification

18

you can offer for also requiring that the circulator be a

19

registered voter.

20

GENERAL NORTON:

This would ensure that they are

21

a resident throughout the entire time that they are

22

circulating the petition, rather than just at the moment

23

they submit - -

Why isn't that --

the registered voters that if you don't want to count

10

yourself in the political community by not voting, you

11

shouldn't take part in this, or is it simply a kind of way

12

of verifying that the person is, indeed, a resident?
GENERAL NORTON:

13

It is a way of verifying that a

14

person is, indeed, a resident, and that is correct, but it

15

is also -- there's also two parts.

16

someone is playing a formal role in the process, which

17

they are doing, we would require that they be registered

18

voters in a way as part of being committed to the Colorado

19

law-making process, just as we require our legislators to

20

be committed, just as we require election judges and those

21

who participate in nominating conventions to be registered

voters.

If they want to participate in the purely

QUESTION:

2

How do you get around the fact that,

3

despite the complexity of function, and I will concede to

4

you that they are performing functions in the electoral

5

process, how do you get around the fact that Meyer says

6

they're also engaging in core speech, and if they're

7

engaging in core speech, they're going to be -- your

8

restrictions are going to be judged on a very restrictive

9

standard.

How do you get around Meyer in that respect?

QUESTION:

Why is that?

Let's talk about -- why

is it easier to prevent fraud somehow when you're dealing

with a resident than with a nonresident?

Coloradans are more honest than non-Coloradans?

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

Is that the rationale?

so.

GENERAL NORTON:

We may know that they live in

we cannot prosecute them for having engaged in fraud.

QUESTION:

Have you ever prosecuted any

GENERAL NORTON:

1

Yes, we have.

In the record it

2

shows the 1992 cycle, in which we successfully prosecuted

3

three people for forgery.

others, but were not able to serve the warrant because

5

they had left the State.

QUESTION:

We attempted to prosecute three

Were these gatherers or signers?
These were gatherers.

I'll grant you it would be easier if

you didn't have to go to California, but I mean, if the

10

fraud is serious you can start an extradition proceeding,

11

can't you?
GENERAL NORTON:

QUESTION:

We were not able to, as a

Well, why, because it cost too much

money?
GENERAL NORTON:

16

It would have --we had a

17

problem with our -- because it is a misdemeanor in some

18

situations, we would not be able to do that.

In other

19

situations it was trying to serve warrants.

We were not

20

able to do that.
QUESTION:

21

But the only justification for the

22

registration requirement you've given us is that it's

23

easier to find their address if they're registered.

24

Right?

25

GENERAL NORTON:

No.

It's twofold.

petitions circulated in order to enable someone to run as

GENERAL NORTON:

19

QUESTION:

20

That is correct.

Does Colorado law require that those

circulators be registered voters?

21

GENERAL NORTON:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

So presumably the same argument made

here today with regard to the petition circulation would

apply to candidate petitions as well --

QUESTION:

GENERAL NORTON:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Suppose that it were shown that in

4

most cases in Colorado initiatives were circulated by paid

solicitors who didn't really care which side they were on,

they were just doing it to get the pay, they'd circulate a

petition on either side of any issue.

the fact most of the time.
Would that undermine the rationale of our recent

I doubt that we would want to revisit it.
I noticed in your brief that you seem to be

3

questioning the rationale that core speech does take place

4

at the init --at the signature-gathering stage.

5

GENERAL NORTON:

The Burdick approach that we

6

would urge the Court to adopt recognizes that there is

7

both core speech aspect, where there would be a severe

8

burden on that speech, potentially, and the ability of the

9

States to have a regulatory process.

20

QUESTION:

Burdick was in the context of a

21

primary election, with rules about parties and so forth,

22

and the assumption of Meyers was that a core speech

23

function, a very viable speech function in the initiative

24

process takes place at the signature-gathering stage, so

25

that it's not analogous to the candidate qualifying thing,

and I'm asking if you think that distinction holds.
GENERAL NORTON:

Meyer, I believe, did not

adequately recognize the other aspects of the process.

4

focused on the core speech part, which was truly at issue

5

in Meyer, and did not look at the other issues of the

6

State in - -

7

QUESTION:

Are you saying that core speech does

8

not take place routinely in the signature-gathering

9

process, and you're denying that as an empirical matter

10

that the Court is factually wrong?

11

GENERAL NORTON:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

It

No.

Core speech --

Well, you can say we're wrong if you

think we're wrong.
GENERAL NORTON:

In terms of advocacy, that is

15

one part of it, but there are several transactions taking

16

place simultaneously.

17

QUESTION:

How much do we actually know about

18

this, or how much did we know about it in Meyer?

19

that we have of trying to maintain the integrity of the

process as it is going along.
If the Secretary of State's office receives a

people to sign petitions, which is clearly a violation of

General Norton, if you have the

badge that says, paid solicitor, and the sponsor's name,

12

just not that person's name, then the burden that you have

been informing us of is substantially reduced, is it not?

5

GENERAL NORTON:

Even under those circumstances

6

it is an individual violation for the circulator to engage

7

in misconduct, and the sponsor may or may not be able to

8

identify who is standing on a particular street corner, or

9

who is in a picture.

10

QUESTION:

Are you this careful in registering

11

voters, as opposed to collecting petitions that would undo

12

the work of the legislature?

13

You see, I come into this with the attitude that

14

legislatures don't like these things, because they're

15

usually collected in order to do something that the

16

legislature doesn't want it to, or to undo something that

17

the legislature has done.

18

Now, has your legislature been this concerned

19

about the slightest chance of fraud with respect to, let

20

us say, registering to vote?

21

GENERAL NORTON:

That is something that has been

22

largely dictated by Federal legislation in recent years

23

that has caused us to make our laws less strict.

We used to be more careful than

You are correct that we are not able to

QUESTION:

4

If -- I just have one question I'd

5

like to ask, which is that if -- I assume -- I'll assume

6

for argument's sake that you're right, that there's an

7

aspect in which this petition-gatherer is like a voting

8

official who sits in a booth, so the State can regulate,

9

but that petition-gatherer is also a person who's likely

10

to try to persuade someone to sign the petition, and to

11

that extent there's speech involved, persuasive political

12

speech, so if I think there's both, what standard do I

13

apply, and which case do you look to to give me the right

14

standard?

15

In other words, I think there's a lot of speech

16

involved, but I also think it's pretty important that the

State can regulate its process for making laws.

both, what case do I look to?

Mr. O'Toole, may I ask you another

question about the state of the record?

The State - - one

of the important State interests here is to catch the

people who are bribing people to sign petitions, and

there's sort of a presumption that paid circulators may do

that rather often.

Does the record contain any evidence indicating

how -- what percentage of paid circulators engage in this

kind of conduct and what percentage don't?

I mean,

10

normally we presume people are innocent until they're

MR. O'TOOLE:

Absolutely.

Okay.

Now, what evidence was there

being tainted with fraud, found that there had been fraud

MR. O'TOOLE:

Absolutely.

So I assume he would have an interest

The

only issue in that disclosure is the requirement that
