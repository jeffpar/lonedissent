ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEVERLY P. DOWNING

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. DOWNING:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Title II-A of the Americans with Disabilities

12

Act, that general language prohibiting discrimination by

13

reason of disability, cannot impose a least restrictive

14

treatment requirement on the State's provision of hospital

15

services to its disabled citizens.

16

By reenacting essentially the same language of

17

section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1 73, Congress

18

did not suddenly impose or allow the Department of Justice

1

to impose de-institutionalization on the States.

20

believes that this expansive new interpretation of the ADA

21

is precluded by the language of the statute, is precluded

22

by the Court's prior interpretations of section 504, would

23

require a plain statement in the statute which is

24

undeniably missing, and that the Federal Government's

25

inconsistent interpretation of its integration regulation

2

is not entitled to deference.
Here, the general language of the statute

3

prohibiting discrimination by reason of disability is

4

being used to bar the provision of hospital services

5

offered on a voluntary basis unless Georgia, at the same

6

time, fully funds all demand for another service, a

7

community bed.

8

bed and by asking the person to wait a short time until a

9

community bed is available, Georgia does not exclude a

But by providing a person with a hospital

10

person by reason of disability, neither does Georgia

11

discriminate against her by reason of disability.

12

What Georgia did here was simply to provide

13

hospital services to two mentally disabled patients.

14

There appears to be little debate as to the involuntary

15

treatment that was provided to these patients when they

16

were eminently dangerous to themselves or others and did

17

not consent to that treatment.

18

Georgia law, the Constitution, and presumably the ADA to

19

confine them involuntarily without a medical and

20

dangerousness justification.

21

and there appears to be little contention that they did.

22

QUESTION:

It would be illegal under

23

dimensions of this case, do I understand correctly that

You're not challenging that on the facts, but you're

saying they must wait their turn on line.

that your position?

6

So, it's not that they need to institution.

Is that -- is

Or are you saying they may not

MS. DOWNING:

Your Honor, at the point that the

7

patients were placed, they did -- they were appropriate

8

for placement in the community and they did have to wait a

9

short time in order to make their way up the waiting list.

10

There were times prior to the time that they were placed

11

when the parties would dispute whether they were

12

appropriate for community treatment or not, but at the

13

time that they were placed and for a short time before, we

14

would agree that they were appropriate.

15

QUESTION:

Your position is - - is as I - - if I

16

understand it correctly, is -- is much further than that.

17

I -- I understood it to be that it's up to the State to

18

decide what voluntary facilities it will make available

19

for the -- for the mentally ill, that if the State chooses

20

to have only institutional facilities, it may do that.

21

And if it chooses to have, in addition, community-based

22

facilities, it may have them in addition, but it will be

23

up to the State how many people it will put in those --

24

allow to go into those community-based facilities, because

25

we're talking here about voluntary admissions.

Right?

MS. DOWNING:

Your Honor, it's our understanding

2

that -- that it's actually the Government's position that

3

the State would not be required to have community

I'm not saying whether there are.

Do

you think Georgia is required to have community placements

by this statute?

We think that if Georgia is

10

required to - - to expand their community placements by

11

this statute - -

That's not the question I asked.

Is

Georgia required to have community placements?
MS. DOWNING:

We don't think --no.

placements.

QUESTION:

18

MS. DOWNING:

19

QUESTION:

I didn't think you said that.

Okay.

That's correct.

Now, could - - as I understand it, the

20

act provides that the Attorney General will promulgate

21

regulations, and it goes on to say that those regulations

22

will be consistent with the Disabilities Act and with

23

regulations promulgated under section 504 of the

24

Rehabilitation Act.

25

Is that right?

MS. DOWNING:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

1

And there was a regulation adopted

2

under section 504 saying that no otherwise qualified

3

handicapped individual would be excluded from

4

participation and/or denied the benefits of or subjected

5

to discrimination, and that services had to be provided in

6

the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs.

7

that true under the Rehab Act?

8

MS. DOWNING:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Under the --

And the same regulation was then

adopted by the Attorney General under the Disabilities

11

Act.

QUESTION:

setting?

15

Is

That -- that's correct.

Is there any definition of integrated

Do we know what that is?
MS. DOWNING:

Well, what we know is that the

16

original integration regulation was promulgated by HEW in

17

1977, and that the rule -- the notice at that point

18

described it as providing access to treatment.

19

examples that it gave were that a Medicaid provider would

20

need to make its services available to the handicapped.

21

For instance, a doctor would need to have a ramp, a

22

wheelchair ramp, to get into the facility.

1

the examples that were given there did not ever mention

2

least restrictive treatment or anything like it.

3

QUESTION:

Well, this --do you challenge the

4

regulation that was adopted by the Attorney General, or do

5

you challenge the interpretation of that regulation?

6

you say that the Attorney General lacked authority to

7

adopt that regulation?

8

MS. DOWNING:

9

Do

We don't say that the Attorney

General lacked authority to promulgate it in the way that

10

it was interpreted at the time.

11

interpretation that it's being given today, as of 1994 in

12

the Helen L. case for the first time, is a reversal of the

13

prior interpretation.

14

QUESTION:

What we say is that the

Well, so what this case actually

15

turns on, when you sort all other things around it, is the

16

meaning of the regulation saying it must be in the most

17

integrated setting appropriate.

18

MS. DOWNING:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. DOWNING:

Is that right?

Yes.

Is that what it boils down to?
That's what it boils down to, Your

21

Honor, and that the new interpretation of the regulation

22

actually would be precluded by the language of the

23

statute, which requires discrimination by reason of

24

disability.

25

reason of disability applies to - - requires even-handed

It's our position that discrimination by

treatment of the handicapped relative to the non­

2

handicapped.

3

That was the primary focus of the act.

QUESTION:

May -- may I ask you about that?

4

Because it seems to me that your argument in this respect

5

assumes that there is some kind of uniform and unvarying

6

class of persons who are handicapped.

7

that that is not so.

8

There are handicaps of all sorts of degrees, and -- and

And it seems to me

There are all sorts of handicaps.

recognizing the degree that is involved, let -- let me put
10

this question to you and ask you to -- to explain your

11

position in relation to it.

12

Let's assume that there is a class of

13

handicapped persons who, because of their handicaps, are

14

simply unsuited to live outside of an institution.

15

secondly that there are a group of handicapped individuals

16

who can perfectly well live outside the institution

17

despite the handicap.

18

there's a general population of people who don't live in

institutions.

And, of course, assume, three,

If the Government treats the second group, those

21

whose handicaps are irrelevant to institutionalization,

22

the same way it treats the first group, those who have to

that case isn't the Government engaging in the

discrimination on the basis of handicap to the -- in -- in

relation to the second group?

MS. DOWNING:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. DOWNING:

We would say no,

that the --

Why not?
-- the second group which you

7

posited needs a certain level of treatment, that this

8

level of treatment can be provided appropriately in the

9

hospital and that the person can benefit from that

10
11

treatment provided in the hospital.
QUESTION:

So, you're saying that if

12

hospitalization would provide some appropriate treatment,

13

that in effect renders irrelevant the fact that an

14

individual can live outside the institution and presumably

15

get the treatment on a - - on a day care basis or something

16

of that sort.

17

That's basically your argument.

MS. DOWNING:

We wouldn't say that it renders

18

irrelevant.

19

the person could also be treated in the community would

20

not make hospital treatment discriminatory.

21

very structure of the Medicaid Act presumed that this was

22

the case, and under the Medicaid Act, Congress has always

favored institutional treatment over community treatment.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In enacting the ADA, Congress declared that its

10

overriding goal was to remove barriers that were

11

preventing persons with disabilities from gaining access

12

to the economic and social mainstream of American life.

13

To that end, Congress catalogued on the face of the

14

statute a number of practices that it thought was impeding

15

that access, and it called these -- and this is a quote

16

from the statute -- forms of discrimination.

17

First on the list was the isolation and

18

segregation of persons with disability from the social

19

mainstream of American life.

20

is clear that what Congress had in mind in putting that

21

first on the list and referring to institutionalization as

22

one of the places where there are serious and pervasive

23

problems to be addressed was the unnecessary confinement

24

of persons with mental disabilities.

QUESTION:

Pardon?

can say something to reassure me.

this, that in the APA brief, they say without de-

institutionalization there would be 800,000 people in

institutions, but there are only about 76,000.

7

of those 76,000 must really need to be in institutions.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

What bothers me is

Well, many

Yes.

And so, what worries me about your

10

position is writing something that, as it really works out

11

in the world, leads a lot of the people who need to be in

12

institutions to be out, abandoned in the streets.

13

the reason that that is possible in my mind is because

14

once you say the law requires you to put people in halfway

15

houses, if you say that's appropriate, but appropriate is

16

a term that we want medical people to decide, not judges.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

Now,

Correct.

And so, I'm suddenly worried in areas

19

of uncertainty, like your clients here who have been in

21

others from time to time, and then sometimes -- that's the

in 10a of our appendix.

You have to read two regulations

together.

D is the basic integration obligation which

3

says that a public entity shall administer services,

4

programs, and activities in the most integrated setting

5

appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals.

6

then look above on number 7.

7

regulation, which says that a public entity shall make

8

reasonable modifications in policies and so on unless it's

9

a fundamental alteration.

But

It is subject to that

And what that regulation reflects is that it has

10

11

never been the case under section 504 or the ADA that in

12

order to comply with them, a State would have to make

13

fundamental alterations or unreasonable changes in policy.

14

That was clear under this Court's decision in Southeastern

15

Community College v. Davis and in Alexander v. Choate, and

16

this regulation carries that principle over.

to create them, although many people would be better

That would depend on whether

housing, but with limited staff to serve a number of

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

One-on-one care strikes us as an

issue that ought to be resolved in light of whether it is
