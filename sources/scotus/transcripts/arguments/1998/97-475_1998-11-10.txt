MS. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here today requesting the Court to hold

11

12

known as the Warsaw Convention, exclusively governs

13

recovery for passenger injury sustained in the course of

14

international air carriage.

18

damages as a result of being subjected to a security

20

safety and security of international air transportation.

The legal issue before the Court, however, is

22

not confined to the issue presented in her case.

24

to the Warsaw Convention.

this was not an accident.

MS. WILSON:

QUESTION:

5

The court below found that
Is that right?

Yes, Your Honor.
And we take the case on that

assumption.

6

MS. WILSON:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And there is an article in the

8

convention setting aside limits of liability in the case

9

of willful misconduct, but we don't have that issue before

10
11

us in this case?
MS. WILSON:

I would submit, Justice O'Connor,

12

you do not because the trial court found that there was no

13

willful misconduct in the facts of this case, and that

14

finding was not disturbed by the court of appeals, and

15

therefore I do not believe it is before the Court.

16

QUESTION:

And if there were a case of willful

17

misconduct, then there -- there would be no limit on the

18

liability, or you would look to the law of the nation

19

trying the case to determine that liability?

20

MS. WILSON:

Justice O'Connor, we would submit

21

that you do not reach the issue of willful misconduct if

22

you do not reach the threshold issue of meeting the

23

conditions under article 17.

24

intended to be read outside of the convention.

were to do so, then you would be not reading into the

So, in any event in this case, we

would bear on it.
MS. WILSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

to address that in this case.

5

QUESTION:

There's no reason

Except that under your

6

interpretation, we are left with the -- with the surely

7

unusual situation in which if there is a willful tort

8

committed by a carrier, so long as it is not an accident,

9

there is no recovery.

20

MS. WILSON:

21

QUESTION:

That's -- extraordinary.
Well, it -Isn't that right?

I mean, isn't that

22

the consequence of -- of the interpretation you're giving

23

to the - - to the treaty?

1

you're not entitled to recover under the convention.
QUESTION:

2

3
4

that?

Why would anyone write a treaty like

I mean -MS. WILSON:

Well, at the time that the

5

convention was drafted, it was 1929.

The carriers were

6

free to disclaim any and all liability, and it was a

7

compromise to have the liability that was created under

8

the convention to be limited except for in the

9

circumstances provided for.

So, if you allow the

10

passengers to seek unlimited recovery outside the

11

convention, you're creating an incentive for them to try

12

and prove there isn't an accident so that when they don't

13

have bodily injury, they can seek unlimited damages.

14

QUESTION:

But that still doesn't seem to me a

15

good explanation for why the convention would cover

16

accidents that really were no fault of the carrier and

17

exclude liability for something that's intentional

18

wrongdoing on the part of the carrier.

19

MS. WILSON:

Well, they -- I don't believe the

20

drafters thought they were doing that because when they

21

drafted the convention, they also had article 20 which was

22

the all necessary measures defense.

23

that fly into and out of the United States are not

24

entitled to avail themselves of the all necessary measures

25

defense, that's where the fault issue really came into

Although carriers

1

play.

It was the unusual, unexpected occurrence as

2

defined by Saks which would determine whether you have the

3

accident requirement, and even if you did, if the carrier

4

was able to establish that it had taken all reasonable

5

measures that it could take, it wouldn't be liable.

6

if -- it was only if you weren't able to establish that

7

burden as the carrier, then you would have limited

8

liability.
QUESTION:

9

And

Why isn't it just as fair a reading

10

-- and granted, article 25 is not before us in this case,

11

but when we're construing the convention as a whole, we

12

have to have some mind for the type of thing article 25

13

covers -- just as fair a reading of article 25 to say that

14

the convention does permit recovery, but the limits are

15

off?

16

MS. WILSON:

To do that, I believe you have to

17

ignore the scheme as to how the articles under the

18

liability chapter were set forth.

19

QUESTION:

Ms. Wilson, it might help if you gave

20

examples of what has been considered willful misconduct.

21

A very recent example is the KAL case; that is, it is an

22

accident, but the conduct was found by a jury to be -- to

23

amount to willful misconduct.

24

cases that have come up under the convention involving

25

willful misconduct have been categorized as accidents, and

So, as far as I know, the

1

then the question is, if the conduct was so egregious, the

2

limits on liability are off.
Is there any case of willful misconduct other

3
4

than the KAL pattern?

5

MS. WILSON:

Well, there are the willful

6

misconduct instances with respect to, for example, the Pan

7

Am Lockerbie bombing.

9

willful misconduct, although it clearly was intentional

program or the lack thereof.

13

The willful misconduct on the part of the

And there are other instances in which the - -

14

there have been terrorist attacks or hijackings in which

15

the carriers are found to be responsible in damages, but

16

they're not held to the level of willful misconduct.

17

And, therefore, the limit of the passengers is the limit

18

that is applicable.

19

QUESTION:

In the Lockerbie situation, would the

20

-- would the carrier's -- let's say it is willful --

21

failure to -- to have adequate security measures -- would

22

that be considered an accident so that you could come

23

under the treaty?

8

unexpected event of having the bomb placed on the

9

aircraft, but the conduct of the carrier that rose to the

10

level of intentional, the willful misconduct on the part

11

of the carrier, was their security program.

No.

the Lockerbie decision rested more on the fact that Pan Am

MS. WILSON:

In fact, you could say they

providing.

Do I understand that from your point

of view it doesn't matter?

this case because you need to meet both conditions in

2

order to recover under the convention, and it was

3

undisputed by the respondent that plaintiff did not

4

sustain a bodily injury and that she was in the course of

5

embarkation.

6

insofar as the respondent was concerned when he appealed

7

or, I should say, Ms. Tseng appealed to the Second Circuit

8

was whether the court was incorrect in finding that the

9

search constituted an accident.

So, the only issue that ended up going up

But for us to bring it up to this level, it's

10

11

the -- it's the broader issue of whether or not the treaty

12

is exclusive, and if you don't meet both conditions, you

don't have a right to recovery.

case, you didn't have to reach the accident issue because

15

she didn't have bodily injury.

QUESTION:

17

And in this particular

I suppose we ought to let you address

this case.

(Laughter.)

19

MS. WILSON:

20

The - - the court did not have squarely before

21

it, until this case, the question of exclusivity, but we

22

believe that the Franklin Mint, Saks, Chan, Floyd, and

23

Zicherman decisions nevertheless issued a -- a line of

24

cases which should have directed the lower court to find

25

that the convention is exclusive.

In Franklin Mint, the Court recognized the dual

1

2

purposes of the convention, which were to create a uniform

3

body of aviation law and to limit the carrier's

4

presumptive liability.
In Saks, the Court broadly defined what

5
6

constitutes an accident contemplated by article 17 and

7

held that the carrier is liable to a passenger only if the

8

passenger proves there was an accident that was the cause

9

of the injury.
Then in Chan, the Court enforced the limited

10
11

liability created by the drafters and looked to the

12

parallel notice provisions with respect to baggage and

13

cargo to interpret the notice provision for the passenger

14

tickets.

15

In Floyd, the Court enforced the article 17

16

bodily injury requirement holding that the carrier cannot

17

be held liable under 17 unless the accident has caused

18

bodily injury.

19

In Zicherman, the Court gave the most natural

20

reading of article 24 and held that in an action brought

21

under article 17, article 24 directs the lower court to

22

look to local law to determine the measure of the

23

passenger's recovery and who may bring a suit.

24

We contend that in this case that the Court once

25

again needs to interpret the convention as a whole and not

4

and if you read the scheme in terms of the chapter 3

entitled to limited -- to limited recovery if the

8

passenger met the conditions under article 17.

The carrier has created a clear scheme of

But is -- do I correctly understand

10

that your position is that it does not matter whether this

11

is a case covered by article 17 or not?

13

international travel, and that's the end of the ball game

14

unless there's recovery under article 17.

MS. WILSON:

All you have to

16

with that position because I do not view article 17 as

QUESTION:

No, but article 17 surely is relevant

22

it's not relevant?

25

well, the first thing I've got to decide is whether or not

Because article 24(2) says, in - -

it's covered by article 17, and I think you're saying it

2

doesn't really make any difference whether it's covered by

3

17.
MS. WILSON:

4

Well, I -- I don't in the sense

5

that I say covered by 17 means that they concern passenger

6

injury or death cases, not that it concerns whether or not

7

you have a recoverable claim under article 17.
QUESTION:

Well, I still -- I'm still not sure.

Do you think it makes any difference in -- to your case

MS. WILSON:

12

And if

It is a passenger injury case, and

13

therefore it falls under article 17, but the passenger in

14

this instance does not state a recoverable claim under 17.

QUESTION:

Are you saying it's covered by 17

It covers the universe and -- and in

I would say the passenger simply cannot

QUESTION:

See, the problem I have, this is - - I

13

want to get it on the table so you have an opportunity to

16

article 17 which describes the universe of cases in which

17

the carrier shall be liable.

18

article 17 also covers cases in which the -- the carrier

19

shall not be liable.

20

MS. WILSON:

But you're suggesting

I do suggest that, Your Honor,

because I suggest that article 1 is intended to provide

MR. SILK:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And that's all it meant.

And if you

5

don't read it that way, you get into a terrible mess.

You

6

get into the mess, for example, that a flight attendant

7

who hits somebody in the face and she says it was an

accident or the -- the passenger says, no, no, she did it

on purpose, or -- or you have somebody suing in a State

MR. SILK:

My view on the Abnett case, or the

12

that we have in this case.

14

it wants with respect to the kind of cases that they were

totally different from the fact problem before this Court.

do you have anything else, and I said, yes, I have
psychiatric testimony to put on to show psychiatric injury
and causal relationship and so on and so forth.

And the

trial judge said, you don't need to do it because if the
only problem is psychic, it's being dismissed under Floyd.
And I said, but -- and I argued there that -that this was not an accident and Floyd applies only to
accidents under article 17, and the judge said, yes, it

There was a New Zealand case --

I think so.

Incidentally,

MR. SILK:

Right, but by article 18 and 19.

QUESTION:

Right, but the same issue would

Justice O'Connor suggests, say that it means the latter.

Its whole focus is liability.

Its focus is not just passengers.

What about 18?

Does 18 begin the

MR. SILK:

I believe it does then, overhearing

QUESTION:

Well, it does but the difference in

17 and 18 is 18 doesn't refer to an accident.

It refers to an occurrence.

MR. SILK:

And it's much broader, and it would

QUESTION:

Which, it seems to me, helps you.

MR. SILK:

If that word were included in article

5

17, it would -- it would hurt me because article 17 would

6

be - - would -- would say that -- that -- if it was an

7

occurrence, it would fall under article 17, and if it fell

under article -- if article 17 used the word occurrence,

this event would have fallen under article 17.

therefore it would have been precluded by article 24 too.

It would have been precluded.

The question is whether it's

MR. SILK:

I -- I believe so because the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DIANE W. WILSON

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WILSON:

20
21

Your Honors, I would just like to

make two brief points.
One is that the court below specifically found

22

23

that there was no willful misconduct in this case, and

24

that's referenced at page 27 of the appendix to the

25

petition.

And also that accident can encompass intentional

1

2

torts.

3

you have willful misconduct that you get an unlimited

4

recovery.

5

That's what article 25 can look to.

It is only if

Accident wasn't ever meant to mean unintended.
I also would note that you should meet the terms

6

and conditions of article 25.

You have to meet the terms

7

and conditions of article 24.

There is a symmetry there.

8

9

And with respect to the issue of article 18, I
believe that the fact that the liability is broader in

10

scope with respect to baggage and cargo should not mean

11

that if -- where you have a narrower scope of liability

12

under the convention, you then get to get recovery outside

13

of the convention.

14

Thank you.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

16
