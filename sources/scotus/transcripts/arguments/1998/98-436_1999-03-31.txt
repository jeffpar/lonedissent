Mr. Gold.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question in this case, which we have

10
11

referred to in our briefs as the Article I State sovereign

12

immunity question, is generated by and can only be

13

answered by reference to the unique sovereignty scheme of

14

our Constitution.

15

the United States and the States, subdivides the sovereign

16

authority of the United States among the three branches of

17

the National Government, makes the sovereign legislative

18

authority of the United States within its sphere supreme,

19

and provides a dual role for the State courts in the

20

enforcement of the entire law, both Federal and State.

That scheme divides sovereignty between

The question here is predicated on the following

21
22

case.

After their Federal court Fair Labor Standards Act

23

overtime pay case was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment

24

grounds and as specifically provided for in the FLSA, the

25

State employee plaintiffs here began this proceeding by

bringing an FLSA case against the State of Maine in the

2

Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine.

3

Maine in its answer answered entered an

4

affirmative defense of sovereign immunity.

5

court granted Maine's motion for judgment on that defense,

6

and the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in a 4 to 2

7

decision affirmed.

8

9

The superior

In this Court, Maine's submission in defending
the decision below is that the FLSA provision for State

10

employee overtime pay suits against a State in State court

11

is not a valid law because it transgresses a

12

constitutional constraint on Congress' Article I

13

legislative power, one that puts it beyond Congress'

14

authority to provide for the enforcement of a valid

15

Federal statute through State liability rules that

16

override State sovereign immunity rules.

17

The framework for the issue presented is

18

provided by this Court's Garcia decision and its decision

19

in Howlett v. Rose.

20

QUESTION:

21
22

As to Garcia -Howlett was not a suit against a

State, was it, Mr. Gold?
MR. GOLD:

No.

It was a suit against a

23

municipality, and all we argue is that its method of

24

approach frames the question.

25

becomes the one that the State raises whether a suit

Then the ultimate question

1

against a State where the State claims sovereign immunity

2

is in a different category or class than a suit against a

3

municipality where the municipality claims State sovereign

4

immunity.
And that question turns on -- not on the

5
6

analytic structure of Howlett, which would treat both the

7

same, but as the State recognizes, on whether State

8

sovereign immunity, when claimed by the State, is of a

9

different and constitutional dimension, a dimension which

10

would make the Federal law invalid and thereby -QUESTION:

11

Well, how -- how is that so?

I

12

thought in Seminole Tribe we described other ways of

13

enforcing a Federal law, even though it couldn't be done

14

directly.

15

enforcement of the Federal law at stake.

16

I suppose there are alternative means of

MR. GOLD:

There -- if Congress cannot provide

17

for private party State court enforcement of this law,

18

given the Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence which

19

also closes the Federal courts to such proceedings --

20

QUESTION:

Well, but I suppose that a private

21

person could still sue a State officer under an Ex parte

22

Young type approach.

23

MR. GOLD:

That could be done, but it would not

24

be a suit for back pay for the money due and owing, and

25

therefore what you have is if State sovereign immunity is

1

an absolute check on the sovereign powers of Congress,

2

then there can be no private party enforcement of a valid,

3

binding Federal enactment.

4

QUESTION:

But I --

5

QUESTION:

So that the private party can prevent

6

any future violation of the Federal law, and I assume the

7

United States, if it -- if it wished, if the statute were

8

framed that way, could sue on behalf of the people who had

9

been deprived previously of what they were entitled to

10

under the Federal law.
MR. GOLD:

11

Yes, and the -- the State does

12

concede that, and indeed as this Court has made clear, so

13

that we're not overstating anything, the suit by the

14

United States could be in Federal court as well as in

15

State court.

There is no bar to that.

16

But the question is whether Congress is

17

constrained by some constitutional principle from

18

providing that which the sovereign can normally provide

19

for enforcement through the usual processes of the law by

20

the right holder in the law created by the sovereign.
QUESTION:

21
22

Well, it is a constitutional

principle.

23

Mr. Gold, one -- I just can't conceive of the

24

Constitution being ratified if it were thought that the

25

States could be sued as States in their own courts, and to

that extent, I understand the Eleventh Amendment as being

2

confirmatory of the original understanding.

3

it's an amendment, and we know that amendments are done to

4

change the original understanding.

5

think it was the original understanding and that's what

6

puzzles me in this case.

7
8

Of course,

But in this case I

And of course, we know the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment made a dividing line
and federalism for those actions were changed.

But this

10

isn't under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment, and

11

it comes back to this basic constitutional principle which

12

I think teaches something, maybe not very much if the

13

Federal Government can, in effect, get around our opinion

14

by withholding grants in aid or suing on its own.

15

seems -- I have -- I have trouble conceiving of the

16

Constitution being ratified under your theory.

17

MR. GOLD:

But it

Well, if -- if I can, Justice

18

Kennedy, it seems to me that what we see with regard to

1

the original understanding is two points, and I don't

20

think they lead to the conclusion that there is some

21

implicit constitutional limit on Congress' sovereign

22

authority that runs in favor -- that limits Congress in

23

its sovereign power and runs in favor of the States as to

24

a matter where the State isn't sovereign.

25

I don't want to engage in word play, but what

1

the claim is here, that there is something never seen

2

before, namely, a limit on a true sovereign in favor of a

3

--an entity who is certainly a governing authority and an

4

important governing authority and a sovereign in many

5

regards, but runs in favor of that governing entity in an

6

aspect of the overall scheme in which the State or that

7

governing entity is not sovereign.

extraordinary notion, one which we would think had to have

9

some express understanding, and it's quite different from

That is a wholly

10

the concerns and interests that animated what we know of

11

the fidelity to State sovereign immunity.

12

QUESTION:

But, you know, you say it's an

13

extraordinary notion, but the whole -- the whole system of

14

--of dual sovereignty and dual citizenship was an

15

extraordinary notion.

16

MR. GOLD:

I mean, it is extraordinary.
Right, but -- and as the Eleventh

17

Amendment shows, in making adjustments to deal with the

18

new aspects of that extraordinary situation, there was

19

what I think would have to be seen as an entirely new

20

concept adjusted to the situation to preserve a form of -

21

- or to create a form of State sovereign immunity which

22

would not have obtained by simple extrapolation from the

23

law of nations.

And that's the Eleventh Amendment.

QUESTION:

As Justice Kennedy pointed out, the

Eleventh Amendment -- our case law has said -- and I

understand there's some argument about it, but -- but it's

sovereign immunity that existed.

10

And in fact, it hasn't had its hands tied.

It

and I think it's significant that, you know, it's been 200

13

and -- and what -- some odd years before -- before this

14

issue has even come before us.

Government hasn't found it very needful to proceed in this

fashion in order to achieve its -- its necessary

obj ectives.

MR. GOLD:

Apparently the Federal

Well, as time evolves and we

understand more about what's needed, I would argue to you

that that kind of judgment is precisely the kind of

judgment that Congress makes, what is proper enforcement,

QUESTION:

-- and excluded the State from those

areas.

Therefore, anything goes.
MR. GOLD:

The -- first of all, for sovereign

5

immunity, it has to be a suit against the State on a

6

Federal law which is valid within the State sovereignty

7

constraints on Federal law, and nothing we say here goes

8

to the special case of the Eleventh Amendment, which is,

9

as this Court has been careful to state, a restriction on

10

the Federal judicial power borne of particular concerns

11

about the Federal judicial power, not a constraint on the

12

sovereign legislative power.

13

In Seminole -- if I could, and then I will try

14

to save the rest of my time -- the Court did not say that

15

Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity is a limit on

16

Congress' plenary law enforcement powers.

17

a very careful holding was that State sovereign immunity,

18

as a limit on the Federal judicial power, that separation

19

of powers concepts prevent the legislative branch from

20

expanding the heads of Federal jurisdiction.

21

therefore, Congress cannot provide for suits in Federal

22

court that are beyond the Federal judicial power.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR

8

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the Founders adopted the Constitution, they

11

conferred the Article I powers upon Congress immediately,

12

but they left it optional whether Federal -- lower Federal

13

courts would be -- ever be created.

14

expect that the Article I powers would be effectuated?

15

So, how did they

The answer is provided by the text of the

16

Supremacy Clause, which makes the Constitution and laws of

17

the United States the supreme law of the land and provides

18

that, quote, the Judges in every State shall be bound

19

thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any

20

State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

21

In the context of the document as a whole, this

22

must include authority for Congress to provide remedies in

23

State courts, otherwise the great Article I powers would

24

have been written in disappearing ink.

25

The State relies in this case on an asserted

1

constitutional or pre-constitutional right of sovereign

2

immunity in its own courts.

3

explained for this unanimous Court in 1907, sovereignty

4

belongs to, quote, the authority that makes the law upon

5

which the right depends.

6

the sovereign is not the State.

7

therefore, as this Court explained in Hilton, when a

8

Federal statute imposes liability upon the States, quote,

9

the Supremacy Clause makes that law the law in every State

10
11

But as Justice Holmes

With respect to Federal claims,
It is the Nation, and

enforceable fully in State court.
QUESTION:

Well, General Waxman, would you agree

12

that there is no case from our Court that squarely decides

13

the issue before us now?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

I would agree that no case squarely

15

decides it.

16

Arkansas in its analysis of this very question that this

17

Court's decisions in Hilton and Howlett, particularly

18

taken together, very strongly suggest the result.

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Howlett didn't involve a State.
No.

Howlett didn't involve a

21

State, but it did -- Howlett stands for the proposition

22

that when the State, on behalf of a -- an arm of the

23

State, an entity that isn't -- that is subject to

24

liability under the Federal statute --we know that States

25

aren't subject to liability -- are assertedly covered by a

State assertion of sovereign immunity -- the Supremacy

It seems to me by analogy you would

think you read too much into Howlett.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it may be.

I -- I would

13

suggest that Howlett itself announced two principles that

14

we think are quite fundamental to this case and,

15

understood in the context of this Court's decision in

16

Hilton, I think strongly suggest the result.

17

principles are, number one, that a State court may not

18

deny a Federal right absent a valid excuse.

two, that an excuse that is inconsistent with or violates

20

Federal law is not a valid excuse.

Now, in Hilton, this Court considered the

applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act, whether the

court.
And the State argued in its brief and before

2

3

this Court that because the State was entitled to a

4

sovereign immunity in its own courts of a constitutional

5

significance equal to the Eleventh Amendment, the

6

unmistakably clear principle of Atascadero and Welch had

7

to be applied and therefore the State remedy wasn't

8

available.

9

And this Court rejected that proposition over a

strong dissent that adopted the State's argument, and the

11

majority opinion held that, no,

13

is the -- is the requirement in Pennhurst and Gregory v.

15

we don't have to apply that pure statutory construction

rule of statutory construction, that is, stare decisis,

the question -- the clear

And

19

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you are quite right that

20

this Court's decision in Hilton doesn't decide the precise

21

question that's before this Court, but I suggest to the

22

Court, most respectfully,

23

about the consequence of denying a right in State court

24

against the -- the Eleventh Amendment backdrop in which no

25

right would be available in Federal court, would be that

1

the plaintiffs would be denied a right at all, and it

2

would have been I think -- I suggest -- rather surprising

3

to the Court to understand that there was some sovereign

4

immunity principle in State court that could trump that

5

concern.

6

QUESTION:

Well, the Hilton court respected

7

stare decisis in part, the reasoning of which has been

8

totally undercut by our later cases.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, what I think -- I think it's

10

-- it's quite significant, Mr. Chief Justice, that the way

11

this Court concluded its opinion in Howlett was to say,

12

quote, that when a Federal statute does impose liability

13

upon the States -- I'm sorry.

14

Clause makes that law the law in every State fully

15

enforceable in State court, and it cited as support for

16

that proposition the Court's unanimous decision the term

17

before in Howlett.

18

Hilton -- the Supremacy

And I suggest that that strongly implies that

19

what the Court concluded was that if the State had, as it

20

claimed it had, a sovereign immunity of constitutional

21

significance, this Court would have been required under

22

its prior decisions to apply the constitutional rule of -

- of utterly clear statement.

1

I -- I think we -- we can take for

2

purposes of argument here there's little doubt that

Congress can pass this -- this statute.

does it follow that it can prescribe any conceivable

In this case, the Government could sue.

Why

didn't the Government bring a suit in this case?

9

I authority, I don't think that the States have a

10

sovereign immunity in their own court -- and this goes to

11

Justice Scalia's question -- for two fundamental reasons.

12

This Court explained in Nevada v. Hall,

13

referring back to Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, the

14

proposition that there are -- that the notion of sovereign

15

immunity is really an amalgam of two different types of

16

sovereign immunity.

17

the doctrine of sovereign immunity is an amalgam of two

18

quite different concepts:

19

sovereign's own courts and the other two suits in the

20

courts of another sovereign.

21

latter was always a matter of comity, always until the

22

Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution.

23

for this is the nature of sovereignty.

24

sovereignty is the right to make the substantive law upon

25

which the right depends.

1

Now, with respect to suits in their own courts,

2

which was not the issue in Nevada v. Hall and which is not

3

the issue in any of this Court's Eleventh Amendment cases

4

-- those are all suits about the other kind of sovereignty

5

which doesn't depend on the sovereign being the law giver

6

and which were always a matter of comity until, in the

7

Plan of Convention, it was made absolute by a constriction

8

or an interpretation of the scope of Article III.

9

With respect to the former type of sovereignty,

10

which is at issue in this case, there was a principle in

11

effect at the time the Constitution was decided that

12

States were sovereign, absolutely sovereign, against suits

13

against themselves in their own courts.

QUESTION:

MR. BRANN:

Could you explain that to me?
We think that the States -- one of

the key aspects of sovereignty is the ability to create

10

11

the Framers was that when we came to the Constitution,

12

that the States were immune since time immemorial in their

13

own courts.

14

we may very well have given up the -- to the United States

15

the ability to sue us in Federal court as part of the Plan

21

of State sovereignty to be immune in its own courts, but

22

it was an equally fundamental aspect of State sovereignty

So that if the Congress concededly can take away

Oh, I can -- I'll grant you that you

have conceded that.
But the basic problem that both Justice Stevens
and I, I think, are having is -- is a problem of finding a
coherent theory because if the -- if the theory behind
your case is sovereign immunity, then I think it's pretty
clear that there is not going to be any exception for
enforcement actions by the National Government even in its
own courts.
If, on the other hand, your -- your theory is - is a principle which somehow is reflective of the
Eleventh Amendment, it's clear the Eleventh Amendment
doesn't apply to State actions.
And we're left, if we eliminate those two
possibilities, with essentially the Supremacy Clause
argument, and -- and because the Supremacy Clause makes it
clear beyond any argument that, within the proper sphere
of Article I, the State no longer has a sovereignty to
assert as against a Federal law, then it just seems kind
of a bizarre exception to say, but that doesn't apply when
the -- when the Congress decides who it is who will walk
win the courthouse door to enforce the law.

What am I missing?

MR. BRANN:

3

I

Let me take my best attempt to

4

provide that theory -- is that we granted to Congress the

5

power to regulate commerce among the several States.

6

there's no doubt that one of the motivating factors were

7

the tariffs and the trade wars and the like, and we gave

8

up that.

9

that commerce under those circumstances.

And

The States gave that up, that you can regulate

We -- then we asked ourselves, but did they also

10
11

give up the right for Congress to pass a law that then

gave a private individual the right to bring a damages

QUESTION:

14

And it seems to me that the answer to

15

that question turns on what the commerce power today

16

includes.

17

Framers would have been very surprised by the Garcia

decision.

19

to extend, in fact, to the -- to the limit that it has

because they couldn't foresee the growth of commerce.

once the Framers had seen that the commerce power goes

this far, then I don't see that there's much argument left

no theory of sovereign immunity in the 18th century that

included an exception for the United States.

that, that takes us back to the Framers.

And when we do

And then we think that it's relevant that the -

- in the -- if we remember the Madisonian Compromise in

QUESTION:

Well, and insofar as there is a

perceived incongruity in your concession that the United

that one State can sue another State, and so it surely

MR. BRANN:

And the -- but the debate over

Article III only becomes critical at the moment that -- if

you start with the premise that you couldn't file suit in

the State courts which, as we recall, were going to

constitute the vast majority of the courts that existed -

- and so the fact that there is no one, federalist or

suggesting that one of the consequences of a -- of a -- of

ratifying the Constitution is giving up that sovereign

QUESTION:

If we could go back to the -- get

down from the lofty Madisonian plane to the practical

That is certainly -Some people think sovereign immunity

shouldn't exist for that very reason.

MR. BRANN:

In other words, why is it more important to you

It seems that if you prevail, we're

So, what I don't see is, is it clear in the

was the original bargain, if you will, when the States

were -- although we were giving up our rights, if you

the Federal Government passing Federal statutes, which are

- and indeed, it did not.

There's no one who suggested it

10

11

certainly in a State's own court.

14

You -- you mentioned a moment ago in -- in the

concern about bringing common law actions, e.g., actions

MR. BRANN:

abrogation?

And if you had asked that question at the

course, not.

12

That's ridiculous.

It's not ridiculous today, and the question is,
