CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument

now in Number 97-1184, the National Federation of Federal

5

Employees v. The Department of the Interior, and a

6

companion case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. SMITH

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the Federal Labor Relations

13

Authority's interpretation of its own organic statute.

14

The Authority has concluded that the Federal Service

15

Labor-Management Relations statute obligates an agency to

16

bargain over union-initiated proposals offered during the

17

term of a collective bargaining agreement.

18

QUESTION:

Didn't the agency at one time have a

19

different position and then changed its position just as a

20

result of the decision of the Court of Appeals of the

21

District of Columbia Circuit?

22

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, the Federal Labor

23

Relations Authority indeed did originally come down on the

24

opposite side of this question in its IRS I decision.

25

However, subsequent to the reversal by the Court

1

of Appeals for the District of Columbia the Authority

2

reevaluated the issue and changed its mind, and decided

3

that the statute did, in fact, obligate the agency to

4

bargain.
QUESTION:

5
6

How much choice did it have in the

light of the court of appeals decision?
MR. SMITH:

7

The Authority has in several cases,

8

Your Honor, chosen to nonacquiesce in a court of appeals

9

decision with which it disagreed.
We cite in brief cases where we've done this

10
11

when we disagreed, so the Authority could have, given the

12

multiple venue provisions of our statute, have chosen not

13

to have followed the Court of Appeals for the District of

14

Columbia's decision in this case, but did, in fact,

15

reconsider its original position and decide that the D.C.

16

Circuit was, in fact, correct.

17

QUESTION:

Are the terms and the substance of

18

the reconsideration set forth on remand from the agency in

19

the IRS case?
Has the agency issued any other adjudicative

20
21

dispositions or any rules to indicate that it continues to

22

adhere to this position and to add to its reasoning in any

23

respect?

24
25

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, the Authority

has, on numerous occasions, subsequent to its IRS II

1

decision in

987, adhered to the position it took in IRS

2

II and determined that mid-term collective bargaining is

3

required under the statute.
The Authority said originally in the case on

4
5

remand from the District of Columbia that it had

6

reconsidered the issue and thought the District of

7

Columbia Court of Appeals was correct and, despite several

8

reversals by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the

9

Authority has stuck to its position.

10

been our position since
QUESTION:

11
12

This has, in fact,

987.

Mr. Smith, you're here representing

the Authority which is, as I recollect, three individuals,

3

no more than two of whom can be from the same political

4

party, appointed for 5 years and not removable except for

5

cause.

6

MR. SMITH:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And also appearing is -- in today's

8

argument is the Solicitor General, who, I suppose, is

9

appearing on behalf of the President of the United States.

20
21
22

MR. SMITH:

Well, he will, of course, tell you

on whose behalf he is appearing.
QUESTION:

I appear on behalf of --

Well, so we have a disagreement

23

between these three individuals and the President of the

24

United States regarding a statute that goes to the

25

internal management of the personnel of the executive

branch.

2

here?

Is that a fair description of what's going on

MR. SMITH:

3
4

differently.

The agencies of Government have a view --

QUESTION:

5

I think we interpret the statute

And you want us to give deference to

6

these three members of the Federal Labor Relations.

7

Authority in preference to the views of the President of

8

the United States as to what the efficient management of

9

the personnel of the executive branch requires?
MR. SMITH:

10
11

Well,

there are several points

raised there, Justice Scalia.
We don't think deference is required in this

12

3

case because we think the statute is clear that there is

4

an obligation to bargain midterm.
If you think it unclear, yes, we would seek

5
6

deference in this case.

7

The Congress,

of course, passed the Federal

8

Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.

9

signed by a President we are,

in effect,

While it was

carrying out the

20

will of the Congress, not necessarily the will of the

21

President,

22

relations.

23

in what we do vis-a-vis Federal sector labor

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, how could it be the will

24

of the Executive,

25

adversary in all the proceedings that are before the FLRA,

since the Executive is always an

1

so Congress set you up to be an arbiter between the unions

2

and the Federal Executive.
MR. SMITH:

3

That is, of course, correct, Justice

4

Ginsburg, and on the several occasions when we've had the

5

privilege of being before the Court before, we are

6

virtually always in opposition with agencies on -QUESTION:

7

9

arbiter.

I'm not questioning whether you're an

Of course you are.
But the question is, do you come here with some

10

assumption of validity of what you have done in the narrow

11

situation where what is at issue is the internal

12

management of the personnel of the executive branch, and

13

the President has chosen to disagree with you to such a

14

degree that he's willing to go to court about it?

15

I mean, initially, very often two agencies of

16

the Government disagree, and that is usually resolved

17

internally, but here we have two agencies disagreeing, and

18

they've come to the Court and asked us to settle it and

19

the question -- it's a very narrow question I'm asking.

20

In settling this particular question, do you

21

really think we -- it fits our scheme of Government to

22

give deference to these three individuals, never elected

23

by anyone, appointed without removal power by the

24

President, over the views of the President, and I have

25

serious doubts whether it's proper to give deference in

1

that situation.
MR. SMITH:

2

Justice Scalia,

I would only point

3

out that the members of the Authority are on a quasiÂ­

4

independent body.
As you noted in your question to me earlier,

5
6

they are appointed by the President,

7

Congress,

8

cause,

QUESTION:

But Congress is not free to create

any scheme of things it wishes.
I mean, maybe Congress does want that scheme of

11

12

and can only be removed by the Congress for good

so the President in the scheme of things --

9
10

confirmed by the

things and does not want the President to be in control of

3

the personnel of the executive branch, but I -- that's

4

just not the way I read the Constitution.

5

MR. SMITH:

Well, at the end of the day,

6

Congress'

7

Federal sector employees have when they bargain

8

collectively under the statute, and if it is that we read

9

the statute different from the agencies of Government,

20

statute has articulated several rights that

be it.
QUESTION:

21

Maybe the Pendleton Act, passed back

22

in

23

anything to regulate the way the Executive deals with

24

Federal employees.

25

so

983, was unconstitutional,

MR. SMITH:

Well,

if Congress can't do

clearly Congress can,

Mr. Chief Justice, do things to regulate the way the

2

Executive deals with its employees.
QUESTION:

3

We've --

Well, it can tell them, as the

4

Pendleton Act did, just what the President must do, but it

5

can't tell the President to obey somebody else as to how

6

he should treat Federal employees.

7

question?

8

9

MR. SMITH:

Isn't that a different

Perhaps it is, but we are at this

point reevaluating some 20 years of judicial review of

10

Authority decisions, and disagreements between the Federal

11

Labor Relations Authority and agencies of Government over

12

what the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations

13

Statute requires are not rare.

14

QUESTION:

They're commonplace.

Mr. Smith, tell me a little about the

15

practicalities of this situation.

16

saying that midterm bargaining is allowable, how often has

17

that been sought in the jurisdiction of the District of

18

Columbia by unions with Federal employees?

19

MR. SMITH:

Since the CADC decision

In point of fact, one of the points

20

we make, Justice O'Connor, is it's very seldom come up.

21

The basis upon which the Authority originally thought that

22

there was no right to engage in midterm bargaining, and

23

upon which the Fourth Circuit specifically concluded that

24

there's no right to engage in midterm bargaining, was that

25

this would cause enormous disruption to the Government, it

would lead to inefficiencies, and all the rest.
Well, we're here after 11 years of midterm

2

3

bargaining being the law of the land in every court of

4

appeals in this country except the Fourth, and there are

5

no problems.

6

controversies.

There are no cases.

QUESTION:

7

We've had no

Well, have there been requests by the

8

unions for midterm bargaining?

9

MR. SMITH:

Yes, there have.

10

QUESTION:

And -- frequently?

11

MR. SMITH:

Well, yes, there have, but to a

12

certain extent we're in the complaint business.

13

know when there's a request to engage in midterm

14

bargaining and it goes down without a dispute, but what

15

comes to the attention of the Federal Labor Relations

16

Authority and the courts is when there is a disagreement

17

over whether or not there's an obligation to engage in

18

midterm bargaining, and there have been few disagreements

19

that have come forth.
QUESTION:

20

We don't

Well, because within the CADC you've

21

taken the position that it's okay, so it just goes

22

forward.

23
24
25

Do you know how often that these requests have
resulted in arbitration so that it's resolved?

1

brief are only five instances in some

2

have been disputes resolved by the Federal Service

3

Impasses Panel involving midterm bargaining, so they've

4

been rare indeed.

5

QUESTION:

2 years that there

This is a very curious proposal for

6

midterm bargaining, a provision that says, we have the

7

right to have midterm bargaining, isn't it?

8

a very curious provision that was sought after in this

9

case.

10

MR. SMITH:

I mean, it's

I don't know that I understand the

11

use of the word curious.

12

though, because as we point out the obligation and the

3

right to engage in midterm bargaining only pertains to

4

matters that are not contained in or covered by the

5

collective bargaining agreement, which of course is --

It's more limited than that,

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

9

I mean, I can understand a position that says

Where does that --- the rule in the private sector.
Where does that come from?

20

the FLRA has the power to decide when or whether midterm

21

bargaining should exist and what sorts, but you're saying

22

it doesn't have the power, that even if it thinks midterm

23

bargaining is terrible, it has to allow it because of the

24

statute, so if that's so, then why can't they reopen in

25

the middle of the term every closed agreement?

MR. SMITH:

1

Justice Breyer, the Authority reads

2

the statute as creating an obligation to engage in midterm

3

bargaining without limitation.

4

rule would not be appropriate, so we have developed and

5

applied the private sector rule to the Federal sector.
QUESTION:

6

However, we think that

Where -- if you're talking about

7

the -- your position differing from the Government I would

8

be repeating myself, but I don't see how you can read the

9

statute as you do, which is that it forces midterm

10

bargaining, it requires it.

11

it?
MR. SMITH:

12

13

QUESTION:

It requires it at the request of the

MR. SMITH:

On matters that are not covered in

union.

16
17

If the union -- I want to be

clear --

14
15

That's your position, isn't

the collective bargaining agreement.

18

QUESTION:

Where does it say that in the

19

statute?

20

requires midterm bargaining, but by the way, only on

21

certain subjects, in a statute that says not a word about

22

midterm bargaining.

23

What I don't see is how you can say the statute

That's why I'm having trouble.

I'd like you to explain -- I can understand how

24

a statute could delegate to the agency the power to decide

25

whether and under what circumstances, et cetera, et

1

cetera, namely the SG's position, I think, basically.

2

MR. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
But I don't understand the position

4

that it would require midterm bargaining even if the

5

Authority were to say, midterm bargaining's the worst idea

6

we've ever heard of.

7

MR. SMITH:

It requires midterm bargaining

8

because there's a broad obligation in the statute to

9

bargain with no limitation on the time or circumstances

10

when bargaining is to occur.
QUESTION:

11

12

Okay, so in your view, if they come

in, the union, and they say, we signed an agreement 3

3

weeks ago, and it promised to say nothing for

4

but by the way, we want to reopen everything right today,

5

midterm, in your view, does the statute require that?
MR. SMITH:

6

0 years,

Absent the Authority's contained and

7

covered by policy which the Authority has adopted to place

8

reasonable constraints on midterm bargaining, it would.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Smith, I don't understand that,

20

because I thought that the -- that even the D.C. Circuit

21

had made it clear that you could have a zipper clause, so

22

as Justice Breyer phrased the question, the union could

23

say in the collective bargaining agreement we promise not

24

to ask for midterm bargaining during the term of this

25

contract.

1

So the answer to his question is the zipper

2

clause, but that would be something to bargain for, is

3

that not so?

4

MR. SMITH:

Certainly the agencies can bargain

5

for zipper clauses to put an end to any midterm

6

bargaining, and that could be a provision in a collective

7

bargaining agreement.

8

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Why couldn't the union come around in

midterm and say, by the way, we want to renegotiate the
zipper clause?
I mean, how can you lift yourself by your own
petard that way?

If the entire agreement is up for

3

midterm bargaining, why isn't the zipper clause up for

4

midterm bargaining?

5

MR. SMITH:

We don't start with the premise that

6

the entire agreement is up for midterm bargaining.

7

premise is, those portions of the agreement that are --

8

those matters that are not contained in the agreement can

9

be negotiated midterm.

20

QUESTION:

The

That was Justice Breyer's point.

I

21

don't know where you get that limitation from.

22

contained in the National Labor Relations Act, but it's

23

not contained in your legis -- I mean, there's a

24

significant difference between the two, and I would think,

25

if that difference meant anything, it would mean that

It's

1

everything is negotiable midterm if anything is negotiable

midterm.

MR. SMITH:

There are many broad divisions in

our statute that provide for basic rights without

limitation and without explanation.

6

responsibility, as this Court has recognized in

7

interpreting decisions of the National Labor Relations

8

Board, to fill in the gaps.

9

QUESTION:

It's the Authority's

Well, when you fill in the gaps on

10

the general question of the permissibility or perhaps the

11

obligatory nature of midterm bargaining, I assume that

12

what you're doing is interpreting, if I remember the

13

statute correctly you're interpreting the phrase,

14

reasonable in -- the word reasonable in reasonable times

15

as those times at which collective bargaining is

16

obligatory.

17

Am I right that you're saying, well, midterm

18

bargaining is a reasonable time?

19

interpreting, isn't it?

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Okay.

That's what you're

I --

Do you have a similar word

22

that you're interpreting when you come to the conclusion

23

that they are obliged to bargain on matters which are not

24

covered by the agreement but they in fact would be

25

precluded from bargaining on matters that are covered?

Is there a textual basis for it the way there is

1

2

on the time question?
MR. SMITH:

3
4

I don't think so.

I thought I'd

answered that question.
Absent the Authority's contained and covered by

5
6

doctrine, which of course is adopted from the private

7

sector, I think there would be no specific limitation on

8

the right to engage in midterm bargaining.
QUESTION:

9
10

May I ask you just a technical

question about the agency's position?
You say that midterm bargaining with respect to

11

12

a matter covered by the agreement would be barred.

13

think it's the position that a matter that the union had

14

raised and had failed to get an agreement on, in other

15

words which it had dropped in the initial collective

16

bargaining, would also be barred?

17

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

I

Is that correct?

That's correct.
What about a matter raised by the

19

governmental agency upon which nobody got any agreement in

20

the collective bargaining agreement?

21

as well?

22

MR. SMITH:

Would that be barred

It would, of course, depend on the

23

nature of the bargaining history and what transpired at

24

the bargaining table.

25

another concession, yes, it would be barred, but I'm

If it was dropped in exchange for

MR. O'DUDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to spend just a moment taking the Court

6

through a textual analysis here and explain how we get to

7

our conclusion that midterm bargaining is required by the

8

statute, and then I'd like to spend a moment, if I could,

9

talking about the practicalities in connection with

20

midterm bargaining.

21

The question was asked earlier, where is it in

22

the statute that provides for the FLRA's conclusion that

23

midterm bargaining is required.

24

the statute you see in section

25

that it imposes on the agencies and the unions the

obligation to engage in bargaining for the purpose of

2

arriving at a collective bargaining agreement.

3

Well, what does that mean?

I think the answer

4

to that is to be found in the statute's definition of a

5

collective bargaining agreement.

6

When you turn to that definition in 7103(a)(12),

7

what do you see?

bargaining agreement is an agreement entered into as the

definition.

You see that it says that a collective

It includes --

QUESTION:

Well, it's almost tautological, too,

12

that a collective bargaining agreement is the result of

13

collective bargaining.

14

MR. O'DUDEN:

That is the way Congress chose to

15

define it, though, in a very broad fashion without

16

qualification, without temporal limitation, and it

17

certainly did not choose to define that phrase as the

respondent wants this Court to redefine it, namely, to

mean only a basic, comprehensive agreement.

lot of statutes that delegate to the Authority questions

I'm saying the reason my question is

that's of course what the NTEU v. the FLRA case was about.

an opinion that says, these things are up to the

MR. O'DUDEN:

Absolutely.

-- sometimes, always -- yes, all

MR. O'DUDEN:

10

And of course it was just a couple

11

of years ago in the Fort Stewart case where this Court

12

recognized that it was the Authority's job to give a

13

rational interpretation to the statute, and it was

14

entirely proper to give deference to the Authority,

15

notwithstanding the fact that it was adjudicating disputes

16

between employees and Federal agencies.

your notion that the statute, then, is not clear, it's

the Authority would not have an option.

It has to be one

way or the other, I think.

4

MR. O'DUDEN:

No.

As I said earlier, I don't

think that the Authority does have an option to conclude

anything other than what the D.C. Circuit said

ago, but to the extent that the party, the respondent is

light of the fact that a court of appeal has differed from

You can't find in the text anything referring to midterm

Not a continuing process.
But that begs the question, of

10

that's why you have to go to the statutory definition of

that phrase.
QUESTION:

12

MR. O'DUDEN:

2

Right.

I think that the absence

3

of this 8(d) proviso ultimately is of no consequence here.

4

I think it's almost counterintuitive.

5

exception-proves-no-rule type of argument.

6

It's a kind of no-

I think it's important to bear in mind that even

7

before this 8(d) proviso was added to the NLRA there was

8

no question under that statute that employers did have to

9

engage in midterm bargaining.

10

I think that the principle --

But was there any question whether

12

they had to engage in it even with regard to issues that

had been decided in the collective bargaining agreement?

you, is it a construction of any provision in the statute,

14

MR. O'DUDEN:

Your Honor, the principle that the

parties do not have to engage in bargaining regarding

matters contained in the contract is such a well-settled

17

principle of labor law, it's such -- a principle that's so

well-integrated into the labor law jurisprudence --

So well-settled that Congress found

it necessary to say it explicitly in the National Labor

If it was so well --

MR. O'DUDEN:

That was 30 years before they

3

QUESTION:

On the threshold question raised by-

4

Justice Scalia as to whether or not we should give Chevron

5

deference to the petitioner agency here rather than to the

6

President and to the executive branch as a whole, you did

7

not take the position that Chevron deference cannot be

8

given to the petitioning agency, did you?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct, we did not, and

10

the reason is, this Court's decision seems to have --

11

seemed to have settled that question, including the Fort

12

Stewart Schools decision and others that, as a general

3

matter at least, the FLRA is entitled to Chevron

4

deference.

5

Is the reason because the Federal Labor-

6

Management Relations Agency has more expertise on this

7

general subject than does the Government Executive's

8

establishment in general?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That would not be the reason.

think the reason would be that Congress has delegated the

the general way, the approach the Court takes in deciding

whether an agency gets Chevron deference.

that because of this delegation it develops an expertise,

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, that does become part of

it, but I would just say that it's first and foremost the

delegation of authority that leads to Chevron deference,

And what do you rely on primarily for

saying we don't owe deference to this decision?

Well then, why can't you call when

You can call it that, but that's

not what's provided for in 7114.

What's -- management

10

changes is provided for in 7106, which is in 25 -- 26a of

11

the white petition, in (b), which describes the duties

12

that managements have to negotiate not just at the point

13

that it's arriving at a basic comprehensive collective

14

bargaining agreement, but also throughout on a continuous

15

basis, so if management exercises management rights at any

point during the course of the agreement, it has a duty to

negotiate by virtue of the duty spelled out in 7106(b)(2)

The obvious place is right over here in 7114(a)(4), where

it says, a collective bargaining agreement, which isn't

defined and, since it isn't defined, the obvious thing is

that by a collective bargaining agreement, they meant --

there is with most agencies, like the NLRB and others.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

5

Well, the answer is that the

6

term, collective bargaining agreement, is not subject to

7

the kind of interpretation that you're suggesting.

8

Collective bargaining agreement, the established meaning

9

of that in the private labor field, is comprehensive term

10

agreement.
When this Court in its decisions refers to

11

12

collective bargaining agreements, it is always referring

13

to comprehensive term agreements.

14

products of midterm discussions, it is talking about

15

supplements to the agreement, modifications to the

agreement, amendments to the agreement, and that is -- the

different -- other than in its ordinary usage.

2

only management could initiate negotiations to -- about

3

those appropriate arrangements?

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, Justice Stevens.

We're

5

saying that the only bargaining that takes place arises by

6

virtue of management making the change, and then once

7

management makes the change midterm, the union could

Does that mean that whenever

midterm negotiation initiated by the union would be

appropriate?

17

Can't you say that in the event of a change in the

workplace it's a reasonable time to negotiate about that

right after it occurs?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

10

Well, on -- 7103(12) is a

definition.

Ultimately the duty that you find, Justice

12

Kennedy, is in 7114(a)(4), which also talks about meeting

at reasonable times, but it ties the meeting at reasonable

times to the overriding duty, which is to negotiate for

is that Congress has decided on the basic structure of

there are many other venues for -- as the Fourth Circuit

and for Federal agencies that did not want to engage in

MR. GORNSTEIN:

1

That's correct.

Not only that,

2

but if the bargaining did not seem productive from the

3

agency's point of view it could cut it off, and it would

4

not be an unfair labor practice of not bargaining in good

5

faith.
QUESTION:

6

Could they, do you think, say well,

7

if we can't agree among ourselves we'll let it be

8

arbitrated by the agency?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

That's possible, Justice

10

Stevens.

I wouldn't want to rule out single after-the-

11

fact solutions to problems on particular issues, but what

12

is objectionable here is a clause that commits the agency

13

to open-ended midterm bargaining without limit.

14

QUESTION:

Is -- if you were going back

15

hypothetically, putting yourself in the position of a

16

Congressman who thought this -- realized this was all

17

going to come up years later, would you have thought, or

18

why not -- I'm putting it against you.

19

Wouldn't it have -- leave it up to the agency.

20

You know, if these things --we don't know if it will work

21

out well or badly.

22

follow it.

23

change the rule, as it might have the authority to do.

24
25

If it works out well, then they'll

If it works out badly, the FLRA itself will

Wouldn't that be a practical -- if we're talking
practicalities, isn't that practical?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

1

I think that Congress had a very

2

big concern that it expressed in 7101(b), that this

3

statute should not be interpreted in a way that threatens

4

the effective and efficient administration of justice, and

5

that is -- administration of the Government, and that is

6

in 24(a).

7

QUESTION:

But Congress also thought that

8

collective bargaining would advance the interest of the

9

Government --

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That'S --

-- in efficient management.
That's correct as a general

13

matter, but it did not believe that unending bargaining

14

would, and Congress recognized that there were special

15

needs, and that's what 7101(b) reflects, that there are

16

special needs in the Federal Government and in Government

17

in general that there have to be reasonable limitations

18

that are not present in the private sector.

19

QUESTION:

Is there anything that suggested that

20

Congress thought that the agency was differently situated

21

than private -- in the private sector, where by this time,

22

by the time this statute is enacted midterm bargaining is

23

long-established?

MR. GORNSTEIN:
things.

Well, I think there are two

different.

2

collectively in the National Labor Relations Act, subject

3

to a specific exception for matters contained in the

4

agreement.

5
6

7

There was an open-ended duty to bargain

QUESTION:

Yes, but there was no -- nothing

originally.
Taft-Hartley brought in the 8(d) exception, but

8

originally there wasn't anything that said, there shall be

9

midterm bargaining, was there?

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, there was an open-ended

11

duty to bargain collectively, which the National Labor

12

Relations Act -- Authority, the NLRB interpreted to lead

3

to wide-open bargaining, and then Congress cut that back

4

to the contained in.

5

But even the open-ended term, bargain

6

collectively, is bigger than the term here, which is

7

bargaining for the purpose of arriving at a collective

8

bargaining agreement, a narrower obligation than the

9

original NLR -- National Labor Relations Act duty that was

20
21

subsequently reduced.
QUESTION:

The big difference, as I understand

22

your position, is that there is no disincentive here to

23

raise it midterm, as there is in the private sector.

24
25

In the private sector, if you come to an impasse
midterm and you want to make something of it, you have to

call a strike.

After you've gone through a big collective

2

bargaining agreement you're usually not going to get your

3

union members to be willing to do that.
Whereas here, if you raise it midterm and you go

to an impasse, it's cost-free.

QUESTION:

Basically a policy wonk, you're

right.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

17

Scalia, that's absolutely correct.

18

Yes.

But that is -- yes, Justice

That was the second enormous difference that

19

Congress faced when it was looking at this act as it

20

compared to the private sector experience.

21

The kind of incentives that would be in play for

22

midterm bargaining are just completely different, and when

23

you can take every issue to impasse, you have the

24

incentive to raise any issue of any concern to any Federal

QUESTION:

1

Of course, I'm not really convinced

2

that every mid-term bargaining in the private sector that

3

doesn't reach an agreement results in a strike.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

4

I -- Justice Stevens, what

5

happens is that unions do not raise things midterm in the

6

private sector unless they are of crucial importance, and

7

therefore there isn't a lot of union-initiated midterm

8

bargaining in the private sector because their only

9

recourse is to strike at impasse, and it was something

10

which is very difficult to accomplish midterm except over

11

some very crucial issue.
QUESTION:

12

On that point, is there some source,

13

some body of authority that we could consult to determine

14

how midterm bargaining works in the private sector?

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, I think we

16

cited in our brief a text that talked about that this was

17

something that was not done very frequently, and I think

18

that the law review article that we refer to also in the

19

brief discussed the fact that this is not something that

20

is done in the private sector very often.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. SMITH

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

3

The very first sentence of the

4

Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute notes

5

that Congress has examined both the public and private

6

sectors and has determined that collective bargaining is

7

in the public interest.

8

out in the statute has no limitation as to the

9

circumstances when it must occur.

That collective bargaining as set

We've heard the respondent offer their spin of

10
11

what collective bargaining agreements mean.

12

look to the term of art in the statute set out in section

3

7 03(a)(8).

4

mean in the private sector.

5

They don't

Instead they say, this is what it's come to

In point of fact, we have specific terms of art

6

defined in the statute before you that tell you what a

7

collective bargaining agreement is --

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, but he says the collective

bargaining agreement in labor relations means an agreement

20

that's negotiated from term to term, and anything else is

21

called a supplementary agreement or an additional

22

agreement.

23

point to where that isn't so?

24

MR. SMITH:

25

Now, is there some example that you could

That isn't so in the wording of our

statute, Justice Breyer.

QUESTION:

1

No, no, but I mean, let's find --

2

that's what's at issue, so let's find an agreement

3

somewhere that was made midterm, in any context

4

whatsoever, where it was labeled by some person in a case

5

or in a statute or something to say that's a collective

6

bargaining agreement.

7
8

They don't use the word supplementary agreement.
They don't use the word additional agreement.

9

MR. SMITH:

We have the word local agreement

10

used in our statute to describe agreements entered into at

11

the local level between those that are not at the national

12

level, so there's one example for you where the word is

13

used.

of the statute.

That is specifically set out in section 7114(c) (4)

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

7114(c)(4)?
Yes.
That could be a local collective

18

bargaining agreement in the sense that the Solicitor

19

General uses it.

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Which would disprove their -I mean, it could be a local agreement

that lasts 3 years, couldn't it?
MR. SMITH:

Which would disprove the point that

24

there's only one collective bargaining agreement and

everything else is simply a modification or a supplement

Our view is there can be numerous collective

If I could address one other matter briefly, we

have not talked about the negotiability of this provision.

We stand on the statutory right analysis and we believe,

there is a right to engage in midterm bargaining.
