CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The district court in this case sanctioned

11
12

petitioner, who is not a party to the underlying

13

litigation, but instead was the plaintiff's counsel.

14

question presented to this Court is at what time

15

petitioner should appeal the sanction.

The

The Sixth Circuit recognized that there were

16
17

three possible answers to that question.

18

this is the rule the that the Sixth Circuit adopted, is

19

that petitioner should wait until the final judgment in

20

the case.

21

First and foremost, it conflicts with this Court's

22

repeated holding for more than 100 years that only parties

23

may appeal the final judgment.

24

QUESTION:

25

The first, and

That rule, however, has some serious problems.

But there are exceptions to that

rule, are there not, Mr. Goldstein?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, there is an

2

indication in this Court's precedents that there are a

3

class of persons known as quasi-parties who may appeal,

4

but the quasi-party cases do not determine whether or not

5

that appeal should be brought at the end of the case or

6

not.

7

Marino v. Ortiz and Karcher v. May, instruct that the test

8

is whether or not the individual who seeks to appeal could

9

intervene in the case under Rule 24(b), and there is no

10

question that petitioner could not intervene under Rule

11

24(b).

12

This Court's most recent precedents, particularly

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldstein, you have recognized

13

that, if the client had been sanctioned as well, the

14

client would have to wait till the end of the line and

15

presumably the lawyer, too, and the lawyer, although not a

16

party, could then appeal, so that seems to be inconsistent

17

with your position.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The circuits that have

19

confronted this question uniformly agree, and so do we,

20

that when that sanction merges into the final judgment,

21

practicalities require that the sanction itself come up

22

together, because it would be injudicious --

23

QUESTION:

But we have a nonparty, the attorney,

24

who could take an appeal then, so the Chief asked if that

25

rule is without exception.

One exception would be this

1

very situation if the client were sanctioned along with

2

the lawyer.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct, but we do

4

believe that that position is consistent with our views of

5

Rules 3 and 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

6

That sanction merges into the final judgment because it

7

is -- it operates upon the client.

8

9

QUESTION:

If you're wrong about the possibility

of the attorney appealing the sanction at the end of the

10

line, if you're wrong about that, then I take it you

11

concede that you could not prevail here.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Respectfully, no.

There are

13

very serious practical consequences that make this

14

sanction effectively unreviewable at the end of the case

15

under the third prong of the Cohen doctrine.

16

particular, we - -

17

QUESTION:

In

Before we get to those, I'm sort of

18

perplexed by the inconsistency at the other end.

Why is

19

it that an attorney would not be a party for purposes of

20

appealing immediately --

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22

QUESTION:

The --

-- but -- I mean, would be a party,

23

treated like a party for purposes of appealing

24

immediately, but would not be a party for purposes of

25

appealing at the end of the case?

I mean, I don't see

1

why, conceptually, that makes any sense.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

It requires this Court to track

3

Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and

4

that rule instructs that you may appeal from an order or a

5

judgment to which you are a party.

6

the petitioner is a party to the sanction order.

7

directed at her.

8

final judgment, with which she has nothing to do.

It is

She is not, however, a party to the

QUESTION:

9

No one contests that

Well, so you're saying she could

10

appeal the --on the basis of the order, in - - but she

11

couldn't appeal from the final judgment.

12

very strange result.

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That seems a

Mr. Chief Justice, this Court

14

has been quite clear that the final judgment itself has to

15

be looked at in isolation, and you determine whether or

16

not the appellant is a party to the final judgment.

17

QUESTION:

But she's not appealing the final

18

judgment.

19

to determine when she may appeal.

20

the order, whether she appeals it immediately or later.

21

The final judgment is simply what we refer to

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

She's still appealing

That is correct, the difference

22

being that under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate

23

Procedure she is precluded from appealing the sanction

24

order more than 30 days after it's entered.

Rule 4 further instructs that the entry is to be

The sanction

She had

Mr. Goldstein, there are all kinds of

orders that are made in the course of a trial proceeding,

orders that are not immediately reviewable, and you don't

13

lose out because of the 30-day limit.

14

applies to a final order, not to an interlocutory order.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I think that that

That is correct.

This Court has

16

instructed that mere discovery rulings, or anything else,

17

really, that goes to a party to the litigation, one of the

18

actual litigants, all of those merge into the final

19

judgment.

20

it is a third party, when it is not a litigant who is in

21

question, and we point the Court particularly to Alexander

22

and its progeny, which are discussed at length in the blue

23

brief, and those cases instruct that when you are dealing

24

with a third party who has been punished by the district

25

court, that order does not merge into the final judgment.

But the Court has been equally clear that when

The only time that it may be appealed is directly upon its

imposition.

the actual litigants before the district court and third

4

parties who might be punished by - -

5

The Court has drawn a very clear line between

QUESTION:

Well, if the Court should decide that

6

no such line was ever drawn and that it would make no

7

sense to draw it, that is, the judgment is the occasion,

8

as Justice Scalia said, it answers the when question.

9

can appeal it then.

10

You

The attorney isn't seeking to reverse the

11

judgment against the client, but is seeking to review an

12

order that was made along the way.

13

to tell us that even if it's right that this would be

14

appealable at the end of the line, still, you said, it

15

could be appealed earlier because --

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Exactly.

So you were beginning

If I could return to

17

your earlier question, the sanction is effectively

18

unreviewable, notwithstanding a holding by this Court that

19

petitioner technically could file a notice of appeal from

20

the final judgment.

21

There are two classes of reasons.

The first is, it

22

is not at all clear that there will be a final judgment.

23

The district court, for whatever reason, might never close

24

the case, the case could settle, the case could simply

25

languish, and the attorney would never have a triggering

right, under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ever

to bring such an appeal.

3

In addition, along with those practical

considerations, the attorney really is injured in the

interim.

ground for appeal, but when you look at all the practical

considerations for an attorney, the attorney is forced to

QUESTION:

Well, in this case it was stayed.

The order was stayed, was it not?

Respectfully, no.

There is a

the collection of the sanction but from the entry of the

order.

Does that mean that the order could

that that is a good course for district courts to take.

injury out of it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If a district court were to do

so, if the district court were to announce to an attorney,

I believe you have contravened my ruling, I believe you

have engaged in irresponsible conduct and at the end of

sure they're not going to get into this business of trying

QUESTION:

9

We do think that our rule is

We don't

Oh, well, why wouldn't it give rise

10

to the problem of, in many sanctions cases, when they get

11

to the court of appeals it would be mixed up with the

could first deal with the Rule 8 problem, and that is that

The Court has been very clear that the writs under

the All Writs Act, including writs of mandate,

the lawyer withdraws, so that he's not still representing

appeal to the end, would you mind staying the payment

until the end of the case, and the judge would say no.

23

can't believe a judge would do that, but if the judge did

say no, you would go to the court of appeals and ask them

for a stay.

Is there any problem with that?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We do read the rules to not

permit it, and in fact we have studied every single

14

interlocutory attorney sanction appeal that has been

15

brought in the last 20 years, and a court of appeal has

16

never, ever allowed a writ of mandamus or Rule 54(b)

certification, a 1292 certification.

18

expect you to file a timely notice of appeal, and those

19

circuits that are on the bottom of the split and do not

believe that an interlocutory appeal is permitted simply

21

will have nothing to do with it.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldstein, when Justice Breyer

23

Given that signal from Congress, why should we

do anything by adjudication to add to the list of

interlocutory orders that are immediately appealable?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, the Court

8

has -- and you have pointed this out in an earlier opinion

9

for the Court that that option is open to this Court to

10

begin the rule-making process, which respectfully, it has

11

never seen fit to do, and there are no less than a dozen

12

splits in the circuits about when various interlocutory

13

orders may be brought to this Court.

14

We have no objection if the Court were to, in

QUESTION:

Well, if it's just a matter of

use the Cohen factors, some of which have very little to

do with finality.

why not take those same practical considerations into

account in the present instance?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

1

That's correct.

Petitioner

believed that it was inappropriate for her to bring an

3

appeal from the final judgment in the case.

noting that at the time she filed her notice of appeal,

every single circuit that had confronted these facts had

ruled in her favor.

QUESTION:

It is worth

because it seems that would put her in the best position?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is not correct,

respectfully.

Under Rule 38 -- there were sanctions

11

motions filed upon the filing of this notice of appeal.

Under Rule 38, if she files an improper notice of appeal

uncertain, so I filed a notice of appeal at the

court of appeals would sanction a lawyer for doing that?

At the -- it is a concern that

be filing unnecessary protective appeals, but it is worth

2

returning to our argument under Rule 4(a)(2), and that is

3

that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure explicitly

4

contemplate that if you file too early your notice of

5

appeal automatically functions to be protective.
QUESTION:

6

May I ask in - - picking up on your

7

last colloquy with Justice Scalia, do you acknowledge that

8

this is a Cohen problem at all?

9

refer to parties.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

Cohen orders usually

That's absolutely correct.

We

11

have fitted within the Cohen doctrine because most of the

12

courts of appeal have, but the closest analogue,

13

truthfully, are the cases in which this Court has dealt

14

with third parties who are punished, and they deal with

15

them completely outside of the Cohen doctrine, because

16

it's final as to that person, cases like Alexander and the

17

like.

18

QUESTION:

May I ask, when you talk about the

19

closest analogue, is there anything we can learn from the

20

procedure when a lawyer is actually held in contempt, as

21

opposed to just sanctions?

22

so forth?

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

When do you appeal then, and

Respectfully, yes.

We believe

24

that, for example, under Rule 16(h) of the Rules of Civil

25

Procedure, petitioner could have been held in civil

1

contempt, and there is no question that -- respectfully,

2

we believe there's no question that she could have

3

appealed at that time, because the Court is very clear

4

that nonparty civil contempts are immediately appealable.

5

There is no practical difference in terms of the effect on

6

district courts, or on the effect on courts of appeals.

7

Why, if the district court says, this is not

8

merely a Rule 37 sanction, I'm going to put next to it the

9

word contempt, why one should be appealable and one should

10
11

not.

In addition -QUESTION:

And is it true that the contempt

12

cases we've reviewed have been reviewed on the

13

interlocutory stage, rather than after the final judgment?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

In fact, that's the

15

express direction.

16

Catholic Conference in 1988, and that was absolutely

17

interlocutory, and the precedents in the blue brief

18

explain that a -- appeal from the final judgment in fact

19

would not be permitted.

QUESTION:

The most recent case is United States

They have --

But isn't an attorney given

21

considerably more procedural rights in the case of a

22

citation for contempt than for a sanction?

notice and opportunity to be heard, but civil contempt

particular, again, Rule 16(h) allows the district court to

simply deem this to be a contempt, and so does Rule 37(b),

3

which also deals with discovery sanctions.

district court could have deemed it to be a civil

In terms of -- there just would be no practical

difference on the effect on the district court or a court

10

of appeal that a -- that the district court labels it

contempt.

12

But if we could - - if I could mention one other

13

practical difference, and that is, it seems a bad

14

practical and policy judgment to tell the attorney, well,

15

if you go that one step further and get yourself held in

16

civil contempt, then you can appeal, because that has

17

grave collateral consequences on the attorney's client.

QUESTION:

suicide, too, but I'm not really worried about it.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Respondent has suggested that

5

this rule that we propose would lead to lots of attempts

6

to appeal, that attorneys might get themselves sanctioned

7

in order to have the right to take an appeal, and we hope

8

the Court will take the same practical view of that as
well.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Goldstein, can I ask you, if you

11

say that Cohen is really not implicated here, then there

12

really is no way to handle the case where you have an

13

interlocutory appeal and it is intimately bound up with

14

the merits of the case, that really whether there was a

15

sanctionable conduct or not depends entirely upon how you

16

view the merits of the case, which seems to me not at all

17

an unusual situation.

What do you do in that case?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

1

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Breyer --

Since we're not applying Cohen you

can't say, well, although most of these things would be

because what is being appealed is not the underlying

or not the attorney misbehaved, and that is the line that

this Court drew in - *

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but the ones I've actually seen,

6

where we had appeals, they -- the argument would be that

7

the attorney, for example, asked too many questions or

8

something in a deposition, way out of line, and the

9

defense would be something like, well, if you really

10

understood this case you'd understand that these questions

11

aren't out of line.

12

you'd see that my delay was reasonable.

13

start arguing about, what's this case really about, and at

14

that point, if I were a client, I'd say -- I'd want to be

15

in there, you know, before the court of appeals takes a

16

view of this.

17

If you really understood this case,
And then they'd

I mean, that's the kind of thing I'm concerned

18

about, and I guess that's the kind of thing that's led the

19

lower courts not to allow appeals in cases where the

20

attorney's in there and hasn't been dismissed, and a lot

21

of other instances.

22

That's what's worrying me.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There are two answers.

The

23

first deals with the legal standard, and the second with

what actually is brought up on appeal.

6

We do not want a

And when you have the question on appeal, to

7

turn to the practical effect of what's brought up for the

8

appeal, if you take a Rule 37 sanctions, the question is,

9

did the attorney behave unreasonably in believing that a

10

particular question or deposition or interrogatory would

11

lead to the discoverability of admissible evidence, and we

12

proceed further and further away from the actual merits of

13

the legal claims.

14

And in point of fact, this Court let this split

15

in the circuits percolate for two decades, and the

16

majority rule in the circuits by far, based on the

17

experiences of courts of appeal judges like you formerly

18

were, Mr. Justice Breyer, is that this does not intertwine

19

with the merits and disrupt district court proceedings.

20

In particular, the court looks at -- the courts

21

have noted two points.

It doesn't result in a stay of the

22

district court proceedings because the district court

23

case, just like it did here, continues apace until it gets

to final judgment.

10

So is a disqualification order, and

why isn't that the closer analogy than a contempt
citation?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

There are two keys to the

12

disqualification cases.

The first is the conclusion in

13

Richardson-Merrell that the attorney doesn't get to appeal

14

the disqualification.

That runs against the client, not

15

against the attorney.

And the second is that the district

MR. ARNOLD:

That's an extension of the

rationale that applies to this case, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, frequently, and I think this

Court has admonished trial judges that if you're thinking

5

of holding a lawyer in contempt, either tell him that

6

you're thinking about it, but wait awhile.

words, don't simply cite him from the bench, but hold off

8

for a while, and maybe do what Judge Medina did in the

9

communist case, have a hearing at the end of the trial,

In other

10

and of course that would remove the appealability problem

11

there, since surely a contempt citation with a fine at the

12

end of the trial would be appealable.

13

15

MR. ARNOLD:

Yes, it would, because it would at

that point merge with the final judgment of the case.
QUESTION:

Well, what discretion does a trial

16

judge have to defer the effectiveness of an order of

17

sanction, or to defer -- what discretion would a court of

18

appeals have to defer holding any hearings on it until the

19

end of the case?

20

MR. ARNOLD:

Well, the trial court does, of

21

course, have the discretion to decide when they are going

22

to make that decision, when they are going to impose that

23

sanction, or even if they -- and the courts below have

24

seen the situation where the court has found, or ordered,

the notice of appeal have to be filed in 30 days of the

MR. ARNOLD:

If this Court adopts a rule that

17

says that attorneys may only appeal from the final

decision of the Court, no.

19

appeal should be perfected within the appropriate time

20

from the final order of the district court.

1

Should the best resolution of this

problem be to leave the effectiveness of it in the

MR. ARNOLD:

That is one resolution, but I

submit the better resolution is to simply announce a

rule suggest that the most practical, the most judicially

9

efficient manner of doing it is to announce the rule that

10

the attorney may perfect that appeal at the conclusion of

11

the case.

12

Either the attorney can appeal or not

QUESTION:

The problem is, is that these

13

sanction orders are sometimes entered by the court when

14

its patience has run out, the court is angry at the

15

attorney, sometimes for a good cause, sometimes not, and

16

there's a real danger that the district judges can

17

overstep and require an attorney to come forward with a

18

substantial sum of money for a sanction, and that just

19

seems to me to be a very harsh rule, especially in this

20

case, where the attorney is out of the case.

21

MR. ARNOLD:

Your Honor, I would suggest that

22

it's a balancing test the Court has to reach, and it's a

23

balancing test that should be answered not just on this

24

particular case, on a $1,500 sanction, but on the broader

issue, and that is, there will be, perhaps in the case

and more sanctions for the same refusal, and there would

16

be no way to review it until the case is over, even though

17

the materials might be critical to the outcome of the

18

case.

19

MR. ARNOLD:

And that I believe is one of the

20

balancing factors, one of the factors the Court must take

21

into account when it balances these things.

22

to have the courts of appeal reviewing evidentiary

23

decisions before the trial is over?

MR. ARNOLD:

And that is certainly a reason, we

that works to control this attorney, but then I thought

the answer to that was, if the attorney's that bad, then

guess you could postpone it if you're prepared to
investigate the merits of the underlying case, investigate

10

the merits of the appeal, and then decide how closely they

11

are to related, while you happen to have 300 other cases

12

on the docket with which the court of appeals is supposed

13

to deal.

14

Now you're going to agree with that "huh."
MR. ARNOLD:

I think that is an example of the

15

burdens multiple appeals impose upon the parties and the

16

courts below.

17

In summary, we ask this Court to strictly

18

construe the final judgment rule and decline to expand

1

that narrow class of cases to which Cohen applies, to

20

pretrial discovery sanctions imposed by the district

21

court.

22

the conclusion of the case will avoid judicial delays, it

will serve the purposes of judicial efficiency, while

giving the petitioner the opportunity at the close of the

case to raise the issue on appeal.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

QUESTION:

The Hickman example, Justice --

Did the Court discuss appealability

at all in Hickman?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, and the

Court is very clear that there aren't implicit

jurisdictional holdings.
