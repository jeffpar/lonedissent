ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns whether an office of

12

Inspector General investigator interviewing a Federal

13

unionized employee for alleged misconduct is a, quote,

14

representative of the agency who must allow the

15

participation of a union representative under the Federal

16

Service Labor-Management Relations statute.

17

The FLRA and the court of appeals held that the

18

OIG agent is such a representative either because the

19

Inspector General is under the control of agency

20

management or because the office of Inspector General

21

investigative work product provides a benefit to agency

22

management.

23

Both theories are mistaken.

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Frederick, before you get too far

into it, how is the FLRA appointed?

Is it a independent

agency?
MR. FREDERICK:

3

appointed by the President.
QUESTION:

4
5

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

The President can remove

the officers in the FLRA.
QUESTION:

8

9

But once appointed, cannot be removed

by him?

6

7

Yes, it is, Justice Scalia,

Well, if all of the agencies don't

like this ruling that the FLRA has come up with, why don't

10

they just tell the President to -- you know, to tell them

11

to shape up or ship out and put in people who will agree

12

with what the agencies want?

13

solve this internal executive branch problem?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Why do you come to us to

This Court has made clear on

15

numerous decisions, Justice Scalia, that this particular

16

statutory scheme is permissible and acceptable and that

17

the courts are the appropriate place to resolve disputes

18

that arise between the FLRA and agency management.

19

this case is no different from those other types of

20

disputes.

21

QUESTION:

You're right.

And

We've done it before,

22

but I must say, it just seems surpassing strange.

I mean,

23

here you have the agencies -- usually when you have a

24

disagreement among the agencies, you go to the -- you go

25

to the chief executive and you say, you know, the FBI and

the CIA are in disagreement.

2

to prevail.
QUESTION:

3

Tell us which one is going

We had the Federal Power Commission

4

suing the Department of Interior 50 years ago, 60 years

5

ago here in this Court.
QUESTION:

6

So, this is nothing unusual.

Well, the Power -- isn't the Power

7

Commission an independent -- wasn't the Power Commission

8

an independent regulatory agency?
MR. FREDERICK:

10

I'm not an -- I am not prepared

on the Federal Power Commission.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I think it was so the President

12

couldn't control it.

13

of that, I could understand why you had to come here, but

14

here you have two agencies -- one agency against the rest

15

of the Government, all of them within the control of the

16

President, and -- well, all right.

17

before.

18

but it seems surpassing strange.

1

Now, whatever the constitutionality

You say we've done it

I guess -- I guess that's enough of an answer,

MR. FREDERICK:

If I could return to this case,

20

the control theory upon which the court below based --

21

part of its theory is based on a mistaken construction of

22

the Inspector General Act, a statute that is outside the

23

FLRA's expertise.

24

requires that the Inspector General be under the, quote,

25

general supervision of the head of the agency, that

Although the Inspector General Act

requirement does not transform the Inspector General into

2

a representative of the agency.

3

supervision requirement requires the Inspector General to

4

comply with the generally applicable rules and regulations

5

of the agency, such as procurement rules, equal employment

6

opportunity regulations, limitations on outside employment

7

by the Federal employees that are partisan, political -QUESTION:

8

Rather, the general

Well, Mr. Frederick, normally we

would defer to the agency interpretation of the meaning of
10

the language, and here the FLRA wants to tell us that they

11

interpret this language of representative of the agency as

12

including the Inspector General.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

First, that interpretation rests not so much on

Deference --

So, why don't we defer?
Two reasons, Justice O'Connor.

17

an interpretation of what representative of the agency

18

means, but an application of that to the Inspector General

1

Act.

The theory -- and I have given two theories.

20

One is that the control by the agency

21

representative constitutes who a representative of the

22

agency is.

23

misconstrued the Inspector General Act.

24

entitled to deference because that is not a statute within

25

their expertise.

The FLRA is wrong about that because they have
They are not

The second theory is that the IG provides a

1

2

benefit to agency management.

The FLRA is not entitled to

3

deference under that theory for several reasons.

4

First, their interpretation that any entity that

5

provides a benefit to agency management is -- is seriously

6

overbroad.

7

behind the labor statute and it would also encroach on an

8

Inspector General's independence.

9

an agency's Inspector General, but it would also apply to

That construction departs from the purposes

It would reach not only

10

Federal and State law enforcement officers who investigate

11

criminal wrongdoing by agency employees and submit an

12

investigative report to the head of the agency who then

13

uses that report for disciplinary purposes.

14

QUESTION:

Could I come to your first point?

15

You say the FLRA does not have the expertise.

16

that the criterion for whether we give deference?

17

thought it was rather whether the agency was acting within

18

its scope of administration.

19

agency has been given authority over, whether or not it's

20

very expert, even if in this aspect of it it may not know

21

any more than courts, if it has been given authority over

22

that area, we generally defer.

23

given authority over this area to -- to stop this or to

24

permit it?

1

no, and the reason is that there is nothing in the

2

Inspector General Act that gives the FLRA authority to

3

construe the provisions of that statute just as this Court

4

in the ATF case held that the FLRA was not entitled to

5

deference in -- in construing the travel allowance

6

statute, which is a statute that was outside its area of

7

presumed expertise.

8

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the statute we were

construing was 5 U.S. Code, section 7114(a)(2)(B).
10

that right?
MR. FREDERICK:

11
12

QUESTION:

Is that within the jurisdiction of

the FLRA?

MR. FREDERICK:

QUESTION:

1
20

That's correct, Justice

O' Connor.

13
14

Is

Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.

So, why can't it say what is meant by

the term a representative of the agency?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, there are two bases on

which it has done that, and -- and let me try again.
What a representative is depends upon the

21

application of various other laws, and the basis of their

22

decision is -- is based on two theories.

23

One is that a -- to be a representative, one has

24

to be under the control of agency management.

25

that question, you have to look to the Inspector General

1

Act, which is the statute that the FLRA has no particular

2

expertise in construing, and they simply misconstrued that

3

statute.

4

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Frederick, I didn't

5

understand them as doing that.

6

we're dealing with a statute that codifies the Weingarten

7

rule.

8

foremost, the person who's supposed to benefit from that

I thought they said, well,

So, the focus of our inquiry is, first and

rule, the employee who was there alone confronted by the
10

employer with an allegation of serious misconduct,

11

frightened and needful of help.

12

Weingarten rule was meant to take care of, and that's what

13

the FLRA has in its charge.

14

That's what the

And then it says, for this purpose and this

15

purpose only, does the Inspector General represent the

16

agency vis-a-vis that employer?

17

very limited sense with the first view of FLRA its

18

bailiwick, which is we've got this statute that codifies

1

the Weingarten rule.

20
21
22

And it was only in that

What was Weingarten supposed to do?

MR. FREDERICK:

I have several responses to

that, Justice Ginsburg.
First, the Weingarten decision itself was based

23

on equalizing the balance of power between labor and

24

management.

25

subsequent decisions, it does not include those employees

It -- it -- as has been construed in

1

who are not unionized.

2

enforcement agencies.

3

interviewing a unionized employee for the -- so that the

4

rights that were collectively bargained would not be

5

undermined by management by using the investigatory

6

process.

It only includes management

That concern is not present here because the

7
8

It does not include outside law

Inspector General is precluded from participating in the
collective bargaining process and is not part of that

10
11

process.
QUESTION:

What was the -- all the language in

12

Weingarten -- and I realize that Weingarten itself is not

13

what's before us, but 7114 -- that the employee may be too

14

fearful or inarticulate to relate accurate -- accurately

15

the incident being investigated?

16

we're concerned about equalizing bargaining power across

17

the table over an agreement, but the concern is 262 to 263

18

of Weingarten where the Court speaks of the fearful,

1

inarticulate employee who may not be able to relate

20

accurately the incident that's being investigated or being

21

too ignorant to raise extenuating circumstances.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

That doesn't sound like

That was a factor, Justice

23

Ginsburg, but as we have quoted in our main brief at pages

24

20 to 21 from the Court's Weingarten decision at pages 260

25

to 261, the safeguard is to redress the perceived

1

imbalance of economic power between labor and management.
QUESTION:

2

The -- the statute says an exclusive

3

representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall

4

be given the opportunity to be represented.

5

representation is of the union.

6

individual.
MR. FREDERICK:

7

The

It isn't of the

That's correct, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

And it's also clear that if a person is not an

9

employee or is not a -- a person as defined under the

10

Federal labor statute, that person cannot invoke the

11

rights under the Weingarten statute.

12

approximately 45 percent of the non-uniformed Federal work

13

place -- work force cannot invoke these Weingarten rights.

14

So, it is perfectly clear that what Congress was intending

15

to get at was the balance of power between management

16

which would negotiate collective bargaining agreements and

17

the unionized work force which would be on the other side

18

of that --

19

QUESTION:

At present

Why wouldn't Congress have just

20

wanted to, just thinking about it crudely, say, well, if a

21

person who can afford it can have his lawyer in the room,

22

many of those who can't afford it could have their union

23

rep?

24

kind of thing, not in every case, but by and large --

25

protect the individual, particularly ones who can't afford

I mean, the union rep would just represent the same

to pay for the lawyer.

2

that at all, but that's my question.

3

- why wouldn't you want that?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

I mean, maybe they didn't think
Why wouldn't they -

Well, that would be --

Why isn't that a reasonable

interpretation of what Congress was doing here?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Breyer, it is not.

8

And it is reasonable if management is conducting the

9

interview, and we would concede that in those --

10

throughout the Federal Government in virtually every

11

department, management conducts interviews for

12

disciplinary purposes of employees.

13

contexts, it is perfectly appropriate for a union

14

representative to be present at that interview.

15

And in those

But an Inspector General investigation is not an

16

to designate the Inspector General to do anything, to

order the Inspector General to designate what the

20

Agency management doesn't have the authority

QUESTION:

No, that's right.

But, I mean, my -

22

- my question is really just focusing on -- assuming it's

23

linguistically possible, is it a reasonable interpretation

24

of what Congress might have been after?

25

obviously, if Congress is trying to protect the individual

by giving him a right to have his union rep present, this

2

would be the classic case where he needs the protection.
MR. FREDERICK:

4

Breyer.
QUESTION:

5
6

No, it would not, Justice

All right.

Well, that's what I would

like you to explain.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

In the private sector, if an FBI

8

agent shows up at a company to interview an employee who

9

is accused of criminal wrongdoing, there is no Weingarten

10

right.

And the reason why there is no Weingarten right is

11

that the FBI doesn't represent the corporation's

12

management.

13

is provided with independence within a -- within the

14

agency so that it does not represent agency management --

In the same way here, the Inspector General

15
16

QUESTION:

Would the Weingarten right apply in

17

the private sector if the employer hired the Pinkerton

18

Detective Agency to come in and conduct the interview?

MR. FREDERICK:

20

QUESTION:

MR. FREDERICK:

MR. FREDERICK:

It would apply.
Yes, because --

Why isn't that the same as this?

MR. FREDERICK:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And wouldn't they normally, if they

10

discovered some kind of employee misconduct, report it to

11

the agency?
MR. FREDERICK:

12

That's correct, but that doesn't

13

transform the Inspector General into an agents -- anymore

14

than the FBI is --

QUESTION:

No, but the whole purpose of the

He's got some control and some independence.

not true because the -- an independent contractor would be

Mr. Frederick, inside of an agency

of the employee misconduct would go to an ordinary manager

Does it ever happen that the agency

MR. FREDERICK:

Certainly, but that also does

not transform -QUESTION:

It's not an order, but I guess the

agency can request it.
10

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, just as an agency head has

11

requested the FBI to conduct an investigation too, and

12

that doesn't transform the FBI into a representative.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And I guess the agency head has to

order the employee to appear and be available.

That's correct, which further

indicates the insulation of the Inspector General's

as an Inspector General who finds evidence of wrongdoing

be stronger if he did have that authority.

The dispute that had arisen had blocked the FBI basically,

Mr. Smith, you mentioned NRC, and

Judge Kravitch thought that the Eleventh Circuit decision

MR. SMITH:

6

That's correct.

I take it that

The Fourth Circuit

held that bargaining on the Weingarten right to enhance it

8

over and above the basic representation right was

9

improper, but the Fourth Circuit noted that its position

was consistent with the Third Circuit.

Judge Kravitch in the Eleventh Circuit agreed with as

their job is in jeopardy for refusal to participate or

And the compulsion

Moreover here, we have a situation where an

agency routinely utilizes the information that's gathered

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

Thank you, Mr. Kirsch.

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Kennedy, I'd like to

21

return to your question about who the IG reports to

22

because Executive Order 12993, which is not cited in the

23

briefs, provides that the President shall engage a process

24

to investigate wrongdoing by an Inspector General.

25

those instances when the Inspector General and the agency

head are at loggerheads, pursuant to this delegated

2

authority, the deputy of the Office of Management and

3

Budget convenes a committee called the President's

4

Committee of Integrity and Efficiency.

5

The PCIE investigates outside the realm of the

6

agency whether or not the Inspector General has committed

7

any wrongdoing, and pursuant to that process, the agency

8

head is basically taken out of the disciplinary process

9

through the investigation of whether or not the IG has

10
11

committed wrongdoing.
So, in answer to your earlier question, the IG

12

really reports not only to Congress through those

13

mechanisms created in the Inspector General Act, but also

14

to the President who has the authority to appoint and to

15

remove and to create this mechanism for the discipline of

16

the Inspector General.

17

and independence of the Inspector General in performing

18

its function.

19

That creates a further insulation

I would also like to point out that the remedy

20

that the FLRA asserts in this case runs against the agency

21

and the agency, therefore, has to be able to have the

22

authority to direct the Inspector General to comply in a

23

certain way.

prerequisites of the Inspector General Act which provide

25

for investigative independence on the part of the

Allowing a union representative in these

contexts allows the union representative to serve as an

Inspector General might ask not only of the worker who is
