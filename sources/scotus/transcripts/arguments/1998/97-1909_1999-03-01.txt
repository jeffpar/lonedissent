ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH A. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SMITH:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the 30-day

12

time period for removal begins to run when a named

13

defendant receives a copy of the complaint if service of

14

process has not yet been perfected.

15

28 U.S.C. section 1446(b) requires that notice

16

of removal be filed within 30 days after the receipt by

17

the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of

18

the initial pleading.

19

the words, receipt through service or otherwise, the

20

Eleventh Circuit held that the removal period commences

21

when a named party comes into possession of a copy of the

22

complaint, even if service has not been made.

23

Relying upon the plain meaning of

We submit to the Court that, when read as a

24

whole and in conjunction with the other removal statutes,

25

section 1446(b) is ambiguous.

The ambiguity arises from

1

the use of the term, defendant.

A defendant can mean

2

either a named party, a party who is named as the

3

defendant in the complaint, or it can mean, in more proper

4

sense, one who has been made a party defendant through

5

service of process.
In section 1441(b), Congress used the term

6

7

defendant in the narrower sense.

8

parties in interest -- or uses the phrase, parties in

9

interest who have been properly joined and served as

10

1441(b) states that

defendants.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. SMITH:

13

QUESTION:

That'S 1441(b)?
Yes, sir.
And in what part of -- it's a short

14

section, but I didn't immediately follow where you were

15

getting the language from.
MS. SMITH:

16

In 1441(b), the second sentence

17

states that any such action, any other such action shall

18

be removable only if none of the parties in interest

19

properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of

20

the State in which such action is brought.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

Do you think that's a definition of

MS. SMITH:

I think it is -- I don't think it

defendant?

24

is - - was intended as a definitional provision.

25

it is a demonstration that Congress was using the term

I think

1

there in a narrow sense, and suggests that perhaps

2

Congress was using that term in a narrow sense in section

3

1446(b) as well.
QUESTION:

4

I don't see why it's being used in a

5

narrow sense.

It would have been used in a narrow sense

6

if 1441(b) had just said, persons who are defendants, and

7

the very word defendants would embrace the terms, have

8

been properly joined and served.
MS. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, I -It didn't -- Congress didn't think

11

that the word defendant automatically embraced those

12

terms, and therefore it said, who -- people who have been

13

joined and served as defendants.

14

helps your case more than hurts it.
MS. SMITH:

15

I'm not sure that it

Well, I think it - - I disagree with

16

you.

17

demonstrates that Congress felt a need to articulate in

18

what sense it was using the term, defendant, in

19

recognition that a defendant as -- in common usage a

20

defendant can mean, anybody who is named as a defendant in

21

a complaint, and doesn't necessarily infer only a

22

defendant who has been properly joined.

23

I think it does help, because I think it

QUESTION:

But your argument has to be based on

24

the proposition that Congress was using the term,

25

defendant, in 1441(b) in the same way it was using it in

1446(b).
MS. SMITH:

2

Well, our argument is that it

suggests, by the use of the term defendant in 1441(b),

4

suggests that Congress was using the narrow term defendant

5

in 1446(b)

6

in the term.

as well.

QUESTION:

7

I think it demonstrates the ambiguity

But then why didn't -- if you're

8

right, why didn't the Congress use all the qualifying

9

language from 1441(b)
MS. SMITH:

10

it

in 1446(b)?
Well,

in 1441(b) we're dealing with

11

more than just parties who are named as defendants,

12

because we're talking about parties in interest, and that

13

could possibly be someone other than someone who has

14

actually been named as a defendant in the complaint.
QUESTION:

15

Even if I -- I'm not sure I agree

16

with you,

I think for the same reason that Justice

17

Scalia's question suggested, but assuming that I do agree

18

with you for the sake of argument,

19

problem with your position, and it's because of the usage

20

of defendant in 1448.

21

individuals who are defendants in a case that has been

22

removed may not yet have been served, and therefore,

23

1448,

24

of somebody who is simply called that in the pleadings,

25

whether or not served, and that's the sticking point that

I still have a serious

I have.

3

How do you explain how I could accept your
position for 1446, given the language of 1448?

4

MS. SMITH:

Well,

I think you're correct.

I

5

think in 1448 Congress was using the term in the broader

6

sense,

case had been removed and either the defendant who removed

8

it had not been properly served, or where there were other

defendants - -

in recognition that there would be cases where a

QUESTION:

13

MS. SMITH:

Or had not been served at all.
-- who hadn't been served at all.
Or had not been served at all.
I think it is a recognition that

14

that can happen, but it just -- it further demonstrates to

15

me the ambiguity of the term defendant.

16

QUESTION:

Well, assuming that is the case,

17

doesn't it also demonstrate that in 1446 Congress could

18

not have been using defendant in the narrow sense,

19

that which -- sense that requires service, as part of the

20

meaning of the term?

21

MS. SMITH:

i.e.,

I don't think so, because even if we

22

assume that a defendant can only remove,

23

couldn't be an early removal by a defendant who received a

24

copy of the complaint, decided to go ahead and remove it

25

even though his time had not begun to run under a service

that there

interpretation.

2

there are cases where a defendant's time begins to run

3

because he has been served with process, and there are

4

other defendants in the suit that haven't been served, so

5

1448 deals with those other defendants who have not been

6

served.

7

Aside -- taking that instance aside,

QUESTION:

But it does use the word, the bare

8

word defendant, and there's every indication in our

9

Pullman case that we understand 1448 to apply to someone

10

who is named as a defendant but not yet served, as it

11

states on its face.

12

13
14

MS. SMITH:

I think 1448 does apply to someone

who has been named but not served, but -QUESTION:

17

MS. SMITH:

That rule deals with removed

Your Honor, 81(c) is a - - poses a

18

real significant problem if the language, receipt through

19

service or otherwise, means receipt without service.

20

QUESTION:

MS. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

It uses the same language.
Yes, it does.
Receipt through service or otherwise

23

of a copy, and says that in a removed action in which the

24

defendant has not answered, the defendant has 20 days to

25

file a response, basically.

1

MS. SMITH:

Correct.

If -- and that language

2

was added to Rule 81(c) contemporaneously with the

3

amendment of 1446(b) for the purpose of consistency, so it

4

certainly should be interpreted to mean the same thing.

5

If it means only receipt in the absence of service, then

6

it puts the defendant in the position of having to

7

respond, not just remove the case without service but

8

respond to the complaint without service.

9

QUESTION:

If you're right, Ms. Smith, that

10

there is an ambiguity, then how do you interpret the

11

meaning of the word, or otherwise, after the word, through

12

service, in 1446(b)?

13

MS. SMITH:

I believe that the idea that

14

Congress was trying to set forth was that in a State where

15

the complaint is served with the summons your time runs

16

from receipt through service.

17

do not receive the complaint with the summons, then it

18

runs from receipt by some other means.

says it should then run from the date of service.

2

MS. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well -And if that's true, there's nothing

left for the other one.

5

MS. SMITH:

Well, the second clause in 1446(b)

6

was added to deal with a peculiarity in Kentucky where the

7

complaint is filed in court, but it never has to be served

8

on the defendant.

9

QUESTION:
MS. SMITH:

10

Right.
So if they didn't put in a specific

11

provision, the defendant's time in Kentucky would never

12

begin to run, because he never would receive a copy of the

13

complaint, or it could, that situation could occur, and

14

that is the purpose of adding that language to the second

15

phrase.

perfected without filing or serving a complaint --

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. SMITH:

-- but ultimately a complaint had to

4

be filed and served.

The defendant ultimately did receive

5

a copy of the complaint.
QUESTION:

6

That's like --

But wouldn't the second clause cover

7

there rather than the first, even in New York, because if

8

the -- oh, you're saying the complaint need not be served

9

for a long period of time but must ultimately be served,

10

but it would have been filed at the time the suit was

11

filed, wouldn't it?

12

MS. SMITH:

13

QUESTION:

14

No.

No.

In - -

You mean you can file suit without

ever filing a complaint?

15

MS. SMITH:

That's right.

You institute a suit

16

by filing a summons, and I think the procedure has changed

17

now, but at that time you instituted a suit by filing a

18

summons and serving it on the defendant, without any

19

requirement that the complaint be filed or served, so the

20

difference is, in Kentucky a defendant could go to the

21

courthouse and get a copy of the complaint.

22

the complaint wasn't necessarily there for the defendant

23

to go get it.

QUESTION:

In New York,

It wasn't even filed in the Clerk's

Office?

MS. SMITH:

1

It did not have to be filed in the

correct.

You can

Well, I think that the problems in

interpreting the or otherwise language are much less

10

significant if service of process has already been

11

perfected, because then you don't have the same kinds of

12

concerns about whether the defendant has actually gotten

13

notice that there is a formal proceeding against him.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but I was wondering if the or

think that's a proper interpretation by reason of, who is

QUESTION:

But if there were service -- I mean,

I suppose the hypothetical case that this applies to is

one where the service of the summons comes at a different

there are any -- they don't do that any place, do they?

statutes were -- Title 28 was reconfiled and revised in

3

1928 -- in 1948, excuse me, they specifically tied the

4

removal time to State rules of service and commencement,

5

so I think any suggestion that they were trying to divorce

6

the removal statutes, or the removal procedure from the

7

State rules of service is incorrect.

8

tied it to that in 1948.

9

And in 1948, when the

They specifically

In 1949, they were trying to only correct this

10

very specific problem of a defendant who had been served,

11

the suit had been commenced, but he didn't have any means

12

of determining whether his suit was removable, and that is

13

the problem that they were trying to correct.

QUESTION:

Ms. Smith, may I ask you another

15

question?

is governed by Federal law or State law?

17

Do you think the word defendant is a term that

Supposing the State had a statute that said, a

18

person becomes a defendant as soon as he -- one State has

19

a statute that says a person is a defendant when the

20

complaint is filed.

21

a person is not a defendant until he's served with

22

process.

23

MS. SMITH:

Another State has a statute that says

I think it is an issue -- for 1446

24

purposes and for removal purposes it is an issue of

25

Federal law, who is a defendant under Federal law.

QUESTION:

1

So that even if a State had a statute

2

that said, you are a defendant when the complaint is

3

filed, that would not be controlling --

4

MS. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

6

I think that's --- and I suppose your opponent would

make the same answer with respect to the other statute.

7

MS. SMITH:

Well, I mean, what we have to look

8

at is who is a defendant under 1446(b), and that has got

9

to be an issue of Federal law.

Requiring both service and

10

receipt is consistent with fundamental fairness.

11

it voids a lot of difficult interpretive problems that

12

result from solely a receipt rule.

13

It is --

The lower courts have begun superimposing the

14

service-type ideas on top of the term receipt in order to

15

deal with the concerns about whether the defendant has

16

notice, the proper notice in order to put him on notice

17

that he needs to do something in respond to the - - in

18

response to the complaint when he just receives it by fax

19

or by mail without the formal procedures attendant to

20

service of process.
We submit to you that that approach makes no

21

22

sense, because if Congress did, indeed, intend receipt to

mean any receipt, then superimposing service rules on top

1

Is it clear under this statute that

2

the complaint has to be filed in court, or can it just be

MS. SMITH:

I think that that is tied to the use

5

of the term initial pleading.

State courts, and I do not know if there was some State

It's just lost

that limited, waivable right to an alternative form.
Now, the assertion that the 1949 amendment was a
major change, and in fact the Senate report refers to it
as a major change, is consistent with a longer view of the
legislative history of the removal right.
In the earliest years, a defendant could
exercise that right all the way up until the time of
trial.

It was there because of the perception of local

prejudice.
Down through the years, as the perception,
hopefully reality of local prejudice abated, Congress has
consistently drawn back the time in which that right must
be exercised.

I'm beginning to see what I think I missed before.

You say that the case has to have begun, so that if, in
fact, the defendant gets a copy of the complaint, but gets
it before there's been any filing in court, that nothing
happens, it's void, it doesn't have an effect, but there
has to be a case that's begun.
Now, once that case has begun, in your opinion,
the copy that he has has to be a copy that he knows is
official, and if he's received through service of process

If he hasn't received that, then if the complaint

2

is time-stamped by the court, that will give him the

3

necessary notice that it's official.

MR. PUGH:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

QUESTION:

That's your point.

MR. PUGH:

Precisely.

QUESTION:

Now, I come from a State that Justice

Breyer alluded to in an earlier question in which the

agree the word defendant is a matter of Federal

2

definition, not State, so that even if there are State

3

statutes that said, you don't become a defendant until

4

you're served, we would ignore that State statute.

5

MR. PUGH:

My inclination, without thinking

6

about all the possible ramifications, is that we are

7

talking about the Federal right of removal, a limited,

8

waivable right, and if we have to construe that word for

9

purposes of determining whether a receipt has occurred, I

10

would be inclined to go with the Federal definition.
QUESTION:

11

If a lawyer for a prospective

12

defendant finds out a complaint's been filed and gets it

13

for his own client and sends it to him, I suppose he could

14

be in big trouble under your interpretation.

15

MR. PUGH:

It would depend upon how far the

16

district courts would go in interpreting receipt.

17

suggested in our brief that that implies an affirmative

18

act.

19

We had to address the hypotheticals.

We

The facts

20

in our case do not involve that, but we suggest it implies

21

an affirmative act on the part of the plaintiff, not

22

unlike an attempt at service, but it's not necessary to

23

reach that.

certified copy of the complaint, that's not enough.
MR. PUGH:

2

In fact, that's what happens in a

3

State like Kentucky.

The -- it's incumbent upon the

4

defendant to go and see if the pleading states a removable

5

cause of action so that he may then exercise his removal

6

rights if they're proper.
Again, the import -- what Congress recognized in

7
8

1949 and has echoed in both the Senate and the House

9

report, is that we've got a parade of horribles with the

10

service of process hypotheticals just as you can imagine

11

under the receive analysis, but we're going to abandon

12

that service of process methodology, because that is

13

clearly tied to 50 different States' rules.
We're going to adopt a new methodology, and

14
15

that's going to be based upon receipt of an initial

16

pleading that sets forth a removable cause of action,

17

because our intent in 1446(b) is to get notice to that

18

defendant that it had better do something or risk waiving

19

its removal rights, and that, at least the 1949 Congress

20

thought was best achieved by requiring receipt, and moving

21

away from the service of process, a phrase that it dropped

22

entirely.

23

It had been the sole methodology in the statute

24

the year before, and it moved away.

25

Congress intended to do was to solve the New York/Kentucky

problem, a semicolon provided comma however clause at the

2

end of the 1948 statute would have been the best manner,

3

saying provided, however, that in those States in which a

complaint, an initial pleading setting forth the removable

cause of action, is not required to be filed or served

until later.

Then the time will run when that is

It's just -- it's erased, and they

Well, it's not resolved if the

defendant's lawyer goes -- as Justice Kennedy's example.

It's not resolved for my case of a copy mailed before the

case is filed at all.

MR. PUGH:

They're still open.
Again, we think the initial pleading,

that the action actually be commenced.

For example, a foreign corporation, a defendant
