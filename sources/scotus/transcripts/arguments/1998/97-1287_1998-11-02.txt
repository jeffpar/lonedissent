ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. CAPPUCCIO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The nub of this case, I believe, is that the

11

12

post termination surplus asset allocation rules buried in

13

section 1344(d) of ERISA cannot become the tail that wags

14

the rest of the statute.

15

entitlement that restricts the legitimate uses to which

16

surplus plan assets, or any plan assets, can be put, but

17

that is how the respondents would have it in this case.

18

The respondents do not contend that they have

19

not received every benefit that they were ever promised

20

under the Hughes pension plan.
QUESTION:

21
22

This is a defined benefit plan, Mr.

Cappuccio?

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

QUESTION:

Those rules do not create an

Yes, Your Honor.

And your point is that they have

received the benefits defined under the plan?

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In

2

a defined benefit plan, the employee takes no risk that

3

the plan will not perform well.

4

guaranteed from day 1, Justice O'Connor, that he or she

5

will receive fixed benefits that are at least equal to all

6

of his or her contributions.

QUESTION:

Rather, the employee is

And I suppose under that plan there

might be a deficit instead of a surplus.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:
Your Honor.

There certainly may well be,

That's absolutely right.

QUESTION:

And the theory of the court below, if

there were a deficit, would be what?
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

I think the theory of the court

14

below would be that the employer would have to make up the

15

difference, which is, in fact, how a defined benefits plan

16

works, so I think what your question points out, Your

17

Honor, is the theory of the court below in a sense creates

18

a defined contribution plan with a defined benefits floor,

19

which as Judge Easterbrook - -

20

QUESTION:

Are these defined benefit plans

21

becoming used less often in today's world?

22

they almost extinct as a species, or still exist?

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Is this -- are

I think they're still very much

24

around, Your Honor.

25

towards defined contribution plans, and also to move away

I think the general trend is to move

1

from contributions to defined benefit plans, and I think

2

the reason for that is as a general sense today that

3

employees want to invest their own money.

4

this case Hughes has a 401k plan, so if they're not

5

contributing they can take that extra money and put it

6

into the 401k plan, and --

8

QUESTION:

For example, in

If this were a voluntary plan, then

would the employees be entitled to all the benefits?
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

9

There is a provision in section

10

1054 of ERISA that provides if you are allowed to make

11

voluntary contributions over and above the mandatory

12

contributions, that you vest in those also, but here the

13

contributions are mandatory.

14

QUESTION:

The mere fact that at --

They're man -- after the amendment

15

they were not mandatory because you could go to the other

16

side.

You could go to the other side of the plan.

17

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

I would disagree, Justice

18

Kennedy.

19

whether or not -- which plan to be in doesn't then make

20

the contributions voluntary once you select that plan.

21

mean, it's voluntary only in the distant sense that you

22

could decide to be an employee or not an employee.

23

doesn't

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

-- directly, and that is that

13

it's alleged in this case that somehow a factual issue has

14

been raised because one of our employees at one point

15

referred to this as the new plan, okay.

16

People speak in colloquial terms all the time, I

17

think that's a good thing, and people use the word new

18

when they mean amended.

19

the slip here at the podium, Justice Stevens, but when I

20

was preparing for this case I wanted to see what ERISA

21

said before and after the 1986 amendments, and I said to

22

my associate, can you get me the statute, and he said to

23

me, well, here's the old statute, here's the new statute,

24

and I said, well, it's a good thing we're not in the Ninth

25

Circuit.

I had that -- not only have I had

You would have just created a question of fact.

1

But I think the point is is that 1) we're not

2

bound by colloquialisms like that, and second, people say

3

new when they mean amended all the time, and the case

4

can't turn on that.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if you could change from the

6

contributory to the noncontributory at any time, then it

7

would look more like a voluntary plan.

8

9

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

the fact that you could even -- which is not this case,

10

that you could switch back and forth, would make the

11

contributions any less mandatory.

12

It would still, if you're going to participate

13

in this plan, they would be mandatory contributions, and

14

therefore under section 1053 and 1054 you would only vest

15

in your contributions plus the statutory interest rate and

16

not in all the upside, and anything else, Your Honor,

17

transforms this plan and any other defined benefits plan

18

into exactly what Justice O'Connor pointed to, which is a

19

defined benefits, defined contribution floor, a benefits

20

floor with a defined contribution upside, and that really

21

I think wrecks the basic dichotomy that is in the statute.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Cappuccio, is this kind of

23

amendment commonplace, or is it extraordinary, that you go

24

from a contributory plan to one in which there are no

25

contributions?

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

1

Justice Ginsburg, I think it's

2

quite common.

3

these days.

4

the union plan went, that the employer and the union in

5

the bargaining plan -- remember, we have the nonbargaining

6

plan here.

7

In fact, I think it's the usual amendment
I know in this case it's the same way that

In the other plan, the union and the employer

8

agreed to go from a contributory structure to a

9

noncontributory structure, and again, I think it's because

10

it's a sense by employers that they want to give employees

11

some choice in how to invest their money, and at least

12

when the stock market was doing well, that employees had a

13

lot of other options that they wanted to avail themselves

14

of.

15

Whether in light of the last, you know,

16

6 months, people are still going to be doing that, is

17

another question, but that just shows you that there could

18

have well been a downside here.

19

QUESTION:

You make the point that in amending

20

the plan you are not acting as a fiduciary and that what

21

Spink held, but is there any -- any control over what

22

legitimately constitutes an amendment to the plan?

23

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Justice Ginsburg, there's --

24

certainly to say that the -- the answer is yes.

25

say that the employer is not a fiduciary in amending the

(800) FOR DEPO

The -- to

1

plan is not to say that the employer has discretion to do

2

whatever he wants, whatever it wants.

3

The employer is still bound by the substantive

4

provisions of ERISA that apply whether or not one is a

5

fiduciary, which we would concede include the anti­

6

inurement provision here, and also the vesting and

7

nonforfeitures, forfeiture provisions and the asset

8

distribution provisions, so to say that one is not a

9

fiduciary here just means to say that the amendment must

10

comply with the rest of ERISA, but - - and to say but

11

there's no broader duty that exists out there.

12

And of course, if there were a broader duty to

13

plan participants it would be a sort of, a hopelessly

14

conflicting situation, right, because the employer would

15

be under conflicting fiduciary duties.

16

When we're deciding how to structure the benefit

17

program for active employees and retired employees, to

18

whom do we owe the fiduciary duty.

19

employees, to the retired employees, is it also to our

20

shareholders?

21

Is it to the active

You can't have that sort of conflicting

22

fiduciary duty, which is one of the reasons why this Court

23

held in Spink that in designing a plan or amending the

24

design of a plan the employer is acting as a plan sponsor.

CO?

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

2

I'm sorry.

Spink v. Lockheed,

3

which was decided 2 years by this Court, reversed in the

4

Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Cappuccio, am I right in my

6

understanding that there is no finding here that the

7

assets transferred for the benefit of the new

8

noncontributory option are themselves attributable to

9

contributions by the employees under the plan as

10

originally drafted?

11

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

12

there's no such finding.
QUESTION:

13
14

That's right, Your Honor,

What if there were?

Would your

position be different?
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

15

My position, Your Honor, would

16

not be any different, because my position is that this is

17

a defined benefits plan, and even if the employees had

18

made all the contributions, okay, the deal would still be

19

the same.

20

back at least those contributions plus a statutory

21

interest rate as a floor.

were set significantly higher --

They would be guaranteed that they would get

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

In fact, the defined benefits

to the surplus.

2

In my world, Justice Souter --

3

QUESTION:

They're guaranteed more than the

4

right of return.

They're also guaranteed the promised

5

benefits, which are a good deal higher than that.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

6

That's exactly right, Your

7

Honor.

8

contributions plus their rate of return, but --

9
10

I said that -- I misspoke, that the floor is their

QUESTION:

The floor of what must be guaranteed.

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

The floor of what must be

11

guaranteed, but in fact the defined benefits are --

12

although I don't have the particulars here are regularly

13

significantly above that.

14

Justice Scalia, the way I like to think about it

15

is, these people are promised, like, one or two standard

16

deviations off performance, or good performance, and what

17

they give up for that is the possibility of bad

18

performance, or three or four standard deviations, and

19

that's a perfectly fine deal and, frankly, it's one I wish

20

I had over the last 6 months.

21

QUESTION:

So basically, to use a term that has

22

come up in the briefs, I guess the only real difference

23

between this and an insurance policy is the consequence on

24

dissolution, on termination.

25

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Well, I guess I'd be somewhat

1

hesitant to say it's exactly the same, Justice Souter,

2

because, of course, an insurance policy is not backed up

3

by the Government, as this is here, and there are other

4

restrictions that ERISA places on the use of funds that I

5

believe are not on an insurance company, but with those

6

qualifications it would be similar, that's right.

7

Let me address just briefly the nonfiduciary

8

claims brought by the respondents, the claims that do not

9

depend on a fiduciary duty, the anti-inurement vesting and

10

11

post termination asset distribution claims.
We go over in the briefs that these fail for a

12

variety of reasons, but I'd like to focus the Court today

13

on I think what the one silver bullet is that will kill

14

every one of those claims without having to decide

15

anything else, and that is the one plan, two plan issue,

16

for unless the respondents can defend the holding by the

17

court of appeals that it's an open question of fact

18

whether there is one plan or two plans here, then all of

19

their claims implode.

20

Because, of course, if there's one plan here

21

there can't be any anti-inurement violation, if there's

22

one plan here, even if you let them prevail on their

23

ambitious duty to terminate claim, there can't be a

24

wasting trust, because people are still coming into the

25

plan, and they're vesting and forfeiture claim would also

fail.
Now,

2

the court of appeals held that it was a

disputed issue of fact whether it was one plan or two.

4

is not.

dissent, an erroneous conclusion of law disguised as a

6

question of fact.

It

That is, as Judge Norris pointed out in his

7

The relevant facts in this case are undisputed.

8

They are, what are the particular changes that Hughes made

9

to the plan, and the fact that at least on the face of the

10

documents those changes are structured as an amendment

11

rather than as a second,

separate plan.

Framed correctly,

12

the relevant legal question

13

becomes,

14

from structuring the transaction the way they did, and

15

deems what Hughes did two plans as a matter of law, and

16

the answer to that is plainly no.

17

pointed to anything in ERISA or anywhere else that would

18

limit -- that would prevent Hughes from doing this as an

19

amendment.

20

is there anything in the law that prevents Hughes

By the way,

Respondents have not

these are always done as amendments.

21

All one has to do is look at the plan in this case to see

22

that it's a series of about six amendments.

23

And to the contrary the Government has at least

24

two regulations on point that specifically allow a single

25

plan to have multiple benefit structures.

The Department

1

of Labor has a regulation to that effect, and the IRS has

2

a regulation to that effect, both of which are cited in

3

our briefs.
Indeed,

4

the same IRS regulation that allows

5

multiple benefit structures says that a plan is a single

6

plan when on an ongoing basis all of the plan assets are

7

available to pay benefits to employees who are covered by

8

the plan.

9

assets?

10

In other words,

is there a single pool of

I will defer to the Solicitor General's Office

11

on the reasons for the single asset test, but I believe

12

them to be that the Government thinks it's important to

13

focus on a single pool of assets for purposes of

14

determining whether the minimum funding requirements,

15

which are the real protection in ERISA, are met in any

16

case and also,

17

asset test furthers the important Government interest by

18

encouraging employers to do just what we did here, which

19

is to have multiple benefit structures with one single

20

pool of assets and thereby pool and reduce risk.

21

I would suppose,

that the single pool of

But in any event, whatever the reasons for that,

22

it's a Government regulation and under that Government

23

regulation we clearly have one plan here.

24
25

Now,

the rule advanced by the respondents as to

whether there's one plan or two plans,

that some lay fact-

1

finder from California, I suppose, years after the fact is

2

going to determine whether the changes to the plan

3

exceeded some unspecified level of significance, is, I

4

would submit, the worst and most destabilizing possible

5

rules.
It is not only inherently arbitrary, but it's

6

7

wildly destabilizing of our pension system.

It would call

8

into question as a possible anti-inurement violation any

9

routine amendment that the employer made either increasing

10

or changing benefits for some group of employees, or

11

adding a new category of participants.

12

It would thus deprive both employers and

13

employees alike of the very security that ERISA is

14

intended to encourage and promote and, of course, it would

15

become doubly destabilizing when combined with

16

petitioner's termination claim, since it could turn out

17

that years after the fact there was an unwitting

18

termination and suddenly people who thought they were

19

accruing benefits find out that they were not accruing

20

benefits.

21

Let me just very briefly, as I'm cutting into my

22

rebuttal time, address the termination claim.

Respondents

23

have completely abandoned the only termination claim that

24

they brought in their complaint.

25

complaint alleged that Hughes was in violation of ERISA's

Count IV of their

1

post termination asset distribution provision, section

2

1344, because Hughes had in fact "effective January 1,

3

1991" terminated the plan.

4

The court of appeals reversed the district

5

court's dismissal of that count on the ground that there

6

was a disputed issue of fact as to whether in fact the

7

plan had terminated in 1991.

8

9

In this Court -- I think it's very significant,
in this Court the respondents do not even attempt to

10

defend either the holding of the court of appeals, or the

11

count they brought in their complaint.

12

that the only way to have a termination, at least the only

13

means to have a termination, is through the procedures of

14

section 1341 and 1342 of the statute, and they concede

15

that no such termination has occurred here.

16

They now concede

They now contend that, quote, the relevant issue

17

for this Court is whether Hughes can be ordered on a

18

going-forward basis to use those procedures to terminate

19

the plan, but the respondents never brought any such duty

20

to terminate claim.

21

duty to terminate alleged, and nowhere in their complaint

22

is any cause of action to enforce that duty identified.

23

Nowhere in their complaint is any

Rather, the only claim that they brought was a

24

claim for a violation of the asset distribution

provisions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

10

MS. BLATT:

11
12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

13

I would first like to address the contention in

14

this case that Hughes created a new benefit structure that

15

constitutes a different plan under ERISA.

16

with that contention for two reasons.

17

in a Department of Treasury regulation, it is the position

18

of all three agencies responsible for enforcing and

19

administering ERISA that a single plan may contain

20

multiple benefit structures as long as all plan assets are

21

available to pay benefits to all plan participants.

22

We disagree

First, as reflected

That principle furthers ERISA's fundamental goal

23

that there is a restricted asset pool that is sufficient

24

and available to satisfy the employer's promise to pay

25

benefits.

The principle also reflects the employer's

1

general discretion over plan design decisions.

2

Second, the factual circumstances test advanced

3

by respondents would be unworkable, because it would call

4

into question any plan amendment that either raises

5

benefits for some but not all of plan participants, or

6

adds a new category of plan participants.

7

I would also like to address the issue of plan

8

termination.

9

respondents are entitled to receive both their promised

10

and vested benefits, and there is no allegation in this

11

case that Hughes has deprived any employee of those

12

benefits.

13

risk under the plan and must comply with ERISA's minimum

14

funding provisions.

15

As participants in a defined benefit plan,

Moreover, Hughes bears the entire investment

The security of respondents' benefits is also

16

protected by title IV's insurance program, but unless and

17

until the plan terminates under the exclusive means of

18

title IV, ERISA does not grant participants in a defined

19

benefit plan a right to a distribution of plan assets, and

20

because it's clear in this case that Hughes has not

21

terminated its plan, the plan is ongoing --

22

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Blatt, what do you make of

23

the apparently new claim asserted now that the court

24

should order a termination?

25

MS. BLATT:

Well, we don't think that there's

1

any basis for implying either the right or the remedy.

2

There's -- it's also our position that even if there was

3

such a basis for reading this common law doctrine into a

4

heavily regulated statute, this is clearly not a common

5

law wasting trust.

6

Under both benefit structures you've got tens of

7

thousands of employees accruing benefits, and that

8

unquestionably furthers the plan's express purpose to

9

provide pension benefits to eligible employees to

10

stimulate their interest in the company and also to

11

attract them, and far from -- what termination would do is

12

cease those accruals, and all those employees would be

13

without benefits and future accruals, and that would be

14

not only inconsistent with the purpose of the plan, it

15

would be very bad for the purpose of ERISA.

16

ERISA obviously wants to - - one of the important

17

purposes is to encourage the growth and maintenance of

18

these plans, and there are very, very specific provisions

19

in title IV when a plan can be terminated, and the

20

involuntary termination provisions of section 1342 set

21

forth the criteria for the Government to come in and

22

terminate a plan, and the whole point of even the

23

voluntary termination provisions in section 1341 are to

24

make it more difficult for employers to terminate.

25

Either the plan assets have to be sufficient to

1

pay benefits and all the plan liabilities, or they have to

2

demonstrate economic distress criteria, so it's a quite

3

comprehensive provision and even if there was some -- and

4

there's certainly nothing in the statute that says --

5

excuse me.

6

There's no violation that's alleged of the

7

statute that respondents would be trying to get a remedy

8

for, but even if assuming they had an alleged violation,

9

there's no remedy, and so we just don't -- and even if

10

there was a remedy, this wouldn't meet the criteria of a

11

wasting trust.

12

QUESTION:

I take it that your -- the position

13

of the Solicitor General is not significantly different

14

from that of the dissent, is it, Judge Norris' dissent.

15

Is there any difference?

16

MS. BLATT:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. BLATT:

Not that comes to mind.
No.

Thank you.

So basically our point is, it's a

19

good thing that this plan is ongoing, and as long as it's

20

ongoing, the plan assets are available to pay

21

participants, and if -- Justice Souter, if I could just go

22

back to one of your points on, if there's been a transfer

24

transfer of assets.

In fact,

the employer could raise benefits or

3

create an early retirement program like the employer did

in Spink and like the employer did here.
QUESTION:

5

Have there been any cases -- have

6

there been any cases in which amendments have been so

7

extensive that the Government has determined there are

8

really two plans?

9

that point?

Are there any regulations or cases on

10

No.

The restrictions on amendments

11

are similar to what Mr. Cappuccio said.

12

13

violate the anti- inurement provision, and then the key one

14

that's under the regulation is, you have to have a single

15

pool of assets that's available to pay all the benefits,

16

so you can't set up segregated asset pools, but I'm not

17

aware of any amendment that attempted to do that and call

it one plan.

7

as the benefits for the beneficiaries of the plan for

8

which the transfer had been made were covered.

MS. BLATT:

Certainly you'd have a case -- if

10

you've set up a separate plan and then merged them, you

11

would have that result.

little more complicated, because there are provisions in

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

9

MR. KUPFERBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The nub of this case, as Mr. Cappuccio put it,
is Hughes' use of the billion dollar surplus in the

10

contributory plan, which was funded in very large part by

11

the contributions of the employee participants, in order

12

to pay Hughes' separate obligations to a new plan as it

13

initially announced that it was establishing for a

14

virtually completely different group of employees without

15

hardly any overlap, paying completely different benefits.

16

Mr. Cappuccio in his remarks this morning again

17

referred to it as two plans, Hughes' announcement referred

18

to it as two plans, and announced that a new

19

noncontributory plan would be funded entirely by Hughes.

20

There was nothing wrong with creating a new

21

noncontributory plan for new employees and nonparticipants

22

in the old contributory plan, but that was a separate

23

plan, as Hughes itself said, to be funded by Hughes, and

24

not to be funded out of contributory plan assets.

noncontributory plan.

9

on page 26.

10

That's on -- in the joint appendix

It's paragraphs 27 and 30 of the complaint.

The nub of the complaint here is that Hughes

11

created a new noncontributory plan, announced that it

12

would be funded by Hughes and then, instead of doing that,

13

took money out of the contributory plan, which under

14

section 403, the anti-inurement provision of ERISA, must

15

be used solely for the purpose of paying benefits to

16

participants in the contributory plan, and is using it to

17

pay a separate obligation to nonparticipants in the plan.

MR. KUPFERBERG:

My answer, Justice Ginsburg,

is, even if the plan had said that, we would still see a

7

MR. KUPFERBERG:

Right.

Okay, and what else?
The Donovan v. Dillingham, and

8

there's a line of cases springing from that, recognize the

9

criteria for when a plan exists.

10

If all those criteria are different, just as if

11

you said the criteria for a piece of music are harmony,

12

melody, and rhythm, if the harmony is different, the

13

melody is different, and the rhythm is different, it's two

14

different pieces of music, and potentially if there was a

15

question of degree that could be decided by the fact­

16

finder in a copyright case.

17

Here, this is a motion to dismiss.

It is up to

18

the district court to hear and determine whether there are

19

two plans, as we contend, and we think the facts will

20

clearly demonstrate that.

21

The Department of Labor in an interpretive

22

letter, I -- although the Solicitor General obviously has

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. CAPPUCCIO

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

15

Very briefly, Justice Breyer,

16

our position of the Donovan line of cases is that first of

17

all it's a court of appeals case, and it only speaks to

18

the issue as to when a promise is sufficiently definite so

19

that it becomes a plan and is covered by ERISA.

20

not particularly helpful in determining whether there's

21

one plan.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Justice Scalia, or maybe Justice

10

Stevens, I forget, I forget who raised it, on the question

11

of who's a participant, for purposes of the anti­

12

inurement provision, at the very least that would have to

13

be governed by the statutory definition of participant,

14

not the definition in the plan.

15

I'm going beyond the briefs, because this point

16

hasn't been raised, but ERISA defines participant as any

17

employee or former employee who is or may become eligible,

18

so they are the same participants in this case, because

19

the nonbargaining employees, whether or not they ever

20

contributed, were always able to become eligible by

21

contributing, so for purposes of the statute it's the same

22

group of participants.

23

Now, I heard today yet another new claim for the

24

first time, which is that somehow this is a breach of

25

section 6.5(b) of the plan.

That was a claim not raised

since the eligibility requirements are

That's -- the sort of ultimate irony on the

claim would be that if it prevailed we couldn't pay

the respondents' benefits, because section 2.4 of the plan

16

excludes retired employees from the definition of

It would just be absurd.
