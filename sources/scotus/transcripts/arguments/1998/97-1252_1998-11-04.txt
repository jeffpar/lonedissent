ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress has legislated repeatedly to streamline

11
12

the process by which decisions concerning the admission

13

and removal of aliens are reviewed in the courts.

14

Consolidation of judicial review and avoidance of

15

piecemeal litigation have been integral features of past

16

legislative measures.

17

is Congress' most recent effort to achieve those goals.

18

The 1996 immigration reform statute

Our position in the present case, however, does

19

not depend on the existence of any special rule for

20

immigration matters.

21

of the 1996 act is simply to reaffirm the generally

22

applicable rule that the filing of administrative charges

23

is not a final agency action subject to immediate judicial

24

review.

25

Rather, as applied here the effect

Indeed, if respondents have identified no case,

QUESTION:

in which a

Mr. Stewart, may I ask you, what if

6

the statutory scheme precluded review of a constitutional

7

claim such as these respondents make?

9

MR. STEWART:

If the statutory scheme altogether

precluded judicial review,

that is not only at the present

10

time but after the entry of a final order of

11

deportation --

12

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. STEWART:

-- the Court has held that

14

preclusion of all judicial review would raise a serious

15

constitutional question.

16

QUESTION:

That's not the same thing as - -

We don't know at this juncture if

17

your interpretation of the statute is correct.

18

mechanisms exist for review of their constitutional claim?

19

MR. STEWART:

What other

Well, we certainly know that there

20

has always -- both before and after the 1996 act there has

21

been a provision authorizing a petition for review in the

22

court of appeals after the entry of a final order of

23

deportation, and I think there's general agreement that a

in their case.
MR. STEWART:

2

And if the -- if there were

3

ultimately final orders of deportation entered, and the

4

respondents raised a constitutional challenge based on

5

selective enforcement, and if the court of appeals then

6

concluded that fact-finding was necessary in order to

7

resolve the constitutional issue,

8

required to determine whether a mechanism existed under

9

the applicable statute.
Now, we believe 28 U.S.C. 2347(b)(3) would

11

it would then be

provide that mechanism, but -QUESTION:

12

It might provide the mechanism if the

13

issue is properly raised, but can the issue be properly

14

raised when it would not be based on anything in the

15

record of the proceedings at the administrative level?
MR. STEWART:

16

I think it would be properly

17

raised in the sense that the respondents would claim that

18

execution of - - if the respondents claimed that execution

19

of the deportation order would violate their

20

constitutional rights because the charges were initiated

21

on the basis of unconstitutional considerations,

22

that is a claim that would properly be before the court of

23

appeals.

made about the legal position that the Government would

2

take in those circumstances?

3

MR. STEWART:

That is correct.

That is not to

4

say that we would concede either in the present case or in

5

any other case that fact-finding actually is required in

order to determine the merits of the claim.

QUESTION:

may properly be raised.

MR. STEWART:
QUESTION:

10

That's correct.

Well, Mr. Stewart, these cases were

11

pending at the time of the enactment of IIRIRA, were they

12

not?

13

MR. STEWART:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's correct.

So isn't the habeas corpus relief

provided for in 1105(b) available?

former statutory scheme was only in cases of orders of

1

custody before they're -- you can't deport them without

2

having them in custody.
MR. STEWART:

3

Well, the only -- the basis for --

4

if you look at page la of the appendix to the Government's

5

brief,

6

generally Judicial Review of Orders of Deportation and

7

Exclusion, and it says, Exclusiveness of Procedure, and

8

then it says, the procedure prescribed by and all the

9

provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, which is the Hobbs

former section 1105a(a) was -- it's entitled

10

Act, says, shall apply to and shall be the sole and

11

exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final

12

orders of deportation heretofore or hereafter made against

13

aliens within the United States.

14

And as the legislative history of the 1961

15

amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act make

16

clear, that provision was enacted in 1961 to replace a

17

former system under which multiple avenues of review had

18

been available for challenge by orders of deportation.

19

QUESTION:

What's the purpose of 1105a(a)(9),

20

which talks about habeas corpus for people held in custody

21

pursuant to an order of deportation?

22

MR. STEWART:

I would assume that would address

23

the situation in which the alien challenged the detention

24

itself, perhaps because it was prolonged,

25

challenging the validity of the final order of

1

deportation, because as I say the legislative history of

2

the 1961 amendments to the INA indicate that the provision

3

for Hobbs Act review in the court of appeals was

4

specifically intended to replace prior duplicative avenues

5

of review.

6

QUESTION:

It's very bad English if that's what

7

it means, because it says any alien held in custody

8

pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial

9

review thereof.

Now, that thereof refers to an earlier

10

noun, and the only earlier noun available is order of

11

deportation.

12

MR. STEWART:

I think that is correct looking at

13

that provision in isolation, but I think that provision is

14

viewed in conjunction with (a)(1), which says specifically

15

that judicial review in the court of appeals under the

16

Hobbs Act is the only means of challenging the final order

17

of deportation itself.

18

And again, one of the things I'd emphasize is

19

that uncertainty as to what precisely would be the proper

20

avenue for reviewing the final order of deportation really

21

shouldn't distract the Court from the question of whether

22

the instant suit was properly commenced.

23

That is, even though there might be some

24

disagreement between the parties as to precisely how a

25

judicial review of the final order would be carried out, I

1

think there is a common agreement that final orders of

2

deportation are judicially reviewable.

3

QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that we have to

4

give meaning to a statute that is certainly ambiguous in

5

part as to how it works in the interim, period,

6

review is available of these constitutional claims, that

7

might influence our interpretation of the statute.

8

my concern.

9

MR. STEWART:

if no

That's

It might influence -- I think to

10

take a worst case scenario from the Government's

11

standpoint,

12

unambiguously foreclosed all judicial review of

13

respondents'

14

before or after the entry of a final order, and if the

15

Court held that respondents were constitutionally entitled

16

to judicial review so that the deprivation of all review

17

would be a constitutional violation, the Court would then

18

have to determine what the proper remedy was, and we would

19

submit that it is much more consistent with the overall

20

scheme of the immigration statute and with general

21

principles of administrative law that review be provided

22

at the end of the proces.

part on 2347(b)(3), and I understand you to say you think

2

that would be available even though there would have been

3

a hearing before the agency.
MR. STEWART:

4
5

Yes, because there would not be a

hearing with respect to the issues.
QUESTION:

6

On a particular issue,

on a

7

particular constitutional issue, so you say they -- now,

8

what is the legal effect of your advice to us on that

9

interpretation of 2347(b)(3)?

Would that preclude the

10

Department of Justice when the case actually reaches that

11

stage from making a contrary argument, do you think?
MR. STEWART:

12

I don't know that it would be

13

appropriate for a current Department of Justice employee

14

ever to purport absolutely to bind future Department of

15

Justice employees.
Certainly,

16

if the Court wrote an opinion saying

17

that the instant suit was barred based on its reading of

18

the statute to allow a judicial review at the end of the

day,

necessary assurance that review would ultimately be

available, whatever the binding effect of my

22

representation might be.

the Court's opinion would give the respondents the

the aliens, and that there was -- and if the Court further

2

concluded that the aliens were constitutionally entitled

to judicial review of their selective enforcement claims

such that a denial of fact-finding would be a

constitutional violation,

That seems to us a remedy for a hypothetical

9

the obvious remedy would be for

violation that is far more in keeping, again, both with
the overall structure of the immigration laws -QUESTION:

11

Do you think the Court could do that

12

if the Court concluded that it was constitutionally

13

compelled?
What if the Court merely concluded, as you sort

14
15

of admit as of now, that it's a very serious

16

constitutional doubt on the issue?
MR. STEWART:

17

I think if the Court concluded

18

that there is a serious constitutional doubt, then it

19

would presumably make every effort to read the statute in

20

order to allow for such review, and I think whether or not

21

our reading of the statute is the one that the Court would

22

consider to be the better one, our reading is certainly

23

reasonable enough that a court could in good conscience

24

adopt it in order even to assuage a serious constitutional

25

doubt.

QUESTION:

And your reading basically is, when

2

the agency has not held a hearing on the particular issue,

then (b)(3)

MR. STEWART:

And here it's not simply -- I

5

think that's right, but here it's not simply the

6

particular issue,

7

filing of charges.

8

enforcement claim would be a challenge to the decision to

9

bring charges in the first instance.

10

it is the particular action, namely the

QUESTION:

At the end of the day,

Well,

the selective

can we proceed on the

11

assumption that Mr. Cole and his clients cannot make in

12

the administrative proceeding the record and the showing

13

that's necessary for them to sustain -- support their

14

legal claim?

15

MR. STEWART:

I think we can make that

16

assumption.

18

claims of selective enforcement.

19

That is, the immigration judge and the Board

Now,

it is possible that in the course of trying

20

the deportation charges evidence would emerge that would

21

be relevant to the final resolution of the selective

22

enforcement claims, but I think it's correct we can't

23

count on that happening.

24
25

QUESTION:

And to the extent that there is a

temporal urgency to First Amendment claims, then we have

1

to proceed on the further assumption that a First

2

Amendment claim is likely to be delayed pending the

3

administrative hearings, the adjudication of the First

4

Amendment claims.

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, I mean, I think in a sense

6

your question depends upon the empirical premise that if

7

somebody files a lawsuit alleging selective enforcement,

8

that lawsuit is likely to be finally resolved before the

9

deportation proceeding would be resolved if the matter

10

went forward in that manner, so I don't know that it's

11

necessarily the case that allowing an immediate selective

12

enforcement challenge would speed up ultimate resolution

13

of the First Amendment issue.

14

But the second point we would make is that there

15

is no constitutional right to immediate adjudication of

16

First Amendment claims simply to eliminate subjective

17

uncertainty as to what a person's rights are.

18

That is, here, the respondents do envision a

19

potential concrete harm, namely the ultimate entry of a

20

final order of deportation against them, which they say

21

would be in violation of their First Amendment rights.

22

But to the extent that they're worried about

23

that harm, they clearly have an adequate remedy, because

24

they can file a petition for review of the final order of

25

deportation itself.

1

The only harm that they're suffering in the

2

interim is subjective uncertainty as to what the state of

3

the law is, exactly what they can do, which they

4

characterize as chill, and --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart,

I take it from

6

everything you've said here and in your brief that you are

7

accepting that there is such a claim as selective

8

enforcement, so that you are not urging in any way what,

9

for example,

10

11

this Court held in the Whren case,

that you

don't look behind what the officer does for his motive.
MR. STEWART:

I think we are accepting there is

12

such a thing as a selective enforcement claim.

13

think we would accept the principle that whenever a

14

selective enforcement claim is made out the automatic

15

remedy would be vacatur of the final order of deportation.

16

QUESTION:

I don't

Well, there's also a question of just

17

what is selective enforcement in an immigration context,

18

since the immigration statute itself is laced through with

19

distinctions as to nationality.

20

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

I mean,

in the

21

present case, at the time the initial deportation charges

22

were filed the McCarran-Walter Act made membership in

23

various forms of hostile organizations a separate and

24

independent ground for deportation, so the very basis of

25

selectivity that the respondents claim was

constitutionally impermissible was itself - recognized by

2

Congress as a valid basis upon which deportation decisions

3

could be made.
So while we could imagine extreme situations

4
5

such as the agency deciding solely on the basis of race to

6

file charges against one person and not another,

7

doesn't follow that what might be an impermissible basis

8

of selection in other contexts would be an impermissible

9

basis for selection in the -QUESTION:

than imagination?

been any past cases where it was charged that the

13

Immigration and Nationality Act was being enforced in an

14

impermissibly selective way against people of a particular

15

race,

16

Is there any experience?

Have there

religion, political belief?
MR. STEWART:

I don't remember any right now.

I

17

know that there was a challenge brought by a Mr. Rafidi in

18

the D.C. Circuit that was a challenge to the processing of

19

his deportation charges or exclusion charges.

20

remember whether that included a claim of selective

21

enforcement.

22

I don't

There has certainly not been a history of

23

frequent claims of selective enforcement.

24

the reason for that is that people understand that

25

immigration officials have very wide discretion,

1

matters regarding the admission and the ultimate removal

2

of aliens are largely entrusted to the political branches,

3

and therefore people understand that bases for selection

4

that might appear unwarranted in other contexts would not

5

be valid grounds for constitutional claims in the

6

deportation context.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Stewart, these particular

8

respondents, the deportation proceedings have been going

9

on for some time, have they not?
MR. STEWART:

10
11

How many years now?

Approximately, a little over

11-1/2 years.
QUESTION:

12

And do we still have all of the

13

respondents before us, or has the situation changed in 11

14

years?
MR. STEWART:

15

The situation has changed.

We

16

have referred to the eight respondents as the six and the

17

two.

18

permanent resident aliens as to whom the deportation

19

charges are actually based upon the terrorist activity,

20

the support of the PFLP.

21

The two are Hamide and Shehadeh, and they are

With respect to the six, actual charges were

22

based on routine status violations,

overstaying a visit,

23

failure to maintain student status, and the allegation was

24

that we would not have pursued those charges but for there

25

are ties to the PFLP.

With respect to two of the six, two of the six

1

2

have obtained legalization, and consequently they would

3

not -- they would no longer be subject to the routine

4

status violations, so in a sense their claim of selective

5

enforcement is moot.
Now, as the respondents' counsel has pointed

6
7

out,

there does remain at least a theoretical possibility

8

that we could seek to deport them based upon the actual

9

affiliation with the PFLP, and in that sense it's not

10

altogether out of the question that the issues raised by

11

this case could affect them, but --

MR. STEWART:

1

Because if you look at the

2

transition provisions, which are on page -- the bottom of

3

page 18a and the top of page 19a of the Government's

4

brief,

it says, general rule that new rules do not apply.
Subject to the succeeding provisions of this

5
6

subsection,

in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or

7

deportation proceedings before the title 3(a)

8

date, the amendments made by this subtitle shall not

9

apply, and the proceedings,

effective

including judicial review

10

thereof, shall continue to be conducted with regard to

11

such amendments.

12

QUESTION:

Without regard.

13

MR. STEWART:

Without -- I'm sorry, without

14

regard to such amendments, which means that if and when a

15

final order of deportation is entered against these

16

respondents, pursuant to the transition rule provisions,

17

judicial review of the final order of deportation would be

18

conducted pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. 1105a.
QUESTION:

19

Well, but that assumes -- it seems to

20

me you're reading (g) more broadly than it is written, as

21

though it applies to all proceedings, and I don't read (g)

MR. STEWART:

Well,

(g) by itself would not

24

necessarily be given that meaning, but if you look at the

What do you think (g) applies to?

It

I think that 1252(g)

Whether it's message is, even if a case is

says that for pending proceedings the new rules do not

succeeding provisions, which do not include (g)

9

a tension between that, which seems to say 1105a applies,

-- there's

18

19

removal proceedings under such act.

20

So the Government says that means Congress

21

intended one and only one provision of 1252 to apply to

22

pending proceedings.

23

We think that reading is untenable for a number

24

of reasons.

25

says that pending proceedings are covered by the old law

it's inconsistent with 309(c), which

subject only to the exceptions in the succeeding

provisions, of which (g)

Second, when you apply (g) without the rest of

3
4

1252 it becomes not an exclusion, an exclusive

5

jurisdiction provision, as it is denominated in the

6

statute, but a nullification of all jurisdictional

7

statutes, because it says, except as provided in this

8

section, which the Government concedes doesn't apply, and

9

notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall

10

have jurisdiction to hear any of these claims, so it

11

becomes a nullification provision -QUESTION:

12

That's why you can -- can't you read

it - - I mean, one way to read it is to say, very well, in

14

this odd transitional period Congress wanted no court to

15

have the authority to decide fact-based constitutional

16

questions.

17

That's very unlikely.
The other possibility is to say, well, what you

18

do with these transitional cases with fact-based

19

constitutional questions is, you apply the old statute.

20

Now, when you apply the old statute, you're

21

reading the statute in a way that again will reach the

22

result, no constitutional review, which might well make it

unconstitutional.

has admitted that it targeted people for their political

2

wouldn't that be a better way to do it?

3

MR. COLE:

I mean, whatever the shoulds are,

Well,

the problem is that the one

4

proceeding that the INS has put us in cannot consider

5

these claims.

6

longstanding interpretation and every interpretation of

7

the act prior to the '96 act can't consider that claim,

8

and Congress specifically thought about whether the court

9

of appeals should be given the right to consider that

The court of appeals, according to the INS'

10

claim in passing the provision with respect to

11

constitutional claims involving fact-finding, and they

12

rejected it and instead adopted language that says you

13

can't go to the court of appeals for this kind of claim.

14

And as this court has said,

it is a cardinal

15

principle of statutory construction that the court can't

16

adopt something that Congress has rejected in the process

17

of enacting another statute.

18

In addition,

the -- it is quite clear that the

19

background against which Congress was acting -- Congress

20

is presumed to know the law just as citizens are -- was

21

that these kinds of claims were brought in district court.

There has been other types of claims,

But again, it's a handful of cases out of

hundreds of thousands of deportation proceedings.

some huge problem that Congress, while considering

will assume that if he continues to engage in the activity

2

that the Government has said it does not like, that

discretion will be used in his disfavor, just as if the

IRS announced that they were auditing a newspaper because

5

of its Republican editorials, and they were auditing them

6

for 1 year, you'd say, well, how's that going to affect

7

the newspaper, because the audit is only with respect to

8

that past year.

9

Well, the IRS has a lot of discretion about what

10

it does with an audit, it could bring future audits, and

11

so the newspaper will be chilled until the court says that

it has the right to speak.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18

MR. STEWART:

I guess the first legal point I

19

would want to make is that we certainly disagree with the

20

contention that prior to the enactment of the 1996 statute

21

there was a consistent practice of allowing claims like

22

this to go forward.

23

The respondents have not identified any case in

24

which a court has entertained a selective enforcement

25

challenge to the filing of deportation charges.

That

1

would have been inconsistent with well-established

2

principles of administrative law that the filing of

3

charges is not final agency action.

4

Cases like Cheng Fan Kwok are cases in which the

5

Court has reviewed actions that took place outside the

6

deportation process itself and has held that those were

7

not subject to the exclusive review provision of former

8

section 1105a, but to say that simply by challenging a

9

nonfinal action an individual can have his claim heard

10

immediately really is not consistent with administrative

11

law principles.

12

The second point is that what is revealed

13

pervasively in the FBI reports is a concern that the

14

respondents were assisting in the raising of funds for a

15

foreign terrorist organization.

16

of surveilling the respondents the FBI came upon other

17

PFLP-related activity other than the pure raising of

18

funds, but the court concern was with fundraising, so this

19

is very far afield from core First Amendment activity.

20

Certainly, in the course

And the last point I'd like to make is that for

21

respondents to claim that they have attempted at every

22

turn to seek expeditious resolution of this process is

23

simply untenable.

24

to get district court injunctions against the ongoing

25

deportation proceedings, they have sought successfully to

have stays entered in the immigration court itself to have

2

the proceedings put on hold until the conclusion of the

3

litigation.

4

There's nothing wrong with their doing it, but I

5

think the respondents have acted throughout the

6

proceedings on the assumption that their clients'

7

interests are served by protraction of the proceedings

8

rather than by speedy resolution.
