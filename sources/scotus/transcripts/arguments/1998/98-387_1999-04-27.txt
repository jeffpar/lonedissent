CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ENNIS:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Federal scheme at issue here is so riddled

12

with exceptions that it cannot materially advance the

13

Government's asserted interests, and it is insufficiently

14

tailored, because those interests could be advanced more

15

effectively by regulating the underlying conduct.

16

asserted interests are helping States that want to protect

17

their residents from exposure to advertising for gambling

18

activities and reducing the social costs of gambling, but

19

Federal law now permits advertising promoting Government

20

casinos, Indian casinos, race track and off-track betting

21

to be broadcast from within even States that have not

22

authorized those forms of gambling.

23

QUESTION:

The

Make the assumption, and it's an

24

assumption I'm sure you would disagree with, that Congress

25

could prohibit advertising for casino gambling, that

1

that's a stable category.

2

assume it's a stable category and you could pass a

3

regulation prohibiting all advertising for casino

4

gambling.

5

gambling is exempted?

6

jurisprudential reason for your objecting to the statute

7

if it has that exemption in it?

11

Why does the calculus change when Indian casino

MR. ENNIS:

8

You can tax based on casinos,

What's the theoretical and the

Well, first, Justice Kennedy, this

statute doesn't even prohibit all advertising for private
casinos.

It permits private casinos to broadcast -QUESTION:

This is a hypothetical case.

12

casino gambling advertising except for Indian.

13

not that case.

MR. ENNIS:

15

QUESTION:

17

This is

Just --

14

16

No

The reason -I just want to test the reason for

the exception.
MR. ENNIS:

The reason, Justice Kennedy, is that

18

the Government doesn't assert, and it's certainly not

19

obvious that there is any difference in the social costs

20

between gambling at Government and Indian casinos and

21

gambling at private casinos, particularly when the Federal

22

law allows the Government and Indian casinos to provide

23

the same game operated by the very same private companies.

24
25

QUESTION:

But can't the Government weigh on the

other side of that equation the fact that casino gambling

1

may be essential to the well-being of Indian tribes as a

2

source of income, whereas it doesn't have to weigh that

3

and say that's very desirable that private casino owners

4

have a similar source of income?
MR. ENNIS:

5

I think not, Chief Justice

6

Rehnquist, for two reason.

First, here, as in discovery,

7

the fact that there may be social benefits associated with

8

Indian and Government casino gambling has absolutely

9

nothing to do with whether the Federal scheme materially

10

advances the Government's interest in reducing the social

11

costs.

12

Second, even if there were such benefits, those

13

benefits would not satisfy the Central Hudson test under

14

the fourth prong, because the very same benefits could be

15

obtained by taxing private casinos and giving those

16

revenues to State governments or Indian tribes.

17

QUESTION:

Is there a more basic --

18

QUESTION:

Not if you don't have any private

19

casinos in the States where the Indians are located.

20

don't know what kind of a scheme you're envisioning.

21

MR. ENNIS:

I

Well, Justice Scalia, if the private

22

casinos are not in those States, those States are not

23

going to be that concerned about them, but if they are

24

there, they could be taxed by the Federal Government and

25

the proceeds distributed, so the social benefits argument

1

here, as in discovery, isn't sufficient.
In discovery, the Government made a very similar

2

3

argument.

They argued that it was okay to allow

4

distribution of newspapers but not of commercial handbills

5

because the newspapers had greater benefits, greater

6

social value, and the court rejected -QUESTION:

7

Is there a more basic First Amendment

8

argument, and that is that Congress cannot grant or

9

withhold the ability to speak based on the identity of the

10

speaker, or are you foreclosed from making that argument

11

because this is a commercial speech case?

12

MR. ENNIS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Kennedy -That's what I wanted to explore.
Justice Kennedy, I don't' think

15

we're foreclosed from making that argument because it's a

16

commercial speech case, but I think this case can be

17

decided on much easier and more straightforward grounds,

18

the basic prong three and prong four of Central Hudson.

19

This --

20

QUESTION:

Well, it's not really the identity of

21

the speaker involved here anyway.

They wouldn't allow

22

anybody to advertise gambling on behalf of the private

23

casinos, whether it's the private casinos themselves or

24

just some public interest group that's interested in

25

promoting gambling.

MR. ENNIS:

1

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

the

2

ban is a ban on broadcasters, not on the private casinos

3

themselves, but I took Justice Kennedy's question to be

4

that effectively they're banning the private casinos

5

themselves.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ennis, could -- I didn't mean to

interrupt you, if you're going on with him.

MR. ENNIS:

MR. ENNIS:

11

QUESTION:

Well -I've a question when you're done.
Justice Souter.
It's a nuts and bolts question.

12

Would you explain to me what the, just the legal

13

mechanism, the text, the regulation that results in the

14

scheme that you described in the yellow brief in which the

15

private casinos can advertise but there are certain

subjects they cannot advertise.

20

I understand they can't

I guess they can't give
How does that come

What's the scheme?
MR. ENNIS:

Just Souter, the answer to that is,

21

is that the statute itself does not prohibit all broadcast

22

advertising even of gambling activities.

23

prohibits broadcast advertising of, quote, games of lot or

24

chance, and the FCC, the implementing agency has

25

interpreted that for more than 12 years as if the

1

advertising does not directly advertise gambling

2

activities, then it's permitted under this Federal scheme.
Now, under that interpretation the FCC has

3
4

repeatedly ruled that even private casinos can broadcast

5

advertising in every State saying that they are a casino,

6

and that the odds for fun, winning a vacation and Vegas-

7

style excitement are high, but they cannot advertise -QUESTION:

MR. ENNIS:

11

It's only if they have the name

Only if they have the name casino,

Justice Stevens.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ENNIS:

Yes.
But virtually 98 percent of all

14

casinos have the name casino, and they could easily change

15

their name to come within that requirement.

16

But what they can't advertise is advertisements

17

showing or depicting the actual, specific games they

18

offer, or their payout percentages.

19

are treated differently from Government and Indian

20

casinos, which can advertise everything.
QUESTION:

22

23

In that respect they

So casinos are okay.

are not.
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, although the FCC itself has

acknowledged that even the word casino is itself, quote,

QUESTION:

If it's not in quotes, yes.

2

QUESTION:

Do you know just as a fact, there are

3

Yes.

about 36 or 37 States that allow casino gambling?

4

MR. ENNIS:

QUESTION:

MR. ENNIS:

No, Justice Breyer.
How many?
There are about 38 States that allow

7

State lotteries.

authorize private casino gaming, and there are -- there's

9

casino gaming authorized by Indian tribes in approximately

10

31 States.

There are about 12 States that now

I might -QUESTION:

So do the 12 that allow private, are

there Indian tribes in each of those, do you know?
MR. ENNIS:

I don't know.

There are Indian

tribes in many of those States for certain.

15

the exact number, but there's -- the Government's own

16

lodging indicates that as of 1996 there were 240 separate

17

Indian gaming facilities in this country, and that number

18

is growing rapidly.

19

QUESTION:

20

Mr. Ennis, is casino gaming different

from casino gambling?

21

MR. ENNIS:

QUESTION:

23

No.
I noticed in your brief you never

used the word gambling.

MR. ENNIS:

use gambling, but there's no material distinction, and I'm

not trying to --

Because I remember the first time I

came across it in a regulation I thought, oh, they're

regulating hunting.

20

QUESTION:

I think Congress doesn't really like

21

to authorize gambling, and the Indian Gaming Act has a

22

much better ring to it.

23

MR. ENNIS:

Well, Justice Scalia, that used to

24

be the case, but today Congress not only authorizes an

25

enormous amount of broadcast advertising for gambling

2

gambling itself by Indian tribes.

3

allows broadcast advertising for Indian casinos in every

State, in most States it requires the States to allow the

underlying Indian gambling itself.

In fact, Florida is

Mr. Ennis, I take it that part of the

8

Government's submission is that the bulk of gambling

9

occurs in private casinos if you view the problem Nation­

10

wide, and that the exceptions are only a small part of the

11

overall effect and therefore they say that the limited

12

prohibition of advertising in private casinos does

13

accordingly address the bulk of the problem.
MR. ENNIS:

14

Justice O'Connor, I think that's not

15

quite an accurate description of the Government's

16

position.

17

Government has not asserted a general interest in reducing

18

consumption of gambling or even of all private casino

19

gambling.

20

psychologically stable middle class gambler wants to spend

21

his or her money on that form of entertainment.

22

Government's concern is with reducing the social costs of

23

gambling, particularly by compulsive gamblers.

that's why they have this limited thing.
MR. ENNIS:

2

Well, Justice O'Connor, there is

3

really no reason to believe, and no evidence that

4

compulsive gamblers are more likely to gamble compulsively

in private casinos than they are to gamble compulsively

in

7

QUESTION:

Well, I think you miss the point.

8

They say the bulk of the gambling is in private casinos,

9

so we're hitting the bulk of the problem by this ban.
QUESTION:

10

They gave a percentage in their

11

brief, I forget, it was -- it was a surprisingly high

12

percentage.

Was it 80 percent is in private casinos?

13

MR. ENNIS:

Well, no, I understand --

14

QUESTION:

I thought it was 40 percent.

15

MR. ENNIS:

Now I understand what you're talking

16

about.

17

private casinos in 1996 may have accounted for 40 percent

18

of all gambling revenues, but if you look --

the study itself makes clear that casino there was

described very broadly, not just the land-based casinos

4

Yes, they are.
Well then, so why shouldn't they

I don't --

MR. ENNIS:

They -- I'm not arguing that they

5

should include it, Justice Scalia.

I simply want to point

6

out that same study shows that in the previous year --

7

this is from '95 to '96 -- there was a 3.3 percent

8

increase in all of that broadly defined private casino

9

gambling, whereas there was a 13.3 percent increase in

10

Indian casino gambling because in 1988 Congress authorized

11

and made Indian casino gambling legal, Indians have now

12

started to build and operate Indian casinos, and rapidly

13

Indian casino gambling is taking over the market.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose private casino gambling,

15

which is the target of the Federal regulation, accounts

16

for 90 percent of the gambling in the United States,

17

hypothetical case.

18

MR. ENNIS:

What would your argument be before us?
Well, my argument would still be the

19

same.

20

certainly would be the same, because this scheme, since it

21

permits so much other stimulation of gambling activity,

22

cannot materially advance the Government's interests.

23

have to look at what the scheme permits, not just the

24

current empirical reality of what's happening under the

25

scheme.

It wouldn't be as dramatic an argument, but it

1

Second, under the fourth prong of Central

2

Hudson, if private casino gambling is such a problem, the

3

Government can easily regulate private casino gambling

4

rather than ban certain kinds of advertising about private

5

casino gambling.

6

QUESTION:

But if we have a 40-percent figure

7

that we're working with hypothetically, it seems to me

8

that that's close enough for the Government's interest to
comply with Edge.

10

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I think that Edge is

11

really quite different in two important respects.

12

the prohibition on lottery advertising in Edge was

13

completely consistent with the quite different federalism

14

interests that the Government there asserted, evenhandedly

15

supporting both lottery and antilottery States, and any

16

ineffectiveness of the restriction was the result of

17

geographical happenstance, that the station happened to be

18

close to the State border, not of the conflicting

1

provisions of the scheme itself.

20

That's not this case.

First,

Here, the Government is

21

not asserting that kind of federalism interest.

Its

22

scheme overrides the federalism interests of States and

23

forces every State to permit broadcast advertising of

24

Government casinos, Indian casinos, and even promotional

25

advertising of private casinos.

Second, Edge involved broadcasting of an

1

2

activity that would have been illegal in the State where

3

the broadcast originated, thus arguably did not even come

4

within the protections of the commercial speech doctrine

5

to begin with.

here about advertising of lawful activities.

That is not this case.

QUESTION:

1

-- Mr. Ennis, one question first.

2

We've been talking so much about the exceptions, is it

3

your assumption that as a predicate for the whole argument

4

that the statute would be constitutional if it had no

5

exceptions?
MR. ENNIS:

6

Not at all,

Justice Stevens.

The

7

statute at issue in 44 Liquormart did not have a great

8

many exceptions, and it was found unconstitutional under

9

44 -- under the Central Hudson test.

Here's why.

Liquormart involved a prohibition of price advertising,

was axiomatic that eliminating a prohibition on price

Well, Justice Scalia, let me respond

6

by saying that I don't know what was in the minds of all

the justices in 44 Liquormart, but the opinion does

indicate two problems with that statute that are equally

9

present here.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ENNIS:

What opinion are you talking about?
I'm talking about the plurality

12

opinion and the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor,

13

particularly Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion makes

14

the point, which the plurality also makes, that even if

15

the restriction in 44 Liquormart would have materially

16

advanced the Government's interests, those interests could

17

be achieved more effectively by regulating the underlying

18

conduct, and therefore the scheme violated the fourth

19

prong of Central Hudson.

20

That's certainly true here.

Look at the possible regulations of conduct.

21

The Government could regulate private casino gambling by

22

imposing the same Federal regulations it now imposes and

23

considers adequate for Indian casino gambling, or it could

24

impose betting limits in order to reduce the problem of

25

compulsive betters, absolute limits.

What would you do if two States

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I think that

8

prohibitions of marijuana and other things would have to

9

be judged under the same statutory framework of the

10

Central Hudson test.

11

would depend on precisely what the Government's interests

12

are, how many exceptions there are, whether the Government

has tried regulating the underlying conduct in other

States and can't effectively do so --

20

I mean, is it up to the court to decide

MR. ENNIS:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, this

21

Court's commercial speech cases make clear that not only

22

can the court take the Government's word, it must take the

23

Government's word precisely, and cannot think up other

24

interests that might be stronger interests.

Here, the Government asserts an interest not in

reducing the gambling itself, even casino gambling, but in

2

preventing the social harms caused by compulsive gambling.
QUESTION:

3

So if the Government in its brief had

asserted that broad an interest, the case might come out

differently, it depends on what the Government says in its

brief?
MR. ENNIS:

7

Unfortunately, Chief Justice

8

Rehnquist, I think it does make a difference in how

9

different cases might come out, depending on the precise

10

interest the Government puts forward.

Then it's the Solicitor General who

that the Government litigation counsel can even posit an

let's say the realistic character of the asserted interest

not plausible to say that the Government's interest is

QUESTION:

Mr. Ennis, do I understand that your

argument essentially is, we can take as conceded, or that

you demur to -- first to the Central Hudson factors that

your case rests on the third and fourth, and because you

think you have a secure case under those, you don't have

to get into what some of the amici urge, that we depart

20

from Central Hudson and elevate commercial speech to a

21

higher notch?

22

MR. ENNIS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it is our

principal argument that this restriction fails prongs

plain that the case could and should be decided on that

But we also argue that this would be an

3

appropriate vehicle to resolve the issue that's been a

4

continuing issue among members of the Court.

5

this is an appropriate vehicle for the Court to say

6

unambiguously what it ruled in Virginia Pharmacy Board,

and that is that the First Amendment makes for us the

choice between paternalistic approaches and opening the

9

channels of communication when we're talking about

QUESTION:

What would that mean, for example, if

12

we were to take that broad a ground for advertising of

13

cigarettes and control of that?

14

MR. ENNIS:

Well, Justice O'Connor, under that

15

approach -- excuse me, Justice Ginsburg, under that

16

approach, advertising of cigarettes would be viewed under

17

the same scheme, which it basically be a, this regulation

18

is presumptively unconstitutional, and the Government

19

cannot survive scrutiny unless it meets something

20

equivalent to strict scrutiny.

21

But there may be compelling justifications for

22

regulating cigarette smoking, and it may be that is the

least restrictive way, given the fact that the Government

has tried alternative forms of regulating the underlying

Mr. Ennis, why is it that the

Government has to go all out, or else not at all?

in Liquormart, I frankly couldn't see how the Government's

scheme was going to do any good at all.
In this case, your argument is quite different.

I mean,

In this case, your argument is, this, the Government

11

from gambling, casino gambling advertising.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I'm not sure whether the dispute

is about the facts or about the way of characterizing

those facts.

6

7

also as they claim to do, when institutions operate as

8

hotels and restaurants and nightclubs, the FCC has

9

reasonably taken the position that their advertising of

10

those activities is not covered by the ban.
Now, there are cases that are close to the line,

11
12

because an enterprise that runs many different sorts of

13

activities and is prohibited from advertising its gambling

14

activities may well try, through its advertising of other

15

activities, to promote --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but it isn't even trying, is

it?

which I guess is legal, there isn't any mystery about the

3

If the word casino is used in connection with too many of

4

these, you know, you have a good chance -- too many words

5

connoting chance and luck activities, the FCC has said

6

that in fact constitutes an advertisement for casino

7

gambling, but of course, there are anomalies close to the

8

line.

9

QUESTION:

Couldn't one argue that it's somewhat

10

perverse to give free reign to the Las Vegas casinos to

11

advertise the fact that they are casinos, with the implied

12

message that it's gambling, but to prohibit them from

13

giving truthful information about what games are played,

14

what the odds are in their slot machines and all that sort

15

of stuff, which might actually be totally consistent with

16

the Government interest at stake here?

17

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I think this is quite

18

unlike the Liquormart and Coors problem, which is I think

19

the analogy that you are drawing, when advertising is

20

generally allowed and particular items are taken out in

21

order -- and the result is to make the market in

22

advertising less accurate, or less honest.

23

This is a situation where what Congress and the

that we're talking about arises because enterprises engage

in other activities as well and seek to market those

QUESTION:

There is one analogy with 44

7

Stevens pointed out, as long as the word casino is in the

8

title of the establishment that's doing the advertising,

9

everybody knows that it's casino activity which is being

advertised, but one of the things that advertiser cannot

11

do, as I understand it, is advertise his payout ratio.

12

That is, as Justice

He can't say, you have better odds, because the

13

payout ratio here is such-and-such, than you do in the

would take the position, the FCC would have taken the

position that an establishment that has the word casino in

without advertising casinos and everything that connotes,

but the Government doesn't take that position.

Would you respond to one other point

12

that was raised by Justice Scalia, actually, in the

question that he put to Mr. Ennis, and he said there's

14

another feature of 44 Liquormart that's not present here,

that, in effect, an interference with competition in the

MS. UNDERWOOD:

3

No.

It is principally a

4

decision by Congress to -- Congress identified a

5

particular problem, the problem of private casino

6

gambling, which is partly a Federal interest because the

7

States have independently, 38 of the States have

8

identified that as a form of gambling.
QUESTION:

9

Why is the problem in private casinos

10

different from the problem in Indian casinos?

I mean, the

11

only argument that I heard in the Government's brief was,

12

well, the Indian casinos tend to be off in the boondocks

13

somewhere, and people can't get to them easily, and so

14

compulsive gamblers don't resort to them that well.
Well, they may be out in the boondocks, but I

15
16

don't see that goes to the Government's interest.

17

see why that suggests that compulsive gambling isn't going

on in the casinos that the Government promotes and allows

to advertise as readily as those which are subject to

3

of its objectives is in fact to permit the States, the

minority States to make a different choice.

5

But its effort is to protect the choice of the

6

38 States that prohibit this activity as well as to pursue

7

its own overarching concern about the social costs of

8

gambling, and Edge did not require Congress to seek some

9

other way of serving that objective before passing the

10

statute that it passed there, which is related to this

one, but involves different treatment of State lottery

effective against the casual gambler, the person who's

going to be entertained, but the true drunk is going to

find the bottle, and if the bottle is there, whether it's

MS. UNDERWOOD:

9

That's so, yes, and, of course,

broadcast advertising, which has this broad interstate

reach, is completely beyond the regulatory power of the

intruding excessively on the choices of the States that

departments to use the airwaves to promote the bingo games

17

and raffles they use for fundraising.

18

pose the same kind of problem that the standing private

19

casino poses.

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That simply doesn't

Let me ask you one last question, if

21

you're -- you've just about run out of your argument.

22

Supposing a State prohibits the sale of liquor on Sundays.

23

Could it prohibit advertising of the fact that a

24

neighboring State has liquor stores open on Sundays?

25

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Could the State do that?

QUESTION:

1

Say Illinois prohibits the sale of

2

liquor on Sunday, but Indiana does not, could Illinois

3

prohibit Indiana advertise -- from advertising in the

4

Chicago radio stations and Chicago newspapers that their

5

stores are open?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

6

I think probably not,

7

particularly if you're talking about all advertising, but

8

if there were wide variation among the States on this

9

issue and Congress chose to enforce that variation through

10

a ban on broadcast advertising that left newspapers and

11

other methods open, I think it could do that.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Ms. Underwood.

Mr. Ennis, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ENNIS:

16

Mr. Chief Justice, I hope I have

17

time to make three brief points.

18

to a question raised by Justice Ginsburg, and that is that

19

the word casino clearly signals to compulsive gamblers and

20

noncompulsive gamblers alike that gambling activity takes

21

place.

22

the Federal scheme prohibited the hosting of alcohol

23

content on labels but permitted --

This is remarkably like the Coors case in which

Yes, but Mr. Ennis, you're not going

to convince me that you'd like the statute better if it

did not allow the use of the word casino.

MR. ENNIS:

Stevens, but that -QUESTION:

Not that I'd like it better,

Would it be okay?

Would it be

constitutional if they didn't allow them to use the word

9

No,

for other reasons, but

because -QUESTION:

10

MR. ENNIS:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. ENNIS:

There's no way out of this box.
But because this --

Not under this scheme.

Because in

13

Coors the Court said, allowing the use of malt liquor

14

signals high alcohol content, and that means it cannot

15

materially advance the Government's interest,

16

equally true with respect to the word casino.

17

that's

Second, many -- many Indian casinos, and a

18

growing number, are located close to population centers.

19

Harrah's operates an Indian casino in North Carolina, the

20

Edge state, which it advertises is within a day's drive of

21

half the population of this country.

Boston, closer than Atlantic City.

1

Third, this scheme cannot be justified on the

2

basis of the special characteristics of broadcast because

3

the scheme permits broadcast advertising in every State of

4

Government casinos, Indian casinos, and even private

5

casinos when they say, I'm a casino.

6

Furthermore, this scheme does prohibit print

7

advertising that uses U.S. mails, and Congress clearly

8

didn't think that broadcast was worse than print, because

9

violations of the print advertising ban, you go to jail

10

for 2 years for each offense, violation of the broadcast

11

ban, you go to jail for 1 year for each offense.

QUESTION:

Government casinos?

MR. ENNIS:

Mr. Ennis, how many States have

Four, as of this moment, Justice

15

Scalia, but that's a very recent trend, just in the last

16

year or so, and that's growing as well.

17

Justice Scalia, let me also point out, your off­

18

track betting, this scheme permits broadcast advertising

19

not just for race track betting but for off-track

20

simulcast betting, so that people can gamble every day,

21

day-long, and broadcast advertising is unlimited.

22

Finally, I just want to answer one question that

23

was asked, and that is, in both Coors and 44 Liquormart

24

this Court ruled that the availability of nonspeech

25

regulations meant that the scheme could not pass the
