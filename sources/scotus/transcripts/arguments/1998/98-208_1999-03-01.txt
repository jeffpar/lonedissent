ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The 1991 Civil Rights Act made several

12

fundamental changes in the method of enforcing Title VII

13

and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

14

authorizes awards of punitive damages if punitive or

15

compensatory damages are sought, and either party has a

16

statutory right to trial by jury.

17

Section 1981a(a)

The determination of whether punitive damages

18

should be awarded proceeds in two distinct stages.

19

Section 1981a establishes several statutory prerequisites

20

which must be satisfied before a jury or, in the case of a

21

bench trial, a judge, is authorized to consider an award

22

of punitive damages.

23
24
25

First,

Satisfaction of the statutory requirements only
permits, but does not require, an award of such damages.
QUESTION:

Well, is it your position -- and I

take it that it is -- that every case of intentional

2

discrimination should at least go to the jury on the

3

question of punitives?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

4

That is not our position.

Our

5

position is that there must be proof of either reckless

6

indifference or malice.

7
8

QUESTION:

And there are a number --

Well, does proof of intentional

discrimination suffice for a jury to find punitives?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

9

Not necessarily.

There are a

10

wide variety of circumstances under Title VII, as well as

11

the ADA, in which one might have intentional

12

discrimination, but not reckless disregard.

13

example --

MR. SCHNAPPER:

MR. SCHNAPPER:

1

But there

there could be

2

circumstances, as was true in the Hazen case, in which

3

the -- for example, the law was sufficiently unclear as to

4

whether or not a particular act of discrimination,

5

although technically intentional, was, nonetheless,

6

illegal.

7

there was a BFOQ exception under the ADEA, the same

8

exception as this --

The Court noted in Hazen, for example, that

So, it's kind of like qualified

immunity in a -MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

Well, it -- it's a little bit

analogous.

And I think the standard is not as -- as

13

stringent as for qualified immunity.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But --

But, Mr. -- I'm sorry -If -- if you had a situation in

16

which -- the standard that we propose with regard to

17

reckless indifference is that the defendant either knew or

18

should reasonably have known that what it was doing was

19

probably illegal.

20

intentional discrimination where you couldn't say that.
QUESTION:

21

Now, there are circumstances involving

Well, do you think that, just in

22

general, that Congress probably intended, as is normally

23

the case, to make it more difficult to get -- to be

24

entitled to punitive damages than to gain compensatory

25

relief?

1

The -- the statutory standard

as a practical matter, be satisfied by proof of intent,

Standard.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schnapper --

3

MR. SCHNAPPER:

If that's a question about --

4

about whether it was debated, I think I purport it was

5

not.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnapper, help me on one thing.

8

In order to be found liable for an intentional violation,

9

does the -- does the defend -- does it have to be shown

10

that the defendant was aware of Title VII, or is it

11

sufficient to show that the defendant discriminated,

12

intentionally discriminated, said, I am going to prefer a

13

woman because she is a woman?

14
15
16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It does not require any

knowledge of the law for there to be -QUESTION:

All right.

Doesn't the punitive

17

damage standard require knowledge of the law?

18

indifference to the defendant's rights.

19

that means rights under the statute.

20

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It's

And I presume

Yes, it would require either

21

knowledge or -- or, as the Court said, I think, in

22

McLaughlin, recklessness in determining what the

23

defendants knew their obligations were.

24
25

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, the -- so, the -- the

reference of the two standards are different.

With

respect to the intentionality that is required for
liability, all that has to be shown was that there was an
intentional discrimination, period.

In order to get

punitive damages, there has to be shown that there was
either knowledge or indifference to the -- the likelihood
of a statutory violation.

And -- and because you have to,

in effect, prove this reference to the statute, the
reference to the legal source of the rights, that is more
difficult, and that's why it makes sense to say that the
punitive damage standard requires proof of something more;
isn't that the key to it?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, then, if you're correct in

that, Mr. -- then it -- it bears a remarkable resemblance
to qualified immunity.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

The -- the -- the difference,

Your Honor, as we formulate the standard, is that the
knowledge required here is that the action is probably
illegal.

Under qualified immunity, there would have to be

a clearly established right.

So, that's a -- that's a

higher -QUESTION:

And you would cnarge -- you would

charge the jury to find whether or not something was
probably illegal?

I mean, you would have to, wouldn't

N,

2

you?

3

you would have to say, You of the jury, would you find

4

this was probably illegal?

5

If that's the test, and it's for the jury to decide,

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, if -- if there was a

6

question as to whether or not the action was probably

7

illegal, our view is that that would be a question the

8

judge would have to decide.

9

QUESTION:

But --

10

QUESTION:

Is the statute not --

11

QUESTION:

No, but you'd have to charge the jury

12

as to what the defendant knew, whether he thought it was

13

probably illegal --

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The defendant's knowledge or the

15

defendant's lack of care in ascertaining the law would be

jury questions.

intent to injure, or an attempt to violate the statute.

Those are the -- those are the concept of evil motive that

are in this Court's opinion in Smith v. Wade.

Our view is that malice can be

9

I would think that exists in most of the cases, doesn't

10

it?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

I think a desire that the victim

12

be injured is not necessarily present in -- in a case like

13

this, where the defendant has been found to have preferred

14

to hire -- to promote Mr. Spangler because he's a man.

15

That doesn't necessarily mean they wanted the -- the

16

plaintiff to -- to -- to suffer.

1

"may," and yet, not reckless indifference to the

2

plaintiff's federally protected right -- that's the

3

statutory phrase?

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

We've set out

5

in our briefs some 15 different kinds of circumstances in

6

which that might arise, simply on the face of the statute,

7

questions about whether the defendant, for example, under

8

Walters, was covered by the statute, questions about other

9

circumstances in which, for example, religion/conscience

10

decisions are legal under the statute for certain

11

defendants.

12

statutory issues that we noted there, there continue to be

13

issues that arise in the lower courts as to whether

14

particular practices which are intentionally

15

discriminatory are nonetheless legal under Title VII.

16

What --

17

And there are, in addition to the specific

QUESTION:

Well, I take it what Congress was

trying to do was to tell us that there are degrees of

culpability insofar as the defendants are concerned.

21

such as you have here, a corporate employer, has a -- has

22

an admirable employment policy and makes -- has very, very

2

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.

But let me -- let me

3

explain why I say yes to that with reference to the two

4

distinct stages of determination on punitive damages.

5

circumstances that you describe would not be relevant to

6

the statutory prerequisite, but they would be relevant to

7

the discretion the jury has to exercise in deciding

8

whether to award punitive damages.

9
10

QUESTION:

The

How does the -- how does the jury --

how is the jury instructed?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

Well, at this point in time,

12

with regard to the second phase, the -- the practices vary

13

quite widely as to whether juries are in fact given much

14

guidance as to how to exercise that discretion.

15

certainly it would be appropriate in the case that you

16

describe to advise the jury that that would be a factor

17

the jury could consider, and it would militate against

18

punitive damages.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnapper, what about -- what

about attribution?

2

MR. SCHNAPPER:

We don't believe so.

But I

3

should start by saying that's not an issue in this case.

4

In this case, the culpable officials included the

5

executive director of the defendant, the highest ranking

6

official they had.

7

QUESTION:

Well -- well --

8

QUESTION:

He's a proxy for the company --

9

QUESTION:

Well, it -- it's relevant to the

extent that -- whose -- whose mental condition you have to

look to -- Wheat, who is a lower one, or -- who was the

12

higher one, I forgot his name?

13

MR. SCHNAPPER:

14

QUESTION:

Allen.

Allen.

Yeah, Allen was the highest,

15

and he was the one that -- that did the -- the

16

non-promotion.

17

would instruct the jury differently as to whose mental --

18

whose mental state was relevant.

19

And if we look only to Allen, we -- you

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think, if -- if one were to

20

look only at agency principles, even -- even Wheat would

21

be high enough.

22

more detail to that.

But -- but if I could respond in some

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's exactly right.

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I -- I think that mechanically

5

carrying over here the principles of agency law with

6

regard to punitive damages would not be appropriate for --

7

for two distinct reasons.

8

this Court indicated in Faragher and Ellerth that -- that

9

these kinds of issues had to be determined both by looking

And I note, to begin with, that

10

at agency law and by looking at the purposes and

11

principles underlying Title VII.
There are two reasons that I -- I suggest

12

13

that -- that one couldn't mechanically use agency

14

principles.

15

purposes that prompted Congress to adopt punitive damages

16

was to assure more effective monetary relief to deter and

17

punish discrimination in the cases of sexual harassment.

3

Kennedy's question, I would think that a company who has a

4

policy against this -- this kind of activity, and if one

of its lower employees, even -- even an officer such as

Wheat -- violates that policy, I would think, under normal

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20

punitive damages may be awarded.

QUESTION:

This is a case of

And the statute provides

Well, Mr. -- General Waxman, that's

quite true.

But, obviously, looking at the divided

punitive damages are not favorites of the law?

This Court

2

has held a couple of times that there are constitutional

3

limitations on them.

4

So, when there is reasonable doubt as to whether

5

they're available or not, the -- the Court's answer should

6

be they're not available.

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is

8

entirely appropriate for this Court, and other courts, to

9

proceed on the assumption that punitive damages are

10

generally not favored in the law, and that, as this Court

11

demonstrated in BMW v. Gore, there are constitutional

12

limitations on the amount of punitive damages that are

13

awarded.

14

But in this case, as under the ADEA that this

15

Court considered in TWA and Hazen, Congress has made that

16

determination, and it has explicitly stated what standard

17

the plaintiff must prove before the jury may consider the

18

independent question of whether punitive damages can be

19

considered.

20

Justice -- I think it was you -- to observe that as -- as

21

Judge Randolph did in his concurring decision below, that

23

disregard, is viewed essentially as a lesser included

24

offense of knowledge.

The further question that the jury has to

consider in evaluating whether to exercise its

discretionary moral judgment to consider punitive damages

12

is the defendant's consciousness of wrongdoing.

company itself or, in this case, the Association, or some

GENERAL WAXMAN:

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Because I want to keep that in mind

3

as we decide this case.

4

And what is your position on

GENERAL WAXMAN:

5

Well

I think our position on it,

6

Justice O'Connor -- let me first say that, following this

7

Court's decisions in Faragher and Ellerth last spring,

8

there has already developed a split in the circuits,

9

between the Fifth and the 11th Circuit, in cases, both

10

coincidentally involving Wal-Mart, over whether the

11

paradigm that this Court created in Faragher and Ellerth

12

should be directly applied to punitive damages, or whether

13

you should do what the -- whether you should start from

14

the place this Court began in those cases.

15

say, we know we have to look at traditional agency

16

principles and we have to look at the purposes of Title

17

VII .

18

Which is to

Now, Justice Scalia was quite right that

19

traditional agency principles apply differently in the

20

case of punitive damages than they do in the case of

21

compensatory damages.

22

Court, I would say, expressed considerable doubt over

23

whether somebody who was engaging in -- an employee or a

24

supervisor engaging in sexual harassment that did not rise

25

to the level of a tangible employment action could ever be

1

said to be acting within the scope of employment.
And I think that's correct.

2

But the Court found

3

that a comp -- an employer might, nonetheless, be liable

4

because one could say that, with reference to traditional

5

agency principles, the supervisor was aided in the agency

6

relationship.

7

Now, at common law -- and this is reflected in

8

Restatement -- the Restatement (Second) of Torts, 909, and

9

the Restatement of Agency, 217(c), which are identical:

10

An employer is vicariously liable for punitive damages

11

only if the employee acted in a managerial capacity within

12

the scope of employment.

13

Now, the -- the EEOC, prior to Faragher and

14

Ellerth -- and I don't think this Court's opinion changes

15

it any -- has taken the position that if a supervisor,

16

vested with the company's authority to hire or fire, fires

17

somebody in an act of intentional discrimination, the

company -- the jury may consider whether or not punitive

19

damages may be awarded.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FAY:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The fundamental difference in perspective

between the two sides in this case is that the

Petitioner's focus, exclusive focus, on the term "reckless

14

indifference" ignores the fundamental starting point:

15

that this is a statute about punitive damages.

16

Congress uses the term "punitive damages" or other terms

17

derived from common law in a statute, those terms, absent

18

a contrary indication by Congress, have the same meaning

1

as they do at the common law.

It is.
What it says specifically is the

14

first question in these cases is, was there intentional

15

discrimination, say, on the ground of gender?

pretext, that it wasn't a pretext.

I fired her because

Once the facts are established, and if the

plain -- the plaintiff wins on the facts, that means that

question is yes,

that's the end

there's a third very rare situation, where

says.

assessed pretty regularly with intentional discrimination,

17

it might have meant there'd be far fewer cases at the time

this was enacted, when people didn't know what the law is.

answer -- what's the argument that we should do something

the difference between the two -- and Congress' intending

legal duty, that -- that may very well be malice, and at

MR. FAY:

QUESTION:

Yes.
You -- you've also said that the --

that the indifference standard in the statute is -- is

virtually identical, or tantamount, to that kind of

thought Justice Breyer was posing an example where the

MR. FAY:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHNAPPER:

I'd like to respond to a number

10

of the questions that have been asked by the Court by

11

returning to the distinction I made at the outset between

12

the statutory prerequisites and instructions that might be

13

given to guide the discretion of the jury.

14

Section 1 81a sets forth two and only two

15

prerequisites:

16

reckless indifference or malice.

17

courts are at liberty to add a third prerequisite to that

18

list.

We don't think that the

The statute says that if those requirements are

Now, a number of the concerns the Court raised I

21

think could properly be contained in guidance that would

22

shape the jury's exercise of its discretion, but that's

23

fundamentally different.

But, in all fairness, the words "reckless indifference"

read it.

Punitive damages

That is, damages for egregious conduct.

And the other way to read it is -- is not as a

damages that punish the defendant -- may be awarded

QUESTION:

9

Well, there was one brief, at least,

that said, inherent in the very word "punitive damages" is
