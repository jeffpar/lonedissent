ORAL ARGUMENT OF VAN AARON HUGHES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

11

MR. HUGHES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Because this matter was decided by the lower

12

court on a motion to dismiss, for purposes of today's

13

argument, United cannot dispute the nature of the

14

discrimination that occurred here.

15

to great lengths to make themselves eminently qualified to

16

fill the piloting positions at issue here, but were

17

excluded from those positions by United based not upon

18

their actual abilities, but based only upon its

19

preconceived notion of what a person who shares their

20

impairment can and cannot do.

21

Petitioners have gone

Now, United contends that even if it

22

discriminated in just this manner, it cannot be liable

23

under the Americans with Disabilities Act because, as a

24

matter of law, the ADA can never protect one with severe

25

but correctable myopia.

United's intuition that myopia is somehow

2

distinct from other correctable impairments does not

withstand serious scrutiny.

5

they were regarded as disabled with respect to the ability

to work by United.

QUESTION:

Petitioners here are actually

Is that raised in your petition for

certiorari, whether they were regarded as disabled?
MR. HUGHES:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.
Whereabouts?
The -- I believe it was the third

12

question presented in our petition, read as followed:

Is

13

a commercial pilot regarded as disabled by a major airline

14

that refuses to employ her as a pilot for that airline due

15

to her poor vision?

16

QUESTION:

As far as actual disability is

17

concerned, let me ask the same question that -- that we

18

put to counsel yesterday.

19

which requires nothing more than eyeglasses, is included

20

within the definition of disability, how do you account

21

for the fact that the act itself estimates there are some

22

43 million disabled people in America?

23

MR. HUGHES:

24

QUESTION:

25

If myopia, correctable myopia,

than that if - - if you are counting people who have to

wear eyeglasses.
MR. HUGHES:

2

I agree, Justice Scalia, that there

3

are more than 43 million Americans who wear glasses.

It

4

has never been our position that the mere fact of wearing

5

glasses or, indeed, the mere use of any corrective measure

6

is in itself a disability.

7

intended not to identify bright line categories of what

8

are and are not disabilities, but rather to require courts

9

to evaluate the severity of each person's impairment on a

Our position is that Congress

10

case-by-case basis.

11

QUESTION:

How do you find in the text of the

13

QUESTION:

Where do you get that in the statute?

14

MR. HUGHES:

15

QUESTION:

12

16
17

statute?

have done that.

The statute -It's a nice idea.

Maybe they could

How did they do it here?

MR. HUGHES:

The statute requires that -- that

18

each impairment be substantially limiting with respect to

19

a major life activity, and moreover, the definition

20

requires a substantial limitation of the major life

21

activities of such individual.

22

requiring the court to define each impairment and state

23

each impairment in every case is a disability or is not a

24

disability.

25

could have followed, but Congress didn't follow that --

I read that as not

That's a different approach that Congress

1

that approach.

Congress required each person's impairment

2

to -- to be evaluated.

3

There is no dispute in this case - -

4

QUESTION:

I'm not following you.

You're saying

5

it's not substantially limiting if you use some

6

eyeglasses, but it is -- if it can be corrected with some

7

eyeglasses, but it -- it is substantially limiting if it

8

can be corrected with other eyeglasses?

9
10

MR. HUGHES:

That's correct.

The substantial

limitation -QUESTION:

11

I mean, the only limitation of

12

putting on eyeglasses is putting on the eyeglasses.

13

mean, you know, whatever the -- the corrective

14

prescription is, the only limitation involved is putting

15

on the eyeglasses, whereupon you see as well as anybody

16

else.

17

from others.

18

I

But you're saying some eyeglasses are different

MR. HUGHES:

That's correct.

I don't -- I

19

respectfully disagree that putting on the eyeglasses as

20

the substantial limitation is identical for each person

21

who wears eyeglasses.

22

some persons cannot see without eyeglasses.

23

QUESTION:

The substantial limitation is that

What's -- what's the difference

24

between someone, say, with 20/40 vision who puts on

25

eyeglasses and is corrected to 20/20 and someone who has

20 -- 20/200 vision and puts on eyeglasses and it's

2

corrected to 20/20?

3

they're both the same.

So far as their corrected state,

MR. HUGHES:

4

In the corrected state, that's

5

true.

They're both the same, just as any person who --

6

who swallows a pill once a day and is able to function by

7

taking that medication is in the same boat.

8

make a difference whether you're swallowing the pill to

9

avoid mild headaches in the afternoon as opposed to

But it does

10

swallowing the pill because you might have an epileptic

11

seizure.

12

QUESTION:

Could you address the question of why

13

you should look to the uncorrected state rather than the

14

corrected state in order to determine whether the person

15

is disabled?

16

get to that?

17
18
19

At some point, would you -- are you going to

MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor, and I'll address

that right now.
Our reading of the statute is that the inability

20

to perform a major life activity without the use of

21

corrective measures is itself a substantial limitation.

22

Now, respondent United reads the statute differently and

23

says, if you can perform the major life activity by the

24

use of a corrective measure, then by definition you're not

25

substantially limited.

Now, those are two alternative

readings of the statute.
I believe this Court has already gone a great

2

3

distance toward answering that question in Bragdon v.

4

Abbott when this Court instructed that the act deals not

5

with utter inabilities to perform a major life activity,

6

but substantial limitations on that.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Hughes --

QUESTION:

I --

QUESTION:

-- this seems to be a rather abstract

10

categorization.

that's -- what is it?

20 over 120.

MR. HUGHES:

13
14

We have, as I understand it, a test
That's how the

20 -- 20 over 100, Justice

Ginsburg.

15

QUESTION:

Oh, 100, yes.

16

Would you put all people who, without the

17

correction -- go from 100 to 400 -- all those people would

18

fit within the disabled category?

19

something different between a mere impairment and a

20

substantially limiting one.

21

MR. HUGHES:

Because there's

That's correct.

And some persons

22

who don't have perfect vision, 20/20 vision, may not even

23

be impaired if they're within the norm.

QUESTION:

1

I would -- I'd like you to address

2

what the standard is in this case.

3

Everyone who flunks that test would meet your definition

4

of substantially -MR. HUGHES:

5

It's 20 over 100.

I -- I can't say that as a matter

6

of fact.

It will require a case-by-case determination.

7

know that in this case the allegations are that these

8

particular plaintiffs cannot see without glasses.

9

has conceded - QUESTION:

10

I

United

But what difference does that make in

11

terms of who is being protected?

12

number of people, all of whom are visually impaired, can't

13

make it.

14

Why would Congress want to say for the ones who are, say,

15

200, they are protected by this act, but the ones who are

16

only 100 are not?

17

Here's a standard.

A

Why would -- and they're equally correctable.

MR. HUGHES:

Congress clearly did intend to draw

18

a line where not everyone would be covered, and I believe

19

substantial limitation requires that we analyze the

20

severity of each person's impairment.

21

QUESTION:

I know --

Does substantial limitation take into

22

account the job market, or is it substantial limitation in

23

the abstract because this definition covers all the titles

24

in - - in the ADA?

25

MR. HUGHES:

As far as whether substantial

1

limitation covers the job market -QUESTION:

2

In other words, what I'm getting at

3

is it might make -- I don't -- I'm not -- I don't think

4

we've got this, but it might make sense to say your

5

limitation is substantial if you can't do the job without

6

putting the glasses on even though your eyesight is

7

imperfect.

8

I'm guessing that -- that even on your theory, that is not

9

how we would judge what is substantial because I think

And -- and so, we draw a pragmatic line.

But

10

we're dealing with a general definition here which is not

11

limited simply to the employment category.

12

MR. HUGHES:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Substantial --

So - - so, that leaves us then at sea

14

as to -- as to what the criterion for substantial should

15

be, and I take it you're not saying that substantial is

16

anything which is different from the uncorrected average

17

in the population.

18

cannot be determined in relation to what is necessary to

19

do the job.

20

And substantial, we've just said,

So, what does it mean?

MR. HUGHES:

Where are we?

We're at the point of having to

21

analyze on a case-by-case basis the severity of each

22

person's impairment which certainly doesn't create the --

23
24

a bright line test that -QUESTION:

No, but that -- that doesn't take --

you don't judge severity by ability to do the job.

what do you judge it by?

You judge it by the person's

Then

Here we're --

So - -

I thought you said no.

I thought you

said it's not judged by the ability to perform the job.
MR. HUGHES:

0

It's not judge by the ability to

11

perform a job, unless we're talking about the major life

12

activity of working.

If we're talking about the major

3

life activity of seeing, it's judged by can you see, can

you do the things that a person with normal eyesight can

do.

It's

certainly not a substantial limitation.

QUESTION:

MR. HUGHES:

Well, on a case-by-case -The waiter thinks so.

But why not?

Seriously.

Well, because I believe if you can

6

see for most contexts, if there's one particular, isolated

7

context where you have some difficulty, like reading a

8

menu in dim light, I would anticipate that a court would

9

not find that to be a substantial limitation on your

10

ability to see.
QUESTION:

11

Oh, but -- but being -- not being

12

able to read at all -- I mean, I cannot read without

13

reading glasses, and I would not be able to function in

14

this job or in any job I've ever had.

16

Now, there are a lot of Americans like that whose job

17

requires reading, maybe 100 million.

18

Are they all covered by the Americans with Disabilities

19

Act ?

20

You know, I've been

I've been -- all jobs that required reading.

MR. HUGHES:

100 million anyway.

The inability to read without

21

glasses would be one example of a limitation of your

ability to see.

23

is open to question.

QUESTION:

What's your answer to the question?

2

QUESTION:

-- that's on a -- on a case-by-case

basis, that seems to contradict the finding of and the

4

purpose of Congress which is to say there is a discrete

5

and insular minority here who are subjected to

6

stigmatizing treatment in society.

7

seems to drop out of your reading of -- of the statute.
MR. HUGHES:

8

9

That whole concept

I don't -- I don't believe so, Your

Honor, because I believe that the number of people who

10

honestly can't perform life activities without corrective

11

measures -- I don't assume that that's a staggering

12

number.

13

14

does not violate Congress' intentions with respect to the

15

ADA.

16

We'll never know because most of those people

QUESTION:

And certainly this case

Well, I think one of the things

17

that's bothering the Court is that we assume that a

18

significant number of legislators and Congressmen had

19

severe myopia and we can't imagine that they thought they

20

were disabled when they enacted this law.

21

something that's in the back of -- of our minds as we're

22

asking these -- these questions today and yesterday.

23

MR. HUGHES:

I think that's

I don't agree with that for two

24

reasons.

25

that -- is I think the severity of a person's impairment

One is what I've attempted to articulate, which

is critical under the statute.

2

Secondly,

this is a -- a case where at a minimum

3

petitioners were regarded as being limited in the ability

4

to work, and so it's difficult for me to conceive that

5

this isn't -QUESTION:

6

Well, were they regarded as limited

7

in their ability to do a single job,

8

for United?

9

MR. HUGHES:

to wit, as a pilot

I don't believe so.

I believe they

10

were limited in the ability to perform a class of jobs,

11

all of the jobs requiring the same skills,

ability.

Well, a class of jobs for United?

One of the two is still working for

a regional airline, yes.
QUESTION:

20

QUESTION:

1

Well, I'm looking at EEOC's

2

regulation which attempts to define whether one is

3

substantially limited in the major life activity of

4

working, and it says, the inability to perform a single,

5

particular job does not constitute a substantial

6

limitation in the major life activity of working.

7

what we have here?
MR. HUGHES:

8

9

Is that

Your Honor, with respect to the

actually disabled prong, which is what that -- that

10

language goes to, yes, it is the case that petitioners are

11

not actually disabled with respect to the ability to work

12

because they're able to work in other positions in the

13

same class of jobs.

14

QUESTION:

15

So, that's not your claim and that's

not the -- the complaint.

MR. HUGHES:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
It -- it is instead a substantial

limitation on the ability to see?

it?

Would you explain?
MR. HUGHES:

20

Is that -- or what is

Yes.

We have -- we have two

independent arguments.

One is that we were actually --

that my clients were actually substantially limited in the

perceptions that are at issue.
QUESTION:

2

That's --

Well, but on the regarded as prong,

3

it again is related to a single, particular job, pilot for

4

United.

5

MR. HUGHES:

Your Honor, we're not -- I don't

6

believe we're talking about a single job.

7

said you can't fill this position or these particular

8

positions, but you can fill these other positions, that

would be a different example.

If United had

O'Connor.

11

Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, no appellate court has

12

ever held that any person with fully corrected

13

nearsightedness is disabled or handicapped.

14

appellate courts have reached a contrary conclusion and so

has the EEOC itself in a decision rendered the very same

the passage of the act.

3

Another reason is that this position is taken

4

only in interpretative guidance, not in a regulation,

5

which under this Court's cases is treated quite

6

differently.

7

A third reason is that the particular language

8

on which the EEOC and petitioners rely was added after the

9

comment period.

Now, that doesn't invalidate it under the

10

APA and we've never argued that it's invalid under the

APA, but it does affect the level of deference under the

3

Having been discriminated against or being likely to be

4

discriminated against is not a criterion by which that

number was derived.

6

With respect to the legislative history, the

7

number can be traced back through Representative Coelho's

comment to the report of the National Council on the

Handicapped, On the Threshold of Independence.

And this

10

is a very interesting study that in turn draws on a census

11

study, Disability, Functional Limitation, and Health

12

Insurance Coverage 1984-'85, which asks functional

questions, and the functional question it asks about

We have -- for those who are inclined to

indication that Congress had a view on this subject.

MR. ENGLERT:

I think that's the problem

For just the reason that some of

6

your own earlier questions suggested, Justice O'Connor,

7

which is that eliminating someone from a single job is not

8

regarded as.

9

Everyone agrees on that.

Now, the question is how much do you have to go

beyond a single job to make out a regarded as claim, and

I would respectfully suggest we have to hold that Doug

Now, if these plaintiffs were regarded as
