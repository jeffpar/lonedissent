ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. EVANS:

10

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
After this Court granted certiorari in this

12

case, respondents adopted a surprising strategy.

13

brief on the merits, they refused to address the two

14

issues on which the Court granted review and instead

15

offered up lengthy arguments on issues that the Court had

16

not agreed to review and, in fact, arguments that

17

respondents had not made or mentioned in their brief in

18

opposition.

1

And then in yet another surprise about 2 weeks

20

ago, respondents later withdrew one of those three

21

arguments in their -- in their merits brief.

22

In their

Barring another surprise today, therefore, what

23

we are left with are two arguments, neither of which can

24

succeed unless the Court is prepared to overrule a very

25

large number of its Eleventh Amendment and Commerce Clause

precedents.

2

To bring the case rather briefly back to where

3

it started, the Court granted certiorari to consider two

4

questions:

5

a bar against a constitutional challenge to an Alabama

6

State tax brought by taxpayers who were complete strangers

7

to the prior judgment that was asserted as a bar, and the

8

second involving the lawfulness of Alabama's franchise tax

9

under this Court's Commerce Clause precedents.

one involving Alabama's use of res judicata as

10

Now, although respondents put up a defense on

11

both of these issues in their brief in opposition, they

12

obviously chose not to do so again in their merits brief.

13

And I think I can understand why.

14

issues are controlled by this Court's recent and

15

frequently unanimous precedents.

16

case is a near -- in our -- in our judgment is a near

17

clone of Richards against Jefferson County, which was

18

decided less than 3 years ago by a unanimous Court in

19

another case that came from Alabama.

20

Clause question is controlled by Fulton against Faulkner

21

and in another recent Commerce Clause decisions of this

22

Court that have condemned facially discriminatory taxes

23

and that have narrowed the complementary tax doctrine.

explained in our brief, the Alabama franchise tax is

2

unlawfully discriminatory because it taxes Alabama

3

corporations based on the par value of their capital

4

stock, a figure that they are utterly free to set and

5

adjust as they wish without any effect on their business

6

operations.

7

on the capital actually employed in the State, in other

8

words, based on their business operations in Alabama.

But it taxes out-of-State corporations based

In our view there's no -- no need to look any
10

further because any tax that allows in-State corporations

11

to, in effect, determine their own tax liability and not

12

out-of-State corporations is facially discriminatory.

13

In their merits brief in this Court, respondents

14

obviously have abandoned their defense on both of these

15

issues, and they've raised three new issues, one involving

16

the jurisdiction of the Alabama State courts, one

17

challenging this Court's appellate authority under the

18

Eleventh Amendment, and one attacking the entire body of

1

this Court's negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
The first of these issues need not concern the

20

21

Court any longer because 2 weeks ago Mr. Cooper wrote a

22

letter to the clerk withdrawing his jurisdiction argument

and acknowledging that it was in error.

8

three with another who did not join the opinion but -- but

9

also dissented.
In our view,

10

the Court need not reach any of the

11

other issues that -- either of the other issues that

12

respondents raise here because they've waived those

13

arguments by not presenting them in their brief in

14

opposition.

15

believe the Court should reject both of these arguments.

16

Both ask the Court to overrule rafts of its own precedents

17

without any serious justification in our view.

18

But if the Court does reach the issues, we

2

respondents have provided no good reason to revisit it.
And in their negative Commerce Clause argument,

3

the respondents ask the Court to nullify a principle the

4

Court has embraced for at least a century and a half and

5

that has engendered enormous reliance throughout the

6

Nation's economy.

7

this in the least controversial aspect of the negative

8

Commerce Clause, one that invalidates State laws that --

9

that facially discriminate against interstate commerce.

10

And moreover, they ask the Court to do

As we explain in our reply brief, there is

11

simply no reason to do either of these things.

12

the doctrines that we're talking about were announced and

13

splintered or badly reasoned opinions that reflected

14

departure from established precedent.

15

unworkable.

16

what they view as excesses in the application of the

17

negative Commerce Clause, but even those members have

regularly expressed a willingness to continue to apply the

19

core principle of anti-discrimination.

to do so.

clear that stare decisis has extra force where Congress

can itself make changes in the Court's decisions.

And the Court's precedents have repeatedly made

QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, do you think the -- the

6

Congress could cut off this Court's appellate

7

jurisdiction, say, just in Commerce Clause cases?

8

MR. EVANS:

I -- I don't know the answer to

that, and it's clearly not something we need to worry
10

about at the moment.

11

interesting question, and it may well be able to do that

MR. EVANS:

18

This -- one of the things that I've noticed

That's for sure.

1

recently, in this term even, is that the Court has

20

repeatedly refused to consider arguments raised by

21

respondents as alternative grounds for affirmance that

22

have not been preserved, sometimes invoking rule 15.2,

23

sometimes not.

Earlier this term, there was a case called

So, from the point of view of petitioners, the

4

Court should not address either of these new arguments

5

that have been made by respondents, but should simply

6

decide the questions on which it granted certiorari,

7

reject the arguments that respondents made in their brief

8

in opposition on those grounds, reverse the judgment, and

9

remand it for provision of appropriate relief consistent

10
11

with the Court's precedents.
QUESTION:

In any of those cases, was the new

12

argument that we rejected an argument to the effect that

13

we have no jurisdiction?

14

MR. EVANS:

There are cases, Justice Scalia, in

15

which -- at least two cases in which the Court has

recently said that if a State does not raise an Eleventh

Amendment argument, it need not be considered.

It has -- it

has -- as the Court has put it, it partakes of

the process than at the first instance, but it is not

the argument was raised in a brief in opposition but not

to consider it.

QUESTION:

-- point, not only do we have to

10

entertain it if -- if the respondent raises it here for

11

the first time or the petitioner, indeed we have to

12

entertain it on our own, even if he doesn't raise it here

13

for the first time.

14

MR. EVANS:

15

QUESTION:

I -- I fully agree.
Well, there's some earlier Eleventh

16

Amendment cases, aren't there, Reed Detective and that

17

Indiana case, that say it can be raised here for the first

18

time?

1

MR. EVANS:

It can be raised here for the first

20

time, and I'm not suggesting anything to the contrary, but

21

it needs to be raised properly.

22

these more -- in Patsy where it was not raised properly in

23

the merits brief, even though it had been raised here, the

24

Court felt no obligation to consider it.

2

showed up for the first time in the merits brief.

3

Certainly a respondent could not come here and make an

4

argument for the first time in oral argument.

5

some requirement of propriety about when something must be

6

presented, and this Court has every reason to disregard an

7

argument that shows up for the very first time in the

8

brief on the merits.
QUESTION:

10

There's

Mr. Evans, what are the two cases you

were saying where we had done this before?
MR. EVANS:

11

The case called Knowles, K-n-o-w-1-

12

e-s, which was decided earlier this term, footnote 2,

13

which refused to consider an alternative argument

14

presented for the first time in the merits brief and not

15

in the brief in opposition, and El Al Airlines, which

16

again was not preserved in the -- where the argument was

17

not preserved in the merits brief, and that was in

18

footnote 10 of that decision.

QUESTION:

20

inappropriate to raise this?

21

Commerce Clause is an argument he couldn't really raise

22

before this Court.

23

whether or not the Commerce Clause jurisprudence was

24

properly applied, and -- and now he agrees that Alabama

25

was wrong.

But they do have an

11

obligation to present it in their brief in opposition, in

part, to give notice to petitioners so that we can

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5

7

MR. COOPER:

Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse me --

and may it please the Court:
The argument that has preceded me has

8

crystallized, I think, two issues:

one with respect to

9

our Eleventh Amendment argument, one whether or not it is

10

appropriate for it to be taken up and considered by the

11

Court in light of the fact that it was not mentioned in

12

the opposition to the certiorari; and second, if it is,

13

whether it has merit.

14

This Court's rule 15.2 says that we may waive an

15

objection based upon what occurred in the proceedings

16

below if the objection does not go to jurisdiction.

We submit to the Court that the Eleventh

Just a little over 2 years ago, this Court in

20

Seminole Tribe said that the Eleventh Amendment stands for

21

the constitutional principle that State sovereign immunity

22

limited the Federal courts' jurisdiction under Article II.

The Court has repeatedly stated that the Eleventh

Amendment, for example, in the Ford case which really is

case
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Cooper, may I interrupt you with

3

this point to read from a unanimous opinion

4

with which you are no doubt familiar.

5

Eleventh Amendment does not constrain the appellate

6

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over cases arising from

7

State courts.

It says, the

Period.

Now, that -- you are asking us to overrule a

8

unanimous

-year-old decision.
MR. COOPER:

Is that correct?

That is accurate, Justice Ginsburg.

11

I have many reasons for that request that I -- that I will

12

-- that I will address, but --

13

QUESTION:

May I ask you also as an anterior

14

question, do we take it that you are not pursuing any of

15

the -- the questions that were in -- raised originally?

16

You are -- you are not defending the res judicata point

17

that the Alabama court relied on and you're not defending

18

their analysis of the discriminatory tax.

1

MR. COOPER:

Justice Ginsburg, that is accurate.

20

We are saying that the Commerce Clause merits argument is

21

that we -- we're entitled to prevail on that but not

22

because of the Alabama Supreme Court's correct application

23

of the Commerce Clause precedents, but rather because, as

24

three members of this Court argued not long ago, the

25

dormant Commerce Clause cases are not well considered, and

the Court should carefully reexamine those arguments that

2

were advanced by those --

3

QUESTION:

But so, if we don't -- if we don't

4

accept these new arguments you're presenting today, then

5

you agree that we must reverse the -- the judgment.
MR. COOPER:

6

Unless some member of this Court

7

can think of a different argument, Justice Ginsburg, for

8

upholding the Alabama Supreme Court's decision, that is

9

accurate.
Our premise argument however, Justice Ginsburg,

10
11

is that this Court cannot reach the merits of this issue

12

because of the Eleventh Amendment.

13

And again, Ford Motor Company, which I think the

14

Chief Justice was referring to earlier, the Indiana case,

15

Your Honor, is on, we believe, all fours in terms of the

16

ability of the Court to take the case up.

17

the State of Indiana did not raise the Eleventh Amendment

discretion not to reach the issue.

Mr. Cooper, this is -- this is the

problem, as I see it, with fair notice.

One could hardly

anticipate such a question given that there was a

unanimous decision 9 years ago addressing precisely that

question and rejecting your position.

So, the petitioner

10

could hardly expect that that would be an issue in this

case, and that's why this is so troublesome, that you're

12

bringing up something that one really could not have

anticipated.

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, all I can say is that

the issue, again, goes to jurisdiction.

questions, whether it would have been better practice, and

18

certainly it would have, to have mentioned this in the

The case is squarely within the very letter of

submission to the Court that the McKesson case, for a

number of reasons, was simply wrong.

QUESTION:

In fact --

If -- if it is a jurisdictional

objection based upon sovereign immunity, which is what you

assert, right, the Eleventh Amendment being a reflection

8

of sovereign immunity, sovereign immunity is normally

waivable, isn't it, by the sovereign?

So, I mean, it may

10

be jurisdictional, but -- but maybe it's a peculiar -- it

11

has to be a peculiar kind of jurisdiction.

8

is, a case as in Seminole brought by a citizen of the
State against the State, then the Court's analysis -- or

the dissenting Justices' analysis in Seminole Tribe, it

11

seems to us, is precisely correct.

12

QUESTION:

Well, of course, those -- those who

13

agreed with the majority position did so on the assumption

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. EVANS:

Just three very quick points.

14

Mr. Cooper has referred to Seminole's -- the

15

opinion in Seminole as suggesting that there are other

16

routes to raise Federal issues.

17

is referring to is footnote 14, and the three items that

18

are mentioned are a suit by the United States, an Ex parte

19

Young action, and then I'd like to just quote this

20

language.

The footnote I believe he

21

And this Court is empowered to review a question

22

of Federal law arising from a State court decision where a

23

State has consented to suit.

underscore Justice Kennedy's point that the assumption

25

underlying Seminole may well have included this Court's

That is this case, just to

1

appellate authority over a case like this.

2

Second, Mr. Cooper mentioned the Ford Motor case

3

as an example of one that held that a -- a waiver of State

4

sovereign immunity does not necessarily translate into a

5

waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.

6

with respect to actions in the district court.

7

case, which is typically cited for this proposition, says

8

the following at page 470 at 323 U.S.

True, but only
That very

As we indicated in the Reed case, the

9
10

construction given the Indiana statute leaves open the

11

road to review in this Court on constitutional grounds

12

after the issues have been passed on by State courts.

13

the very decision in which the Court held that a -- a

14

State sovereign immunity waiver does not convert to an

15

Eleventh Amendment waiver also assumes that there's review

16

available in this Court.

17

So,

And finally, a lot of this we believe is

18

entirely hypothetical because the -- for purposes of

19

Alabama law -- this is a case cited at page 6 of our reply

20

brief -- in a case called State against Norman Tobacco,

21

which was basically the reason the jurisdictional argument

22

that Mr. Cooper had made as his first argument did not

23

work.

24

of the sort we have here -- and I'm quoting again -- is

25

not a suit against the State.

The Alabama Supreme Court said that a -- an action

question.
