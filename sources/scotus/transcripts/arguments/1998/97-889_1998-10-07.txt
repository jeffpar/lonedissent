ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAY P. McCLAIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. McCLAIN:

Excuse me.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner Ceasar Wright seeks a hearing on the

12

merits of his claim that the respondents violated his

13

rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act when they

14

refused to accept him for work when he was referred from

15

the union hiring hall.

16

As the district court found when Mr. Wright was

17

refused work, he took the matter to the union.

18

protested on his behalf, but when the employers would not

19

accede to the union's protest, the union decided, as the

20

district court found, that they would not pursue the

21

matter as a formal grievance, and recommended that Mr.

22

Wright should take the matter to private counsel to bring

23

the case under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

24
25

QUESTION:

The union

Do you think that the ADA claim could

have been resolved in a grievance procedure?

MR. McCLAIN:

1

2

This grievance procedure I do not

believe was thought by the union to cover it.
QUESTION:

3

I'm not asking you what the union

4

thought.

7

claim could have been resolved?

I'm asking you whether -- if -- suppose the
Do you think under

Not with finality.

No, not

binding on the petitioner, if it was -- if it had been
addressed, no.
QUESTION:

Why would it not have been binding on

the petitioner?
MR. McCLAIN:

Because the grievance procedure

14

itself did not specifically provide for a statutory claim

15

to be pursued through that manner.

16

QUESTION:

So then you're saying that the

17

collective bargaining agreement, because it didn't specify

18

statutory claims, didn't include this kind of a claim?

19
20

MR. McCLAIN:

That's been the holding of this

Court for years, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

In what cases?

22

MR. McCLAIN:

Livadas v. -- the Livadas case is

23

the most recent one, in which it was indicated that the

24

waiver of an individual's right to proceed under a law

25

that was applicable to all workers would not be inferred.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you said a holding of this

2

case, and now you say -- the case you cite for the

3

holding, you say it was indicated in the case.

4

Livadas a holding on this point?

5

MR. McCLAIN:

I believe it actually was part of

6

the holding of that case, Your Honor.

7

more carefully to be absolutely sure of that.
QUESTION:

8

9

Was

I'd have to read it

If there had been a nondiscrimination

clause in the collective bargaining agreement, would that

10

have changed the situation here?

11

enough?
MR. McCLAIN:

12

Would that have been

No, because as in Alexander the

13

petitioner had both remedies recognized by this Court's

14

decision.

15

QUESTION:

Well, Alexander's been cut back in

16

later cases by our Court.

17

Alexander has certainly been undercut as to arbitration

18

not being a satisfactory way of handling these cases.

19

MR. McCLAIN:

Some of the reasoning of

That's correct, Your Honor, but

20

however, an essential part of the reasoning of Alexander

21

which this Court emphasized in the decision in the Gilmer

22

case is as applicable today as it was when Alexander was

23

decided, and that is that Mr. Wright had no legal

24

authority to compel a hearing on his claim.

QUESTION:

2

Why is that worse for a statutory

claim than it is for - - is that only bad for Federal

statutory claims, or is it State statutory claims as well?

The same rule applies to the State

QUESTION:

MR. McCLAIN:

9

QUESTION:

To State statutory claims.
Which Livadas was an example of.

Why is a State statutory claim

10

against -- well, let's assume - - or a Federal, against

11

discrimination, why is that more important to the worker

12

than his common law right to get the money owed him for

13

work performed under a contract?

14

between one and the other, which one would you rather give

15

up?

16
17
18

MR. McCLAIN:

I mean, you know, as

I don't want to give up either

one, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

Yes, me neither, but if I had to pick

19

I would think my right to agreed-upon contract

20

compensation might be the more important to me, to tell

21

you the truth.

22

MR. McCLAIN:

23

QUESTION:

Well --

What's the reason for this rule?

And

24

what if California codifies its law of contract so that

1

the contract becomes a statutory right?

2

what, nongrievable in the union contracts?

3

MR. McCLAIN:

It then becomes,

Your Honor, basically -- let me

4

back off just a minute and try to start with the questions

5

one at a time.

6

QUESTION:

All right.

7

MR. McCLAIN:

First, Congress has determined

8

that certain minimum standards should apply to all

9

workers, and they have determined that these minimum

10

standards are enforceable in court, and they've determined

11

that they're only -- as this Court held in Alexander, it

12

has been determined that there are only two jurisdictional

13

requirements for going to court.

14

QUESTION:

But congressional law is

15

interstitial.

I mean, Federal law, especially in these

16

areas of contract, is really not the dominant law.

17

States have determined, I can say just as --

The

18

MR. McCLAIN:

Well, I would --

19

QUESTION: -- just as ponderously the States have

20

determined that a man or woman should get a day's pay for

21

a day's work as agreed upon, and has determined that there

22

should be a lawsuit available for that.

23

MR. McCLAIN:

But in the unionized contract --

24

context, it is in fact Federal law that governs because of

25

the statutory relationship between the union as the
7

1

exclusive bargaining agent for the workers in that unit,

2

and so the union has to be the party to enforce the

3

rights, and the rights that it can enforce are those which

4

it has negotiated with the employer.

5

That's the nature of that particular workplace.

6

It has been organized pursuant to Federal statute, as

7

construed and applied for decades by this Court.

8

QUESTION:

I'm not sure what you're saying.

Are

9

you saying that the rule you're arguing for is that only

10

Federal statutes cannot be made -- cannot be disposed of

11

in the collective bargaining arbitration process?

12

MR. McCLAIN:

No, sir.

What I was stating -- I

13

was trying to answer your question about whether this was

14

a matter of State law, the contract right, and the fact is

15

that the contract right under the collective bargaining

16

agreement is totally regulated by Federal law, and the

17

rights, the manner in which those contract rights are

18

created, and the manner in which those contract rights are

19

enforced are thoroughly regulated by - -

MR. McCLAIN:

QUESTION:

25

You're talking about 301.
That's correct.

And Lincoln Mills, and that -Yes, ma'am.

And that under that whole regime you

have a right to go to court but you have to use the

MR. McCLAIN:

First, under 301 --

QUESTION:

4

collective bargaining regime.

So that works for the whole

5

MR. McCLAIN:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And was your distinction of Gilmer

7

primarily that the -- it is not the worker that has a

8

claim in the grievance procedure, it is the union that is

9

in control and that's --

10

MR. McCLAIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. McCLAIN:

That's --

That's how you differ it from Gilmer?
That's absolutely right.

That's

13

why the union is not capable of making the same promise

14

that Mr. Gilmer made, because the union cannot say, under

15

the labor grievance mechanism, that Mr. Wright will have

16

the power to enforce this contract.
QUESTION:

17
18

Well, but that simply states the

conclusion.

19

What if this case had come up under the Federal

20

Arbitration Act, that these people were not longshoreman,

21

but the Federal Arbitration Act would apply to their

22

contracts?

23

arbitrable, don't you think?

24
25

There we would probably hold that this was

MR. McCLAIN:

Well, Your Honor, of course this

Court has not decided the question of whether or not the

Federal Arbitration Act applies to any contract of

2

employment.
QUESTION:

3
4

No, but let's assume we did decide

that point in favor of arbitration.
MR. McCLAIN:

5

And then -- well, no - - the

6

critical distinction between Mr. Gilmer's situation as an

7

individual and Mr. Wright's situation as a member of an

8

organized bargaining unit is absolutely critical.

Mr. Wright has not in fact --

MR. McCLAIN:

Both

Are you answering my question, or -I'm trying to.

Okay.
Sorry.

Keep trying.
The answer is no under the FAA,

16

because the promise -- the union just can't make the same

17

promise.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but the union certainly is

19

capable of enforcing the contract rights, and it may have

20

to give away some of Mr. Wright's claims there, and you're

21

saying that there's some magic difference between

22

statutory rights and contract rights?

23

MR. McCLAIN:

That is the case because the whole

24

labor grievance arbitration process for enforcing the

25

contract rights is an integral part of the bargain.

QUESTION:

Well, if you made the arbitration

conclusion.

That just states the

To say it's an integral part --

MR. McCLAIN:

No, sir, I'm sorry, I didn't make

myself clear.
When I say it's an integral part of the bargain
I mean that the decision -- in other words, the way in

10

which disputes under the contract are to be resolved is in

11

the contract - -

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. McCLAIN:

14
15
16

Well --- and there is -- it doesn't have

any source in external law, in public law.
QUESTION:

Well, but why does that make a

difference?

17

MR. McCLAIN:

18

QUESTION:

As between the FAA and --

Well, either between the FAA and the

19

present situation or between statutory rights.

20

arbitration is favored, I mean, why don't we encourage the

21

inclusion of arbitration clauses in Federal labor

22

contracts, allow for the arbitration and statutory rights?

23
24
25

MR. McCLAIN:

Because that would threaten the

union's role as the exclusive bargaining agent.
QUESTION:

I mean, if

How would it do that?

1

MR. McCLAIN:

Well, the control, as this Court

2

has emphasized in decisions such as Vaca v. Sipes, the

3

control of the grievance process in the hands of the union

4

subject to only an extremely limited review is essential

5

to the union's role as -- in enforcing the contract, in

6

continuing to maintain labor peace by not only making an

7

agreement with the employer in the first place but by then

8

resolving disputes that arise under the agreement with

9

that employer.

10

And if the union does not have the authority to

11

make these decisions with a very limited scope of review,

12

then it will not be able to have the same give-and-take

13

that this Court has approved - -

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it does have authority to

make these decisions with limited scope of review.
MR. McCLAIN:

That's correct, and then that --

17

that deprives the individual of his right under the

18

Federal statute.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but if his right to -- if his

20

right to contract for wages is subject to that, why

21

shouldn't his statutory rights be subject to that?

22

23

MR. McCLAIN:

In part because this Court

concluded in Alexander that - -

1

has been reaffirmed in numerous cases since that time,

2

because of the absence of the ability of the individual to

3

control the prosecution of his claim, and Congress has

4

approved that arrangement, and --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. McCLAIN:

How did Congress approve it?
In the same way that Congress

7

approved this Court's decision in the Meritor case, as was

8

discussed in the Faragher and Ellers decisions at the end

9

of last term, that the -- in the 1991 Civil Rights Act

10

Congress specifically addressed and modified some eight

11

decisions of this Court.

12

13
14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

It did not address Meritor.

So by not addressing a case Congress

confirms it?
MR. McCLAIN:

Well, in -- that's -- I'm simply

citing the decisions of this Court.
QUESTION:

You must not be familiar with the

legislative process.
QUESTION:

Mr. McClain, I thought your argument

19

at least in part is somewhat different from what you have

20

been saying to the Chief Justice, and let me just put

21

forward what I thought was at least one strand of your

22

argument, and you tell me whether it is or it isn't.

23

I thought at least one strand of your argument

24

was that the line represented in Alexander, for example,

25

or drawn in Alexander still applied here, was that it was

1

2

the only way to respect what Congress has in fact done.
And Congress has in fact given a crucial

3

bargaining role to unions in contract formation, and

4

therefore there's nothing really inconsistent with that

5

with saying, okay, we're also going to give the union an

6

equally significant role in determining how we negotiate

7

enforcement of this contract, if you will.

8

9

But Congress has not given the union any role in
the formation of the right under title -- rights under

10

title VII or the ADA, and that's why we are simply

11

respecting the will of Congress in saying, you can't let

12

the union bargain away what the union has had no role in

13

giving, whereas when you have given the union a role in

14

contract formation it is consistent with congressional

15

intent to let the union have a role in enforcing it.

16

thought that was the guts of your argument.

17

MR. McCLAIN:

I

I think -- I certainly agree with

18

your -- the case as stated, or the propositions as stated,

I don't disagree with that at all.

QUESTION:

I was

May I ask if the end result, then, is

23

what you're saying is, in any employment covered by a

employer cannot contract with the employee, but only with

2

the union?

3

MR. McCLAIN:

Well,

that is the case unless the

4

union authorizes the employer to make a separate agreement

5

with the individuals.

6
7

QUESTION:

10

I didn't know

that.

8
9

Can the union do that?

MR. McCLAIN:

If the union and the individual

agree to do so we believe that they can.

They cannot do

it directly.

11

QUESTION:

Do you know of any instances where

12

they -- you see, one of the things that affects me about

13

this case is,

severe -- and with the multiplication of Federal laws

affecting the employment relationship,

with the union, and if the union doesn't -- certainly if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. UNDERWOOD:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A worker's right to a judicial hearing on a

7
8

claim of employment discrimination is an individual right

9

that can't be waived by a collective bargaining agreement

10

between the union and an employer.

This Court said so in

11

Alexander in 1974 and has reaffirmed that principle many

12

times since then.
It's a matter of statutory interpretation, as

13
14

Justice Souter said earlier, and the Court said so

15

recognizing a fundamental tension between individual

16

statutory rights conferred by Congress and collective

17

representation.

18

The Court said that unions are properly

19

concerned with the collective interests of their members,

20

and that it would be inconsistent with the individual

21

focus of at least the antidiscrimination laws to let a

22

union decide whether and how to enforce claims under those

23

laws.

12

by Congress to negotiate.

13

This, as I said,

is a question of interpreting

14

statutory regimes, and this Court concluded correctly that

15

there were two regimes here, one in which Congress

16

conferred the power to invoke and waive both rights and

17

procedures ancillary to those rights on individuals, and

18

the other on unions, and there's an additional reason for

That's true.

The question is,

3

who did Congress intend to confer the power of enforcing

4

those rights upon in a unionized workplace?

5

QUESTION:

But wait, Alexander, I take it a

6

different case.

In Alexander there was a question of a

7

contractual claim, and the Court said that delegating to

8

the union the power to settle the contractual claim did

9

not delegate to the union the power to settle a statutory

10

claim, which was a different claim, and so what you seem

11

to be arguing is a different thing, which I would like to

12

know the answer to.

13

If I say to you, I like you, you're my friend, I

14

would like you to settle my lawsuit against somebody else,

15

I can do that, no matter whether it comes under a statute

16

or not, so why couldn't I say, the union is my friend. I

17

delegate to the union the power to settle my statutory

18

claim against the employer in this area?

19

Now, I think there's a question of whether this

20

has done that, but suppose it were absolutely clear.

22

to meet with my employer and settle my statutory

these antidiscrimination claims as well.
The point is that you can't -- that Congress

7

didn't intend that the union, who will frequently be, or

8

sometimes be allied with the discriminator, couldn't --

9

could make the agreement on your behalf, that the union

congressional purpose to disallow it?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

3

Well, I think the statutes, the

5

to the individual the right to assert or waive both the

6

statutory right itself and the judicial forum for it, but

7

it would - QUESTION:

8

9

Well, why should that be, because

there is such a danger that the union is going to be a

coparticipant in the kind of discrimination?

15
16

Is that why

Well, I think that's one of the

reasons.
I think it's not just, however, being a

17

coparticipant in the discrimination.

It is the nature of

18

the union's obligation that it has a broad discretion,

19

consistent with the duty of fair representation, to decide

20

which claims to enforce, how vigorously to enforce them,

21

that it may make a judgment, for example, that it would be

more productive in the area of sexual harassment to

QUESTION:

Do I understand --

2

QUESTION:

Am I missing - - am I missing the boat

3

here, or is it really not Justice Breyer's question that

4

we have before us here?

5

As I understood his question, it was the

6

individual employee who would agree to waive it, and

7

that's not the situation here.

8

control over, right?

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It was a collective

This individual employee -- this

11

compuls -- this arbitration clause was a) agreed to by the

12

union and not by the employee and 2) constructed an

13

arbitration process that was controlled by the union and

14

not by the individual.

15

So yes, it does not present the question, could

16

such a contract exist, although I think that there's a

17

serious question about whether it could.

18

I do want to address a question that was raised

19

earlier about whether the union workplace would

20

necessarily be a Gilmer-free world, that is to say,

21

whether it would be possible to negotiate such contracts

22

in the union workplace.

workplaces be unlikely that it would do so.
In workplaces where individuals have a great

2

3

deal of power themselves, union contracts often do reserve

the possibility of individual contracts about all manner

of things, to baseball players and people in the

longshoremen.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

Fickle workers, eh?

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

11

But to return to Justice Souter's question, it

would be possible -- I believe the statutes prohibit the

employee from delegating to the union the power to make

14

these agreements, but another --

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because the risk is just too great,

right?

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

be to indulge -- to establish a strong presumption against

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. EDWARDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

We believe it's clearly a question presented to

6

the Court to hear as to whether there should be two rules

7

of law, one applicable to nonunion employees, and I mean

8

that in the broader sense -- that is, employees not

9

covered by a collective bargaining agreement, rather than

10

just simply union members, and one for those who actually

11

are bargaining unit members.

12

QUESTION:

The --

Either way we're going to have that,

13

is that not true, unless we overrule Alexander, because

14

Alexander says it comes in after the grievance and

15

arbitration procedure has been used, and then the Court

16

says, but title VII is something different, so there's

17

already a separate regime.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the Gilmer

19

decision this Court brought up three issues which were not

20

before the Court in Gilmer, and said that those three

21

issues represented grounds upon which Alexander had

22

continuing vitality.

23

Two of those grounds, I would respectfully

24

submit, are distinctions without a difference, one being

25

the presumption in favor of arbitration under the Federal

1

Arbitration Act, which in my careful reading of this

2

Court's decisions seems to be totally the same as the

3

presumption in favor of labor arbitration.
The second was the question of, in Alexander and

4
5

in Barrentine and in McDonald, the three cases that were

6

characterized by this Court as Alexander and its progeny,

7

the question was, what is the binding effect in terms of

8

res judicata, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, fact

9

preclusion, whatever you want to call them, of an already

10

completed arbitration award, or arbitration decision which

11

you cannot tell from the record of the case considered the

12

discrimination question whatsoever, and so it is certainly

13

possible to continue to distinguish Alexander on those two

14

bases or on the basis -- on the second ground, and never

15

get to a need to overrule.

16

though - -

17

QUESTION:

The question, however,

I don't understand, because it seems

18

to me that if -- unless there's going to be very limited

19

review of the arbitration, then all this is is a

20

protraction thing.

1

by saying there can be no estoppel effect whatsoever, so

2

there is nothing to review, but the question of the scope

3

of review of an arbitration award involving statutory

4

claims is, of course, not properly presented in this case.

5

It is -- that's one which has been litigated in

6

great detail in other cases which I certainly presume are

7

going to find their way in this direction sooner or later,

8

and I think that one of the most instructive decisions in

9

that regard is Judge Edwards' decision in the Cole case in

10

the D.C. Circuit, in which he advocates a heightened

11

scrutiny standard.

12

Because after all, rather than deferring to the

13

arbitrator's contract interpretation in a statutory claim

14

arbitration the arbitrator is, at least in some sense,

15

resolving either questions of law or mixed questions of

16

law and fact which go beyond the terms of the contract per

17

se and, therefore, a court would be empowered to determine

18

whether, in fact, the procedures employed in the

19

arbitration, the remedies available to the grievant in the

20

arbitration comported with title VII, the ADEA, and the

21

Americans with Disabilities Act.

QUESTION:

Well, instead of talking about Judge

In

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

because the same statute that afforded the title VII

plaintiff a right to a jury trial, the Civil Rights Act of

only because -- I'm not making a position here that under

arbitrated.

5

discrimination per se in the agreement.

There is no discri -- no clause prohibiting

QUESTION:

But nothing that specifically

includes statutory claims.
MR. EDWARDS:

Nothing that specifically includes

statutory claims except that section 17 of the collective

10

bargaining agreement requires that the agreement not be

11

construed so as to violate any State or Federal laws,

12

which would mean that, in Ceasar Wright's case, in order

13

for an arbitrator to determine whether he was "qualified"

14

to return to work from his medical leave of absence he

15

would have -- the arbitrator would have had to determine

16

whether the plaintiff was "otherwise qualified" under the

17

terms of the ADA.

18

And therefore this is one of those instances in

19

which the issue to be arbitrated is specific to a

20

statutory claim, unlike the generalized kinds of

21

discrimination claims that are more fairly presented in

22

cases such as Austin, Pryner, Brisentine, and various

23

other cases.

QUESTION:

Why are they less specific?

I mean,

1

MR. EDWARDS:

Well, the agreements in many of

2

those cases, not in Brisentine but in Austin and Pryner,

3

specifically refer to statutory claims, say that statutory

4

claims are dealt with by this agreement, that the

5

affirmative obligations of Federal law with respect to

6

discrimination specifically apply.

7

If Mr. Wright's claim had involved something

8

less integral to contract language than the question of

9

qualifications, then it is quite conceivable that this

10

issue would not have been argued by us to be one committed

11

to the grievance and arbitration process.

Mr. Edwards, may I ask you a question

about the Civil Rights Act in 1991 to which you

QUESTION:

17

Would you assume for a moment that legislative

Certainly, Your Honor.

-- and which you quote on your brief?

history is relevant, and just take that premise.
Are you familiar with the passage in the House

20

report that states that this provision was intended to

21

supplement rather than to supplant the rights and remedies

22

provided by statute, and that the minority had proposed a

23

bill that would have made it clear that one was a

24

substitute for the other, and they rejected that proposal?

25

MR. EDWARDS:

I'm quite familiar with that.

The

1

same language appears in the conference report of the 1990

2

Civil Rights Act, and I believe also in the conference

3

report with respect to the Americans With Disabilities

4

Act.

5

That conference report goes on at one point to

6

say that Alexander is the way the law ought to be applied.

7

However, by the time the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was

8

enacted, Gilmer was the law of the land with respect to

9

arbitration and much of that language in the legislative

10

history becomes rather meaningless, and -QUESTION:

11

Why is it meaningless if it expresses

12

an intent to adopt the earlier view?

13

the report suggests they favor the Gilmer view.

14
15

MR. EDWARDS:

There's nothing in

There's no floor debate on any of

this.

QUESTION:

is it not, that

clearly adopted your view?

19

MR. EDWARDS:

And it's also true, Your Honor,

20

that there have been bills proposed since Gilmer was

21

decided to overrule Gilmer, and those haven't been

enacted.

the statute on which you rely, the 1991 act.
MR. EDWARDS:

2

That's correct, and in the -- a

3

statement by Senator Dole immediately prior to passage in

4

the Senate, Senator Dole said that this provision on

5

encouraging ADR is designed to further the goals expressed

6

in Gilmer, so apparently there are legislators of

7

different views which -MR. EDWARDS:

10

Of course, Senator Dole was

speaking for the minority, and he had supported the bill
that was rejected.
MR. EDWARDS:

question I asked Ms. Underwood.

2

I don't know if you remember it.

You heard her response.

3

But I was thinking of the individual employee,

4

and he simply delegates expressly to the union the power

5

to settle a discrimination claim under a statute, and she

6

was taken a little aback, and she mentioned the history,

7

and I take it the history shows that unions, too, are very

8

much involved in discrimination, and that was one of the

9

reasons why these acts were passed.

10

All right.

My question is, given that history,

11

and given what Justice Scalia said, that we're not dealing

12

with an individual here, we're dealing with a group of

13

people who may or may not be focusing on what's in this

14

particular collective bargaining agreement, and given

15

ambiguous language in that agreement, why should there not

16

be a presumption that there is no delegation of authority

17

in the union to settle such claims, which are not like

18

typical CBA claims.

19

The typical collective bargaining agreement,

20

after all, sends to arbitration disputes arising under the

21

agreement, not normally statutes, unless they're directly

22

related to certain labor areas.

23

So given all that, why wouldn't we say under 301

24

in the discrimination area there is a presumption that the

25

claim is not delegated to the union to settle unless it

to doing that?

MR. EDWARDS:

The critical problem there it

7

seems to me is that then what would really be being said

8

is that except under the most exceptional circumstances an

9

employer which has a collective bargaining relationship

10

with a union cannot have statutory discrimination claims

11

for employees covered by that relationship --

It does not say that.

MR. EDWARDS:

it would have to be stated pretty explicitly, and now,

there is such a situation,

goes to the employees and says, do you want us to settle

I think the hypothetical assumes

certain facts which are highly unlikely to occur in

Now, we know that there are people covered by

MR. EDWARDS:

3

(Laughter.)

MR. EDWARDS:

No - -

No, I would not, because this

5

local union has been enjoined under Boys Markets four or

6

five times because they don't take anything to

7

arbitration.

8

they have to be required by the court to take them to

9

arbitration, so this is a matter of conserving resources

Most of these are individual claims, and

10

on their part, I would suppose.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. EDWARDS:

But in point of fact it winds up

13

being more expensive than less, and that's the whole point

14

of the arbitration choice.

16

QUESTION:

And if you win with that history

we'll surely cut down the volume of litigation, I guess.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. EDWARDS:

I doubt that very seriously,

19

because since the third Boys Markets injunction we

20

obtained there have been no further wildcat strikes, so I

21

think that the message has gotten across, and therefore I

22

believe -- and we've had numerous arbitrations since then

23

that were not required by - - or several arbitrations that

24

were not required by court order.

25

With that in mind, I think that the appropriate

focus really is, should it make any difference that Ceasar

2

Wright was a longshoreman covered by a collective

3

bargaining agreement rather than a foreman working for the

4

same stevedoring contractor in the port of Charleston.

5

If one had an arbitration clause that was

6

incorporated in an application for employment, or an

7

employee handbook, or a policy and procedure manual, while

8

this Court certainly hasn't squarely addressed any of

9

those issues, it would seem to me that the clear weight of

10

Gilmer would be that this agreement, quote unquote,

11

reached without bargaining by the individual would be

12

binding upon him or her as a forum choice.

13

Why should not an agreement reached between an

14

employer and a collective bargaining representative who is

15

obligated under statute and under Federal common law to

16

provide a duty of fair representation to the employee

17

receive a similar degree of deference?

18

We think that the result is quite clear, and

19

that whatever continuing vitality there might be to

20

Alexander has been so severely undermined both by the

21

course of this Court's decisions and by changes in the

22

historic framework, if you will.

23

In 1974, this Court was concerned with massive,

24

systemic discrimination by employers and labor

25

organizations.

We have come a long way since that time,

and during that period of time it's instructive in my view

2

to note that labor organizations have been accorded

3

standing to represent the rights of members of collective

4

bargaining units in asserting claims under title VII and

5

other antidiscrimination statutes.

So if they can do that in court, why can't they
do it in arbitration?

I see no basis for a distinction.

Thank you.
