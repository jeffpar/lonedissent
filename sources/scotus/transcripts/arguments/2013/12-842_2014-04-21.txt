ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLACKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The sweeping worldwide forensic examination

12

of foreign state property that the court of appeals

13

approved targets sovereign property that the FSIA makes

14

categorically immune from process of U.S. courts,

15

including diplomatic, military property, national

16

security assets, property of the States, current and

17

former presidents, and other property outside the United

18

States.

19

courts under the FSIA.

20

This far exceeds the enforcement powers of U.S.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Aren't those issues of

21

privilege?

provision except for 1605(g), which specifically talks

16

the universe of executable property.

13

correct, Justice Ginsburg.

veterans benefits and other categories of assets.

Well, what's the reason ­­

20

in aid of the judgment or execution as provided in the

21

these rules.

22

It's certainly broad enough to encompass this.

23

thought, of course, you can get discovery, in an

24

appropriate case, to find out if the judgment creditor

25

or debtor has property in Florida.

MR. BLACKMAN:

5

issue, at least as I saw it.

there are two ­­ three ways of doing it.

11

I mean, those are three possibilities, or you could say

let's mix them all up.

13

In other words, the Court can just do it on its own.

14

So ­­ so I see four possibilities.

Of course.
A U.S. court could not levy

your only complaint is you shouldn't be able to find out

what ­­ what non ­­ what ­­ what property that is not

8

subject to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is in

Well, property that's subject

respect, the French law and what the French court would

doesn't mean you can't find out and go to France and

roll the dice in France, right?

2

MR. BLACKMAN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

can't even play the game.

5

MR. BLACKMAN:

Well, we would suggest ­­
You're ­­ you're saying you

No.

We're saying that the

6

way you play the game is to do what the Respondent here

7

has done for many years, which is to pursue discovery of

8

property in the United States that's executable by the

9

process of a U.S. court.

10
11

But if it wants to go

abroad ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can't understand this.

12

You acknowledge that you can go after property in

13

France, but you assert you are not entitled to find out

14

what property Argentina has in France.

15

MR. BLACKMAN:

That's a function of a

16

statute which deliberately circumscribes the normal

17

powers of a court.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Suppose I

19

don't ­­ I have exactly the same question.

20

reason that you cannot ask a New York court for

21

discovery to tell us where in the world there is

22

property upon which we can levy ­­ they don't want to

23

know about property where they can't levy.

24

don't want to know about property they can't execute, so

25

they're happy to write into that, even if it isn't

They

Now, why not?

MR. BLACKMAN:

The reason, besides the

language of the statute, is comity.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I didn't find

14

language in the statute that forbids it, but I'll look

15

that up again.

16

barrier, why not?

17

If the language is not an absolute

MR. BLACKMAN:

Well, first of all, the order

18

here, Your Honor, isn't limited to property that's

19

executable.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Let's assume we

21

go back and we say it has to be limited to property that

22

they have a right to obtain to under execution.

23

we're all agreed between the two of us we're going to do

MR. BLACKMAN:

The "why not" is because

5

logically, if you're thinking in terms of ­­ of the

6

statute, the statute doesn't distinguish between the

7

categories that I hope I heard the Court say you would

8

exclude, which the lower court here did not exclude and

9

which the plaintiff in fact was eagerly pursuing ­­

10

diplomatic, military, national security, et cetera.

11

statute doesn't distinguish between those categories of

12

nonexecutable property and property outside the United

13

States, which under the terms of the statute, 1609 and

14

1610, is equally nonexecutable.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

Well, if there were a

limitation ­­ if there were a limitation of that sort,

how would the district court possibly decide what could

fallback position was at least it should be limited to

2

property that could be ­­ on which there could be

3

execution in the country where the property is located.

4

How would the Court go about doing that?

5

MR. BLACKMAN:

I would impose, Justice

6

Alito, a bar that is consistent with international law

7

and practice, that discovery cannot extend under any

8

circumstances to diplomatic property, to military

9

property, to national security assets, to property of a

10

sitting or former head of state of a country, to state

11

officials, to entities other than ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're waiting.

13

property in another country?

We're waiting.

14

MR. BLACKMAN:

Okay.

What about

After you've drawn

15

that line, I would submit that the bright line should

16

simply be if it's property that a U.S. court could

17

execute on that's fair game for tailored discovery.

18

we, I think, all agree that the U.S. court can't execute

19

on foreign property.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

In saying that, are you

21

giving up the argument you started to make before

22

Justice Breyer gave you four ways?

23

Rule 69, the discovery rule, says that ­­ that these

24

rules are subject ­­ "Statutes of the United States" ­­

25

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is one ­­ "Statutes

13
Alderson Reporting Company

You pointed out that

1

of the United States, when applicable ­­ applicable,

2

3

examples of statutes that limit what you can attach,

4

what you can execute on.

5

that ­­ if that's right, then your answer now, well, as

6

long it's the same kind of property in France, the

7

answer would be the only thing you can discover relates

8

to property in the United States.

9

MR. BLACKMAN:

I thought that that's ­­

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

10

I was giving a potential fallback in the event that

11

the Court doesn't agree with that.

12

Argentina's position.

13

That is absolutely

What if Argentina ­­ what if

14

Argentina were a private, a foreign company?

15

16

countries under Rule 69.

17

MR. BLACKMAN:

Could you

That's a question this Court

18

has never actually addressed.

19

think you need to address it here because you have a

20

governing statute, as Justice Ginsburg said, which is

21

deliberately designed to restrict the scope vastly.

to try to figure out all the laws of France and Turkey

17

in relation to execution.

Why not allow it with all these

I want to add that, just as

20

the other slew of examples that I and Justice Ginsburg

for that ­­ why would Congress pass a law limiting

Does the waiver in the bonds not affect this case

MR. KNEEDLER:

It does not because

17

Section 1610 requires that the only property subject to

execution is property within the United States used for

19

commercial purposes, and that's true even when there is

4

fact that this ­­ the context of this case is that

5

Argentina was able to sell bonds and to raise money in

6

the United States, on the capital markets of the United

7

States, only by agreeing to be bound by U.S. law, to be

8

sued in and subject to the judgments of U.S. courts, and

9

by waiving sovereign immunity and consenting to

10
11

attachment in aid of execution.
And there's even a reference in that waiver,

12

which was drafted for Argentina by sophisticated New

13

York counsel, in order to obtain money in the United

States had ­­ had Argentina said, and we won't pay the

judgments, we won't obey the orders of the United States

it's a question of general application, every creditor,

judgment debtor and many judgment debtors move those

17

assets around in order to avoid having to pay the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's why

Mr. Olson, but this is a

sovereign, and as I understand the Foreign Sovereign

21

Immunities Act, it says “execution, the foreign sovereign

22

has immunity, has immunity except ­­ except when we're

23

dealing with commercial property in the United States.”

24

So the statute starts with a blanket immunity against

25

execution for the foreign sovereign and then says, but

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is an exception for property ­­ commercial

2

property in the United States.

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, there's several answers to

4

that.

5

Sovereign Immunities Act, which is not mentioned in the

6

government's brief at all and the government

7

specifically takes the district judge to task for

8

treating Argentina like a private litigant, Section 1606

9

says if jurisdiction is established, the foreign state

First of all, Section 1606 of the Foreign

10

shall be liable in the same manner and to the same

11

extent as a private individual under like circumstances.

12

So the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act specifically

13

said that once jurisdiction is established, and was not

14

unquestionably established here, Argentina is to be

15

treated to the same manner and to the same extent as a

16

private litigant.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

to jurisdiction and liability, the judgment of

liability.

This

Secondly, just to go to Mr. Olson's point,

6

these subpoenas, and I'm reading from JA­56, has as its

7

catch­all, paragraph 12, "each asset or property of any

kind whatsoever which Argentina owns."

10

the definition of "Argentina," including the ministry of

everything and the Second Circuit said that everything

is fair game.

power over foreign states.

22

pointed out, that power is very sharply broken down

23

between the broader power of jurisdiction to adjudicate,

24

which is what 1606 says ­­ once there is jurisdiction to

25

adjudicate, you are treated for purposes of that

And as Justice Ginsburg

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adjudication like anyone else, and the much more limited

2

power to execute.

3

specifically says that the phrase in the statute in

4

1610(a) of "attachment in aid of execution" as opposed

5

to "execution," which is a separate word there, and

6

"attachment" is a separate word there.

7

aid of execution" means the whole panoply of

8

supplemental procedures that a court can use to assist

9

in execution.

10

And the legislative history

"Attachment in

Discovery in aid of execution, as the

11

language indicates in Rule 69, is one of those

12

procedures.

13

that means goes way beyond the allowable end.

14

you not only have the tail of discovery kind of wagging

15

the substantive dog; you have a tail that's cut off from

16

the dog.

17

take discovery of anything no matter if it's conceivably

18

within the reasonable scope of execution and the power

19

that the Federal court has or not.

20

wrong and we ask the Court to reverse it.

21
22
23
24

There's no justification for saying that

It's floating around in the ether.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Otherwise

We can

We think that's

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
above­entitled matter was submitted.)
