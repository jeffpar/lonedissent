ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

9

it please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Section 1514A is written in the classic

11

language which Congress utilizes to regulate

12

relationships between employees and their employers.

13

Legislation regarding how an entity is to treat an

14

employee is understood to refer to the entity's own

15

employees.

16

phrase "terms and conditions" of employment is used in

17

the statute.

18

And that is particularly true here where the

If Section 1514A forbade only contractors to

19

retaliate against employees under the terms and

20

conditions of their employment, I don't think there'd be

21

any question that the courts would understand it was

22

referring to the contractor's own employees.

23

statute has the same ­­ that language has the same

24

meaning, even though it's combined in this instance with

25

prohibitions against retaliation by other types of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

actors.

2

The First Circuit's decision interpreting

3

1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its

4

own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and

5

it leads to four implausible consequences.

6

renders the statutory language regarding contractors

7

virtually meaningless.

8

language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund

9

industry literally meaningless.

First, it

Secondly, it renders that

14

renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the

related remedial provision regarding scienter,uh the

16

burden of proof and an affirmative defense.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

14

the text?

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, our view of this

16

is that the ­­ the meaning of the term "employee"

17

depends on the context in which it's used and it ought

18

to be assessed separately for each of the actors.

when it says no publicly­traded company may retaliate

20

against an employee, it means an employee of the

21

publicly­traded company.

And we have statutes that impose personal

So I ­­

peculiar.

8

contractors, subcontractors, but not ­­ not of any

9

I mean, really, I don't see how you can piece

If it does include

11

employees of ­­ of an officer, is it ­­ is it as much of

12

a disaster as ­­ as your opponent suggests?

14

nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in?

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That is to

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think there are two

relevant limitations here, one of them statutory and one

of them practical.

18

it wouldn't deal with, I think, the situation you

19

hypothesized, that the counterparty, so to speak, of the

20

public company is described as a contractor.

21

think that is not anyone who has ever had a contract

22

with a public company.

23

The statutory one is that, although

And we

"Contractor" in the ordinary parlance refers

24

to an ongoing relationship.

25

The paradigm is someone

8
Alderson Reporting Company

fits lawyers and accountants perfectly.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.
And so if someone from a

4

private firm goes down to Walmart, buys a box of rubber

5

bands, that in ordinary parlance wouldn't be referred to

6

as a contractor.

7

that rules out most mom and pop stores.

8

that kind of relationship with people .

9

11

So we think that as a practical matter

JUSTICE SCALIA:

out the accounting firm that is only used once, right?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you limit it as also

nothing to do with the contract?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

reasons.

Mr. Schnapper, that's the

position that the SEC took in its amicus brief to the

First Circuit.

3

employees of the contractor are reporting possible

4

violations of law by the public company for which the

5

contractor is performing work.

6

It said Section 806 applies where

Justice Breyer has suggested.

8

employees of the contractor, but only when the employees

9

are engaged, you know, only when the violations of law

In other words, yes,

10

that the employee is reporting relates to the work that

11

the contractor is doing for the publicly held company.

12

Do you think that that's a possible reading of the

statute or not?

14

MR. SCHNAPPER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Justice Breyer.
The road is when you see a

7

statute that says "any policeman," they don't mean a

8

policeman on Mars, nor are they likely to mean a

9

policeman in Europe.

The "any policeman" is likely,

10

although it says "any policeman," to mean a policeman in

11

the United States.

12

And similarly where they talk about this,

13

the contractors, they don't mean frauds related to ­­

14

you have to use some kind of scope for the word ­­ for

15

the kinds of frauds that are included in the statute,

16

and you have to read that into language that says

17

nothing about it.

18

And that's ­­ I don't say that that is

19

necessarily easy to do and that's why I started with my

20

first question.

21

MR. SCHNAPPER:

As I said, we think

22

that's ­­ we think that's not the correct reading of the

23

statute, for a couple of reasons.

24

think it unlikely, over and above the fact that Congress

25

was concerned with fraud generally, was that I think

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Another one

is that we

Official

1

Congress would have been reluctant to try to define what

2

was sufficiently related to the corporation.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, to go back to

4

Justice Breyer's hypothetical which gets at this point

5

where you have the gardening ­­ the gardening company,

6

privately held, that's working for a public company, and

7

there's some kind of employee of the contractor is fired

8

and claims that the company is engaging in some kind of

9

fraud that has nothing to do with the public company.

10

So you have that situation.

11

Now you have the identical, another

12

privately held gardening company, exactly the same thing

13

is going on, except they don't have a contract with a

14

public company.

15

the former and not the latter?

16

Why would Congress have wanted to cover

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Justice Alito, I think

17

that's just the way they wrote the statute.

18

concerned with all fraud, but they didn't extend the

19

whistleblowers to all fraud.

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why?

They were

If they are

concerned with all fraud, why not cover them both?

22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, this is sort of a

23

hybrid piece of legislation dealing with corporate

24

problems and fraud, and they kind of melded the two

25

here.

1

But I think there are ­­ it's also important

2

in this situation to­ to

3

think Congress would have ­­ was reluctant ­­ it didn't

4

itself draw a line because the experience of the Enron

5

scandal was that all sorts of terribly complicated

6

arrangements had been drawn up between Enron and these

7

hundreds of off­the­books entities, Jedi, Raptors, LJM,

8

and the like.

bear in mind the following:

I

9

I think Congress correctly concluded that if

10

it tried to write out a description of what else it was

11

covering, someone would think of a way to get around it.

12

And I think it certainly wouldn't have contemplated that

13

Federal courts were to try to untangle these

14

relationships to the point where they could figure out

15

whether, for example, if Andrew Fastow was skimming off

16

money from Chewco, whether that would be sufficiently

17

related to Enron.

18

complicated and I think Congress didn't mean to open the

19

door to that.

20

It's just, it's enormously

And that's brought home by the fact that the

21

statute is written more broadly than AIR­21.

22

essentially modeled on AIR­21, which is a statute

23

adopted a couple years earlier about whistleblowing in

24

the airline industry, particularly with regard to safety

25

work.

It's

In that statute, "contractor" is specifically

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defined to mean an airline contractor dealing with

2

safety.

3

and I think it, in part, because it simply would have

4

been very difficult to do.

5

to give the courts a commission to try to sort that sort

6

of thing out.

7

They did not put that kind of limitation here,

And I don't think they meant

The core problem with the interpretation of

8

the court of appeals is that it really renders almost

9

meaningless the decision of Congress to prohibit

10

retaliation by contractors and subcontractors.

11

Contractors and subcontractors would rarely be in a

12

position to engage in retaliation, but particularly to

13

engage in the very specific kind of retaliation

14

specified in the statute, retaliation in the terms and

15

conditions of employment.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is one of the limitations

17

in the statute where it says, in sub (1), "to provide

18

information relating to fraud against shareholders"?

19

you think "shareholders" means just the shareholders of

20

the public company or does it mean shareholders of the

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The statute protects an employee of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contractor from retaliation.

2

That's what Congress intended to cover, these

3

accountants, lawyers, and outside auditors who were so

4

central to the fall of Enron.

5

some of the questions that the Court had about the

6

limits of the statute and how it would be applied.

That's what the text says.

I'd like to go right to

7

Now, of course, what we're talking about

8

here is really the core of the statute, a contractor

9

retaliating against its own employees.

And we think

10

that when the First Circuit said that that is

11

unambiguously not covered by the statute, that it's

12

wrong.

13

covered and asking some of these ­­ or answering some of

14

these questions about the limit.

15

But moving beyond that, assuming that that is

First of all, as Justice Scalia suggested,

16

the statute applies to individuals who are in a position

17

who have information about fraud or securities law

18

violations are in a position to report it.

company, not the contractor doing some other type of

14

work.

15

So that it's talking about the

So if the contractor's work is for the

16

public company and there is fraud being committed by the

17

contractor, yes, that is something that Congress was

18

concerned about.

19

Arthur Andersen was committing fraud, not against Enron.

20

It was concerned about the fact that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

But you think this is

21

limited to ­­ to fraud by the contractor relating to the

22

public company, not ­­ not fraud that has nothing to do

23

with the public company.

24

MS. SAHARSKY:

25

I think that it can be fraud

by the contractor while the contractor is fulfilling its

role as a contractor for the public company, not the

2

contractor in some other capacity.

it does cover all employers.

It did, Your Honor.

And as I

said, 150 times "accountants" appear.

8

If I could just finish with this point.

9

Senate report lists four examples of the so­called

The

10

corporate code of silence:

11

Vinson and Elkins lawyers, the UBS securities analyst,

12

and Sharon Watkins at Enron.

13

The Andersen partner, the

Congress dealt with them in four different

14

provisions:

15

307 for the lawyers, Section 501 for the securities

16

analysts, and Section 806 for the public company

17

employee.

18

either ­­ it added, for good measure, Section 1107,

19

which says whoever shall retaliate against anybody who

20

provides information to a law enforcement officer, which

21

includes the SEC, is subject to a criminal offense under

22

Title 18.

23

Section 105 for the accountants, section

And then ­­ we haven't talked about this yet,

So we have this interlocking, connected,

24

nested series of provisions that deals with each of the

25

concerns identified by Congress in an industry­specific

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fashion.

2

intimate, hint, that, oh, by regulating these things,

3

the lawyers, the accountants, the securities analysts

4

and the public companies, that they also were going to

5

sweep in 6 million private employers.

6

And at no point did Congress suggest,

And if a member of Congress, I would submit,

7

had stood up on the floor and suggested that, it would

8

have been met with debate, derision, and defeat.

9

The First Circuit's judgment, Your Honors,

10

should be affirmed.

Thank you.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Mr. Schnapper, you have five minutes left.

13
14

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

16

Let me begin by just referring the Court to

Thank you, Your Honor.

17

some materials that might be relevant to some of the

18

questions you asked.

19

prior to this case coming to this Court, those views

20

were expressed in a separate brief the SEC filed in the

21

First Circuit, which is consistent with the government's

22

approach here.

23
24
25

With regard to the SEC's view

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we know they

don't have rulemaking authority in this area.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

I agree with that, but ­­

55

but the question came up about what their views were.

2

With regard to the suggestion earlier that

3

the ARB has taken the position that every contract ­­

4

every firm that has a contract with a public company is

5

a contractor.

6

mentioned in both the Respondent's brief and our yellow

7

brief, the ­­ the ARB is for the opposite position

8

and ­­ and took a position, I think, consistent with

9

the view we've advanced, which is not every contract

10
11

Actually, in the Fleszar case, which is

renders you a contractor.
With regard to Arthur Andersen, the

12

discussion in the Senate Report about why there's a need

13

to deal with retaliation is repeatedly about Arthur

14

Andersen.

15

what was going on at ­­ at Enron were Arthur Andersen

16

employees, not most of the run­of­the­mill employees at

17

Enron, and they were the ones who remained silent in the

18

face of this very, very serious problem.

19

Many of the people who actually understood

With regard to the origins of this phrase

20

contractor, my brother, Mr. Perry, was right, it comes

21

from AIR­21.

22

regarding what it means were issued prior to the

23

adoption of SOX and they said it included employers ­­

24

employees of employers, which has remained the view of

25

the agency throughout.

The preliminary AIR­21 regulations

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

My colleague ­­ with regard to AIR­21, the

2

history here is, I think, important.

3

referred to air carriers and contractors and

4

subcontractors, and the court below assumed that that

5

meant that employees of subcontractors and contractors

6

were covered.

7

This statute

The First Circuit's theory was that Congress

8

meant to narrow the meaning of contractor employees

9

because it added retaliation by officers and employees.

10

And it seems to me that that is precisely the wrong

11

conclusion.

12

When Congress added to the entities that

13

could not retaliate, when it rewrote AIR­21 to add some

14

other people that couldn't retaliate, it didn't mean to

15

tacitly then eliminate the employees of contractors who

16

were governed under AIR­21.

17

Finally, with regard to the question the

18

Court has raised about whether it should explore the

19

possibility of a limitation based on whether a

20

contractor was acting as a contractor, we think it would

21

probably not be prudent to take that on at this time for

22

a couple of reasons.

23

First of all, a fair amount of work that was

24

done by Arthur Andersen was not ­­ that was relevant

25

wasn't done for Enron.

It was done for the

57

3

places where the debts were being hidden.

you'd get into that problem.

Secondly, this provision is adopted against

6

the background of a series of executive orders, most

7

important which is Executive Order 11246, about racial

8

discrimination by Federal contractors.

9

That executive order has always been

10

understood to cover all the employees of the contractor,

11

not just the employees who are working on the government

12

project.

13

background.

14

Branch hasn't limited it to that.

15

And I think that's an important part of the
Congress has not tried to ­­ the Executive

And in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of

16

about 1986, Congress rewrote Title 6 and Title 9 to have

17

institution­wide application rather than to do little

18

parts of it.

19

This issue about what a contractor might be

20

doing as a contractor hasn't been vetted in lower courts

21

and we think it would be not prudent to try to ­­ to

22

take that on here.

23

Thank you very much.
