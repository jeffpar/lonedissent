Mr. Streett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. STREETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Basic v. Levinson should be overruled

12

because it was wrong when it was decided and it is even

13

more clearly erroneous today.

14

economic theory for the bedrock common law requirement

15

of actual reliance that Congress embraced in the most

16

analogous express cause of action.

17

Basic substituted

Basic's judicially created presumption

18

preserves an unjustified exemption from Rule 23 that

19

benefits only securities plaintiffs.

20

unworkable, has been undermined by later developments,

21

and has proven to have harmful consequences for

22

investors and companies alike.

23
24
25

Basic has proven

The most direct course is to overrule Basic
altogether and require a showing of actual reliance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I believe that in Basic,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Blackmun said that there is this economic

2

theory, but also the motivation for the Exchange Act and

3

probability and common sense would lead to this

4

presumption ­­ this rebuttable presumption.

5

wasn't relying strictly on an economic theory.

6

two or three times in the opinion, he tries to make that

7

plain.

8
9

MR. STREETT:

So he
I think

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the

Court in Basic recognized that Section 18(a) was the

10

proper analog, but then it immediately turned to its own

11

notions of public policy and the best way to further

12

congressional policy, instead of asking what sort of

13

reliance does Section 18(a) require.

14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is that, that it

says that 18(a) is the proper ­­

MR. STREETT:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. STREETT:

I believe ­­
­­ reference?
I believe it's on page 245

19

where the Court says, "We acknowledge the argument that

20

Section 18(a) is the proper analog, and we accept that

21

there is a reliance requirement under 10(b)."

22

But the Court then jumps to creating a

23

presumption of reliance, rather than asking what sort of

24

reliance Section 18(a) requires, which has always been

25

understood to be actual eyeball reliance.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Streett, that argument,

2

of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong

3

in ­­ in ­­ in not focusing on ­­ on Section 18, and

4

that's contestable.

5

right not to focus on Section 18, Section 9 is the

6

closer analog.

7

One could say actually, they were

But let's put that aside.

Are you just

8

saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something

9

has changed since Basic?

Because usually that's what we

10

look for when we decide whether to reverse a case,

11

something that makes the question fundamentally

12

different now than when we decided it.

13

especially so in a case like this one where Congress has

14

had every opportunity, and has declined every

15

opportunity, to change Basic itself.

16

So what has changed, in your view?

17

MR. STREETT:

And that's

We're saying both that it was

18

wrong when decided and that certain things have changed.

19

At least three things, Your Honor.

20

First of all, this Court has fundamentally

21

changed its approach to interpreting the Section 10(b)

22

cause of action.

23

narrowly, and Basic stands out like a sore thumb among

24

that jurisprudence.

25

It's consistently construed it

Second, this Court has consistently held in

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Comcast and Wal­Mart that there cannot be presumptions

2

of classwide issues; instead, classwide issues must be

3

proved in fact.

4

in those cases who purported to establish class ­­

5

classwide methodologies, and the Court tested those with

6

rigor to determine whether they proved, in fact, that

7

there were classwide issues.

8
9

The Court addressed plaintiff's experts

And we're asking this Court to give the
Basic presumptions the same rigor that this Court gave

10

the expert reports in Comcast and Wal­Mart, at the very

11

least because those ­­ those expert reports only

12

generated one class action.

13

all ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. STREETT:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

And this has underlined

What is your third?
Pardon?
You said three.

What is

your third?

18

MR. STREETT:

19

economics have changed.

20

in particular, the premise that investors rely in common

21

on the integrity of the market price.

22

and the fund do not even contend, they don't even

23

contest that that's the case anymore.

24

such as hedge fund rapid­fire volatility traders, index

25

fund investors, sophisticated value investors do not ­­

Yes.

And my third is that the

The economic premises of Basic,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

The government

Many investors,

Official

1

they have investment strategies that do not rely on the

2

integrity of the market price whatsoever.

3

of reliance is the quintessential individualized

4

issue ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that sort

So ­­ so you are not relying

6

anymore on the notion that the efficient markets

7

hypothesis has been undermined.

8

three points that you're making because, essentially, I

9

think you ­­ you admit this in your reply brief.

That is not one of the

You

10

just say Halliburton has never said that market prices

11

­­ has never contested that market prices generally

12

respond to new material information.

13
14
15
16
17

So you are agreeing with that, that market
prices generally do respond to new material information.
MR. STREETT:

Cited at that general ­­

general level, we don't disagree with it.
The problem is that we now know that a

18

binary yes­or­no approach to market efficiency like the

19

sentence you read tells us very little about whether a

20

particular misrepresentation distorted the market price.

21

So Basic has become inconsistent with its own premises.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but we don't have that

23

kind of binary approach.

24

is to try to establish a presumption, which they do by

25

showing that a particular market is efficient, and then

What we allow plaintiffs to do

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we allow defendants to rebut that presumption.

2

So there's no binary on/off switch.

It's

3

actually ­­ it's a presumption, but it's quite dependent

4

on the facts in a particular case as to whether there's

5

an exception to this general rule that market prices, in

6

fact, do generally respond to new material information.

7

MR. STREETT:

It's ­­ it's binary in the

8

sense that the principal driver of class certification

9

is whether the market is efficient in a yes­or­no,

10

binary sense, and that's why we have raised our second

11

position, which is if the Court were inclined to keep

12

the presumption in some sense, it should at least place

13

the burden on the plaintiff to establish that the

14

misrepresentation actually distorted the market price,

15

or to give defendants the full right of rebuttal at the

16

class certification stage to establish the price was not

17

impacted.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do we know how often

19

defendants have been successful in rebutting the

20

presumption?

21

MR. STREETT:

It is ­­ it is virtually

22

impossible.

23

the Second Circuit which allows rebuttal with respect to

24

price impact.

25

of the amicus briefs said, they're as rare as hen's

It's very unusual outside of the context of

Outside of that circuit, I think as one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

teeth.

2

And that is another development.

Certainly

3

this Court in Basic thought the fact that the

4

presumption was rebuttable was an essential part of that

5

holding, and it now turns out the courts, especially the

6

court below in this case, have treated it as essentially

7

irrebuttable, even with respect to the fundamental

8

premise of Basic, which is price impact.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And we are not aware of a

20

single instance in which this Court allowed a

21

presumption to be invoked for the very purpose of one

22

stage of litigation, but held that the defendant's right

23

to rebut must be delayed to a later stage.

24

can be no doubt that Basic created the presumption of

reliance, among other reasons, for the very purpose of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I ­­ I understand

3

your friend on the other side to acknowledge that the

4

efficient market theory is not perfect, that there are

5

situations in which events are not reflected in the

6

market price.

I understand you to acknowledge that it's

8

accurate to some extent, but that the exceptions or

you're each sort of dealing with at the ­­ at the ­­ if

16

In other words,

How am I supposed to review the economic
literature and decide which of you is correct on that?

district judges to make this binary, yes­or­no market

No, your submission

22

23

economists now believe that the efficient market theory

24

is not sufficient ­­ sufficiently accurate or true to

the economic literature in your briefs.

2

wanted me to look at it.

3

MR. STREETT:

I assume you

Of course, our principal

4

submission is that no economic theory should supplant

5

what Congress enacted in Section 18(a) in the most

And with that

I'd like to get –

JUSTICE KAGAN: Could you explain ­­

11

which isn't part of the class, that would entitle them

12

to a different calculation of loss causation.

13

MR. STREETT:

A plaintiff within the class

could still establish loss causation without price

impact in the same way that a plaintiff in the class

somebody who no representation was made to that person

Well, if one is a member of this class that

MR. STREETT:

I'm relying on a case where

12

the misrepresentation was made in a way that's typical

13

to the class, but individual class members purchased off

14

of the exchange, and therefore they purchased at a

15

different price, perhaps, than what was on the exchange.

16

But I think the real point is that this

17

Court emphasized and held in Amgen that plaintiffs

could ­­ that plaintiffs did need to establish that the

19

market was efficient and that the statement was public.

information, and it’s a general rule, they do incorporate

13

most information.

14

We think they incorporate this

The other side wants to show they didn't

incorporate this.

is, is it a common issue, and it's not a red herring to

throw in whether the markets incorporate information

because normally they do, period.

20

with what I said?

21

MR. STREETT:

That's fine.

It's a common issue.
All we're trying to say

Now, what's wrong

Because market efficiency and

22

publicity are also common issues that this Court

23

required to be considered at the class certification

24

stage.

25

considered because they are predicates for price impact.

And this Court required those issues to be

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, we've required them to

be considered because ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's certainly not the rule

4

­­ it's certainly not the rule that every ­­ every issue

5

that is common has ­­ has to be decided at the

6

preliminary ­­ or I'm sorry, must be left to the merits.

7

I mean, as you point out, the very issue of whether the

8

market is efficient is something that could be decided

9

for everybody at the merits stage, right?

10

MR. STREETT:

That's absolutely correct.

11

And the reason this Court allowed market efficiency and

12

publicity to be considered is because without those

13

predicates, there's no reason to presume that there's

14

price impact.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Streett, there's a ­­

16

there's a real difference with respect to those issues

17

and I think that this was really what Amgen said.

18

said that when you rule on those things, it essentially

19

splits up the class so that different members of the

20

class are left in very different positions; but that

21

when you rule on a question like materiality, which

22

leaves all members of the class in the exact same

23

position, either with a viable claim or with no claim,

24

and it doesn't split the class in the way that the

25

efficient markets theory do, that's the difference.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

And here ­­ and this goes back to Justice

2

Sotomayor's question ­­ I just don't see how this splits

3

the class at all, because if you can't prove price

4

impact, you can't prove loss causation and everybody's

5

claims die.

6

MR. STREETT:

Well, that same argument could

7

have been made against market efficiency or publicity.

8

If you don't have a public statement reaching the

9

market, there's no way the price could have been

10
11

impacted.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think that the ­­

12

that the difference is that even if you don't have

13

market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring

14

the ­­ a claim with the fraud­on­the­market presumption,

15

you might still have an individual reliance claim.

16

MR. STREETT:

Yes.

And if the market price

17

was not distorted, you could still have an individual

18

reliance claim for exactly the same reasons.

19

market's not efficient or the statement is not public,

20

you are, by necessity, not going to have price impact.

21

So market efficiency and publicity are precisely,

22

exactly situated with respect to price impact.

If the

23

And the result of disallowing price impact

24

evidence at the class certification stage, which this

25

Court said was Basic's fundamental premise, would mean

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

automatic class certification for all New York Stock

2

Exchange companies, because those companies trade in an

3

efficient market in the binary, yes­or­no sense that

4

5
6
7

And that cannot be what this Court ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Finish your sentence.

"And that cannot" ­­
MR. STREETT:

Cannot be what this Court

8

intended in Basic when it created a rebuttable

9

presumption.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you address briefly

11

the position taken by the law professors, I call it the

12

midway position, that says there should be an event

13

study.

14

arguments of the narrow construction of 10(b)(5), and

15

the question of presumptions, but it does seem to me to

16

be a substantial answer to your economic analysis to

17

the ­­ to the challenge you make to the economic

18

premises of the Basic decision.

19

That might not take care of your first two

MR. STREETT:

Yes.

Our principal argument

20

is that the economic theories should not serve as a

21

stand­in for actual reliance.

22

accept the continuing validity of the presumption in

23

some way, the law professors' position, which is also

24

our second question presented, at least makes Basic

25

consistent with its own premises.

But if the Court were to

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Because Basic's

Official

1

premise is if a plaintiff buys at a price that is

2

distorted by the misrepresentation, he has relied upon

3

the misrepresentation.

4

premise, then it only makes sense to focus like a laser

5

on the only relevant question, whether the

6

misrepresentation distorted the market price.

7

If we accept that as Basic's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Am ­­ am I correct ­­ and

8

this would be more of a question for your friend

9

representing the Respondent.

Am I correct that, even

10

under the ­­ the Basic framework, at the merits stage

11

there has to be something that looks very much like an

12

event study.

13
14
15

Am I correct about that?

MR. STREETT:

Yes.

That's absolutely

correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so then the question

16

would be since you're going to have to have it anyway,

17

why not have it at the class certification stage.

18

MR. STREETT:

Yes.

And the Second Circuit

19

has correctly held that that must be proven at the class

20

certification stage because price impact is the glue

21

that holds common reliance together and the district

22

courts within that circuit have been very

23

successfully ­­

2

whole premise of the other economic theory that you rely

on is that the market efficiency is irrelevant.

4

information impacts the market, whether efficient or

not, and some doesn't, whether efficient or not.

think that's the basic economic argument the other

MR. STREETT:

Because if market efficiency

23

to plead an efficient market and would immediately go,

you know, to collect $200 and pass go and get right to

25

class certification.

That cannot be what Basic meant

23
Alderson Reporting Company

when it said the presumption of reliance depends on

2

plaintiffs relying in common on a misrepresentation that

3

distorted the market price.

evidence can be considered at the class certification

JUSTICE ALITO:

about these event studies to which you referred?

How

10

accurately can they distinguish between the effect of

13

least temporarily, to the facts contained in the

14

15

MR. STREETT:

Event studies are very

16

effective at making that sort of determination.

17

fact, in this particular case, the expert testified that

18

she had done that sort of separation of effects before,

19

but she was not asked to do so in this case.

22

In

And the law professors and others have

But in any event, that's a proper burden to

23

place on the plaintiff because they are the ones that

24

are invoking this powerful presumption to bypass the

25

requirement of common actual reliance.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

They are the

Official

1

ones who should have to show that it's the

2

misrepresentation that distorted the market price and

3

not some other irrational reaction.

4

But I wanted to mention that at page 26 of

5

the government's brief and page 53 of the Fund's brief,

6

they concede that price impact evidence should come in

7

at class certification, but they want to make it only

8

one factor in determining whether the markets were

9

efficient.

Well, why would you spend all of your time

10

looking at market efficiency and looking at price impact

11

as only one factor, instead of looking at the thing that

12

actually matters, whether the price was distorted.

with respect to SLUSA, it acted on the assumption that

side that wanted to overrule Basic and the other side

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But even if Basic did not

rely on economic theory, and there is a dispute on

that ­­ I think the opinion is not quite clear on that

8

one way or the other ­­ if later economic theories show

9

that the market doesn't react in the way Basic assumed

10

it automatically did, then certainly Congress would not

11

wish to foreclose the Court from considering that new

12

evidence if it was a strong, clear and convincing, et

13

cetera.

14

MR. BOIES:

Well, first ­­ first, Your

15

Honor, I would ­­ I'd say three things about that.

16

First, I would say that Basic's premise is not an

17

economic theory.

18

It is a premise of Congress.

19

and I think correctly held, that the ­­ the whole

20

premise of the securities laws is that when you make

21

fraudulent misrepresentations, you make them public, it

22

affects the market price.

23

It's not a premise of economic theory.
That's what Basic held,

The second thing is there hasn't been

24

anything that has changed since Basic that makes Basic

25

less applicable.

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, Mr. Boies, to say that

2

false representation affects the market price is quite

3

different from saying that it affects the market price

4

almost immediately, and it's hard to see how the Basic

5

theory can be sustained unless it does affect the market

6

price almost immediately in what Basic described as an

7

efficient market.

8

who purchased the stock on the day, shortly, you know,

9

an hour or two after the disclosure, be entitled to

Isn't that true?

Why should someone

10

recovery if in that particular market there is some lag

11

time in incorporating the new information?

12

MR. BOIES:

I think ­­ I think Your Honor is

13

right that if there is lag time in a particular market,

14

somebody who has purchased immediately after the

15

misrepresentation would not be entitled to recover.

16

However, in this case and in most cases that isn't an

17

issue, because in most cases what the class­action

18

period is, is something that gives all of the

19

misrepresentations full­time to permeate into the

20

market.

21

So it is theoretically possible that you

22

could have a market where there is a lag time.

23

Although, I will say that since Basic was decided that

lag time has gotten shorter and shorter.

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

I'd like to begin by addressing two of the

6

respects in which the Petitioners' counsel argued that

7

circumstances have changed since this Court's decision

8

in Basic.

9

investors have adopted new strategies that, in his view,

And the first ­­ one of these was that

10

don't rely on the integrity of the market price.

11

think it's certainly true that investors have devised a

12

wide array of strategies in an effort to beat the

13

market, but it's hard to imagine one that would render

14

irrelevant evidence that the market price had been

15

distorted by fraud.

16

And I

For example, a particular investor might

17

think there are particular types of information that the

18

market doesn't react to quickly enough, and if I'm

19

following that information in realtime and I can trade

20

before the market catches on, then I can make money; I

21

can buy low and sell high.

22

certainly going to be undermined if there is other

23

information bearing on the market price, the falsity of

24

which that investor is not aware of that caused the

25

market price to be inflated.

Now, that strategy is

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now, I'd ­­ would agree with you, Justice

2

Alito, that in theory, there could be an investor who

3

says in a particular circumstance, I think the gain that

4

I can make by taking advantage of the new information to

5

which the market price has not yet reacted will more

6

than counterbalance the loss I will suffer when the

7

truth about the unrelated information comes to light.

8

That could happen, but even for an investor of that

9

sort, the distortion wouldn't be irrelevant.

10
11

It would

just be a factor that could be counteractive.
And the other thing I would say about the

12

efficiency of the market is that even an investor who is

13

attempting to make money by being the first to take

14

advantage of new information is relying, in essence, on

15

the ultimate ability and tendency of the market to

16

incorporate the information; that is, an investor who

17

thinks that a stock is currently undervalued based on

18

the information he has presumably thinks that in time,

19

the ­­ the stock will no longer be undervalued, the

20

market will come to appreciate the significance of the

21

new information.

22

anticipating that the stock price will rise.

23

even that strategy is dependent in a fundamental way on

24

the propensity of new information to ­­ to change the

25

market price.

That would be the basis for his

43
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

The second thing I wanted to respond to was

2

Petitioners' assertion that Basic is out of keeping with

3

this Court's more recent decisions regarding the

4

requirements of Rule 23.

5

­­ at least with respect to the interaction between the

6

merits and Rule 23, the court in Basic did precisely

7

what this Court's decisions in Wal­Mart and Comcast tell

8

courts they ought to do; that is, the Court in Basic was

9

ruling on an appeal from a class certification decision,

10

and it was confronted with two competing visions of what

11

the reliance requirement of the Section 10(b) action

12

should comprise.

13

And I think that in fact, with

One of them was the defendant's view that to

14

establish reliance, a plaintiff had to show that he or

15

she actually read the relevant disclosure and took it

16

into account in making a trading decision.

17

vision of reliance was the fraud­on­the­market

18

presumption that the ­­ the court ultimately adopted.

19

And the court in Basic recognized that it had to decide

20

this merits question at the class certification stage

21

because the answer to that question would control

22

whether the reliance element was susceptible of common

23

proof.

12

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I

Could you explain how the

14

requirement that Basic imposed of proving publicity at

15

the certification stage is consistent with the Court's

16

theory in Amgen?

17

MR. STEWART:

I think the ­­ the theory in

18

Amgen is that in order to decide whether something has

19

to be proved at the class certification stage, you ask

20

first, is it susceptible of common proof; and second, if

21

the class is certified and the ­­ the statement or the

22

fact is ultimately disproved down the road, is the

23

effect going to be that the class splinters or that all

24

plaintiffs lose in common?

25

Amgen, the rationale for saying that publicity had to be

And the Court's theory in

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proved at the class certification stage, was that if it

2

were proved down the road that the statement was not

3

made publicly, some plaintiffs might still have good

4

claims because they would have heard and relied upon the

5

information even though it wasn't communicated to the

6

public, and therefore the effect of disproof of

7

publicity would not be to cause all class members to

8

lose, it would be to cause the class to splinter.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that's a

10

realistic ­­ that that is something that's likely to

11

happen in other than extremely rare cases?

12

MR. STEWART:

Well, there ­­ there are

13

certainly plenty of securities fraud cases over the

14

years that involved private misrepresentations made

15

one­on­one by a broker, a salesperson, et cetera.

it is the case that the recoveries in the large class

If Basic were overruled, what

Well, let me take the first

part first, because I think in part it illustrates an

important aspect of this case that tends to get lost.

We are arguing about this as though it's procedure, but

16

really what is fundamentally at issue is what is the

17

class of, what is the category of investors who would

18

have a potentially valid Section 10(b)(5) action.

19

is, the Petitioners' view is the only people who could

20

be proper plaintiffs in a Section ­­ in a private

21

Section 10(b) suit, whether a class action or an

22

individual action, are people who personally read,

24

information.

And the view on the other side, the view

Alderson Reporting Company

That

2

stock at the inflated price on the market, a price

3

inflated by fraud, and subsequently lost money as a

result when the truth was made known, any such person

5

would have a remedy; and if Basic were overruled, if
