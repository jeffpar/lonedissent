Mr. Bucholtz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In holding that the ­­ in holding that

12

Respondents could bring this Bivens lawsuit against

13

Officer Anthony Walden in Nevada, the Ninth Circuit made

14

two errors that independently require a reversal.

15

First, as to personal jurisdiction, the

16

Ninth Circuit held that it was sufficient that

17

Respondents have connections to Nevada, and that Officer

18

Walden allegedly targeted his conduct at them, knowing

19

of their contacts with Nevada.

20

approach is inconsistent with this Court's precedence

21

which emphasize that the defendant himself must have

22

meaningful contacts with the forum State.

23

That plaintiff­centered

Second, as to venue, the Ninth Circuit

24

relied on the fact that the Respondents felt in Nevada

25

the effects of Officer Walden's alleged conduct in

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Georgia.

2

is in conflict with the text of the venue statute,

3

1391(b)(2), which focuses on where the events or

4

omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, not where

5

the impact of those events or omissions may be felt.

6

That, similarly, Plaintiff­centered approach

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have any preference

7

as to which of those errors you would like us to rely

8

on?

9

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

10

think, for the reasons set out in the Federal Law

11

Enforcement Officers' amicus brief, which I will try to

12

explain, I think that it would be preferable for the

13

Court to address personal jurisdiction and not just

14

venue, that the reason is that venue in removed cases

15

works differently.

16

removed cases.

17

There really is no venue, per se, in

And so if the Court only reaches venue here,

18

holds that venue is improper, in theory ­­ and maybe

19

there are limitations problems with this, but in theory,

20

the plaintiffs could refile the same lawsuit in State

21

court in Nevada.

22

arise under Federal law, so we would remove it.

It would be a Bivens lawsuit; it would

23

But then removal would mean, under 1441(a),

24

venue would be proper, per se, in the district of

25

removal because that's the way removal works, and this

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Court so held in Polizzi half a century ago.
And then there would be no personal

3

jurisdiction, and then the personal jurisdiction would

4

be under the Ninth Circuit's decision, and we'd be back

5

exactly where we are now.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the venue

7

question does not ­­ does not bring into the Court a

8

constitutional question and the jurisdictional ­­ the

9

jurisdictional one does.

10

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

constitutional questions.

13

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

That's true.
And we usually try to avoid

That's true.

And the

14

avoidance canon is certainly one factor the Court could

15

take into account in deciding which issue to reach ­­ or

16

which issues to reach or in what order.

17

On the other hand, the personal jurisdiction

18

question is ­­ is a constitutional question, but it's

19

not a constitutional question in the strong sense of the

20

term because the only reason that the ­­ the personal

21

jurisdiction question, as applied in this case, is a

22

constitutional one is because Congress hasn't provided

23

for nationwide service of process for Bivens claims.

24

And as the Court pointed out in Omni

25

Capital, the Congress has the power to do that.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official

1

not for the Court to do that on its own, to fill a

2

perceived policy gap in personal jurisdiction law.

3

And so, even though it is a constitutional

4

question as currently configured, if Congress thought

5

that it were a problem to apply the existing personal

6

jurisdiction jurisprudence to Bivens claims and wanted

7

to provide for nationwide service of process based on

8

the idea that what counts is contacts with the U.S. as a

9

whole, as opposed to any particular State.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not likely, is it,

11

considering that the Bivens claim was created by this

12

Court and not Congress.

13

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

14

Congress should do that.

15

that.

16

Honor just stated, is ­­ is sort of the last place

17

that ­­ that anyone should start to create a more

18

plaintiff­friendly version of personal jurisdiction.

19

The Court has gone ­­ I'm sorry, Your Honor.

20

I'm not suggesting that
I think Congress should not do

I think Bivens claims, for the reason that Your

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You ­­ you would not have

21

any problem about ­­ assuming we agree with you that

22

it's ­­ there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong

23

venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the

24

case to the Federal district court in Georgia?

25

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, I think,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg, in the ordinary course, in a ­­ in a

2

case starting in district court, under Section 1631

3

or ­­ or the venue statute, that would be an appropriate

4

course.

5

Here, the district court asked Respondents

6

specifically, if I agree with Officer Walden on personal

7

jurisdiction or venue, do you want me to transfer, or do

8

you want me to dismiss?

9

district court discretion and ­­ and says, in the

Because the statute gives the

10

interest of justice, transfer is ­­ is permissible in

11

lieu of dismissal.

12

The Respondents said, emphatically, we don't

13

want you to transfer.

14

they ­­ they decided they would rather have an appeal to

15

the Ninth Circuit and take their ­­ their chances

16

with ­­ with an appeal, then pursue the case in Georgia.

17

So I think under the unusual ­­

18

We want you to dismiss.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess

That's probably ­­

19

it turned out to be a good ­­ good strategy, at least to

20

the extent they got to the Ninth Circuit.

21

Isn't Calder against Jones in considerable

22

tension with your proposition that you don't look to the

23

plaintiff's contacts with the forum?

24
25

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think there ­­ there is definitely some language in

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Calder that could be read in a variety of ways.

2

the key language in Calder ­­ excuse me ­­ as the Court

3

states its conclusions, it says, "In sum, California was

4

the focal point both of the article and of the harm

5

suffered by the plaintiffs."

6

I think

And then the Court later says that ­­ that

7

the defendants expressly aimed their conduct at

8

California.

9

happened to be in California; it says at California.

It doesn't say at the plaintiff, who

10

And I think that's not an accident, that the Court used

11

those formulations.

12

In all of the personal jurisdiction cases

13

before Calder and since ­­ and, for that matter, decided

14

the same day, in Keeton ­­ decided the same day as

15

Calder, the Court has emphasized that random,

16

attenuated, and fortuitous contacts with the forum State

17

are insufficient and that, in particular, contacts

18

between the defendant and the ­­ and the forum that are

19

created by the unilateral activity of the plaintiff are

20

not sufficient.

21

So ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you think the Court

22

meant when it said that the ­­ the article was aimed at

23

California?

24
25

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

I think what the Court meant,

Justice Alito, is that the article was distributed in

California, and California was, by far, the largest

2

market for the National Enquirer.

6

The article recounted

And the article was drawn from California

So it's not fortuitous that the effect of

the article was felt in California.

8

the defendants knew that the article would be

It was the National

16

And why does California, as an abstract

17

entity, care about an article that makes allegedly

18

defamatory statements about things that people

19

supposedly did in California?

20

that.

21

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

I don't quite understand

Well, let me try to answer

22

the first part of your question first, Justice Alito.

23

It's true that the National Enquirer was national; it

24

was distributed throughout the country.

25

went ­­ went to pains in the opinion to emphasize that

9
Alderson Reporting Company

But the Court

Official

2

California was the largest market.
And so when the Court said the brunt of the

3

harm ­­ that ­­ this is right after the Court's

4

reference to express aiming, where the Court says ­­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

everything, isn't it?

7

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

It's the largest market for

Well, I think particularly for the

8

National Enquirer, when you're talking about articles

9

about celebrities, about actresses in particular, that

10

allegedly injure their professional reputation and

11

prevent them from getting future acting jobs.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't understand.

13

Are you suggesting if this ­­ everything was the same,

14

except Ms. Jones was in New York, there'd be a different

15

result in that case?

16
17
18

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

No, I'm not suggesting that.

I think that ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought,

19

several times, you said California was the biggest

20

market.

21

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Right.

I think ­­ I think

22

the way that ­­ that Calder reads, I think that there

23

are a number of factors.

One of them is plaintiff's

24

residence in California.

That's where she was when she

25

suffered the emotional distress from ­­ from reading

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the article about herself and where her job prospects

2

were ­­ were allegedly adversely affected.

3

But it's also true the Court points out that

4

not only is ­­ when the Court says the defendants

5

expressly aimed their conduct at California, the next

6

passage after that, where the Court explains what

7

that ­­ what express aiming at California means, it says

8

California was not only where ­­ where Ms. Jones

9

suffered the brunt of the harm, but where the defendants

10

knew that the Enquirer had its largest circulation.

11

So I don't think you can disentangle the

12

fact that that's where she was, which, of course, was a

13

relevant factor in that case because it was true, from

14

the fact that the defendants, in a broader sense, in a

15

more ­­ in a sense not based on her unilateral activity,

16

but in a sense based on their own contacts, aimed at

17

California.

18

They drew their ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what does it mean ­­

20

what does it mean, in the context of an intentional

21

tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at

22

a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a

23

person who you know to be within that State?

24
25

I mean, nobody conducts an intentional tort
intending to injure California, per se.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

You're

Official

1

intending to injure a person who resides in California.

2

So what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a

3

State, irrespective of a person?

4

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

5

the answer is that it could take a few forms.

6

depends on the type of case.

7

to try to come up with the single ­­ you know, sort of

8

comprehensive unitary answer to that question that would

9

govern all types of cases.

10

It

It would be very difficult

I think the way that the plurality put it in

11

J. McIntyre, for intentional tort cases, is that maybe

12

you're intending to obstruct the laws of the forum

13

State.

14

forum State qua State and not just somebody who happens

15

to be in it or have a connection to it.

16

That would be more meaningfully aimed at the

Another way that conduct could be aimed at a

17

State would be if ­­ if it's a species of purposeful

18

availment or purposeful direction, where you're

19

projecting your conduct into that State, whether

20

that's ­­ whether that's physical and literal or whether

21

it's ­­ it's through some indirect or technological

22

means for ­­

Well, suppose ­­ suppose ­­

MR. BUCHOLTZ:

­­ for some benefit, for some

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason, where you're projecting your conduct into that

2

State, not just because that's where the plaintiff

3

happens to be, which is incidental and irrelevant to you

4

that the plaintiff is there, as opposed to anywhere

5

else, but because you're seeking that State out.

6

That could be ­­ it could be, in a case like

7

J. McIntyre, the Court, of course, divided over whether

8

9

the stream of commerce, intending that it in some

10

sense ­­ you know, go to the U.S. as a whole, without

11

any particular focus on a given State, was sufficient.

12

But at least there ­­ at least there, you

13

have the intent to serve the U.S. market as a whole.

14

And so you at least are on notice that your own conduct

15

is putting you at risk of being haled into court in any

16

one of the States.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

I mean, I guess I

18

just ­­ the ­­ the McIntyre example is a very different

19

kind of example because, in those cases, you really are

talking about a company seeking to serve a general

fact that they chose a lawyer in Nevada, and that's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was ­­ it was

false affidavit keeps them there.

So

So I didn't think there was a ­­ a genuine

7

difference between the parties on whether the

affidavit ­­ knowingly composing a false affidavit is an

9

independent claim.

10

MS. SHERRY:

There isn't for purposes of ­­

11

of this case in this Court, and I don't mean to suggest

12

otherwise, but while there may be a distinct claim,

13

there is no distinct injury.

14

Respondents allege based on the affidavit is simply that

15

the initial seizure continued beyond the time that it

otherwise would have.

17

The injury that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But imagine a case where

21

everybody agreed that the initial seizure was lawful, so

22

that that wasn't part of the complaint at all, and the

23

only complaint was that a false affidavit had been

filed, so that, after making the preliminary

determination; but not only did they rely on it, they

to go to Washington, D.C., to sue her?

I do think, if you can

prove an injury, which I think is very hard from the

gold watch ­­ let's say a computer, just to make it a

injury, which isn't ­­ the tort doesn't arise until the

injury occurs.

That's why the lower courts treat these
cases as the tort occurring where the victim is.

Mr. Goldstein, can I take

you back to the origins of all of this?

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
The main move for

personal jurisdiction, traditionally, is the plaintiff

must go to where the defendant is, no matter how

20

inconvenient that is for the plaintiff.

defendant­centered.

22

about McIntyre and then try and correct the

misimpression that I think that's been left, that there

19

are a few contacts between Nevada and this case and

hopefully prove to you that there are far more contacts

21

between this tort and this forum than will be true in

22

the overwhelming majority of cases that the lower courts

23

confront.

24
25

And the point I would make, Justice
Ginsburg, and it's made by the plurality in McIntyre, is

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there have always been special rules for

2

intentional tort cases.

3

that's why Calder comes out the way it does, citing

4

restatement Section 32nd of the second ­­ the second

5

restatement of the conflict of laws, and that is the

6

reason ­­ it's not just made up.

7

That's the distinction, and

The reason there's a special rule for

8

intentional torts is that the defendant knows he's

9

hurting someone somewhere else and, therefore, expects

10

to be haled into court.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Now, if I could just help you understand our

view that there are a lot more contacts between this

tort and Nevada than in the great, great ­­ at least

6

90 percent of the cases the lower courts are

7

confronting.

8

about those contexts, and there are six, and I will try

9

and be brief.

10

So here are the points that I would make

The case involves money owned by Nevada

11

residents, $30,000 of which originated in Nevada, and

12

all of which was on its way to Nevada.

13

Second, the defendant intentionally hurt the

14

plaintiffs, knowing that they would lose access to the

15

money in Nevada, where they lived and worked.

16

Third, we will use documents in Nevada to

17

prove that his action was intentional because it omitted

18

the information that the defendant requested.

19

not a ­­ us unilaterally sending money.

20

airport, he said, send us the proof that the funds are

21

legitimate, that he requested and received from the

22

plaintiffs in Nevada and that he learned in searching a

23

Nevada law enforcement database, which is paragraph 79

24

of the complaint.

25

This is

At the Atlanta

The two last points I would make is that the

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiffs will show that they were deprived of the

2

money in Nevada until the Nevada lawyer they had to hire

3

used records in Nevada to persuade the government to

4

send the money to Nevada.

5

And the plaintiffs in their case, of course,

6

will show, because it is the fact that they are gamblers

7

working in Las Vegas, that the economic injury occurred

8

to them there.

9

Now, if you think that's not enough, if you

10

conclude that's not enough, you are closing the door

11

absolutely to all of the internet cases because those

12

are cases where someone sits at the computer and targets

13

someone in another State.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

This ­­
But, when you're talking

15

about the internet, you're in a different world.

16

this is a ­­ the facts here are old­fashioned.

17

Everything that happened here could have happened in

18

1920.

But

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could have happened in ­­ in

21

the 19th century.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

So I don't see what the

24
25

internet has to do with this.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Alito, you always

Alderson Reporting Company

1

tell us that you've got to write a legal rule, and there

2

is no special personal jurisdiction rule, and the lower

3

courts ­­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Well, there seems to

5

be because it's hard to think of an internet case where

6

a defendant wouldn't be having communications with

7

people in the foreign State, wouldn't be inviting

8

business, wouldn't be doing all kinds of things.

9

So there are many kinds of internet cases,

10

but I don't ­­ I don't automatically see, in deciding

11

this, that we're deciding any on ­­

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, the kinds of

13

internet cases ­­ and it's wrong for me to just say,

14

"internet" ­­ the kinds of cases that I'm talking about

15

are the fraud cases, the intentional tort cases ­­

9

Now, I have to offer you a solution.
just be clear.

Let me

I recognize that this can go either way

10

because if I say, "internet cases," well, then I'm

11

opening the door to potentially a very wide­ranging set

12

of cases going into Nevada, and we have here the special

case of the law enforcement officer, and I believe that

I do have the solution.

And in these cases, what defendants

uniformly do ­­ and the lower courts pay incredible

4

attention to the fact that law enforcement officers are

6

cases, the defendant comes in and says, okay, I

7

recognize, technically, there's jurisdiction and venue,

8

but let me tell you how disruptive it will be if I

9

actually have to litigate the case here.

You're saying that we should

I would not ­­

I do not want it reversed.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What

I know that, so that's why

I'm confused by what you're saying about transfer.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm trying to describe an

21

opinion that you would write, and the opinion that I

22

think you would write is this ­­ and it says, look,

23

personal jurisdiction in the wake of Calder,

24

particularly where there are contacts here, exists.

25

Venue exists because several of these are events and

48
Alderson Reporting Company

omissions, including the injury that occurs in Nevada.
But what we expect the lower courts to do in

a case like this is to pay particular attention at the

4

beginning of the case, as we do with qualified immunity,

5

to have an efficient process in which the defendant can

6

say ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are asking the

8

Court to decide a big­ticket item, personal

9

jurisdiction, and what ­­ the theory that you are

10

proposing would apply not to ­­ just to Officer Walden,

11

but it would be about as far out as any specific

12

jurisdiction case I know.

13

So the Court shouldn't say, well,

14

jurisdiction, okay, venue, okay, but consider it

15

transferring it to Georgia.

That seems, to me, wild.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, I am not

17

trying to just skip over.

I have talked for this entire

18

time about why I think we are right on jurisdiction and

19

venue, and I am pleased to return to the issue.

20

I'm suggesting to you is that I recognize that we can't

21

have ­­ there are two ways of dealing with the prospect

22

of a broad personal jurisdiction rule.

23

One is to narrow it substantially.

What

The

second is to recognize that it doesn't determine where

the case is going to ultimately be litigated.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

2

personally reviewing all of the post­Calder cases in the

3

Federal courts and the State courts, that the contacts

4

here are much, much greater between Nevada and this tort

5

than exists in the great majority of cases that the

6

lower courts are confronting.

7

And so if you ­­

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Did ­­ did Calder have

something to do with the notion that every defamation

10

is ­­ that every publication is a tort where it occurs?

11

There is something special about the libel cases.

12

was that theory that, wherever the paper that contains

13

the libelous article ­­ wherever it is sent, each one of

14

those places, the tort occurs there.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There

Two things about that.

That

is the rule for torts, not specifically ­­ it does ­­ it

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And, Justice ­­ that's

2

correct.

3

you were asking the question, why is it that

4

then­Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Calder has the

5

discussion that the other side is focusing on about how

6

the article was centered on California and how it came

7

from California sources.

8
9

And, Justice Scalia, this is exactly why ­­

Now, none of the holding of the case
describes it, but you wondered ­­ and he has emphasized,

10

my friend has, why is it in the opinion?

11

the reason you have just given.

12

and libel cases, when you are talking about the

13

publication to the internet or publication nationwide

14

like the National Enquirer, the lower courts have

15

rightly focused on the fact, can we say that this isn't

16

just directed to the United States?

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it's for

narrowing decision.

was published, which is where the injury occurs, but

We are saying the same

enough, and that is – the

Except it's harder for you

try my best.

6

cases about internet and national publications ­­ say

7

the New York Times is sued for defamation.

All right.

The reason these defamation

8

The Court was very concerned and the lower

9

courts are very concerned that the publisher can't be

10

sued in all 50 States.

11

have done in the wake of Calder is say, I know you

12

published it to the whole country, National Enquirer,

13

but is it fair to say you expected to be haled into

14

court in California because there were special features

15

about this defamation.

16

And so what the lowers courts

Now, defamation and nationwide publication

17

is very different from the other torts the lower courts

18

confront, which, as was suggested in the first 30

19

minutes of questioning, I think, by Justice Kagan, are

20

directed at a person, the "shoot the gun" example, the

21

"defraud the victim" example.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But our jurisdiction cases

23

have not been based on where you expected to be sued.

24

You could expect to be sued anywhere if the State says

25

you are going to be sued here.

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Our cases have focused on whether the State

2

has jurisdiction, whether the State has enough

3

connection with it to assert its power; not the

4

expectation of the defendant, but the power of the

5

State.

6

That's what's going on here.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, I agree with

7

you, but I will say in my defense that, when the Court

8

has said ­­ when we are trying to figure out if there

9

are minimum contacts and whether it's consistent with

10

fair play and substantial justice, the language the

11

Court has used is, is it fair, because the defendant

12

could reasonably be expected ­­ could reasonably expect

13

to be haled into the court.

14

That's true of purposeful availment cases

15

like McIntyre.

16

And that is, we measure fairness and whether you are

17

getting process that is due to you procedurally by

18

whether this is something that you could expect to

19

happen to you ­­

20
21
22

It's true of intentional tort cases.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's your new test, just

whether you could expect this to happen?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, sir.

No, sir.

I have

23

given you a specific test about where you have to

24

intentionally injure the person, knowing that they will be

25

injured there, and the injury has to arise there.

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And as I've said, the way in intentional

2

tort cases that has to work is that the lower courts

3

recognize that a tort has a wrong and an injury, and the

4

injury is what makes the tort complete and the tort

5

occurs where the victim is.

6

Just take the "shoot the gun" example,

7

right?

8

It doesn't have to be that you shoot the gun, that the

"It's alleged to violate the Fourth Amendment and our

8

And if you were to conclude, Justice Scalia,

9

that this injury doesn't arise here ­­ let me just tell

10

you what the consequences of that are.

11

there are a large number of cases that arise constantly

12

where people lose access to money, where they don't have

14

Security checks or the IRS refunds.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that is

But, Mr. Goldstein, as I

16

understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying

17

there is a distinction between an officer who commits a

18

fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so

19

he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in

20

Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this

21

affidavit.

22

But it is as to money that is located where

23

he is, not where you are, but where he is in Georgia.

24

That's the distinction that I understood him to be

25

drawing.

The money was in an account in Quantico, Virginia that

What difference does it make as a matter of
personal jurisdiction between the following two cases

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because one of the elements

injury, which isn't an element of the actual underlying

24

freezing a bank account in Nevada.

25

Maybe that can be said to be something that

Alderson Reporting Company

occurs in Nevada ­­ that's reaching into Nevada to cause

2

a real effect in Nevada, to cause something to happen in

knowing and failing to return it, knowing that the

5

failure to return it is going to have an impact wherever
