JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If there is no private

the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad

There's no question under ­­ as this Court

government explains, of course a court is going to be

2

required to ascertain what those parallel requirements

3

are, and whether they were or

4

weren’t complied with.

But this is a case involving a different

5

statute.

irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any

7

particular, is consistent with a regulation that

implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and

under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear

10

from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

Justice Kennedy's question,

13

I think, was different.

14

you are required to use this label and only this label,

15

then you would acknowledge that there is an

impossibility issue; is that right?

which of two opposite­facing canons of construction to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why isn't there a different

4

kind of conflict here?

5

which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has

6

considered and has specifically permitted.

7

through this very long and involved process, and they

8

decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for

9

this kind of product and what were not permitted,

Let's just focus on the name,

They went

10

because they constituted misbranding.

11

the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding,

12

nothing else counts as misbranding.

13

coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the

14

FDA is wrong.

15

isn't that a problem?

This is misbranding.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That seems ­­ why

Why isn't that a problem?

That the FDA said

19

That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA

20

says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

So we know that that is not, in

that because just by examining the FDA's own limited

8

that, you would have some claims about different parts

9

of the label.

But I'm only asking about your

10

claiming as ­­ your claim as to the specific thing that

11

the FDA ruled on.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

And the question is

13

whether Congress gave any indication and it would have

14

to, in this context where the Lanham Act is an express

15

statutory enactment that Congress was well aware of when

16

it enacted the Nutrition Labeling Act and, in fact, was

17

told, not just by the industry, but by

18

testimony, that the Lanham Act was being used to police

19

misrepresentations of the character of food products,

20

you would have to conclude that Congress intended to

21

allow the FDA to supply, if you will, the substantive

22

rule of decision under a different statute that uses

23

different words and ­­ and protects a different class of

24

people when ­­ and here again, I think it's an important

25

indicator why Congress didn't mean that.

What the FDA doesn't do, particularly given

toward, well, what kinds of things are going to so

5

mislead consumers that they think there is going to be a

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what I'm saying is

there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice.

15

you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast

16

majority of your potential customers, they are going to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The FDCA does not deal just with health.

Section 341 makes clear that it also and with respect to

11

the labeling requirements at issue here, quote,

Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some

9

MS. SULLIVAN:

I cannot, Justice Ginsburg,

11

line of court of appeals authority, which are the

12

Federal Railroad Safety Act cases.

16

why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way?

17

That's really the ­­ I think the government's position,

18

which is, if you're using the name in combination with

other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject

to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable

21

under the Lanham Act.

How is this better than Wyeth?

12

MS. SULLIVAN:

Two important distinctions,

13

Your Honor, but let me first disagree with the premise.

14

It's true that FDA doesn't pre­approve the label, but

15

they couldn't have gotten closer here, Justice Kennedy,

requirement, but these regulations are very specific.

provision.

one thing if the FDA decides to adapt its rulemaking.

Suppose Justice Ginsberg's consumers or competitors

showed up and said, Excuse me, we don't think

11

ras­cranberry is clear enough.

12

wasn't.

13

Justice Kennedy said it

Please change your rulemaking.

When the FDA issues guidance or changes its

14

rules or issues a new kind of interpretation, that's one

agency speaking nationally.

What Mr. Waxman wants to do

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan,

I would like you to

21

respond to this question:

In the real world, the FDA

22

has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and

23

labels for juices are not really high on its list.

24

has very limited resources.

25

what it has said about juice as blessing this label,

It

You are asking us to take

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't

2

reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of

3

action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act.

4

It's ­­ it's really very hard to conceive that Congress

5

would have done that.

6

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Ginsburg, precisely

7

for the reasons you say, you should affirm here and go

8

with us in precluding the Lanham Act claims.

9

reason is that Congress has authorized a very specific

regulatory regime here.

clear ­­ that's why they gave specific regulations.

13

14

16

warning letters, which, as the amicus brief of

Mr. Friedman points out, are very effective.

18

Of course you don't want the

It can issue

But the point is that it

19

is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police

21

of Justice Ginsburg's question.

22

And this is relevant because we want to see what the

23

likely intention of Congress was with reference to these

24

two statutes.

25

MS. SULLIVAN:

I think that was the thrust
I had the same concern.

Justice Kennedy, the U.S.

3

What we would respectfully suggest you look at is not

FDA's latest amicus brief through the U.S., but FDA's

5

authoritative statement about whether its labeling

6

regulations were being implemented.

And the

7

In the red brief at Page 7, we cite to the

see FDA in its authoritative statement, irrespective of

14

its amicus brief here, found that 343(f), the

this juice naming regulation that they said, in the

exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are

23

not going to go after you for complying with this naming

convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And yet,

take it that

Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a

12

as at least ­­ not thinking about competitors' welfare or

13

lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer

understanding of labels.

So if that's the case, is the determination

under the Lanham Act different from the determination

17

under the FDCA?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Very definitely, and for ­­ for

some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the

20

Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue

under the Lanham Act and who's protected.

noted that, of course, consumer confusion itself can be

But the former is not what the Lanham Act is

25

about, and the latter, the FDA has made perfectly clear

is not what the FDCA is about.
And interestingly, even with respect to this

3

naming provision, and, you know, we ­­ the government

4

agrees with us far more than it disagrees with us, but

5

our disagreement about the preclusive effect of their
