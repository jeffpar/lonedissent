CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Federal Election Commission.

6

Ms. Murphy.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN E. MURPHY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MS. MURPHY:

10

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

BCRA's aggregate contribution limits are an

12

impermissible attempt to equalize the relative ability

13

of individuals to participate in the political process.

14

By prohibiting contributions that are within the modest

15

base limits Congress has already imposed to combat the

16

reality or appearance of corruption, these limits simply

17

seek to prevent individuals from engaging in too much

18

First Amendment activity.

19

These limits cannot be justified on

20

circumvention grounds because the concerns the

21

Government hypothesizes are already addressed by BCRA's

22

multitude of more direct anti­circumvention measures.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MS. MURPHY:

25

How is that?
Because BCRA imposes numerous

direct circumvention measures.

For instance, we have

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

earmarking provisions on earmarking contributions for a

2

particular candidate.

3

coordinated expenditures with a candidate.

4

proliferation restrictions on creating multiple PACs

5

that are all designed ­­

6

We have coordination restrictions on

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are

Now, all these were there

7

at ­­ but for one ­­ were there at the time of

8

Buckley vs. Valeo, and I guess the Court thought

9

something could happen like the following:

Candidate

10

Smith, we can only give him $2,600, but he has a lot of

11

supporters.

And each of them ­­ 40 of them gets a

12

brainstorm.

And each of the 40 puts on the internet a

13

little sign that says, "Sam Smith PAC.

14

to people like Sam Smith.

15

This money goes

Great people."

Now, we can give each of those 40 $5,000.

16

They aren't coordinated.

They're not established by a

17

single person.

18

pretty well that that total of $5,000 times 40 will go

19

to Sam Smith.

Each is independently run.

20

Okay?

21

MS. MURPHY:

And we know

What does that violate.
Well, there's a couple problems

22

with that hypothetical, Your Honor.

23

are base limits both on what can be given to a PAC ­­

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MS. MURPHY:

First of all, there

$5,000 is ­­
­­ and on what a PAC can give

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to a candidate.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

$5,000.

So we all have is

3

my $5,000 going to the PAC, and there happened to be 400

4

PACs.

5

times 400, how much is that?

So 5,000 times ­­ 4,000.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. MURPHY:

Five times 40, five

I'm not too good at math.

Without doing the math, I will

8

tell you that earmarking and proliferation

9

restrictions ­­

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

There is no

earmarking.

12

MS. MURPHY:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­ but there's ­­
Because earmarking requires

14

that you write on a check or in an accompanying letter

15

that you want the money to go to something.

16

MS. MURPHY:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MS. MURPHY:

But actually, it does not.
It does not?
Earmarking ­­ the FEC's

19

earmarking regulations are broader than that.

20

have a PAC that is going to contribute only to one

21

candidate, you're not ­­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

They'll contribute

23

to several because they'll get more than one

24

contribution.

25

MS. MURPHY:

If you

And at that point, then you

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't have the kind of traceability you're talking about

2

because there is more money coming into the PAC than can

3

find its way to any one particular candidate.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would think, if you named

5

the PAC after a particular candidate, as the

6

hypothetical assumes, I would be surprised if the

7

Federal Election Commission wouldn't come after you for

8

earmarking.

9
10
11

MS. MURPHY:

That's ­­ that's exactly my

point.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, let's say this one,

12

Ms. Murphy ­­ let's say this one, you have 100 PACs, and

13

each of them say that they're going to support the five

14

contest ­­ the five candidates in the most contested

15

Senate races.

16

Senate races, and 100 PACs say that they're going to

17

support those five candidates.

There are really only five very contested

18

So a donor gives $5,000 to each of those 100

19

PACs, which support those candidates, the PAC divides up

20

the money, $1,000 goes to each candidate.

21

all those PACs, $100,000 goes to each of the ­­ of the

22

Senate candidates in the five most contested races, 20

23

times what the individual contribution limits allow.

24
25

MS. MURPHY:
Your Honor.

The total ­­

A couple of responses to that,

I mean, first of all, we're talking about

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scenarios where there isn't coordination at all between

2

the first person who makes the contribution and the

3

candidate, later on, that's receiving it.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

his $100,000 donors.

6

them.

7

Rolodex.

8
9

So ­­

This candidate knows all of
There are not all that many of

He can keep them all in his head in a mental

MS. MURPHY:

But they're not actually donors

to him at that point.

They're contributing to a PAC

10

that, in your hypothetical, is contributing to multiple

11

different candidates and ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Five of the most contested

13

Senate races.

14

five candidates who, if they win, become the five

15

senators that are most attuned to donors.

16

who's given him $100,000, each of those five senators

17

who gets in on the strength of these contributions that

18

are 20 times what the individual limits allow.

19

So a person gives $100,000 to each of

MS. MURPHY:

And he knows

I don't think it works to think

20

of these as direct contributions in excess of the base

21

limits because the PAC is limited itself in how much it

22

can contribute, so you would have to have ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All we're trying to do ­­

24

because it's hard to do in oral argument.

25

we're trying to do in both, I think, our cases is that

7
Alderson Reporting Company

But what

Official

1

we looked up all the rules and the regs ­­ or my law

2

clerk did ­­ and ­­ and what she discovered ­­ and it

3

may be wrong because I'll look at it again ­­ is there

4

has been no significant change in the earmarking rules,

5

in any of the rules that you're talking about, but for

6

one change since Buckley.

7

The one change ­­ the one change is the

8

change that all contributions made by political

9

committees established by or financed or maintained or

10

controlled by a single person will count as one.

11

So what you're seeing in these hypotheticals

12

is, simply, the construction of precisely the same

13

situation that existed in Buckley while being careful to

14

have not one person control the 4,000 PACs, which is

15

pretty easy to do.

16

And if you want to say, is this a reality?

17

Turn on your television set or internet because we found

18

instances, without naming names, where it certainly is a

19

reality.

20

MS. MURPHY:

Two responses.

There are

21

changes in earmarking, more than what you've suggested

22

because the restrictions that the FEC has put out in

23

regulations are ­­ are ­­ they cover more than the

24

statute itself.

25

And specifically, they cover these instances

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a PAC that is only going to be contributing to one

2

candidate, which is where a lot of the concern comes

3

from.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just want to be clear

5

what your answer to Justice Kagan was, her hypothetical.

6

Is ­­ is part of your answer that this might ­­ the

7

hypothetical that she gives ­­ contravene earmarking?

8

Or ­­

9

MS. MURPHY:

That's part ­­ it can pose both

10

earmarking concerns and proliferation concerns, if we're

11

talking about something.

12

PAC that's ­­

13

And if we're talking about a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So is part of your answer

14

to her there that the hypothetical isn't real or isn't

15

going to happen or ­­

16

MS. MURPHY:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

the existing law?

19

MS. MURPHY:

Yes, I think ­­
­­ or can't happen under

Is that your answer?
That's part of the answer.

I

20

don't think it's a particularly realistic scenario under

21

existing regulations.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is this ­­ is this ­­

would the other side concede that this is true?
MS. MURPHY:
that it's true.

I ­­ I doubt they would concede
But ­­ you know, I think that if you

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at it, if you have a bunch of PACs that are getting

2

contributions from this same group of individuals, you

3

are going to run into earmarking and proliferation

4

restrictions.

But the other thing I would say ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry.

You ­­

I can't imagine that if you

7

have a PAC which says we're going to give money to

8

Smith, that's bad, but if you have a PAC that says we're

9

going to give all the money that you contribute to us to

10

Smith and Jones, that's okay ­­ or Smith, Jones, and

11

three others.

12
13
14

It seems to me that that's earmarking.

MS. MURPHY:

Exactly.

If the earmarking

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Murphy, if you think

15

it's earmarking to have a PAC that gives money to the

16

five most ­­ the candidates in the five most contested

17

Senate races, I just don't think any FEC would say that

18

that's earmarking.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I may have an overly

20

suspicious mind, but I don't know.

21

rise up and all of them said exactly the same thing,

22

we're going to make contributions to the five most

23

contested Senate ­­ the candidates in the five most

24

contested Senate races, I would be suspicious.

25

If I saw 100 PACs

And maybe the FEC would also be suspicious

10

4

that they didn't just all spring up independently.
MS. MURPHY:
right.

I think that's absolutely

I think the FEC would be suspicious, but ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose ­­ suppose a

5

number of PACs ­­ I forget the number in Justice Kagan's

6

example ­­ said, we're going to give to congressional

7

and senatorial candidates who ­­ who want to cut down on

8

governmental spending, and we know there's only about

9

four people that are like that.

10

MS. MURPHY:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MS. MURPHY:

Well ­­

I mean, at that point, I

13

think ­­ you know, that ­­ that when you have a PAC

14

that's not saying to any certainty what they're going to

15

do, then you ­­ you don't ­­ it's not clear you have

16

something to target there, because the PAC might be

17

spending money in different ways that are not operating

18

as a conduit to ­­ for circumvention.

19

So ­­ you know, I think that gets, again, to

20

why this doesn't have the kind of coordination you need.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Murphy ­­
Ms. Murphy, can I give you

23

another one?

24

completely safe seats, all right?

25

maybe ­­ you know, 30 or 40 or something like that in

There are 150 House candidates with

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And there are

Official

their party who don't have safe seats.

2

together, and they say, we're going to run a joint

3

fundraiser, and anybody can contribute $2,600 to each of

4

these candidates, 150 of them, right?

5

about $400,000.

6

So the 150 get

So that makes

And then these 150 candidates with

7

completely safe seats just transfer all this money to

8

the one person who doesn't have a safe seat, so that's

9

about $400,000.

Double it for a primary and a general

10

election, that's about $800,000 that all goes to one

11

candidate from one donor because of the ability for

12

candidates to transfer money to each other.

A candidate can transfer a

maximum of $2,600 to another candidate per election.

19

to a candidate per election, and that's a

contribution ­­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I stand corrected on the

basis of $600.
MS. MURPHY:

That's a hard contribution

25

think all of this also gets to another problem, which is

12
Alderson Reporting Company

But ­­ but I

Official

1

there's an overbreadth problem here, because if ­­ if

2

you're talking about this scenario, in your scenario,

3

there's only one person who can even make a contribution

at that point after the first $2,600 is received ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You're exactly right.

You're exactly right, Ms. Murphy.

9

do is they can do it for every single other candidate in

contested district.

14

So take your 30 or 40 House contested

MS. MURPHY:

I mean, I think, even if you

15

accept this scenario where all of these candidates are

16

independently deciding to give all their money to one

candidate, you can't have a law that is designed to

prevent this one person from circumvention by

of the aggregate limits is to limit someone's

contributions to other candidates or state parties who

to make a record, and it chose to treat this as a legal

case, not as one in which ­­

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10

If a person contributes to a PAC with

JUSTICE SCALIA:

­­ well, ordinarily, the

national political parties will devote their money to

9

chance of losing.

So, in fact, if you're an incumbent

who cares about political parties, I don't want money to

11

go to my opponents.

12

And if you ­­ if you turn down the amount of

that's that much less money that can be devoted

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Burchfield, if you take

4

off the aggregate limits, people will be allowed, if you

5

put together the national committees and all the State

6

committees and all the candidates in the House and the

7

Senate, it comes to over $3.5 million.

8
9

So I can write checks totaling $3.5 million
to the Republican Party committees and all its

10

candidates or to the Democratic Party committees and all

11

its committees, even before I start writing checks to

12

independent PACs.

13

Now, having written a check to ­­ for 3.5 or

14

so million dollars to a single party's candidates, are

15

you suggesting that that party and the members of that

16

party are not going to owe me anything, that I won't get

17

any special treatment?

18

Because I thought that that was exactly what

19

we said in McConnell, that, when we talked about soft

20

money restrictions, we understood that you give

21

$3.5 million, you get a very, very special place at the

22

table.

soft money scheme of McConnell, isn't it?

25

So this is effectively to ­­ to reintroduce the

The soft money, by definition, was not

To take your example of the joint

fundraising committee, the joint fundraising regulation,

6

which consumes more than three pages in the ­­ in the

7

Federal Code of Federal Regulations ­­ it's at

102.17(c) ­­ it specifically reaffirms the base limits.

9

It specifically reaffirms the anti­earmarking

10

restriction, and it says that the joint fundraising

11

committee must inform all contributors of those

12

restrictions.

13

So, again, it's a situation where the

14

money leaves the contributor's hands, he loses control

15

over it, and the person who receives it makes the

16

direction.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the money ­­ but the

19

this even worse.

Well, we know from the

Citizens United decision, Your Honor, that gratitude and

9

That is not the sort of corruption that

would sustain this limit, especially in light of the

severe restrictions on speech and association that it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Aggregate limits combat corruption.
start by explaining exactly how.

Let me

Aggregate limits

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of

2

individual contribution limits and, equally,

3

fundamentally, by serving as a bulwark against a

4

campaign finance system dominated by massive individual

5

contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo

6

corruption would be obvious and inherent and the

7

corrosive appearance of corruption would be

8

overwhelming.

9

Now, the Appellants in this case have tried

10

to present the case as though the issue were whether

11

there were some corrupting potential in giving

12

contribution to the nineteenth candidate after someone

13

has already contributed to ­­ the maximum to the

14

eighteenth.

15

But that is not what this case is about.

The Appellants are not arguing that the

16

aggregate limit is drawn in the wrong place.

17

arguing that there can be no aggregate limit because the

18

base contribution limits do all the work.

19

that means is that you ­­ you're taking the lid off the

20

aggregate contribution limit, and as Justice Kagan and

21

her question earlier indicated, that means that an

22

individual can contribute, every two years, up to

23

$3.6 million to candidates for a party, party national

24

committees and state committees ­­

24

It's a problem analogous to the one that was at

29

2

the very fact of delivering that check creates the

3

inherent opportunity for quid pro quo corruption,

4

exactly the kind of risk that the Court identified in

5

Buckley, wholly apart from where that money goes after

6

it's delivered.

7

But the delivery of it ­­

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

What ­­ what is the

framework ­­ what is the framework for analyzing?

I

10

agree with you on the aggregation, but it has this

11

consequence with respect to limiting how many candidates

12

an individual can support within the limits that

13

Congress has said don't present any danger of

14

corruption.

15

So what is the framework for analyzing that?

16

Give you your argument with respect to the transfers and

17

the appearance there, but it does have that other

18

consequence on something we've recognized as a

19

significant right.

20

So ­­

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Let me make a specific

21

point about that and then work into the framework.

22

specific point is this:

23

would have the effect of restricting the ability of a

24

contributor to make the maximum contribution to more

25

than a certain number of candidates.

The

The ­­ the aggregate limit

30
Alderson Reporting Company

That's true.

We

Official

1
2

can't help but acknowledge that.

It's math.

But that doesn't mean that that individual

3

cannot spend as much as the individual wants on

4

independent expenditures to try to advance the interest

5

of those candidates or the interests of the causes that

6

those candidates stand for.

7

Mr. McCutcheon, for example, can spend as

8

much of his considerable fortune as he wants on

9

independent expenditure advocating the election of these

10
11

candidates.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that does not ­­ that

12

does not evoke any gratitude on the part of the people?

13

I mean, if gratitude is ­­ is corruption ­­ you know,

14

don't those independent expenditures evoke gratitude?

15

And is ­­ is not the evil of big money ­­ 3.2 million,

16

17

spend it, right?

It's not that we're

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I do think we have

12

limits on contributions to political parties, in

13

addition to limits on contributions to candidates.

14

I think that does help establish the point here, which

15

is that candidates are not hermetically sealed off from

16

each other, and parties are not hermetically sealed off

17

from candidates.

18

And

They ­­ you know, they're all on the same

GENERAL VERRILLI:

How realistic is it that all of the state party

are two ­­ Justice Alito, I think that, with all due

16

respect, I think the point Your Honor is making confuses

17

two different ways in which these laws combat the risk

18

of corruption.

19

The first one is that the ­­ the handing

20

over of the large check and whether it's a $3.6 million

21

check for everyone or a $2.2 million check for the House

22

candidates or a $1 million check for all the state

committees, the very ­­ just as the Court found in

2

there, there's an inherent risk of corruption.
And that's why, indeed, as I said, we have

3

limits on how much we can contribute to a political

4

party for that reason ­­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't understand

that ­­
GENERAL VERRILLI:

how it gets transferred.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Unless the money is

transferred to ­­ you have to get it from the person who

wants to corrupt to the person who is going to be

corrupted.

13

B, I don't see where the quid pro quo argument is.

14

And unless the money can make it from A to

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think that the ­­

15

I think that the way these joint fundraising committees

16

work is you hand over a single check to a candidate who

17

solicits it.

Now, it could be any candidate who sets up

to that candidate is a ­­ seems to me ­­ you know,

22

creates a significant risk of indebtedness on the part

23

of that candidate, even though a lot of the money is

24

flowing through to others.

25

In addition, the party leaders are often

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to be the ones who solicit those contributions,

2

and they're going to be ­­ have a particular

3

indebtedness to candidates because, of course, their

4

power, their authority depends on the party retaining

5

or ­­ or gaining a majority in the legislature.

6

And so they're going to feel a particular

7

sense of indebtedness, that this person is helping, not

8

only them, but everybody ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand ­­

GENERAL VERRILLI:

­­ in these massive

11

amounts and then ­­ I'm sorry, if I may just make my

12

third point, Mr. Chief Justice?

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Sure.
And then the third point

15

I think is that every ­­ every candidate in the party is

16

going to be affected by this because every candidate is

17

going to get a slice of the money, and every candidate

18

is going to know that this person who wrote the

19

multimillion dollar check has helped, not only the

20

candidate, but the whole team, and that creates a

21

particular sense of indebtedness.

22

And, of course, every member of the party is

23

likely to ­­ every ­­ every officeholder in the party is

24

likely to be leaned on by the party leadership to

JUSTICE ALITO:

These ­­ these aggregate

3

limits might not all stand or fall together.

4

just take this example, if you can just take a minute

5

and walk me through this step­by­step.

6

Let ­­

You have somebody who wants to corrupt a

7

member of the House, and this person's strategy is to

8

make contributions to multiple House candidates with the

9

hope, the expectation, the plan that those candidates

10

are going to transfer ­­ transfer the money to the ­­

11

the member that this person wants to corrupt.

12

Now, how is that person going to accomplish

13

that, given the earmarking regulations, and ­­ and the

14

limits on how much one member can contribute to another?

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So ­­ you know, I think

16

that that ­­ I think it's possible, but I think, if

17

somebody had that goal, that circumvention goal, but by

far better ways of achieving it would be giving

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so ­­

Well, if you're ­­ I mean,

12

the contribution to A, that person wants it to go to B,

14

If the person even implies, when making

So how is this going to be done?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think ­­ well,

15

I ­­ in McConnell and in Colorado Republican to this

Court said that earmarking is not the outer limit of the

17

government's authority to regulate here.

18

the Court said that is because a lot of this can be done

19

with winks and nods and subtly.

20

don't think it's the case that earmarking would work to

21

prohibit that.

And the reason

And so I ­­ and so I

GENERAL VERRILLI:

4

current state of the record.

5

Honor's point.

6

I understand and take Your

But I do think that you had a substantial

record in Buckley, you had a substantial record in

the question of whether massive aggregate contributions

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the ­­ the

So apparently, that's not too much of a

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, Justice Scalia, I'm

16

not here to debate the question of whether the Court's

17

jurisprudence is correct with respect to the risks of

18

corruption from independent expenditures.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It is what it is, though.
But we accept it and ­­

21

and the line is that there ­­ in this Court's

22

jurisprudence, that there is an unacceptable risk when

23

contributions are too high.

24

in conclusion ­­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if I may just say this

Okay.

53

to the questions that have been put previously from ­­

from me and Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia is that's

the law?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress isn't ­­
­­ with the understanding

10

that your answer is Buckley has settled that issue; no

11

more discussion necessary?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The ­­ the risk ­­ we ­­

13

we think the risk of corruption is real.

14

it's, in fact, profound when you are talking about the

15

kinds of contributions that can be made if you take ­­

16

if you take the lid off on aggregate contributions.

17

And we think

If it ­­ if Justice Scalia's critique of the

18

situation proves correct and it is deeply disabling to

19

candidates and parties, Congress can address that by

20

changing the contribution limits.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And ­­

And, General, I suppose

22

that, if this Court is having second thoughts about its

23

rulings that independent expenditures are not

24

corrupting, we could change that part of the law.

25

(Laughter.)

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And far be it from me to

suggest that you don't, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if it's interrelated.

4

But the ­­ the record, as far as I recall it from

5

several years ago, talked about at length, I don't like

6

to use the word "corrupting"; I like to use

7

integration ­­ "integrity of the process," that notion

8

to get people to think that their First Amendment

9

speech makes a difference, etcetera.

10

Let's say "corruption."

Mostly when it got

11

to this part, the aggregate, it was about circumvention.

12

And I think you are quite right to say, but there is a

13

huge corruption aspect to this.

14

But we don't have a lot of information in

15

the record about that, do we?

16

miss it?

17

Did I miss something?

If I just ­­ did I just

Yeah.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is a close parallel when

23

I think about it, maybe ­­ or you think about it, but if

24

you're really talking ­­ they don't think about it that

25

way.

And so that's why I've been pushing this idea, you

I understand that, Your

And, therefore, I think it bears upon it,

and it's ­­ it's ample evidence that would justify

upholding these aggregate limits, and I would strongly

urge the Court to do so.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN E. MURPHY
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MS. MURPHY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few quick points.
First, we haven't heard the Solicitor

24

General talk that much about circumvention today, and I

25

think that's because the circumvention argument just

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

doesn't really work.
It's already addressed by all of the

3

multiple prophylactic measures that BCRA contains.

4

to the extent those aren't sufficient, there are much

5

narrower, tailored ways to get at this, as the questions

6

from Justice Alito and the Chief Justice pointed out.

7

And

What we're really hearing today is a

8

corruption argument.

9

once you accept the corruption theory that the

But as the questioning revealed,

10

Government is putting forward here, there really isn't a

11

way to continue to draw a line between independent

12

expenditures and the three­point million dollar check to all of

13

these different individuals that is in small based

14

limited amounts because there's certainly going to be

15

just as much gratitude to the individual who spends

16

$3.6 million directly supporting one candidate through

17

ads on that candidate's behalf.

18

So what we really have is a system that's

19

forcing money out of the most transparent way possible

20

to make contributions which is directly to the

21

candidates and the parties and the PACs.

22

If there's no further questions, thank you.

23
