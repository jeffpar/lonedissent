Parke v. Troice in the consolidated cases.

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Stanford Ponzi scheme was a massive

12

fraud, but that fraud clearly included material

13

misrepresentations about transactions in covered

14

securities.

The complaints in this case bear that out.

15

Plaintiffs allege specifically that their

16

money was ­­ there were misrepresentations about how

17

their money would be invested in covered securities,

18

that the misrepresentation was material, and that,

19

indeed, the security of the underlying investments was

20

the most important factor in securing Plaintiff's own

21

investments in the CDs.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

, I ­­ I think there's

23

some problem with whether or not this was covered

24

securities, but I also think that's not in the case

25

anymore.

Am I correct in the latter assumption?

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I certainly agree with

2

you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both

3

lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint

4

specifically ­­ referred to covered securities

5

specifically enough.

6

I don't want to belabor the point because I

7

don't think it's in the case, but I will say I do think

8

there's a reason that that was not a contested issue

9

because, if you think about the securities that were

10

referred to, strong multinational corporations, major

11

international banks, those are companies that are traded

12

on U.S. national exchanges.

13

Also, if you get into the details of the

14

record, I mean,

15

something, Joint Appendix page 746 is an attachment to

16

the Willis complaint.

17

the New York Stock Exchange, and it's a translated

18

letter to investors, and you can read it more than one

19

way.

20

if you want to look at

And there, there's a reference to

But I sure think the whole point of that

21

paragraph is to lead the Plaintiffs to think that their

22

stocks ­­ they're buying an interest in stocks that would

23

be traded on the New York Stock Exchange particularly.

24

So ­­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if ­­ if I'm

trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets

2

you have and I list a couple of stocks, and, in fact,

3

it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered

4

transaction, that's a 10b­5 violation?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief

6

Justice.

7

that I don't think the Court has to decide in this case,

8

which is whether a reference to your stockholdings would

9

be sufficient to ­­ to come with ­­

10

That would depend on the answer to a question

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose you say you're

11

going to pay off the loan by selling some stock

12

holdings, eventually.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, I think that probably

14

would be covered, Your Honor, and I don't think that's

15

any great surprise.

16

called Reuben against the United States that, if you

17

pledge securities that are ­­ and tell the bank that

18

they're valuable and they, in fact, aren't, that that's

19

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's right.

I'm just

3

saying, though, that I don't think the fact that you can

4

have a misrepresentation in connection with a loan

5

application or something like that is all that

6

surprising in the sense that the way that both 10b,

7

10b­5, and SLUSA are structured.

8
9

The "in connection with" requirement can
take something that might otherwise be plain fraud, and

10

if there's a misrepresentation in connection with a

11

security or a covered security, that makes it securities

12

fraud.

cases where whether you can prosecute a fraud or

13

You can go at it either way.

3

After all, it's beneficial, sometimes, for
What are the cases?

MR. CLEMENT:

Your Honor, I don't know that

4

there are cases directly on point.

5

Our theory here does not, by any means, necessarily have

6

to extend to those holder situations.

7

here is not just a misrepresentation about holdings of

8

securities.

9

covered securities transactions.

10

But let me be clear.

What is at issue

It is ­­ they are misrepresentations about

And more particularly, they are false

11

promises to purchase covered securities for Plaintiffs'

12

benefit.

13

those circumstances and, as well, there should be

14

because, when you sell something, whether it's a

15

noncovered security or something else based on a

16

misrepresentation about covered securities, you trigger

17

the interests of the SEC and SLUSA in a distinct way.

18

And there are SEC cases that are brought under

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose two people reach a

19

prenuptial agreement, and as part of the prenuptial

20

agreement, they agree that, in a year, one party to the

21

marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock

22

and buy a home with it.

23

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that covered by the

I would think probably not, at

the end of the day, but I also would say that this is so

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

far removed from that.

2

I mean, first of all ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is it removed from

3

that?

4

which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're

5

going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not

6

affect any securities trading.

7

decision to do something else, here, to buy CDs or, in

8

my example, to go get married.

9

Because it has the same structural features,

MR. CLEMENT:

What it affects is a

With respect, Your Honor, I

10

think this Court has already crossed the bridge that you

11

don't have to effect the specific transaction in which

12

you are ­­ the fraud is alleged to be associated with.

13

So you have cases like O'Hagan, for example, where the

14

actual transaction on the ­­ on the exchange is not

15

sullied with the fraud and the victim of the fraud

16

doesn't even trade, the holder of the confidential

17

information ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In all of our cases, there's

19

been something to say when somebody can ask the

20

question, how has this affected a potential purchaser or

21

seller in the market for the relevant securities?

22

here, there's nothing to say.

MR. CLEMENT:
the premise.

And

With respect, I disagree with

I don't think ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Somebody, not necessarily

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had

2

some transaction in the market.

3

misrepresentation that would affect someone in making

4

transactions in the covered market.

5

that?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

It's the kind of

How would this do

Well, the only way in which

7

there isn't that kind of transaction here is because the

8

fraud was bigger.

9

imagine that this was a thing where they said, look,

As we point out in the briefs, if you

10

we're going to purchase multinational corporations; and,

11

instead, they purchase domestic corporations.

12

Well, then, there would be a transaction

13

that would not have otherwise occurred on the market and

14

domestic transactions that would have been perfectly

15

analogous to the kind of normal transaction that took

16

place in Bankers Life or in Zandford on the market.

17

And yet, the fraud was sufficiently associated with this.

18

And I don't think this Court wants to say

19

that the only frauds that are not in connection with are

20

the really big ones ­­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what is the case?

22

What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes

23

the closest ­­ I grant you there is none direct ­­ but

25

7

case ­­ but they may be better at answering this.

8

is their closest case to the horribles that they foresee

9

if you lose?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

What

Well, I ­­ I think, probably,

11

I would start with the Richard Line case, which is cited

12

on page 21 of their brief.

13

that you can have frauds in connection with covered

14

securities that affect things that are either not

15

covered securities or, in that case, are nothing at all.

16

And what that case shows is

Mr. Line was very clever.

He took people

17

who were interested in having their kids go to college

18

and needed financial aid, and he said, I'll take your

19

assets from you, and they'll be ­­ they'll be mine, I'm

20

not going to give you anything in return, not a covered

21

security, nothing, because the whole point of this is to

22

get your assets off your books.

23

And what I'll do is I'll invest those in the

24

market, make a bunch of money, and in four years, when

25

you're no longer worried about financial aid, I'll

12
Alderson Reporting Company

2

return your principal and some of the proceeds.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And ­­

Well, in Justice ­­ Justice

3

Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems

4

that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in

5

question are securities or some other asset.

6

also ­­ and, therefore, a fortiori, it's irrelevant

7

whether ­­ if it involves securities, whether they're

8

covered or they're not covered.

9

And it's

Now, would you be willing to concede that,

10

in that situation, where it really ­­ all you're talking

11

about is an asset.

12

covered security or a ­­ a Rembrandt or gold, that, in

13

that situation, 10(b) doesn't reach the case?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

It doesn't matter whether it's a

I think that ­­ I would agree

15

with that, Justice Alito, but for a slightly different

16

reason than you may be imagining, which is I think one

17

of the mistakes that can be made here is to ask in

18

connection with ­­

19

has multiple requirements, including a materiality

20

requirement.

21

do all the work.

And the statute

And as your question suggests, if you're

22

making a misrepresentation and the whole point of it is

23

to just tell somebody that, look, I have wealth, or I

24

have sort of assets, I don't know that the specific

25

nature of them makes any difference.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But in a case like this, the whole point of

2

this fraud was to take a noncovered security and to

3

imbue it with some of the positive qualities of a

4

covered security, the most important of which being

5

liquidity.

6

brochures here that were used to market this, that's

7

really what this fraud was all about.

8
9
10
11

And if you look at sort of the underlying

These ­­­ these CDs were offered as being
better than normal CDs because we can get you your money
whenever you need it.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Does it matter that there ­­

12

apparently, there is not an allegation that there

13

actually were any purchases or sales of covered

14

securities?

15

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

16

security."

17

It says in ­­ the statute says, "in

And there weren't.

There ­­ I don't believe there's an

18

allegation that they actually were purchased or sold.

19

Does that matter?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

It doesn't matter, Your Honor,

21

for the reason I indicated earlier, which is you don't

22

want to draw a line that basically says, look, if you

23

buy different securities than you were supposed to or

24

you sell fewer than you were supposed to, that's

25

covered, but if you're a Madoff, and you go all the way

14
Alderson Reporting Company

and simply lie about the whole thing and there never

2

were any securities purchases at all, that that's

3

somehow better.

4
5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's your best case on

that?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think, again, if ­­ if

7

you want to start with SEC adjudications, again, on page

8

21, there is the Jett adjudication where, again, there

9

was a broker/dealer in that case, and they just made up

10

the trades.

11

how I've done, look at these great trades.

12

just weren't any trades.

13

They told their employer, you know, look
And there

And of course, all of the Madoff cases ­­ or

14

a substantial number of Madoff cases fit that ­­ fit

15

that ­­ that categorization.

16

whether this case does because, at the end of the day, I

17

think what's alleged is either there were no purchases

18

or substantially less purchases of covered securities

19

than represented.

20

It's actually not clear

Nobody has really thought the difference

21

between zero and substantially less made much of a

22

difference in this case.

23

said, suggest that that's the right result because,

24

whatever else is true, you can't somehow have a better

25

fraud that's immune from the SEC, just because you

And I would certainly, like I

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

completely made the whole thing up and there were no

2

transactions at all.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. ­­ Mr. Clement, there

4

are ­­ Zandford said that "in connection with" doesn't

5

include every common law fraud that happens to involve

6

covered securities.

7

what would not be covered?

8

securities would not qualify as in connection with the

9

sale or purchase of securities?

10

So can you give us an example of

MR. CLEMENT:

What fraud involving

Sure.

Let me start with ­­ I

11

mean ­­ with a hypothetical that Zandford used because I

12

think it helps illustrate why, even if coincide is the

13

test, we satisfied here.

14

distinguishing is two cases, one where a broker/dealer

15

gets money from a potential client with the purest of

16

intentions and only at a later stage do they say ­­ you

17

know, I'm kind of below on own payments, I need some

18

money, I'm going to embezzle the funds.

19

What Zandford was really

And Zandford said, in that context, the

20

fraud and the security purchases are independent events.

21

I don't think anybody would look at this case and say

22

that the misrepresentations about covered securities

23

purchases and the fraud were independent events, nor

24

would anybody say that this isn't a case where, from the

25

very beginning, there was intent by Stanford not to make

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

good on the promise to purchase covered securities on

2

behalf of the plaintiffs.

3

So this is like Zandford itself or Wharf ­­

4

Wharf Holdings itself, where the fraudulent intent is

5

there at the very moment the transaction takes place.

6

And, again, Wharf Holdings is another example where this

7

Court says, in dictum, that, well ­­ you know, it would

8

be one thing if they sold the option and only, later,

9

independently decided that they weren't going to perform

10
11
12
13

on the option.
But if they had that intent all along, they
clearly coincide.

Now ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I had assumed that the

14

purpose of the securities laws was to protect the

15

purchasers and sellers of the covered securities.

16

is no purchaser or cover ­­ or seller of a covered

17

security involved here.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There

Well, there ­­
It's ­­ it's a purchaser of

20

not ­­ not­covered securities who is being defrauded, if

21

anyone.

22

protect that person?

23

Why ­­ why would the Federal securities law

MR. CLEMENT:

A couple things, Your Honor.

24

First of all, obviously, the Federal securities laws

25

apply to non­covered securities, as well as covered

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

securities.

2

SLUSA's coverage because, as I said, 10b­5 applies to

3

non­covered securities.

So the real question here is going to be

4

Second of all, this Court is well over the

5

bridge about not requiring that it be the plaintiff's

6

own purchases or sales that are what the inquiry focuses

7

on.

MR. CLEMENT:

The simplest ­­ the simplest,

narrowest way to decide this case is to say that, when

there is a misrepresentation and a false promise to

purchase covered securities for the benefit of the

plaintiffs, then the "in connection with" standard is

required.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG,

11

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13
14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

15

We agree with the narrow formulation that

16

Mr. Clement just gave, that the issue in this case is

17

that it involves a false promise to purchase covered

18

securities using the fraud victims' money in a way that

19

they are told is going to benefit them and that that is

20

a classic securities fraud.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

the word "benefit"?

23

case comes down to.

Their question ­­
So how ­­ how broad is

Because that's really what this

24

MS. GOLDENBERG:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think ­­
Assuming we accepted

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

your narrow test, which wouldn't address every situation

2

that the other circuits have talked about, but let's ­­

3

let's ­­

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think it's clear that

5

"benefit" isn't restricted merely to ownership of the

6

securities themselves, and I would point to ­­

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that was the

Madoff situation, which was different from this one.

9

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I don't think the

10

Madoff situation is particularly different from this

11

one.

12

were buying into that were non­covered securities.

13

In Madoff, there were feeder funds that people

And what they were being told is that the

14

money that was being put into the feeder fund was then

15

going to go on and be used to purchase covered

16

securities that they, themselves, were not going to have

17

an ownership interest in, but that the benefit of those

18

purchases was going to be passed back to them through

19

this intermediate layer.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­ but the ­­ the case

21

that he said ­­ I'm quite interested in your reaction to

22

which cases that you've ever brought, this would, if you

23

lose here, would prevent you from bringing, and Line was

24

the one that was mentioned.

25

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in Line, there is a

2

broker who says to a client, give me some money and I

3

will buy some securities on the exchange for you.

4

they gave him the money, and he didn't.

5

directly related to a promise that is going to effect a

6

purchase or sale of a security directly.

7

someone to buy securities for his account.

And

Well, that's

He's promising

8

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I actually ­­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't think that that's

10
11

this case.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I actually think that

12

the Line case is much more analogous to this case than

13

Your Honor is suggesting because what was happening in

14

Line is the ­­ what the broker said to the victims was,

15

you have children who are going to college, you don't

16

want to have this money around because you want to be

17

able to get financial aid, so give the money to me, and

18

in several years, I will give that money back to you

19

with ­­

20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

He didn't say, I will buy

them for you.

22

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I can understand how a

24

promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a

25

person or a statement that would lead a person to take a

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position.

2

world, it would lead someone in the world to take a

3

position.

Whether it's this plaintiff or someone in the

4

What your opponents say is that is what is

5

present ­­ not present here; neither the person who is

6

giving the money nor anyone else, with the possible

7

exception of the defendant, is being led by this

8

statement to take a position in a market for, buy,

9

against, sell, or even, if you like, not sell or buy,

10
11

hold.

I'll throw that in.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Your Honor, the ­­ just to

12

return to Line for a moment, and then I'd like to

13

address sort of how the purposes of the securities laws

14

are implicated in a situation like this, in Line, what

15

the victims were told was that they were going to be

16

given the money back after four years had passed, with

17

interest calculated above market rate.

18

So they are not being told that they were

19

going to be given whatever profit is made on a

20

securities transaction, or, as I read Line, although

21

it's slightly sparse on its facts, that they're going to

22

be the owners of the securities or have an ownership

23

interest in any way.

24

Line that are at the margin ­­

25

And so I do think it is cases like

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Anyway, Line's not a case

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of ours, is it?

2

MS. GOLDENBERG:

No, it's not, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a case of any

4

court, is it?

5

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It is an SEC ­­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's one of your cases.

7

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

9

We don't have to

agree with all of your cases, do we?

10

(Laughter.)

11

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Certainly not, although we

12

do think that the SEC's expert view in a formal

13

adjudication may warrant some deference.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­

So, Ms. Goldenberg, suppose

15

I think that the correct test is something along the

16

lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is ­­ is this

17

the kind of representation that could affect somebody’s ­­

18

It doesn't have to be the victim of the fraud, it can be

19

somebody else, but that could affect somebody's decision

20

to buy or sell or hold covered securities.

21

Can you satisfy that test?

22

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, I think so because I

23

think that, here, there is a major effect on investor

24

confidence and investor confidence specifically with

25

respect to covered securities in several different ways.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If people see that lies of the kind here,

2

where someone is telling someone else, I'm going to buy

3

covered securities, and it's going to benefit you, are

4

being made and those lies are ­­ are ­­ well, that's a

5

fraud on the victims, then I think people are less

6

likely to go to their broker and say, here's some money,

7

go out on the market, and buy me some securities.

8

It's a ­­ it's a lie that goes to the

9

mechanism by which the securities markets operate, which

10

is the purchases and sales, and it makes it less likely

11

for people to be willing to believe that, when they

12

engage in purchases and sales, that something's really

13

is going to happen, and the person is going to

14

respond ­­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, if you ­­ if

16

you went to church and heard a sermon that there are

17

lots of people that are evil, maybe then you wouldn't

18

invest, but I'm ­­

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, but this is much more

20

particular, again, to the mechanism by which the

21

securities markets operate.

22

look at it is just to imagine the honest version of

23

Stanford.

24
25

And I think another way to

If someone honestly said to CD purchasers,
give me your money, and I'm going to put it into covered

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

securities, and people invested in that scheme, then

2

that would pump money into the covered securities

3

markets.

4
5
6

But now, people are much less likely to
invest in a scheme like that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well ­­ but nobody

7

is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with

8

respect to the noncovered securities.

9

there's diminished confidence in the securities markets,

So to the extent

10

the SEC has all the tools available to address that.

11

The question is the different one under SLUSA.

12

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think it's true

13

that the SEC would continue to have tools, but I do

14

think ­­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, in fact,

16

I ­­ this ­­ it would inspire confidence to the extent

17

that lawyers can bring these actions, as opposed to

18

having them precluded, which is what you're arguing for.

19

I'm sorry I interrupted you.

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well ­­ no, that's fine.

21

think that this is a very particular effect on investor

22

confidence and the integrity of the markets, which is

23

one of the purposes of the securities laws.

24

And with respect to SLUSA, the purpose of

25

SLUSA is to try to stop people from going around the

26
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

requirements of the PSLRA and some of the limitations in

2

this Court's decisions, and I think that purpose is ­­

3

is at issue here as well.

4

I'd also like to talk a little bit, if I

5

could, about the issue that was raised earlier about

6

whether an actual purchase or sale needed to be made, or

7

whether a purported or intended purchase or sale is

8

sufficient.

9

And I think that, practically, from the

10

moment that the '33 and '34 Act went into place, there's

11

been a consensus in the lower courts ­­ and the SEC has

12

said this as well ­­ that a purported or intended

13

purchase or sale is sufficient.

14

And it's for the reason that Mr. Clement

15

gave that, otherwise, you have these home run, egregious

16

frauds, where someone is, instead of saying I'm going to

17

buy this less risky thing and then buying a riskier

18

thing, someone says, I'm going to buy securities, and

19

then doesn't buy them at all and absconds with the

20

money, and that that is something ­­ a situation that

21

has to be ­­ has to be covered.

22
23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I take you back to the

test that you think we should apply here?

24

MS. GOLDENBERG:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Sure.
The test that Mr. Clement

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount

2

to ­­ to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is

3

alleged, that that's ­­ that that's within 10b or 10b­5,

4

that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward.

5

Now, the test that Justice Breyer suggested,

6

whether something would affect investors' confidence in

7

the securities market, I don't know how we can ­­ and

8

you say, yes, this would ­­ that would be met here ­­ I

9

don't know how we can determine what ­­ whether

10

something, certainly, of this nature or maybe even

11

further removed, would, in effect ­­ would affect

12

investor confidence.

13

Somebody might read about this scheme in the

14

paper and say, well ­­ you know, there's a lot of hanky

15

panky going on with the sale of any kind of securities

16

and CDs, I'm just going to keep cash under my mattress.

17

How do we ­­ how would we determine that?

18

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I ­­ I think it's for

19

the reasons that I gave earlier, which is that this goes

20

to the purchase/sale mechanism and that we know that

21

people have to have confidence in that order ­­ in order

22

for the securities markets to work.

23

It may well be that people also ­­ you know,

24

lack confidence in other things, but that is the thing

25

that's the particular problem and the thing that the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

securities laws are aimed at.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I know Petitioner ­­
What ­­ what troubles me,

3

Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring out

4

these economic consequences, but the text of the

5

statute, which says, "in connection with the purchase or

6

sale of one of the covered securities."

7

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There has been no purchase

9
10
11
12

or sale here.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, there's been a

purported purchase.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It can't be in connection

13

with a purchase or sale that has never occurred.

14

mean, it could be have read in connection with the

15

purchase or sale or the promised purchase or sale or the

16

contemplated purchase or sale, but it doesn't.

17

"in connection with the purchase or sale."

18
19
20

I

It says,

I don't know how you can make that stick to
a situation where there has been no purchase or sale.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

That's true, Your Honor,

21

but it also doesn't say the consummated purchase or

22

sale, and so I think the purported, intended,

23

consummated, all those things are swept up in the text.

24

And I think that's consistent with the way that you

25

would use the phrase in ordinary life.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If I were going to go to my real estate

2

brokers to sell my house, I might gather up a bunch of

3

documents, I might show up at the office at a certain

4

time, in connection with the sale of my house.

5

if the sale falls through and there is no consummated

6

contract, I've still done those things in connection

7

with the sale.

8
9

And even

And as I say, I think courts and the SEC
have consistently taken that position, and if it

10

weren't ­­ if that weren't the case, then egregious

11

frauds would go unremedied, and that would be a

12

tremendous problem.

19

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

I would ask you to write an opinion

20

affirming and that adopts the following rule ­­ and that

21

is that a false promise to purchase securities for one's

22

self in which no other person will have an interest is

23

not a material misrepresentation in connection with the

24

purchase or sale of covered securities.

25

The other side has asked you to adopt a rule

30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that has never been advocated by the SEC in any other

2

proceeding; it's never been advocated, as I understand

3

it, in its briefs in this case; it's never been adopted

4

by any Court ever.

5

for that.

6

And I think there are good reasons

Their theory is that what happened here is

7

that there was a promise to buy covered securities that

8

would be for the benefit of someone else.

9

textual flaws, it doesn't comport with the purpose of

That has two

10

the statute, and it would have extraordinary

11

consequences.

12

It doesn't ­­ it doesn't conform to the text

13

of the statute in either of two ways.

14

which is what the Plaintiffs here purchased, is a

15

defined term.

16

securities that are traded on a national exchange and

17

some of the other additions that would involve, for

18

example, mutual funds.

19

Covered security,

It is a security, but only the subset of

And so Congress didn't say that it was in

20

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

21

security, if it was a covered security that someone else

22

would get the benefit of.

23

It is ­­ what has to be bought here is a

24

stock, and instead, what was bought here was a CD.

25

Mr. Clement says, this is a case of a massive fraud.

31
Alderson Reporting Company

As
He

Official

1

could well have said, this is a case of a massive

2

securities fraud, but it was not a case of a covered

3

securities fraud.

4

that Congress specifically excluded from preclusion

5

under SLUSA.

6

9

The Plaintiffs here bought something

The second textual flaw in their position is
that ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't understand what the

first textual flaw is.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the jumping off

12

point for this flaw?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

So ­­

The jumping off point is

that there ­­ is the defined term "covered security."

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So SLUSA only applies if

17

there was a material misrepresentation in the ­­ in the

18

purchase or sale of a covered security.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, everybody ­­ the case

20

proceeds on the assumption that the ­­ that the CDs were

21

not covered securities.

22

the "in connection with" requirement is met by the

23

allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there

24

would be future purchases and sales of covered

25

securities.

The question is whether it's ­­

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So I'm not sure what ­­ what you're getting

2

out of the fact that covered securities is a ­­ is a

3

defined term.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because Congress asked

5

you ­­ or told the courts to focus on the question of

6

what the product is, that there was a misrepresentation

7

in the course of the transaction, in the course of the

8

purchase or sale, and that is only a covered security.

9

It is not some other product that has, as a benefit, an

10
11

interest in a covered security.
JUSTICE ALITO:

It doesn't say a

12

misrepresentation about the covered security.

13

"a misrepresentation in connection with."

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It says,

That's actually, I think,

15

Your Honor, a really good point for us because the other

16

side's argument, up till the brief ­­ excuse me ­­ up

17

until the oral argument, is that it was a

18

misrepresentation about covered securities that would

19

trigger SLUSA.

20

The problem with their position is that what

21

the Court has always said, when it talked about the

22

definition of "in connection with," is really two

23

things.

24

the ability to deal with novel frauds.

25

metaphysically, everything is connected with everything

It has to be flexible.

We have to give the SEC

And you've pointed out that it's not an

4

easily administered one, but the ­­ the bulwark, the one

5

thing that stops 10b­5 from getting completely out of

16

would be an effect on the regulated market.

it almost verbatim, there was no prospect that this

fraud would have an effect on the covered securities

10

Well, wait.

And ­­ and if

that's ­­ if that's wrong, you acknowledge you don't
win?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, I do not.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

13

difference does it make?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So what

Well, it ­­ it is a ­­ as I

15

understood, they're ­­ they seem to recognize, and if

16

you were to read, for example, their brief in Zandford, they say

17

that the sine qua non of their ability to determine as

18

the enforcement authority here, that something has a ­­

19

is in connection with the purchase or sale of the

20

regulated security is whether it would have an effect on

21

the regulated market.

22

They wrote a brief to you saying that and ­­

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

And you really don't agree

with that anyway.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I think that that is their

35

best hope, and I don't think they can satisfy it.

2

think their authority is narrower still.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We

What ­­ what is your

4

position if the broker says, give me $100,000, and I

5

will buy covered securities, and then he just pockets it

6

and ­­ and flees?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is securities fraud, in

8

our view, according to the SEC's administrative

9

position.

10
11

No court has ever said that ­­ so that's

Justice Scalia's point from the first half­hour.
We can ­­ if that is correct, if the SEC is

12

correct about that, we still prevail because what's

13

happening is the broker is saying, I will purchase for

14

you the covered securities.

15

stands for.

That's what the Line case

16

Their brief in ­­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't see how this

18

case is that much different.

They say, we were going to

19

invest in CDs, and the CDs will be backed by purchase of

20

the securities that we will purchase for you.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So the ­­ the

22

critical difference, I think, is in the definition of

23

I would say is the SEC has always been very clear to you

is, of course, a significant step further than the line

5

that already concerned some members of the Court,

Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas and the late Chief

7

Justice dissented in O'Hagan, and this is a very

8

significant move further than even that case because the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, that's exactly

45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

what I would like you to think about for a second

2

because the last words of Ms. Goldenberg of the SEC,

3

well, if you win, it's going to seriously hamper the SEC

in combatting fraud.

Of course, it wouldn't in a case like this,

can deal with any security, and they did bring a case

If there is going to be a way in which we

14

it's going to be Justice Alito's concern, can you

15

articulate a narrower rule in favor of the Petitioners

16

that says it was the feature that they were covered

securities that was essential to the fraud.

I think we can say, first, that is not in

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

That those words don't

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I do think that this

48
Alderson Reporting Company

1

was not in connection with the purchase or sale.

2

certainly wasn't material to any purchase or sale.

3

the other thing, Justice Alito, is this notion that ­­

that the feature of them being stocks was essential to

5

the fraud would be true in, for example, a loan.

6

It
But

If I say to you, I want to get a loan for

7

$100,000, I promise to buy for myself stocks that I

8

could sell to repay the loan, the only thing that was

9

critical about them is that they were liquid.

And

10

remember, that's actually all that SIB said, is that it

11

had liquid assets.

12

so if we're going to focus on that ­­

13

That's the only feature of it.

features of this case are present, and that is you have

There ­­ no court has ever adopted it.

MR. CLEMENT:

Zandford is a case from this

Court that, essentially, says that as well.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you ­­ among all

the circuit courts, which test would you adopt?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know that I would

11

adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of

12

them make the same mistake, which is they get

13

materiality, and they sneak it into the "in connection

14

with" requirements.

15

So ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

the Sixth Circuit.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Except Judge Sutton in

Yes, and I think, if you were

18

going to accept one test, I would accept ­­ I would ask

19

you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton, but I do

20

think it's a mistake to have materiality or causation

21

slip into the "in connection with" requirement.

22

I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's

23

very apt observation that this fraud here is very

24

similar to the paradigmatic securities fraud where I

25

simply ­­ a broker simply says, give me your money, I

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

will buy securities, and never does.

2

And from the perspective of the defrauded

3

party, it doesn't matter whether what they get in return

4

is a statement that says they own some securities or a

5

statement in a feeder fund that says they have an

6

interest in the Madoff fund or whether they get, here, a

7

CD that they are told by the ­­ the brochure that tells

8

them what this is all about, that it's backed by the

9

investments in the securities.

10
11

They're all one and the

same.
Another thing I have to correct is it's

12

simply not true that the returns here were not variable

13

on the performance of the portfolio.

14

well developed in the record here, but if you want to,

15

we could lodge the brochures that are used to market

16

these things that tell these guys that their returns are

17

variable and that they could lose all of their principal

18

because of the investments in covered securities.

19

A second thing is, of course, Mr. Goldstein

It's not really

20

correctly says there are particular problems when broker

21

dealers lie about covered securities.

22

there are particular problems when an unregistered

23

investment company lies about covered securities.

24

that's what their own complaint says was the reality of

25

these ­­ of the Stanford Investment Bank, that it was an

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, so, too,

And

Official

1
2

unregistered investment company.
That's interesting for two reasons.

One, if

3

it were a registered investment company, all of its

4

securities would be covered securities.

5

way you can get within the covered security band.

6

this idea that Mr. Goldstein proclaims, this is not a

7

covered securities fraud, is simply wrong.

8
9

That's another
So

It is.

It was material to this fraud to make
misrepresentations about purchases of covered

10

securities.

11

going to take their money and we're going to reinvest

12

it ­­ again, words from their complaint ­­ in covered

13

securities, nobody's going to give their money to a bank

14

in Antigua.

15

Without those representations that we're

The reason you give your money to a bank in

16

Antigua is because you think it's backed by something

17

more than a piece of paper, and the something more was

18

purchases of covered securities on the market.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So ­­

Even if you're right

20

about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a

21

representation that this is insured by Lloyds, and there

22

was another claim that they made.

23

you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop

24

anything that has to do with "in connection with the

25

sale or purchase of securities."

56
Alderson Reporting Company

So even ­­ even if

Official

1

We have ­­ oh, we have a claim about the

2

insurance, and we also have a claim that both Antigua

3

and United States were heavily regulated.

4

false.

5

Those were

Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn of

6

the incorrect premise and based on the insurance and the

7

regulated aspects?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

If I can answer?

First of

all, I think that Mr. Goldstein was quite prudent to not

10

defend the Fifth Circuit's rationale.

11

there are other misrepresentations should not mean that

12

a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or

13

sale of covered securities is somehow okay.

14

clear that any misrepresentation is enough.

15

So the fact that

SLUSA makes

Now, the other thing I would say, very

16

briefly, is that they may have an opportunity to try to

17

replead.

18

you that we would be arguing here, where the essence of

19

their claim is to hold the Petitioners secondarily

20

liable for the underlying misrepresentations, they have

21

to sort of have to take them all, but that's the next

22

case.

That, in a sense, is the next case.

23

Thank you, Your Honor.

24
