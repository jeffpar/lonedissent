ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. VANDENBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VANDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.

11

The Patent Act requires particular and

12

distinct claims, but the claim in this case is not

13

particular and distinct.

14

two reasonable readings with very different claim

15

scopes, even after all of the interpretive tools are

16

applied.

17

It is ambiguous because it has

Such ambiguous claims defeat the public

18

notice function which is at the heart of Section 112,

19

and they increase litigation.

20

construction disputes, and they cause more reversals of

21

district court claim construction rulings.

They cause more claim

22

Taken all together, ambiguous claims and the

23

Federal circuit's test allowing ambiguous claims defeats

24

the very purpose of Section 112 and the patent system,

25

namely, to encourage and promote innovation by others

after the first patent issues.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is this claim

3

ambiguous?

4

be close enough so that the user's hand contacts both

5

electrodes, but separate enough to heap ­­ keep

6

electrodes distinct.

7

definite?

8
9

It's evident that these electrodes have to

Why isn't that sufficiently

MR. VANDENBERG:

Your Honor, if ­­ if that

were the only reasonable construction, then that may

10

suffice.

11

construction is that the spaced relationship is a

12

special spacing that causes the electrodes to achieve

13

the desired result.

14

the majority found at the Federal circuit, namely, that

15

spaced relationship is not what it sounds like, namely,

16

any spacing, but rather is a special spacing that is

17

derived by trial­and­error testing to get the spacing

18

just right so that the electrodes detect ­­

19

However, here, the other reasonable

And that was the construction that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't think the

20

majority or the ­­ or the concurrence or the other side

21

disagreed with that.

22

was part of the specifications or not.

I thought that

23

was the only difference between them.

They both agreed

24

ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out ­­ was

25

it the EMGs?

The only question was whether it

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. VANDENBERG:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
So they both agreed that

3

that was part of the scope.

4

part of the specifications or part of the claims,no?

5

both of them make up the scope of the patent.

6

MR. VANDENBERG:

The only issue was, was it
But

Your Honor, we would submit

7

that the disagreements between the judges and, in fact,

8

between Biosig itself went to the scope of the claim,

9

namely, does the scope of the claim cover all ways of

10

achieving the desired result no matter how the

11

electrodes are spaced.

12

That's one possible reading.

The other possible reading is that the

13

claims cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to

14

achieve the desired result.

15

you think of the inventor in 1994 who invents a new

16

material for electrodes, and this new material achieves

17

the desired result of detecting equal muscle signals on

18

the left and right side, regardless of the spacing of

19

the electrode.

20

electrodes, as long as you can touch them, this new

21

material achieved the ­­ the desired goal.

22

And why that matters is if

So it doesn't matter where you put the

That inventor would not know in 1994 if they

23

infringed or not, because if the claims had the

24

interpretation that the majority eventually gave them,

25

namely, that the spaced relationship has this functional

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitation and it must be the result of this

2

trial­and­error balancing, there'd be no infringement.

3

But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there

4

would be infringement.

5

zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against

6

and which deters the innovation.

7

So that is the exact type of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it can't mean

8

any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would

9

know the hand has to cover it.

So you're basically

10

talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of

11

the hand and the other and not too close together

12

they don't ­­ don't work.

13

someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of

14

things and see where ­­ where the trial and error.

15

Trial and error makes ­­ could mean a very difficult

16

thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light

17

bulb.

18

someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try

19

it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so

20

far apart.

21

but

And that seems to me that

But here you've got a very limited range and

But it's not any spaced relationship.

MR. VANDENBERG:

And that's correct, Your

22

Honor, and I do ­­ when I refer to any spacing, it's

23

really a shorthand for any spacing that is narrow enough

24

so that the hand can actually touch both electrodes but

25

not touching.

So I agree that under each interpretation

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable

2

by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other

3

or there'd simply be a single electrode.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would be the

5

purpose of the invention if it were only covering

6

spacing without the function of canceling the EMG?

7

can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would

8

do unless you add its function.

9

MR. VANDENBERG:

I

Well, Your Honor, the

10

purpose of the patent is it would cover possibly, again,

11

all techniques for achieving the desired function.

12

again, going back to the invention of the new material,

13

if the inventor comes up with a specific way of

14

achieving the result, and here they came up with trial

15

and error spacing, they didn't describe that in the

16

patent.

17

inventor until 15 years later.

18

say they had this specific way of achieving it.

19

very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the

20

way they did to have a broader coverage so that they

21

cover all possible ways of achieving that desired

22

result.

MR. VANDENBERG:

12

the person of skill in the art reading the claim is not

14

They're simply trying to figure out, where can I

MR. VANDENBERG:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But ­­ but still the ­­ the

MR. VANDENBERG:

Well, that is the second

We agree.

What happens then?

Our position is that if such a claim, which

21

essentially points in two different directions, is

22

indefinite, the problem with the Federal Circuit's test

23

is the Federal Circuit would not find that indefinite.

24

Instead, the Federal Circuit would pick one because it's

amenable to construction.

special spacings of the electrodes that are a result of

the test needs to include what the skilled artisan would

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its

Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its

construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a

skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in

the art could reasonably construe the scope of this

patent.

Its focus is not always on that question.

MR. HARRIS:

from the way the Federal Circuit actually applied the

standard in this case that the Federal Circuit was

looking to what the evidence was as to what skilled

artisans would do with this claim language.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN D. VANDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VANDENBERG:

Thank you.

I think the ­­

the essential points here are, first, the emphatic

53
Alderson Reporting Company

language that Congress chose, and then thinking about

2

ambiguous claims.

There is no legitimate need for

3

ambiguous claims.

There is a strong economic incentive

4

for patent attorneys to draft ambiguous claims, not to

5

put all their eggs in that basket.

6

claims in case some copyist comes along, but they want

7

ambiguous claims so they can ­­ their client can treat

8

it as a nose of wax later, as happened here.

9

well established in the patent bar, that there is this

They want some clear

That is

10

strong economic incentive.

11

ample tools to avoid ambiguous claims if this Court

12

tells them that it will no longer be permitted.

13

that is the key here, is that there's a strong economic

14

incentive.

15

the best position to avoid the ambiguity that Congress

16

prohibits and therefore, the problem is, the Federal

17

Circuit has blessed ambiguity with its test.

18

order to stop all of the problems that the amici have

19

pointed out that are caused by ambiguous claims, we

20

submit this Court needs to be clear and go back to

21

United Carbon and General Electric and to the statutory

22

text and be clear that ambiguity is simply not

23

permitted.

24
25

But patent attorneys have

That ­­

In terms of how the Federal Circuit ruled
here, and we point to the majority's opinion at petition

appendix 15(a), the court, the majority, definitely

2

applied the insolubly ambiguous test.

3

"Because the term was amenable to construction,

4

indefiniteness here would require a showing that a

5

person of ordinary skill would find spaced relationship

6

to be insolubly ambiguous."

7

rejects that test, we submit, at the very least, the

8

Court cannot affirm the judgment below on that basis.

They said,

And therefore, if the Court

But more importantly ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Federal Circuit

11

said something ­­ I'm looking at the petition appendix

12

at 20(a) ­­ that sounded very close to what the

13

government standard is.

14

"that the claim provides parameters sufficient for a

15

skilled artisan to understand the bounds of spaced

16

relationship."

17

government says and it isn't ­­ they don't say anything

18

about insoluble in ­­ in that statement.

It said, "Sufficiently" ­­

That sounds very close to what the

MR. VANDENBERG:

It is true that here in

20

some of their cases, the court will ­­ the Federal

21

Circuit will use language like that saying that one

24

General Electric required.

And in terms of the two different claim

scopes, we would simply invite the Court's attention

4

back to our reply brief at page 20, which explained the

5

different claim scopes.

6

misunderstood the point, and therefore, in the reply, we

7

amplified it some more.

We think the government

But as ­­ as I said, the Court at the very
least should not affirm.

here for the Court to create another concrete guide

service to the patent bar in applying the correct law to

13

an actual patent claim, creating concrete guide posts

14

for Section 101 and 103.

15

trial courts need another concrete guide post if

applying the correct law of Section 112, paragraph 2 to
