CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Greece v. Galloway.

Mr. Hungar.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

8
9
10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The court of appeals correctly held that the

12

legislative prayers at issue in this case were not

13

offensive in the way identified as problematic in Marsh,

14

but the court then committed legal error by engrafting

15

the endorsement test onto Marsh as a new barrier to the

16

practice of legislative prayer.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Hungar, I'm wondering

18

what you would think of the following:

19

we began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice

20

had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom,

21

facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the

22

spectators.

23

suppose that, as

And the minister had asked everyone to stand

24

and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister said

25

the following ­­ he said, we acknowledge the saving

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.

2

strength from his resurrection.

3

raised up the Lord Jesus.

4

turn and put us by his side.

5

who had stood responded amen, made the sign of the

6

cross, and the Chief Justice then called your case.

Blessed are you who has

You who will raise us in our
The members of the Court

7

Would that be permissible?

8

MR. HUNGAR:

9

We draw

I don't think so, Your Honor.

And, obviously, this case doesn't present that question

10

because what we have here is a case of legislative

11

prayer in the Marsh doctrine, which recognizes that the

12

history of this country, from its very foundations and

13

founding, recognize the propriety of legislative prayer

14

of the type that was conducted here.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the question ­­
So you are making a distinction just between

17

the legislature and any other official proceeding; is

18

that correct?

19

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, clearly, Marsh involves

20

legislative prayer, the tradition that we rely on

21

involves legislative prayer, and this case involves

22

legislative prayer.

23

other contexts would depend on the context.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Whether ­­ what rule might apply in

Well, suppose I ask the

exact same question, same kinds of statements, same sort

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of context, except it's not in a courtroom.

2

it's in a congressional hearing room.

3

Instead,

Maybe it's a confirmation hearing, maybe

4

it's an investigatory hearing of some kind, and that a

5

person is sitting at a table in front of the members of

6

a committee, ready to testify, ready to give his

7

testimony in support of his nomination.

8

The minister says the exact same thing.

9

MR. HUNGAR:

I think that's a ­­ that's a

10

closer question because of the congressional history,

11

but, of course, at least as far as I'm aware, they have

12

this history as it applies to the legislative body as a

13

whole, not to committees, but it would be a different

14

question.

15

One, obviously, important distinguishing

16

factor there, in addition to the fact that it's not the

17

legislative body as a whole ­­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. HUNGAR:

We should ­­ we should ­­
­­ is that people are compelled

20

to attend and testify under oath, which is a different

21

situation from the one here.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I suppose ­­
We should assume ­­ to ­­

24

to make it parallel to what occurred here, that the next

25

day, before the same committee, a Muslim would lead the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

invocation and the day after that, an orthodox Jew.

2

mean ­­

3

MR. HUNGAR:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

Yes, Your Honor.
­­ it makes a difference

5

whether it's just one ­­ one denomination that is being

6

used as ­­ as chaplain or open to various denominations.

7

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

That's why we believe this case is actually an easier

9

case than Marsh because, in Marsh, there was a paid

10
11
12
13

chaplain from the same denomination for 16 years.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question,

Mr. Hungar ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

14

Mr. Hungar, for 11 years, the prayers sounded almost

15

exclusively like the ones that I read, and one year, on

16

four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up,

17

to have a Baha'i minister or a ­­ a Wiccan, but for the

18

most part, not out of any malice or anything like that,

19

but because this is what the people in this community

20

knew and were familiar with and what most of the

21

ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this?

22

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, no.

I mean, it's clearly

23

not correct that most of the prayers sounded like the

24

one you just read.

25

Most of the prayers that ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your position is that

6
Alderson Reporting Company

wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have ­­

2

you have ­­ you have two limitations, proselytizing and

3

disparaging.

4

question gets at ­­ place ­­ place limitations.

And ­­ but I think Justice Kagan's

5

One could read your brief and say, well, it

6

doesn't matter; it could be an executive body, it could

7

be a court, it could be a town meeting, a school board,

8

a zoning board, a utilities board.

9

case about prayer at the beginning of a legislative

That's ­­ is this

10

session, or is it about prayer in all three branches of

11

government?

12

MR. HUNGAR:

This case is about prayer at

13

the beginning of a legislative session.

14

what the meetings at issue here are ­­ are about.

15

That's what the board of the Town of Greece is.

16

fact, Respondents try to argue that this is somehow what

17

they call coercive because there are public hearings

18

that are held.

19

That's exactly

In

But the public hearings are held at least

20

30 minutes after the prayer, and anyone coming for the

21

purpose of the public hearing can easily show up after

22

the prayer, if they don't want to be there.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why ­­ why was it that you

24

so promptly answered Justice Kagan's question to the

25

effect that this would be a violation?

7
Alderson Reporting Company

What ­­ why

Official

would there be a violation in the instance she put?

2

MR. HUNGAR:

I'm sorry.

Which instance,

Your Honor?

be a First Amendment violation.

8
9

You seemed readily to agree that that would

MR. HUNGAR:

Why?

Well, perhaps I conceded too

much, but I think the important distinction is between

10

the ­­ both the judicial context and the legislative

11

context, on the one hand, and the ­­ the absence of a ­­

12

of a comparable history that shows that it did not ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is it ­­ is it

14

simply history that makes ­­ there's no rational

15

explanation?

16

It's just a historical aberration?

MR. HUNGAR:

No, it's not ­­ it's not a

17

question of historical aberration.

18

of ­­

19
20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a question

Well, what's ­­ what's the

justification for the distinction?
MR. HUNGAR:

It's a question of what the

22

Establishment Clause has understood, both at the time

23

and throughout history, to forbid and not to forbid.

24

The judiciary is different than a legislature.

25

Legislatures can be partisan, the judiciary should not

8
Alderson Reporting Company

2

be.

People are compelled to testify under oath.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you ­­ but you ­­ you

3

had no problem, Mr. Hungar, with the marshal's

4

announcement at the ­­ at the beginning of this session.

5

"God save the United States and this Honorable Court."

6

There ­­ there are many people who don't believe in God.

7
8
9

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And clearly ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. HUNGAR:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. HUNGAR:

So that's okay?
Yes.
Why ­­ why is that okay?
Whether ­­ if ­­ perhaps I

13

misunderstood the hypothetical.

14

as you described, with a different minister, with ­­

15

with an open process, a nondiscriminatory process like

16

the one we have here, I think it would be a much closer

17

case than this one, but it might be constitutional.

If the hypothetical is,

18

But whether that case is constitutional or

19

not, this case is far from the constitutional line ­­

20

further from the constitutional line than the State

21

legislature's practice in Marsh because, there, Nebraska

22

had one chaplain from one denomination for 16 years, and

23

yet, that was constitutionally permissible.

24

And his prayers were not distinguishable in

25

content from the prayers at issue here during the time

9

that was relevant to the case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don’t think that if the Chief ­­
Would it make a

4

difference in your analysis if instead of, as I

5

understand the hypothetical, there was a point of

6

saying, all rise, or something of that sort?

7

Would it make a difference if the

8

hypothetical Justice Kagan posed were the same, except

9

people weren't told to rise or invited to rise or, in

10

fact, were told to stay seated, something like that, so

11

there would be no indication of who was participating in

12

the prayer?

13
14
15

Is that a ­­ is that a ground of distinction
that you're willing to accept or not?
MR. HUNGAR:

I don't think that is

16

constitutionally significant, unless ­­ I mean, it might

17

be different if people are compelled to stand, but

18

whether they are or not ­­ I mean, in the Marsh case

19

itself, Senator Chambers testified that the practice in

20

the Nebraska legislature was for people to stand.

21

And he felt coerced to stand because when he

22

was there ­­ he tried to avoid it ­­ but when he was

23

there, he felt he needed to stand because everybody else

24

was doing it, and he needed to have dealings with these

25

people as a fellow legislator.

26

The Court, nonetheless, held that he's an

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adult, and he ­­ he is expected to be able to disagree

2

with things that he disagrees with, and that is not a

3

constitutional violation.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I wonder how far you

5

can carry the ­­ your historical argument and whether

6

some of these things are properly regarded as more

7

historical artifacts, right?

8

God we trust," right?

9

for a long time, right?

10

MR. HUNGAR:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, our motto is, "In

That's the motto.

It's been that

Yes, sir.
But wouldn't we look

12

at it differently if there were ­­ suddenly, if there

13

were a proposal today, for the first time, to say let's

14

adopt a motto, "In God we trust"?

15

the same way, simply because it's ­­ in other words, the

16

history doesn't make it clear that a particular practice

17

is okay going on in the future.

18

Would we view that

It means, well, this is what they've done ­­

19

they have done, so we're not going to go back and

20

revisit it, just like we're not going to go back and

21

take the cross out of every city seal that's been there

22

since ­­ you know, 1800.

23

would be okay to adopt a seal today that would have a

24

cross in it, does it?

25

MR. HUNGAR:

But it doesn't mean that it

Not necessarily.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

But ­­ but I

Official

1

think history is clearly important to the Establishment

2

Clause analysis under this Court's precedents in two

3

significant respects, both of which apply here, one of

4

which might not apply in your ­­ with respect to your

5

hypothetical.

6

The first being the history shows us that

7

the practice of legislative prayer, just like the motto,

8

has not, in fact, led to an establishment, and,

9

therefore, we can be confident it is not in danger of

10

doing so.

11

prayer, unlike your hypothetical, goes back to the very

12

framing of the First Amendment.

13

And, secondly, the history of legislative

The fact that ­­ and this is what the Court

14

said in Marsh ­­ the fact that at the very time the

15

first Congress was writing and sending the ­­ the First

16

Amendment out to the States to be ratified, they adopted

17

the practice of having a congressional chaplain.

18

the congressional chaplains ­­ the record ­­ the

19

historical record is clear ­­ gave prayers that were

20

almost exclusively sectarian, as Respondents define that

21

word.

Was it constitutional in the past?

How can it be that, if the

MR. HUNGAR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
If it was constitutional in

3

the past, why ­­ why would it be unconstitutional if the

4

same thing is done today, even without any past parallel

practice?

That's a nice alliteration.

MR. HUNGAR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

I think this Court's precedents

10

have also indicated, at least in some cases, that if ­­

11

if a practice is constitutional, as we know it to be the

12

case because of the fact that it has been understood to

13

be constitutional and consistent with our religion

14

clauses from the founding, other practices that have no

15

greater impact, no greater tendency to establish

16

religion, are equally constitutional.

17

And we believe that is an

appropriate doctrine.

respects.

government prayer over the course of our founding, which

First of all, the Becket Fund amicus brief

And, secondly, Congress for much of its ­­

here is a legislative meeting of a legislative body, and

undergird the Establishment Clause are equally

11

consistent with the position we're advancing here.

12

As the ­­ as your opinion in the County of

13

Allegheny case indicates, the fundamental ­­ the core of

14

Establishment Clause concern is coercion or conduct that

15

is so extreme that it leads to the establishment of a

religion because it is putting the government squarely

ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Second Circuit's decision here requires

7

courts to determine when a legislature has permitted too

8

many sectarian references in its prayers or has invited

9

too many Christian prayer­givers.

10
11

That approach is

flawed for two reasons.
First, it cannot be squared with our

12

nation's long history of opening legislative sessions,

13

not only with a prayer, but a prayer given in the

14

prayer­giver's own religious idiom.

15

invites exactly the sort of parsing of prayer that Marsh

16

sought to avoid and that Federal courts are ill­equipped

17

to handle ­­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, second, it

And what was the purpose

19

of Marsh saying that proselytizing or damning another

20

religion would be a constitutional violation?

So we agree with ­­

20

to address the coercion point this way:

town councils, it's our view that, as a general matter,

18

And,

promises, our Constitution promises, It's that, however

21

we worship, we're all equal and full citizens.

22

think we can all agree on that.

Here's what our ­­ our country

And I

23

And that means that, when we approach the

24

government, when we petition the government, we do so

25

not as a Christian, not as a Jew, not as a Muslim, not

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as a nonbeliever, only as an American.

2

And what troubles me about this case is

3

that, here, a citizen is going to a local community

4

board, supposed to be the closest, the most responsive

5

institution of government that exists, and is

6

immediately being asked ­­ being forced to identify

7

whether she believes in the things that most of the

8

people in the room believe in, whether she belongs to

9

the same religious team as most of the people in the

10
11

room do.
And it strikes me that that might be

12

inconsistent with this understanding that, when we

13

relate to our government, we all do so as Americans and

14

not as Jews and not as Christians and not as

15

nonbelievers.

16

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Justice Kagan, I think

17

we agree with much of what you say.

18

difference here is that this approaching of the

19

government body occurs against the backdrop of 240 years

20

of history, which makes this different.

21

But ­­ but with the

From the very beginning of our legislature,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If you ask a

it's a much narrower test.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me give you an example

21

of a practice that's a little bit different.

22

you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of

23

Greece does.

Maybe

24

First of all, this town starts out by

25

making ­­ by proceeding in a more systematic and

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the month

2

or whatever it is.

3

the houses of worship within the town, it identifies

4

places of worship that may be outside the town

5

boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a

6

minority religion may attend.

So, instead of just looking to all

7

And it makes it clear that it's open to

8

chaplains of any religious ­­ of any religion on a

9

rotating basis.

And then they have ­­ they structure

10

their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then

11

the legislative part of the town meeting.

12

And then there's a clear separation in time

13

and access between that part of the proceeding and the

14

hearing where variances and things of that nature are

15

held.

16

Now, you would still say that's

17

unconstitutional because you have to add on that a

18

prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it?

19

there any other problem with what I've just outlined?

20

MR. LAYCOCK:

Is

Well, if the separation in

21

time really works, that's part of the remedy that we've

suggested is possible here.

23

prayers should be nonsectarian.

position.

Once a month.

With respect to coercion, it's

58
Alderson Reporting Company

That would be

Official

1

unquestionably true that there is less ­­ less basis for

2

claiming coercion here than there was in Marsh.

3

In Marsh, Senator Chambers was required to

4

be on the Senate floor by rule, he had to be there to do

5

his job, and the practice was to stand every single

6

time, which he did because he felt coerced to do it;

7

whereas, here, the record suggests that there were three

8

times when somebody requested people to stand out of 121

9

occasions.

10

The idea that this is more coercive than

Marsh is absurd.

11

In Marsh, the Court expressly rejected a

12

coercion argument saying, "We expect adults to be able

13

to deal with this."

14

And, with respect to the history, as well, I

15

think the debate in the Continental Congress, when this

16

issue was first raised, shows what the American

17

tradition has been; that is, Americans are not bigots,

18

and we can stand to hear a prayer delivered in a

19

legislative forum by someone whose views we do not agree

20

with.

21

why it doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.

That is the tradition in this country, and that is

22

And, finally, with respect to the fact that

23

this is a municipality, rather than a state or local ­­

24

or Federal government, that can't possibly make a

25

difference as an Establishment Clause matter.

with in the legislative context.

Respondents' theories also conflict with the
