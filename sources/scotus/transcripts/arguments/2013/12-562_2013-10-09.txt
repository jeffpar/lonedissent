ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The merits question in this case is whether

12

the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies

13

when a taxpayer overstates his basis in property in

14

connection with the transaction that is later determined

15

to be a sham.

16

whether the court, in this TEFRA partnership level

17

proceeding, has authority to decide that merits issue.

18

The threshold jurisdictional question is

I'd like to begin with the jurisdictional

19

question.

20

the text, I'd like to make two quick preliminary

21

observations about jurisdiction.

22

question we say is appropriate for resolution in

23

partnership level proceedings is not whether any

24

individual partner will actually be made to pay the

25

penalty.

And before I focus the Court's attention on

The first is that the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

There's no question in this case that the

2

determination whether the penalty will actually be

3

imposed on individual partners and, if so, in what

4

amount is properly reserved for partner level

5

proceedings.

6

The question is simply whether the Court, in

7

the partnership level proceeding, can make the threshold

8

determination whether the sort of error that the IRS

9

identifies on the partnership return can trigger a

10

penalty down the road if the individual partner prepares

11

his or her return in a manner consistent with the

12

partnership return.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

I thought I

14

understood that to be your point in your brief, but I ­­

15

there is one thing missing from here.

16

you were saying that you could impose the penalty before

17

the amount was determined on the partnership level, that

18

the tax that you could, without a notice of deficiency,

19

require a payment upfront.

20

MR. STEWART:

I also thought

There are two separate

21

questions here.

22

the partnership level?

23

proceedings are complete, there are subsidiary partner

24

level proceedings.

25

require a deficiency notice, some partner level

The first is what can be determined at
And once the partnership level

And some partner level proceedings

4
Alderson Reporting Company

2

proceedings do not.
Now, it is part of our position that, once

3

the applicability of the penalty has been determined at

4

the partnership level, the penalty can then be imposed

5

on individual partners in partner level proceedings

6

without a deficiency notice.

7

through a refund proceeding, but because ­­ there's

8

never the imposition of additional tax or penalties on

9

the partnership itself.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It can still be challenged

That is the incongruity

11

of your position in my mind.

12

decision of ­­ of whether or not or what the true value

13

is of the basis and how much needs to be paid can't be

14

determined until the partnership level ­­ until the

15

partner level determination, yet you're claiming that

16

you're entitled to an amount of money beforehand, before

17

that decision is made.

18

about that.

19

MR. STEWART:

You claim that the

There's a tension in my mind

Let me explain, as best I can,

20

the sequence of events that we think would unfold if

21

this Court affirmed our view of the ­­ both held that

22

the courts below had jurisdiction and agreed with our

23

view of the way the penalty is supposed to operate.

24

If the Court agreed with the position that

25

we take in Part 2 of our merits brief, namely, that a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deduction that is claimed in connection with a

2

transaction that is later determined to be a sham can

3

trigger ­­ if they agree ­­ if you agree with us on that

4

legal issue, then the IRS would examine the returns of

5

the individual partners, and it would verify that they

6

did, in fact, claim deductions in connection with this

7

transaction because they would have this Court's

8

agreement with the proposition that that's the sort of

9

thing that can trigger the penalty.

10

They would then determine what the amount of

11

the overpayment ­­ of the underpayment was, and they

12

would, presumably, assess a 40 percent penalty on that.

13

There would be a subsidiary question because the FPAA,

14

the Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, said

15

that the partnerships were shams.

16

individual transactions, the purchases and sales of the

17

options and the currency and the stock, they would be

18

treated as though they had been engaged in ­­ by the

19

individual partners.

But it also said that the

20

And so at the partner level, there might be

21

further determinations about what ­­ what a relatively

22

small amount of tax the individual partners would ­­

23

would owe on that.

24

penalty were assessed on the partner, the partner would

25

have to pay the penalty before challenging it in through

And then if a partner ­­ if a

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a refund action.

2

what ground could the partner want to challenge the

3

penalty at that point.

4

But ­­ but we might want to ask on

The partner couldn't at that stage want to

5

make the argument that's being made in this Court,

6

namely, that this is just not the sort of situation to

7

which the substantial valuation misstatement penalty

8

applies because that issue would have already been

9

resolved against the partner in this proceeding by

10

hypothesis, if the Court agrees with us on the merits.

11

And so the partner would have had an opportunity to get

12

that threshold legal issue resolved without prepaying

13

the penalty first.

14

Now, if an individual partner wanted to

15

raise the good faith reasonable cause defects that's

16

provided in 26 USC 6664(c), the partner would have to

17

pay the penalty first before seeking a refund.

18

that's pretty clearly consistent with Congress's intent

19

because Congress specified in TEFRA itself that, after

20

the court in the partnership level proceeding has

21

determined the applicability of the penalty, the partner

22

can still, through refund proceedings, contend that the

23

penalty was erroneously imposed.

24
25

And that language tells us two things.

But

It

tells us, first, that Congress didn't see any necessary

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unfairness in requiring a partner to pay the penalty

2

first before raising certain sorts of challenges.

3

And it also indicates that, by

4

applicability, Congress must have meant something

5

different from will the penalty ultimately be imposed

6

because, if the partnership level determination that the

7

penalty was applicable meant that all the requirements

8

for imposition were satisfied, there'd be no room for

9

the partner to argue down the road that the penalty was

10
11

erroneously assessed after all.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So ­­
Mr. Stewart, can you

12

explain the difference in the two proceedings?

13

your position that the proper review is of the final

14

partnership administrative adjustment.

15

First,

How would the penalty be adjudicated in that

16

format, and if your ­­ if the taxpayer is right, that

17

the adjudication must be made at the partner level

18

proceeding, what would be the difference in the

19

character of the adjudication?

20

MR. STEWART:

When we say that the

21

applicability of the penalty should be determined in the

22

partnership level proceeding, all we mean is that the

23

court in the partnership level proceeding should resolve

24

the legal issue that is addressed in Part 2 of the

25

respective briefs for the Petitioner and the Respondent;

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that is, the court should determine is the substantial

2

valuation misstatement penalty the sort of penalty that

3

can apply to a basis overstatement that is produced

4

through a sham transaction.

5

We wouldn't ask the court in the partnership

6

level proceeding to go beyond that legal determination

7

and to ask whether individual partners had actually

8

underpaid their tax or whether they had actually

9

misstated basis.

It's always theoretically possible in

10

a case like this that the partnership could be

11

determined ­­ that the partner could participate in sham

12

transactions.

13

But by the time it was ­­ he had to file his

14

own return, he could get cold feet or he could get legal

15

advice that indicated this just isn't going to work, and

16

so it's possible that the partner could prepare his

17

return in a way that was lawful.

18

partnership level proceedings were complete, would have

19

to look at the partner return in order to see what that

20

had ­­ what had happened.

And the IRS, after the

21

I think the main practical ­­ I'm sorry.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was just going to ask, if

23

the question were determined of whether the sham

24

transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the

25

basis, if that were determined at the partner level and

9
Alderson Reporting Company

not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to

2

have different outcomes ­­

3

MR. STEWART:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

Yes, absolutely.
­­ with respect to

different partners?
MR. STEWART:

Absolutely.

And I think

7

that's the main practical difference between the way the

8

system would operate under our view of TEFRA and the way

9

it would operate under Respondent's view.

MR. STEWART:

Exactly.

Under Respondent's

14

view, the IRS was not required to say anything at all in

15

the FPAA about the potential imposition of basis

16

overstatement penalties down the road.

17

adjustments ­­ the shamming determination had been

18

upheld at the partnership level, under Respondent's

19

view, the IRS could then assess penalties against

20

individual partners.

21

If the FPAA

And if the individual partners raised an

22

objection, the same arguments that are raised in Part 2

23

of the Respondent's merits briefs, that would have to be

24

litigated potentially by different judges in different

25

partnership ­­ in different partner level proceedings

10
Alderson Reporting Company

with potentially inconsistent outcomes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would it be a fair way to

3

look at this to say that what you do at the partnership

4

level is anything that doesn't require looking at an

5

individual's tax return?

6

MR. STEWART:

I think that's a fair way to

7

put it.

8

that will necessarily have the same answer for all

9

partners should presumptively be resolved at the

And another way we would put it is any question

10

partnership level.

11

briefed in Part 2 of the parties' respective merits

12

briefs, we may be right, Respondent may be right, but the

13

answer is going to be the same for all partners.

14

this is the sort of basis overstatement that can trigger

15

the penalty or it isn't.

16

That is, the legal issue that's

Either

The second practical difference that I

17

wanted to ­­ to allude to, at least briefly, between our

18

position and the Respondent's is that 6226(f) is the

19

provision that deals with the Court's jurisdiction in a

20

partnership level proceeding.

21

that tells the IRS what it's supposed to do at the

22

partnership level, and it also tells the IRS determine

23

the applicability of any penalty that's related to an

24

adjustment to a partnership item.

25

6221 is the provision

Now ­­ now, one advantage of requiring the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

IRS to make at least this sort of threshold

2

determination of penalties at the outset is that, if the

3

IRS makes an adjustment to a partnership item, and the

4

IRS believes that it is the sort of adjustment that down

5

the road could trigger the imposition of penalties,

6

that's the sort of thing an individual partner would

7

want to know in deciding whether to challenge the

8

adjustment.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that your

10

position would allow the IRS to evade the normal statute

11

of limitations?

12

MR. STEWART:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. STEWART:

I don't see ­­
Or deficiency?
I don't see how.

No?
I'm not sure

15

exactly what argument you're referring to.

16

are ­­ I mean, there are provisions that deal with the

17

way the limitations periods runs, depending on when the

18

partnership return is filed and when the partner returns

19

are filed, but I don't see how that would happen.

20

But there

We ­­ we would still be subject in assessing

21

penalties against any individual partners to whatever

22

limitations period the code provides and either we would

23

or would not have obtained a legal ruling on ­­ on the

24

legal issue whether the penalties are ­­ are the sort

25

that could follow from this partnership item adjustment,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but I don't think it would have implications for the

2

statute of limitations.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Using the language of the

4

statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what

5

is the adjustment of the partnership item?

6

statute says, "Determine the applicability of any

7

penalty which relates to the adjustment of a partnership

8

item."

9

adjustment?

10

That is, the

So what is ­­ what was the partnership item

MR. STEWART:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

This

11

is on Page 6­A of the appendix to the government’s

12

brief, and the adjustment to the partnership item is the

13

shamming determination.

14

partnerships were not engaged in for business purposes,

15

that they were engaged in purely as tax avoidance

16

measures.

17

The determination that the

And Respondent concedes that this is a

18

partnership item because Respondent concedes that the

19

district court had authority to review the shamming

20

determination, decide whether that determination was

21

appropriate.

22

upon the proposition that the determination that the

23

partnerships are shams was an adjustment to a

24

partnership item.

25

And that concession necessarily depends

And it makes sense for two reasons.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

First,

Official

1

because the determination whether these are valid

2

partnerships necessarily underlies any other

3

determination that the IRS would make about the proper

4

tax treatment of items reported on the partnership

5

return.

6

And second, it is the sort of determination

7

that is going to have one answer for every partner,

8

either the partnership is a sham or it's not.

9

can't be the case that a particular partnership is a

10
11

But it

sham with respect to some partners and not others.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What Judge Sentelle

12

said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that

13

based ­­ agreeing with everything you've said, that

14

means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on

15

the individual partner's returns.

16

might be obvious, but it still is made on those returns,

17

and therefore, that doesn't fall as a partnership item.

18

MR. STEWART:

What's wrong with it

Now, we would agree with Judge

19

Sentelle that outside basis, in and of itself, is not a

20

partnership item.

21

is not designated as one of the things that the court in

22

a partnership level proceeding can determine.

23

there ­­ and usually, it would be inappropriate to

24

determine outside basis at that stage because,

25

typically, outside basis will vary from partner to

But there are some instances in which a
court needs to determine outside basis ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Why would it

vary from partner to partner?
MR. STEWART:

I mean, in the ­­ in the more

7

typical case, the outside basis would depend upon the

8

amount that a particular partner had paid for his own

9

partnership interest.

And so, in that situation, not

10

every partner would necessarily have ­­ have paid the

11

same thing.

12

which ­­ in order to make some determination that is

13

specified in 6226(f), the court and the IRS along the

14

way have to determine outside basis.

15

But there are fairly rare situations in

And one example we gave on page 32 of our

16

brief, we have a footnote that says, it's not implicated

17

here, but outside basis is sometimes a component of a

18

partnership item, such as inside basis.

19

case that was ultimately decided by this Court, but it's

20

a case in which a partnership took advantage of code

21

proceedings that said you can step up your inside basis

22

to max the outside basis of your partner ­­ partners.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we cite a

MR. STEWART:

Or am I misstating that?

in order to determine whether the substantial valuation

5

misstatement penalty would be triggered down the road,

6

the IRS and the Court would have to make certain ­­

7

8

a sham partnership.

9

If a lawyer were asked for ­­ if a lawyer

10

saw an adjustment that said we regard these partnerships

11

as shams, and the lawyer were asked, does that mean that

12

I could be subject to the substantial valuation

misstatement penalty if I reported deductions on

14

purported losses from that partnership, the only way the

15

lawyer would answer that question is to ask, well,

what's true basis in a sham partnership?

6

inside basis is a partnership item, you can only

determine that partnership item by reference to outside

8

basis.

And since

9

Here, we have a somewhat different argument.

10

We're saying the thing that had to be determined at the

11

partnership level was the applicability of the

12

penalties.

13

substantial valuation misstatement penalty is applicable

14

is to determine what would be true basis in a sham

14

are limited to 20 percent, whereas some can be bumped up

15

to 40 percent, and we would look for the 40 percent

16

penalty.

17

Some of the penalties

But if I could, on page 18a, we're talking

18

about Section 6662(b), and it says, "Portion of

19

underpayment to which section applies."

20

says, "This section shall apply to the portion of any

21

underpayment which is attributable to one or more of the

22

following," and then it lists six items.

23

is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty that

24

we're relying on here.

25

And then it

Subsection (3)

Subsection (6) is a disallowance of claimed

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

tax benefits by reason of a transaction lacking economic

2

substance.

3

That's the ­­ the 2010 penalty.

Now, the two points I would make are, first,

4

it's very clear that many, many cases that would fall

5

under Subsection (6) would also fall under Subsection

6

(1) or (2); that is, they could involve negligence or

7

disregard of rules or regulations.

8
9

They could also involve a substantial
understatement of income tax, which basically means any

10

understatement of income tax that's 10 percent or more

11

of the true tax owed.

12

in saying Subsection (6) should apply to some cases

13

where (1) and (2) would also apply, there shouldn't be

14

any greater incongruity in saying it can apply to some

15

cases where Subsection (3) would apply.

16

And so if there's no incongruity

The other point I would make pertains to the

17

introductory language of that provision, and it says,

18

"This section shall apply to the portion of any

19

underpayment, which is attributable to one or more of

20

the following."

21

significance of the "one or more" language is that it

22

functions as an anti­stacking provision.

23

it doesn't matter whether your underpayment triggers

24

only one of these penalties or all six of them; you're

25

still limited to 20 percent, unless you can get the ­­

It

I guess the two things that ­­

or at least two things I would say in response to that

17

are that here the whole point of the avoidance scheme

18

was to create an artificially inflated basis; that is,

19

the high, high basis that's claimed on the individual's

20

returns was not simply a fortuitous result of an

21

avoidance scheme that operated through some other means.

22

The whole point ­­ if you want to claim a

23

loss on a transaction where you didn't incur an actual

24

economic loss, you can do it either by under ­­ by

And this is one of a

determined to be a sham, but the sham determination was

6

intimately bound up with the fact that the whole purpose

7

of the scheme was to create an inflated basis.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand that,

but if you were telling people what happened here ­­

10

maybe you would ­­ I don't know that your first

11

statement would be, they overstated their basis.

12

think you would say, they engaged in a completely sham

13

transaction, which had ­­ which had some obvious, as the

14

D.C. Circuit put it, some obvious consequences.

15

still, the ­­ the driving determination was that it was

16

a sham transaction.

17

MR. STEWART:

I

But

I guess the ­­ the other

18

couple of points I would make are, there's nothing

19

illegal about engaging in a transaction that lacks

20

economic substance; that is, if the partners had engaged

21

in these offsetting currency transactions, but then had

22

decided before filing their return that either we ­­ we

23

no longer believe that this is right conduct or we

24

believe we're going to get caught, and they had prepared

25

their returns in a lawful way, nothing bad would have

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

happened to them.
The ­­ the thing that subjects them to

3

potential penalties is the fact that they claimed a

4

large loss on their tax returns, and they did that by

5

claiming a large false basis in the ­­ the partnership.

6

The second thing I would say is ­­ you know,

7

when I took math in junior high and high school, the

8

teacher would always tell us to show your work when you

9

handed in an assignment, don't just give the answer at

10

the end; indicate the process by which you arrived at

11

that number.

12

And in essence, when the code says impose

13

penalties on underpayments that are attributable to the

14

following things, it says ­­ it means we're going to

15

look at your work.

16

too little tax, we're going to look at the calculation

17

process by which you arrived at the amount on your own

return and figure out where you went wrong.

19

When we determine that you have paid

And if they did that here, they would say

20

the mistake these taxpayers made, the reason that they didn't

pay as much tax as they owed, was not that they claimed

22

to have sold the assets ­­ it was not that they claimed

to have sold the assets for less than they actually

realized; it was that they claimed a basis that had ­­

And the last thing I would say in ­­ in

connection with that is it's no accident that this

scheme operated through the creation of sham

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
On both jurisdiction and the merits, the

19

government is asking this Court to adopt an overly

20

expansive interpretation of the code to reach a result

21

that would upset the statutory scheme devised by

22

Congress and lead to further problems down the road.

23

Now, on jurisdiction, I think the most

24

important thing for the Court to recognize is that

25

outside basis, the very thing, as you can tell from my

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

friend's arguments on the merits, that the imposition of

2

this penalty depends on is not a partnership item.

3

fact ­­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In

Mr. Garre, it seems as

5

though you and the government agree on sort of the

6

nature of this problem, right, which is you have a

7

partnership item, which is the sham determination.

8

leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you

9

just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an

10
11

That

affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right?
So there's kind of three things, two steps

12

in the process.

13

essentially, because the penalty has to directly relate

14

to a partnership item.

15

because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the

16

partnership item.

17

And you say, well, that's not enough,

And they say it is enough

And I guess the question is, in some sense,

18

you're both adding adjectives to the statute.

19

directly, they add indirectly.

20

those?

21

MR. GARRE:

You add

How do we pick between

Well, I think the government is

22

asking the Court to add a great deal more than that.

23

Just to go to the statutory text, with the provision at

24

6226, and it's on page 2A of the red brief, and what

25

that says is that first it gives the court jurisdiction

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to determine all partnership items.

2

that outside basis is not a partnership item.

3

Everybody agrees

And then it gives jurisdiction to the court

4

to determine penalties that relate to partnership items.

5

And what ­­ and what the government is asking this Court

6

to do is, essentially, to read this to say that relates

7

to partnership items or that relates to non­partnership

8

affected items, like outside basis.

9

And the reason why the Court shouldn't do

10

that is, first, in a scheme that divides the world into

11

partnership items that can be determined at the

12

partnership level and non­partnership items that must go

13

to the partner level, when Congress says "partnership

14

item," that's significant.

15

It ­­ it adds defined terms of

16

"non­partnership item" or "affected item."

17

"partnership item."

18

excluded non­partnership affected items here, and that's

19

the way to read it.

It said

So we think that it necessarily

20

And second, if you read the "relates to" as

21

broadly as the government says, then it makes no sense.

22

The partnership item here might as well say "affected

23

item" because you're right, at some level of

24

abstraction, you can always say that the penalty relates

25

to the partnership item.

11

That is everything that we think the court

can do under the statutory provision we just referred

to, to determine the applicability of that penalty

14

because it relates to a partnership item, the

15

partnership's statement of its income or basis on the

23

MR. GARRE:

Right.

And the reason why ­­

24

and I think that gets back to partnership item because,

25

if you read "relates to" in the broad sense that the

35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

government is asking you to read it, then, in essence,

2

you are adding ­­ you're taking away the limitation of

3

"partnership item," and you are adding words that says

4

"or affected item," because what they're saying is,

5

look, anytime you have a partnership item that is in any

6

way related to the imposition of a penalty down the

7

road, then you can do it.

8

But another way of saying that, and the way

9

that Congress would have said if it meant it was,

10

courts, you can determine the applicability of any

11

penalty that relates to a partnership item or an

12

affected item.

13

But Congress didn't say that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it is in addition to

14

partnership item.

15

because it would add to partnership items.

18

Our point is the one that the

non­partnership item, and this grant of jurisdiction ­­

We would, Your Honor.

consequences of this ruling.

wants to do is funnel all of these penalty determinations

21

into a computational adjustment, as opposed to the

statute, Section 6230.

It's very significant from

has huge consequence.

It means that the taxpayers have

I mean, it's sort of

obvious, just as it's obvious that, if a partnership

item has a miscalculation that the partner is going to

21

include it in their tax return later.

22

permit the penalty to be imposed up front and to pay the

23

tax up front because you're making an assumption that

24

it's been included erroneously on the partner level.

25

MR. GARRE:

That's why we

And I think what you would

be doing is assuming a fact necessary to the penalty,

2

that outside basis was reported as zero, for purposes of

3

finding jurisdiction, and we don't think the court could

do that.

5

The government acknowledges that it ­­ that

it's at least possible that the taxpayer, in a fit of

7

conscience or having fully ­­ more fully understood the

8

transactions, would not inflate its basis, it would

Sometimes, transactions are shams; sometimes,

And yet, if you have a situation where you

Couldn't the government

government simply have said that the partnership

overstated its basis?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, I have a second

question, which I asked your friend as well.

this to be a sham or not to be a sham?

Is he

No, no, Your Honor, in this

sense, if this Court resolves the merits question, then

that ­­ that ruling whether the penalty applies or not

Well, but why ­­ why

wouldn't ­­ couldn't one court say I don't think it's a

sham partnership?

MR. GARRE:

Well, that determination, Your

5

Honor, is being made at the partnership level, and we

6

agree that it can be made at that level, and that

7

determination applies to all the partners.

8

inconsistency about that.

There is no

11

of the ­­ the basis misstatement penalty as the

jurisdiction to do that because it depends on that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think that ­­

say that that's not true because individual partners may

respond differently to the partnership determination

with respect to basis.

20

MR. GARRE:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
Some of them are

22

going to put in something else, but somebody may put in

zero for a number of the reasons that the IRS's counsel

24

suggested.

25

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And now, I suspect

2

that those will be only in rare circumstances, and I

3

guess that's why the D.C. Circuit said, even though the

4

result here may be obvious, it nonetheless depends on

5

the outside basis determination.

6

MR. GARRE:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Exactly.
And I think what I

8

understand your friend to be saying is it's not just

9

that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore,

10

it doesn't depend on the outside partnership

11

determinations.

12

So does your case hinge on the perhaps

13

unusual situations where you have one of these partners

14

having a fit of conscience and decides to put down the

15

real number or has some other adjustment to it?

MR. GARRE:

if I can explain that.

18

low­hanging fruit situation the D.C. Circuit resolved.

it's low hanging, you're forbidden to pick it.

I ­­ I think largely, yes, but
First, that presents the

Second, here, the whole partnership is

shammed, but there's certainly cases where individual

transactions are shammed.

transactions are shammed, then the ­­ the outside basis

25

can vary widely based on the individual circumstances of

the partners.

2

And so there, in that situation, it's not at

3

all obvious or ­­ or necessarily true that the basis is

4

going to be overstated.

5

that's why it's a completely separate

6

determination made ­­ partner level.

You have to look.

you're talking about.

10

MR. GARRE:

Because I'm not quite sure about what

Well, you could have a

11

partnership, Your Honor, that engages in many

12

transactions.

13

the many transactions that it entered into was a sham.

14

That particular transaction was only designed for tax

15

purposes, but other transactions that it engaged in were

16

legitimate.

17

And the IRS would determine that one of

21

outside basis, they may have ­­ they may have tried to

22

take advantage of the sham transaction, but yet, all the

23

other transactions affect their basis as well in the

24

partnership.

25

In that case, the individual partners'

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm ­­ I'm a little

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

confused on this example.

2

carried forward, which we're assuming they would have

3

done, carried forward the outside basis, the penalty

4

would have been determined just on that one transaction.

5

MR. GARRE:

Presumably, it's only if they

No, because, Your Honor, again,

6

the penalty is based on what the individual partner

7

claims as his basis, and that partner is going to be

8

looking to everything that goes into his partnership

9

interest, the costs or investment in the partnership,

10

pertaining not only to the one transaction that we have

11

hypothesized has been shammed, but many other

12

transactions as well.

13

So you ­­ you can't conclude either that

14

there's been any misstatement or that any misstatement

15

triggers the valuation misstatement penalty here.

16

If I could talk a little bit about the

17

merits, on the merits, our fundamental question is that

18

the valuation misstatement penalty that Congress devised

19

in 1981 was not intended at all to apply to the

20

fundamentally different situation here where the

21

government is claiming not that you misstated the

22

correct amount of the value or that you didn't have an

23

accurate amount of the value or the number that you put

24

for basis or value, but that the thing that's the

25

subject of the valuation or the basis doesn't exist at

I mean, we know if you look at the ­­ the

12

And they wrote words that seem to be

13

applicable to this case, as well as to the kind of case

14

that you're talking about.

15

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, they have basis, and

we have context, punctuation, pre­enactment history,

post­enactment history, and structure.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GARRE:

No, not at all, Your Honor,

22

because this is a valuation misstatement penalty.

23

reference to "or adjusted basis" comes in a

24

parenthetical, subordinate way.

25

And let me give you a hypothetical.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

The

One of

Official

2

3

flowers or plants in parentheses, you would ­­ you would

4

5

lilies or ferns that would accompany flowers in the

6

wedding.

If

You wouldn't read that to include an oak tree

8

Well, the government’s basis overstatement

9

penalty is the oak tree in the middle of the reception

10

area here.

11

misstatements are made, the government acknowledges

12

throughout its brief, is where you misstate the price or

13

cost of a good.

14

which is why the reference to adjusted basis makes sense

15

in the statutory scheme here.

16

The most common situation in which basis

And yet, they're moving ­­ which is ­­

It covers that situation.

But ­­ but they're saying, you don't need

17

to ­­ it goes far beyond that, not only to the prosaic

18

situation as they call it, but to a situation where

19

you're not complaining about whether the thing ­­ what

20

the correct number is or what the correct amount is.

21

You're saying the thing doesn't exist at all.

22

I mean, if I donate a painting that I say is

23

worth $1 million to a church, and I put that on my

24

return, but, in fact, it turns out that I didn't donate

25

the painting, I may have committed a fraud.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

I may have

Official

1

lied about contributing the painting, but I haven't made

2

a valuation misstatement, nor have I misstated my basis.

3

And I think our ­­ our position is here

4

that, if you look at everything, as I mentioned, the

5

words of the statute, the context in which a basis is ­­

6

appears, the structure, there's a graduated scheme that

7

makes no sense with a zero basis situation, which is

8

essentially a nullity.

9

If you look at the fact that Congress

10

addressed this in 2010, not by amending the valuation

11

misstatement penalty, but by enacting a penalty designed

12

to apply to this situation, the noneconomic transaction

13

situation.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So just to be clear, if

15

this is ­­ 6 had been on the books, then you would have

16

no quarrel with the government’s position, they could do

this at the partnership level and ­­

That's the way

If ­­ if what was ­­
MR. GARRE:

If the noneconomic substance

23

transaction penalty that was enacted in 2010 was on the

25

applicability of that penalty, which is based on what

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the partnership did at the partnership proceeding, and

2

we would agree that penalty applies.

3

All the problems are solved by what Congress

4

did to address this particular situation.

5

government is trying to put that square peg in a round

6

hole.

7

The

And if you add everything up, I think

8

what's ­­ what's interesting about the government’s

9

reply brief is it doesn't contest that ­­ that if

10

there's any ambiguity here, the statute has to be read

11

in favor of the taxpayer.

12

canon that this Court has recognized that tax penalties

13

are strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer.

14

And that's because of the

Here, at a bare minimum, there is ambiguity

15

as to whether the Congress that passed the valuation

16

misstatement penalty ever intended it to apply to this

17

fundamentally different situation where no one disagrees

18

about the numbers reported on the return.

19

Again, if you go to the partnership return,

20

the transactions are accurately reported.

21

the outside basis, it's true that they reported a loss,

22

but that's because they were following the IRS' rules

23

about how you treat contingent liabilities.

24

number is actually accurate under the IRS' rules.

25

If you go to

So that

That's why the IRS has to come up with a

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sham to get rid of the property altogether and say that

2

we are going to pretend that it doesn't exist at all.

3

But, again, that's not a valuation

4

misstatement.

5

amounts, about accuracy, about value, it's trying to get

6

at the number that the thing is worth.

7

concerned with a situation in which the IRS is claiming

8

that the property doesn't exist at all.

9

When the penalty talks about correct

It is not

That ­­ that is a different problem.

10

Congress addressed it in a direct way, in a noneconomic

11

substance penalty.

12

about this problem being unaddressed.

13

So this Court doesn't have to worry

But what it should do is correctly interpret

14

the penalty that Congress enacted, which was on the

15

books when these events occurred, which is the valuation

16

misstatement penalty it is not the all­encompassing basis

17

overstatement penalty.

18

I think, if you're going to read one of the

19

amicus briefs, read the Shakow amicus brief.

How does it not?

"Partnership items" is defined to include legal and

10

factual determinations that underlie the determination,

11

Whether there is a partnership at all

19

situation because the IRS did not determine that the

20

underlying transactions, the purchases and sale of

determined that the partnerships were shams.

was, because there were no partnerships, the

9

transactions should be treated as though they had ­­

10
11
12
13

were engaged in by the individual partners.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Maybe it was a frame with

a blank canvas.
MR. STEWART:

Well ­­ and I ­­ and I think,

14

as ­­ as I was starting to say at the close of my

15

opening argument, it's no accident that partnerships

16

were used to effectuate this scheme because, if the

17

individuals had bought and sold the offsetting foreign

18

currency options, they would have had no colorable

19

rationale for contending that they were entitled to a

20

deduction for the cost of the long option, but they were

21

not required to treat as income the amount they received

22

from the short option.

23

It would have been absolutely clear that the

24

transaction, taken as a whole, was a wash.

25

that they could try to create the appearance of a paper

55

The only way

Official

1

loss was by manipulating the rules that govern the

2

computation of basis in partnerships.

3

shamming determination, in effect, was a determination

4

that, for tax purposes, you can't try to take advantage

5

of the Helmer rule that says that, for computing basis

6

in a partnership, we will ignore the ­­ the contingent

7

liability created by the short option.

And so the

8

The ­­ the one thing ­­ other thing I would

9

say on the merits as to why we care about this case is

10

that Respondent's argument doesn't just go to ­­ on ­­

11

on Subsection 3, doesn't just go to basis overstatements

12

that are produced through sham transactions.

13

all basis overstatements that are produced through legal

14

errors.

15

It goes to

And I think that ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you ­­ do you

16

agree that the new legislation completely resolves this

17

problem?

18

MR. STEWART:

It completely resolves the

19

specific problem posed by this ­­ almost completely

20

resolves the specific problem.

21

Subsection 6 undoubtedly would cover this

22

case.

23

40 percent penalty, rather than a 20 percent penalty is

24

slightly different.

25

you disclose the relevant information on your tax

Now, Subsection 6, the trigger for having a

return, then even if it's later determined that the

2

transaction lacked economic substance, you would be

3

subject only to the 20 percent penalty.

4

Under Subsection 3, you can get the

5

40 percent if the overstatement is 400 percent or more

6

regardless of disclosure.

7

covers it.

But other ­­ other ­­

that they are bound in a partner­level proceeding to the

MR. STEWART:

Because he says

With respect to jurisdiction,

16

the question simply goes to the allocation of

17

responsibilities between the partnership­level court and

18

the partner­level court.

19

Now, when he says we are trying to avoid

20

deficiency proceedings, I ­­ I think it ignores the fact

21

that, under our reading, the important legal objections

22

that Respondent has made to the penalty, namely the arguments

23

that are set forth in Part 2 of their brief, can resolve –

24

under our theory, can be resolved at the partnership level

25

without prepayment of penalties.
