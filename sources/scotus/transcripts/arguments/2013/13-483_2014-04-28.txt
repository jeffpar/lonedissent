CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Mr. Singh?

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. SINGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner, Mr. Edward Lane, alleges that

11

Respondent, Steve Franks, fired him in retaliation for

12

his testimony before a Federal grand jury in district

13

court on a matter that is undisputedly a public concern,

14

the misconduct of a State legislator.

15

Petitioner testified about events that he

16

learned while working, but the testimony itself was not

17

a part of his job responsibilities.

18

This Court should hold that Petitioner's

19

testimony implicates the First Amendment because he

20

spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.

21

should further hold that this was clearly established in

22

2009 when Respondent Franks fired him.

23

It

Those fold ­­ holdings follow from a long

24

line of this Court's precedents, which establishes that

25

the First Amendment applies to all public employee

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

speech on matters of public concern, except when the

2

employee speaks pursuant to his official duties.

3

The remainder of the case, including the

4

application of the Pickering balancing test and

5

Respondent's other defenses can all be addressed on

6

remand.

7

This Court can also leave for another day

8

the question of whether a public employee who testifies

9

in court but pursuant to his official responsibilities

10
11

would be protected.
The way the case has shaken out in the

12

briefing, the principal point of contention has become

13

whether the fact that Petitioner learned the facts about

14

which he testified at work is sufficient to deprive his

15

testimony of protection.

16

But for decades ­­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it ­­ what if the

18

person who testified had the definite job responsibility

19

of investigating possible corruption in the agency?

20

Suppose that that person was something like an Inspector

21

General.

22

MR. SINGH:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

If ­­
When would the testimony

be ­­ be within the scope of the person's job duties?
MR. SINGH:

I think it would depend on the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

circumstances of the particular case.
And that would be the exact next question,

3

because the responsibility to investigate by itself does

4

not necessarily also include the responsibility to

5

testify.

6

where there is an internal investigator whose job is to

7

deal with issues internally and that wouldn't be covered

8

by job responsibilities.

9

in which that investigator also regularly testifies.

10

In this case, there is no dispute that my

And so in certain cases you could imagine

But there may be other cases

11

client's responsibility was to manage the staff of his

12

department and therefore to deal with issues that arose.

13

But there is also no dispute that he was never expected

14

to testify in court and that this testimony was all the

15

result of a subpoena issued by a Federal court in

16

response to a request from Federal prosecutors.

17

I think that that is the ­­ that case gets us towards

18

the harder question that this Court doesn't have to

19

decide in this case.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so

Well, just to follow up on

21

that, could there be ever a situation in which a

22

government employee's testimony is within the scope of

23

that employee's duties if the employee is not ­­ does

24

not testify on behalf of his employer?

25

MR. SINGH:

I think that there is ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the employee is

2

subpoenaed by ­­ by the opposite side, then you would

3

say that's enough, that makes the testimony outside the

4

scope of the employee's responsibilities?

5

MR. SINGH:

I think that would be strong

6

evidence.

7

articulated the scope of an employee's duties and the

8

determination of whether an employee is acting in the

9

scope of those duties is a practical inquiry, and so it

In Garcetti v. Ceballos this Court

10

would vary considerably case to case.

11

of a subpoena is strong evidence that when an employee

12

testifies he is not doing so because it's his job to do

13

so.

14

But again, that's really just one ­­

15

I think the fact

MR. SINGH:

Your Honor, in those cases I

23

think there would be an argument that in every case they

24

are acting in the scope of their duties if you consider

25

the practical circumstances that give rise to that

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

testimony.

2

sort of the strong version of the First Amendment, the

3

argument that we make ­­ this is not the rule that we

4

are asking for, but this is the rule that's asked for by

5

the ACLU, by a couple of the other amici.

6

But there is also an argument, and this is

The strong version of the First Amendment

7

argument is that even in those circumstances there is a

8

separate and a superior obligation to testify truthfully

9

to the court, that is, to provide information in a way

10

that is unbiased toward the interests of the employer.

11

And recognizing First Amendment protection furthers that

12

interest because it frees the employee to testify

13

candidly and completely.

14

word "immunity" ­­

15

And, Your Honor mentioned the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens in a

16

situation where a police officer gets on the stand and

17

in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to

18

­­ or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed

19

in a clown suit?

20

MR. SINGH:

Could the employer fire him then?
I think the answer is almost

21

certainly yes, and that occurs through the application

22

of the Pickering balancing test.

23

Amendment protection for employee speech has worked

24

since the 1960s is that when speech relates to a matter

25

of public concern, the speech ­­ the First Amendment

The way that First

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

applies.

2

The next question, which is whether the

3

employer discipline is nevertheless permitted, is a

4

function of a balancing of the employee's interest in

5

speaking and society's interest in hearing the speech

6

versus the employer's interest in effectively and

7

efficiently providing public services.

8

In the case of the clown suit, in the case

9

of testimony that's unprepared, reflects badly on the

10

department, all of those are justifications that any

11

employer can use to argue that, even though the First

12

Amendment applies, discipline is nevertheless warranted.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any ­­ would

there be any Pickering balancing in this case?

15

MR. SINGH:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If this Court ­­
If the Court says that

17

speech is protected, would there be any need to go on

18

these facts into a Pickering balance?

19

MR. SINGH:

Your Honor, we don't believe

20

that in the summary judgment record there is any

21

evidence that my client's speech was at all disruptive,

22

and that's why the United States has argued that if you

23

perform the balancing test here yourself you can find in

24

our favor.

25

that question.

Nevertheless, we think it's okay to remand
We haven't briefed it.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

We haven't asked

Official

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we are asked to

3

decide the qualified immunity and how can we find there

4

is no qualified immunity in view of the Morris v. Crow

5

decision?

6

MR. SINGH:

We think the Morris decision is

7

plainly distinguishable.

8

we would raise against that decision.

9

this is a point that's been made by not only us but also

10

the United States and the Alabama attorney general, that

11

Morris is flatly contrary to this Court's precedents.

12

All of the emphasis in Morris on whether the employee

13

was intending to speak out on a matter of public concern

14

finds no support in the way this Court has applied the

15

rules relating to public employee speech.

16

There are a few arguments that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The first is, and

But ­­

That means the Eleventh

17

Circuit is wrong.

18

because they were following circuit bad precedent?

19

Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter under our

jurisprudence.

21

MR. SINGH:

Should the employee be victimized

Your Honor, I would be willing

22

to concede, if the case were clearly on point, that

qualified immunity should perhaps nevertheless apply.

think it's highly questionable, but it's an open

25

question and I would be willing to concede that.

that speech, certainly in the Hustler, Falwell v.

was just because the facts came from your employment.

If you're conducting an investigation and you find out

14

would suggest something close to the Pickering fact

understand what you're saying.

that, no matter what the employee's official duties are,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH.

16
17

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SINGH:

Thank you.

I'd like to begin,

18

if I might, by just talking about the subject of

19

qualified immunity and the import of the Eleventh

20

Circuit and what it did and didn't decide.

21

The Eleventh Circuit clearly has decided

22

that in 2009, when Petitioner was fired, the law has not

23

clearly established a right to testify in the Eleventh

24

Circuit.

25

there is no point to remanding it.

That was decided in this case and so I think

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Nothing about this

Official

1

Court's decision in 2014 is going to change the Eleventh

2

Circuit's belief about what the law was in 2009.

3

I think you should decide the question.

4

I think it's very telling that both of the sovereigns in

5

this case say that we win under a straightforward

6

application of Garcetti cited in 2006.

7

Respondent Burrow's brief and repeatedly she urges,

8

don't make a new rule of law; just apply the rule of law

9

you had in Garcetti.

And so

On that issue,

You look at

precedent that governs in this situation unless you're

21

look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion and say, I know

22

that's what it says, but it's wrong.

23

MR. SINGH:

Your Honor, I think if Supreme

24

Court precedent is clear, then contrary to Eleventh

25

Circuit precedent shouldn't be controlling and employees

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

shouldn't be entitled to rely on it, and that's

2

certainly the implication of what this Court said in

3

Hope v. Pelzer.

4

that the defendants made was that there were a variety

5

of district court decisions that supported their view of

6

the law.

7

judicial precedent is a function of the judicial

8

hierarchy.

In Hope v. Pelzer, one of the arguments

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're requiring

12

the government employee in this case to be a better

13

analyzer of Supreme Court precedent than the three

14

Eleventh Circuit judges.

15

MR. SINGH:

Your Honor, I think that that is

16

not what we're requiring, because our argument in this

17

case is supplemented by what I think is an equally

18

strong argument that Eleventh Circuit precedent really

19

did not support this outcome, that the Court went very,

20

very far out on a limb in this case.

21

And I might just talk about the one case

22

that the Solicitor General mentioned, the Green v.

23

Barrett case.

24

2007 in which the chief jailer of a jail attended a

25

hearing at a court, and it's not even 100 percent clear

6

It was an emergency

And she

There is no indication that it was even a

sort of judicial proceedings we're talking about here.

9

And I think when you compare that case, again, to the

There's no indication that it was the

10

precedential decision in Martinez in 1992, no one could

11

have looked at those cases and come to the conclusion

12

that it's really a good idea for a State employer to

13

fire a Federal witness in retaliation for their truthful

14

testimony.

15

That's the conclusion that Franks would have

16

had to be able to reach in 2009.
