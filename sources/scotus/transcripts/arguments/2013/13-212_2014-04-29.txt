ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The facts of this case, United States v.

12

Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule that

13

would preclude searches of cell phones incident to

14

arrest would be inconsistent with historical practice

15

and detrimental to law enforcement.

16

This is a case where what the officers did

17

was see a phone ringing.

18

caller was identified as "my house."

19

opened up the phone, pressed one button to see that the

20

call came in from "my house" and pressed another to see

21

what the phone number was.

22

On the outside screen, the
The officers

That's all they did.

That kind of a search serves valid,

23

time­honored functions in the search situation of

24

helping to ascertain the identity of the offender.

25

was a crucial fact because a few minutes later, Wurie

Alderson Reporting Company

This

lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the

2

police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his

3

house.

4

be able to ­­

5

They didn't know where he was.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They would not

I'm not ­­ I'm not

6

sure.

7

a warrant, and once he lied about his arrest, they would

8

have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten

9

a warrant.

10

If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Sotomayor, you could

11

almost always say in search­incident­to­arrest cases

12

that the police could have gotten a warrant.

13

I'm not talking about cases where somebody is carrying a

14

gun and the police take the gun off them and ­­ and they

15

secure it that way.

16

you could imagine that involve searches for evidence,

17

letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds,

18

which have been discussed here, once the officer has it,

19

you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in

20

it because that could be done under a warrant.

21

no time constraint.

22

constraint.

23

It's ­­

But in all of the other cases that

There's

There's no destruction of evidence

Here, in fact, there actually is a

24

destruction­of­evidence threat with respect to the

25

general category of cell phones, and that's what this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

Court has been asked to look at, the general category,

2

cell phones and smartphones.

3

We discussed earlier the threat of remote

4

wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter

5

to that.

6

more critical to law enforcement today, and that is

7

encryption.

8

encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for

9

a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if

There is the other threat that I think is even

Because if the phone turns off and becomes

10

they can break through the encryption and actually

11

obtain the evidence.

12

So to the extent that the traditional

13

destruction­of­evidence rationale justified the search

14

of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional

15

items, it applies even more strongly with respect to

16

cell phones than it does with most of the items that

17

might be seized from a person.

18

So Wurie, I think ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please tell me about

20

encryption, because I know people can encrypt, but I

21

thought they had to do that when they put the

22

information in the phone.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

As best I understand it,

24

Justice Sotomayor, many smartphones today are equipped

25

with built­in encryption.

Apple has hardware encryption

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

and software encryption.

2

brands are quickly following with strong encryption.

3

The encryption is deployed in a way that if you don't

4

have the key, the data that's on the phone is useless.

5

The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible

6

only when you can get into the phone.

7

Samsung and HTC and other

Now, if the phone is on and functioning

8

because the person has been arrested while they are, for

9

example, making a phone call, you can get access to the

10

phone and you can attempt to get information from the

11

phone without the encryption key being an obstacle.

12

if the encryption is deployed, that can sometimes be an

13

insuperable barrier even to the manufacturer.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

I'm not sure how on the

15

scene the police are going to look at everything in a

16

cell phone anyway.

17

save it.

18

They've got to be doing something to

If the encryption can be ­­

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, no.

The ­­ the evidence

19

is ­­ the information on the phone is encrypted ­­ this

20

is my understanding, Justice Sotomayor ­­ but the phone

21

itself has the key to decrypt it because the user

22

obviously wants to get access to the information.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, you have a problem.

24

Apparently, neither you nor I actually have this on

25

their phone, as far as I know.

So I'm imagining

system that once it goes "bzzz," you never can get the

time to look at it.

keep the police away wouldn't do it after 30 seconds.

14

Well, why wouldn't ­­ you see I'm similarly

I don't either because I

MR. DREEBEN:

It's encrypted.

And that's

21

the problem.

22

and I think this is something also revealing about ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

My point is, somebody who

really wants to go to all that trouble will surely have

MR. DREEBEN:

A lot of these searches occur,

2

Justice Sotomayor, at the side of the road where the

3

officer opens ­­ in the Riley case, the officer opened

4

the phone right on the heels of the arrest and he

5

immediately saw evidence that the individual was a gang

6

member, something that he hadn't had personal knowledge

7

of before, because every letter K was preceded by a C,

8

which indicated to him it meant Crip killer, which

9

indicated he was a member of the Bloods gang.

So it's a

10

very common thing for officers to take advantage of the

11

information that's on a phone just the way that they

12

would take advantage of the information that's on a

13

person to find out who they are dealing with.

14

And I think it was asked in the Riley

15

argument whether there were instances in which phones

16

have been used to trigger dangers.

17

instances in which people have used their cell phones

18

right before an arrest to call in a posse of their

19

accomplices to basically attack the police.

20

looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to

21

the ­­ to the officers, they can look quickly and see if

22

there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a

23

phone call that might actually protect their safety,

24

which is another one of the traditional justifications

25

of search incident to arrest.

Alderson Reporting Company

And there are

And by

This is a categorical exception, as the

2

Court recognized twice last term, both in Maryland v.

King decision and in the McNeely decision, the Court

4

recognized that search­incident­to­arrest was a

5

categorical exception to the normal warrant requirement.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I would not

12

be able to answer a question about what condition most

13

cell phones are found in.

14

arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates

15

that at least in a significant number of cases, the

16

phones are not locked and the officers are able to

17

obtain access to the information.

The fact that this issue has

18

Now, if they are not able to obtain access

19

to the information, I want to tie this back to things

20

that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were

21

concerned about the possibility for police searching too

22

much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the

23

crime for which the person is arrested or his identity.

24
25

Now, we talked earlier about the crime of
arrest limitation, which I think would screen out a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

great many, not all, minor crimes.

2

least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about

3

exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home,

4

distinguished between serious and minor crimes.

5

another possible line that the Court could explore.

6

not as much in favor of that one because I do think that

7

the officers have an interest in determining, no matter

8

who they have arrested, who that person is, because the

9

person could pose an unknown threat even if they are

to do that.

15

if the search of that forensic database was going to go

be that in the future more information will migrate to

15

what the officers can actually do.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We do not

But I thought the whole

17

ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so,

18

was that even the user doesn't know what what's on the

19

20

MR. DREEBEN:

So to the extent that that is

21

true, Justice Kagan, law enforcement officers, to ensure

22

they're complying with the Fourth Amendment, would have

Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting

principle in this case.

Justice

From your argument, you

Do you have

15
1

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do.

2

The first one that I think has been discussed in both

3

arguments and Justice Scalia has brought it up as well,

4

is that the evidence to be searched, unless there's some

5

exigency, should be relevant to the crime of arrest and

6

the Court can articulate that in a way that would

7

prevent roving searches or speculative searches.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that ­­ that was for

an expired license.
MR. DREEBEN:

necessarily ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

­­ or is it the guns that

were under the hood in the other case?
MR. DREEBEN:

In the Riley case, the guns

15

were under the hood and the arresting officers found a

green bandana and some red and white Converse shoes, I

17

believe.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The crime of arrest was

the expired license.
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

The crime of arrest was

the firearms in Riley.

It was only after they found ­­

That's correct, after the

MR. DREEBEN:

­­ the firearms in the impound

Alderson Reporting Company

And at

Official

16
1

that point the ultimate search that occurred was because

2

there was a known propensity of gang members to document

3

their use of firearms in pictures.

4

the arresting officer was looking for.

5

different than what he would have looked for on the

6

arrestee's person in his wallet.

7

of cloud­based search, search into health records.

8

was a scope­focused search.

9

And so that's what
It's no

So it wasn't the kind
It

So I think that there are limiting

10

principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to.

11

is when the officer is looking for crime of

12

arrest­related material and there is evidence that can

13

be plausibly said is crime of arrest­related material on

14

the phone, he can look for that.

15

One

The Court could couple that, if it wasn't

16

satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a

17

scope­based limit which would say that you can't look

18

everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic

19

chance that there's going to be evidence related to the

20

crime of arrest.

21

You need to keep a scope focus.

22

23

assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression.

And the police would have to conform their conduct to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. DREEBEN:

What would the scope

It would depend on the crime.

So if you were looking for evidence related to the crime

7

of possession of child pornography, you could certainly

8

go through photographs.

9

crime, potentially drug trafficking, you would look for

If you were looking for another

10

things like drug ledgers, recent contacts, lists of

11

customers and not necessarily in videos.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's very hard to

13

see how that limit would be applied.

14

the police would be able to articulate why almost every

15

application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably

16

be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime.

17

Obviously e­mails, obviously call logs.

18

Facebook.

19

pictures of themselves with guns.

20

trouble imagining what application, what entry police

21

could not say it's reasonably likely that there would be

22

evidence of the crime.

23

You can look

You can see and

Even, you know,

I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, I have

So, Mr. Chief Justice, to the

24

extent that you think that's an inevitable

25

generalization and there is a certain way of looking at

it in which that's correct, then the interposition of a

2

warrant requirement would do nothing because the warrant

3

would say, search the cell phone for evidence related to

4

drug trafficking and then the phone would be searched in

5

exactly that manner.

6

JUSTICE BREYER: No, the point of a warrant is

7

that a person who is not involved and is objective

8

listens to what the policeman is saying, knowing that

9

sometimes, like me or any other human being, a policeman

10

can get a little carried away.

11

show the warrant, that there is this basis, you issue

12

the warrant.

13

It isn't because they're different legal questions.

14

It's just you want that third dispassionate mind to

15

review what the facts are.

16

So if, in fact, he does

Many, many ­­ and if he doesn't you don't.

Now, if that's a purpose of having a

warrant, how long does it take to get a warrant in the

question I'm trying to get to is this.

you've said is the harm in saying, yes, you need a

6

So where is someone ­­ the bell rings on the phone.

Depending on the kind of crime, it may be pretty

important to let the policeman answer to find out where

it's coming from, because it may be other people on the

But you don't need a special rule other than the rule,

18

If your view of the technology is right,

How will that hurt?

MR. DREEBEN:

That is a special rule for the

19

search­incident­to­arrest content.

20

discussed a variety of special rules, but that rule

21

completely compromises the interests in search­incident­to­arrest,

22

because they have always assumed that the

23

interest in police discovering evidence that could help

24

them in the prosecution, that could protect their

25

safety, and that would avoid destruction is paramount

It's ­­ we've

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

hope that I can make this clearer, because the encryption

problem is what makes it impossible for the police to be

8

confident that you can take the time to go and get a

9

warrant and you won't lose the data forever.

Encryption

10

kicks in when the phone is turned to a setting that

know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice

15

Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless

16

it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know

17

whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless

18

you do that, then you are basically putting the officers

19

at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be

able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of

routine searches that they have always conducted in the

MR. DREEBEN:

And they will leapfrog each other at

10

where those people who want to protect against

11

revelation of data on the phone will succeed.

12

And my only point here is that it would not

13

be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on

14

today's technology and reasonable projections of

15

technology, that the police will just easily be able to

16

go and get a warrant, because my experience from the

17

people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones

18

are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state

19

and it's very tough to deal with that.

20

does have concerns, as many members of the Court have

21

expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the

22

traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and

these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to

the facts of the cases.

5

preserve some areas for protection, we've talked about

6

limiting the justification for a search, limiting the

7

scope of a search, limiting the duration of a search,

9

to what can be found manually on the phone.

But if the Court is looking to

was trying to do with the word "exigency?"

to figure out if that's a way of dealing with the

13

14

technology is such that the policeman, it's really true

15

if he has five minutes to search, he can get this

16

valuable evidence and if the technology is such that it

17

doesn't even give him five minutes, or if it's such that

18

it gives him four or five hours, or if it's such that he

19

can press a button, or if it's the opposite and they can

just cough and encrypt it, well, all that will be fed

21

into the word "exigency," which we wouldn't have to

decide now, but rather, you could make your arguments

in this case than the police looking at your driver's

license when you're carrying it around in your wallet.

So the problem here

7

was that he called ­­ he indicated that a number was his

9

MS. MIZNER:

The problem is that the police

searched his phone in order to associate information

3

MS. MIZNER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

So ­­
I mean, if, in fact, you

5

can search the phone thoroughly for everything in the

6

person's life, they might have come up with something

7

when he was six years old, there is, in fact, a picture

8

of an elephant at the zoo.

Totally public.

9

But it would still fall within the rule,

10

which what I thought one of the things we're arguing

11

about in this case.

12

MS. MIZNER:

Yes, Justice Breyer, and we

believe that the seize­and­secure rule that we are

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well, what is

17

your argument for the proposition, look, when you search

a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly

19

public information; sometimes what you come up with is

20

private information.

21

rule should be no.

Now, you want to say the absolute

22

But what's your argument, rather than trying

23

to say sometimes if you get the private information, no;

24

but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera?

25

MS. MIZNER:

Because everything is so

intermingled on a cell phone or a tablet or a computer,

2

you don't know what you're going to be getting when you

JUSTICE ALITO:

In determining whether the

doing?

of privacy of a ­­ of a person in 2014 who has a cell

legislating what we think is a good privacy rule?

13

MS. MIZNER:

Or are we

I think the Court is

14

determining whether or not in 2014 an individual has a

15

reasonable expectation of privacy against government

16

intrusion into a device that carries around an

17

increasingly large percentage of somebody's personal and

18

private information.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Well, a lot of

20

that ­­ part of that is the person must act ­­ people

21

must actually have that expectation.

22

expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think

23

that everything that's on their cell phones is private,

24

or they think some of the information on the cell phones

25

is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is

Alderson Reporting Company

That must be the

Official

40
1

private.

2

that question about what people in 2014 think about that

3

question?

4

Where do you think we should look to answer

MS. MIZNER:

I think from the fact that

5

people carry them with them in ­­ in a pocket or in a

6

purse, that that exhibits an expectation of privacy.

7

You don't expect people to be rummaging through your

8

pockets or ­­ or through the items you're carrying.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why is that so?

Cell

10

phones are different.

11

suggest for a second that there are like things that

existed in the pre­digital area.

era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable

MS. MIZNER:

Because of the

a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in this

app, but not that app, because you don't know what is

preference is for a warrant to be obtained, and under

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and that's the ­­

test, and we suggest that ­­ that balance here supports

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A search incident to arrest has always been

7

considered a reasonable search within the meaning of the

Fourth Amendment, and I think this case illustrates why

9

that principle well applies to a cell phone.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is a very big

11

confusion of the Fourth Amendment.

doesn't permit reasonable searches without a warrant.

the textual prohibition.

This Court has created

4

language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in

5

certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in

McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search

7

incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception

There was nothing about this

To the extent that the data was not in a

call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of

privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I

think that underscores why the search was limited and

22

reasonable.

23

why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this

case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this
