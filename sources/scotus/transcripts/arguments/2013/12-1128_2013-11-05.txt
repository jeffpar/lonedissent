ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Patent law places the burden of proving

12

infringement on the patentee.

13

was settled that the burden does not shift if the issue

14

arises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment of

15

non­infringement.

17

the party seeking a declaration of non­infringement is a

18

licensee.

19

And until this case, it

The Federal circuit imposed a

That was error.

Allocation of the burden of proof inheres in

20

the governing substantive law, while the Declaratory

21

Judgment Act is procedural only and does not change

22

substantive rights.

23

actions, like all other declaratory actions, remains

24

where it would have rested in the equivalent coercive

25

suit brought by that patentee.

The burden of proof in MedImmune

out, that the word "burden of proof" ­­ I think the word

make rules about ordering ­­ the ordering of proof in

12

patent cases.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if that's all that's

14

involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite

15

as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it?

16

If ­­ suppose the ­­ the patentee has the burden of

17

production, so they would have to explain why there was

18

infringement; they would have to introduce proof of

19

infringement.

20

And the only difference is who wins when

21

the ­­ the factfinder thinks that it is exactly in

22

equipoise.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

Well, that, of course,

24

was not what happened in ­­ not what the Respondent

25

maintained should happen in this case.

the substantive ­­ the ­­ the reason why the Federal

10

circuit erred is clearly doctrinal, which is this Court

11

12

like standards of proof, are substantive.

13

in the substantive right, and the Court has also said,

14

repeatedly, that the declaratory judgment action is

15

procedural only and doesn't change substantive rights.

16

But I think if you go to a ­­ to the policy

21

coercive action would be resolved without the ­­ without

itself to retrospective liability.

proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action

12

under the Act is not ­­ is aimed not to change any

substantive rights.

14

cases in this area, except for the one below, left the

15

burden exactly where substantive patent law left it.

16

And that's why all of the decided

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does it help your answer

17

or ­­ or does it limit the theory of your case too much

18

to say that, in this case, there is a controversy

19

satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the

20

patentholder gave notice of potential ­­ or of

21

infringement?

22

Am I right about that?

MR. WAXMAN:

You're right about that, and

23

that would be true, Justice Kennedy, on all MedImmune

24

cases.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, could we ­­ or should

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we make the case turn on that, or can we say, with

2

declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we ­­

3

we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the

formality of a notice is not important.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

formality of a notice.

7

Court addressed in MedImmune ­­ the question that you're

8

raising, I think, is one that goes to Article III

9

jurisdiction.

Well, I don't know that it's a

You can't use the declaratory judgment

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it goes to me to ­­

14

case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to

15

know what all these new inventions are?

16

know about it?

17

saying, well, it gave notice of infringement.

18
19
20

When I picked up this

What does it

But then I answered my own question by

But ­­ that's why I've asked if the notice
is essential to your position?
MR. WAXMAN:

I think the notice is the ­­

21

well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune

22

question, whether or not there actually is a case or

23

controversy.

24
25

So, in this case, it's perfectly obvious
because the ­­ the license requires Medtronic to

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affirmatively go to Mirowski within 30 days of

2

introducing any product and not only tell ­­ providing

3

notice of the product, but providing the manual ­­ the

4

diagrams and the manuals that are given to physicians so

5

that Mirowski can determine, within 60 days, whether or

6

not to assert infringement.

7

In MedImmune, you didn't have that

8

procedure, but the Court still held in the context of

9

that case that, because Genentech had made clear that it

10

thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused

11

devices, there was sufficient ­­ sufficiently concrete

12

controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying

13

royalties and breach the license.

14

And ­­ and so, therefore ­­ I think I may be

15

talking around your question, but I am trying to get to

16

the point that the ­­ the requirement of some notice,

17

the ­­ the patentee ­­ there's no declaratory judgment

18

jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the

19

product, has ­­ has never done anything to suggest that

20

the product ­­ that his or her patent reads on the

21

product.

22

But that is an Article III question that

23

would be ­­ you wouldn't get to the burden of proof if

24

you couldn't satisfy MedImmune.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, what do you

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make of the ­­ the patent listing non­infringement as an

2

affirmative defense in an infringement suit?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

We agree with the articulation

4

of the point by the Solicitor General in the United

5

States brief, which is that the cases have recognized

6

that non­infringement can either be a general defense ­­

7

that is, when ­­ when non­infringement is simply a

8

general denial of a cause of ­­ of a claim of

9

infringement, it is not an affirmative defense.

10

But there are particular types of

11

non­infringement claims.

12

with are prosecution history estoppel and the

13

experimental use exception that are affirmative

14

defenses.

15

And the ones that I'm familiar

In other words, those are situations in

16

which the alleged infringer says, hey, I'm not saying

17

that your patent doesn't read ­­ all the claims of your

18

patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming

19

non­infringement because I was making experimental use,

20

and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress

21

not to infringe.

22

Or, yes, your ­­ the elements of your claim

23

read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of

24

the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some

25

claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

this Court elucidated in Festow, there is no

2

infringement.

3

This is a case involving a general denial of

4

infringement, and therefore, it is not an affirmative

5

defense.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What you ­­ what you just

7

responded, that would go as well for an alleged

8

infringer who is not a licensee, right?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

I mean ­­ absolutely.

mean, the point here ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This here ­­ this case is

12

about the difference between the licensee and the

13

non­licensee.

14

I

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

So a defense of

15

non­infringement ­­ a general defense of

16

non­infringement is not an affirmative defense.

17

the ­­ the potential or correlative coercive action

18

which would have been a suit for patent infringement by

19

Mirowski, had we ceased making the royalty payments,

20

they would have borne the burden of proving

21

infringement, unless we raised an affirmative defense,

22

like prosecution history estoppel or experimental use, in which case we

23
24
25

And in

would have the burden.
The point of the Declaratory Judgment Act is
that the burden is left exactly where it would have

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been, had there been no ­­ had this identical issue

2

arisen in the absence of the declaratory judgment

3

procedure.

4

And in this respect, it is identical to the

5

jury trial right, which this Court held in Beacon

6

Theatres v. Westover, is also an element of the

7

substantive claim and also cannot be deprived by the

8

peculiarity of a declaratory judgment being a claim for

9

an equitable remedy.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, as I understand

11

it, the agreement in this case identified certain

12

patents and contemplated that there would be disputes

13

about whether particular products of Medtronic violated

14

or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents.

15
16

But there might be some other kinds of
agreements which, instead, identify certain products ­­

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mm­hmm.
­­ and essentially treat

19

those as infringing products in the absence of a

20

license.

21

same kind of claim, that if Medtronic had that agreement

22

that identified certain products, but Medtronic woke up

23

one day and said, you know what, we don't think that

24

those products infringe, we essentially want to

25

relitigate our agreement, can Medtronic come to court

In that sort of agreement, would you make the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and do that via a declaratory judgment action?

2
3

And if so, who would bear the burden of
proof?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

So if I understand your

5

question, first, to ­­ to go to the license in this

6

case.

7

didn't ­­ that aren't specifically articulated in a

8

license agreement; neither the patents nor the products

9

at issue in this case had even been conceived, much less

This case not only involves products that

10

in existence, at the time the license agreement was in

11

effect.

12

But in ­­ if I understand your question, in

13

a situation in which I make Widget A and you claim that

14

you have the patent that reads on that widget, and I ­­

15

you agree to license me to do it, if the license ­­ if

16

payment of the license depends upon a determination that

17

it otherwise would be infringing, I can file a

18

declaratory judgment action and seek a declaration that

19

it's not infringing.

20

That is, if the cover ­­ if the license

21

covers only products that otherwise would infringe, I

22

can bring a DEC action, claiming non­infringement, and

23

you would bear the burden, assuming that you had

24

threatened, in some way, to enforce your patent against

25

me.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In ­­ in the ­­ the situation that ­­ sort

2

of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the ­­ the

3

intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which ­­

4

imagine, which is you license ­­ I have a ­­ I have a

5

product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I

6

turn around the next day and sue for ­­ a declaration of

7

non­infringement, there are any number of ways that you,

8

as the patentee, could protect yourself from that

9

extraordinary eventuality.

10

You could provide, for example, that ­­ I ­­

11

you would require me to issue a ­­ you know, to ­­ to ­­

12

to pay a paid­up royalty for all use.

13

simply say, we don't care whether the patent infringes

14

or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold.

15

Or you could put a provision in that would say, if you

16

sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to

17

3X.

18

Or you could

Or, for that matter, if you sue, that

19

will ­­ that can ­­ I can deem that a breach of the

20

license agreement and ­­ and recover the ­­ the remedies

21

that patent law allows, an injunction and treble damages

22

and attorneys' fees in the context of a ­­ a willful

23

action.

24

I want to underscore, although the Federal

25

circuit made a broad rule, exactly what we have here.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In this case, Mirowski ­­ this license is from 1991.

2

Mirowski ­­ it's not in the record, but there's no

3

dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions

4

of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents.

5

It gets, as a benefit of this license ­­

6

notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product

7

and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start

8

accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2 ­­ of 2

9

points over prime, as soon as it sends us a notice.

10

And moreover, in the ­­ in the litigation

11

tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not

12

a party in the referenced St. Jude action, we would be

13

bound by any determination in that adjudication,

14

whereas, otherwise, we wouldn't.

15

So this license agreement was enormously

16

beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of

17

I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next

18

day, I turn around and sue you.

19

there would be lots and lots of remedies.

20

But, in that event,

I do want to underscore one other thing,

21

that the Federal circuit said that it was applying this

22

special rule only in MedImmune­type cases.

23

rationale of the court is that what causes the burden to

24

shift is the absence of a counterclaim for infringement.

25

But the

That would have, for example, caused the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Court

2

decided last term, where there was one researcher at NYU

3

who had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action.

4

There was no basis for Myriad to claim

5

infringement because he had made clear that he

6

wouldn't ­­ he wouldn't engage in the research and

7

clinical work that he was going to, so long as he was in

8

risk of patent infringement remedies.

9

source of the rule ­­ the source of the law where the

And that ­­ the

10

burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law.

11

this Court has said, for 125 years, that it rests with

12

the infringer.

13

And

What neither the Federal circuit nor my

14

friend on the other side of this case has ever

15

identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts

16

the burden in a declaratory judgment action?

17

be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that Act is

18

procedural only.

19

If I can reserve the balance of my time?

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

2

The government agrees that using the same

burden of proof that would apply in the hypothetical

coercive action that underlies the Declaratory Judgment

5

Act is the best thing to do in this mirror image

6

declaratory judgment action.

7

purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act and allows for

8

final resolution of the types of controversies that this

9

Court contemplated in MedImmune.

That best serves the

10

If I could turn to Justice Kagan's points

11

about an incident in which the parties had actually

12

agreed to ­­ whether certain products were covered by a

13

particular license.

14

That would be different from the situation

15

we have here because the products in question here

16

weren't actually in existence at the time of the

17

underlying license agreement.

18

aspect of the license agreement was to, as you said,

19

channel future disputes into this particular dispute

20

resolution mechanism.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The whole point of that

Are ­­ are you

22

suggesting that the burden­shifting rule should be

23

different in the hypothetical Justice Kagan ­­

24
25

MR. GANNON:

I was not about to suggest

that, Justice Sotomayor.

I was going to say that I

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think that's the ­­ that ­­ that that would probably be

2

the least logical way to deal with the quandary that

3

might arise from thinking that somebody is then trying

4

to breach the license.

5

And we don't think there's any license

6

breach here because there wasn't any prior agreement on

7

the fact that these future products were going to be

8

covered by the ­­ by these patents, that they'd be

9

practicing these patents.

10

But, even if there were some concern about

11

the licensee turning around and challenging the

12

agreement that it had previously made, it seems like the

13

problem there is either that they should be estopped by

14

what they already said in the agreement or Lear needs to

15

be extended to keep them from being estopped in that

16

way.

17

way to get at solving whatever the quandary there might

18

be.

19

But shifting the burden of proof seems like an odd

And I think that, at some point, this ­­

20

this also interweaves with a point that the Chief

21

Justice made, about whether Medtronic here is seeking to

22

change the status quo.

23

Medtronic is seeking to change the status quo here, for

24

a couple different reasons.

25

And we don't think that

One of them is, as I was just saying, that

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the agreement here didn't actually reach ­­ the license

2

agreement here didn't ­­ it didn't include a meeting of

3

the minds about whether these particular future products

4

would be covered by these patents, including one of the

5

patents was reissued after the time of the license.

6

And also, this license agreement expressly

7

preserved the parties' ability, including Medtronic's

8

ability, to challenge both the validity and the

9

enforceability of the patent.

That's at page 13 of the

10

Joint Appendix.

11

it can be legitimately said that Medtronic is trying to

12

either get out of its contractual obligations or to

13

change the status quo.

14

And so there's no way in which I think

The status quo, right now, is that the

15

royalties are collecting in a certified account, and so,

16

in a sense, both parties are trying to change the status

17

quo, in trying to get the stream of royalties that

18

either is applicable to these products or isn't, on the

19

basis of the resolution of a question that the parties

20

had not decided, but said would be decided in a

21

declaratory judgment action like this.

22

And we think that the best way to think of a

23

declaratory judgment action like this is that it is the

24

mirror image of the underlying coercive hypothetical

25

action that could have been brought against Medtronic.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well ­­ well, but I

2

guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an

3

action that could not have been brought because

4

Medtronic is paying royalties.

5

MR. GANNON:

Well, the same thing is true in

6

MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the ­­

7

in MedImmune, that the Declaratory Judgment Act was

8

intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it

9

would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to

10

be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it

11

thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the

12

risks associated with ­­ with breaching the license

13

and ­­ and being subject to treble damages, attorneys'

14

fees, and the other remedies that would be available

15

under the Patent Act.

And, yet, even though there had been no

17

infringement in that case and no breach of the contract

18

in that case, which is also true here, because, so far,

19

everybody has been behaving the way the license expected

20

them to behave, the Court recognized that the parties

21

had a concrete dispute about the applicability of the

22

patents to those particular products, that the scope of

23

the contract was not going to require payment of

24

royalties where the patent did not apply, and said that

25

the ­­ the issues that were going to be resolved in the

declaratory judgment action there were going to involve

2

questions of patent validity, patent enforceability, and

scope of coverage, patent infringement, which is exactly

4

what we have here.

5

Medtronic has raised in their complaint ­­

6

the well­pleaded complaint that you would look to here,

7

is one that arises under the Patent Act and includes

8

claims involving all three of those issues, just as was

9

the case in MedImmune.

It's a contract case with a

18

that I was just saying.

19

We think that this case involves a

I think that the way to ­­ the way to

20

conceptualize this is to look to what the well­pleaded

21

complaint would be in the hypothetical coercive action

22

that would be being brought against Medtronic if we

23

didn't have the problem presented by the fact that they

24

haven't actually breached the contract or infringed at

25

this point.

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And we have every reason to think that that

2

hypothetical coercive action is one that arises under

3

the patent laws because it's one involving infringement.

4

That's the dispute that the parties acknowledge that

5

they have.

6

In the litigation tolling agreement at page

7

20 of the Joint Appendix, it talks about the fact that

8

the parties have a dispute under Section 271 of the

9

Patent Act.

In the red brief here, Mirowski has ­­ has

10

told us on page 48 that, if Medtronic were to cease

11

paying royalties, that the recourse would be that they

12

would bring an infringement suit.

13

here in paragraph 5 alleges that the claim here arises

14

under the Patent Act.

And the complaint

15

And because it does arise under the Patent

16

Act and because it's clear here that all of the

17

defensive issues would also be Federal, as I mentioned

18

before, I think there is no dispute here that this ­­

19

this would arise under the patent laws, which would

20

provide for district court jurisdiction under Section

21

1338 and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal

22

circuit under Section 1295(a), even before the

23

amendments in the America Invents Act in 2011.

24
25

I think that there is one other point that
would be worth making in response to some of the amicus

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

briefs about the ­­ the potential problems here

2

associated with whether the parties have an incentive to

3

enter into these type of licensing arrangements.

4

As Mr. Waxman already explained, the

5

patentholder here got lots of benefits out of ­­ out of

6

entering into an agreement like this, notwithstanding

7

the fact that they would leave themselves open to

8

precisely the suits that the agreement contemplated,

9

which was a suit involving both infringement and

10

validity questions; and that, under the circumstances,

11

there's ­­ they had plenty of incentive to enter into a

12

license agreement, notwithstanding the fact that they

13

would continue to bear the same burden of proof that

14

they would bear in every other procedural context in

15

which patent infringement claims have arisen up until

16

now.

17

And so I think that, in that sense,

18

that's ­­ that's not a sea change from their

19

perspective.

20

think it so, as Mr. Waxman explained, a licensor in that

21

context would have several mechanisms that they could

22

use in order to rejigger the balance between the parties

23

if they wanted to.

24
25

And ­­ and, yet, even if they were to

And ­­ and I think that we agree with ­­
with everything on the list that Mr. Waxman mentioned,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

including having fully paid­up licenses or allowing a

2

suit for infringement or invalidity to constitute a

3

termination of the license that would allow the

4

patentholder to bring an infringement action.

6

If there are no further questions, we would
urge the Court to reverse.

default rule as set forth in Schaffer, which is the case

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how ­­ what do you do

with the government's argument here, which I take it as

4

being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I

5

understood it ­­ which is a big qualification ­­ the ­­

6

the ­­ some of these things are awfully complicated.

7

You might have a ­­ a claim or, really, it's a set of

8

claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols

9

and ­­ and 42 different sort of division possibilities.

10

And ­­ and then the ­­ the so­called

11

infringer, or the person who falls outside the coverage,

12

is looking at his product, and it's one of the most

13

complex things you've ever seen.

himself, well, how ­­ how am I supposed ­­ how does the

15

claim cover this?

16

many, many possibilities.

17

And he has to think to

And ­­ and it's ­­ there are many,

I take it that's what they mean when they

18

say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating

19

how the claim limitations map onto the accused product

20

because infringement may be found only when the product

21

falls within the scope ­­ scope of the asserted claim or

22

claims in every respect.

23

Your client, who's the patentee, knows how.

24

Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringement

25

suit or the inside­the­coverage suit or responding to

40
Alderson Reporting Company

2

someone who says it's outside the coverage.
But ­­ but the person who is the alleged

3

infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes

4

sense to put everything in the same place; notice of

5

infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.

6

And that way, it will be easier to focus on what's at

7

stake.

9

That's what I take it their argument is.

I've not got it right, you're certainly ­­

10

MR. NEUSTADT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. NEUSTADT:

13

First of all ­­ well, the first answer ­­

I think it's pretty close.
All right.
It's absolutely not true.

14

and I'll get to the second answer ­­ is if you have that

15

and say, well, it's more convenient for us to do it,

16

you're creating a patent law exception to the normal

default.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's ­­ it's not a patent

22

law exception.

23

device that simply changes the nominal status of the

24

parties doesn't change the substantive rules and that

25

the burden of proof counts as a substantive issue.

It's the recognition that a procedural

MR. NEUSTADT:

But you only have that

2

substantive rule where the patentee counterclaims.

3

the patentee counterclaims, you have two parties seeking

4

relief.

Naturally, the patentee has the burden of

5

proof.

If there is no counterclaim, there can be no

6

infringement.

When

You're just talking about claim coverage.

7

But it's the second part of your question,

8

Justice Breyer, what happens is the ­­ the patentee,

9

when they give notice of claim coverage, they can tell

10

them.

11
12
13
14

There's no mysteries ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But do they have to tell

them?
MR. NEUSTADT:
There's no mystery.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. NEUSTADT:

Well, they always do.
If ­­
They always do?
Well, sure.

I mean, if you

17

go into the suit, the first question is interrogatory,

18

why do you think this ­­ why do you think this is

19

covered?

20

much easier to prove non­infringement than to prove

21

infringement because these are governed by the all

22

elements rule.

23

So there's no mystery as to that.

And it's

The all elements rule means that if the

24

patentee wants to prove infringement of a claim that has

25

ten elements, he's got to prove ten elements or in ­­ or

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in your example, many more.
For the person who is ­­ is the licensee,

3

you want to prove non­infringement, he has to only pick

4

one of those elements and say, I don't have it.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see, that's a

6

good point.

7

whatever I quoted is a made­up thing, which doesn't

8

ever ­­ never really exists in your experience.

9
10
11
12

So what you're saying is that page 19 or

MR. NEUSTADT:

Oh, that's right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because the first question

would be, well, you tell me how ­­ how this infringes.
MR. NEUSTADT:

Yeah.

And that argument

13

wasn't even presented to the Federal circuit before its

14

decision.

15

rejected it and say, you've got to be kidding.

16

And the Federal circuit would have openly

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're saying, I don't

17

really care about what is an action where there is an

18

infringement action or there even could be one in the

19

circumstances before us, that's not my case because

20

they're going to pay me forever, if they lose this

21

declaratory judgment, so there's no shift.

22

And where there's no shift, you ought to

23

follow the rules for where there's no shift, which is

24

that the burden lies on the person bringing the suit.

25

MR. NEUSTADT:

That's exactly right.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. NEUSTADT:

That's your argument?
Yes.

The analysis that the

3

Federal circuit did is they've got a burden of proof

JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­ I see.
Let me find the controlling

law.

I've got only one party here seeking relief, and that's

9

the ­­ the licensee, so why shouldn't he prove this?

10

The controlling law is the normal default rule.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And your argument is that

11

the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19

12

never has come up, and as far as the no ­­ no res

13

judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same

3

Now, it is true that you're not applying

That's the whole point.

You should be able

5

if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply

6

coercion, and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of

proof.
MR. NEUSTADT:

Well, it doesn't shift the

burden of proof.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does shift the burden of

proof because if what they are worried about is your

about.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's just

But you would agree with

10

this, you would agree that, if that agreement of yours

11

read a little differently, if MedImmune ­­ if they had

12

said ­­ you know, we are not going to pay royalties

13

until your client brings an infringement suit, which you

14

intend to do, at that point, if you'd made that promise,

you would have the burden of proof because you'd bring

an infringement suit.

17

MR. NEUSTADT:

Well, of course.
And if they said either an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you are really

looking at it, though, from the point of view of a contract

action, rather than a patent action.

18

MR. NEUSTADT:

Well, it can't be a patent

19

action because the whole purpose of the license is not

20

to have an infringer.

21

that gets into the jurisdictional question.

And it is a contract action and

22

And, to answer Justice Ginsburg's question,

23

yes, there isn't the usual jurisdiction that you would
