CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question whether to

11

commit Federal bank fraud, the defendant must intend to

12

defraud a bank, or whether, as the Tenth Circuit held,

13

it's enough that the defendant intended to defraud

14

someone in order to obtain money the victim keeps in a

15

bank account.

16

interpretation, the government has prosecuted people

17

whose only relationship to a bank is that they tricked a

18

third party into issuing them a perfectly valid check,

19

which the defendant then cashed at a bank.

20

Applying the Tenth Circuit's

Such a broad interpretation of the Federal

21

bank fraud statute threatens to sweep in a garden

22

variety State law crime ­­ a broad sweep of the sort

23

that this Court has refused to give to Federal criminal

24

statutes absent a clear statement of congressional

25

intent.

And that ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it fits – it fits the

2

words Congress used, "obtained funds owned or controlled

3

by financial ­­ a financial institution by means of

4

false representation."

5

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, the problem is there is

6

an ambiguity in Subsection 2 about to whom the false

7

representation must be directed.

8

that ordinarily, you would construe that silence in

9

favor of breadth that ­­ in favor breadth that a false

Now, I acknowledge

10

statement to anyone would do.

11

reasons not to give that ambiguity, that interpretation

12

in this case.

13

But there are compelling

And one is the breadth that I mentioned.

It

14

enabled the government to bring cases like United States

15

v. Rodriguez where the government prosecuted a

16

bookkeeper who filed false invoices with her employer

17

that led the employer then to issue perfectly valid

18

checks to people who didn't do the work.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the

20

breadth is confined ­­ given the development of the

21

banking system, it may not seem as significant a

22

limitation today as in years past.

23

the definition of a financial institution is ­­ in

24

18 U.S.C. 20 is limited to institutions with a

25

particular Federal nexus.

But, nonetheless,

Federal Deposit Insurance,

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Federal Home Loan Bank, Small Business Investment Act.

2

It isn't any financial institution, but institutions in

3

which the Federal Government has a particular interest.

4

MR. RUSSELL:

That's true.

But nonetheless,

5

for precisely the reason you identified, it ­­ it covers

6

an awful lot of banks.

7

And if you read the statute ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But not in this case,

8

and that's where I'm having difficulty.

9

illogical to think that a falsehood rendered through a

Why is it

10

third party that might affect a bank, a false check, as

11

your client was charged with, that that would be the

12

very case Congress would have wanted covered?

13

MR. RUSSELL:

So that's a question about, I

14

think, whether intent to defraud a bank could be

15

satisfied in a case like this.

16

answer to that is possibly it could.

17

I think, tries to put you to a false choice between

18

saying you either have to accept the Tenth Circuit's

19

interpretation that sweeps in cases like United States

20

v. Rodriguez, perfectly valid checks that don't

21

implicate either of the core interests in a bank fraud

22

case, which is protecting the bank from financial harm

23

or protecting the bank from being lied to.

24

have to accept that or you have to leave unprosecutable

25

cases like this one.

And I think that the
So the government,

MR. RUSSELL:

So that gets the ­­ we have

7

two theories.

8

a bank is required and under that theory, the U.C.C.

9

10

We have the theory that intent to defraud

We also argue, though, if you don't

require intent to defraud a bank ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. RUSSELL:

Why would it not matter?
Because under the

government ­­ it doesn't matter under the government's

14

view or ours, so ­­

No, under your view.

your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a

19

amount of the check?

20

Why would it not matter from ­­ who would

MR. RUSSELL:

Under our view, all the

21

government has to show is that the defendant intended to

22

deceive a bank in order to obtain property that is owned

23

by or in the custody of a bank.

24

So a traditional altered check case ­­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So in a bank account.

I think on anybody's

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

theory, you ­­ you have to show that ­­ that the monies,

2

funds, credits, assets, securities or other property was

3

owned by or under the custody or control of the

4

financial institution.

5

MR. RUSSELL:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

That's right.
Doesn't either side have to

prove that?
MR. RUSSELL:

That's correct.

So the point

of departure is to whom the false statement has to be
directed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But ­­ but the jury has to

be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank.
MR. RUSSELL:

That's correct.

That's

14

correct.

15

U.C.C. is implicated in that inquiry, that ­­ that is

16

true under either one.

17

think it's just going to be a question of, you know,

18

whose money are you trying to get and is it in a bank

19

account.

20

And so that's ­­ to the extent you think the

I don't think that it is.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Two of the ­­ two of the

21

six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank.

22

Isn't that so?

23

MR. RUSSELL:

I

That is correct.

And so ­­

24

but under our principal view that the problem here is

25

that the government ­­ that the jury wasn't instructed

that Petitioner had to intend to defraud a bank as

2

opposed to Target.

checks were cashed or not.

4

under the risk of loss theory because it only has to be

5

a risk of loss, not an actual loss.

6

And so it doesn't matter whether the
And it doesn't even matter

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you have a ­­ you

7

have a credible textual argument, but you run into the

8

problem that your interpretation makes Section ­­

9

Subsection 1 surplusage.

How do you get around that?

10

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't know that we do, but

11

the Tenth Circuit's interpretation doesn't either,

12

because under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, one is

13

rendered surplusage because any prosecution that could

14

be brought under (1) could also be brought under (2).

15

If it's enough under (2) that you intend to defraud

16

someone, it's surely enough that you intended to defraud

17

a bank.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, under the alternative,

19

there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much

20

broader category or it reaches a broader category.

21

it's not useless.

22

MR. RUSSELL:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, that's true.

So

And ­­

instances where the representation is made to somebody

2

the representation is made to the bank.

3

interpretation where (2) requires that the

5

having two subsections.

6

7

(1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which
But under your

You might as well just have

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I have two things to say

8

to that.

9

they were doing in (2) is making clear that the statute

One is Congress may have thought that what

10

encompasses the broad range of particular kinds of

11

property interests that are unique or ­­ or at least

12

common in the banking context.

13

serves the same function as the second clause in the

14

mail fraud statute upon which this statute is premised.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in that way it

It doesn't have the two

16

subparts.

17

read the word "or," "(1) or (2)" to mean (1) including

18

(2).

19

But here you are essentially asking us to

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, that's the same way that

20

this Court has repeatedly read the two parallel clauses

21

of the bank fraud statute.

22

you know, the difference in hardware terms and numerals.

23

But I don't think ­­

24
25

The only difference being,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What this Court did

after the ­­ after ­­ or before this statute ­­ this

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of

2

the mail fraud statute.

3

MR. RUSSELL:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's right.
Every court that had

5

looked at it at the time the statute was passed had

6

determined there were two separate provisions.

7

would Congress have any reason to believe they were

8

passing a singular case, a singular charge?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

So why

I think what Congress would

10

have intended is simply that when it uses the

11

identical ­­ materially identical language and structure

12

in two statutes, that they would have the same meaning

13

as determined by this Court.

14

The interpretive principle that the

15

government relies on that identically­worded statutes

16

can mean very different things depending on the state of

17

the circuit law at the time Congress copies the language

18

is really untenable.

19

defendant, for example, to know what that circuit

20

precedent was and not be able to simply rely on this

21

Court's decisions interpreting the identical language in

22

another statute.

23

And it requires a criminal

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's not identical

24

because in the bank fraud statute, Congress broke out

25

and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that in the mail fraud.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

Now, I understand that.

But I

3

don't think that if Congress intended this statute to

4

operate dramatically different from the mail fraud

5

statute, the only change it would have made was as those

6

sort of typographical changes.

7

way Congress conveys that kind of intent.

I don't think that's the

8

But again, even if you think that Subsection

9

(2) creates an independent offense, it's susceptible of

10

the interpretation that we give you, which avoids having

11

to federalize the kinds of cases that are at issue in

12

United States v. Rodriguez.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One understanding of what

14

led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze,

15

which actually seems on all fours with this case, right?

16

Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then

17

asks for money from the bank.

18

as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a

19

fraudulent check.

20

arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud,

21

why should we rule for you here?

22

Essentially the same case

So if we understand this statute as

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I guess I have to just

23

dispute the premise.

24

the rule, the principle of law that Maze adopted, which

25

made it impossible to use the wire fraud statute and

I think Congress was reacting to

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mail fraud statute to prosecute a case even when

2

somebody goes into a bank and cashes a counterfeit check

3

because the then use of the mail to settle the account

4

afterwards wasn't good enough.

5

was concerned of.

And that's what Congress

6

In this Court's own decision in Maze, the

7

Court noted that Congress had dealt with the specific

8

factual problem in Maze through an amendment, then

9

recent amendment to the Truth­in­Lending Act, which

10

prohibited credit card fraud.

11

remedies in another section of the same statute that

12

enacted the bank fraud statute and then dealt with the

13

parallel problem with respect to altered checks in

14

Section 513, which is also part of that same statute, which

15

criminalizes any use of an altered check to deceive

16

anyone without regard to whose property the defendant is

17

intending to obtain.

18

Congress added to those

So when you're worried about altered check

19

cases here, and we need to not just be worried about

20

these cases because this decision will implicate a whole host

21

of other cases.

22

altered check cases, Congress dealt with altered check

23

cases in Section 513.

24

penalties under 513 and 31 ­­ and the bank fraud

25

provision are very different.

But if you're thinking just about

And that's important because the

It's a 30­year sentence

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for bank fraud and a 10­year sentence for a Section 513.

2

And more importantly, the bank fraud statute is a

3

predicate for aggravated identity theft, which imposes a

4

mandatory 2­year minimum sentence that must be served

5

consecutive to any other sentence.

6

And so in a petty case like this, the

7

difference between somebody being charged for the bank fraud

8

and being charged under 513 for a first­time offender

9

can be the difference between zero to 6 months and 2 to

10

2 and a half years.

11

enormous plea bargaining leverage.

12

understand why the government wants a broad

13

interpretation here.

And that gives the government
So you can

14

But it's also equally understandable that

15

Congress would have thought that cases in which

16

somebody's using an altered check in a way that

17

negligently or knowingly poses some risk to a bank is ­­

18

warrants less punishment than when somebody directly

19

targets the bank itself for deception in order to obtain

20

bank property.

21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why ­­ why is that?

Why

would Congress have wanted to make that difference?

MR. RUSSELL:

Yeah.

I think that Congress

3

would have thought it's more serious for somebody to

4

target a bank than it is for somebody to use an altered

5

check that has a risk to a bank.

6

illustrates, using an altered check doesn't necessarily

7

impose a financial cost on the bank.

Congress could think that's a much more serious thing.

me that this case can be distinguished from the example

So the question is how to get

suppose, through the government's proposed fallback

So there are ­­ there are

several things wrong with the government's fallback

13

as intent to defraud.

14

cases, both our rule and their fallback rule permits

prosecution.

21

about cases like ours where an altered check is

23

permits them to continue to prosecute those cases.

24
25

Because if it's an altered

Now, even if you agree with them that those
kinds of cases fall within the scope of the statute,

that ­­ all you need to do then is to say, look, those

2

cases aren't materially different than when you submit

3

the check to the bank in the first place, that the

4

altered check shows intent to defraud the bank in

5

third­party cases just like it does in a first­party

6

case.

7

not these kinds of cases are covered.

8

right about that, then there's obviously no reason to

9

adopt, you know, a rule that they made up just to deal

with those kinds of cases.

Now, we think that they're wrong about whether or

the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a

bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether

22

Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's

fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't

8
9

That would seem to me the simplest theory.

MR. RUSSELL:

I think what courts have said

is that those kinds of schemes are directed at

10

victimizing the third party, not a bank, and that leaves

11

to the States their traditional authority to prosecute

12

bad check cases, which I don't think should be

troublesome.

Court's decision in Maze as well as in Williams, which

9

had curtailed the Government's ability to prosecute

10
11

Clause (2) targets schemes to

And Congress enacted

precisely these types of fraud.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Yang, your

12

interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze.

13

Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or

14

forged check or something like that, but if I understand

15

your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell

16

a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a

17

famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my

18

kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a

19

perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is

20

obviously as to the person who's just bought the

21

painting.

22

interpretation would cover that case as well.

23

It has nothing to do with the bank.

MR. YANG:

That is correct.

But your

Our

24

understanding of the text, and the reason why that is

25

the case is because Congress specified in clause (2)

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the scheme to obtain money or property from the

2

bank has to be by means of a false or fraudulent

3

pretense, but it doesn't specify to whom that false or

4

fraudulent pretense must be made.

5

Now, we understand that that sweeps in

6

broader than what Maze ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it's just a little bit

8

peculiar, right?

9

the government can't prosecute the person.

I mean, if somebody pays me in cash,
If somebody

10

pulls out a check, the government can, but that doesn't

11

seem to make a whole lot of sense in terms of what the

12

statute is about.

13

MR. YANG:

Well, we think that the text

14

suggests that what Congress was doing was enacting a

15

broad prophylactic, because what Congress was

16

addressing, remember, were situations where this Court

17

had construed narrowly statutes which addressed

18

situations like this where banks were the inherent

19

second­line victims, and so what Congress wanted to

20

avoid is ­­

the victim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

Please

14

answer, how do we get to your reading from the text of

15

the statute.

16

MR. YANG:

I will.

The way you get there is

17

that Congress, in Clause 2, again, remember, specifies

18

you have intent to obtain money or property from a bank

19

by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,

20

representations, or promises.

21

whom those false or fraudulent representations must be

22

made.

23

It does leave silent to

Now, if you look at the legislative history,

24

it's very clear that Congress was at least concerned

25

with situations like Maze where a bank would be a victim

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a fraud.

2

precisely like what we have here, where the reason that

3

the bank is a secondary victim is because that false

And those ­­ and Maze involved a situation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So far I'm with you, but

you haven't answered my question.
MR. YANG:

But the way it is in that

8

context, the reason that the bank is the victim of the

9

scheme is because the fraudulent method is actually

10

transferred to the bank as an inherent part of the

11

scheme itself.

12

And so ­­

MR. YANG:

I don't think we are relying on

the idea that the ­­ what the Court is ­­ would be doing

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does the rule of lenity

12

provide a precedent for us to adopt the narrowing

13

interpretation, your fallback position?

14

MR. YANG:

I think just in any context where

15

you might have constitutional doubt, the Court

16

sometimes, you know, construes a statute in a way that

17

it might not otherwise do.

18

And here what we're giving you the hook for

19

this is that the means specified leaves open to whom

20

that false or fraudulent communication must be directed.

21

You could read, in light of the history and in light of

22

what Congress's main intent was here, to read the

23

statute as saying, ah, Congress actually in clause 2 was

24

concerned with the specific type of means, that is the

25

means that are directed to the bank.

45
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Yang, your first order

2

argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would

3

read a statute that says "(1) or (2)," is to interpret

4

it as meaning two different things.

5

MR. YANG:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
But that requires us to read

7

it differently from the way we read the exact same

8

words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in

9

McNally.

And we know that Congress wanted the bank

10

fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud

11

statutes.

12

if we go with your friend over there, we read a statute

13

in a way we wouldn't normally.

14

we have to read these two statutes that say the same

15

thing and that we know Congress meant to say the same

16

thing differently.

why.

20

this is on page 5A in the bank frauds ­­ or the mail

21

fraud statute is 1341 on 2A, they are quite different.

22

I mean, even when we just look at the statutory

23

structure alone, Congress broke these clauses up, put

24

them on different lines, numbered them, indented them

25

equally.

First, when you look at the statute, Section 1344,

1

And Congress I don't think in 1984 could have been more

2

clear about its intent to make these two provisions,

3

that is the intent to defraud and the intent to obtain

4

provisions, distinct based on the choices that it made

5

in text.

6

It's just, I think, impossible to read the

7

text and come away with the conclusion that in 1984 what

8

Congress intended, regardless of what happened in the

9

mail fraud statute in 1987, that Congress intended that,

10

or notwithstanding the only reading of "or" in this

11

context that makes any textual sense, since it's not

13

that Congress meant that "or" in that structure to mean

14

anything but "or."

That is, a disjunctive, two separate

And in fact, it would be anomalous to do so

because Section (2) covers, for instance, bank­owned
