ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Section 922(g)(9) was enacted to protect

12

battered women and children and to close a dangerous

13

loophole in Federal law that allowed domestic abusers to

14

possess firearms.

15

That loophole existed because many domestic

16

abusers were only convicted of misdemeanor offenses, and

17

the misdemeanor offenses they were most often convicted

18

of were assault and battery crimes.

19

Respondent asks this Court to adopt an

20

interpretation of 922(g)(9) that would indisputably

21

exclude the assault and battery laws of almost all of

22

the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

23

render the statute a virtual dead letter from the moment

24

of its enactment until today, and it would leave that

25

dangerous loophole wide open.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

That would

Official

The statutory text does not compel that

2

implausible result.

To the contrary, this Court

3

ordinarily presumes that common law terms of art bear

4

their common law meaning, and here, the common law

5

meaning of force is a natural fit.

6

It makes perfect sense to define a ­­

And our view is that it

25

common law.

At common law, physical force included not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

only direct uses of force by the aggressor himself, but

2

also indirect or subtle uses of force.

3

poisoning, for example, were considered to involve the

4

use of physical force at common law.

5

So things like

Respondent doesn't dispute that

6

understanding of the common law at page 40 of their brief.

7

Instead, what they ask this Court to do is to depart

8

from that common law meaning with respect to the

9

statute.

The Court normally does presume that common

10

law terms of art bear their common law meaning, and

11

there is no basis to depart here.

it to a felony offense.

of the nonviolent conduct that is being prosecuted under

The question of

1

whether use of force ­­ whether force was used in the

2

ordinary sense is a separate question.

3

whether or not physical force, violent physical force,

4

has a ordinary meaning and whether ­­ as opposed to ­­ to

5

the common law meaning of battery is a separate

6

question.

7

The question of

Focusing on that first, clearly, we think

8

Congress intended to adopt in this statute the same

9

definition of physical force and of violent force as it

10

did in the Armed Career Criminal Act, which is before

11

this court in Johnson, because it used almost exactly

12

the same language.

13

Something that the government really doesn't

14

talk about at all is that the language in this statute

15

is based directly on the language used in ACCA and the

16

language previous to that, which is used in 18 USC

17

Section 16, the generic definition of crime of violence.

18

Congress took that definition and it put it in the

19

statute.

20

It modified it in one respect, in a way

21

which I think is quite helpful to us.

22

narrowed the category of crimes that are covered here.

my answer to your ­­ to your prior question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Please.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

It's exactly what Congress

2

had in mind here, and I think we do agree with the

3

government on this, that Congress perceived a loophole

4

in the law at the time because the firearm restriction

5

at the time applied only to felons and people who

6

engaged in violent conduct, as Senator Lautenberg, the

7

principal sponsor said, that because of the outdated

8

thinking by prosecutors, people who engaged in violent

9

conduct that would be prosecuted against as a felony, if

10

committed against somebody else, was prosecuted as a

11

misdemeanor because a family member was the victim.

12

And so Congress wanted to close that

13

loophole by saying people who engage in this kind of

14

violence against a family member could not escape.

15

so violent misdemeanors were directed ­­ were defined

16

here.

17

put it, if you beat your neighbor's wife or batter your

18

neighbor's wife, that's a felony.

19

battery your wife or your child, that's a misdemeanor,

20

and we have to get past that.

21

And

And ­­ and as Senator Wellstone very graphically

If you beat or

decide that case to say that offensive touching, that

mere touching was not enough, that something more than

that is required.

required, and force requiring ­­ having the effect of

some level of pain and injury satisfies that.

think the Court focused specifically on what level, if

any level were required.

I don't

powerful use of force.

sufficient specificity in the indictments so that it

19

will allow for that to be picked up and qualified as a

predicate offense as appropriate.

21

I think the answer, as I suggested earlier

22

to Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice, the answer

23

cannot be that because we have practical problems in the

24

application of this in some states, that we're going to

apply significant Federal criminal penalties to people

47
Alderson Reporting Company

who lie outside the plain terms of the statutory text

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. ROTHFELD:

I would say that if someone

who did that is prosecuted under a generic assault

statute that does not have as an element the use of

14

force and the relevance that is violent force, then

15

that ­­ that is true.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that means that on

17

your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we

18

know Congress wanted to cover.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I ­­ I would take issue

20

with that, Your Honor.

I think that we know Congress

21

wanted to cover is what it said in the statutory text.

22

It wanted to cover violent crimes, and it wanted to

23

cover people who use simple force to commit these violent

24

crimes.

25

kind of thing were being prosecuted for misdemeanors.

It had in mind that many people who did this

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Some of those misdemeanors ­­ I think I,

2

here again, take issue with the government that both the

3

generic assault statutes and other kinds of both

4

aggravated assault statutes and specific kinds of

5

criminal acts that are addressed by individual statutes

6

could be invoked in situations like that.

7

And it may well be, as Justice Scalia

8

suggested, that when Congress enacted this statute, it

9

had a ­­ it had a sense that ­­ it certainly was aware

10

that people were being prosecuted by misdemeanors.

11

think it may well Congress really was not thinking ­­

12

did not have a clear sense of how the language that it

13

used would interact with modified categorical and

14

categorical approaches as squared against the state

15

statute, how that would apply.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Would it make any

17

difference in your view if instead of domestic violence,

18

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said

19

misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

It ­­ it would make quite a

21

difference.

22

crucial to this case and something the government

23

ignores, that Congress used the language virtually

24

identical to language that it had used in prior statutes

25

like ACCA, adopting the language of "violence" as it had

The face ­­ the fact is, I think it is

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

done in ACCA, as it did in 18 USC Section 16 in the

2

definition of ­­ the generic definition of crime of

3

violence.

4

And I ­­ I guess this returns to a question

5

that Justice Sotomayor asked at the outset of Ms.

6

Sherry's argument.

7

different when it said domestic violence?

8

that is no.

9

Did Congress mean something
The answer to

The Congress used ­­ defined a specific

10

crime with elements that are identical to other generic

11

crimes of violence to the generic crime of violent

12

felony, to the generic crime of violence in 18 USC 16.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Rothfeld, this might

14

go back to our difference on what Johnson said.

15

you're asking us to apply a higher standard than

16

Johnson, which just said force capable of causing

17

physical pain or injury to another person without any

18

notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot.

19

But

And ­­ you know, I ­­ I can see an argument

20

that says we should apply the exact same standard as

21

Johnson.

22

should apply a lower standard because this is

23

misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't

24

see an argument about why we should apply a higher

25

standard than Johnson.

I can see an argument that says actually, we

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I ­­ I do not suggest

2

that you should apply a higher standard than Johnson.

3

will say two things about that.

4

definition in our statute is a stricter definition.

5

covers a narrower category of crimes, as I said before,

6

than ­­ than the ACCA definition does because when we

7

reach threats ACCA addresses ­­ you know, any threat of

8

use of force, and this statute addresses only a threat

9

of use of a deadly weapon, a much more serious and

10

I

First, in fact, the
It

narrower category.

11

So it clear ­­ it is clear that Congress

12

thought about the definition it was using here; it

13

didn't sort of mindlessly take the definition that

14

appeared in ACCA and in 18 USC Section 16 and just kind

15

of plop it in there.

16

It actually thought about it, decided that

17

it wanted to use that definition, and then decided that

18

it wanted to ­­ type in that definition.

those reasons the government's suggestion that we

definition in Johnson ­­

It is not ­­ it's not a soap in the eyes;

So I did not take Johnson.

12

tell us what it meant.

14

being anything which causes any de minimis level of pain

15

of violence, which is extreme, unusual, very powerful

force.

19

I guess a couple of other small points.

20

the Court were to adopt the government's standard,

21

because the language that is used here is identical

22

in ­­ in our statute and in ACCA, I think it would have

23

to be a case that whatever the Court says about the

24

nature of the injury that is inflicted that is

25

sufficient to be violent force in this statute applies

26

in the violent felony context as well.

52
Alderson Reporting Company

If

1

I think it would be quite extraordinary to

2

think that ­­ you know, soap in the eyes, which triggers

3

a ­­ a State battery prosecution would be sufficient to

qualify as a violent felony, and ­­ and make someone

5

subject to a 15­year mandatory Federal prison sentence.

6

I mean, that is quite a remarkable outcome.

7

And because Congress did use exactly the

the consequence of adopting the government's position

here.

11

would be limited to the statute.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I have four points.

10

Number one, Justice Breyer, you are exactly right and it

11

does mean something different in this statute.

12

Kagan, it is a lesser definition of physical force.

13

Justice

There is ­­ this is a misdemeanor offense,

14

it's not a felony offense.

15

understanding of physical force applies directly here.

16

It's a perfect fit, unlike in Johnson.

17

Common law misdemeanor,

Also this is a fundamentally different

18

statute.

19

15­year mandatory minimum sentence.

20

ACCA of saying it's not a violent felony means there's

21

no mandatory minimum, but the individual still cannot

22

possess a gun, and a sentence in court can still take

23

prior convictions into consideration.

24

prohibition that applies equally to nonviolent felons,

25

to drug addicts, to the mentally ill, to and other classes of

This is not ACCA; we're not talking about a

A consequence in

This is a gun

Official

1

individuals that Congress thought could not be trusted

2

to possess a gun.

3

The second point, we're talking about

4

criminal convictions here.

5

serious enough to require police intervention and to

6

have someone prosecuted to a successful conviction.

7

so if you look through the cases, these are not examples

8

of husbands tapping their wives or giving them a paper

9

cut or stubbing their toe.

10
11

These are events that are

These are cases of real

domestic abuse.

12

flaws in Respondent's argument, he acknowledges the

13

legislative history.

15

these violent individuals who are convicted of

16

misdemeanors are not convicted of misdemeanors in the

17

But

They're actually convicted of violating

19

certain State laws.

20

State laws that are on the books do not qualify as

21

misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence in his ­­ under

22

his interpretation.

23

And the State laws that exist, the

And the fourth point is I would encourage

24

the Court to look at the State statutes that we do cite

25

in the appendix.

And I would disagree, I do not think

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they can be broken down in the way that Respondent

2

suggests.

3

Certainly, in their brief, they don't point

4

to any examples where any of those State statutes would

5

qualify under their definition, which would exclude not

6

only offensive touching, but would also exclude bodily

7

injury cases like the one at issue here.

8
9

And we're not talking about just the generic
assault and battery laws.

In Appendix C and D of our

10

brief, we also cite domestic­specific ­­ domestic

11

violence laws, domestic assault, and domestic battery

12

laws.

13

And it is quite perverse to think that

14

Congress adopted a statute that was designed to take

15

guns away from domestic abusers and chose to define

16

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in a way that not

17

only excludes generic assault and battery laws, but also

18

excludes most domestic assault and battery laws.

The practical effect here is far worse than
