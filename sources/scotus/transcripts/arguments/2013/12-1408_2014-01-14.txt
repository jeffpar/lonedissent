ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

within FICA's definition of wages, which includes all

13

remuneration for employment.

14

15

16

broadly to encompass the entire employer­employee

17

relationship.

Consistent with the

The payments here, which were paid only to

19

Respondent's employees and were keyed to the employees'

20

positions, salary levels, and length of service, clearly

21

were part of the employer­employee relationship.

22

Two particular features of the statute, I

23

think, make especially clear that separation­related

24

payments like this are covered.

definition of wages, both historically and currently,

First, the basic

Alderson Reporting Company

1

has been subject to specific exclusions for certain

2

types of separation­related pay such as retirement pay.

3

Those exclusions would be unnecessary if the basic

4

definition of wages didn't cover separation­related

5

payments.

6

Second, one of the historical exclusions,

7

which was in the statute from 1939 to 1950, was for

8

certain types of dismissal payments.

9

eliminated the exception for certain types of dismissal

When Congress

payments in 1950, the accompanying House report made

11

clear what would already have been in any event implicit

12

in the repeal itself, which is that from that point

13

forward, all dismissal payments, which were ­­ Congress

14

understood in the House report to include any payment on

15

account of an employee's involuntary separation, would

16

be considered wages under FICA.

Respondent's reliance in this case on

Section 3402(o) is a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In any

1

decision that says that the ­­ the term "wages" should

2

be interpreted the same way for FICA purposes and income

3

tax?

4

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, two points about that,

5

Your Honor.

6

decision in Rowan suggests that this Court or any court

7

needs to look to substantive rules of income tax

8

withholding to determine the basic definition of wages

9

for purposes of FICA.

10

First of all, nothing in this Court's

I think it's clear from the preamble to

11

Section 3402(o) that Congress was focused on Chapter 24

12

and was trying to solve a specific problem within

13

Chapter 24, the income tax withholding chapter, and it

14

didn't intend to send essentially shock waves through

15

the Internal Revenue Code that would affect the

16

definition of wages in other chapters.

17

Second, Respondent's view, I think, would

18

undercut the basic principle animating Rowan, which is

19

the idea that the definitions of wages should be

20

congruent for purposes of administrability.

21

Respondent's reading, which would say that none of the

22

payments specified in Section 3402(o)(2)(a) can possibly

23

be considered wages for FICA purposes, but nevertheless

24

must be treated as wages for withholding purposes, would

25

require employers to keep separate track of wages for

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the two different purposes and report them separately

2

when they do W­2 forms for the employees or their own

3

941 tax returns.

4

Now, Respondents have conceded that Section

5

3402(o) did not modify the preexisting definition of

6

"wages" under either FICA or the income tax withholding

7

chapter.

8

definition of "wages" in FICA, even before Section

9

3402(o) was enacted, contained a hole precisely the size

10

and shape of the definition of supplemental unemployment

11

compensation benefits that Congress later codified in

12

Section 3402(o)(2)(a).

13

Instead, their argument seems to be that the

Now, they haven't pointed to a single

14

statutory provision, regulation, or revenue ruling that

15

would have given Congress that view.

16

reason to believe that that hole existed before the

17

enactment of Section 3402(o) and its common ground that

18

it doesn't exist after Section 3402(o).

19

There is simply no

It's also important to understand why

20

Congress enacted Section 3402(o).

21

Section 3402(o) in response to a suggestion by the

22

Treasury Department in 1969 that there was a problem

23

with supplemental unemployment benefit payments.

24

"Supplemental unemployment benefit payments" was a term

25

that the IRS itself had used in a series of revenue

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress enacted

Official

1

rulings that considered certain payments by employers

2

that were intended to supplement State unemployment

3

compensation benefits, and the IRS in those rulings had

4

determined that those benefits were not wages.

5

Now, the IRS in 1969 informed Congress that

6

because these benefits were considered non­wages, it was

7

creating a problem, namely, that income taxes weren't

8

being withheld and the recipients of the payments were

9

receiving large income tax bills at the end of the year.

10

Congress enacted Section 3402(o) to address

11

that specific problem.

12

definition of wages.

13

14

of wages that was enacted ­­

the effect of that was that they were receiving

pavements during the year that were considered income

16

and as to which they would owe income tax, but the

17

income tax wasn't being regularly withheld as ­­ as it

the effect of the government's position.
In the States, if these ­­ if we say these

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what

2

about the States that say we will supply unemployment

3

compensation only if there is not another source of

4

unemployment compensation?

5

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, if the Court adopts

6

the government's position in this case, there's not

7

going to be any change in the States because the

8

government's position is the status quo.

9

Now, there are certain States that do look

10

to the Federal definition of "wages" in order to

11

determine whether an individual qualifies for

12

unemployment benefits under State law.

13

were to reach some other conclusion in this case than

14

the one the ­­ the government is urging, it is possible

15

that there could be some effect in those States on

16

qualification for State unemployment benefits.

17

And if the Court

But since State unemployment benefit

18

qualification is largely a matter of State law, the

19

States could adjust to that however they saw fit.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it ever to the

long­term advantage to the employee to have FICA

22

withholding, so that the employee's account is greater

23

and the benefits are greater?

MR. FEIGIN:

So for ­­ certain employees may

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the payments were

was just a flat severance payment.

17

MR. FEIGIN:

It

We still think that would meet

18

the basic definition of "wages" under FICA, Your Honor,

19

and would still count as wages and be taxable under

20

FICA.

21

because the payments were clearly keyed to critical

22

aspects of the employment relationship.

23

I think this case is even easier than that

Indeed, in the case of the post­petition

24

payments, the payments were expressly conditioned on the

25

employee's willingness to remain performing services for

Alderson Reporting Company

Respondents during the pendency of the bankruptcy

proceedings.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in the Coffy case, the

4

Court drew a distinction between compensation for

5

services and payments that are contingent on the

6

employee's being thrown out of work.

7

doesn't that apply here?

8
9

MR. FEIGIN:

But that ­­ why

So Coffy was addressing not

FICA, but a statute that dealt with veterans' rights

10

returning to work after a period of military service.

11

As construed by this Court, that statute drew a

12

distinction between a reward for length of service, to

13

which the returning veteran was entitled, and short­term

14

compensation for services rendered to which the

15

returning benefit ­­ returning veteran ­­ excuse me ­­

16

was not entitled.

17

Now, that distinction doesn't exist under

18

FICA.

19

reward for length of service, as this Court held that

20

the payments in Coffy were, it would still be

21

remuneration for services under FICA's definition of

22

wages.

23

Even if a particular payment is considered a

For example, if you were to give an employee

24

an award after 20 years of service, that would clearly

25

be a reward for length of service and would qualify as

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

such under Coffy, but would not be remuneration for

2

employment.

3

Now, the specific question you asked,

4

Justice Alito, about the difference between payments

5

that are part of the continuing employment and payments

6

that occur at the end of the employment relationship, is

7

also not a distinction that FICA draws.

8
9

As I said earlier, there are a number of
historical and current exclusions for certain types of

10

payments that are triggered by the end of the employment

11

relationship.

12

statute expressly excluded retirement pay.

13

think there is a reasonable reading of the basic

14

definition of "wages" under FICA that would include

15

retirement pay but exclude severance payments.

For example, from 1954 to 1983 the
I don't

16

And again, I think it's very pertinent here,

17

and probably the best piece of evidence we have in this

18

case about congressional intent, that Congress from 1939

19

to 1950 excluded from the basic definition of "wages" in

20

FICA certain types of dismissal payments, by which it

21

meant payments on account of involuntary separation; and

22

then it eliminated that exclusion in 1950, making clear

23

both as a statutory matter and it's clear in the

24

legislative history that such payments, that is payments

25

on account of involuntary separation, would from that

12

point forward be covered as wages under FICA.

25

dispute lies.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It is our position that SUB payments is not

2

remuneration for services because it is contingent, as

3

indicated previously on the Coffy case, upon losing your

4

job.

5

There is a problem on the public policy

6

issue that the Government is telling the Court today,

7

and the problem is if what they say is SUB pay is tied

8

to State unemployment benefits, then it is not wages and

9

subject to FICA.

They say if it's ­­ if you receive

10

supplemental unemployment benefits but you do not

11

receive State unemployment, then it is subject to FICA

12

taxes and is wages.

13

So, what they are saying to the Court is if

14

you have the ability to receive both the supplemental

15

unemployment benefits and the State unemployment

16

benefits, then we are not going to tax you with FICA

17

taxes, but if you only receive less, being just the

18

supplemental unemployment benefits, then it is going to

19

be wages and then it's going to be subject to FICA

taxes.

3

benefits are not wages.

4

1960, when 501(c)(17) was enacted dealing with trusts

5

and their exemption from the taxes, the definition of

6

"supplemental unemployment benefits" has always had its

own definition.

example, the revenue ruling that the Government issued

12

In 1986 Congress reenacted the withholding

13

statute and the FICA statute with the knowledge that

1977 revenue ruling was in place; and therefore, it's

15

presumed that FICA taxes are not ­­ or that supplemental

unemployment benefits are not subject to FICA taxes.

Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right.

10

Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits.

11

It's never come up in the other context since this

12

because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.

13

MR. HERTZBERG:

I don't think you can, based

14

upon when you look at what the statute says, 3402(o).

15

It says that they should be treated as if they are

16

wages.

17

If they were already wages, there would have

18

been no necessity of treating them if they were wages.

19

If you also look at the title of the section, it says

20

"other than wages."

21

they wouldn't use the word "other than wages."

22

It's clear that if it was wages,

And if you look at the legislative history

23

also, it says in three different places that they're not

24

wages and also indicates it's not remuneration for

25

services.

So the reason that 3402(o) was enacted was

because of the 1968 Treasury regulation that had the

MR. HERTZBERG:

No, they're ­­ they're

3

termination.

4

unemployment benefits are paid pursuant to a plan, and

5

they are also based upon a layoff or a plant closing.

6

The difference is supplemental

And a dismissal payment, for example, which

7

is a separate category, and treated separately in the

8

Treasury regulations, is an involuntary termination.

9

And that's where it ends.

And it can be based upon a

10

loss of employment through a firing or a cancellation of

11

a contract.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll take it that you're

13

right, that the Congress that passed the withholding statute

14

thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but

15

they were wrong.

16

Now, that wouldn't be the first time either.

17

So ­­ but Congress did think it.

18

supposed to give to what Congress thought then about

19

what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that

20

passed the wage definition in the withholding statute

21

thought?

22

MR. HERTZBERG:

So what weight am I

You should give it, Your

23

Honor, a lot of weight.

24

because in 1986, the withholding and the FICA statutes

25

were reenacted in full, including 3402(o).

And the reason you should is

22
Alderson Reporting Company

And at that

Official

point in time, there was a revenue ruling in place that

2

said that all supplemental unemployment benefits are not

Congress would have been presumed to have been aware of

supplemental unemployment benefits are given to an

17

And as I indicated in the ­­ even the

21

Where we differ is, is that we say all of

22

them are not wages and not subject to FICA.

23

government says is, no, we'll issue a revenue ruling and

24

we flip flopped our position several times on the

25

different revenue rulings, but whatever revenue ruling

What the

Official

1

we happen to issue at this point in time will determine

2

whether the supplemental unemployment benefits qualify

3

as wages for FICA purposes or are not wages.

4

It's our position that the statute is clear.

5

When you look at it, especially in light of 3402(o),

6

and ­­ because there would have been no reason for

7

enactment of that section if supplemental unemployment

8

benefits were wages already, because they would have

9

been subject to FICA.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the government

11

explains 3402(o) on the ground that there had been prior

12

admin ­­ IRS administrative decisions exempting certain

13

types of SUB payments from the definition of wages.

14

that ­­ that can explain that language.

that they are ­­ that SUB payments are to be treated as

But looking at the statute itself and

Congress was thinking at that point in time, because it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I first want to address Justice Sotomayor's

6

question.

7

revenue rulings that the IRS has issued are irrational

8

or invalid, the only colorable reason for believing that

9

is because the payments that those revenue rulings

Justice Sotomayor, if you believe that the

10

classify as non­wages are clearly wages under FICA's

11

basic definition.

12

And if you believe the revenue rulings are

13

invalid for that reason, then that is all the more

14

reason to rule for the government here, because

15

Respondent's position would create an even bigger hole

16

in the statute that would classify even more payments as

17

non­wages and is even less consistent with the statute.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

what I was thinking.

20

Justice Scalia's point.

21

MR. FEIGIN:

You were touching at

Why don't you answer
Why is (o) not superfluous?
So, Your Honor, we acknowledge

22

that the revenue rulings are not consistent with the

23

statutory text of FICA.

24

certain payments from classification as wages that the

25

plain text of FICA unambiguously classify as wages.

The revenue rulings accept

26
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

revenue rulings are a continuation of a practice that

2

began in the 1950s and '60s, which was a somewhat more

3

freewheeling time in the history of statutory

4

interpretation.

5

And to the extent the IRS would defend these

6

in a case in which they're challenged in court, it would

7

not be because they're consistent with the text of the

8

statute, but simply because Congress has taken the

9

revenue rulings as a given and passed statutes that

10

effectively assumed that the revenue rulings are being

11

effective, as Justice Breyer pointed out.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have to acknowledge,

13

though, that if you read ­­ if you read the two sections

14

of the statute together, the one seems to be

15

unnecessary.

16
17
18

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, a couple points on that,

including benefits.

2

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first, just to pick up on

the textual point ­­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, there would have

4

been a way to fix the revenue rulings without doing it

5

this way.

6

without enacting a statute that contradicted itself?

7

Couldn't they have done it some other way

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

8

just to pick up on the textual point that Justice Alito,

9

I think, was adverting to earlier.

Saying that

10

particular types of payments shall be treated as if they

11

were wages made during a payroll period doesn't mean

12

that it's categorically impossible for such payments to

13

have qualified as wages to begin with.

14

As Judge Bryson pointed out in the ­­ his

15

opinion to the Federal Circuit in the CSX case, which is

16

cited in our briefs, if you were to say to treat all men

17

as if they were 6 feet tall, that wouldn't mean that no

18

man could possibly be 6 feet tall.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, unless it was in a

20

section that said how to treat men who are not 6 feet

21

tall.

withholding to certain payments other than wages."

The title of this section (o), "extension of

MR. FEIGIN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, your Honor, it says ­­
I mean, it ­­ it clearly

suggests that these are not wages.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

2

it says, "certain payments other than wages."

3

would point you to the part where it says, "treated as

4

wages for a payroll period."

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Second, I

Right.
And that actually has some

7

significance in that it allows the employer to treat

8

these as wages paid during the employer's normal payroll

9

period, so the withholding can be performed in the same

10

way that the employee would have withheld for normal

11

payroll period payment and avoids the need to apply the

12

rules that would govern in circumstances where payments

13

are made outside of a payroll period.

14

And these are payments that could well have

15

been made outside a normal payroll period, but this

16

directs that they be treated as payments within a

17

payroll period.

18

I would again point the Court back to the

19

historical reason why 3402(o) exists.

20

as I discussed earlier, following a suggestion by the

21

Treasury Department that there was a particular problem

22

with withholding that needed to be solved.

23

It was enacted,

Now, Justice Scalia, I suppose Congress

24

might have solved that problem in different ways, but I

25

think what Congress did here is it simply tried to solve

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the problem once and for all.

2

these payments should be treated as if they were wages

3

so that withholding would occur, thereby solving the

4

problem that the IRS identified.

It just declared that

5

And it enacted a definition of supplemental

6

unemployment compensation benefits that everyone agrees

7

is broader than the set of payments that the revenue

8

rulings up to that point had accepted.

9

couple of very good reasons Congress would have done it

10

And there are a

that way.

11

One is that, because of the IRS's

12

case­specific approach to each of its revenue rulings,

13

it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for

14

Congress to craft statutory language that precisely

15

captured the contours of the payments that the IRS

16

either was treating or might later treat as non­wages.

17

Second, again, the supplemental unemployment

18

benefit plans that had evolved in the 1950s continued to

19

evolve and take different forms.

20

just wanted to hedge against the possibility ­­ excuse

21

me.

22

that the IRS might later decide that a plan structured

23

slightly differently from any plan that it had

24

considered before should also be considered nonwages.

25

And I think the IRS

Congress wanted to hedge against the possibility

And there was absolutely no downside to

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress writing the definition in 3402(o)(ii)(a) more

2

broadly than the IRS rulings had thus far had an

3

opportunity to construe.

4

That's because, again as the Federal Circuit

5

pointed out, there is no practical harm done if you

6

treat ­­ if you are instructed to treat a particular

7

payment as wages and that payment already is wages.

8
9

Now, Your Honor, to your point about
surplusage, first of all, I don't think the canon

10

against surplusage would help you construe FICA here

11

because I think FICA is unambiguous.

12

I do not think there is any way to read the

13

definition, "remuneration for employment," considering

14

that it clearly includes separation­related payments, as

15

somehow again having a hole that is precisely the size

16

and shape of Section 3402(o)(2)(a).

17

In any event, the only way this would be

18

superfluous is if some court were to hold, on an issue

19

that is not presented to the Court in this case, that

20

the IRS has absolutely no administrative authority to

21

craft administrative exceptions to the definition of

22

wages for policy reasons, as it did in the revenue

23

rulings that underlie the enactment of Section 3402(o)

24

here.

25

If a court were to reach that conclusion,

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then Section 3402(o) might not have any operative

2

effect.

3

believed that the revenue rulings were ineffective or it

4

never would have enacted Section 3402(o) in the first

5

place.

6

thought that certain types of supplemental unemployment

7

benefits were excepted from the definition of "wages."

8

My friend on the other side mentioned these

9

But Congress in 1969 clearly could not have

There's no other reason Congress could have

1968 regulations.

Those regulations only applied to

10

payments from trusts.

11

like the payments at issue in this case, that come

12

directly from the employer.

13

purport to construe the definition of "wages" in either

14

FICA or the income tax withholding statutes.

15

fact, since 1957 there has been an income tax

17

payment on account of an employee's involuntary

separation does constitute wages for withholding

19

purposes.

20

21

They didn't apply to payments,

Those regulations did not

And in

And Congress was presumably aware of that

And again, I would just like to address one

22

final point.

23

this 1986 reenactment doesn't make a great deal of

24

sense.

25

reenacted the statute in 1986 it was somehow adopting

I think opposing counsel's argument about

I think the argument is that when Congress

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the then­current interpretation of the IRS in a 1977

2

revenue ruling.

3

I don't think that the enactment of Section

4

3402(o) originally in 1969 can be taken to have left the

5

IRS with sufficient flexibility to change its practices

6

during the 1970s, but that the reenactment of that very

7

same language in 1986 would be taken to freeze for all

8

time and ­­ the current IRS practices and foreclose the

9

IRS from ever modifying those practices in the future.

10

Finally, Respondents point to the

11

legislative history of 3402(o), which does contain some

12

statements that supplemental unemployment compensation

13

benefits aren't wages.

14

that legislative history is confusion about the

15

nomenclature.

16

I think some of the reason for

There were "supplemental unemployment

17

compensation benefits," which was a statutory term, and

18

"supplemental unemployment benefits," which was the term

19

the IRS used.

20

have been looking at the IRS revenue rulings, again

21

because there is simply nothing else that could have

22

possibly given the IRS the impression that any of these

23

types of payments weren't wages to begin with.

24

And I think it's very important that the

25

Court not just look at the legislative history

I think it is clear that Congress must

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

piecemeal, but look at the entire historical backdrop if

2

it decides to get into any of that at all.

3

this case is very easily resolved on the plain text of

4

FICA, which clearly includes these payments.

5

But we think

We don't even think there is a need to look

6

at Section 3402(o), which is limited in effect to the

7

income tax withholding provisions and was enacted to

8

solve a specific income tax withholding­related problem

9

and not to affect FICA's basic definition of wages.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about that we should

11

just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current

12

one, and just deal with the statute?

13

are suggesting?

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Is that what you

Well, the revenue rulings

15

aren't directly at issue in this case, Your Honor,

16

because all the revenue rulings do is specify that

17

certain payments ­­ not the type of payments that are

18

issued in this case ­­ are not wages.

19

And nobody contends that the revenue rulings

20

have any effect or any special bearing on this case,

21

because this is a case about payments that both the IRS

22

in its revenue rulings and Congress under the plain text

23

of FICA would classify as wages.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think part

of the ­­ the point is that the broad, capacious

34
Alderson Reporting Company

definition of "wages" at least doesn't seem as broad to

2

the IRS since they are carving things out, maybe not

3

willy­nilly, but at least they don't seem that it's as

4

broad as you do ­­ they don't seem to think that it's as

9

don't think the IRS was as careful about fidelity to

10

First, again, these exceptions first came into

text as a modern legal observer would be.

11

Second, if this Court were to believe that,

12

notwithstanding the fact that the IRS's revenue rulings

13

aren’t directly at issue in this case for the reasons I

14

said to Justice Ginsburg, if this Court believes that it

15

cannot rule for the Government in this case on the

16

statutory question without concluding that the revenue

17

rulings are invalid, we still think the Court should

18

rule for the Government on the statutory question.

19

We think the statutory text is clear, and

20

that is the IRS's position notwithstanding the revenue

21

rulings.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then what happens to

23

the State compensation schemes which the revenue rulings

24

seem to have been trying to accommodate?

25

MR. FEIGIN:

So if this Court were to

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conclude that the Government is correct on a ­­ as a

2

statutory matter, but we're to make clear that

3

revenue ­­ the current revenue ruling, Revenue Ruling

4

90­72 was invalid, that might have some effect on

5

individuals' eligibility for unemployment benefits under

6

State law in those States that incorporate the Federal

7

definition of wages as part of the calculation for

8

eligibility for State unemployment benefits.

9

If that creates any bad results, States will

10

be able to fix them, and I don't think that it should

11

preclude this Court from holding what the plain text of

12

FICA I think in this case requires.
