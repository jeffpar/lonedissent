ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Not even Mr. Hoeper can defend the decision

below and for good reason.

13

statute and consistent with this Court's First Amendment

14

precedence, truth matters, and airlines should not lose

15

their ATSA immunity, unless their statements are

16

materially false.

17

Under the plain terms of the

None of that is in dispute anymore.

Also not in dispute, I think, is that Air

18

Wisconsin was justified in picking up the phone, calling

19

TSA, and conveying certain core facts; namely, that

20

Mr. Hoeper was mad at the airline; that he was a Federal

21

flight deck officer or FFDO; that he had walked out on

22

his training, his last chance to keep his job; and he

23

was about to board a plane.

24

those facts are in dispute.

25

I don't believe any of

What is in dispute is how those facts were

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure.

not sure they ­­ they have conceded that.

12

MR. COHN:

I believe they have conceded,

13

Justice Scalia, that those facts could have been

14

conveyed, justifiably.

15

facts using different words, there would not be any

16

issue here.

17
18
19

If we had conveyed those core

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you could convey

anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that.
MR. COHN:

And the question, Justice Scalia,

20

is whether we framed or phrased the report in an

21

adequate manner.

22

question comes down to how much breathing space airlines

23

should be given in making these reports, how much room

24

there should be for permissible characterization and

25

expression in making these reports.

And in assessing that issue, the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And context should

Official

1

be kept in mind in answering that question, three things

2

in particular.

3

First, these reports are being made by

4

airline employees, such as pilots and flight attendants

5

and baggage handlers and ticket agents, who are being

6

told by TSA they have to report in realtime, without

7

investigation, without calling their lawyer, without

8

stopping to think on how to refine the perfect script,

9

and they are being told to do this based upon their

10

suspicions, in some cases, suspicions of other people's

11

emotions or state of mind.

12

context.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's one critical piece of

Well, Mr. Cohn, on the ­­
Can ­­ can we go back to

15

your response to Justice Scalia?

16

Respondents conceded, but ­­ but isn't it the case that

17

it was the Colorado supreme court that said that the

18

airline likely would have been immune if they had

19

phrased the report more cautiously?

20

MR. COHN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

You said that the

That's exactly right, Justice ­­
So it's ­­ it's the

Colorado supreme court, not the Respondent?
MR. COHN:

Well, I believe the Respondents

24

have also acknowledged that a call could have been made

25

conveying a certain fact.

You're completely correct,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg, that the Colorado supreme court said

2

we'd be likely immune if only we had used different

3

words, and those different words are immaterial.

4

lower court engaged in hairsplitting ­­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That

You had ­­ you're

6

saying ­­ you're saying there were three critical facts.

7

One is that these reports have to be made on suspicions

8

right away in realtime, by people like baggage handlers.

9

And your second point was?

10

MR. COHN:

The second point of context is

11

that these reports are being made to TSA and other

12

reasonable air safety officials, for the purpose of

13

passenger safety and aviation security.

14

the airlines, if you have any doubt, report; if you see

15

something, say something.

16

something ­­

17
18
19

And TSA tells

And if you don't say

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then the third?

And

your third?
MR. COHN:

And the third piece of context is

20

the consequences of a failure to make a report can be

21

catastrophic for passenger safety and aviation security.

22

And that's why TSA says, if you don't report

23

sincerely­held concerns, you might be sanctioned by us

24

for failing to make the report, placing airlines between

25

a rock and a hard place.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this context, it's not

2

clear to me what the issue is that's before us.

3

understanding is, is that there was no finding of

4

falsity.

5

defamatory.

6

false, I assume.

7

the jurors weren't instructed as to the definition of

8

"defamatory"?

9

My

Now, the jury was instructed that it had to be
Lawyers know that that means it has to be
And are you saying that ­­ you know,

Is that the point?

MR. COHN:

No, the issue is not about the

10

jury instructions, Justice Kennedy.

11

about the statutory immunity and the Aviation

12

Transportation Security Act, ATSA, and whether that

13

immunity requires a determination of whether or not the

14

statement was materially false.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. COHN:

17
18

The question's

By the court.
By the court in our view.

We

think, under any standard, we should prevail.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What ­­ what position ­­

19

although they'll tell us in a minute ­­ does Respondent

20

take on that issue that a determination by the jury

21

suffices?

22

for themselves in a few minutes.

23

As you understand their brief.

MR. COHN:

They can talk

I believe two things.

One, I

24

believe they concede the legal question that material

25

falsity is part of the ATSA analysis, and that's the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question on which this Court granted cert.

2

second question, which is not before the Court, is who

3

should decide this issue, the court or the jury?

4

I believe they feel the jury should answer

On the

5

that question.

6

the Court, but I think, on the issue that is before the

7

Court, they agree that material falsity is part of the

8

ATSA analysis.

9

Again, that issue is not strictly before

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't that implicit in

10

the instruction to the jury, that it has to be

11

defamatory?

12

judge ­­ the court has a duty to determine, as a matter

13

of law, at the outset, then that's something else.

14

Now, if you say, well, even if it is, the

MR. COHN:

Well, the jury ­­ and this is a

15

question of the jury instructions, which are not being

16

challenged, are not before the Court, but the jury was

17

not given instruction on materiality.

18

The jury, also, was not given instruction on

19

clear and convincing.

20

that the decision should be about what the effect would

21

be on TSA.

22

The jury shouldn't have answered that question.

23

They're not given instruction

So the jury didn't answer that question.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But ­­

But does defamatory require

24

that it be materially false?

25

with a statement in ­­ in which the derogatory

information is not material to anything at all, but it's

2

just derogatory?

3

MR. COHN:

Under the common law, Justice

4

Scalia, the statement has to be materially false.

5

agree with that.

6
7

And we also think that ­­

to sustain what?

8
9

We

MR. COHN:

To sustain a defamation judgment.

Of course, it depends upon State law, but generally,

under the common law, the statement has to be materially

11

false ­­

I mean, you can have

a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material

18

goes to, the particular reason that the statement is

19

made?

20

MR. COHN:

Is that what materiality

Mr. Chief Justice, that's a very

21

important distinction because, in the common law

22

context, you're concerned about the effect on the

23

person's reputation ­­ his general reputation in the

24

community, whereas, in the ATSA context, you're talking

25

about a very particular listener.

information about flight safety, that's somehow immune?

MR. COHN:

Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

statement might be deemed defamatory if you don't have

10

the ATSA immunity, but because of the ATSA immunity,

11

it's not materially false.

12

The

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you call some TSA

13

official and say this pilot ­­ you know, is having an

14

affair.

15

That's immune?

MR. COHN:

That would not be immune because

16

that would not be relevant to a suspicious transaction,

17

suspicious activity, or passenger safety, so ­­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

a defamation, wouldn't it?

20

MR. COHN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

But it would still support

Correct.

It would probably ­­

Because it is material to

the person's reputation.
MR. COHN:

Correct.

And it would not be

24

immune.

25

someone's having an affair, but, rather, the report we

But the report we had here is not that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

made is that someone might possibly be giving rise to a

2

concern.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, on the report that was

4

made here, suppose that the report said that the

5

Respondent ­­ we believe the Respondent is mentally ill,

6

or we believe the Respondent has serious mental

7

problems.

8

if that's what was said?

9
10

Would you ­­ would you make the same argument

MR. COHN:

With those words, I think I

would, Justice Alito, because ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. COHN:

You would?
The same argument, yes.

Now, I

13

think there are words that would cross the line.

14

don't believe those words do because ­­ a couple things.

15

First, the gist of the statement is still the same.

16

gist is this is a person who might possibly have a gun

17

and might possibly be in a state of mind ­­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

I

The

Well, the facts, as I

19

understand it, were that he became very angry during a

20

test ­­ during a flight simulation test.

21

his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset,

22

started cursing at the instructor, and then later,

23

he was ­­ he was showing anger and cursing for a period

24

of time in other parts of the facility.

25

Does it go beyond that?

11
Alderson Reporting Company

He took off

Is that fair?

Official

1

MR. COHN:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's a fair characterization.
All right.

And you think,

3

based on that, you could say, we believe this man is

4

mentally ill?

5

MR. COHN:

Justice Alito, I'm keeping in

6

mind the first important piece of context, which is

7

these reports are being made by tens of thousands of

8

aviation employees on the ground that could have

9

different educations and socioeconomic backgrounds and

10

might not all speak the way we do, especially in an

11

uncertain context in which the facts are rapidly

12

evolving.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

14

difficult about simply saying he's angry?

15

the word "mentally unstable"?

16

to connote something more than the facts?

17

MR. COHN:

What's so
Why choose

Isn't it with an intent

A couple things, Justice

18

Sotomayor.

19

the gist of the statement is the same.

20

to draw the connotations, the implications ­­

21

First, it's not ­­ the question is whether

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's up to TSA

Well, yes, but from

22

facts.

23

someone's angry and someone's mentally ill ­­

So isn't there a difference between saying

24

MR. COHN:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think ­­
­­ has a mental problem

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or is mentally unstable?

2

intent is to convey something else?

3

MR. COHN:

Don't you think that the

Justice Sotomayor, I think that

4

different people express the same thought in different

5

ways.

6

attendant in LaGuardia might use different words, such

7

as "he lost it," "he went off the deep end," "he was

8

acting irrationally," "he blew up."

9

I think a baggage handler in Boston or a flight

And the lower court said ­­

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, you could say he's

11

nuts, but the question isn't whether somebody would say

12

it.

13

mere fact that ­­ that a lot of people will ­­ will

14

exaggerate and say things that are simply not true

15

doesn't make it okay.

16

MR. COHN:

The question is whether that is false.

I mean, the

Justice Scalia, a couple things

17

in response.

18

there's a simple statement and the person hangs up.

19

There's a conversation with TSA, in this case, a

20

10­minute conversation, in which they probe behind the

21

facts and they found out what happened, that Mr. Hoeper

22

was angry and upset and he blew up that morning at

23

training.

24
25

First, this is not a situation in which

And second, the lower court recognized this
and said, if we simply had used "irrational and blew

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

up," we'd be immune, as opposed to saying "mentally

2

ill."

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the point is that

4

somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or

5

whatever it was, was material, whether ­­ whether it

6

would have made any difference to TSA if it had been

7

described otherwise.

8

it, as ­­ as the Colorado supreme court said, nobody has

9

made that determination; right?

10

And in this case, as I understand

The Colorado supreme court says it doesn't

11

make any difference whether ­­ whether it would have

12

affected TSA or not, putting it ­­ putting it the proper

13

way, right?

14
15
16

MR. COHN:

Correct, Justice Scalia,

absolutely correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that's what we're

17

confronted with, simply, the ­­ the need for somebody to

18

make that factual determination, right?

19

saying what?

20

And you're

There's no need to make it at all?

MR. COHN:

Oh, no, no, Justice Scalia, we

21

say that there is a need to make that determination.

22

The lower court said no need, material falsity is not

23

part of the ATSA analysis.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

"material"?

Where did it say

I thought ­­ I thought ­­ I think, so far

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or

2

falsity of the statement.

3

Colorado supreme court should have said it has to be

4

false.

And you're saying that the

Isn't that your argument?

5

MR. COHN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

They had to say it.
Okay.

Now, I've looked

7

at ­­ I've looked at footnote 17 ­­ or footnote 6 or

8

whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their

9

characterization of the Colorado supreme court is right;

10

that is, the Colorado supreme court is going to be very

11

surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to

12

be false.

13

What they said here is, "In the

14

determination of immunity, we need not and, therefore,

15

do not decide whether the statements were true or

16

false."

17

Correct.

Why not?

Because, they say, "The trial

18

court properly submitted the case to the jury.

19

Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the

20

elements of a defamation claim, including whether the

21

statements were false."

22

So, as I read that, which I think you'll

23

hear from the other side in about ­­ a few minutes,

24

the ­­ the Colorado supreme court says, look, the jury

25

found that the statement was false, so we don't have to

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

worry about that, we're worried about whether the false

2

statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth

3

or falsity or knowledge that it was false.

4

That's how I read the footnote.

Okay?
And they

5

say something like that on ­­ on page 30 and 31 of their

6

brief.

7

So ­­ so if I'm right about that, what are

8

we supposed to do?

9

of truth or falsity are not for the jury?

Are we supposed to say that matters
Are we

10

supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any

11

reasonable person would go ­­ would do here?

12

we're supposed to do?

13

MR. COHN:

What is it

Justice Breyer, the lower court

14

recognized that the ATSA immunity question is for the

15

court to decide.

16

material falsity, to the jury, they said it's not part

17

of the ATSA immunity analysis, and that's error.

18

should ­­

19

And because they left that issue,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

But did the jury ­­ did

20

the jury find falsity?

21

jury find that the statement was, as you say, materially

22

false?

23
24
25

MR. COHN:

Do you recognize that?

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Did this

The jury

did make that determination, but ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how did ­­ how did

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

they make it?

2

special verdict sheet and it doesn't ask that question.

3

Because the only thing I see is the

MR. COHN:

Correct.

What the jury did,

4

first of all ­­ first of all, it shouldn't have gone to

5

the jury because it's part of the ATSA immunity

6

analysis, which is for the court to decide.

7

But, second, the jury did not ask whether or

8

not our statement would have a different effect on TSA,

9

which is the proper test here.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are two ­­ there are

11

two different issues of falsity that we're talking about

12

here, of materiality.

13

it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable

14

when all that he did was lose his temper.

15

my view of it.

16

One is the defamation issue, and

Okay?

That's

That does not answer the question of whether

17

calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his

18

temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have

19

produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the

20

airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper,

21

he's been fired from his job, he may have a ­­ he may

22

have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was

23

mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to

24

take him off the flight.

25

There are two different questions.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Materiality for defamation is ­­ is quite different from

2

the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity

3

under this Act.

4

but the former is for the jury, it seems to me.

5

The latter question is for the court,

MR. COHN:

I agree completely, Justice

Scalia.

answer ­­ well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd
like an answer to my question.
MR. COHN:

My answer, Justice Breyer, to

12

your question is that the jury answered a different

13

question.

14

material under defamation law, not whether it's material

15

to TSA as required by ATSA and that determination should

16

not go to the jury, that's for the court to decide.

17

And the lower court said, I'm not going

They answered a question about whether it's

18

to ­­ we're not going to address that question, we're

19

not going to address it because it's not part of ATSA,

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. FEIGIN:

2

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

It's essentially undisputed that, in order

4

to encourage airlines to report suspicious activity to

5

proper authorities, the ATSA immunizes such reports when

6

they're materially true.

7

points about the scope of that immunity.

8
9

I want to emphasize two main

First, ATSA gives airlines very wide
latitude in how they describe the suspicious activities.

10

These reports are made against an inherently uncertain

11

factual backdrop, and that's why the statute protects

12

reports of any suspicious transaction relevant to a

13

possible violation of law or regulation relating to air

14

safety.

15

only because of confusion about the facts, but because

16

of the emotion, the stress, and potentially even the

17

fear that may go along with making one of these reports.

18

Misconceptions and exaggerations can occur, not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Feigin, do you think

19

that the statute, 44941, was intended by the Congress to

20

incorporate the New York Times­Sullivan standard, the

21

Masson v. New Yorker standard?

22

And ­­ and if so, then it ­­ it seems to me

23

that the airline is under a duty more strict than the

24

one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's

25

counsel has explained.

19
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

2

there's a distinction between Masson and this case.

3

Masson follows the more general defamation law rule

4

about whether a statement is materially false in terms

5

of a person's reputation, whereas, here, the focus is on

6

what a reasonable security official would believe.

7

And we think that's fairly seen in the text

8

of the statute, which, again, protects statements about

9

any suspicious transaction relevant to possible

10

violation of law or regulation.

11

So what the statements are intended to

12

convey is a suspicion of a possible threat, and the gist

13

in this context, what has to be true in this context, is

14

the suspicion of the possible threat.

15

emphasize that because the statute talks about

16

suspicions and possibilities, that the actual factual

17

basis for what's reported doesn't need to be

18

particularly strong.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, I want to

So ­­ so you want us to

20

write an opinion to say that the ­­ that the statute

21

here is to be interpreted differently than if it were a

22

New York Times and Sullivan case or Masson­New Yorker

23

case?

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

only real difference is the context.

20
Alderson Reporting Company

I think, in

Official

1

Masson, you were talking about readers of a general

2

interest magazine, The New Yorker Magazine, whereas,

3

here, the audience for these reports is much more

4

specialized.

5

receiving reports of suspicious activity.

6

It's law enforcement officers who are

Now, they're not interested in someone's

7

reputation as a general matter.

8

in is what kind of threat the person might pose and what

9

might happen to an airplane in the next period of time

10

What they're interested

that they have to worry about.

11

And I think it's particularly important that

12

the Court give wide latitude to statements in this

13

context because there's a substantially similar

14

provision that protects individuals who make reports to

15

law enforcement authorities.

16

That's in 6 U.S.C. 1104.

And I think it would be very unfortunate if

17

someone responding to the TSA's ubiquitous "See

18

Something, Say Something" campaign were to inadvertently

19

or recklessly, as later concluded by a jury, have some

20

sort of exaggeration about what they were reporting and

21

then find themselves liable for civil damages, just for

22

trying to ­­

25

I accept that for the
What's bothering me, a picky

1

of the question, whether ATSA immunity may be denied

2

without a determination that the air carrier's

3

disclosure was materially false?

4

read the footnote, footnote 6, last sentence, it says

5

there was such a determination, the jury made it, and we

6

don't have to go back over it.

7

So what are you arguing?

No, can't be.

But I

Are you arguing

8

that there should be like, as there is in free speech

9

cases ­­ you know, a special duty upon an appellate

10

court to go back over such a jury finding?

11

saying the Colorado supreme court was wrong in the

12

second part of footnote 6 when it says the jury made it?

Are you

13

What am I supposed to do, in your opinion.

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, what you're supposed to

15

do in this case, Your Honor, is that the jury ­­ the

16

finding that the jury made ­­ first of all, the jury

17

wasn't actually instructed on materiality ­­

18

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

They may have waived it ­­

you know.
MR. FEIGIN:

But assuming, for the sake of

21

argument, the jury found the statements were materially

22

false, it only did so in the context of the State law

23

defamation verdict.

24

as I tried to explain earlier, there's a difference

25

between materiality from the perspective of someone's

And as Justice Scalia explained and

JUSTICE ALITO:

My understanding of what the

Colorado supreme court did is this:

5

ATSA immunity, it said, very clearly, that is for the

6

court.

7

no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to

8

the facts that it found on the immunity question.

9

And then, at the end of footnote 6, what it

10

said was, having found that there is no immunity, then

11

it was proper for the trial judge to submit the

12

defamation issue to the jury, and the jury made findings

13

on the defamation issue.

well?
MR. FEIGIN:

That's my understanding of the

supreme court of Colorado's opinion, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And are they right that, in

19

determining ATSA immunity, the jury has no role, doesn't

20

make findings of historical fact, who said what,

21

anything like that?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

23

this is encompassed within the question presented, but

24

our view, as we explain in footnote 6 of our brief, is

25

that, under ATSA, questions of historical facts, such as

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

what was actually said on the call and what actually

2

happened, would be submitted to the jury.

Materiality is a mixed question of law and

6

making clear the very wide latitude that airlines have

7

in this context.

9

We believe that, also, it should be submitted to

in this context, we think, very often, the courts will

be able to get rid of these kinds of cases at the motion

Then you disagree with

MR. FEIGIN:

Again, Your Honor, we don't

think the Court needs to address it here.

22

think a jury would resolve the materiality question

23

under the ATSA ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We actually

2

having found that it is defamatory, you must make a

3

second materiality finding, namely, would this

4

defamatory statement have caused TSA ­­ if it had been

5

accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it

6

did, not have removed this man from the flight?

7
8

You're going to give the jury those two
instructions on materiality?

9

MR. FEIGIN:

We do think the court should

10

give the jury separate instructions on ATSA, and then,

11

if it passes the ATSA bar, you'd go on to defamation

12

law.

13

too hard if it wants to say that this is a question for

14

the Court.

15
16
17

But, Your Honor, I'm not going to fight the Court

What I'd really like to emphasize here is

MR. FEIGIN:

I mean, you don't

What ­­ what is your view?

Your Honor, we are comfortable

23

with the Court saying that it's a question for the

court.

25

question for the jury.

Our reading of the statute is that it would be a
There'd be an instruction, as

25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there was in this case, although not a proper

2

instruction, on all the elements of ATSA, with the court

3

making the law very clear to the jury that it has to

4

apply for ATSA.

5
6
7

And then, if the jury gets past that, they
would get a separate set of instructions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, you

8

don't ­­ there's no reason ­­ and, presumably, a good

9

trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two

10

separate questions using the same word, right?

11

you could articulate what you mean by "material" in ­­

12

in each context.

13

I mean,

In other words, you don't have to say it

14

would be material to TSA.

15

colleague has suggested, whether or not TSA would have

16

done anything different if a different formulation had

17

been used.

18

MR. FEIGIN:

It would say just, as my

That's right, Your Honor.

I

19

think you could ask how TSA would have understood the

20

statement with their particular eye towards the

21

suspicion of a possible threat that's being conveyed.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you'd ­­ you'd feel

23

snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines,

24

knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is

25

going to be up to some jury who is going to see that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you're really concerned

10

whether you put it wrongly or not, and if you're putting

11

it wrongly, it would have made a difference, it doesn't

12

make me happy.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I think what's

14

going to provide the adequate good feelings that

15

airlines have making these reports, to make them feel

16

safe making these reports, is for this Court to

17

emphasize the very wide scope that the ATSA gives to how

18

airlines characterize ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Feigin, they have

20

that wide scope because of the actual malice standard,

21

that somebody needs to show that there was actual

22

knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to

23

falsity.

24
25

And you're saying that we should do
something different.

You're saying that we should

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expand what falsity means in this context as a sort of

2

extra protection, and I guess why is that true?

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

4

we're doing anything different from the actual malice

5

standard, except taking account of the context.

6

particular context, where there's a lot of factual

7

uncertainty, a lot of emotion mixed in, and the audience

8

aren't readers of, for example, a general interest

9

magazine, they are security officials looking for

In this

10

suspicion of a possible threat, we think that the scope

11

of the materiality test is very broad.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two sets of questions before the

20

Court here.

21

interpretation of ATSA and maybe some subsidiary

22

questions about the division of authority between judge

23

and jury and what the materiality standard is.

24

there's a question about what to do with this case.

25

those two sets of things should be considered

There's a legal question about the proper

28
Alderson Reporting Company

And then
And

Official

1

differently because much of what's being argued here

2

today was not presented to the lower courts.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So suppose I'm the trial

4

judge and I conclude that, if Air Wisconsin had said to

5

the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier

6

question, We have an employee who was terminated today,

7

he probably knew it, he lost his temper during a test,

8

he might think that some of our employees are out to get

9

him, and there may even be some truth to that, he's

10

authorized to carry a gun, we don't know if he has one

11

or not, we're giving you that information.

12

Suppose I'm the trial judge.

I conclude

13

that, if that information had been given to TSA, TSA

14

quite properly stopped this plane to examine the pilot.

15

Do I send the case to the jury?

16

MR. RUSSELL:

Let me unpack that.

I think

17

there is three parts to that question.

18

implicit in that is ATSA immunity factual questions for

19

the court or for the jury?

20

government that you should apply the ordinary qualified

21

25

29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

The second question is what is the

2

materiality standard.

3

that the standard is would TSA have done the same thing

4

anyway?

5

that that's not the right test because we can't know,

6

because TSA won't tell us.

7

Justice Scalia, you've suggested

And I take the government even to be saying

TSA has to keep secret its procedures about

8

what it would do and when.

does he, nonetheless, get immunity because what he said

19

So who decides?

MR. RUSSELL:

Is it ­­ is it the court or

I think that the answer to the

20

legal question is that you have the same division that

you have in qualified immunity, that material disputes

reviews those ­­ those findings under the normal ­­

same way.

3

I still have to submit this to the jury?

MR. RUSSELL:

If ­­ if you think that

there's no disputes about those facts, that no

5

reasonable jury could conclude otherwise on those facts,

6

and you think ­­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, I thought that, even

8

9

they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate.

Can't I make that

determination as a matter of law?
MR. RUSSELL:

I don't ­­ I think the

18

what the standard of materiality is, and it's not

19

whether TSA would have acted differently.

But there's also ­­ I also want to make clear

20

It's whether TSA would have had a different

21

impression about facts that are undoubtedly material to

22

their determination, not only about the extent of the

23

threat, but also what to do in the immediate aftermath.

24

get­go, not only whether to investigate or not, but

4

MR. RUSSELL:

I think it has to make a

difference in the way that they would evaluate the

existence, nature, or extent of the threat, and so it ­­

you know, it wouldn't make a difference to the way that

I'm not sure what all the this is true, this is true,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So other than proving at

trial that these statements were misleadingly false ­­

3

or false, how did you prove that the statements would

4

have had an effect on a reasonable security officer?

5

MR. RUSSELL:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let me ­­ sure.
How do you ­­ what's the

7

evidence that you expect parties to present and what was

8

it you presented to show that their response would have

9

been different?

10

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, let me ask ­­ answer the

11

second question first, which is we had an expert witness

12

who was formerly in charge of writing security

13

regulations for TSA and the FAA before that who

14

testified that, in light of the truth, a call wasn't

15

even warranted, but that he perfectly understood why TSA

16

acted the way it did, given the contents of the call.

17
18

Now, this wasn't a focus because nobody made
the argument that this could be a materially false ­­

this:

Your side will get the

And on that one, you

But is there ­­ is there ­­ what do you

10

think of that procedure?

11

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I definitely think that

12

it would be appropriate for this Court to write an

13

opinion that says, look, to the extent footnote 6

14

suggests that some true statements aren't protected by

15

ATSA, that's wrong.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it doesn't say that.

17

It says ­­ footnote 6 has to be read with footnote 5,

18

which I hadn't picked up.

19

footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado

20

supreme court says.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

And once I put those two

Well, I think you can say,

22

look, we don't know what it means, but to the extent it

23

means that ATSA doesn't affect all true statements,

24

that's wrong.

25

three courts ­­ Colorado courts affirmed, that the

But in this case, the jury found ­­ and

40
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

statements weren't true.
And, Justice Ginsburg, there was an

3

instruction to the jury, and in Instruction No. 9 at

4

page 579 of the Joint Appendix, I have been told the

5

jury, that to enter a verdict, they had to find that the

6

statement was false.

7

So the jury found that that was false.

On

8

appellate review, two courts of appeals found that there

9

was sufficient evidence for that, even though they

10

didn't ask for a materiality instruction.

11

courts resolved every material falsity claim or every

12

materiality objection that AWAC actually raised, in the

13

context in which it actually raised it, which was

14

whether we had satisfied our version ­­ burden to prove

15

the elements of common law defamation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think it would have been

true for them to say, look, we're calling to let you

know, because Mr. Hoeper's an FFDO, we don't have any

23

reason to believe that he has gun with him, but we can't

24

tell for sure, so we just thought we would tell you, in

25

case you have any questions and want to investigate

42
Alderson Reporting Company

further.
By not saying ­­ by not qualifying "may be

3

armed" with the statement that "we have no reason at all

4

to believe that he actually has a gun," which is the

5

truth, I think they gave a very different impression ­­

6

and Mr. LaWare, for example, the vice president who made

7

the decision to make the call, testified that, if he had

8

been told, as a pilot, that a mentally unstable person

9

who may have a gun was boarding his plane, it would make

10

him very concerned about the safety of his crew and

11

passengers.

12

This is at JA 271 to 272.

And as a consequence, he said those aren't

13

the words I would have anticipated being used because he

14

recognized, as somebody in the industry, what effect

15

those words would have on a reasonable security person.

16

So that ­­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you're talking about a

18

very subtle implication of the statement.

19

with you, there's an implication there that may not be

20

justified, but you're talking about something very

21

subtle in ­­ in the context of ­­ of someone making a

22

call to report a possible threat.

MR. RUSSELL:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then the final

10

thing, I guess, was the same thing Justice Scalia had in

11

mind, was that he's unstable.

12

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, "Mentally unstable."

And

13

that's ­­ you know, this Court has used the phrase

14

"mentally unstable" as a shorthand for describing people

15

who are subject to involuntary commitment, and people

16

who are barred by Federal law from owning a gun.

17

are trigger words in ­­ in this context.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that ­­

Well, you're not

didn't mean to be facetious about it.

I'm sorry.

I

But I­­ the point is

10

that whether they said "unstable" or "mentally

11

unstable," everybody understood it was the same thing,

12

and it had the same implication, which is very serious.

13
14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they didn't ­­ they

said, we were concerned about his mental stability.
MR. RUSSELL:

They said that, but they also

16

said he is unstable.

17

when you couple those together, even if they just said

18

they were concerned, I think that would be false and

19

misleading, in part, because they weren't.

20

They said, "unstable pilot."

I mean, we had testimony.

And

We asked them,

21

"Did you think that Mr. Hoeper was mentally unstable?"

22

And Mr. Orozco said, "I don't believe he was mentally

23

unstable."

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wouldn’t you think it makes

a difference we're talking here about a pilot?

45
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official

1

my impression of pilots is that they are supposed to

2

remain perfectly calm, even when terrible things happen.

3

Well, all the ­­ you know, all engines are on fire and

4

one of the wings has fallen off, but ­­ you know, you

5

don't start ranting and screaming.

6

And so someone described him as acting in a

7

manner that was more unprofessional than they had ever

8

seen.

9

Do you think that makes a difference?
MR. RUSSELL:

I think you could take that

10

into account, but you also have to recognize that,

11

hopefully, this wouldn't be the same because most people

12

don't get treated as unfairly as Mr. Hoeper was.

13

And I think there is abundant evidence for

14

the jury to conclude that he was acting with ­­ maybe not the

15

best way, but he was acting within the ­­ the spectrum

16

of normal human reaction to being treated that unfairly,

17

with respect to something that important.

18
19
20

JUSTICE ALITO:

But maybe for ordinary

people, but how about for pilots?
MR. RUSSELL:

I think even for pilots.

For

21

example, Mr. Sherman, who is a pilot, who's trained in

22

spotting threats, testified ­­ he's the one who got

23

yelled at ­­ testified that, when he left the training

24

center, he didn't think that Mr. Hoeper was acting

25

irrationally, he didn't think that he was a threat.

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

He was shocked to learn that calls to TSA

2

had actually been made.

3

briefly before he boarded the flight, and he knew, at

4

that point, that he was an FFDO, he was a pilot, he knew

5

about the last chance letter, he knew about the prior

6

incidents of pilots taking down airplanes.

7

him, go ahead, get on the flight.

And Mr. Orozco talked to him

And he told

8

There really isn't ­­ these are the people

9

who would know what is surprising and concerning about

10

the conduct of our client in this case, and none of them

11

were willing to say that he was, in fact, mentally

12

unstable, and that's telling.

13

You know, even if they are willing to say

14

now, through their lawyers, that they had concerns about

15

his mental stability, the fact that they weren't willing

16

to say that he was mentally unstable shows that they

17

recognized that there's a material difference between

18

those two statements.

19

Otherwise, they would have said, yes, he was

20

mentally unstable because we had concerns about his

21

mental stability.

22

And that's the same thing.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All of us have had the

23

experience ­­ at least I have, of ­­ if I get very angry

And what's worrying me is ­­ is that some

3

real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and

4

the people are going to report it to the TSA, start

5

watching their words and they don't know what the

6

lawyers mean exactly ­­ and you understand the problem.

7

MR. RUSSELL:

leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's

12

means is they are going to search him more thoroughly.

13

MR. RUSSELL:

All it

There is enormous leeway

14

already, and that is in the actual malice standard.

15

16

so long as he doesn't suspect that it's untrue, he has

17

immunity, even if it's grossly untrue.

the ­­ that's, I think, one of the reasons why ­­ and

19

you have that protection under the First Amendment to

start with.

So

And that's

21

And that's one of the reasons why we're able

22

to identify only six cases, and this is one of them, in

24

anybody's even cited this provision in an opinion,

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's because the protection that's

ample protection for people who are acting in good

faith.

an application of the Masson standard, which is if you

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, certainly, what they do

with the information is reflective of the effect it has

21

there was a basis for concluding that TSA would have

23

And that's because, as I said before, we had

for two­and­a­half hours after receiving this

20

information before making the call.

Part of

But even when ­­ having waited as long as

2

they did, they could have asked somebody on the airplane

3

to just go and ask him and talk to him and see if there

4

was reason to believe that there was something amiss

5

that would require going back to the gate.

6

Now, I acknowledge that, again, because the

7

call was so late, there really wasn't a ton that could

8

be done, but that's not a reason to give them greater

9

leeway.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you want us to say the

11

call has to be made right away, without reflection,

12

without talking to supervisors, without some quiet

discussion first?

15

That's what you want us to put in the

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

I mean, TSA has told people,

17

that Mr. Doyle's conduct, in which he wasn't consulting

18

with supervisors ­­ he did nothing during that

19

two­and­a­half hours that would reflect that he had an

20

actual concern about mental stability or danger here.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so we do think

I thought I read

22

somewhere that, after this incident, there was a

23

discussion between or among Mr. Doyle and various

24

government agencies to figure out how to avoid something

25

like this in the future.

I don't think he gave any

But,

10

something like this to happen again because ­­ you know,

11

when somebody is given false information that ­­

12

particularly when it leads to an elevated response that

13

wouldn't have been necessary under a proper report, that

14

gives rise to security concerns and dangers in itself.

15

When you send armed men onto a plane full of

16

nervous people, in close quarters, who don't know what's

17

going on, and officers who believe that there may be a

18

man on the gun ­­ with a gun, who's mentally unstable on

19

the plane, that is a recipe for danger and for

20

accidental things to happen and for people to get hurt,

21

in addition to diverting attention from things that

22

might be actual more ­­ more serious incidents that

23

are going on at the same time.

24
25

Congress didn't think that the way to
promote airline security here is simply to give carte

Alderson Reporting Company

blanche immunity to anybody who reports anything about

2

suspicious activity, if they thought they could have

3

ended at subsection A.

4

there's a balance and that people who make bad­faith

5

reports that are materially untrue ought not to be

6

immune, recognizing that there might be some deterrent

7

effect at the margins, but acknowledging the need to

8

strike this balance.

Instead, they recognized that

9

And in this case ­­ whatever you end up

10

doing in this case, and I would like to come back,

11

before I leave, to this point, that this case has been

12

litigated up the chain, without any request for

13

ATSA­specific materiality instruction, with the court

14

addressing every material truth objection that was

15

actually made in the context in which it was made.

16

And it's important to point out that they

17

never, even when they argued material truth, argued that

18

mentally unstable ­­ or were concerned about mental

19

instability was materially true.

20

The only argument they ever made about

21

that ­­ and you can read it at the appendix to the Red

22

Brief, was that this was a protected statement of

23

opinion because it could not be true or false.

24

there's a world of difference between saying that

25

something isn't true or false and saying that it is

56

And

true.

2

Because to determine whether it's protected

3

opinion, you only have to look at the statement to

4

determine whether it's substantially true.

5

look at the evidence.

6

very least, they have not preserved any argument that

7

the statement "mentally unstable" was materially true.

You have to

And so they have not ­­ at the

8

So, at the end of the day, we think that you

9

can satisfy the government's need for clarity about what

10

the legal standard is by simply saying ATSA protects

11

true statements, full stop, but, nonetheless, affirming

12

this case ­­ the opinion in this case on the ground that

13

the Colorado court asked whether these statements were

14

true and said that there was sufficient evidence that

15

they were not and resolved every materiality objection

16

that they actually made in the course of their opinion.

17

The fact that they did it under a different

18

subheading, that they asked the right question under the

19

wrong subheading, isn't a ground for reversal in this

20

case.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you add to the

22

question ­­ the question in this case was put by the

23

Court ­­ the question whether ATSA immunity may be

24

denied without a determination the air carrier's

25

disclosure was material and false?

The answer to that question is

no, with the caveat that an appellate court has no

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Two very quick points:

First, the mixed

12

question, the application of law to facts most certainly

13

should be decided by the court, not the jury just like

14

this Court held in Muehler v. Mena or Nellis and Congus.

15

The historical facts are a separate

16

question, but the ultimate question of materiality is

17

one that should be decided by the ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how do we decide

what a reasonable security officer would do?

20

MR. COHN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do we decide it?
How does ­­ how ­­ how

22

do we as judges?

I'm not sure how juries would do it,

MR. COHN:

should resolve it, just like they resolve issues of

reasonable force and probable cause.

4

judgment and common sense, in light of the broad leeway

5

that TSA should be given in answering these questions,

7

earliest possible stage.

levels of ­­ of force that we can say, as a matter of

20

But when have we said that what might be excessive to

MR. COHN:

According ­­ Nellis said the

ultimate question is for a court to decide.

25

point is, first of all, the lower court here said the

Alderson Reporting Company

But our

Official

1

question is for a court to decide for ATSA immunity.

2

But under any standard, we should still prevail because

3

the matter of law, the statement here simply is

4

immaterial.

Falsity ­­ the alleged falsity is

5

immaterial.

Under any standard, the Court should hold,

6

as a matter of law, the standard here is immaterial.

8

is the Court should address that application question in

9

this case because airlines need guidance.

clarity.

11

They need

They need predictability on what the law is.

And right now, there's no predictability

12

because the lower court held that hairsplitting

13

distinctions make a difference, that the difference

14

between fire today and fire tomorrow is a material

15

difference.

16

hairsplitting distinctions do not make a difference.

17

And the Court should make clear those

a different kind of thing?

24

case?

and mental state or rationality or blow up.
