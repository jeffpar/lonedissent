ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

It is common ground between the parties in

12

this case that Section 101, by its terms, and with the

13

sweeping interpretation this Court adopted in Bilski

14

applies directly to the patents here.

15

and process patents that speak directly to Section 101.

16

These are system

The only issue, then, is whether the

17

Judicially­recognized exception that this Court adopted

18

many, many years ago applies under these circumstances.

19
20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And just repeat, it is

common ground between the parties that ­­
MR. PHILLIPS:

That ­­ that our ­­ our

22

patents speak directly to the language of Section 101,

23

that is, they are a process, and they are machines, and

24

they are ­­ and they are improvements to the process and

25

the machines.

They don't ­­ they don't dispute that by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

its terms 101 applies.

2

parties is the abstract idea exception that exists and

3

whether that bars us from otherwise satisfying

4

Section 101.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The only argument between the

Mr. Phillips, on the

6

abstract idea, you know that the Bilski case held that

7

hedging qualified as an abstract idea.

8

intermediate settlement a less abstract than hedging?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

So how is

If our ­­ if our patent

10

merely claimed intermediated settlements, although I

11

have to say I don't really know exactly what that means

12

because I don't think that's the same kind of

13

economics ­­ basic economics concept that a hedge risk

14

treatment is.

15

wouldn't have a distinction from Bilski.

16

But if it claimed that, we wouldn't ­­ we

What we claim is a very specific way of

17

dealing with a problem that came into being in the early

18

1970s of how to try to eliminate the risk of

19

non­settlement in these very massive multiparty problems

20

in which you need to deal with difficulties that exist

21

at different time zones simultaneously and to do it with

22

a computer so that you not only take them on

23

chronologically, deal with them sequentially, based on

24

the kind software analysis that the patent specifically

25

describes by function.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

And it goes even further than that, and does

2

something that no escrow agent and ­­ and no

3

intermediated settlement that I know of ­­ settler that

4

I know of.

5

that, in the shadow account, would violate the terms of

6

the settlement that would ultimately be implemented.

7

It actually blocks specific transactions

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me put it this

8

way.

9

class in engineering and said here's ­­ here's my idea,

If you describe that to a second­year college

10

now you go home and you program over this weekend, my

11

guess is ­­ my guess is that that would be fairly easy

12

to program.

13
14
15

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't disagree with it,

Justice ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the fact that the

16

computer is involved, it ­­ it seems to me, is necessary

17

to make it work.

18

is certainly not in the creation of the program to make

19

that work.

20

the word ­­ an "idea."

21
22

But the ­­ but the innovative aspect

All you're talking about is ­­ if I can use

MR. PHILLIPS:
for obvious reasons.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

I prefer not to use that word

But ­­ but if you ­­ but if

you look at the Solicitor ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or ­­ or a method or a

process.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But ­­ and ­­ and

4

obviously, methods and processes are precisely what

5

Section 101 permits ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Why is that less abstract?
I'm sorry?
Why is that less abstract?

I mean, imagine King Tut sitting in front of the pyramid

10

where all his gold is stored, and he has the habit of

11

giving chits away.

Good for the gold, which is given at

12

the end of the day.

And he hires a man with an abacus,

13

and when the abacus keeping track sees that he's given

14

away more gold than he is in storage, he says, stop.

15

You see?

16

Or my mother, who used to look at my

17

checkbook, when she saw that, in fact, I had written

18

more checks than I had in the account, she would grab

19

it.

20

Stop.

You see?

So what is it here that's less abstract that

21

the computer says, stop?

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is ­­
How is that less abstract

24

than King Tut, if we had the same thing with a grain

25

elevator, if we had the same thing with a reservoir of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

water, if we had the same thing with my checkbook?

2

see the point.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

You

I do see the point, Justice

4

Breyer, and it seems to me that it goes to the question

5

of the methodology you're going to employ.

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Methodology is just as

you said, stop.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, we could ­­
So what we have different

10

here is the computer stops rather than the abacus man

11

stopping or my mother stopping or the guy that the grain

12

elevator has that says stop.

13

that it?

14

have an invention.

15

stop, you don't?

16

So just saying, what ­­ is

In other words, if you say, computer stop, you
Useful add ­­ but if you say, mother

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Well, I mean, again, it

17

seems to me that in some ways what ­­ what you described

18

there is a caricature of what this invention is.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course it's a

20

caricature.

21

there is an abstract idea here.

It's a caricature designed to suggest that

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's called solvency.

But ­­
And what you do is you take

24

the idea of solvency and you say apply it.

25

apply it through the computer.

Alderson Reporting Company

And you say

Official

8
1

Is that enough to make it not just the

2

abstract idea?

3

my exaggerated examples ­­

And now we're at the heart of why I used

4

MR PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Right.
­­ because you will tell me

why ­­

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
­­ this is enough.
Right.

Because, Justice

10

Breyer, the ­­ the ­­ the concept here is not simply to

11

say stop.

12

Stop is obviously part of the element of it.

But it's also designed to ensure that at the

13

end of the day, this transaction, in the midst of

14

literally a global set of ­­ of deals that are going on

15

simultaneously, will be implemented at the appropriate

16

time in the appropriate way.

17

be, it seems to me it's difficult to say that's an

18

abstract idea as implemented.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And whatever else that may

I'm sorry.

But ­­ but

20

what it appears to be, it sounds like you're trying to

21

revive the patenting of a function.

22

"function" earlier, and that's all I'm seeing in this

23

patent is the function of reconciling accounts, the

24

function of making sure they're paid on time.

25

what particular way, other than saying do it through a

Alderson Reporting Company

You used the word

But in

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it does it through ­­

4

for security.

5

somebody to enter into a central bank's own accounts.

6

You create the shadow accounts.

7

software that allows you to do that.

8

of the transactions to ensure that the settlement will

9

be available.

You don't ­­ you're not going to allow

You monitor through the
You evaluate each

You do it sequentially, and you act on it

10

by the end of the day or whenever the transaction is to

11

take place, and you implement that transaction.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't it ­­ why isn't

13

doing it through a computer not enough?

14

cotton gin not an invention because it just means you're

15

doing through a machine what people used to do by hand?

16

It's not an invention.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20
21
22

I mean, was the

It's the same old, same old.
Justice Scalia ­­
Why ­­ why is a computer

any different in that respect?
MR. PHILLIPS:
completely.

At one level I agree with you

There is no difference between them.

This Court has, however, said on more than a

23

few occasions, albeit in dicta, that coming up with an

24

idea and then say, use a computer, is not sufficient.

25

And what I'm trying to suggest to you is we don't fall

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10

2

4

within that dicta.
Now, if you don't accept the dicta and you
say use a computer is fine, then I think we're done.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I'm not saying use a

5

computer is ­­ is much of a novelty.

6

that goes to whether it's novel or not.

7

use a computer, you haven't invented anything.

8

you come up with a serious program that ­­ that does it,

9

then, you know, that may be novel.

10

I mean, that's ­­
If you just say
But if

But that's a novelty

issue, isn't it?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

To be sure, Justice Scalia.
And this is exactly the

13

question I really would like to you to focus on for me.

14

Why is it ­­ and I'm not saying this from a point of

15

view, but it seems to me pretty clear that if what you

16

did was take the idea of solvency ­­ remember King Tut,

17

that’s why I use the exaggeration ­­ and what you say

18

is implemented by having the abacus man keep track and

19

say stop, okay ­­

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Then we implement it by

22

having somebody with a pencil and a piece of paper and

23

this is all that they add, you see.

24

with a pencil and a piece of paper keeping track and

25

saying, stop, or we say, implement it in the computer,

Alderson Reporting Company

Say:

Have a man

Official

11
1

which will automatically keep track and say stop, are

2

they all enough?

3

rule?

4

Are some of them enough?

What's the

And you realize I couldn't figure out much

5

in Prometheus to go beyond what I thought was an obvious

6

case, leaving it up to you and your colleagues to figure

7

out how to go further.

8

clear enough what's bothering me?

9

to get your answer to this.

10

Am I making enough ­­ making

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I'd really like

And ­­ and look, there's

11

no ­­ I'll be the first one to ­­ to confess that trying

12

to use language to describe these things is not all that

13

easy.

14

this is to say that this is not simply something that

15

was a fundamental truth, this is not something that

16

simply says use a computer.

It's not simply something

17

that says maintain solvency.

It ­­ it operates in a

18

much more specific and concrete environment where you're

19

dealing with a problem that's been in existence since

20

the 1970s, a solution in the 1990s, that CLS itself

21

acknowledges needed a solution and came forward with

22

their own solution that looks a lot like ours.

23

But the way I think you can meaningfully look at

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But my ­­ my initial

24

question, and I think I can work this into King Tut,

25

is ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

­­ is ­­ is whether or not

3

you could have patented that system, idea, process,

4

method, without attaching a computer program.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

You cannot, absolutely cannot

6

do that with this system, because it is so complex and

7

so many interrelated parts.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Suppose I thought ­­ and,

again, it's just a thought because I don't have the

10

expertise ­­ that any computer group of people sitting

11

around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley could do this

12

over a weekend.

Suppose I thought that.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

I'm certain that's true.

You mean wrote the code?

Right. Well, that's absolutely ­­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19
20
21
22

Yes.

Well, then ­­ then ­­
But that's true of almost all

software.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then why is the computer

program necessary to make the patent valid?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's ­­ it's necessary

23

to make the invention effective.

24

General said, the computer is essential to the efficacy

25

of this invention because of the complicated financial

As the Solicitor

arrangements that exist and that can only be resolved on

2

a ­­ on a real­time basis.

3

happen to be waiting for the pyramids to be finished or

4

waiting for the gold to move in and out, but it doesn't

5

help with you an abacus if you're dealing with literally

6

thousands of transactions simultaneously going on in

7

different countries at different points in time.

8
9
10

Your abacus is great if you

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's just an idea,

hey, let's use a computer.
MR. PHILLIPS:

But it's not just ­­ I mean,

11

obviously, part of it is use the computer, Justice

12

Kennedy.

13

See, I ­­

14
15

But more fundamentally, it goes beyond that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your software

copyrighted?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I don't believe so.
There is no special

18

software that comes with this ­­ that's part of this

19

patent, is it ­­ is there?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Justice Ginsburg, what

21

we did here is what the Patent and Trademark Office

22

encourages us to do and encourages all software patent

23

writers to do, which is to identify the functions that

24

you want to be provided for with the software and leave

25

it then to the software writers, who I gather are, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

know, quite capable of converting these functions into

2

very specific code.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Phillips, could you ­­

4

could you disaggregate your argument for me?

5

you just said, look, this Court has said it's not

6

sufficient if you have an idea and then you say use a

7

computer to implement it; right?

8

your ­­ that ­­ are you saying that you're doing more

9

than saying use a computer to implement it or are you

Because

So are you saying that

10

saying that it's ­­ that the idea itself is more than an

11

idea?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I'm saying ­­

Which part of what ­­
I'm saying both actually.

I

15

mean, I'm making both of those arguments.

16

believe that if you analyze the claims and you don't

17

caricature them and you don't strip them out of the

18

limitations that are embedded in there, this is not some

19

kind of an abstract concept.

20

it's not an abstract idea.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. PHILIPS:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is something that

3

you've patented that has ­­ that is not just simple use

4

a third party to do a settlement.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Right.
And what is that, putting

It is ­­ well ­­ and again,

it's difficult to do that because you absolutely need

10

the computer in order to implement this.

11

the invention is the notion of being able

12

simultaneously, dealing with it on a chronological basis

13

to stop transactions that will otherwise interfere with

14

the ability to settle on time and under the appropriate

15

circumstances.

16

real­time basis when you're dealing with a global economy

17

is to use a computer.

18

of this.

19

But the key to

And the only way you can do that in a

It is necessary to the efficacy

So in that sense, I can't ­­ I can't

20

disaggregate it the way in some sense you're suggesting.

21

It seems to me it's bound up with in ­­ it's bounds up

22

with the whole notion of is this an abstract concept.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you in fact ­­ now,

24

this is ­­ look, there are 42 briefs in this case.

25

actually read them and I found them very, very helpful

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

16
1

up to the point where I have to make a decision, because

2

they're serious.

3

that I came away with is the one that you're beginning

4

to discuss, that if you simply say, take an idea that's

5

abstract and implement it on a computer, there are ­­

6

you're going to get it much faster, you're going to be

7

able to do many, many things, and if that's good enough,

8

there is a risk that you will take business in the

9

United States or large segments and instead of having

I mean, you know ­­ now, the problem

10

competition on price, service and better production

11

methods, we'll have competition on who has the best

12

patent lawyer.

You see where I'm going on that one?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, of course.
And if you go the other way

15

and say never, then what you do is you rule out real

16

inventions with computers.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And so in those 42 briefs,

19

there are a number of suggestions as to how to go

20

between Scylla and Charybdis.

21

know ­­ I don't know if you can step back from your

22

representational model.

23

we have now.

24

to know what in your opinion is the best way of sailing

25

between these two serious harms.

Now, I would like to

That's a problem. But you’re all

And ­­ and from my point of view, I need

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Breyer, I guess

2

I would suggest to you that you might want to deal with

3

the problem you know as opposed to the problems you

4

don't know at this stage.

5

method patents and software patents in existence for

6

well over a decade and they're obviously quite

7

significant in number.

8

system is we have.

9

right, and didn't say no to business methods patents,

I mean, we have had business

And ­­ and we know what the

And Congress looked at that system,

10

didn't say no to software patents, instead said the

11

solution to this problem is to get it out of the

12

judicial process and create an administrative process,

13

but leave the substantive standards intact.

14

So my suggestion to you would be follow that

15

same advice, a liberal interpretation of 101 and not a

16

caricature of the claims, analyze the claims as written,

17

and therefore say that the solution is 102 and 103 and

18

use the administrative process.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you ­­
Mr. Phillips, let me just

20

stop you there, because four Justices of this Court did

21

not read that legislative history the way you do.

22

it was ­­ was in Bilski.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

And

But this is post­Bilski.
Justice Stevens went

carefully through that and he said:

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress was

Official

18
1

reacting to a decision.

2

101.

3

didn't buy that argument.

4

It had ­­ it was not addressing

So there are at least four Justices who say ­­ who

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, it still seems

5

to me that the ­­ the natural inference is Congress did

6

not change 101.

7

So on the one hand, you've got a problem that

2

much more categorically either that there's no such

3

thing as business method patents or adopt the Solicitor

General's interpretation, which is to say that there

5

cannot be software unless the software somehow actually

6

improves the computer, as opposed to software improving

7

every other device or any other mechanism that might be

8

out there.

9

On the other hand, if this Court were to say

What we know is that this would inherently

10

declare and in one fell swoop hundreds of thousands of

11

patents invalid, and the consequences of that it seems

12

to me are utterly unknowable.

13

down that path, I would think it would think long and

14

hard about whether isn't that a judgment that Congress

ought to make.

essentially where the Court was in Chakrabarty, where

everybody was saying you've got to act in one way or the

That path between Scylla and Charybdis was

is just ­­ you know, you have an opinion for a court.

9

Different judges can have different interpretations.

10

All you're getting is mine, okay?

11

But I think it's pretty easy to say that

12

Archimedes can't just go to a boat builder and say,

13

apply my idea.

14

But now we try to take that word "apply" and give

15

content to it.

16

All right.

Everybody agrees with that.

And what I suspect, in my opinion, Mayo did

17

and Bilski and the other cases is sketch an outer shell

18

of the content, hoping that the experts, you and the

19

other lawyers and the ­­ the circuit court, could fill

20

in a little better than we had done the content of that

21

shell.

22

So, so far you're saying, well, this is

23

close enough to Archimedes saying "apply it" that we

24

needn't go further.

Now, will you at some point in the next few

Alderson Reporting Company

2

to go further, what would the right words or example be?

3

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, as ­­ Justice

4

Breyer, as to abstract ideas, the PTO has filled in that

5

shell by listing economic concepts, legal concepts,

6

financial concepts, teaching concepts, dating and

7

interpersonal relationships and generally how business

8

should be conducted as examples of those things that are

9

likely abstract, which, of course, all follow directly

10

from Bilski and the discussion this Court had in Bilski.

12

that.

MR. PERRY:

You can take those things,

Justice Breyer, I think your point is

the reason that it is equally fallacious to suggest, on

23

the one hand, as Alice and IBM does, that simply

reciting a computer is a magic key that gets you through

of those things have to be wrong because what the Court

qualifies.

certainly the Court held that the term "process" got a

natural construction which could include business

methods, it seems to me that that's not all the Court

methods were patent eligible.

application.

And, of course, the holding in Bilski was

21

that the ­­ the method for hedging risk was ineligible

because it was an abstract idea, and I can't imagine

that if in Bilski the ­­ the claim had been exactly the

same but had added use a computer to carry out some of

25

these standard random analysis functions that are

2

be patent eligible.

3

And I ­­ I would submit for the Court that

4

the key point here, I think, is that now, given where

5

the Court ­­ what the Court has held in Bilski, given

6

what it's held in Mayo, the abstract ideas exception is

7

really the only tool left to deal with what I ­­ what I

9

problem, the proliferation of patents of business

10
11

methods.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there an example that

12

you can give us of a ­­ what we can call a business

13

process that is patentable, a process that doesn't

14

involve improving the workings of a computer?

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I ­­ I think it's going

16

to be difficult for me to do that.

17

example, if you had a business method, a process for

18

additional security point­of­sale credit card

19

transactions using particular encryption technology,

20

that might well be patent eligible.

21

that it makes conduct of business more efficient or

22

effective.

I think, for

It's a technology

23

But there is a technological link here, and

24

we do think that's critical to our ­­ to our point of

25

view with respect to the case.

And I ­­ and I do think,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51

remember, that when we say something is not patent

2

eligible, we're not saying they can't do it.

3

saying they can't monopolize it.

4

We're

And the concern in a situation like this one

5

is that if this is patent eligible, it's hard to see

6

why, for example, the first person who came up with a

7

frequent flier program wouldn't have been able to claim

8

a patent there, because, after all, that's a business

9

method for improving customer loyalty implemented on a

10
11

computer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

consider, and there are six different ones.

doubtful that that's going to bring about greater

clarity and certainty.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I'm just wondering, in your

I take ­­ I take the

19

point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the key is that

20

they are all directed to answering the question of

21

whether the innovation that is claimed and is an

22

innovation in either, A, the improvement of a computer's

23

functioning or, B, the use of computer technology to

24

improve the functioning of another technological

25

process, and a case like Diehr would be in the latter

Alderson Reporting Company

category.
And so I do think that that's the key

3

benchmark.

4

we do think can be applied clearly and consistently by

5

the courts or the PTO.

like frequent flier programs or the Oakland A's money

That's the ­­ drawing that line keeps them

12

out; not drawing that line lets them in.

13

due respect, I don't think that the novelty and

14

nonobviousness filters at 102 and 103 really deal with

15

that problem effectively, because when you get to

16

nonobviousness in 103, for example, you'll be asking a

17

different question.

would say, well, is this innovation in building consumer

20

loyalty something that would have been obvious to

somebody who runs an airline?

from the question of technology at that point and,

therefore, I don't think you're going to get the screen

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

I'd just like to make a few points.

22

First of all, with respect to the question

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

you asked, which is looking at 159, et cetera, all I can

24

tell you is that if you look at claim 33, it talks about

5

And it's all designed

It's only one element of the ­­ of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your adversary says that

his ­­ the appendix to his brief are the only patents at

10

issue, that the flow charts are not at issue in this

11

case.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

There's no basis for that

13

statement, Your Honor.

14

on a very truncated litigation process.

15

you know, we ­­ we got cut off at the beginning of it.

16

There's been no construction of the ­­ of the claims

17

18

to how you interpret the claim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, he wants to say no

MR. PHILLIPS:

No business methods ­­ just another

And it seems to me extraordinary

10

11

the judicial exception to accomplish precisely that same

12

thing.

13

It seems to me that's wholly inappropriate.

Justice Ginsburg, you asked my ­­ my friend

14

here, you know, what's his test?

15

question, you'll notice, because he doesn't have an

16

answer.

17

kill this patent.

18

He didn't answer that

His basic argument is, whatever you do, just

And if I were in his shoes, I suppose I'd

19

take that same position.

20

clear is that the test ought to be one that is

21

structured as a very coarse filter, not the kind of

22

filter that he's pushing for where it changes over time.

23

I mean, I thought his ­­ I thought his response to one

24

of the questions about e­mail and word processing that

25

Justice Sotomayor asked is over time it would change.
