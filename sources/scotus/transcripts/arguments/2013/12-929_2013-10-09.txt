Mr. Hastings.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAMS S. HASTINGS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HASTINGS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Forum selection clauses have been frequently

13

used in contracts of all types.

14

as written, and the enforcement of a contractual forum

15

selection clause should not just be left to convenience

16

discretionary balancing tests.

They should be enforced

17

Rule 12(b)(3), in Section 1406 of the United

18

States Code, provide appropriate and effective means for

19

enforcing a contractual forum selection clause.

20

language of those provisions is written broadly.

21

Congress used words like "wrong," and the rule uses the

22

word "improper," which have plain and natural meanings

23

that are broad and are sufficient to authorize district

24

courts to act to enforce the contractual clause.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

Is ­­ is it common in the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection

2

clause is a venue provision?

3

something that Congress determined.

4

MR. HASTINGS:

I thought venue was

Your Honor, the cases do

5

discuss it as a venue provision.

6

this Court's decision in Stewart addressed a forum

7

selection clause in a 1404(a) transfer analysis, which

8

is clearly a venue analysis.

9

the 2011 amendments to the United States Code, Congress

One example would be

In addition to that, with

10

adopted a definition of venue.

11

That definition says the place of litigation.

12

paraphrasing it, but it's ­­ it's a pretty

13

straightforward definition.

14

It's in Section 1390.
I'm

The legislative history of Section 201 of

15

that Act acknowledges that the definition was intended

16

to make venue determinations easier and to make it

17

clearer that parties could waive or adjust these types

18

of provisions even by contract.

19

contract."

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

The words "by

In the Stewart case to which

21

you just referred, the court said, "The parties do not

22

dispute that the district court properly denied the

23

motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under

24

1406(a)" because Respondent apparently does business in

25

the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the

Alderson Reporting Company

4

jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause.
So what ­­ if we were to write an opinion in
your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?
MR. HASTINGS:

Your Honor, I believe the

5

correct reading of that language is what the Second

6

Circuit has said in the trade comment decision, and

7

others have written on this, that Stewart and ­­ and the

8

text read by that footnote.

9

believe.

10
11

That's footnote 8, I

The text right there said, "The immediate

issue is how we address 1404(a)."
And the way the majority of the circuit

12

courts have read it is the issue in Stewart, this

13

procedural issue that we're here on today, which is

14

simply not presented to the Court.

15

And so the Court could very easily write a

16

decision that acknowledges Stewart still controls on a

17

1404(a) analysis, but acknowledged that, like the majority

18

of the circuits, that Stewart simply did not have to

19

address this problem.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's ­­ that's true,

21

but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is

22

beside the point.

23

issue that really never should arise because the party

24

seeking ­­ as you see it, the party seeking to enforce

25

the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406.

The Court wrote a decision about an

5
Alderson Reporting Company

So Stewart said, well, if ­­ if you proceed

2

under the wrong provision, this is how it should come

3

out.

meaningless, doesn't it?

MR. HASTINGS:

It makes the whole decision essentially

Justice Alito, I respectfully

6

disagree.

8

facts of Stewart, the same situation would arise, of

9

And here's what the meaning of Stewart would
First of all, under the

10

That may be a narrow line of cases, but that would still

11

apply in a case where a party doesn't assert the

12

contract at first.

13

But there's another place where Stewart

14

would still apply, when a case is filed in the proper

15

jurisdiction.

16

Virginia, there would be a very limited place for

17

exceptional circumstances for a court to look at a

18

1404(a) analysis and determine if public interest

19

required something other than the contract clause.

20

Here, if this lawsuit had been filed in

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't see how that

21

would ­­ I don't see how that would work.

22

this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that

23

if this ­­ if the case had been filed in the

24

jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause,

25

that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and

That's ­­ that's your argument, right?

MR. HASTINGS:

Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

In exceptional cases.

But

6

1404(a) says that it can ­­ a case can be transferred to

7

a district where it might have been brought.

8

argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in

9

the Western District of Texas, that's a place where

10
11

And your

there's a wrong venue.
MR. HASTINGS:

And, Your Honor, the language

12

of the statutes, particularly, the language you were

13

just referring to about "might have been brought," needs

14

to be read in context of decisions from this Court.

15

Van Dusen, this Court held that that language "might

16

have been brought" was a term of art.

17

The Court has never reached that conclusion

In

18

with respect to wrong or improper.

19

the Court said the "might have been brought" language

20

was a term of art referring back to a congressionally

21

chosen venue under 1391.

22

And in Van Dusen,

And so, when this plays out under 1404(a),

23

the court ­­ if the case is in the proper venue and

24

we're on to the second issue of 1404(a), the proper

25

reading of the language would allow the court, truly

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in exceptional circumstances, to follow ­­ follow the

2

language of the statute and send it to another place

3

where Congress said the case could have been.

4

And, again, this is really the second issue

5

in the case.

6

exceptional cases where parties had contracted for a

7

forum, they've truly resolved the conveniences among the

8

parties among themselves.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We would emphasize that it's truly

Mr. Hastings, Section 1391

10

says the following, "Except as otherwise provided by

11

law" ­­ not by contract ­­ "by law, this section shall

12

govern" ­­ shall govern ­­ "the venue of all" ­­ "all

13

civil actions brought in district courts of the United

14

States."

15

for where venue in a case can lie.

So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking,

17

well, those rules apply.

19

agreement, except to the extent that the contract can

22

the statute says what the statute says.

23

MR. HASTINGS:

And they can't be reversed or

But it's not

Here is venue.

And, Your Honor, the language

24

of Section 1391, and the first part, I believe it's

25

1391(a) where it has the language of "shall govern in

8
Alderson Reporting Company

2

this Court said in Stewart of Federal law controls venue

3

in Federal courts.

4

But the issue that comes up is that venue ­­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's only ­­ what that

13

tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing.

14

You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have

15

to.

16

My problem with your interpretation is you

17

are allowing a private agreement to make a venue

8

MR. HASTINGS:

And, Your Honor, in response

to that, first of all, the venue rights have always

10

been, like many Federal rights, waiverable provisions.

11

And when a contract ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That doesn't mean it's

It means it's waiverable.

MR. HASTINGS:

And, Your Honor, the language

15

of the word "improper," improper is a broad term, and it

has a broad meaning.

for just a second.

18

"improper" and "wrong."

Although the FAA gives parties the right to

12(b) motions, allowing parties not to have to answer

9

complicated Federal cases and get to proceed to

10
11

arbitration more quickly.
Giving the language a plain and natural

12

meaning allows the courts to, essentially, do justice

13

and allow to streamline and have efficient running of

14

cases and to enforce parties' rights in contracts.

do you think that parties can actually create personal

jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law?

6

Just like anybody can waive almost everything

MR. HASTINGS:

But

Focusing on personal

7

jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction, yes,

8

because parties can consent and contract to waive the

9

personal jurisdiction objections.

11

courts.

This Court has emphasized that

10

it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system,

11

the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all

12

over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just

13

transfer to the appropriate forum.

14

Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as

15

you say, is ­­ it's only dismissal, no transfer.

16

And that's what

MR. HASTINGS: And Justice Ginsburg,that is one

17

of the ­­ one of the concerns with the rule.

18

Professor Sachs' approach does, first of all, start off

19

with a strong benefit of enforcing contracts.

20

not as effective as 12(b)(3), because when we are

20

bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we

21

deal with the problem of removal?

22

remove a case to a court which is in the district where

23

to the court within the district because of the forum

selection clause, and he can't go into another court

because of 1441(a).

to either take the 1404 approach, or we ought to take

7

Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to

8

that.

Congress said ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress said that these rules, with the

would work out is if ­­ focusing on the 1404(a) issue,

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a terrible thing.

You

13

have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say

14

1404(a) and it ­­ I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous

15

practical difference.

16

But if it makes not much difference, I have

17

three routes that seem to me all should work out the

18

same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute

19

language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the

footnote.

So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make ­­

shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same

25

conclusions.

2

that?

3

What about ­­ now, what's the answer to

MR. HASTINGS:

Justice Breyer, first of all,

4

I would agree with you that under this case, all three

5

routes should have lead ­­ led to the exact same

6

conclusion.

7

but that may not be in all cases.

8

that parties should be forced to honor their contracts.

That's ­­ that is correct under this case,
Why it matters is

9

And so if a party honors its contract and

10

there's a very high standard, such as the exceptional

11

circumstances standard for receiving a transfer,

12

their ­­ parties who are following their contract, it's

13

unlikely you're going to have much litigation over

14

transfers.

15

Whereas if a party can say I can try my shot

16

at a home court forum, file in violation of the contract

17

and then make the other party raise this issue and have

18

to litigate venue, we're going to have a tremendous

19

litigation about venue.

20

That's the problem.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The law travels with ­­

21

the law of the transferring State travels to the

22

transferred State.

23

Texas law, if you go under 1404, to Virginia.

24
25

So they've undone ­­ they're taking

MR. HASTINGS:

And that would be a problem

in many cases, Your Honor.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that would defeat

2

the purpose of the venue selection to start with.

3

That's part of your argument?

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would be taken care

5

of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply

6

when a party is acting in violation of a contractual

7

provision.

8

give the plaintiff plaintiff's choice of initial forum.

9

If plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the

10
11

Van Dusen against Barrack was intended to

contract, there's no reason why Van Dusen should apply.
MR. HASTINGS:

And, Justice Ginsburg,

12

that ­­ that points out that if the Court were to not

13

just strictly enforce the contracts, it raises many new

14

issues that this Court has not yet had to address.

I’d like to reserve my time.

judgment based on facts that were developed 1,500 miles

JUSTICE ALITO:

If 1404 is the correct

procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something

16

like this, where there is a forum selection clause, the

17

burden is on ­­ the burden of trying to establish venue

18

in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the

19

forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking

20

the forum selection clause.

21

And the only factors that can be considered

22

against the forum selection clause to ­­ to result in an

23

exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are

24

factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of

clause.

So in your case, if there had been a

hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern

Mr. Hastings, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. HASTINGS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HASTINGS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have just a few brief comments.

6

First, the parties bargained for the right

7

result, and they bargained and reached a contract that

8

should settle the issue of convenience and where this

9

case should be litigated.

Stewart has an important

10

observation that I think needs to be emphasized.

11

under a 1404(a) analysis, the majority in Stewart said

12

The Bremen is still instructive.

13

instructive on anything, on any rules enforcing a

14

contract, it should be instructive at this level.

15

The burden should be on the party trying to

Even

And if it's

16

get out from their contract.

17

misallocated the burden.

18

high one.

19

circumstances or perhaps even more, and it should not be

20

a case where a party can avoid its contract based upon

21

inconveniences that were foreseeable at the time of

22

contracting.

23

The Fifth Circuit

The burden should also be a

It really should require exceptional

For example, the fact that J­Crew hired

24

Texans to work on its project, it knew what the project

25

was about and what it would need to do, and it should

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not be able to rely upon hiring Texans to change the

2

deal it negotiated with my client.

3

There needs to be a clear rule that allows

4

the courts to hopefully answer the questions about

5

contracts and venue, so we all can stop litigating these

6

issues and know the right answers and avoid inundating

7

the courts with motions to transfer for parties wanting

8

to renegotiate contracts.

9

Since the Third Circuit and Sixth Circuit

10

and, now, the Fifth Circuit have adopted the minority

11

position, there has been a proliferation of litigation

12

when a contract already answered the question.

13

many cases in our cert petition in a footnote, and I

14

know there's been many more since then.

15

the ones that you can find published.

That doesn't even

16

mention the ones that are unpublished.

And so a clear

17

rule needs to be in place to avoid these problems.

18

Justice Kagan, you raised the issue of forum

We cited

And those are

19

non conveniens as perhaps the answer as to what would

20

happen for a State or foreign contract clause.

21

to briefly touch on that because I don't believe that's

22

the right answer.

I wanted

23

The Bremen looked at a case that came up as

24

a forum non conveniens case and said, we are not going

25

to use the forum non conveniens test for enforcing a

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contract requiring litigation in an international forum.

2

They resoundingly rejected the forum non conveniens

3

approach, and I believe the circuit courts have read

4

Bremen as rejecting that approach.

5

If that were going to be the approach to

6

answer the problem created by the Fifth Circuit for

7

foreign and State courts, what we would end up with is a

8

new common law approach, whether called forum non

9

conveniens or called something else, that looks like

10

nothing like forum non conveniens and probably a whole

11

new line of litigation over how that's ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think you mistook my point

13

at least.

14

comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court

15

says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so.

Maybe I didn't express it clearly.

Bremen

16

So ­­ you know, the fact that it comes up on

17

a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the

18

question of whether the contract controls where, people have

19

negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no

20

exceptional public interest otherwise.

21

MR. HASTINGS:

And, Justice Kagan, following

22

Bremen, the lower courts have recognized that what

23

essentially Bremen is doing is saying forum non

24

conveniens is not the right approach, and so instead of

25

a common law vehicle to answer this issue, we submit

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the right answer is right there in the rules

2

already.

3

It's 12(b)(3) is the best answer.

Section

4

1406 allows the Court also to address this issue.

5

Honestly, Section ­­ Rule 12(b)(6) in Professor Sachs'

6

approach is much better than leaving these issues to

7

balancing tests.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

question about 12(b)(6)?

10

MR. HASTINGS:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask you one last

Yes, Your Honor.
Which is ­­ you know, when

12

1404 is ­­ suppose a State which does not recognize

13

these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart.

14

But if you were under 12(b)(6), you would have to go to

15

what Justice Scalia does in the Stewart dissent.

16

think you would have to go to a twin aims of Erie

17

analysis.

18

I

And in that circumstance, it seems to me

19

that the State law would come out the victor; isn't that

20

right?

21

MR. HASTINGS:

Justice Kagan, the only way I

22

know how to answer that question is I do not know how

23

the Professor Sachs approach can actually be reconciled

24

with Stewart.

25

plays out as an issue that I do not know how it plays

There is significant tensions in how that

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out, but I suspect it would result in lots of

2

litigation ­­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it's under 12(b)(3),

4

then Stewart stays, and it's Federal law that controls

5

and the judge decides, right?

6

MR. HASTINGS:

Yes, Your Honor, and that's

7

why we are asking this Court to follow the majority

8

approach on this issue.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
