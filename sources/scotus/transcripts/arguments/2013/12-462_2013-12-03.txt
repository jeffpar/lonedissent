CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

5

Incorporated v. Rabbi Ginsberg.

6

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under this Court's decision in Wolens, there

12

are only two relevant questions here, and the Ninth

13

Circuit got both of them wrong.

14

whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent

15

flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices,

16

routes, and services.

17

The first question is

This Court answered that question in the

18

affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored that the

19

question's not particularly close.

20

ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise

21

same context underscores how far they have strayed from

22

this Court's precedence.

23

The Ninth Circuit's

The second question is whether the

24

Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the

25

parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and

2

enlarge the parties' bargain.

3

And it's to that question 2 we think

4

Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear.

5

Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the

6

parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract

7

claim, and lost on the merits.

8
9

The implied preemption claim is different.
It seeks to impose a duty of fair dealing and

10

reasonableness and superimposed that on the bargain,

11

even where the parties to the contract have essentially

12

given one party absolute discretion.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, the argument

14

was made that if ­­ if the airline has an unreviewable

15

right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for

16

no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory

17

contract.

18

What ­­ what is your answer to that, if one

19

party can get out willy­nilly, why ­­ what kind of

20

bargain is it?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there are a couple of

22

answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.

23

although the focus on whether a contract is illusory is

24

sometimes used as part of the analysis under the implied

25

covenant for a bilateral contract, I don't think that

4
Alderson Reporting Company

The first is I think

Official

1

same analysis would apply to something like a frequent

2

flyer program, which I think would be properly

3

understood as a unilateral contract, where you don't

4

worry about those sort of illusory promises.

5
6

The second thing is I think you have to
understand in the context ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

Did a unitary contract?
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I

understand that point.
MR. CLEMENT:

There ­­ there is a

12

distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on

13

contract law between a unilateral contract and a

14

bilateral contract.

15

A unilateral contract is ­­ is a typical

16

sort of outstanding promise, that promise doesn't

17

require an exchange of consideration, and the party who

18

makes the promise has the ability to withdraw the

19

promise until there's ­­ there's performance,

20

essentially, relying on the promise.

21

And that's why I think it's actually a

22

little bit of a mistake to apply that doctrine to

23

something like a frequent flyer program.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't understand

that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these agreements worked were there were agreements that,

2

if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was

3

going to get a free ticket.

4

And ­­ and it wasn't a gift that I was

5

getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I

6

flew a certain number of miles, so that there was an

7

exchange with value on both sides.

8

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I ­­ I suppose you could

9

conceive of it that way.

You could also conceive of it

10

as, basically, being a premium that's offered by the

11

company to reward your loyalty, but you've already

12

gotten full performance.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I think you have to

14

conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a

15

unilateral contract.

16

another promise.

17

performance of an act; that is, flying the

18

airline ­­ you know, a certain number of miles.

19

It's not a promise in exchange for

It's a promise in exchange for the

You're correct, it is a ­­ a unilateral

20

contract.

21

no ­­ is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral

22

contract?

23

Now, whether that ­­ that means that there's

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think there really

24

is ­­ you know, I looked at the ­­ the treatises for

25

that, and I just don't think that concept really applies

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in the unitary ­­ the unilateral contract context.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't ­­ I just don't see

3

why that would make sense because, if I knew that it was

4

really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was

5

willing to get it and maybe I wasn't.

6

that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your

7

planes ­­ you know, I'd find another company that

8

actually gave me the free ticket.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think

And that, really, I think,

10

gets to the nub of this because, of course, what you're

11

suggesting is that there would be a market solution to

12

this problem.

13

Act is all about, letting the market decide these

14

issues.

15

And that's what the Airline Deregulation

So, if some airline really were crazy enough

16

to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal

17

customers, surely, the market would solve that.

18

course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of

19

Transportation stands ready to police that.

20

But ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, of

But, usually, what we say

22

when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh,

23

we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market

24

will solve it.

25

consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that

We say the contract has no

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg pointed out.

2

And the question is:

If there's really no

3

obligation on the part of the airline here to give that

4

free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it

5

and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there

6

any consideration?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Why isn't the contract illusory?
There ­­ there is

8

consideration ­­ I'm not sure anything turns on this ­­

9

but there is consideration because this is not something

10

where the airline says, look, we can do anything we

11

want.

12

They say, look, if you present us with miles

13

while you're still in good standing in the program,

14

we'll give you upgrades, we'll let you into a lounge.

15

But if, pursuant to the contract, you abuse the program,

16

in our sole discretion, then you lose your membership

17

status.

18

And that's what's happened here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you ­­ you're not

19

trying to enforce the contract anyway.

20

to get out of the contract.

21

happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right?

22

What do you care?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

You ­­ you want

So you ­­ you ought to be

Well, that is true, but I

24

suppose the argument might be that you could, as a

25

matter of breach of contract law, use this principle to

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

interpret the contract.

2

it's an argument that's made under Count 1 of this

3

complaint.

4

And, if that were an argument,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, you're

5

making ­­ you're making an assumption.

6

is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program.

7

His allegation is that the only reason you terminated

8

with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of

9

these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the

11

The claim here

other airline.
That's the same as saying, they didn't

12

terminate me because I abused the program, they

13

terminated me because I was of a certain race, or I was

14

a woman, or I was handicapped, or some other improper

15

consideration.

16

So are you suggesting that this contract

17

permits you to use that kind of self ­­ that kind of

18

ground, one not grounded in the contract, but grounded

19

in your whim and caprice?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

Justice Sotomayor.

22

really important to emphasize that the claim about

23

pretext and this all being about the merger is actually

24

not something that's made in the breach of contract

25

count or the breach of implied covenant count.

Well, a couple of points,
First of all, I think it's ­­ it's

9
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

1

pled, actually, in the misrepresentation counts,

2

Counts 3 and 4 of the complaint, that everybody

3

recognizes are preemptive.

4

Now, what's pled in contract Count 1, the

5

breach of contract count, is that, under the contract,

6

somehow, we don't have the ability to terminate somebody

7

without just cause.

8

9

And that's the argument that the

Now, the implied covenant count, Count 2, is

10

different.

11

duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that duty is

12

superimposed on the contract, even if the contract gives

13

one of the parties absolute discretion.

14

It says that, under State law, there is a

And those aren't my words.

Those are the

15

words of Count 2 of the complaint at Joint Appendix page

16

51.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even if you have

18

absolute discretion, isn't there a limit to that?

19

there a limit of reasonableness to that absolute

20

discretion?

21

you have a contract with no substance.

22

Isn't

That's the whole question of ­­ otherwise,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, the way I would think

23

about it, Justice Sotomayor, is "absolute" might not

24

quite mean absolute, and the place to make that argument

25

is under the breach of contract rubric; that, you can

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cite Cardozo and Lady Duff­Gordon.

2

But when you get to saying, even if the

3

contract's absolute, State law still superimposes a

4

reasonableness requirement on the contract, that's the

5

point at which preemption kicks in.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that entirely ­­ I mean,

7

suppose the contract said, "in its absolute discretion

8

and subject to no obligation of good faith."

said that.

I ­­ as I

11

by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to

13

contracts have this implied covenant of good faith.

14

But that can't really be right because

There's an implied duty to perform in good

15

faith.

16

in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my

17

membership for certain kinds of reasons, and that's all

18

the complaint said.

And that means that this discretion is narrowed

There was just this one count.

19

Do you think that would be preempted?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the reliance on the

21

implied covenant in that context should be preempted.

22

think that's the better rule.

23

If this Court wanted to adopt a narrower

24

rule and say, look, it's really at the point that you

25

try to bring a separate implied covenant claim, that's

14
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

preempted, I suppose, as a matter of adminstrability,

2

you could do that.

3

I mean, you do have to take a practical look at this.

4

It might make some sense, because ­­

In the wake of Wolens, if you plead a

5

routine breach of contract claim, you're going to avoid

6

preemption.

7

risk of preemption by pleading a separate claim is when

8

you're trying to really get outside of the terms of the

9

contract.

10

The only reason, practically, you run the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess what I'm suggesting

11

is that the implied covenant here, it's just an

12

interpretive tool.

13

of provisions that are written very broadly or very

14

vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us

15

interpret those kinds of provisions.

16

It says that there are certain kinds

And, viewed in that way, it's just a

17

contractual device that, in light of Wolens, ought to be

18

permitted.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, here's my thought on

20

that, which is I think even the Respondents admit that,

21

in some States, the implied covenant is much more than

22

simply a rule of construction for the explicit terms of

23

the contract.

24
25

And I suppose, if this Court wants to say
that the only way the implied covenant is not preempted,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is when it's just a rule of construction for the

2

explicit terms of the contract, I suppose we could live

3

with that rule, and I think we'd certainly win in this

4

case.

5

The reason I would suggest that the better

6

rule for this Court to adopt is that the implied

7

covenant should just be preempted, even in that

8

circumstance, is because, in that circumstance, it

9

doesn't add anything.

10

If it really is just a rule of construction

11

for the express terms of the contract, you could get in

12

the same place with the citation to Cardozo and Lady

13

Duff­Gordon.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought they were

2

saying that, in some States, it's not an implied term of

3

the contract, but a different sort of provision.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I may have misspoke.

5

What I meant is I think both parties agree, as they

6

would have to, that, in some States, the Implied

7

Covenant Doctrine is used to directly impose public

8

policy.

9

In Montana, that seems to be the case.

10

And so, in Alaska, that seems to be the case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about Minnesota?

In

11

Minnesota, isn't it just a rule of construction of the

12

contract?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

We don't believe so, Your

14

Honor.

15

Minnesota law is pellucidly clear on this.

16

Minnesota ­­ the Minnesota Supreme Court case ­­ the

17

Hennepin case that adopts ­­ recognizes the implied

18

covenant, cites the Restatement.

19

I think ­­ I'm not going to try to tell you that
But

The Restatement quite clearly embraces a

20

view of the implied covenant that goes beyond merely

21

constructing the express terms of the contract.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

And I say,

Official

1

well, what law do you apply?

2

State law, and there's no Federal common law.

3

understand how you can bring an action with no

4

substantive law to inform it.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, you ­­ you have no
I don't

I may have misspoke, Justice

6

Kennedy.

7

the routine breach of contract claim you bring is a

8

State law claim, so we don't have any quarrel with Count

9

1 of this claim, which views Minnesota State contract

10
11

The breach of contract claim that you bring ­­

law to interpret the express terms of the contract.
Where we have a beef is with Count 2 of the

12

complaint that says, even if the contract gives the

13

parties absolute discretion, we are going to superimpose

14

a duty of good faith and fair dealing.

15

And, to complete the answer, since Minnesota

16

has adopted the Restatement, the Restatement suggests

17

that the way you find good faith is you exclude the

18

possibility of bad faith, based on community standards

19

of fairness and decency.

20

And, at the point that you're applying

21

community standards of fairness and decency, it seems to

22

me, quite clear, that you are not applying the parties'

23

self­imposed undertakings, but something else.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I suppose you could

say that it is assumed that parties to a contract

18

comport with community standards of fairness and

2

decency ­­ you know, you can wiggle to there, if you

3

want.

And my point would be the way to try to wiggle there is

And I think if you take a step back and
think about this context:

When an airline reserves to

10

itself the sole discretion to make a judgment about

11

frequent flyers or about taking an unruly passenger off

12

a plane, do you really want State courts applying

13

community standards of decency to judge that, or is that

something that should be judged by a complaint to the

Thank you, counsel.

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. YELIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In Wolens, this Court recognized that
Congress enacted the ADA to leave decisions concerning

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

airline prices, routes, and services to the business

2

judgment of air carriers, subject to market forces and

3

limited oversight by the Department of Transportation.

4

In light of that statutory purpose, Wolens

5

held that claims based on the State common law of

6

contract are not preempted by the ADA to the extent they

7

seek to enforce the voluntary undertakings of the

8

parties.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you had a

10

decision by the Minnesota supreme court on common law

11

contract principles and it said ­­ you know, when the

12

parties use the word "sole" in a contract, we interpret

13

that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint.

parties here use the word "sole."

The

Would the application of that principle
violate ­­ would that be preempted or not?

In that context, I think not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say

going forward.

11

this decision is out there, and they say, "sole."

means they're using the term, subject to the gloss

that's been put on it by the Minnesota supreme court.

So what about in that case?

Going forward, the parties know that

19

scenario, that the airline understood that the gloss was

20

going to be given, although I ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We would assume,

22

then, that the parties knew, whenever they used the word

court.

1

MR. YELIN:

I think that may well be right,

2

Your Honor, but I ­­ I want to caution that an argument

3

like that can prove too much.

4

could suggest, as Respondent argued in the lower court,

5

that, any time a party enters into a contract, the party

endorses or at least accepts all normative principles of

7

contract law.

An argument like that

That would include things like doctrines of
unconscionability and other doctrines that impose
extracontractual limitations on the parties' choices.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're not going

to give me "reasonable" for anything?
MR. YELIN:

No, no.

I absolutely am going

to give you "reasonable."

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. YELIN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

I think it just ­­
Well, if you're

18

going to give me "reasonable" ­­ in other words, the

19

parties' express terms do not say "reasonable"; in fact,

20

the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable,

21

but they take the contractual ­­ the interpretation that

22

the Minnesota supreme court has adopted, I don't know

23

why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota

24

supreme court says there is an implied condition of

25

reasonableness across ­­ across the board and that the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

parties contract against that background, just like they

2

do when there's a specific interpretation of the word

3

"sole."

4

MR. YELIN:

I think the problem, Chief

5

Justice, is that the notion of the doctrine of the

6

implied covenant is extraordinarily broad and

7

encompasses a number of different concepts.

8

encompasses notions of reasonableness and implying

9

limitations to discretionary grants of authority

10
11

It

reserved in contracts.
It also encompasses, in some States,

12

concepts, such as notions of fairness, or which extend

13

beyond the intent of the parties.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me change the

15

hypothetical slightly.

16

one of the parties reserves sole discretion to do

17

something, and then the contract goes on to say, and

18

then, in exercising this discretion, we don't promise to

19

act in a reasonable manner.

20

Suppose the contract says that

But the State court says that, nevertheless,

21

that has to be interpreted to mean that the ­­ the party

22

can only perform in a reasonable manner.

23

would the situation be?

24
25

MR. YELIN:

Then what

I think the ADA would preempt

23

of an argument.

2

to the judgment of air carriers, subject to market

3

forces, decisions concerning rates, routes, or services.

4

The ­­ the crux of the ADA is to leave

And I'd like to underscore this point by

5

pointing out that the interpretation that this Court

6

gives to the ADA is not only going to control frequent

7

flyer programs; it's also going to control things like

8

contracts of carriage, which are ­­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

All right.

10

But, now, the question I have, which is, I think, for

11

anyone who wants to answer it, particularly the

12

government, I absolutely agree with you that ­­ that a

13

free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation

14

Act.

15
16
17
18
19

Given.
I also think frequent flyer programs are

simply price discounts.

Given.

I also think that, if you don't have
contracts, you can't have free markets.

Given.

But I also think that the State cannot, under the

20

guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines.

21

If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we

22

ever had.

23

It'll be 50 different systems, all right?

So, if I think those four things, what

24

standard do I use to separate when a State is and when

25

it is not using its contract law to regulate prices?

MR. YELIN:

Justice Breyer, I heartily

endorse each of the four criteria you identified.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, good.

Then you'll

4

give me the answer because what I'm missing is what the

5

standard is.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. YELIN:

And I think the standard that

8

this Court could adopt and make very clear is that any

9

contract doctrine which seeks to interpret the intent of

10

the parties at the time of the contract's formation is a

11

valid standard to be applied in any suit and is not

12

preempted by the ADA.

13

But any contract doctrine like

seeks to impose extracontractual terms, like community

The ­­ the second part of the same response

is, I don't think the standard that we're articulating

12

is a particularly different one.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are variances, but

14

not variances in such an ineffable question as to

15

whether this is really an effort to discern the real

16

intent of the parties or, rather, whether it's an intent

17

to impose community standards, especially since, as I

18

say, parties intend to adopt community standards,

19

usually.

MR. YELIN:

With respect, Justice Scalia, I

think that's not at all a difficult question.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Northwest claims that the World Perks

9

contract allowed it to terminate Rabbi Ginsberg's

10

membership and take away the miles he had already

11

accrued in reliance on the frequent flyer program

12

contract; that is, that it allowed it, for any reason or

13

on any whim, to deprive him of all of the benefits of

14

the frequent flyer program contract bargain.

15

Our position, in contrast, is that

terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be

25

from a State or if the suit was brought under the

The State says, regardless of what the

5

without any obligation of good faith, even if it says

that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good

9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Again, I think you need to

10

separate out the principle that it can't be waived from

11

the underlying principle of what the covenant is doing,

12

which is giving effect to the bargain that the parties

13

entered into, based on looking at the reasonable

14

expression ­­ the reasonable expectations of the

15

parties.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Wolens ­­

and this is

17

a case that you rely on and that allowed room for

18

contract claims ­­ the expression was "self­imposed

19

undertaking."

20

we didn't take on this obligation, but the law reads it

21

into every contract, whether we want it or not.

22

How is it self­imposed if the party has no

23
24
25

And the airline says, we didn't impose,

say, that it's going to apply anyway?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, the terms of the

contract are the self­imposed undertaking, and then this

is a tool that's being used to understand and

2

interpret the tools of the ­­ terms of the contract and

3

then to enforce them.

4

And this is a widely used tool to interpret

5

terms of contracts, particularly when there are

6

discretionary terms within a contract.

7

that's done in the vast majority of the States, and, in

8

fact, the discretionary ­­ the cases where there are

9

discretionary terms within a context is the

That's something

10

quintessential application of the covenant of good

faith.

12

A lot of the early covenant of good faith

claims involved outputs or requirements contracts, where

the specific amount in the contract was not set, and the

covenant was applied to that sort of situation.

terms.

the fact that, in many States, the covenant of good

faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but

22

is not read into employment contracts?

23

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think that that's a

24

situation that States struggle with, given the at­will

so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the

policy ­­ the rule of an implied covenant of good faith

it not to apply there.

has ­­ has sole discretion to determine whether to

9

terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program.

10
11

And,

So

what is the difference?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, it's a difference in

12

the context, and what the term "sole discretion" means

13

in different contexts is going to vary based on the

14

context and based on what someone entering into that

15

contract reasonably would have expected that contract to

16

mean, based on the terms of the contract.

17

So in the employment context, an employee,

18

given the wide acknowledgment of the at­will employment

19

doctrine, might not expect that they could only be

20

terminated for cause.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I imagine that
We

time, for a transportation company, we believe the price

2

must be fair and reasonable, and a contract in our

3

State, for transportation prices, has to set a fair and

4

reasonable price, and I personally think many fares are

5

not reasonable.

6

therefore, we have substituted the judges and the States

7

for setting prices instead of the parties.

8

They are too high.

All right.

All right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, so what is

13

your standard for distinguishing what is and is not

14

preempted where the State uses its contract law to imply

15

a fair and reasonable term?

16

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think our standard is very

17

similar to the one that the United States said.

18

about whether the covenant is going to ­­ whether the

19

claim is looking at whether the parties breached the

20

contract or whether it's looking at whether the contract

21

itself violated the law.

22

It's

So it's a question of whether the claim is

23

actually interpreting the contract and trying to get at

24

what the parties ­­ what their agreement was or whether

25

the claim is really that the contract, as the parties

38

agreed to it, violated the law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the supreme court

3

of the State had an opinion that says, we're going to be

4

candid about this, the covenant of fair dealing and good

5

faith, it's not in this contract, but we will read it

6

into every contract; that is, if the State supreme court

7

said, it's externally imposed, this is a rule that we

8

will read into every contract because of the policy in

9

our State that people should deal with each other

10
11

fairly.
Suppose that was the controlling decision of

12

the Minnesota supreme court.

13

right?

14

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Then you're out; is that

Yes.

If a State says that

15

it's imposing external notions of policy, that would

16

fall on the other side of the line drawn in Wolens,

17

which looked at enforcing terms of the agreement versus

18

imposing external State policies, but that ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would be weird, isn't

20

it, because in such a State, there might be a contract

21

where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit

22

term that limits something ­­ a very broad conferral of

23

discretion to operate.

24
25

And, yet, just because this State supreme
court has framed its argument in a particular kind of

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

way, they don't get the benefit of that.
MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think it would depend on

3

how the claim was framed and how the court interpreted

4

that claim and whether, in interpreting that claim, the

5

court was looking at the reasonable expectations of the

6

parties based on the terms of the contract and based on

7

their desire to be bound by an enforceable contract or

8

whether it thought it was imposing ­­ overriding the

9

parties' contract and imposing external notions of

10
11

fairness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's no

12

clearer than the ­­ the government's view, and it seems

13

to me to be a particular problem when you're talking

14

about the objectives of the ADA, to say that the rule

15

varies from State to State, particularly since, of

16

course, we're dealing with airlines that go to a lot of

17

different States.

18

I mean, it seems to me that the loosest

19

State, from the point of view of the preemption, is

20

going to set the standard.

21

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I don't think that ­­ that

22

the rule itself is varying from State to State.

23

that the rule would be the same across States, that when

24

a claim is ­­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes.

I think

It's a general

Official

rule that it depends upon the particular circumstances.

2

That's the same rule, but in its application, it

3

certainly varies from State to State.

4

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I don't think that it

5

necessarily would because, in all the States, a claim

6

that's seeking to get at the expectations and intents of

7

the parties would not be preempted, whereas one imposing

8

external notions of fairness would.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't what your ­­

10

your complaint that I think ­­ paragraph 56, which I

11

think is the key paragraph says, that the ­­ under

12

the ­­ the law is ­­ the contract law that you want to

13

enforce is, even where a party to a contract is given

14

absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in

15

good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable

16

expectations of the other party or parties.

17

Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting

18

to because, there, it sounds to me like I go in

19

to ­­ you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation

20

is they're not going to charge me what they're going to

there ­­ but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation,

23

and I'm the other party.

under State contract law, govern the price according to

Are you taking issue with the good faith and

20

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think there is a fair

21

amount of uniformity across the States in how they

22

actually apply the covenant of good faith and in terms

23

of applying it as an interpretation of the contract, and

24

then, especially, in cases where one party is claiming

25

that all of their performance under the contract is in

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their sole discretion and that they're free not to

2

perform under the contract at all ­­ you know,

essentially where the contract would be illusory in

circumstances to ensure that there is meaningful

performance that's required under the contract.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is an employment at­will

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I don't believe that's an

illusory contract.
But I think rather than it being important

12

whether there are specific ­­ whether specifically this

13

contract is illusory, I think the fact that one party is

14

claiming that it had no duty to perform under the

15

contract shows that the contract had reasonable implicit

16

limitations in it, that the parties would have

17

reasonably expected that they were contracting to there

18

being some sort of performance under the contract.

19

And, in fact, the principles at issue here

20

are remarkably similar to the principles that were at

21

issue in Wolens itself.

22

that those were contract construction issues.

And this Court there recognized

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, in Wolens, the

question was an express reservation of rights, and the

5

contract didn't say whether or not it applied

6

retroactively, so the question was whether there were

7

implied limitations on the express reservation of

a different result if it did not contain the words "in

exactly is the meaning of the sole discretion language.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

First, just a couple of loose ends.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

concession that I was referring to before is on

15

and 16 of the Red Brief.

16

the podium.

The
15

I think it was reiterated at

17

Also, this argument that, somehow, frequent

18

flyer miles programs have changed or something and are

19

different because there are partners, the same arguments

20

were made by the plaintiffs in Wolens, in their brief to

21

this Court, that, somehow, these don't relate to prices

22

and routes and services because you have rental cars and

23

hotels as partners, so I think this Court has already

24

crossed that bridge.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't want to take up ­­ I

2

don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but, if the

3

facts were that, under a particular program, 90 percent

4

of the miles were earned by purchasing things other than

5

flying and 90 percent of the miles were spent on things

6

other than flying, wouldn't that be very different?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not sure it would be

8

different in a ­­ in a claim brought against the

9

airlines.

I mean, maybe if you want to sue the credit

10

card partner, the ADA has nothing to do with that.

11

But I would say that, if you're suing an

12

airline, the Airline Deregulation Act speaks to it.

13

But, if the Court want to reserve that, I suppose it

14

could.

15

I do want to make ­­ underscore that the

16

Implied Covenant Doctrine is very different from other

17

interpretative tools.

18

in a world where you are trying to determine the

19

difference between self­imposed undertakings and things

20

imposed by State law, non­waivability is a huge strike

21

against it being voluntary.

22

It is non­waivable, and, I think,

It also just is ­­ you can bring in separate

23

implied covenant claims ­­ you know, no one ­­ I've

24

never heard of a contra proferentem claim, but an

25

implied covenant claim is routinely brought as a

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

separate claim.
It just shows you really can enlarge the

3

bargain in very real ways, and the States make policy

4

decisions about whether to have it.

5

implied covenants, as a general matter, at all.

Texas doesn't have

6

Some States have a valid public policy.

7

They have different views about at­will employment

8

contracts.

9

of good faith and fair dealing on the franchise

And, when Congress wanted to impose a duty

10

agreements between car manufacturers and automobile

11

dealers, they passed a statute.

12

policy oriented in a way that normal rules of

13

construction are not.

14

It's just statutory and

Now, Justice Breyer, I certainly agree with

15

your four premises.

16

would say the standard is that the implied covenant is

17

only not preempted when it does no more than provide a

18

rule of construction for the express terms of the

19

contract.

20

If I had to state a standard, I

But, of course, if that's all it does, then

21

there's nothing to be gained by saying those claims are

22

not preempted because you can still just get to the same

23

place by citing Cardozo and Lady Duff­Gordon.

24
25

And there's a lot to be gained by adopting a
more prophylactic rule because the claims that are

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

brought in the real world are claims that I get a refund

2

even though the ticket's nonrefundable.

3

even though the loss limit was 500.

4

for redirecting my packages, even though it was in your

5

sole discretion.

6

I get $1,000,

I get to sue you

So in the real world, the implied covenant

7

claims are elastic and provide a basis for bringing the

8

kind of claims that courts have almost uniformly

9

correctly recognized are preempted.

10

The last question I ask you to think about

11

is:

12

as express covenants?

13

and not say sole discretion unless it violates

14

reasonable norms of community standards and decency?

15

Why is it the airlines don't put these covenants in
Why do they say sole discretion

Well, the reason is you can't run a

16

national, let alone international airline, if every one

17

of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off

18

or taking out an abusive customer is going to be

19

second­guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards

20

of ordinary decency and morality.

21

So, for that reason, we think the judgment

22

below should be reversed, and we would urge you to apply

23

a more prophylactic rule.

24

Thank you.
