ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REGAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I represent Manuel Jose Lozano, a father who

11

loves his daughter.

12

and concealed her from Mr. Lozano, first in the United

13

Kingdom, for nearly eight months; then in France, then

14

in the United States.

15

Respondent kidnapped that daughter

In Abbott, this Court recognized child

16

abduction to be one of the worst forms of child abuse

17

and that the Convention, therefore, aims to deter and

18

prevent child abduction from occurring in the first

19

instance.

20

contrast, the rule adopted by the Second Circuit

21

provides a playbook for thwarting the Convention ­­

22

Equitable tolling furthers that aim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

By

Mr. ­­ Mr. Regan, you ­­

23

you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field,

24

family law, where the interest of the child is always of

25

paramount importance and running all through family law

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is ­­ is that concern.

2

very large.

And changed circumstances figure

3

So decrees that might be final in another

4

area of law are not because, if circumstances change,

5

then the child custody may change.

6

that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling

7

that would leave out consideration of the child's best

8

interests.

9

MR. REGAN:

So it seems to me

Justice Ginsburg, we believe

10

that equitable tolling does provide, within the context

11

of the Convention, consideration ­­ the opportunity for

12

courts to consider the interests of the child.

13

that's most poignantly illustrated by some of the cases

14

in which it has been applied.

15

And

If I may provide an example, an example in

16

Respondent's brief, Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch, on

17

page 31 of their brief, it's a case in which the Court

18

found equitable tolling is available, and it found

19

equitable tolling applied factually.

20

however, considered the facts and circumstances of the

21

child's life, including those facts and circumstances

22

that relate to the extent to which the child is settled.

23

The Court,

But it considered those facts and

24

circumstances within the rubric of the Article 13

25

analysis, and that is consistent with what other courts

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have done in what I would ­­ what I would term more

2

natural Article 12 ­­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that equitable

4

discretion, or is that still equitable tolling?

5

Because, as I understand equitable tolling, if it

6

applies and, say, there's a 6­month suspension, the

7

child must go back, so that there's ­­ so that the ­­

8

that the weighing that you're talking about just

9

doesn't ­­ doesn't come into play.

10

MR. REGAN:

Thank you, Justice Kennedy.

And

11

I think this is important because I think this ­­ this

12

illustrates how foreign courts have miscomprehended

13

equitable tolling, how it would operate ­­ how it

14

operates within the context of the convention.

15

Equitable tolling would prevent the

16

abducting parent from taking advantage of the Article

17

12.2 exception, that ­­ that the child should not be

18

returned because the child is now ­­ because the parent

19

has met that minimal routine showing of the child is now

20

settled.

21

friends, so on and so forth, that they are living a

22

normal life here.

He's going to school, he or she is ­­ has some

23

What it does not prevent ­­ and Mendez

24

illustrates this, as do other cases ­­ it does not

25

prevent the Court from looking at the Article 13

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

considerations.

2

cases, the Court will still consider if the child ­­ if

3

the child is of sufficient age and maturity to testify,

4

such that, if this Court should take into account his or

5

her views or objections to return, the Court can do so.

6
7

So, for example, as in Mendez and other

Excuse me.

Article 13 is at 136a.

135a is ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And ­­ and it does

21

provide ­­ just while people are looking at it, it does

22

provide that, even though there's, in your view,

23

equitable tolling, there are still circumstances in

24

which the child would not go back, if there's a grave ­­

25

grave risk?

Grave risk of harm.
Grave risk of harm to the

child.
MR. REGAN:

Or if the court finds that it

would be an intolerable situation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, again, as Justice

7

Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are

8

two different axes here.

9

the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so

One is the best interest of

10

that parents don't abduct.

11

very often, if at all.

12

MR. REGAN:

But those axes don't cross

I respect, Justice Kennedy, it's

13

difficult to balance them.

14

incommensurate or ­­ you know, competing considerations

15

or ­­ but both very important.

16

tolling properly balances them within the structure of

17

the Convention because equitable tolling, again, it ­­

18

it prevents this Article 12.2 exception, but it doesn't

19

prevent the Article 13 exception.

They're somewhat

We think that equitable

20

In fact, in many ways, what we're talking

21

about is not inconsistent with what the English court

22

does or did in Cannon.

23

where there is concealment and subterfuge, there will be

24

a heightened burden for establishing settlement.

25

In Cannon, the court said if ­­

Now, in this ­­

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that still ­­ but

2

Article 13 still is different from what's in the best

3

interest of the child.

4

MR. REGAN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think ­­
Now, it's true that all

6

we're talking about is for the ­­ during the time in

7

which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take

8

years, and expert witnesses are not available or readily

9

available.

10

MR. REGAN:

Well, Justice Kennedy, to your

11

point about timing and essentially provisional return, I

12

do think ­­ you know, courts ­­ district courts have

13

shown great adeptness at dealing with those issues.

14

They've entered conditional orders that require the

15

child be returned at a time when the proceeding ­­ when

16

the testimony is necessary.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Excuse me.

Let me give you

this example.

So that, if there's equitable tolling, the

But during those 10 years, the child has

24

become very well settled in the new country, has learned

25

the language of that country, the customs developed,

2

Under ­­ if there is no equitable tolling,

3

but the abduction can be taken into account under the

4

doctrine of equitable discretion, that's ­­ that's one

5

thing.

6

Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the

7

petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the

8

conditions in Article 13 was met, for example, a grave

9

risk that the child's return would expose the child to

But the way you read this, the way you read the

10

physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the

11

child in an intolerable situation, then there would

12

be ­­ then the child would have to be removed.

13

So there is that major difference, isn't

14
15

there, between those two positions?
MR. REGAN:

There is a significant

16

difference.

17

difference is warranted and necessary in order to

18

achieve the effect of deterrence because the Second

19

Circuit's rule essentially says to abducting parents, if

20

you abduct your child and you conceal your child for 12

21

months, you will be rewarded.

22

And we think that that significant

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's true.

The

23

position of the Respondent and the government would give

24

a great incentive for parents to abduct children and

25

hide them for a period of time.

But on the other side,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as my example, I think, illustrates, your rule would

2

mean that a child who is very well settled in a

3

particular location would have to be returned to the

4

other country for purposes of the custody determination.

5

So why do you think the Convention should be

6
7

read one way, rather than the other?
MR. REGAN:

Justice Alito, I hope to make

8

abundantly clear that our position, equitable tolling,

9

would not mandate that that child be returned.

10

All it

does ­­ but it's significant ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. REGAN:

Well, how would it not?
It ­­ it changes the question

13

that the court asks.

14

courts ­­ the question on which ­­ the question before

15

the court is, is this child settled?

16

the courts looked at ­­ the courts have looked at it,

17

and it really ­­ they're ­­ you know, "settlement" is

18

not defined in the Convention, and Congress has left it

example cited in our brief, cited by the Solicitor

That's a natural Article 12.1 case.

The Second Circuit looked at ­­ or Judge

7

Chin ­­ then­Judge Chin in the district court, looked at

8

the child's facts and circumstances related to

9

settlement as part of that grave risk analysis.

There

10

was expert testimony, as there often is in these cases,

11

that the child was suffering from potential ­­ from

12

post­traumatic stress disorder.

13

Experts testified that return of the

14

child ­­ the child should not be returned because it

15

presented a grave risk of harm to the child.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

harm.
MR. REGAN:

That's correct.

And there are

cases, Mendez v. Lynch and others.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It might be now and then,

21

but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave

22

you, I don't see how there's any ­­ any reason at all

23

not to yank the child back from wherever he's been for 10

24

years.

But in a sense, what

you're saying is that it's not an automatic ­­ it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

I understand that point.

However, there is a difference.

9

Convention have found is the proper balance, is not for

And so what we're

10

courts to say, well, let's try and figure out what the

best interests are.

In fact, the Convention couldn't be clearer,

13

and Congress couldn't have been clearer that that is not

14

where it ­­ that's where it least wanted courts wading

15

into those waters.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Convention says, in the

17

preamble, that the parties ­­ that's countries ­­ are

18

firmly convinced that the interests of the children are

19

of paramount importance in matters relating to their

20

custody.

21

you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would

22

returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological

23

harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable

24

position.

Okay?

your idea is to send the child back to the husband

the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying

22

that's what it really means and otherwise against you.

Well, Mr. Regan, aside

3

from the position of the United States, which ­­ which

4

has changed, you made that point, the determination

5

that's being made at this stage is really one of venue.

6

It's where the main bout will be fought out.

7

don't want that to linger for a long time.

8

decision to be made with dispatch.

9

And so we
We want that

And as one of the amici brief informs us,

10

many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be

11

badly abused women and if you ­­ if they had to go under

12

Article 13, then they would have this full­blown, was he

13

really the abuser?

14

that question is reserved for the main ­­ for the main

15

bout.

Doing it without equitable tolling,

16

I suppose if we had a case where the judge

17

isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge

18

would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue

19

determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation.

20

MR. REGAN:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, the

21

domestic violence situation, which I am entirely

22

sensitive to and appreciate, illustrates the difficulty

23

of these cases and ­­ and that courts can't really

24

figure out what's ­­ who's right or who did what in

25

these circumstances.

Most of ­­ usually all of the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

evidence is overseas on that issue.
What the Convention ­­ the approach the

3

Convention decides on taking is that, first, there is no

4

self­help remedy certainly for concealment, that ­­ that

5

nothing excuses concealment of the child.

6

to the extent you said there's a goal and a value of

7

shortening these proceedings, to the extent equitable

8

tolling disincentivizes concealment, it does that.

9

I mean, the opposite rule says, if you

And, in fact,

10

conceal, i.e., you extend that period of time during

11

which there's no relationship, you'll be rewarded.

12

It's an enormous incentive.

And our point

13

is there is the proper safety valve.

14

Article 12.2 is so pedestrian, it is essentially have

15

you failed to be ­­ aside from abducting your child,

about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that,

that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents'

and the child's.

And there was lengthy discussion

8

And you're right, they had other provisions

MR. REGAN:

To reverse the Second Circuit's holding and

19

Your Honors, we ended on a note of drafting

20

history, and to return to Justice Sotomayor's question

21

about turning that a bit on its head, I agree.

22

drafting history specifically shows that the countries

23

considered two periods, one of prompt return, return

centrally to children who are abducted.

isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, all right.

Perhaps

16

that's the solution to the problem then.

17

you would accept that, that there is no equitable

18

tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but

19

abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the

20

return, that weighs against the failure to return the

21

child, not just something that can be disposed of in a

22

sentence, which is basically what the district court did

23

here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into

account in the exercise of equitable discretion.

So how are we supposed to decide between

to address the one point that the Petitioner raised of the,

Justice Scalia.
What's the government's

12

position on ­­ on this question we've just been

discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether

14

there is discretion even within Article 12, even though

15

specific elements of discretion are contained in Article

16

13?

17

MS. O'CONNELL:

It's our position that,

18

under Article 12, there is discretion to return a

19

settled child and that that comes from Article 12

20

itself.

21

says that, if more than a year has passed, the court

shall order the return of the child, unless the child is

23

settled in her new environment.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why doesn't the context

11

include Section 13, which ­­ which lists specific

12

reasons why you can depart from 12?

13

very strange to say, and in addition to that, there's a

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

presumption that a settled child will stay, right?

4

You're just saying, once you've found a settled child,

5

the obligation to return the child goes away, but at

6

that point, it really is a kind of "all things

7

considered" inquiry, with no presumption operating at

8

all, just in light of the purposes of the treaty?

9

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I think the ­­ the

10

last part, Justice Kagan, is the most important part,

11

that it has to be guided by the objectives of the

12

treaty; that it's not a free­wheeling, best interests of

13

the child analysis or where this child should be, but

14

you could take into account the principle in Article 12,

15

that it's harmful to uproot a settled child, but you can

also weigh against that the idea that this Convention is

really geared in the first place toward preventing

abduction.

that discretion could be abused if a child has been in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, whatever fears

say my clerks have only found two published decisions in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, if we're going

to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of

international weight is that abduction is one factor for

MS. O'CONNELL:

Typically, the left­behind

parent will approach the central authority in his or her

own country and typically with an idea of what the

22

abducting parent's connections are to other countries.

23

And so, if the United States is singled out as a country

24

to which the child might have been taken, the Mexican

25

central authority would contact the United States
