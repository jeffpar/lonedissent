ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PARTIES

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a Federal Government agency compelled

14

employers to provide something as religiously sensitive

15

as contraception, it knew that free exercise in RFRA

16

claims would soon follow.

17

In particular, the agency itself provided

18

exemptions and accommodations for the religious exercise

19

of a subset ­­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your claim limited to

21

sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it

22

include items like blood transfusion, vaccines?

23

some religions, products made of pork?

24

under your theory that has a religious basis, could an

25

employer preclude the use of those items as well?

Alderson Reporting Company

For

Is any claim

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, the

2

first step in the analysis would be to ask whether or

3

not there's a substantial burden on religious exercise.

4

I do think this case is, in a sense, easier than most of

5

the examples that you've brought up because here's one

6

where it's so religiously sensitive, so fraught with

7

religious controversy, that the agency itself provides a

8

certain number of exemptions and accommodations.

9

that's one way, I think, that you'd address the first

10

step of the question here.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

Well, I mean, just take one

12

of the things that Justice Sotomayor asked about, which

13

is vaccinations, because there are many people who have

14

religious objections to vaccinations.

15

employer does and ­­ and refuses to fund or wants not to

16

fund vaccinations for her employees, what ­­ what

17

happens then?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

So suppose an

Well, if we assume we get past

19

the substantial burden step of the analysis, then the

20

next step of the analysis is the compelling interest and

21

least restrictive alternatives analysis.

22

would have to be analyzed on its own.

23

context of vaccinations, the government may have a

24

stronger compelling interest than it does in this

25

context because there are notions of herd immunity and

Alderson Reporting Company

And every case

I do think in the

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

the like that give the government a particularly

2

compelling interest in trying to maximize the number ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Blood transfusions?
Blood transfusions.

Again,

5

each one of these cases, I think would have to be

6

evaluated on its own and apply the compelling

7

interest­least restrictive alternative test and the

8

substantial burdens part of the test.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So really, every medical

10

treatment.

11

there are quite a number of medical treatments that

12

difference religious groups object to.

13

group could opt out of this and another religious group

14

could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal

15

and nothing would be uniform.

16

And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that

MR. CLEMENT:

So one religious

Well ­­ well, Justice Kagan,

17

nothing could be clearer than when Congress passed RFRA

18

Congress made a judgment that RFRA was going to apply to

19

all manner of Federal statutes.

20

Congress ­­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think what the

Mr. Clement, maybe it

22

seemed clear then, but since RFRA, just as before RFRA,

23

Congress has continued to write into Federal legislation

24

specific religious exemptions for some, but not

25

everybody, for individuals, sometimes religious

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

institutions.

2

took care of it all, why did Congress continue after

3

RFRA to pass these laws focusing the exemption on an

4

individual, religious institution?

5

your argument, all of those laws ­­ and there are more

6

than half a dozen ­­ were unnecessary.

7

the books, Congress didn't have to do that any more.

8
9

So if it was all that clear that RFRA

MR. CLEMENT:

Those, as I take

Once RFRA was on

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm

not sure that they were all unnecessary.

And of course,

10

in a variety of contexts, Congress may proceed on a belt

11

and suspenders matters.

12

different questions.

13

was RFRA just done with creating other exemptions.

14

I think the answer to that is no.

15

question that Justice Kagan's question brought up is,

16

was Congress evident and did Congress specifically

17

consider whether RFRA would apply across the board to

18

all the provisions of 18 U.S.C., or rather all the

19

provisions of the United States Code.

20

could not have been clearer that it was passing a

21

statute that it wanted to apply to all preexisting

22

statutes and to all subsequent statutes unless Congress

23

specifically provided otherwise.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think there's really two

One is when Congress passed RFRA,
And

But I think the

And Congress

You were beginning by

giving us a framework for your argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

Do I think of

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

this as a statutory case?

2

Amendment is on the stage at some point here, but I take

3

it you can prevail just on the question of statutory

4

interpretation, and if that is so, are there any

5

statutory rules that work in your favor, that is to say,

6

avoiding a constitutional question or how do we think

7

about this case, primarily as a statutory case?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

Of course, the First

Obviously, one of my clients

9

has before you right now a free exercise claim and my

10

other client has a free exercise claim that's live in

11

the lower courts.

12

I, think, as your question points out, this Court

13

really, first and foremost, can decide this on the basis

14

of the Federal statute, and the Ashwander principles of

15

constitutional avoidance seem like they would be sort of

16

fully applicable to the Court's consideration of that

17

question.

18

statutory construction would certainly point you to the

19

answer to the first objection the government raises,

20

which is do persons include for­profit corporations

21

because ­­

22

So those issues are preserved.

But

And then, of course, the normal principles of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, isn't this a

23

special kind of statute?

24

specifically refers back to a body of constitutional

25

law.

Because this is a statute that

It basically says we want to get right back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

place that we were with respect to religious claims

2

before Employment Division v. Smith.

3

it's not ­­ you know, it's a statute that directs us to

4

a body of constitutional law.

5

And so we have ­­

That body of constitutional law is, I think,

6

very different from the one you portray in your brief.

7

It suggests that accommodations should be made

8

sometimes, but rarely, and subject to a ­­ to a

9

balancing analysis, not to a compelling interest

10

standard in the way we would use it for, say, race

11

discrimination.

12

response to that?

13

So, you know, what's ­­ what's the

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, first, Justice Kagan,

14

let me take a little bit of an issue with your premise

15

and let me try to responsive to your question anyways

16

after I do that.

17

premise is that when Congress first passed the statute

18

RFRA, it talked about free exercise as defined in the

19

Court's cases.

20

RLUIPA, which is a later statute, it actually confronted

21

some lower court cases that had limited RFRA and tried

22

to impose a centrality requirement.

23

want that.

24

the pre­Smith free exercise cases.

25

amended the statute to broaden it so it now protects any

How I'd like to take issue with your

And then at the time that it passed

And Congress didn't

It didn't want to take all the baggage of

Alderson Reporting Company

So it actually

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

exercise of religion.

2

premise that RFRA simply picks up everything that ever

3

happened pre­Smith.

4

So I would take issue with your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there ­­ there's

5

another respect in which this, even as originally

6

enacted, does not track the ­­ the preemployment

7

Division v. Smith law.

8

compelling State interest test in the prior cases was

9

never accompanied by a least restrictive alternative

10

requirement.

11

law.

12

That is to say, the ­­ the

That was an invention of this ­­ of this

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's fair, Justice

13

Scalia.

14

to sort of get at this statute the way that Justice

15

Kagan is suggesting is that not everybody exactly agreed

16

as to what the pre­Smith case law was.

17

the pre­Smith case law in your opinion in a certain way.

18

Justice O'Connor described the pre­Smith case law in

19

another way.

20

say, as Justice Kagan's question would suggest, that

21

rather than just apply the statute as written, we should

22

really sort of just go back and apply pre­Smith laws if

23

this were ­­

24
25

One of the things that you run into if you try

So it's a little bit difficult to try to

Well, it is applying the

3

what we mean.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

It says:

That's

5

Kagan, in the purpose part of the statute it says:

we mean to do here is basically restore the pre­Smith

9

think this Court should apply, as Justice Scalia

But it also accompanies that purpose statute with

10

suggests, applies broadly to any exercise of religion by

any person and then suggests that the relevant test is

the substantial burden part of the test.

14

it's ­­

MR. CLEMENT:

It

And that ­­ that was rejected.
Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

5

would suggest to the contrary.

6

was such unanimity behind RFRA in the first place is

7

that efforts to limit it to just certain subclasses,

8

subsets of religious freedom claims, were rejected and

9

sort of everybody in Congress got together and said, all

The reason that there

10

right, you have some claims you actually want to be

11

vindicated, you have some claims you want to be

12

vindicated, we'll vindicate all of them.

13

going to look at any legislative history as shedding

14

light on this, then I would suggest you look at

15

Professor Laycock's brief, which goes into great detail

16

about the legislative debates involved in ­­ that led up

17

ultimately to the passage of RLUIPA.

18

was trying to pass a broader statute, the RLPA, the

19

Religious Liberty Protection Act, the issue of the

20

statute's application and RFRA's application to

21

for­profit corporations was squarely put at issue by the

22

Nadler Amendment.

23

the House report that demonstrates the rejection of that

24

amendment could not be clearer that they understood that

25

for­profit corporations would be covered.

And if we're

And when Congress

And that amendment was rejected and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

Now, in fairness, what they understood is

2

that we were probably talking about in the real world a

3

relatively small set of corporations like an

4

incorporated kosher market or kosher deli of the kind

5

that this Court had before it in the Crown Kosher case.

6

And so I think it's ­­ you know, we can talk about the

7

extent and how you'd apply these principles to Exxon,

8

but I think that's just something that's not going to

9

happen in the real world.

It is no accident that the

10

claims that you have before you in these cases are

11

brought by small closely­held corporations that have

12

firmly held religious beliefs.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, again, Mr. Clement as

14

Justice Ginsburg said, this was a very uncontroversial

15

law.

16

interpretation of it, would essentially subject the

17

entire U.S. Code to the highest test in constitutional

18

law, to a compelling interest standard.

19

employer comes in and that employer says, I have a

20

religious objection to sex discrimination laws; and then

21

another employer comes in, I have a religious objection

22

to minimum wage laws; and then another, family leave;

23

and then another, child labor laws.

24

subject to the exact same test which you say is this

25

unbelievably high test, the compelling interest standard

Your understanding of this law, your

Alderson Reporting Company

So another

And all of that is

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

with the least restrictive alternative.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't say that.

I

3

think Congress said that.

4

can to your question, the parade of horribles that the

5

government offers you ought to sound familiar, because

6

if you look at that parade of horribles ­­ Social

7

Security, minimum wage, discrimination laws, compelled

8

vaccination ­­ every item on that list was included in

9

Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Smith.

But to be as responsive as I

And

10

Justice O'Connor responded to that in her separate

11

opinion and she said, look, you've got to trust the

12

courts; just because free exercise claims are being

13

brought doesn't mean that the courts can't separate the

14

sheep from the goats.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, whatever ­­
Well, she had an

16

understanding of how the Court worked pre­Smith that was

17

a kind of Sherbert v. Verner­Yoder understanding, which

18

was we did a balancing, we looked at the government's

19

interests, we took those very seriously, especially to

20

the extent that there was harm to identifiable third

21

parties and that it fell on an identifiable third party.

22

That was basically ­­ you could not get an accommodation

23

for that kind of harm.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, what she said and

whatever the merits of it as a matter of constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

debate isn't relevant.

2

is that Congress clearly preferred one side of that

3

debate and thought courts could handle this.

4

What ­­ what I think is relevant

So then the question becomes:

How do courts

5

actually apply this test?

6

the test to recognize this case, where I think the

7

government has an incredibly weak case on compelling

8

interest and least restrictive alternatives, which they

9

almost don't want to talk about at all, is going to

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if I could talk about

Well, could I ask you this,

13

Mr. Clement.

14

on the books, has any of these claims involving minimum

15

wage, for example, been brought and have they succeeded?

16

In ­­ in all the years since RFRA has been

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Alito, very few of

17

these claims have been brought.

18

succeeded, and that's notwithstanding the fact that all

19

of these statutes we're talking about apply to employers

20

generally.

21

brought or they haven't succeeded notwithstanding the

22

fact that the government concedes that sole

23

proprietorships and partnerships and nonprofit

24

corporations are all protected by RFRA.

25

Very few of them have

And it ­­ and none of those claims have been

Now, millions of Americans are employed by

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

proprietorships, partnerships, and nonprofits.

2

these statutes really were on a collision course, I

3

think we would have seen the collision already.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if

Well, with respect,

5

Mr. Clement, I think that that's probably because the

6

Court has had a different understanding of what RFRA

7

does and the kind of analysis that it requires courts to

8

perform than you're arguing for in this case.

9

your argument were adopted and there was a strict

That if

10

scrutiny standard of the kind that usually applies and a

11

least restrictive alternative requirement, then you

12

would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork

13

with respect to all of these laws.

14

that there ­­ and I think this is absolutely right when

15

you say it ­­ that you ­­ you cannot test the centrality

16

of a belief to a religion, you cannot test the sincerity

17

of religion.

18

their hands would be bound when faced with all these

19

challenges if your standard applies.

20

And because you say

I think a court would be, you know ­­

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, a couple

21

of thoughts.

22

Court has never had a RFRA case that it applied the

23

standard on the merits.

24

Court applied something that very much felt to the

25

government at the time as being strict scrutiny.

First of all, I mean, it's not like this

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if I may, Justice

11

Ginsburg, there's two separate questions.

12

question about how to apply the test if it's applicable

13

in a particular case, and I think O Centro is the

14

starting place for guidance on that.

15

There's a

Your question also brings up the separate

16

question about the coverage of the statute.

17

that, I think the place to start is the statute itself,

18

which broadly provides coverages to persons.

not an incidental term.

21

specifically applies to all corporations, to joint

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And as to

That is

It's a term that picks up

are the cases that show that a corporation exercises

religion?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

But where

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

5

those ­­ those cases ­­ I mean, I'd start with cases

6

like Lukumi or O Centro, which all involved

7

corporations, and nobody thought it was particularly

8

problematic there that the plaintiffs before the court

9

were artificial entities.

10

And I suppose you could

take ­­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but they were

12

really arguing about things that affected their

13

membership, not them as a corporate entity.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm not sure that you

15

can so easily divide the two, and we can talk about how

16

it is with corporations generally.

17

the corporation has certain beliefs or certain intent, a

19

issues of trying to figure out what kind of intent or

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

And, Justice

be the same basic way you approach other questions of

which is ultimately, I think this line of questioning

17

goes to a question of sincerity, and if some large

corporation asserts some claim that's going to save them

those kind of cases is really going to resist the

MR. CLEMENT:

To be clear, this Court's

3

cases have always distinguished between the sincerity

4

inquiry, which the Court has allowed, and the centrality

5

inquiry, which it suggested is inappropriate.

6

sincerity has always been a part of this Court's cases.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

I thought more

8

importantly was whether a burden was substantial or not.

9

That we've never acceded to the person claiming a

10

religious exemption, a belief in how substantial the

11

burden might be.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

This Court has not

13

questioned that.

14

common ground the idea that you don't really

15

second­guess the person's ­­ the person's belief, but

16

you can contest sincerity.

17

in this.

18

19

assert that they belong to the church of marijuana, and

20

those cases do get litigated and they get rejected.

21

there's a lot of different ways to ­­

22

The Thomas case, I think, puts as

It is ­­ there is case law

You know, you have people who are arrested in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Is there ­­ is there a

23

different way of looking at it, the leeway?

24

Lee, we said, "When followers of a particular sect enter

25

into a commercial activity as a matter of choice, the

Alderson Reporting Company

In U.S. v.

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

21
1

limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of

2

conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the

3

statutory schemes which are binding on others in that

4

activity."

5

So isn't that really the answer, that we've

6

never considered a for­profit corporation as exercising

7

religion?

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
Lee first.

Well, let me ­­ let me take on

And I mean, that's obviously the two lines

10

of Lee that are the government's favorite two lines in

11

Lee.

12

which is where most of these sincerity questions go.

13

And Lee definitely says that there is a sincere

14

religious belief and a substantial burden on religious

15

exercise.

16

But Lee starts with a substantial burden inquiry,

So the two sentences that you're quoting

17

come in the compelling interest analysis of the case.

18

And I think Lee does stand for the proposition that in

19

the tax context, it's going to be very hard for somebody

20

to bring a claim that satisfies even the demanding

21

compelling interest, least restrictive alternative test.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's an

23

interesting question, because the briefs on both sides

24

here are written as if the penalty for not having a

25

health insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at

2

about, which is paying the tax, which is a lot less than

3

a penalty and a lot less than ­­ than the cost of health

4

insurance at all?

5

give health insurance and pay not that high a penalty ­­

6

not that high a tax.

7

But isn't there another choice nobody talks

These employers could choose not to

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, just to put this in

8

concrete terms, for Hobby Lobby, for example, the choice

9

is between paying a 500 ­­ a $475 million per year

10

penalty and paying a $26 million per year coverage.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I don't think that

12

that's the same thing, Mr. Clement.

13

that is if the employer continues to provide health

14

insurance without this part of the coverage, but Hobby

15

Lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at

all.

17

employee, which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays

18

to provide insurance to its employees.

19

So there is a choice here.

There's one penalty

And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay $2,000 per

20

penalty by ­­ in the language of the statute.

21

payment or a tax.

22

question is, why is there a substantial burden at all?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

There's a choice.

It's a

And so the

Well, just to be clear, we

24

were talking about the same thing.

25

choice, is between paying a $475 million a year penalty

You know, Hobby Lobby is

paying something right now for the ­­ for the coverage.

8

It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the

There are employers all over the United

MR. CLEMENT:

And it has been treated for

And I think for this

7

And if I could finish the thought about why it's

8

a false comparison, the 2,000 penalty to the cost of the

health insurance, is that it's going to very much hurt

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I actually think what it's

like, Your Honor, with all due respect, it's like the

3

five dollar penalty enforcing the prohibition in Yoder.

4

And what this Court says, it's one thing if you don't

have a direct government prohibition on a religious

exercise or a mandate that somebody do something that

7

violates their religion.

the substantial pressure, and it becomes a little bit

Here's the problem with this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27
1

way of looking at it, which is to say whatever it costs

2

per employee to get this, this health care, that's

3

something that right now Hobby Lobby is paying whatever

4

it's paying them, plus it's ­­ it's ­­ you know, imputed

5

into that is the idea that they're getting their wage

and they're getting health care insurance.

they are going to have to increase the wages to make up

9

for that.

And they're going to have to pay the $2,000

complaints and you go back to our briefs, you know, it's

never making that claim.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I thought that you were

I didn't have to make that

claim in the course of this litigation.

6

pointing out, though, is for purposes of the substantial

burden analysis, it is perfectly appropriate to take

8

into account that the 2,000 ­­ the $26 million in fines

What I'm

10

would lose out if they are on that horn of the dilemma.

11

They would also lose out all the additional wages they

12

would have to pay, and they would be in this position of

not offering health care, which is something they

believe is important for their religion as well.

than saying that their religious beliefs mandate them to

that the health insurance that they're providing is not

adequate, it's not the full package.

You know, I'm sure they seem

MR. CLEMENT:

Congress has said is that this kind of plan is not

appropriate for a non­grandfathered plan.

25

going to talk about the government's compelling

Alderson Reporting Company

But if we're

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

interests here, which I think has got to be part of the

2

analysis, then I think the grandfathered provisions of

3

this statute really are devastating for the government's

4

argument that it has a compelling interest.

5

When the government pursues compelling

6

interest, it demands immediate compliance.

7

say, "Get around to it whenever it's convenient."

8

can't imagine Congress passing Title VII and saying,

9

"Stop discriminating on the basis of race, unless of

It doesn't
I

10

course you have a preexisting policy that discriminates

11

on the basis of race, and then you can keep it as long

initially Title VII did not apply to any employers with

fewer than 25 employees.

21

brought the number down because Congress realized that

22

there were going to be transition issues and that some

23

time was needed to make sure that the compelling

24

interest, you know, should be applied uniformly across

25

all employers.

And then gradually, Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

31
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Here's, respectfully, why I

2

don't think that that works, which is I think the

3

question whenever there are exemptions in the statute is

4

to ask yourself, do the exemptions undermine the

5

compelling interest that the government asserts.

6

There's nothing inconsistent with an

7

interest in prohibiting employment discrimination to say

8

we're going to focus on the people who actually employ

9

the most people and therefore can engage in the most

10
11

discrimination.
It's quite a different matter, and I don't

12

think anybody would think that Congress would pass a

13

Title VII that said, "Hey, as long as you have a

14

preexisting discriminatory policy, you're allowed to

15

keep it."

16

consistent.

17

That doesn't seem like it would be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, your

18

attorney ­­ one of the attorneys below on behalf of your

19

clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't

20

going to be around very long because any change to an

21

existing policy ­­ and he said these changes happen on a

22

yearly basis.

23

statistics that it's up to 40 percent now have

24

grandfathered out.

25

and that's why it's not grandfathered.

And we already know from the government's

Your own client changed its policy,

2

And he changed it to drop contraceptives it
was covering.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
And so my point is,

5

since when does a transitioned grandfathered exemption

6

and one that everybody knows will have to change,

7

because premiums by definition will change or co­pays

8

will change, something is going to change ­­ it's a very

9

short transition period.

10
11

Since when does that prove

that the need is not compelling?
MR. CLEMENT:

With all due respect, it's not

12

necessarily a very short transition period.

13

your references to co­pays and premiums is precisely on

14

point, because the government, through its regulations,

15

has allowed grandfathered plans to make changes to the

16

co­pays as long as they're indexed to medical inflation.

And your ­­

17

Now, if you have a transition period that's

18

just there for a nanosecond, you don't bother indexing

19

it to medical inflation.

20

provision that's going to be around for multiple years.

21

And by the government's own numbers, tens of millions of

22

employees are not getting this mandated coverage as a

23

result of the grandfather provision.

24

project forward ten years to when maybe there would only

25

be a handful of grandfathered plans, even at that point,

So this is a grandfather

Alderson Reporting Company

And even if we can

you would still have the same problem that the

2

government would have, which is it has to make an

3

argument for a compelling interest.

20

things I'd like to say about that, if it's possible.

third­party burdens is you have to ask where are they

from an employer ­­ I mean, an employer right now can

3

government.

4

That's not as

So that's one principle to think about.

Another principle, and this is more of a

5

detail, but I think it's important, is that to the

6

extent you take into account third­party burdens, you

7

take those into account in the compelling interest part

8

of the analysis.

9

somehow third­party interests go into the substantial

The government has an argument that

25

And the one thing that has

The ­­ and the

brings me to my third point, which is those other

Alderson Reporting Company

35
1

significant interests that carry the most weight have to

2

be independent of the very statute that's at issue in

3

the case and that the party seeks an exemption from.

4

So if you think about the Caldor case, there

5

the Court was concerned with the third­party burdens on,

6

say, an employee who had a seniority right to take the

7

weekends off.

8

take the weekend off, and the government policy was

coming in and displacing this.

when they're talking about third­party burdens there,

what the Court is really talking about is the ­­ the

I mean, Mr. Clement, isn't

As he said, "Limitations which of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

point that Justice Jackson made in Prince, I submit, is

the point that this Court made unanimously in Cutter.

2

rights and interests of third parties.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, is it your argument

4

that providing the accommodation that's requested here

5

would violate the Establishment Clause?

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's not our argument

7

that it would violate the Establishment Clause.

8

is our argument that you ­­ in any RFRA case, including

Avoidance is one of them.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, what the court ­­ what the Congress said in

to work, was that it was to strike a sensible balance

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I ­­ first of all, I

disagree with respect to Lee, that one of the points

Now, does the government have a position on
whether corporations have a race?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

We think those are

correct and that this situation is different.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

corporation does have a race for purposes of

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, not that the

2

corporation has a race, but that corporations can bring

3

those claims.

situation, all you're interpreting is the word "person"

5

in a statute, not exercise of religion, which is what

6

makes it different here.

7
8
9
10

But you're not interpreting ­­ in that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So those ­­ those

cases involve construction of the term "person"?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, but only "person."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the person ­­ the

11

corporation can bring as a person a claim of racial

12

discrimination.

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's correct, but not

14

exercise of religion.

15

me, if I could, we think that part of the problem here

16

and the reason we make the argument we do at the

17

threshold about why you ought not recognize claims under

18

RFRA for for­profit corporations is that they are going

19

to predictively give rise to the kinds of issues you

20

have in this case in which the exemption is going to

21

impose a burden on third parties or extinguish rights of

22

third parties, employees or others, and that that ­­

23

that really can't be what Congress was thinking about.

24

But even if you ­­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the difference.

But let

If you say they can't even

get their ­­ they can't even get their ­­ their day in

2

court, you're saying something pretty, pretty strong.

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I understand, but if

4

Your Honor disagrees with me ­­ if the Court doesn't

5

agree with this position at the threshold, the same

6

considerations with respect to the harms of third

7

parties definitely play into the compelling­interest

8

analysis.

9

In fact, under RFRA, the standard, the

10

precise standard of the statute says the government must

11

meet is that it must show that the application of the

12

law to the particular parties here, Conestoga and Hobby

13

Lobby, is in furtherance of the government's compelling

14

interest.

15

whether having Hobby Lobby and Conestoga provide this

16

coverage is in furtherance of the government's interests

17

in ensuring that this kind of preventive service

18

coverage is available and, in particular, the

19

contraceptive coverage that's included within it.

20

That's the test.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the question here is

Is it your position that

your view not because of RFRA.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, what ­­ what kind of

20

constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can

21

give an agency the power to grant or not grant a

22

religious exemption based on what the agency determined?

23

I recognize delegation of powers rules are somewhat

24

moribund insofar as their enforcement in this Court.

25

But when we have a First Amendment issue of ­­ of this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

57

consequence, shouldn't we indicate that it's for the

2

Congress, not the agency to determine that this

3

corporation gets the exemption on that one, and not even

4

for RFRA purposes, for other purposes.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And, Your Honor, I do

6

think that it was appropriate for the agency, in

7

exercising its delegated authority here, to take into

8

account the special solicitude that under our

9

constitutional order churches receive.

And it's

10

important to understand, and I want to walk through

11

the ­­ this question of exemptions very carefully

12

because I think there's a lot of confusion here that

13

needs to be cleared up, that all that the ­­ all that

14

the government has done is say that churches, because of

15

that special solicitude, which the Court recognized in

16

Hosanna­Tabor, churches get an exemption.

17

The nonprofit religious organizations don't

18

get an exemption.

19

provided, but that accommodation results in the

20

employees receiving access to this ­­ to the

21

contraceptive coverage, so that doesn't diminish the

22

government's compelling interest.

23

There's an accommodation there

The Tenth Circuit and my friends on the

24

other side have relied on this idea that employers with

25

fewer than 50 employees are somehow exempt.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you gave this

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I ­­ I can't give you a

representation of exactly how low that number is going

13

to go and exactly how long it's going to take.

14

think what you're talking about is a period in which

15

that number is going to go to a very, very low level

16

over a several year period.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I

Well, if you can't

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it true with respect

to the grandfathered plans that the regulations required

immediate compliance with certain requirements, but not

7

with preventive care requirements; isn't that right?

8

Let me read you what HHS said in the regulation:

9

certain particularly significant protections,

"With

10

particularly significant protections, Congress required

11

grandfathered health plans to comply with a subset of

the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions.

the other hand, grandfathered health plans are not

required to comply with certain other requirements of

that preventive health services be covered without any

which there must be immediate compliance?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

would be whether there's a compelling interest in

There's an even longer delay with respect to those kinds

But there is a compelling interest in

6

women's health and in the health of the family, and

7

they're not having a religious objection to taking it.

8

And so the government has said provide it.

9

Then he says, but there is a less

10

restrictive way, and the less restrictive way is the

11

government pays for it.

12

You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go

to the insurance company that would say, insofar as your

the government will pay for it.

answer to that kind of argument.

there are two answers to it.

Assuming it's before the

9

directly, but I do want to make a prefatory point here,

10

which is that under the law, under Ashcroft v. ACLU, for

11

example, the burden on the government is to show that

12

proposed less restrictive alternatives are not equally

13

effective.

14

burden to refute it.

15

If they don't propose it, we don't have a

Having said that, we can refute it.

Now,

16

there are two ­­ and there are two ways.

17

they claim that they don't think that the accommodation

18

is a less restrictive means, I take it, because ­­ or

19

they haven't raised it before today, because they

20

believe that RFRA would require exemptions to that too,

21

such that if you were ­­ if you were to provide the

22

accommodation in which the insurance company comes in

23

and provides the contraception if the employer signs the

24

form, they would say that that ­­ signing the form also

25

makes them complicit in the central activity, and that

Alderson Reporting Company

The first is,

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

65
1

therefore RFRA provides an exemption there, too.

2

And of course the test is whether the

3

proposed alternative advances the government's

4

interests as effectively.

5

subject to exactly the same RFRA objections by exactly

6

the same class of people asking for it, it's not going

7

to serve the government's interest as effectively

8

because the RFRA exemption will result in no coverage

there.

And if it is going to be

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, whether they sign

the piece of paper or not, if they make the RFRA claim

there, which they have with respect to that

5

avoided arguing this as a less restrictive alternative,

6

and I take it it's because their theory, at least, would

lead one to the conclusion you would have to provide a

Mr. Chief Justice.

going to be, but it could be quite considerable.

Now, we don't know how much that cost would

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's not terribly

Well, to the contrary.

22

And two points to make about that.

23

the ­­ one of the methods of contraception they object

24

to here is the IUD.

25

method of contraception that is most effective, but has

First, of course

And that is by far and away the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

67
1

the highest upfront cost and creates precisely the kind

2

of cost barrier that the preventive services provision

3

is trying to break down.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that ­­ I was

5

taken by your answer.

6

position that providing coverage for the full range of

7

contraceptives and other devices and drugs that are

8

covered here is actually financially neutral for an

9

insurance company, that that reduces other costs that

10
11

I thought it was the government's

they would incur.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

It is for the insurance

12

company, but for the woman who is going to not get the

13

benefit of the statute if the exemption is granted ­­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

No.

If she ­­ if she

15

has the coverage through the insurance company but the

16

employer has nothing to do with arranging for that.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, so, in other words,

18

if they haven't raised a RFRA objection to the

19

alternative, but that ­­ but as I said, you know, the

20

logic of their position is that you would get a RFRA

21

objection.

22

It can't be ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Still, I want to get ­­

23

press this a little further, and I don't want you simply

24

to just agree with what I'm about to say.

Don't worry.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

all, somebody, a taxpayer, might say, "I don't want to

fact, that you take from him.

And by the way, that will not only

10

because nobody parks there on Sunday, particularly with

11

12

Now, I'm thinking of ­­ I'm trying to figure

13

out where this case fits in that spectrum because I

14

think the answer to the first two questions is no.

15

I know, so you're just going to agree, and that's what I

16

don't want.

17

And

I want to understand your thinking on that.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

On that point, I think

18

that question plugs into our view of what the

19

substantial burden test requires, that their view of

20

substantial burden is if you have a sincere religious

21

belief and there is any law with a meaningful penalty

22

that imposes on you pressure to do something

23

inconsistent with your belief, then you may pass the

24

substantial burden test.

25

I think the problem with that test as they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

69
1

formulate it, is that under the two hypotheticals that

2

you just gave, Justice Breyer, you've got a substantial

3

burden in those situations, because if you don't pay the

4

tax you can go to jail, for example.

5

And so we think the substantial burden

6

analysis has got to be more strenuous than that.

7

got to incorporate principles of attenuation and

8

proximate cause, and that when you think about this case

9

where the requirement is to purchase insurance which

It's

10

enables actions by others, that you're really closer to

11

the tax situation than to imposing a direct obligation

12

to act.

13
14
15

So that's how we would think about that
issue.

But now, with respect to ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think ­­ I think

8

what Justice Kennedy ­­ I took Justice Kennedy to be

9

asking me, Mr. Chief Justice, was whether the

10

government's choice to provide that accommodation

11

reflected a judgment on the part of the government that

12

this was something less than a compelling interest, and

13

I don't think that inference is possible, because the

14

government was trying to use that accommodation to

15

ensure that the contraceptives were delivered.

16

all due respect, I don't think there is an inconsistency

17

there.

So, with

18

And I ­­ and I do think, if I could, with

19

respect to this issue of whether there are exemptions

20

that defeat a compelling interest, that I submit would

21

be a very dangerous principle for this Court to adopt in

22

the form that my friends on the other side have offered

23

it, because not only would you then be in a position

24

where it would be very hard to see how Title VII

25

enforcement could be justified by compelling interest in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I do think ­­

Title VII was passed

before 1993, so it wouldn't apply ­­ RFRA wouldn't apply

Well, I think ­­ with all

due respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think you could claim a

8

RFRA exemption from Title VII.

9

would be that ­­ and I think one of the things that's

10

significant about the position that my friends on the

11

other side are taking here, is that with respect to

12

exemptions, for example, from the Title VII requirement

13

against discrimination on the basis of religion and

14

hiring, Congress made a quite clear judgment to provide

15

a very narrow exemption:

16

educational institutions and religious associations, and

17

that's it.

Title VII.

And the problem here

21

question is they passed RFRA after that.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But the

But I think the further

23

question, Your Honor, is whether you would interpret

24

RFRA in a manner where you would essentially obliterate

25

that carefully crafted ­­ or what Congress meant to do

Alderson Reporting Company

was to obliterate that carefully crafted exemption and

2

instead say that every for­profit corporation could make

3

a request like that.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if Congress

5

feels as strongly about this as you suggest, they can

6

always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which

7

they have done on other occasions.

8

done it here.

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And they haven't

Well, with all due

10

respect, Your Honor, I think you could make the same

11

argument either way in this case, that the question here

12

is what Congress thought it was doing in 1993, and we

13

don't think, given the long history and the fact that

14

implications of doing it, the implications for

I mean, I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

81

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think our

2

response is what the Court said in Part 3 of the Lee

3

opinion, which is that once you make a choice to go into

4

the commercial sphere, which you certainly do when you

5

incorporate as a for­profit corporation, you are making

6

a choice to live by the rules that govern you and your

7

competitors in the commercial sphere.

8
9

But even if you disagree with me about that,
what I'd like to leave the Court with, is what I think

10

is the most important point here, is that if this

11

exemption were granted, it will be the first time under

12

the Free Exercise Clause or under RFRA in which this

13

Court or any court has held that an employer may take ­­

14

may be granted an exemption that extinguishes

statutorily­guaranteed benefits of fundamental

importance.

with respect to Social Security benefits, that you ­­

19

that it was imperative that the employee's interest be

protected.

position that my friends on the other side raise here,

22

that they leave the third­party employees entirely out

of the equation.
