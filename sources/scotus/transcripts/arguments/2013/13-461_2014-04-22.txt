ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Aereo's business model is to enable

12

thousands of paying strangers to watch live TV online.

13

Aereo's legal argument is that it can make all of that

14

happen without publicly performing.

15

a statute that squarely forecloses that rather

16

counterintuitive submission.

17

Internet and the thousands of mini antennas are new, the

18

basic service that Aereo is providing is not materially

19

different from the service provided by the cable company

20

before this Court in 1969.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, a

18

couple of things.

19

you're ­­ if you're already at that point, you've

20

probably understood that just like a cable company,

21

they're public ­­ they're publicly performing and maybe

22

they qualify as a cable company and maybe they could

23

qualify for the compulsory license that's available

24

to cable companies under Section 111 of the statute.

25

First of all, I mean, I think if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But this gets it

questions if we find that they're a cable company?

say they're a capable company, they get the compulsory

license.

5

Do we have to go to all of those other

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, no.

We

There's lots of

6

conditions on the compulsory license.

7

first place ­­ the reason that we haven't been debating

8

about whether they're a cable company is because they

9

don't want to be a cable company.

And I think the

basic business model would not allow them to qualify

6

with compulsory license anyways.

7

But here's why, if I could ­­ I

But I think the reason they don't

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I'd still like to know

8

the answer to the question, in your opinion.

9

course, if you want a reason, I'll give you my reason.

10

And, of

If we take the public performance, maybe we run

11

into what Professor Nimmer saw as a problem.

12

what used to be called a phonograph record store that

13

sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers giving a public

14

performance?

15

But if it is, there's no ­­ no first sale doctrine and

16

it's a big problem.

17
18
19

Why isn't

It seems to fall within that definition.

So we could avoid that problem.

Now, that's why I'm very interested in the
answer, not just what they want.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think they are

20

ultimately a cable company, and we could debate that

21

question, but it's not the question before you.

22

maybe I could give you some comfort about why you don't

23

need to decide that question.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So

Well, perhaps we should

remand it, because my reason for wanting to decide it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7

what I said.

2

they, in their supporting amici, have thrown up a series

3

of serious problems not involving them, like the cloud,

4

which the government tells us to ignore, and many

5

others, which make me nervous about taking your

6

preferred route.

7

question.

8
9

And what you've read in their briefs is

So that's why I was interested in this

MR. CLEMENT:

But, Justice Breyer, I think

it's very important to ­­ to understand that even if

10

they're a cable company, it doesn't make all these

11

problems go away.

12

that by very virtue of what they want to point to, which

13

is their user specific copies, I don't think they would

14

qualify for the compulsory license.

15

Because they would be a cable company

I also think the better way to avoid your

16

concerns is to maybe take them on directly.

17

that the record company is not involved in a public

18

performance is it's not involved in any performance at

19

all, but that's different, of course, from an online

20

music store, which not only provides a download of

21

something, but actually performs it and streams it and

22

allows it live.

23

not only recognized by the Second Circuit in the ASCAP

24

case, but it's also recognized in the real world by the

25

way these ­­ these different services are structured.

The reason

And that is a basic distinction that's

Alderson Reporting Company

If you provide downloads of music, you get a

2

distribution license or a reproduction license.

3

provide streaming of music where you also have a

4

contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a

5

public performance license.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you

Is your definition ­­ I

7

mean, Justice Breyer has already asked you ­­ said he's

8

troubled about the phonograph store, and ­­ and the

9

Dropbox and the iCloud.

I'm also worried about how to

10

define or ­­ public performance or the performance of a

11

work publicly, which I guess is the better way to do it,

12

according to you.

13

who sells coaxial cable to a resident of a building is

14

not swept up as a participant in this?

15

who ­­ the sort of passive storage advisors that ­­ this

16

is really hard for me.

How do I define that so that someone

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

Or someone

But let me ­­
How do I ­­ what do I do

19

to avoid ­­ what do we do, not me, but what does the

20

Court do to avoid a definition or an acceptance of a

21

definition that might make those people liable?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

Well, let me try to

23

take ­­ those are actually two different examples, and I

24

think the answer to both of them is somewhat different.

25

I think the provider of coaxial cable is ­­ if it's just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

a simple sale of the cable ­­ is not performing at all.

2

And so I think if you're somebody and all you do is take

3

a piece of hardware and you sell it once and for all to

4

a user, then the user may be performing with the

5

equipment, but you're out of the picture.

6

different from an ongoing service, like a cable company

7

or like Aereo, who still owns all these facilities and

8

they're providing, through wire transmissions, these

9

performances on an ongoing basis.

10
11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's

What if you get it

through Dropbox?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's something else

13

before you get to Justice Sotomayor's second half of the

14

question, but something more along the lines of

15

providing hardware.

16

antenna and a hard drive, that's what they sold to the

17

user, and the user was able to use the antenna and the

18

hard drive in her own house or apartment in order to get

19

all these broadcast programs.

20

that be a performance?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Suppose a company just gave the

What would the ­­ would

I think the end user would be

22

doing a performance, but it would be a purely private

23

performance, and I don't think the person that sold them

24

the hardware or really anybody else, if I understand

25

your hypo, would be involved in a performance.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official

10
1

answer to these hypos ­­ I mean, this isn't something

2

that I'm making up on the fly.

3

in the text of the statute.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, it's right there

But then it really does

5

depend on, like, where the ­­ where the hardware is.

6

other words, if ­­ if Aereo has the hardware in its

7

warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to

8

the particular end user, that is going to make all the

9

difference in the world as to whether we have a public

10
11

In

performance or not a public performance.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well ­­ and, again, I think

12

that goes to what I was about to say, which is let's

13

just not because, you know, we like one better than the

14

other.

It's because of the text of the statute Congress

15

wrote.

One of the ways that you can public perform.

16

mean, they start with the classic public performance.

17

Right?

18

But then they say, wait, it's also a public performance

19

if you take the singer's performance and you transmit

20

it, and they're thinking over the airways and all sorts

21

of other ways, if you transmit it to the public.

22

the definition of transmission, then, is to communicate

23

it from one place to another.

24
25

A singer in a concert hall.

I

They’ve sold tickets.

And

So there is a geographical aspect, if you
will, built right into the statute so that if you sell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

somebody hardware and all they're doing is transmitting

2

it to themselves at their home, there's not going to be

3

a transmission that's chargeable to the person who sold

4

you the hardware.

5

from a remote ­­

6

But if you provide an ongoing service

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you think that in my

7

hypo, there's a performance, but it's a private

8

performance and then you move the hardware and it

9

becomes a public performance.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that it?

It ­­ it becomes a public

11

performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would

12

be a private performance on behalf of the receiver.

13

that's one thing that's really important to get in mind,

14

is that in this statute as to the public performance

15

right, there's nothing particularly anomalous about a

16

single transmission that from the sender's perspective

17

is a public performance, but from the recipient's

18

perspective only allows for a private performance.

19

And

If you think about the classic cable

20

context, which is what Congress was trying to address in

21

1976 with the Transmit Clause, you have the cable

22

company and they're taking a performance off of the

23

airways and they're transmitting it to all the

24

end­users.

25

Now, the cable company is clearly performing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

to the public, but that same transmission is allowing

2

each end­user to turn on their television set and to

3

make a performance proper, which is a private

4

performance.

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So Roku is ­­ Roku is

for no reason?

I'm sorry?
Roku is paying a license

They sold me a piece of equipment.

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know all the details

11

of that particular piece of equipment.

12

whether they're ­­ they're paying a license or not.

13

if there was really a transfer and there's nobody else

14

providing a transmission, I don't think that just

15

operating the hardware in the privacy of your own home

16

is going to result in anything but a private

17

performance.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure
But

Go to the iDrop and the

cloud.
MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

Now, there's, I think,

21

it's a slightly different situation.

22

ultimate statutory text that allows you to differentiate

23

a cloud locker storage from something like what Aereo

24

does is a language to the public.

25

in all sorts of places, including the real world,

Alderson Reporting Company

Here, I think the

And I do think that

Official

13
1

there's a fundamental difference between a service that

2

allows ­­ that provides new content to all sorts of

3

end­users, essentially any paying stranger, and a

4

service that provides a locker, a storage service.

5

I think if you want a real world analogy off of the

6

Internet, I think it's the basic decision ­­ the

7

difference between a car dealer and a valet parking

8

service.

9

you might think, hey, both of these things provide cars

And

I mean, if you looked at it from 30,000 feet,

10

to the public.

11

you'd understand, well, if I show up at the car

12

dealership without a car, I'm going to be able to get a

13

car.

14

15

so ­­

But if you looked at it more closely,

If I show up at the valet parking service and I

And

What is the difference ­­

I didn't mean to interrupt

your ­­
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I was just going to ­­

21

so I think there is a very real way in which you would

22

say, you know, at the end of the day, the car dealer's

23

providing cars to the public, the valet parking service

24

is not.

25

It's providing a parking service.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Why isn't ­­ and I

facilities somewhere else from Aereo.

7

they've got an antenna.

8

and let you pick it up when you need it.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, you know, if

You can go to Radio

They'll let you use it when you

Mr. Chief Justice, that's not

11

an implausible way to look at this.

12

way that this Court looked at it in Fortnightly

13

decision.

14

look at it differently, and it said that if you are

15

providing a service, even if you are providing a service

16

that one could reconceptualize as just renting out

17

antennas that somebody could put on their own house, the

18

person that provides that service on an ongoing basis

19

and in the process exploits the copyrighted works of

20

others is engaged in a public performance.

clearly what they were trying to do in the 1976 Act by

22

adding the Transmit Clause.

Here is the ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't find that very

satisfying because I really ­­ I need to know how far

15

the rationale that you want us to accept will go, and I

16

need to understand, I think, what effect it will have on

17

these other technologies.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I had the same question.

19

Just assume that CableVision is our precedent.

20

that it isn't, but let's just assume that it is.

21

would you distinguish the CableVision from your case and

22

how is it applicable here?

23

precedent.

24
25

I know
How

Assume that it's binding

Just that's a hypothetical.

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

But, Justice Kennedy, I

would like to answer both your questions by assuming

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

that the result in CableVision is right, but I don't

2

have to necessarily buy the reasoning, because I think

3

the reasoning of CableVision is profoundly wrong, so let

4

me circle back to that.

5

But the reason there's a fundamental

6

difference between the RS DVR at issue in CableVision

7

and what Aereo provides is, as Justice Alito alluded to,

8

the fact that there's a license in the CableVision

9

context to get the initial performance to the public.

10

And so then I think appropriately the focus in the

11

CableVision context becomes just the playback feature

12

and just the time­shifting that's enabled by that.

13

in that context, if you focus only on that, then the RS

14

DVR looks a lot like a locker service where you have to

15

come in with the content before you can get content out

16

and you only get back the same content.

17

And

And here is what really I think Aereo is

18

like.

19

Second Circuit, decides:

20

Going forward, we're going to dispense with all these

21

licenses, and we are just going to try to tell people we

22

are just an RS DVR, that's all we are, and never mind

23

that we don't have any licensed ability to get the

24

broadcast in the first instance, and we're going to

25

provide it to individual users, and it's all going to be

Aereo is like if CableVision, having won in the
Whew, we won, so guess what?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

because they push buttons and not because we push

2

buttons.

3

how that wouldn't be the clearest violation of the 1976

4

Act.

5

If that were the hypothetical, I don't know

JUSTICE BREYER:

Alright, assume that it isn’t our problem.

6

I'm hearing everybody having the same problem, and I

7

will be absolutely prepared, at least for argument's

8

sake, to assume with you that if there were ever

9

anything that should be held to fall within the public

10

performance, this should be.

11

that.

12

All right?

I will assume

I'm not saying it is.
But then the problem is in the words that do

13

that, because we have to write words, are we somehow

14

catching other things that really will change life and

15

shouldn't, such as the cloud?

16

the government says, don't worry, because that isn't a

17

public performance.

18

I don't see how to get out of it.

19

And you said, well, as

MR. CLEMENT:

And then I read the definition and

Here is the way to get out of

it, Justice Breyer.

Ultimately the words you're going

back at varying times of the day.
MR. CLEMENT:

And if all they can do is, just

3

like the valet car parking service, is get back what

4

they put up there, I think you could easily say that

5

that is not to the public.

6

coming up with a clever distinction.

7

distinction that's really been drawn in the real world,

8

because not all cloud computing is created equal, and

9

there are some cloud computing services that use cloud

10

computing technology to get new content to people that

11

don't have it, and they get licenses.

12

other cloud computing that just has locker services and

13

they don't think they need a license, and so I'm not

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS

18

Thank you, counsel.

AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to begin by reinforcing two of

19

the points that Mr. Clement made.

20

what Aereo is doing is really the functional equivalent

21

of what Congress in the 1976 Act wanted to define as a

22

public performance.

23

potential way of looking at this is that Aereo and

24

companies like it are not providing services, they are

25

simply providing equipment that does, in a more

The first is that

As the Chief Justice said, one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

sophisticated way, what the viewer himself can do.

2

a plausible way of looking at the world.

3

the Court in Fortnightly and Teleprompter said, but

4

Congress acted to override that and to make clear that

5

cable services, services that used one big antenna to

6

pull broadcast signals out of the sky and reroute it to

7

their subscribers, those people were engaged in public

8

performances and they ought to be paying royalties.

9

It's

That's what

The second thing that I would like to

10

reinforce in Mr. Clement's presentation is that there is

11

no reason that a decision in this case should imperil

12

cloud locker services generally, but, as Mr. Clement was

13

pointing out, that the term "cloud computing" ­­

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about Simple.TV or

NimbleTV, which is not quite a hybrid?
MR. STEWART:

I guess I'm not familiar

17

enough with the precise details of the operation, but

18

just let me say in general terms there are obviously

19

services that provide television programming over the

20

Internet.

21

recognize that they are publicly performing.

22

particular company, for instance, recorded television

23

programs and offered to stream them to anyone who paid

24

the fee or offered to stream them for free and made its

25

money off advertising, that would be a public

Some of them are licensed because they

Alderson Reporting Company

If a

Official

21
1

performance because those companies would be providing

2

content to people who didn't have it.

3

I think the basic distinction, the one that

4

at least defines the extremes, is the distinction

5

between the company, whether it be Internet­based or a

6

cable transmitter, that provides content in the first

7

instance and the company that provides consumers with

8

access to content that they already have.

9

cloud locker service, somebody has bought a digital copy

If you have a

10

of a song or a movie from some other source, stores it

11

in a locker and asks that it be streamed back, the cloud

12

locker and storage service is not providing the content.

13

It's providing a mechanism for watching it.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask my same question

15

to you that I asked to Mr. Clement?

16

there's a company that allows sharing and that

17

aggregates all the content that different individual

18

users put up and that in some sense sort of sorts and

19

classifies the content in different ways?

20

that?

21

MR. STEWART:

How about if

How about

I think you would have to ­­

22

you would have to know both the details of the service

23

and you would have to be making a harder call there

24

about how to draw the line, because I don't pretend that

25

there is a bright line between providing a service and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22

providing access to equipment.

2

instance, at the extremes of a person putting a rooftop

3

antenna at his own home, everybody agrees that the

4

rooftop antenna manufacturer is not performing at all

5

and the individual is engaged in a solely private

6

performance.

7

If you look, for

The other extreme is the cable company, one

8

big antenna, makes transmissions to a lot of people;

9

Congress clearly intended to define that as a private

10

performance.

11

lots of hypotheticals that look more or less like one of

12

the other extremes, they are somewhere in the middle.

13

It's an authentically hard call as to where to draw the

14

line.

15

Somewhere in the ­­ you could come up with

MR. STEWART:

We haven't made that argument.

We ­­ we believe that existing U.S. copyright law

reinforce the point that Mr. Clement was making about

15

the phrase "to the public," using his example of the

20

it's distributed to them at that later date, not in

23

distinction along those lines is essential in much more

24

mundane applications of the Copyright Act.

11

for ­­ in a wide range of situations dealing with public

to ask not only are these individuals members of the

The question then becomes, is there a fair
use right to be able to do that.

What Sony said,

10

because Sony was dealing with local over­the­air

11

broadcasts and making a copy of local over­the­air

12

broadcasts, it said that consumers have a fair use right

13

to make a copy of that.

14

Sony did not address the distant signal, and

15

the question then would become in balancing the various fair use

16

factors whether it was appropriate for a consumer to be

17

able to get access to that programming without being

18

able to otherwise implicate the free public spectrum.

19

Now, the way Congress has addressed that,

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio

Shack doesn't pay copyright royalties either.

22

and a company that provides a rental service for me to

23

24

copyright royalties either.

25

And a ­­

And the question that it really boils down

in this case is how significant should it be how long

2

the cord is between the antenna and the DVR being ­­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer is very

4

significant.

5

because what the local antenna person doesn't do but you

6

apparently could do, even if you don't, is with the same

7

kind of device pick up every television signal in the

8

world and send it, almost, and send it into a person's

computer.

And the reason it's very significant is

And that sounds so much like what a CATV

10

system does or what a satellite system does that it

11

looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's

12

imposed upon them.

13

That's what disturbs everyone.

And then what disturbs me on the other side

14

is I don't understand what the decision for you or

15

against you when I write it is going to do to all kinds

16

of other technologies.

That isn't your problem, but it might turn

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

Well, let me address ­­ I

think I ­­ let me try to make it their problem.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

I've read the briefs fairly

I think I've addressed the

distant signal, and I think you can reserve that case to

Alderson Reporting Company

say that might raise a different issue, but on the facts

2

here would not entitle the company to an injunction

3

enjoining Aereo from providing the service.

4

Now, with respect to the second aspect of

5

this, the reason why their interpretation of the

6

Transmit Clause causes so much problem, so many problems

7

for the cloud computing industry, is that ­­ is twofold.

8

Number one, they are conflating performance with work in

9

the Transmit Clause.

What they are saying is that, so

10

long as the work is always perceived in some fashion

11

through a performance that is privately done through the

12

playback of a recording, that that ­­ because the

13

initial work was disseminated to the public, that

14

implicates the public performance right.

15

What that does is it means that every time

16

somebody stores something in the cloud, whether it's a

17

song, a video image or ­­ or the like, if it happens to

18

be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud,

19

the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is

20

going to implicate the public performance right.

21

that's why the cloud computing industry is freaked out

22

about this case because they've invested tens of

23

billions of dollars on the notion that an user­specific,

24

user­initiated copy when perceived by that person is a

25

private performance and not a public performance.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

40
1

The second thing that they do that's wrong

2

with the statute is they aggregate performances.

3

Instead of where the statute says "transmit a

4

performance," they say "transmit performances."

5

they acknowledge that the way the technology works for

6

Aereo is that it is an individual, user­specific,

7

user­initiated copy.

8

enough of them together, you can aggregate that to

9

become a public performance.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because

But they say no matter if you add

Just to make sure

11

I've got ­­ there's no reason it's a user­specific copy,

12

is it?

easier for you if you'd just have to make one copy and

14

everybody could get a copy.

15

They're making 10,000 copies.

MR. FREDERICK:

It'd be much

Well, that's where the issue

16

about replicating what happens in the home matters,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, because if I'm in my home and I start

18

the program two minutes in, using Aereo's technology, I

19

missed the first two minutes, I never get to watch it.

20

It happens to be when I push the button to initiate the

21

copy, just like if I'm at home watching on a DVR, the

22

same principle.

different because I have control over it versus ­­

All I'm trying to

get at, and I'm not saying it's outcome determinative or

22

necessarily bad, I'm just saying your technological

model is based solely on circumventing legal

24

prohibitions that you don't want to comply with, which

25

is fine.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

­­ whether you can

4

give me any technological reason, apart from compliance

5

with a particular legal regime, for your technological

6

mind.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

It is much simpler if you're

8

a start­up to add components, to add modules when you're

9

starting up, ramping up.

And what we're talking about

10

in any cloud computing industry is you're starting with

11

one group of servers and then you add them, almost like

12

Lego pieces, as you are adding the number of people that

13

you're using.

notion that they have in their reply brief over and over

12

that we're somehow a content provider would mean that

13

everybody who provides an antenna or a DVR is somehow a

14

content provider.

15

implications for the equipment industry are obviously

16

quite massive and you can understand why that would

17

frighten the cloud computing industry because that turns

18

them into public performers whenever they are handling

19

content.

20

So the

But the menu,

Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg, is simply what is

14

that are available in a local area, and they are limited

15

because that's what the broadcasters make available.

16

And simply providing a user guide that says you can tune

17

to this channel or you can tune to that channel, if you

18

want to pick up one program or another, can't be the

Now, what you said was, if I understood it,

sufficient to create a line such as the one Mr. Clement

5

supply or provide the content, that puts you in one box;

6

on the other hand, if you are not supplying or providing

7

the content, if the user is supplying and providing the

8

content, and you are just providing the space, a kind of

9

platform for them to do that and for them potentially to

10

share the content, that puts you in another box?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Kagan, I note

12

that my friend did not reference the words of the

Transmit Clause at all when he offered that distinction.

with every copyright holder?

11

telling me they are not a cable company, they are not a

12

satellite company, so they can't go into those systems

of payment.

The ­­ you are, in fact,

What happens then?

MR. CLEMENT:

The consequences really gets

15

back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they

16

actually provide something that is a net benefit

17

technologically, there's no reason people won't license

18

them content.

19

is a gimmick, then they probably will go out of business

20

and nobody should cry a tear over that.

21

But on the other hand, if all they have

JUSTICE BREYER:

Once you take them out of

22

the compulsory licensing system, they're going to have

23

to find copyright owners, who owns James Agee's

24

pictures?

25

like a French silent film in 1915?

Who owns something that was written by ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, the problem

1

is that they might want to have perfectly good things

2

that people want to watch and they can't find out how to

3

get permission.

4

it worries me again once you kick them out of the other

5

systems.

6

That is a problem that worries me and

MR. CLEMENT:

It's not a problem that should

7

worry you because, first of all, if they need a

8

compulsory license, maybe Congress can revisit it as it

9

has in technologically specific ways for cable and

10

satellite, but there is other ways to get content.

11

can approach HBO ­­

But the Second

Circuit ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have some other

rebuttal points?
MR. CLEMENT:

I did, Your Honor, and one of

17

them really gets to this HBO point, which is they want

18

to say that this whole case is about reproduction and

19

there's no public performance going on at all.

20

understand how crazy that is, with all due respect, if

21

they approach HBO and say, we would like to carry your

22

content and provide it as a premium service, they would

23

be telling HBO, by the way, we don't need a public

24

performance license.

25

license because we don't involve ourselves in any public

And to

All we need is a reproduction

performance at all, and that's why at the end of the day

2

their argument simply blinks reality.

3

thousands of paying strangers with public performances

4

over the TV, but they don't publicly perform at all.

5

It's like magic.

Thank you, Your Honors.
