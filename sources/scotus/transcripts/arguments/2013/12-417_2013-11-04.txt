why.

Now, the

And I'll ­­ this is my thought, which suggests

that ­­ that I may not understand this perfectly.

2

It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute,

3

because if, in fact, the unions ­­ those they represent,

4

the workers, don't want ­­ want to be paid for donning

5

and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in

6

the collective bargaining agreement.

7

But ­­ and if they do put something in the

8

collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their

9

bargaining power to get something else, which they must

10

want more.

11

is you prevent the workers from doing that.

of it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. SCHNAPPER:

You said, to paraphrase, all they have

Yes.
That is not what the statute

says, and it's not the way it works.

2

in the agreement or a custom under the agreement.

3

The lower courts, as we've explained in our

The statute says

4

reply brief, have taken the position that what that

5

means is, if there is a collective bargaining agreement

6

and it doesn't expressly require that they be paid for

7

the stuff, then not paying for it is a custom under the

8

contract.

9

And so what actually happens is, in this

negotiation – and it is described in one of these

cases, the gear changes over time.

It's sort of a

The first has to do with the three lawsuits

6

that lead to the Portal­to­Portal Act.

Those are

7

lawsuits between employers and unions.

The CIO, at this

8

point in time, was advancing the rights of workers and

9

interests of workers in two ways:

A, in negotiations;

10

and, B, if they couldn't get something in negotiations,

11

but they thought it was required under the Fair Labor

12

Standards Act, then they would sue, or they would take

13

the position in negotiations that you had to be

14

provided.

15

that describes this history.

16

There is a 1991 Buffalo Law Review article

In one of those cases, the union actually

struck unsuccessfully for this and then proceeded on a

legal track.

That ­­

Justice Ginsburg, is that the statute says, "clothes,"

that just says, "clothes," and make that distinction as

to what the purpose of changing clothing is, whether

it's for sanitary reasons or whether it's for protective

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DiNARDO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Congress enacted 203(o), the

10

Portal­to­Portal Act had already relieved employers of

11

the obligation to pay for changing into or out of

12

ordinary clothing.

13

was directed at the sort of clothing that, absent

14

203(o), could be deemed to be a principal activity, the

15

changing into or out of clothing that was not already

16

excluded by the preliminary and postliminary exclusion

17

in the Portal­to­Portal Act.

18

There is little question that 203(o)

Congress referred in 203(o) to time spent

19

changing clothes ­­ to time spent changing clothes that

20

is excluded from the workday, pursuant to an

21

agreement ­­ a collective bargaining agreement.

22

in the context of an agreement with the labor

23

organization that the time would be excluded.

24
25

It was

Collective bargaining takes place around
activities and determines how certain activities are to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

be treated.

2

whether or not a shirt is clothes or a pair of pants are

3

clothes or protective eye gear, and that is how the

4

statute was written.

5

Collective bargaining does not focus on

Given those two points, the term "clothes"

6

as used in the statute was intended to encompass the

7

work outfit industrial workers were required to change

8

into and out of, to be ready for work.

9

So it can't be

But he says, but you haven't read those words

"custom or practice," and if you see the words "custom

4

or practice," you'll see that an awful lot of businesses

5

or firms or manufacturing across the country actually

6

has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay

7

for that ­­ you know, they didn't exclude it, or they

8

didn't ­­ so in those circumstances, it's the union

9

that's going to have to go to the employer and say,

10

please put some other words in the agreement, so we get

11

this out of the statute.

12

think that's what his point was.

And now, I have no idea ­­ I

13

And, of course, this is an empirical

question in part of that kind of point, which is

15

logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in

talking about quantitatively.

So,the first part of the

question, the notion of custom or practice is a notion

21

of agreement or, at the very least, long­time

22

acquiescence.

in a labor contract that satisfies it on this subject,

24

it seem ­­ it simply needs to object to the nonpayment.

Or is this a

13

verbal agreement, this is acceptable to us, we need not

14

be paid for this beginning­of­the­day block of time.

15

And our suggestion that the test ought to be

16

what these parties agree will be part of the work outfit

17

that will start the day is, in large measure, a

18

recognition of the way collective bargaining operates.

19

A labor union and an employer don't say,

20

should there be pay for putting the hat on or putting

21

the jacket on?

22

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. DiNardo, in this

13

case, does it matter if we take your position that

14

anything you need to wear to be ready for work or the

15

government's position ­­ and I think it was the Seventh

16

Circuit's position, too ­­ that equipment is different

17

from clothes?

18

But, here, the Seventh Circuit said the

19

equipment that's involved, hard hats, glasses, earplugs,

20

respirator, none of those things ­­ that they ­­ they

21

take de minimis time, so we don't have to worry about

22

them.

23

In this case, will it make a difference if

24

we go your way and say, everything worn counts; or the

25

government's way, saying, well, at least clothes

MR. DiNARDO:

So in our particular case,

3

Your Honor, this does not matter.

4

hard hat, the earplugs, the protective eye gear, and the

5

respirator are not at issue in this case.

this notion that there is a dichotomy between clothes

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, when would it matter?

14

Could you give a few examples of when it would make a

15

difference, the ­­ the difference between your test and

16

the government's test?

17

MR. DiNARDO:

Well, it'll make a difference,

18

Your Honor, in ­­ in all of those circumstances, where

19

part of the outfit that you put on to wear to be ready

20

MR. DiNARDO:

Sometimes, it could be for

So some people have to wear certain things, so they're

identified.

5

so they are protected.

6

Other people have to wear things at work,
I think that shouldn't matter.

And the length of time, frankly, shouldn't

MR. DiNARDO:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, Your Honor ­­
That's not the way the term

3

is normally used, is it?

4

MR. DiNARDO:

So I would say this:

In this

5

particular case, the facts of this case, and the

6

record's replete with declarations, the most common

7

event is a worker comes to his locker, takes off some of

8

their clothes, they have to ­­ they're required to put

9

their personal long underwear shirt on and long

10

underwear pants on, then the gear that's in the ­­ the

11

gear ­­ then the clothing that's in the picture.

12

That's ­­ that's the actual events in this case.

13

But if someone were to come in and ­­ in

14

their long underwear and not have to take their outer

15

clothes off and just put the items that are in the

16

record on, then the question becomes have they changed

17

because they have simply layered?

18

I would say this:

It's not the most common

19

use of the term "changing," but it is a ­­ it is a

20

definition of changing, "to make different."

21

would happen here.

22

this particular case.

I think it

So it's actually not the facts of

I think the word is certainly broad enough

24

to encompass ­­ and, lastly, it would make no sense in

25

the statute to allow the personal idiosyncrasies of

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

those people coming to work, someone who decides to

2

layer their items over what they have on, someone else

3

who decides to take them off before they layer.

4

I would say that reading the statute as an

5

activity­based statute is consistent as well with the

6

notion of washing, which is in this statute.

7

think of turning a shower on, necessarily, or retrieving

8

a towel as washing.

15

not covered to the parties closest to deal with it, the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Yang, I will let you

7

speak, but could you answer Justice Scalia's question?

8

Would our ­­ if we were to adopt your colleague's

9

broader definition, would it affect a preliminary and

10
11

post­activity definition?
MR. YANG:

Not at all.

We only get to the

12

question of Section 3(o) when a preliminary activity is

13

deemed to be so integral and indispensable to the

14

primary work that itself is primary work and, therefore,

15

would be compensable.

16

So as, for instance, the Court held in

17

Steiner, there was chemical plant workers who the

18

donning and doffing of their clothing for work purposes

19

was so indispensable to their chemical factory work, it

20

was deemed to be essential.

21

have a collective bargaining agreement that allows the

22

union, on behalf of the employees and the employer, to

23

provide for an alternative method of compensating this

24

type of work.

25

In that context, you might

And, in that context, there are two central

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inquiries that I would like to address today.

2

are the items clothes?

3

some textual meaning here and imposes a limit, which I'd

4

like to discuss a bit further later.

First,

We think "clothes" actually has

5

But, second, if the employee puts on both

6

clothes and some non­clothes items, does the overall

7

process still, nevertheless, constitute the activity of

8

changing clothes?

9

Now, we didn't have to go into great depth

10

into that question in our brief because all the items

11

here are clothes.

12

quite useful to discuss, for a little bit, the activity

13

of changing clothes and then to discuss the specifics.

14

I think it would help the Court out at least in

15

providing a more general rule.

But I think it would be actually

16

The activity of changing clothes is used in

17

the ­­ in the statute to exclude time spent in changing

20

We think that activity also includes

23

So, for instance, if a worker comes into a

24

locker room, spends some time doing the combination on

25

the locker, opens it up, take ­­ opens the locker, that

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not actually changing clothes, per se, but it's part

2

of the activity of changing clothes.

3

So, for instance, if the worker also happens

4

to put on some goggles, pop in an ear plug, maybe even

5

snap on a utility belt in the context of changing

6

clothes, those things are part of "changing clothes," as

7

part of the statute.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

you from Mr. DiNardo?

Now ­­
So, then, what does separate
Now, you're sounding exactly the

same.
MR. YANG:

Well, no, I don't think so

12

because, on the margin, we are largely the same.

13

think, for the mine run of cases, we will be at the same

14

result.

15

I

However, there are some marginal cases where

16

there is a collection of equipment ­­ we would ­­ what

17

we would deem to be equipment, which is put on by an

18

employee that is so significant that it no longer can be

19

fairly treated in conjunction with changing clothes.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. YANG:

Like what?
Well, this is an area ­­ an issue

22

that comes up frequently in the meat packing industry.

23

And I can explain ­­ I need to explain a little bit

24

about the facts to explain why we think that that is a

25

much more difficult question.

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, in the meat packing industry, for

2

instance, particularly meat packers that are rendering

3

large portions of the beef, either with electric saws or

4

very sharp knives or similar instruments, they actually

5

have to put on what the government considers to be ­­ or

6

has considered to be items of equipment.

7

So, for instance, the meat packer might have

8

a chain mail, kind of like armor sleeve, chain mail

9

gloves, another sleeve, chain mail kind of all over the

10

front end, a belly guard ­­ a Plexiglas belly guard.

11

This is something that is very rigid, you can't even sit

12

down on it.

13

And, in fact, you have to sterilize it in a

14

chemical bath before you go into the plant.

15

metal arm guard ­­ or a metal ­­ or, now, Plexiglas

16

MR. YANG:

Because it

What does that mean?
Well, I think it means that when

17

the process is predominantly involving equipment and not

18

clothes, we would think that it's different.

19

I don't think there's really any question that there has

20

to be a line.

And ­­ and

21

For instance, if an employer had an employee

22

go out and, as part of the changing clothes, also go and

23

collect your tools for the day and assemble them in your

It is not

6

Justice Ginsburg, you asked why it matters

7

here and whether the items ­­ how we characterize the

8

items about which the government would disagree with the

9

company, at least in isolation.

And it matters for two

10

reasons that have to do with the broader context of the

11

Fair Labor Standards Act.

12

First, as we explained in our reply brief,

13

there is an unchallenged rule that ­­ that an employer

14

has to pay a worker for carrying tools or other things

15

needed to do the job to the ­­ the work station.

16

If anything in this list isn't clothes and

17

the workers have to have it at the work station, it

18

would presumptively fall within the tool­carrying rule.

19

So it's very important to the company in this case that

20

all of it be clothes.

21

It's also important under the position that

22

the government took in its brief in Tum, which was a

23

companion case to Alvarez, the government's

24

position, with which we agree, is that once there is any

25

non­203(o) exempt item, it starts the calculation of the

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

de minimis time, which then includes, not only the time

2

for that item, but the travel time that follows.

3

It starts the de minimis clock.

If that's

4

right, then if anything in this case isn't 203(o)

5

exempt, the company would have to change this practice.

6

Justice Kagan, you asked more broadly why

7

the test matters.

8

in this direction.

cases involving poultry or ­­ poultry processing in

There is generally few, if any,

10

11

if I had a photograph of it, it looks like clothes test.

12

It's almost all gear.

13

And so in that industry, it's of enormous

14

importance the difference between the government's

15

position in its ­­ at least in its brief and the

16

company's position.

17

those ­­ those plants.

18

That has great implications for

Finally, if I might respond to a point that

19

the government made, the government has introduced

20

another concept, I think, that's not set forth in their

21

brief, but I want to address, and that's that, in

22

addition to the process that would go on, on any of our

23

standards of separating out what things are clothes and

24

what things are not clothes, the government would then

25

overlay that with an ancillary test.

54

1

And if it's predominantly clothes, then the

2

whole thing counts as clothes; if it's predominantly

3

non­clothes, it goes the other way.

4

I don't know.

I think that's another area

5

of uncertainty you shouldn't inflict on the lower

6

courts, and it's not consistent with the statute.

7

statute doesn't say, "changing clothes and ancillary

8

stuff."

9

it's necessary to change your clothes.

10

I'd agree about opening the locker.

The

It's ­­

But when you start taking things which, the

11

government would agree, by themselves aren't clothes,

12

and say, well, this ­­ this falls within changing

13

clothes, even though it's not clothes because it's sort

14

of happening at the same time, seems to me you're

15

opening up another can of worms that should stay closed.

interpretation to which we would normally defer to the
