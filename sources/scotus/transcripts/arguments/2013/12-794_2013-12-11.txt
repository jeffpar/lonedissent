ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. LENZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LENZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly held that a State

11

prisoner cannot obtain habeas relief under AEDPA, unless

12

State court contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly

13

established Federal law.

14

In this case, there was no clearly

15

established Federal law.

16

Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell, this Court has never

17

extended Carter to the selection phase of a capital

18

sentencing trial.

19

established Federal law, the Kentucky Supreme Court was

20

well within its authority to resolve this unresolved

21

question in favor of affirming the sentence.

Under any interpretation of

Because there is no clearly

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

about what you just said?

24

Mitchell; those are the three.

25

Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give

Ms. Lenz, could I ask you
You said Carter, Estelle, and
So Carter says the Fifth

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a no­adverse­inference jury instruction when requested

2

by a defendant.

3

sentencing case.

4

And that was, of course, not a

Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to

5

distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of

6

Respondent's capital murder trial, so far as the

7

protection of the Fifth Amendment, so a kind of general

8

view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the

9

two.

10

And then Mitchell holds ­­ it basically

11

repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the

12

privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of

13

any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial

14

phase.

15

So when you put those together, Carter with

16

Estelle, Mitchell, how ­­ why do you think that there's

17

a gap?

18

MS. LENZ:

Well, there's ­­ there is a gap

19

between Mitchell and Carter.

First of all, Mitchell was

20

not a jury instruction case.

In Mitchell, while the

21

defendant did plead guilty, she did not plead guilty to

22

all of the conduct, so there were still factors that

23

were being contested.

24
25

In this case, Mr. Woodall pled guilty to all
of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Mitchell

Official

1

and Estelle were both concerned with protecting the

2

defendant from the prosecution shifting its burden of

3

proof to the defendant.

4

In this case, there was no ­­ there was no

5

burden shifting because Robert Keith Woodall had already

6

pleaded guilty to the facts, which the prosecutor was

7

required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, to render

8

Mr. Woodall eligible for the death penalty.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think it would

10

have been okay for the trial court to instruct the jury

11

that they could use the defendant's silence against him?

12

Would the affirmative statement have been constitutional

13

and not a violation of the Fifth Amendment?

14

MS. LENZ:

15

proper.

16

refer to ­­

17

I do not think it would have been

Under Kentucky law, the attorney could not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I didn't ask about

18

Kentucky law.

the judge to have said, use silence?

Do you think the Fifth Amendment permits

20

MS. LENZ:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

No.
Use silence to punish

him because he's just a bad person.

23

MS. LENZ:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I ­­ I don't think so.
I mean, that doesn't ­­
Under Federal law, you

don't think the judge could say, ladies and gentlemen of

2

the jury, this defendant has already pleaded guilty to a

3

horrible crime.

4

chosen not to ­­ not to testify in this ­­ in this

5

hearing.

6

This is a punishment hearing.

He has

You ­­ you are ­­ if you wish, you may take

7

his failure to testify as an indication that he does not

8

have remorse, that he is not sorry.

9

before you said and, said I am terribly sorry, I wish I

He could have come

10

had never done it, I will never do it again.

11

chosen not to testify.

12

into account in determining whether ­­ whether there is

13

remorse.

You may, if you wish, take that

You can't say that.

14

MS. LENZ:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

should have been otherwise.

17

He has

Oh, absolutely.

MS. LENZ:

Absolutely.

Well, then, your answer

Well, I guess I interpreted

18

Justice Sotomayor's question a little bit different

19

because she wasn't referring to facts in evidence or ­­

20

or to some type of evidence, but your question asks

21

the ­­ the question about whether silence bears on the

22

determination of a lack of remorse.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MS. LENZ:

25

that open.

Of course.
And Mitchell specifically left

In fact, Mitchell ­­

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there was a

2

factual dispute as to how much the witness ­­ the victim

3

had suffered.

4

How about a statement about that?

MS. LENZ:

Well, I don't think there was

5

actually a dispute about how much the victim suffered.

6

There, I think, you’re referring to the testimony of

7

the blood spatter expert where ­­ wherein he was talking

8

about how the blood was splattered around,and it indicated

9

that there had been quite a struggle when the victim's

10

throat was slashed.

11

And trial counsel ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But take the ­­ take the

13

hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose ­­ you know, the

14

prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our

15

expert that ­­ the blood spattering expert, that the

16

victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look,

17

the defendant didn't take the stand.

18

the stand to deny that?

19
20
21

Why didn't he take

All right?

So could the prosecutor have said that at
the sentencing hearing?
MS. LENZ:

Yes, Justice Kagan.

The

22

prosecutor could have said that because that is a

23

selection factor.

24

victim struggled is not a fact that makes the defendant

25

eligible for the death penalty, so because the ­­ the

That ­­ the fact of whether the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutor had no burden of proof on that, the defendant

2

wasn't in ­­ in jeopardy of having the burden shifted to

3

him.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're suggesting that

5

what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the

6

remorse question of ­­ that we ­­ that we talked about

7

in ­­ not Mitchell, but ­­ is it Mitchell?

8

MS. LENZ:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mitchell, yes.
It goes beyond the remorse

10

question.

11

sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to

12

do with ­­ with anything that happens there essentially,

13

because once ­­ once the person has been found eligible

14

for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can ­­

15

can draw whatever inferences they want.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I

What do we do about ­­ I

20

mean, I think the relevant pages are ­­ it's at 526 U.S.

21

328 to 330, probably read those 17 times.

22

When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle.

23

As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies

24

with full force.

25

no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty

All right.

Estelle says, "The court could discern

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the

2

protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is

3

concerned."

4

I marked five separate statements in those

5

two pages that came to the same thing.

6

Estelle.

7

note the comment that he wanted in respect to a

8

sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide;

9

namely, future dangerousness.

10

I looked at

Estelle has to do with the right to note ­­

Nothing to do with a fact

about the crime, a sentencing fact.

11

So then I said, well, what favors you here?

12

What favors you is the last sentence of the first

13

paragraph on 330, which says, "Whether silence bears

14

upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon

15

acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the

16

downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing

17

Guidelines is a separate question.

18

and we express no view on it."

19

Right.

It is not before us

It's, one, not just a sentencing

20

fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of

21

remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three,

22

it is a decision for a judge, not the jury.

23

confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules

24

Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing.

25

sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.

7

prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to make

8

Mr. Smith eligible for the death penalty.

9

That's a very

10

about, which would be a selection factor and the

11

prosecution has ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I thought the

that show that he had a bad childhood, and he didn't

16

context, he asked for the no silence/silence

17

instruction.

18

then refused to give the instruction.

19

And in that

The government did not object.

All right.

The judge

Now, what's the difference

20

between the facts about how his parents raised him and

21

the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle?

22

MS. LENZ:

The difference is the burden of

23

proof.

24

circumstance.

25

mitigating circumstances.

How his parents raised him is a mitigating
Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof on
The jury was instructed they

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had to consider the mitigating circumstances.

2

whether Mr. Woodall testified or not, we assume that the

3

jury followed the instructions and considered the

4

mitigating circumstances.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the

6

instruction that was requested but not given was as

7

follows, quote, "A defendant is not compelled to testify

8

and the fact that the defendant did not testify should

9

not prejudice him in any way."

10

That was the

instruction?

11

MS. LENZ:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, sir.
So suppose that the ­­ you

13

put on evidence of ­­ to show that he was qualified for

14

the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating

15

factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation

16

evidence.

17

the fact that the defendant did not testify should not

18

prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to

19

put on any mitigation evidence at all; is that correct?

The instruction would say, would it not, that

20

MS. LENZ:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

21

That's exactly right.

So, in essence, it really shifts

22

the burden of proof ­­ Mr. Woodall's burden of proof

23

back to the prosecution.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In this case, of course,

the question is even narrower.

That instruction would

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

forbid the jury from even taking into account his

2

failure to testify on ­­ on the one factor of remorse ­­

3

the one psychological factor of remorse.

4

And if you say that you're not entitled to

5

such an instruction on that, that alone would have ­­

6

would have been enough to deny the requested

7

instruction.

8
9
10
11

MS. LENZ:
exactly right.

That's exactly right.

That's

And I think the judge indicates ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you call him, to

ask him if he feels sorry?

12

If he has no Fifth Amendment right, could

13

you call him to the stand and ask him, are you sorry?

14

MS. LENZ:

No, Justice Sotomayor, because

15

there are two rulings in Mitchell, and the first ruling

16

in Mitchell says that ­­ said that Mitchell still had

17

the Fifth Amendment right in the sentencing proceeding

18

after the guilty plea.

19

Mitchell.

20

That's the first ruling in

But the second ruling in Mitchell then

21

limits that.

22

adverse inferences whatsoever that cannot be inferred.

23

says no adverse inferences can be inferred on facts and

24

circumstances that the prosecutor is required to prove

25

which increase the penalty range.

It doesn't say there are no adverses ­­ no

12
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

So there's a difference.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So ­­
Is your position,

3

basically, that this is in the nature of a ­­ an

4

affirmative defense and that defendant carries the

5

burden on remorse ­­ and what was the other one that

6

Mitchell saved out?

Acceptance of responsibility?

7

MS. LENZ:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
So if defendant says

nothing, then he hasn't ­­ he hasn't proved a mitigator.
MS. LENZ:

That's right, and ­­ and he bears

11

the burden of proof on that, and he bears the

12

consequences from failing to meet his burden on that.

13

The prosecution has absolutely no burden with regard to

14

mitigating circumstances.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So would it have been an

16

acceptable and workable rule to say that, in a

17

sentencing hearing, on any point where the defendant has

18

the burden of proof the government is entitled to

19

testimony, that silence can be the basis for an adverse

20

inference?

21

MS. LENZ:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you repeat the question?
Would it be an acceptable,

23

workable rule to say that in a sentencing hearing, on

24

any issue where the defendant has the burden of proof

25

the prosecution is entitled to an instruction that

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

silence can be the basis for an inference against the

2

defendant on those issues?

3

(Pause.)

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

say yes or no.

6

remorse is different?

7

included within that.

8

MS. LENZ:

9
10
11
12
13

I mean, you have to either

If ­­ if you say no, then I ask why
If you say yes, then remorse is

Well, I think no, and remorse is

different because, again, that's a mitigating
circumstance upon which Woodall has the burden of proof.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What did you

just say?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't understand why

14

you're not entitled to the instruction on all issues as

15

to which the defendant has the burden of proof ­­

16

MS. LENZ:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18
19

Well, it makes sense ­­
­­ in a sentencing

hearing.
MS. LENZ:

It makes sense to not ­­ the

20

purpose of the no­adverse­inference instruction is to

21

protect the defendant from the prosecution shifting its

22

burden of proof, in other words, using his silence to

23

prove one of the elements that the prosecution is

24

required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The ­­ the assumption in

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

my question is that the defendant has the burden of

2

proof on a certain number of issues in the sentencing

3

hearing.

4

has to be your position that the government is entitled

5

to the instruction that I described.

As to all of those issues, it seems to me it

6

Or you're just going to stand up and say,

7

well, remorse is different, but I ­­ we need to know

8

what ­­ what your argument is.

9
10
11

MS. LENZ:

You need to know why remorse is

different, is that what you're asking?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

asking it, yes.

13

MS. LENZ:

Well, that's one way of

Yes.

Well, I think it would be

the same answer.

circumstance, and the prosecution has no burden of proof

on mitigating circumstances.

choice as to whether he wants to place evidence in the

18

record regarding any mitigating circumstances

19

whatsoever.

20

It's just that remorse is a mitigating

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the defendant's

Well, when a party has the

21

burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the

22

customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury

23

that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence

24

to show this, rather than to ­­ to talk about inferences

25

that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

failure to produce evidence.
MS. LENZ:

Well, in this case, the jury was

3

not instructed that Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof

4

on the mitigating circumstances.

5

to consider the mitigating circumstances.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They were instructed

They also weren't

instructed to draw any inferences, were they?

8

MS. LENZ:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, they were not.
I mean, the ­­ the issue

10

here is whether you must instruct them not to draw

11

inferences, not ­­ not whether ­­ whether ­­ anyway.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the jury was

13

instructed, "You shall consider such mitigating or

14

extenuating facts and circumstances as have been

15

presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be

16

true."

17

Now, I suppose they could have been ­­ the

18

mitigating evidence could have been put in by the

19

prosecution, but for the most part, they're going to be

20

put in by the defense.

21

consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented

22

to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the

23

defendant has the burden of producing evidence of

24

mitigation, if the defendant wants to do that?

25

MS. LENZ:

So when the judge says you can

I don't think it speaks to who

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has the burden.

2

required to consider ­­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It just speaks to the fact that they're

I thought we ­­ it wasn't

4

controversial that, on mitigating factors, the defendant

5

does have the burden.

6

MS. LENZ:

7
8
9

He does.

He does.

That's

correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So is ­­ is there a

difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want

10

you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's

11

silence against him, or a judge, on his own, telling the

12

jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say

13

you can't take it into account?

14

MS. LENZ:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16
17

Well, I do think ­­
Are all those the same,

or would you distinguish them?
MS. LENZ: I do, I think there ­­ there is a

18

difference between the prosecution and the court not

19

telling the jury that, that they can take the

20

defendant's silence into consideration, I do.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, where does that

22

difference come from?

23

time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an

24

adverse inference, we've also required a requested jury

25

instruction.

Because I thought that, every

I don't know of a ­­ of a case or any

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principle that would suggest that we can tear those two

2

things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference

3

is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction.

4

MS. LENZ:

Well, the ­­ the only situation

5

that I'm aware of that the Court has ­­ that it has

6

extended Griffin with this Carter instruction is in the

7

guilt phase, where the prosecution is still required

8

to prove guilt.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm asking a

10

different question.

11

that those two things don't go hand and hand?

12

my ­­ my sort of reading of our case law is that they

13

do.

14

prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled ­­

15

is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences

16

if he requests it.

17

Do you have any case that suggests
Because

Any time we've said an adverse inference is

MS. LENZ:

Well, you said that, in every

18

case, but one, I suppose, except for Mitchell, and

19

that's the most important case here.

20

Mitchell said that the jury couldn't infer anything

21

negative from the facts and circumstances of the crime

22

upon which the prosecutor ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

instruction.

4

from anything.

5

You looked at

It says no adverse inference may be drawn
All right.

So there seemed to be some objection you had

6

to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the

7

instruction.

8

Justice Alito said and you have said.

9

the instruction is ­­ "The defendant is not compelled to

10

testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as

11

inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any

12

way," with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications.

13

All right?

14

is the correct reading of the case and that adverse

inferences apply to everything, but factors such as lack

7

of remorse or downward adjustment in the sentencing

8

guidelines, that leaves a huge hole in Mitchell.

9

You could drive a truck through that hole

10

because, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in

11

Mitchell, the bulk of what sentencing is about are these

other factors, the other factors, what kind of childhood

he had, mitigation and all of that sort of thing.

government to establish that the aggravating

In this case, Instruction 6, which is found at

Okay?

That's Instruction Number 4.

that you requested, a defendant is not compelled to

that the failure ­­ the fact that the defendant didn't

any way.

On the other hand, the judge told me

So what am I supposed to do?

MR. KOMP:

Well, in that case, again, if ­­

if there's no mitigating evidence presented, you don't

17

But taking your hypothetical, and you're in that jury

And what this Carter instruction would

prohibit is ­­ is preventing his failure to testify, his

failure to offer a lack of remorse, to say, I'm sorry,

17

Remorse was not a mitigation theory that was presented

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:

A low IQ and a personality

disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors?

5

MR. KOMP:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
So in a case where there

7

are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors,

8

he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder,

9

he says nothing.

The jurors go in the room.

They have

10

to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder

11

and what weight should we give that as mitigators?

12

This instruction says, jurors, do it.

Just,

13

when you do it, don't take account of the fact that he,

14

himself, did not testify.

15

MR. KOMP:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Is that ­­ that ­­ so that

17

jurors are perfectly clear, I would think.

18

is difficult for you is just what your friend raised.

It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt.

You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut

21

out "guilt" because this has nothing to do with guilt,

22

right.

23

What I think

Estelle says, I would think, that you have a

24

right to a Carter instruction in respect to some

25

sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

The

factors, namely,

So the question for you is why does that

6

thing ­­ that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why

7

isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is

8

entitled to that instruction here?

9
10

And your response to that is what?
MR. KOMP:

My ­­ my response to that is ­­

11

is twofold.

through in the opening presentation, Mitchell was not

15

cases as the ­­ as the clearly existing authority.

One, as ­­ in ­­ as this Court was walking

It relied on Estelle and the Griffin line of

16

When you get to that ­­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Estelle might not have

18

been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts

19

in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse

20

might be different.

21

And the question is why doesn't that caveat

22

suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that

23

you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this

24

Court has decided because the instruction that you asked

25

for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were going to come before the jury at the sentencing

2

phase.

3

So at the very least, it seems that

4

instruction sort of blows by the question that we have

5

reserved.

6

MR. KOMP:

Two points, and one is, when this

7

instruction was requested, Mitchell had not been

8

decided.

9

Mitchell came out prior to the Kentucky Supreme Court's

So the slate was Griffin, Carter, Estelle, and

10

ruling.

11

without the reservation that exists.

12

So this instruction was based on ­­ you know,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but then the

13

reservation certainly suggests that, at the time the

14

instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any

15

fair­minded dispute, which is the standard.

16

talked about the standard yet.

17

which you're complaining about ­­ that the error has to

18

be so well understood and comprehended in existing law

19

to be beyond any possibility of fair­minded

20

disagreement.

21

No one's

The standard is that ­­

And it seems to me if, shortly after the

22

instruction was requested, the court itself said, oh,

23

that's different, we're not talking about that, it

24

certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair­minded

25

disagreement.

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. KOMP:

I think you have ­­ we have to

2

examine what Mitchell ­­ Mitchell, again, was framed as

3

a Federal sentencing guidelines case, and that passage I

4

read earlier from Mitchell, the next sentence is, "And

5

although Estelle was a capital case, its reasoning

6

applies with full force here, where the government seeks

7

to use Petitioner's silence to infer commission of

8

disputed acts."

9

And what ­­ what this Court was doing was

10

extending Estelle into the Federal sentencing guidelines

11

case, and it wasn't at the same time cutting back on

12

Estelle the Fifth ­­ the recognition that the Fifth

13

Amendment applies at the capital sentencing.

14

Our read of that exception ­­ the language,

15

is that whether silence bears upon the determination of

16

lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for

17

purposes of the downward adjustment provided in the

18

sentencing guidelines is a separate question.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not only that.

Your

20

position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond

21

fair­minded disagreement.

22
23

MR. KOMP:

It's clear that that relates to

fair ­­ to Federal sentencing guidelines cases.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. KOMP:

Right.

Or possibly noncapital cases,

because this Court didn't simultaneously accept Estelle

2

as the clearly existing law and then cut it.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you're

4

saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable

5

disagreement, to say that, when the court says lack of

6

remorse in a sentencing guideline case, it still thinks

7

there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a

8

selection case such as this.

9

MR. KOMP:

But I think the answer is found

10

within Estelle because Estelle was based on the future

11

dangerousness, and the psychiatrist that ­­ or, pardon

12

me, psychologist that testified in Estelle, his finding

13

of future dangerousness, which is a selection question

14

which has nothing to do with eligibility, his finding of

15

future dangerousness was based on lack of remorse.

Estelle isn't just a compulsion case.

There’s

a

I thought your

MR. KOMP:

Under this Court's ­­ the then

I believe that Estelle settled

this, and Mitchell did not cut back on Estelle in the

no­adverse instruction that's required by Carter.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is, but you have to go

beyond saying I believe that.

prevail here is, not only do I believe it, but no

believe otherwise.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No reasonable jurors could

say otherwise?
MR. KOMP:

One, I don't think this Court in

23

Williams said that ­­ that ­­ or not ­­ that AEDPA is

24

not a subjective juror/judge contest.

25

Mitchell and it talks about this is a product of our

42
Alderson Reporting Company

And if you read

1

existing precedent, this is a rule of proven utility,

2

this is an essential feature of our justice system,

the ­­ the rule was ­­ was absolutely clear that ­­ that

4

these no ­­ no­adverse­inferences could be raised.

5

that was a ­­ a rule of proven utility.

6

And

And all that Mitchell did in that one

7

sentence is reserve a question that ­­ that may or may

8

not be applicable in Federal sentencing or noncapital

9

sentencing.

It did not cut back on Estelle, which said

10

for ­­ that there is no basis to distinguish between the

11

guilt and penalty phases of capital cases.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so your

argument is when Mitchell said ­­ whether it applies to

lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the

of Skipper evidence.

So when you're asking for a life without

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MS. LENZ:

17

I would just like to point out, at the

Thank you.

18

beginning of his responsive argument, my colleague was

19

talking about the selection factors in Estelle.

20

whether they're called selection factors or whatever

21

they're called, the prosecutor had to prove future

22

dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt in order to

23

render the defendant in that case death eligible.

24
25

And

There were three things that the prosecution
had to prove, and that was one of them.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

So those

Official

1

selection factors, or whatever you want to call them,

2

operated as aggravating circumstances for the death

3

penalty, so I just wanted to make sure that the Court is

4

clear on that.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Jurek reads to the contrary.

7

MS. LENZ:

8

contrary, no.

factors.

13

nomenclature, they operated as aggravating

14

circumstances, the prosecution has burden of proof.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the only criteria to

determine harmlessness is the gruesome ­­ gruesome

17

nature of the crime, it appears to me that, in almost

19

is inherent.

20

which a defendant can prove a harmful sentencing error.

to make is that there was not clearly established law in
