ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Federal Circuit applied a de novo

12

without­deference standard to objective baselessness in

13

Section 285 cases.

14

That was wrong for three reasons.

First, this Court has already held that a

15

unitary abuse­of­discretion standard should be applied

16

in closely analogous cases in the Pierce and Cooter

17

cases.

18

appeals over attorneys' fees concerning the supervision

19

of litigation, which is precisely what Section 285

20

addresses.

21

Those cases, like this one, were ancillary

Second, the text of the Act, and in

22

particular its key words, "may" and "exceptional

23

cases," imbued district courts with discretion.

24

up until this case, that was the way the Act applied for

25

60 years.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Indeed,

Official

1

And, third, the other factors this Court has

2

looked to, such as a lack of law clarifying benefits,

3

the positioning of the decision­maker, efficiency in

4

avoiding distortion, cut in favor of unitary

5

abuse­of­discretion review.

6

For those reasons, the case for such review

7

even stronger here than it was in Pierce and Cooter.

8

Pierce and Cooter, this Court looked to ­­ for ­­ in

9

Pierce, for example, this Court looked to EAJA and

In

10

determined that, even though the text of the statute

11

didn't compel a result, nonetheless, unitary

12

abuse of discretion review was the appropriate standard.

13

And here ­­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How ­­ how does

15

abuse of discretion work with respect to a pure legal

16

question?

17

MR. KATYAL:

I think this Court answered

18

that both in Pierce and Cooter.

19

pure legal question, then it is a ­­ that it is a ­­

20

21

circumstance.

objective baselessness.

3

facts.

4

It always depends on the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, would you explain that

5

to me a little bit, Mr. Katyal.

6

district court just uses an erroneous claim

7

construction, you would concede that that's a pure legal

8

question, so that would be an abuse of discretion?

9

MR. KATYAL:

In a case in which the

We would not, Your Honor.

So

10

certainly on the merits, if the question of claim

11

construction went up to the Federal Circuit ­­ as it did

12

here, for example, in 2009 ­­ the question there would

13

be there would be no deference under the Federal

14

Circuit's precedent in a ­­ most recently, Friday in the

15

Lighting Ballast case.

16

But when the question is a 285 question, the

17

retrospective look at objective baselessness of which

18

claim construction forms a part ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but I ­­ I guess my

20

first question was just if what ­­ if the district court

21

says, Here's the appropriate claim construction, and

22

in saying that, it's wrong.

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.
Is that a legal question?
As it goes up to the Federal

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit under existing precedent, they treat that as a

2

legal question.

3

Markman suggests otherwise.

4

question, a mongrel question of law and fact.

5

when ­­ if the Court were ever to get into that ultimate

6

question on the merits, we think that ­­ that the

7

Markman analysis would control.

We think this Court's decision in
It said it was a mixed
And so

8

But here the question is a 285 question.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So let's just assume

10

for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would

11

be a mistake of law.

12

understand you say that there's a question.

Let's just assume that.

And I

13

But if that's right, why is it not also true

14

that a judge's statement that a litigant ­­ that a

15

litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a

16

similar mistake of law?

17

MR. KATYAL:

For ­­ for exactly the reason

18

that I think Pierce says, which is the question in a

19

retrospective attorneys' fees case is not what the ­­ is

20

not what was the law; it's rather, was the position that

21

the party took reasonable.

22

And so, for example, in Pierce the question

23

was under a certain statute, EAJA, do the words "shall"

24

and "authorized" ­­ do they mean mandatory?

25

White in dissent said that's a pure legal question.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And Justice

Official

1

That's something courts of appeals deal with all the

2

time, district courts don't deal with it; we should give

3

no deference to that.

4

the Court said, No, even there, that is something we're

5

looking at that legal claim as situated within the

6

particular contours of the case overall in deciding was

7

that a reasonable argument or not.

8
9

And Justice Scalia's opinion for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But isn't the main thing the

judge doing when it says that a claim construction is

10

unreasonable is essentially measuring the delta between

11

the actual ­­ the correct claim construction and the

12

mistaken claim construction?

13

be, again, assuming that the claim construction itself

14

is a question of law?

15

question of law?

16

MR. KATYAL:

And doesn't that seem to

Doesn't that itself seem to be a

We agree that's one of the

17

things the judge is doing there, but it's not the only

18

thing.

19

interpreting the meaning of the statute, but they were

20

doing it within the context of litigation.

21

think is a helpful example and ­­ to remove it from the

22

abstract and just bring it down to here.

23

Just as in Pierce, certainly the Court was

This case I

You've heard and you've read the brief on

24

the other side saying this is a claim construction

25

dispute.

It's not a claim construction dispute.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official

1

the district court found seven different times when it

2

imposed fees is that this is actually a dispute about

3

infringement and their inability to come up with any

4

theory whatsoever for why ­­ why there was a

5

infringement violation.

6

And what I think the logic of Pierce and

7

Cooter is, is that if you give clever appellate lawyers

8

like my friend the ability to go to the ­­ to go to a

9

court of appeals and repackage what were essentially

10

factual claims and claim they're legal ­­ here, claim

11

construction ­­ then you're going to ­­ you're going to

12

waste an enormous time of ­­ time and resources of the

13

Federal Circuit as they seek to disaggregate, is this

14

really, truly factual or is this really legal.

15

And you wouldn't want to have that, I think,

16

for the reasons that this Court has said repeatedly,

17

which is the whole goal in attorney fees cases is to

18

avoid a second major litigation.

19

what the Federal Circuit did here.

20

new theory under this de novo without­deference

21

standard.

22

think all of the attorney fees cases are trying to

23

address.

24
25

And that's the harm.

And that's precisely
It minted a whole

That's the evil that I

I'd also say that, you know, even if ­­
beyond Pierce, beyond Pierce, we do think this is

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

essentially Pierce­plus; that this is a case in which

2

the text of the statute and its key words, "may in

3

exceptional cases," give the Court, I think, further

4

reason to return the standard to the way it has always

5

been interpreted for 60 years.

6

And for 60 years:

From 1946 to 1952,

7

Abuse of discretion deferential review was used in

8

objective baselessness cases; in 1952, the ­­ the

9

Congress codified, essentially, those ­­ that

10

interpretation; from 1952 to 1982, the regional circuits

11

used it, like the D.C. Circuit in the Oetiker case;

12

after 1982, the Federal Circuit used it time and again

13

in cases such as Eon­Net.

14

It's this case that really is a dramatic

15

departure from the way Section 285 has been interpreted,

16

and indeed the way all attorney fee litigation has been

17

interpreted.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we undo ­­

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On your reading,

20

Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies

21

fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that

22

overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse

23

of ­­ abuse of discretion.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

We think that it is hard in

that circumstance, and that's the one­way ratchet.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

1

don't place a lot of emphasis on that in our brief.

2

It's our last argument.

3

it is hard to overturn a district court's decision not

4

to award fees, whereas under the Federal Circuit's

5

interpretation, it's really quite easy for the Federal

6

Circuit to mint some new theory as to why the position

7

was reasonable that ­­ that the attorney took.

But we do think, essentially,

8

And, Justice Breyer, you said in the last

9

argument, you said clever patent attorneys can always

10

come up with a colorable argument, and you were

11

referring at the district court stage ­­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you leave it to the

13

district court that way and the district court denies

14

fees, isn't there a ­­ a risk of large disparities from

15

district judge to district judge.

16

think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so

17

I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will

18

say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award

19

fees.

20

MR. KATYAL:

One will say, yes, I

We do think implicit in an

21

abuse of discretion standard or Congress committing this

22

to district court discretion will be some variation.

23

think this Court answered that problem in Koon, I think

24

most particularly, in a case where the stakes were ­­

25

you know, not to belittle this case ­­ but the stakes

10
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

1
2

were even higher there, criminal sentencing.
And what the Court said is, yes, there will

3

be some disuniformity, but district court judges are

4

better able to determine the mine­run case than will the

5

court of appeals because they're able to assess the

6

entirety of the litigation, rather than ­­ than one

7

piece of it.

18

petitioner's theory in Octane, the case here only gets

19

stronger.

20

You have to, I think, ultimately reverse

what the Federal Circuit said at page 9a of the petition

So when does that become

collateral question about how reasonable was this

It's a retrospective

And what Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce

says is that's not the type of question that we should

be spending a lot of court of appeals' resources on.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

7

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8
9
10
11

Thank you, counsel.

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. FLETCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this morning's first case, you will

12

decide what principles should guide a district court's

13

award of attorneys' fees under Section 285.

14

standard you choose to adopt in that case, we believe

15

that a district court's application to the particular

16

facts of a case before it ought to be reviewed under a

17

unitary abuse of discretion standard.

18

Whatever

That approach is consistent with this

19

Court's repeated statements that decisions about the

20

supervision of litigation ought to be reviewed under a

21

deferential standard.

22

it's also supported by the text and history of

23

Section 285, by 60 years of consistent appellate

24

practice, and by the same sorts of practical

25

considerations that led this Court to adopt a similar

And in this particular context,

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approach to very similar questions in Pierce and in

2

Cooter & Gell.

3

I'd like to start, if I could, by focusing

4

on a point that hasn't come up so far in the argument,

5

which is we've heard a lot about why district courts are

6

best situated to make the determination in a particular

7

case that they've lived with, often for years at a time,

8

of whether or not a particular litigating position is

9

unreasonable.

10
11

And we think that's true and a very good

reason to accord deference here.
But we think another good reason to accord

12

deference in this context is that applying de novo

13

review requires a substantial expenditure of appellate

14

resources.

15

I think this case is a good example.

The Federal Circuit affirmed the district

16

court's decision on the merits in an unpublished

17

decision and, in fact, without written opinion.

18

when it reviewed the district court's award of fees

19

under a de novo standard, it was required to engage in a

20

lengthy analysis that produced a lengthy written

21

opinion.

22

requiring appellate courts, and the Federal Circuit in

23

particular, to engage in that kind of review encourages

24

collateral appeals and encourages the expenditure of

25

resources on decisions that don't actually produce the

But

And we think applying a de novo standard and

law ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

can make that argument with respect to every legal issue

4

that's raised on appeal.

5

whether the lower court was right, that's a lot of work.

6

But if all you have to decide is whether the lower court

7

abused its discretion in deciding if the law means what

8

the lower court said it means, that's a lot less work.

9
10

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, if you have to decide

Well, that ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that argument is a

11

strange argument, unless there's something really

12

special about the attorneys' fees context.

13

that's your argument, there's something really special.

14

But why should it?

And I guess

I mean, you've got a lot

15

of money involved.

16

collateral litigation, even though it involves millions

17

of dollars more than the claim in many other types of

18

cases?

19

Why should we say, this is

MR. FLETCHER:

So let me say a couple of

20

things about that, and one is, I think ordinarily when

21

an appellate court applies a de novo standard and

22

determines what the right answer is, that has benefits

23

not just for the particular litigants before it, but

24

also in clarifying the law for everyone going forward.

25

But what the Court said in Pierce and in

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Cooter & Gell and what's also true here is that when the

2

question that the appellate court is answering is not

3

what is the law actually, but rather what could a party,

4

when it initiated this case and continued to litigate it

5

several years ago, could that party have a ­­ reasonably

6

believed the law to be, that doesn't yield the same sort

7

of law­clarifying benefit.

8

Court said those sorts of determinations are never going

9

to be made clear under any sort of review standard.

10

In fact, in Pierce, this

JUSTICE ALITO:

It can clarify what the

11

law is.

12

and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity

13

in a civil rights case or applying the ­­ applying AEDPA

14

in a habeas case?

15

law is, and then after that, as the second step,

16

determine whether a particular interpretation of the law

17

was reasonable.

18

What's the difference between that situation

The court can say this is what the

You could do the same thing here.

MR. FLETCHER:

A court could do that here,

19

and I suppose the Federal Circuit, if the case came to

20

it on the ­­ the question was the District Court ­­ did

21

it abuse its discretion or did it get it right in

22

deciding that the party's position was unreasonable, the

23

could ­­ the court ­­ Federal Circuit could decide the

24

underlying question itself and then decide whether or

25

not the district court was correct in concluding that a

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

party's position was reasonable or unreasonable.
But we think there's ­­ there's good reason

3

not to do that here, and we think that, in these

4

contexts, unlike in qualified immunity, unlike in AEDPA,

5

the district court has particular expertise in the case

6

and a long experience with the case, and ­­ and that

7

requiring the Federal Circuit to engage in a thorough

8

review of the entire record of the litigation and the

9

entire proceedings of the litigation imposes a burden

10

that just isn't justified.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm just wondering, if

12

you put together your two arguments about what the

13

standard should be and what the standard of review

14

should be, whether there really is going to be any

15

meaningful review of what district courts do in this

16

situation.

17

Maybe you could just describe for me what an

18

appellate decision would look like, saying that applying

19

the totality of the circumstances, the district court

20

abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees.

21

What would an appellate court say.

22

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think one thing that an

23

appellate court might say, as Justice Kagan alluded to

24

earlier, is that if the district court has based its fee

25

award on a misunderstanding of the law, if it got the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

claim construction wrong, if it misinterpreted the

2

relevant patent statutes, that would obviously be an

3

abuse of discretion.

4

But I think even if the district court

5

correctly conceived of the law, abuse of discretion

6

review still leaves room for an appellate court to say

7

that, although the district court had a wide range of

8

options and has flexibility, this particular decision on

9

these particular facts strays too far from that range.

10

I think courts of appeals do that in the sentencing

11

context, they do that in other contexts where they

12

review district court decisions for abuse of discretion,

13

and we think that performing that role, which

14

abuse of discretion review comfortably accommodates,

15

leaves plenty of room for the Federal Circuit to rein in

16

any outlier district court decisions.

17

I think another point that's useful to keep

18

in mind is the extent to which applying a de novo

19

standard of review encourages collateral appeals.

20

think a theme of this Court's decisions about attorneys'

21

fees has been that a dispute over fees should not give

22

rise to a second major litigation, and I think applying

23

a de novo standard encourages that, both in encouraging

24

parties to take marginal appeals and also in leading to

25

fights about which parts of the district court's

18
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

decision are factual, which parts are legal, which

2

standard of review applies to different parts of a

3

district court's decision.

4

I think all of those things are ­­ add to

5

the burden of the collateral fee litigation in a way

6

that does ­­ isn't justified by the benefit that de novo

7

review provides.

8

The last point that I think I'd like to

9

leave you with is the notion that I think there ­­

10

Justice Alito, earlier you suggested that the Federal

11

Circuit has expertise in patent law and special

12

expertise in patent law.

13

strongest argument that the other side has.

And I frankly think that's the

14

But I'd urge you to look at Judge Moore's

15

dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this

16

case, where she and four of her colleagues on the

17

Federal Circuit explained that when you're asking

18

whether or not a party's litigating position was

19

objectively reasonable, the Federal Circuit's expertise

20

in patent law actually isn't the relevant expertise.

21

And she explains at length and she cites a number of

22

prior Federal Circuit decisions, recognizing as well

23

that the district court who's lived with the case and

24

who's decided on the merits and who's seen the parties

25

and has spent sometimes years with the parties is really

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in a better position to decide whether or not the

2

party's litigating position was reasonable.

3

For that reason, if the Court has no further

4

questions, we'd urge it to vacate the judgment below and

5

remand the case to the court of appeals, with

6

instructions to consider the district court's award of

7

fees under the correct standard.

MR. DUNNER:

My

16

Allcare agrees that Pierce and Cooter are

17

highly relevant to this case, but we feel that those

18

cases support Allcare and not Highmark, and let me

19

explain.

20

The Pierce case starts out by talking about

21

the ­­ the traditional rule.

So the question is why ­­ why didn't the

Federal ­­ why didn't the Supreme Court apply the

2

traditional rule in Pierce and in Cooter?

3

answer certainly is not that they were fee cases,

4

because the Pierce case makes absolutely clear that it

5

was not enunciating a general rule for fee cases.

6

said it couldn't enunciate a general rule.

And the

It

7

On the other hand, what the ­­ what the

8

Court did was, it looked at the specifics involved,

9

which was the tribunal best qualified or best situated

10

to decide the issues in the case.

11

specifically with three different points.

12

And it dealt

Even if I assumed that

23

might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as

24

I read the district court's decision, it wasn't basing

25

its decision merely on that.

What it was basing it on,

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that

2

it thought constituted abusive litigation ­­ very little

3

prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims

4

because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a

5

theory that your expert didn't even agree with ­­ that

6

all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying

7

this litigation was abusive.

8

And I don't understand how that doesn't feed

9

into the objective unreasonableness, meaning that if you

10

had done the investigation you should have, you may have

11

had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would

12

have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed

13

things and you're likely not to have brought the suit.

That's how I read the district court's decision.

4

the points you're making.

5

There were four issues.

Two of them

6

involved claim construction, and the third one involved

7

claim construction ­­ the one we lost on.

8

one was whether or not the ­­ the ­­ Allcare had a right

9

to rely on what happened in the Eastern District of

The fourth

10

Virginia in which we had the same claim against a

11

different party and the two courts reached different

12

conclusions on the same issue on the same claim, which

13

alone should have ­­ should have found that it was

14

objectively reasonable but was not.

15

And the ­­ the last one was whether or not

16

alleged misconduct, misrepresentation to the Western

17

District of Pennsylvania before the case was

18

transferred, whether that was sanctionable, and the case

19

20

made absolutely clear that you cannot look at conduct

21

before another tribunal to decide whether a different

tribunal should sanction you.

Every one of those issues ­­ the three claim

We had no factual

And I suggest you look at the pages starting

7

with 19A and read the Court's opinion and they basically

8

said, contrary to Mr. Katyal's comment, the issue was

9

one of claim construction, it was not one of

10

infringement.

11

and the special master first gave a claim construction

12

favorable to Allcare.

13

hearing, he changed his opinion, and Judge Dyk's opinion

14

for the majority of the court basically notes this, that

15

he changed his view and he came out with a different

16

view.

17

There was a special master in the case,

And then in a summary judgment

But the issue was, is, and always a claim

19

construction issues are reviewed de novo.

And even they concede that claim

Now, a point has been made about pure issues

of law and impure issues of law.

claim construction is like that very often.

Your Honor, there are times

when it may be difficult to separate facts from law, and

many cases you can separate them, and moreover, the fact

that it is a mixed question of fact and law, which has

23

answer on their side.

24

suggest that the best answer is to let the legal issues

But there's a best answer, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that has a lot more experience, as Justice Alito

2

mentioned in one of the points that he made, rather than

3

district court judges who may get a few cases, may get a

4

lot of cases, depending what district you're in.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what about

6

Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure

7

issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're

8

talking about baselessness, that's something that the

9

district courts actually have more experience with,

10

whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA,

11

whether it's under qualified immunity.

12

they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert

13

than the Federal Circuit.

14

MR. DUNNER:

That's an issue

Your Honor, on the question

15

broadly of objective baselessness, one might say that is

16

so.

17

patent context, in a 285 context, where you've got legal

18

issues, where you've got claim construction issues, they

19

are certainly not better situated than the Federal

20

Circuit.

21

But on the question of objective baselessness in a

And I submit that certainly claim

22

construction is a perfect example, and the government,

23

in this case, acknowledges that claim construction, as

24

it calls it pure claim construct ­­ pure legal issues,

25

claim construction is reviewed de novo.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

So that is a

Official

1

perfect example of how district courts can disagree.

2

And this case is poster child for that because we had

3

two different courts going two different ways on exactly

4

the same point, exactly the same issue.

5

And the Pierce case raised, there are other

6

considerations involved, there are a lot of

7

considerations involved, but others in terms of which

8

tribunal is better situated.

9

pointed out that the size of the fee involved can be

10

very important.

11

briefly.

And the Pierce case

And I'd like to address that just very

12

The size of the fee involved in patent

13

cases, as my daughters would say, humongous.

14

I've been in two cases where the legal fees were

15

$30 million, and when you've got legal fees like that ­­

(Laughter.)

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. DUNNER:

Oh, no.

The fact is, when you've got

24

fees like that, there is going to be an appeal.

25

Typically, the appeal will be consolidated with the

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

merits appeal.

2

with the issues, both of them in the same case.

3

Judge Dyk pointed out, having reviewed the merits

decision, the 285 decision often involves the same kind

5

of questions, and it is not an enormous burden on the

6

courts to do that.

7

Typically, the Court will be dealing

And given the amount of the fee, there's

8

going to be an appeal when you've got large legal fees

So you're not ­­

additional appeals that you otherwise would not get.

was independently noted in Pierce as a factor.

Two of the items that you

11

MR. DUNNER:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ one of the problems

Written by you, Your Honor.

13

there, one of the conduct that was considered

14

unreasonable was suing in ­­ in a distant forum, very

15

far from where the defendants operated.

16

preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of

17

cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal

Circuit on those issues.

19

MR. DUNNER:

And claim

Your Honor, I have to

20

acknowledge that on an issue of whether or not a conduct

21

in a different circuit should be sanctionable in another

22

circuit, the Federal Circuit is certainly not more

23

expert on that kind of an issue than another court.

24

That ­­ that is merely an example of what happened in

25

this particular case.

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I will note that the Federal Circuit cited a

2

number of cases which held exactly that.

3

what happened in this case was that even the district

4

court ­­ Judge Means in the Northern District of

5

Texas ­­ noted that the Pennsylvania district court

6

itself did not seem to place very great reliance on it.

7

It probably was the least significant of all the factors

8

in the case.

9

And, moreover,

And so I would say it is merely an example

10

of a legal issue.

11

in which the Federal Circuit may not be more expert than

12

others, but there will be a lot of legal issues, since

13

we're dealing with conduct in patent cases, on which the

14

Federal Circuit is the most expert court.

15

And there will be some legal issues

And, in any event, we're talking about how

16

can we get uniformity of decision­making in the 285

17

area, and you've got both Rule 11 and the EAJA cases

18

went to 13 circuits, the 285 issues go to one circuit.

19

So it is much better to have a single court ruling on

20

those questions than to have multiple district courts.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you know, once you ­­

22

falls into.

Because the statement that you read, most

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawyers would agree with that statement as a general

2

principle.

3

And then the question becomes, well, it's

4

work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether

5

it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and

6

sometimes the other and they are really no key to it

7

exactly.

8

So what you're doing is saying, in an area

9

where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some

10

of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal

11

Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and

12

figure that thing out, while the other side says, look,

13

just leave it to the district court and tell them to

14

review.

15

Theirs is simpler.

16

MR. DUNNER:

What do you say?
Justice Breyer, my response is

17

that in many cases, there won't be a problem

18

distinguishing between law and fact.

19

problem ­­ there will be some cases where there may be

20

difficulty distinguishing between law and fact, and what

21

Pierce says and what Cooter says and what a lot of cases

22

say is which is the best tribunal, the district court or

23

the appellate court, to deal with it?

24

saying is there are all these factors ­­

case, you're going to get de novo review because the

3

Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction,

it had construed the claim properly and that you lost.

So you got de novo review.

The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue

the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or

not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it

losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the

12

district court said in this case, which you seem to

13

ignore.

was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the

15

Because it's not about right or wrong

2

and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation.
MR. DUNNER:

Your Honor, there are ­­ there

3

are two facets to the answer I would give to that

4

question.

5

One is that all of the points you made about

6

what the district court found were not issues on appeal.

7

The district court found lots of things, but the four

8

issues that went up on appeal did not deal with all the

9

facts you're talking about.

10

They dealt with legal

issues.

11

There was no prefiling investigation issue.

12

The Federal Circuit expressly found that, in a footnote

13

in its opinion, there was no prefiling investigation

14

issue in the final decision on appeal.

Because the

15

district court made multiple decisions.

One was a

16

Rule 11 decision in which he didn't provide a safe

17

harbor for anybody, and we went in and we asked them to

18

reconsider it, and he changed his opinion and dropped

19

everything against the attorneys.

20

The ­­ what went up to the court were four

21

issues, and they were four legal issues.

22

saying is that ­­ that Scott v. ­­ v. Harris, and

23

Justice Souter, in a concurring opinion in the PRE

24

case, said the same thing, that objective reasonableness

25

is a legal issue, reviewed de novo, and if you want

Sotomayor's question about the facts of this case,

20

because I think what you heard from Mr. Dunner

21

illuminates our position on why the Federal Circuit's de

22

novo standard is so problematic.

23

We warned, of course, that the de novo

24

standard would become a magnet for litigation and

25

encourage 285 losers to roll the dice, hoping that they

can repackage a factual dispute as a legal one in the

4

Breyer, you're picking up on.

And Pierce and Cooter warn against

And, Justice Sotomayor, they say, you've
already had a merits determination, as their one here.
This case proves that.

You heard Mr. Dunner

8

say, quote, There were no factual issues in this case,

9

and he talks about the Trigon ruling from the Eastern

10

District of Virginia.

11

Petition Appendix 63A, Trigon was irrelevant because the

12

question was infringement, not claim construction.

13

that was why sanctions were imposed.

14

doubt, here's what Allcare's own lawyer told the Federal

15

Circuit in 2009.

16

Summary judgment was granted at the district court in

17

this case for two reasons.

18

a lack of evidence from which a reasonable finder of

19

fact could determine the step of 52(c); and secondly,

20

the district court held even if there was evidence that

21

step 52(c) was performed, there was insufficient

22

evidence of direction or control.

23

As the district court here found,

And

And if there's any

Question from the Court:

24

like it's a claim construction issue for us as to the

meaning of this claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Answer from Allcare's lawyer:

I would

2

disagree that claim construction ought to be revisited

3

at this level.

4

was inappropriate to sua sponte revisit it.

5

In 1999, this court expressly stated it

Now, I'm sorry to belabor the facts here,

6

but I think they illustrate the wisdom of Justice

7

Scalia's opinion in Pierce, as followed by Cooter and

8

Koon, which is clever lawyers can always make arguments

9

on appeal, make them look ­­ make them look legal when

10

they were factual.

This case is example A of that.

11

Now, my friend on the other side has said

12

that ­­ that there wasn't history from 1946 to 1952.

13

encourage the Court to look to the ­­ to the cases cited

14

at pages 11 to 13 of our brief, and in particular to

15

look at Orrison v. Hoffberger, a Fourth Circuit case,

16

which says that in evaluating whether there's, quote, no

17

reasonable ground for the prosecution of a motion, the

18

court says it, quote, cannot be said there was abuse of

19

discretion.

20

We

In many of these cases, they refer to the

21

Abuse of discretion standard.

22

Mr. Dunner is right, that if it's a pure issue of law,

23

that is something as to which there isn't deference.

24

But when the question looks, as it does here, as it does

25

in 285 cases about objective baselessness, whether a

And, of course,

1

litigating position was reasonable after the fact in

2

collateral attorney fee litigation, this Court has

3

always said in all of these cases that

4

5

Now, Justice Alito, you had referred to the

6

size of the award here, and to be sure, it is different

7

than Pierce.

8

because in Cooter we're talking about Rule 11 sanctions

9

which can devastate an attorney's livelihood.

It's not different, of course, than Cooter

And

10

nonetheless, the Court in Cooter said they would

15

time, and what the Court said is defer to the district

16

court because the district court has the best

17

perspective, the kind of bird's eye view, a front seat

18

on litigation.

19

In Koon, the stakes were really high, jail

And that's why this case is different, than

20

court doesn't have a courtside or ringside, whatever
