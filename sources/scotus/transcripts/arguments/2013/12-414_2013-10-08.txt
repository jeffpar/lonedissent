ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
No court has ever held that AEDPA and

11

Strickland can be satisfied by presumption based on a

12

silent record.

13

Sixth Circuit adopted in granting habeas relief here.

Yet that is precisely the approach the

14

The record doesn't say how attorney Toca

15

investigated or what advice attorney Toca gave, but

16

based on that record silence, the Sixth Circuit assumed

17

Toca was ineffective.

18

the presumptions run the opposite way.

19

And under AEDPA and Strickland,

Now, if there's one thing that the Court

20

takes away from the oral argument this morning, I hope

21

that it's ­­ it's this:

22

Circuit's analysis is when it says, on page 19A of the

23

petition appendix, that Toca was deficient because the

24

record contains no evidence that he advised Titlow about

25

elements, evidence, or sentencing exposure.

How upside down the Sixth

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The correct question is whether the record

2

contains evidence that Toca did not do those things.

3

And that record silence is dispositive in favor of the

4

State on habeas review.

5

Now, if we could pull the curtain back and

6

see what really happened here, it may be the case that

7

Toca gave the proper advice, that he advised Titlow

8

about all the perils of going to trial, and that Titlow

9

continued to maintain her innocence.

10

Under Strickland, we're supposed to presume

11

that Toca did exactly that, especially when it's

12

Titlow's burden to satisfy the burden of proof, and she

13

failed to do that.

14

So I'd like to begin with our first issue,

15

which is AEDPA deference and the performance prong of

16

Strickland.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I just ask a question

18

about what you just said?

19

Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he

20

asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to

21

get up to speed.

The record does show that

I don't know anything about this case.

22

So Toca, himself, is saying, I'm not

23

acquainted with the case ­­ with the case.

24
25

MR. BURSCH:

Well, I don't think he's ­­

he's saying that, Justice Ginsburg.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

He's saying I'm not

Official

1

prepared for trial yet, but he says, I've got a lot of

2

materials here.

3

sentencing analysis with the ­­ the sentencing court in

4

this plea withdrawal hearing.

5

He goes through a very sophisticated

If you understand Michigan sentencing, if

6

you've got a manslaughter charge, there's a grid.

7

there's all kinds of different boxes that this could

8

have fit into, and he would have had to have analyzed

9

the evidence in order to determine that the two to five

10

range was appropriate for a manslaughter conviction and

11

to be able to then negotiate with the prosecutor about

12

whether that was or was not appropriate.

13
14
15

And

And so we know that ­­ that Toca did a lot
of work.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Was ­­ was the sentence that

16

was ultimately imposed after the trial for the

17

second­degree murder conviction within the guidelines ­­

18

within the Michigan guidelines?

19

MR. BURSCH:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, it was.

21

those guidelines were?

22

MR. BURSCH:

What ­­ do you know what

I don't recall, but it's

23

something on the range of 15 to 20 years.

24

we're talking about guidelines, it's important for the

25

Court to understand the difference between what the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And when

Official

1

guidelines called for, for manslaughter, and what was in

2

the plea agreement because Michigan's got this

3

indeterminate sentencing system, where you've got a

4

range for the lower end.

5

And so the plea deal was 7 to 15 years on

6

the lower end.

7

is, if they had gone to trial and lost for manslaughter,

8

the lower end was 2 years to 5 years.

9

And a manslaughter conviction ­­ that

And so it was entirely reasonable, from an

10

objective perspective, for an attorney, looking at this

11

record, at the time the plea was withdrawn, to say, yes,

12

if you want to maintain your innocence, the most likely

13

bad result at trial is most likely better than the plea

14

deal that you already have.

15

Sure, there's a risk that something worse

16

could happen, but this Court has said in Strickland and

17

Lafler and other places that bad predictions are not

18

deficient performance.

19

And so, really, when you get down to it,

20

it's really a problem with both the advice being

21

reasonable, but also the failure to carry the burden of

22

proof.

23

forward to demonstrate, as he was required to do ­­ she

24

was required to do, on the record, what Titlow ­­ or

25

what Toca did to investigate and what advice Toca

It's just the case that Titlow has not come

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

actually gave to Titlow.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When we're asking whether

3

the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the

4

proposition that a well­counselled defendant was now

5

insisting that he wanted to change his plea?

6

was only three days.

7

if we look

How do we –­ how do we factor that in?

just at what the counsel did ­­

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

important factor.

10

And there

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

I think that's an

­­ it may lead us to one

11

answer.

12

well­counselled defendant had now changed his mind and

13

wanted to withdraw, how do we factor that in?

14

But if we know that a previously

MR. BURSCH:

I think that's a significant

15

factor because, as you point out, before the ink was

16

even dry on the plea agreement, Titlow was already in

17

prison saying, I'm innocent, maybe I should be

18

withdrawing this plea, setting in motion a chain of

19

events that resulted in her firing the first attorney

20

and then hiring a second attorney.

21

And I don't think that the court of

22

appeals ­­ the Michigan Court of Appeals, articulated

23

any kind of a ­­ a per se rule about that ­­ you know,

24

certainly, we all understand that the ethical obligation

25

of the lawyer is that, if your client insists that they

7
Alderson Reporting Company

If ­­

Official

1

want to maintain their innocence, you have to allow them

2

to do that.

3

But what the court of appeals did, at pages

4

100 to 101A of the petition appendix, it looked at that,

5

but it also looked at the other evidence.

6

the Strickland presumption that Toca did his job.

7

then it says, at the very conclusion of that sentence,

8

based on all the proofs and arguments presented, Titlow

9

failed to satisfy her burden.

10
11

It looked at
And

This instance is one part

of that.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you ­­ could you

12

explain the procedural situation before the Michigan

13

Court of Appeals?

14

for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is

15

that ­­ that correct ­­

16

MR. BURSCH:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

There was a motion by the Respondent

That's correct.
­­ on the issue of

ineffective assistance of counsel?
And so the ­­ the question that the court of

20

appeals had to decide was whether the materials that

21

were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to

22

justify the hearing.

23

MR. BURSCH:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

That's correct.
And the court of appeals, I

gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other things or principally, the fact that the

2

Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the

3

reason for the ­­ the change of attorney.

4

So the issue really wasn't ­­ that was

5

before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in

6

the course of deciding whether there should be a remand,

7

they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was

8

an entitlement to relief.

9
10
11

Is that ­­ is that correct?

Or do I not

understand?
MR. BURSCH:

Just to be clear about Michigan

12

procedure, the defendant has an opportunity to ask for

13

what's called a Ginther hearing in Michigan, and that's

14

this evidentiary hearing to develop a record for an

15

ineffective assistance claim.

16

Titlow did not ask for that hearing in the

17

trial court.

18

Court of Appeals.

19

this is 7.211(C)(1)(a)(2) ­­ she was required to make a

20

proffer to justify that hearing on this motion to

21

remand.

22

She did ask for it in the ­­ the Michigan
But under the Michigan court rules ­­

And so the court of appeals, before it

23

issued its merits opinion, issues a one­sentence order

24

that says, that motion to remand is denied because you

25

have not proffered enough evidence to demonstrate that a

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

hearing is warranted.
And that makes sense because the only

3

proffer was the polygraph, the Lustig affidavit, and the

4

Pierson affidavit.

5

appropriate ­­ this often happens ­­ that Titlow herself

6

would have submitted an affidavit saying, this is what

7

Titlow knew ­­ or I'm sorry, this is what Toca knew,

8

this is what Toca advised, and I relied on that.

9

Or it sometimes is even the case, that the

You know, it would be entirely

10

previous defense counsel is willing to submit the

11

affidavit that says, this is what I knew, this is the

12

advice that I gave.

13

that's why you have this denial of the motion.

None of that was there.

And so

14

So now, in the context of that record and,

15

Justice Kennedy, the claim of innocence and this whole

16

thing being set in motion by that claim of innocence, it

17

was quite easy for the Michigan Court of Appeals to say

18

that, on the proofs presented and in light of the

19

Strickland presumption, there was nothing objectively

20

unreasonable about allowing Titlow to recall her plea.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In just thinking about that

22

Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of

23

troubling line in it to me.

24

proclaims his innocence, it is not objectively

25

unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain

It says, "When a defendant

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may

2

appear."

3

And one way to read this is it's a kind of

4

categorical rule, which says that, when the defendant

5

says he is innocent, basically your obligations to

6

properly advise him about a plea, go away.

7

understand you not to read it that way.

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, I

Correct.
So could you tell me a

10

little bit about what you think of that question and why

11

you read the sentence the way you read the sentence?

12

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

I think it would be very

13

difficult to defend the opinion if that was the only

14

sentence of analysis because we do not agree that a

15

simple claim of innocence by your client relieves the

16

attorney of any responsibility to do anything.

17

not what happened here.

That's

18

Four sentences before the sentence you just

19

read on page 101A, the court of appeals talks about the

20

Strickland presumption that the attorney is doing his or

21

her job.

22

read, on page 102A, the Michigan Court of Appeals

23

specifically says, "On the proofs and arguments offered

24

by defendant, there is no ineffective assistance here."

25

And so that was part of a larger discussion

Two sentences after that sentence you just

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about attorneys who do their job when their clients are

2

claiming innocence.

3

together.

And you have to put all that

4

And I think it's significant, also, that the

5

Michigan Court of Appeals was giving Titlow the benefit

6

of the doubt here because, on page 100A, just one page

7

earlier, it assumes Titlow's position, that is that Toca

8

actually gave the advice to withdraw the plea.

9

even know that because we don't have credible evidence

10
11

We don't

in this record.
We don't have an affidavit from Titlow.

We

12

don't have an affidavit from Toca that indicates that

13

Toca ever gave that advice.

14

the curtain back, it may very well have been, as we

15

assume under Strickland, that he totally and completely

16

advised about all the risks of trial before the plea was

17

withdrawn.

18
19

Again, if you could draw

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you clarify something

for me about habeas corpus law?

20

MR. BURSCH:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
I ­­ I have to imagine the

22

facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical.

23

the district attorney says, this lawyer was adequate,

24

and really, two factors make that obvious.

25

factor is that the client said that she was innocent,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

That ­­ The U.S. ­­

The first

Official

1

and taking that into account with the other things, that

2

could have justified, adequately, his withdrawal of the

3

plea and not convincing her not to.

4

Second, the sentence that the district

5

attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater

6

than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could

7

have justified it.

8

Now, it writes ­­ the court then writes in

9

its opinion only the second reason and never mentions

10

the first.

11

thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.

12

she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's

13

pretty flimsy.

14

rely on it.

15

Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court
Gee,

The first isn't so bad, but they didn't

Okay.

So now, what is the habeas court supposed to

16

do?

17

back to the State court first?

18

supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up

19

its own mind?

Is ­­ should the ­­ should the defendant have gone

20

How does this work?

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

know the answer.

24

MR. BURSCH:

25

Is the habeas court

That's a delightful question.
I'm glad.

I would love to

And I want to start with a

record response to distinguish our case from your

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

hypothetical and then address the habeas question.

2

hypothetical assumed that the State court only mentioned

3

one of the two reasons, and here, obviously, the court

4

of appeals talked about innocence.

5

at length.

6

We've discussed that

But on page 100A of the opinion, the court

7

of appeals also notes that the defendant moved to

8

withdraw her plea because the agreed­upon sentence

9

exceeded the sentencing guidelines range.

10

Your

So they are

both here.

11

But assuming your hypothetical that we only

12

had one and not two, the question is really easy under

13

2254 because, so long as the decision was not a

14

misapplication of this Court's clearly established

15

precedent, there is no violation, even if their

16

reasoning might not have been as strong as it could have

17

been, had they mentioned the other reason.

18

So next habeas question, does the defendant

19

get an opportunity to have a Federal habeas hearing to

20

further develop the record about what happened?

21

answer is no, because under 2254(e)(1) and (e)(2), there

22

is a presumption of correctness about everything that

23

was found in the State court system.

24
25

And the

And there is no right to get a Federal
evidentiary hearing if you have not adequately pursued

Alderson Reporting Company

1

your ability to develop the record in the State court.

2

And as Justice Alito has already pointed

3

out, it was Titlow's failure, not the State's failure,

4

to properly proffer evidence to get the Ginther hearing.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you make of the fact

6

that ­­ what do you make of the fact that, at the change

7

of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the

8

claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the

9

sentence was above the guidelines?

10

MR. BURSCH:

I don't think that's

11

significant because those two things are not mutually

12

exclusive.

13

hearts, that she's innocent, and at the same time, the

14

attorney could acknowledge that there are facts in the

15

record already admitted that a reasonable jury could

16

conclude that you were guilty of manslaughter.

17

The defendant could believe, in her heart of

And so it would not be inconsistent for that

18

attorney to argue for a lower guidelines range in the

19

plea, and so there's really nothing inconsistent about

20

that.

21

just the failure of the burden of proof.

22

Circuit is upside­down when it reads into the record's

23

silence ineffective assistance.

24
25

But the important thing to understand here is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Sixth

Appendix, page 295, and this is Titlow's statement.

3

persuaded to withdraw my plea agreement because an

4

attorney promised me he would represent me.

5

"I

6

So that sounds like she was persuaded by

7

Mr. Toca to go to trial because she could win.

8

9

MR. BURSCH:

And he

Well, first, I have to disagree

10

with the premise of your question, Justice Ginsburg,

11

because there is no doubt that Toca made an appraisal.

12

He had ­­ you know, the quote from the plea withdrawal

13

hearing is "a lot of materials," and he made a very

14

sophisticated argument about what the guidelines range

15

should be, and that range was lower than the plea

16

actually offered.

17

But what you need to understand about this

18

testimony from Titlow right here, this was a plea for

19

leniency at sentencing.

motion for remand.

This was not part of the

What ­­ what Titlow could have done

In addition, you've got to take the context

25

of this and juxtapose it against the other things that

1

Titlow was saying at this very same sentencing hearing.

2

And it ­­ it's remarkable, really, that she says both of

these things.

4

She says she feels sorry for her Aunt Billie

for being this manipulating and evil person and thanks

22

Strickland prejudice in the context of a rejected plea

1

finding of causation, the statement should be judged

2

based on all the objective circumstances.

Second, when a Federal habeas court finds a

4

Sixth Amendment violation in the rejected plea context,

5

it should not categorically require the government to

6

reoffer a rejected plea deal.

7

left to the sentencing court, and requiring the

8

government to reoffer a rejected plea deal in a context

9

like this case where the plea agreement required the

10

defendant to do something other than plead guilty ­­

11

give testimony against her aunt ­­ it doesn't make

12

sense, and the government should not be required to make

13

the reoffer.

14

That decision should be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you need to

give us some examples of things that don't count.

5

thought it was in your brief that you had said, look,

6

the fact that it turns out to have been a very bad

7

deal ­­ you know, the bargain was one year, and the

8

sentence after guilty was 20 years, that, I take it, you

9

say is not a corroborating factor.

10

MS. O'CONNELL:

Not in this case.

I

The ­­

11

the disparity between the sentence that a person

12

receives after the plea deal and the sentence that they

13

received after a trial is going to be present in every

14

case.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

Right.
In fact, it has to be for

17

prejudice.

18

or something to support the defendant's statement in a

19

case where, like some of the court of appeals' opinions,

20

the defendant was misadvised on sentencing exposure.

21

The lawyer said, well, you should reject this plea deal

22

for 15 years because the maximum that you could get at

23

trial is 20, and so it's worth the risk.

That could be a corroborating circumstance

24

But this defendant understood completely and

25

said multiple times, on the record, that she understood

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the ­­ the potential sentence for a murder

2

conviction was a life sentence and that that was back on

3

the table, if she withdrew the plea offer.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

On the question of this ­­

5

of this sentence, what do you think were the ­­ the

6

range of reasonable sentences that could have been

7

imposed in compliance with our recent decisions?

8

You have ­­ you have the sentence that was

9

offered before the trial, but that was predicated on, A,

10

testimony and, B, not having to go to trial.

11

you have the sentence that was imposed after the trial,

12

when there was no testimony and there was a trial.

13

So what was the ­­ what do you think a trial

14

court could reasonably do in that situation, just split

15

the difference?

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

And then

Well, I think the trial

17

court has a lot of discretion under the Court's opinion,

18

but I think what ­­ what should have happened in this

19

circumstance is to go back to the sentencing court, not

20

require the government to reoffer this plea deal, which

21

just simply can't be ­­ can't be offered and accepted

22

anymore.

23

being reoffered, they're saying we're offering

25

It doesn't make sense.

that, because there is no remedy, that the Court

shouldn't address the first or second questions.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But we're in a position now,

2

aren't we, where the State court can do exactly that,

3

can say the circumstances have changed and ­­ and so

4

leave everything undisturbed.

5

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

The problem ­­ one of

6

the problems here is that the Sixth Circuit sort of

7

took, as a given, that in circumstances like this, that

8

the ­­ the original plea offer has to be reoffered.

9

what we think the court was saying in Lafler is that

10

And

that's one thing that's on the table.

11

It's not necessarily required in every case.

12

There could be other creative remedies, like there could

13

be a defendant who can no longer ­­ who missed the

14

opportunity to give the testimony she was supposed to

15

give, but perhaps she has information on somebody else,

16

and so maybe we could do a renegotiation of the plea.

17

The Sixth Circuit, we do not think, should

18

be just requiring after it finds a Sixth Amendment

19

violation that the government reoffer a plea agreement

20

in circumstances that are different from those in

21

Lafler.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that ­­ I

23

mean, the court didn't say that the court ­­ that the

court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

what the Court was saying is that the court below has to

the risks of either accepting a plea, withdrawing a

plea, whatever the case.

This is a very significant step in this matter.

And yet, the court instructs a renewal,

MS. NEWMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg ­­

5

Ginsburg, as the Court decided last term in

6

Lafler v. Cooper, the point of the remedy is to put the

7

defendant as closely as possible back in the position he

or she would have been in, but for the ineffective

10

MS. NEWMAN:

Well, again, referring to

Lafler v. Cooper, the remedy goes ­­ the Sixth Amendment

If there is an

to reoffer the manslaughter plea, which has already been

ordered in ­­ in Lafler v. Cooper, to allow the trial

determination based on the record.

anything different in this case.

In the other cases

48

that I have reviewed from the Sixth Circuit, I have not

seen a case that relied only on subjective testimony, so

I can't point to a case where the Sixth Circuit is doing

something different than any other case, and I don't

believe anyone else has pointed to a particular case.

that the Court of Appeals made based on the record

before it, and actually, the legal standard under AEDPA

is not clearly wrong.

23

reprinted in our blue brief, it is presumed correct, and

that presumption can only be overcome by clear and

And it's a little ironic that they

But assume that everything that she says is

12

correct and that Toca did give the advice to withdraw

13

the plea, that still doesn't mean that it's bad advice

14

when you apply the AEDPA and Strickland rubrics because,

15

as Justice Alito pointed out, the differentiation in the

16

manslaughter guidelines and what was actually in the

17

plea actually makes this objectively reasonable advice.

18

And, in fact, it's more than that because,

19

at the time the plea was withdrawn, consider all the

20

facts that were known from talking to the prosecutor,

21

looking in the police file and everything else that ­­

22

that Toca presumably did.

23

about this critical Chahine testimony, which only came

24

out at trial, that it was actually Titlow who held Uncle

11

this.

12

Sixth Circuit takes a different approach.

13

And you're exactly right, Chief Justice, that the

The Sixth Circuit says, although some

14

circuits have held that a defendant must support his own

15

assertion that he would have accepted the offer with

16

additional objective evidence, we, in this circuit, have

17

declined to adopt such a requirement.

18

And you can see how that difference played

19

out in this very case because the Sixth Circuit didn't

20

look at all the other evidence that was in the record

21

that was contrary to this self­serving statement that

22

Titlow made; that Titlow had the plea in hand and,

23

before the ink was even dry, was already professing

24

innocence and talking to other lawyers; that she fired

25

wanted to ­­ to withdraw the plea; that she did not have

2

a propensity for truthfulness.

3

At trial, she lied about the fact that she

4

was drunk, when she was not, the night of the murder.

5

The evidence came out that she asked Chahine to lie

6

about the alibi, and she hid the murder weapon.

7

then you've got all these statements at the sentencing

8

hearing and post remand, where she's continually

9

asserting her innocence.

10

And

It's happening all the time.

When you consider all that objectively,

11

under the other circuit standards, clearly, that would

12

not be sufficient to establish prejudice here.
