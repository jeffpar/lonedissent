Bond v. United States.

Mr. Clement?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the statute at issue here really does

12

reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the

13

nation, as the government insists, then it clearly

14

exceeds Congress' limited and enumerated powers.

15

Court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock

16

principle of our federalist system that Congress lacks a

17

general police power to criminalize conduct without

18

regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a

19

matter of distinctly Federal concern.

This

20

The President's negotiation and the Senate's

21

ratification of a treaty with a foreign nation does not

22

change that bedrock principle of our constitutional

23

system.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Clement, you

said that ­­ that the treaty is valid and the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words

2

of the treaty without adding anything.

3

that the treaty could be constitutional, but the

4

implementing legislation that adds nothing is

5

unconstitutional.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

So it's a puzzle

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

7

guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is

8

true that the convention in the statute used similar

9

terms and terminology, but there's one very important

10

difference between the convention and the statute, and

11

that actually differentiates this case from Missouri v.

12

Holland.

13

And that difference is that the convention

14

itself doesn't directly regulate individual conduct at

15

all.

16

And so all the ­­ all the convention does ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the convention ­­ but

17

the convention tells the State parties, go regulate

18

individual conduct in exactly the way that this

19

convention regulates State parties.

20

legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just

21

mirror the convention as the convention contemplated.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

And then what the

Well, Justice Kagan, to be

23

quite precise, though, what the convention says ­­ and

24

this is Article 7, Section 1, it's 33a of the Blue Brief

25

appendix.

What it says is that each nation state that

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

signs the convention agrees, in accordance with its

2

constitutional processes, to pass penal laws that make

3

unlawful for individuals conduct that would violate the

4

convention, if undertaken by a nation state.

5

And I would respectfully suggest that making

6

that translation, if you will, between what violates the

7

convention if you're a nation state and what would be

8

comparable individual conduct is not obvious.

9

the government does that through penal legislation,

And when

10

there's no reason why that penal legislation shouldn't

11

have to comply ­­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why not?
­­ as we promised with our ­­
Mr. Clement, why not?

15

Meaning there ­­ there can be no doubt that chemical

16

weaponry is at the forefront of our foreign policy

17

efforts right now.

18

It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much

19

energy criticizing Syria, when if this Court were now to

20

declare that our joining or creating legislation to

21

implement the treaty was unconstitutional.

22

putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign

23

relations.

24
25

Look at the Syria situation alone.

We're

Why is it ­­ if it's okay to regulate the
possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that

2

can kill or maim another human being ­­ a chemical that

3

can kill or maim another human being?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think ­­
I don't understand where

6

the disconnect is in terms of our Federal or State

7

system.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

think it really gets down to the difference between

10

Raich on the one hand and Lopez on the other, which, as

11

this Court has held, that it is a classic and rational

12

way to regulate commerce, to basically prohibit certain

13

items from commerce.

14

And ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why isn't this

15

saying ­­ there's no dispute that these chemicals were

16

transported against ­­ along interstate lines.

17

not even disputed in this case.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

That's

Well ­­ but I don't think it

19

was really disputed in Lopez that the firearm would have

20

had to cross State lines.

21

the Federal statute was not structured in a way that had

22

a jurisdictional nexus that made the statute only

23

applicable as a regulation.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the problem in Lopez was

Now ­­
Well, we didn't take this

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case to ­­ to decide the Commerce Clause question, did

2

we?

3

asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was

4

whether the treaty supported the ­­ the laws.

5

The government didn't even assert it below.

MR. CLEMENT:

It

That's right, Justice Scalia.

6

And we do think that the government, like a private

7

party, can waive a constitutional argument.

8

On the other hand, I would say that we're

9

not particularly concerned about the Commerce Clause

10

argument because we think the Commerce Clause argument

11

has the same basic defect as the treaty power argument,

12

which is that the police ­­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think ­­ do you

14

think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice

15

Ginsburg's question, could the ­­ could this treaty have

16

itself regulated individual conduct?

17

have been self­executing?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Could the treaty

Well, I think that's an

19

interesting question, and I don't think the Court needs

20

to answer it.

21

there really were a self­executing treaty that tried to

22

impose criminal prohibitions, and I don't think there is

23

any treaty like that, but if there were one, I would

24

say, here, that it violates the Constitution for the

25

same basic reasons that this implementing legislation

I mean, I would take the position that if

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does.

But I ­­ but I ­­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

in the Constitution?

4

power that does not have subject matter limitations.

5

And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history,

6

it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of

7

subject matter limitations, and James Madison and others

8

decided, quite self­consciously, not to impose them.

9
10
11

So where would you find that
Because there's clearly a treaty

So where would you find that limitation in
the Constitution.
MR. CLEMENT:

I would find that limitation

12

in the structural provisions of the Constitution and the

13

enumerated powers of Congress.

14

would be very ­­

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I would say that it

But this is an enumerated

16

power.

17

you have to find a constraint on the treaty power.

18

Where does it come from?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

The enumerated power is the treaty power.

Well, I think

So

that where it

20

would come from, again, is the structural provisions of

21

the Constitution.

22

that purported, at a national level, to commandeer State

23

and local police officers, I would think that there

24

might be ­­ you could call it a Tenth Amendment

25

objection, you could call it an enumerated power

If we had a self­executing treaty

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

objection.

There might be an objection to that treaty.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, don't you think the

3

word "treaty" has some meaning?

4

that, going back to the beginning of the country, there

5

have been many treaties that have been implemented in

6

ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within

7

the province of the States.

8

It is certainly true

One of the original purposes of the­­

9

objectives of the Constitution was to deal with ­­ with

10

a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed

11

to British creditors.

12

the property rights of ­­ of foreign subjects, about the

13

treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that

14

are moving across international borders, about

15

extradition and all of those.

And there have been cases about

16

But in all of those, until fairly recently,

17

certainly until, generally, after World War II, all of

18

those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern

19

of a foreign State.

20

So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a

21

treaty, what it was understood to mean when the

22

Constitution was adopted?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

That was the purpose of a treaty.

I think that's right,

24

Justice Alito.

25

Kagan's question, to fully accept the premise that

And I didn't mean, in answering Justice

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's no limit on the treaty power whatsoever.

2

do think that it's important to recognize that, in the

3

context of non­self­executing treaties, there's a real

4

opportunity to leave for another day the question of

5

whether the treaty itself is valid because, sometimes, a

6

treaty is non­self­executing precisely because the

7

Senate recognizes ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I

If you had been the

President's counsel, would you have advised him that it
was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?
MR. CLEMENT:

No.

Absolutely not,

12

Justice Kennedy, but that's precisely because it's a

13

valid non­self­executing treaty.

14

doesn't do anything to direct ­­ directly regulate

15

individual conduct.

16

counsel, I would have said, honestly, Mr. President, I

17

don't think this requires us to have any law that

18

applies to garden variety assaults with chemicals.

19

By its terms, it

And if I were the President's

But if we need that to discharge our treaty

20

obligations, the States are absolutely ready and able to

21

shoulder that task.

22

that doesn't have a general assault statute that would

23

be covered by this conduct.

24

doesn't have a murder statute to cover this conduct ­­

25

There's no State in this country

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is no State that

Mr. Clement, there's an

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

irony in what you just said, because the victim, many

2

times, went to the State police and said, please help

3

me.

4

finally they said, go to the post office.

5

And they turned her away a dozen times.

And

So this doesn't seem to be ­­ you're arguing

6

that this trenches on the State's domain.

7

this very case, it wasn't until the State referred her

8

to the post office, Federal officials, that she got any

9

action.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

And, yet, in

Well, Justice Ginsburg, one

11

way to understand that is that the State of Pennsylvania

12

exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue

13

this matter.

14

the government says that that exercise of prosecutorial

15

discretion put us in violation of our treaty

16

obligations.

17

I don't think that ­­ I don't even think

Our treaty obligation, at most, is to have a

18

law that prohibits this conduct, which the States

19

certainly do.

20

that every single use ­­ malicious use of chemicals is,

21

in fact, prosecuted by the State or local officials.

22

The treaty obligation is not to make sure

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, could I make

23

sure I understand your test?

24

with respect to every prosecution under this ­­ under

25

this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the

Your test is to say that

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or

2

international concerns?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that ­­ is that your test?
No, that's not my test,

4

Justice Kagan.

5

other end of the stick, which is to say, that the one

6

thing I think I know from this Court's precedence is

7

that the Federal government doesn't have a general

8

police power.

I would actually come at it from the

9

So as I look at this statute, it can either

10

be saved by essentially creating a jurisdictional

11

element out of the phrase "peaceful" and equating it

12

with non­war­like or, if the statute really has this

13

general character, then at least as applied to the

14

chemicals here, which are pure dual use chemicals, it

15

can't be constitutionally applied.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I'm still

17

looking for a test, and I thought that the test that I

18

just articulated was really directly out of your briefs.

19

But if it's ­­ if ­­ if you're suggesting that

20

that's not the test, give me the test that we're

21

supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other

22

as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

It's whether the Federal

24

statute exercises a general police power.

25

does ­­

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And if it

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That sounds like a facial

2

challenge.

3

talk about that this was an as­applied challenge to this

4

particular prosecution.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Now, I thought that you made very careful to

Well, that's because the only

6

relief I'm seeking is to have my client's conviction

7

vacated, so this is the classic as­applied challenge.

8

Now, the reasoning that the Court may employ in

9

vindicating my as­applied challenge may suggest that the

10

statute is unconstitutional in some or all of different

11

applications, but our claim has always been that

12

the ­­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're saying, if the

14

statute extends to things that we've generally thought

15

of as part of the police power, that's sufficient.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

I would say that, if a Federal

17

statute exercises the police power ­­ by which I mean it

18

criminalizes conduct without regard to jurisdictional

19

element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal

20

concern, then that statute exceeds Congress' power.

21

That was the case in Lopez; that was the case in

22

Morrison.

23

construction, that's the case here.

24
25

And I think, unless you accept our narrowing

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

Nexus ­­ nexus to a

national concern, again, is what I understood you to say

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in your brief.

2

you tell me whether your test meets it.

3

But let me give you a hypothetical, and

Let's say it's the same convention, except

4

it relates only to Sarin gas, and ­­ and there's a

5

chemist out there and ­­ you know, the ­­ the

6

implementing legislation mirrors the convention.

7

There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin

8

gas ­­ I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture ­­ and

9

sends it through the ducts of a house and kills

10

everybody in it.

11

Does that have a nexus to national concerns?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

It does, Your Honor, and it

13

would be valid legislation precisely because Sarin is

14

something that, clearly, Congress could prohibit in all

15

its uses.

16

to Sarin gas or other things, certainly, on Schedule

17

I ­­ there are some Schedule I substances that are

18

talked about both in the convention and the treaty ­­

19

those things are always unlawful.

And as I understand how this statute applies

20

What is particularly unusual about the

21

statute's application to something like potassium

22

dichromate or vinegar or whatever you have is that, in

23

most of its possession and uses, it's perfectly lawful,

24

and what makes it a chemical weapon in the government's

25

theory is when it's used purely intrastate in a

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

malicious way.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So ­­ but this is ­­ in my

3

hypothetical ­­ and you didn't run away from it at all;

4

I applaud that.

5

domestic use ­­ you know, it's just this chemist didn't

6

like his neighbor and used Sarin gas.

7

that the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did

8

was define the category of chemicals more broadly.

9

In my hypothetical, it's a completely

And you're saying

And I guess what I want to know is you are

10

imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get

11

inside the head of treaty makers to think about ­­ you

12

know, in this case, we understand that there's a

13

national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't

14

think that there's a sufficient national interest in regulating

15

some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down

16

the line.

17

It seems to me a completely indeterminate

18

test and one that would have judges take the place of

19

treaty makers, in terms of deciding what is in the

20

national and international interest.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, I would

22

beg to differ.

23

this case avoids judges being put in that difficult

24

position, precisely because we distinguish, unlike the

25

government, between the validity of the convention and

I actually think that our approach to

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the validity of the implementing legislation.
And then, as to the implementing

3

legislation, we simply ask the courts to do what they do

4

in every other context, which is to check and see if

5

that implementing legislation is consistent with our

6

basic chartering document.

7

And it's the government's position, which I

8

don't really understand why this would work, but their

9

theory is that, if the non­self­executing treaty is

10

valid, then the implementing legislation is ipso facto

11

somehow valid.

12
13
14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And do you think it would be

difficult ­­
MR. CLEMENT:

And think about the convention

15

that was before this Court in the Medellin case, the

16

Vienna Convention on Consular Notification.

17

obligation on any arresting official to provide

18

notification to the consulate about an arrested foreign

19

national.

20

It puts an

Now, I suppose it would be a perfectly

21

rational way to implement that convention to have a

22

national police force, and so every arresting officer is

23

a Federal officer who's fully apprised of the Vienna

24

Convention responsibilities.

25

way to implement the treaty, but it wouldn't be remotely

That would be a rational

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

consistent with our Constitution.
On the other hand, that same valid

3

non­self­executing treaty can be validly implemented by

4

chartering the State Department to work with police

5

officers on a State and local level to understand their

6

obligations.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think it would be

8

difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility

9

that there is any other country in the world that has

10

the slightest interest in how the United States or any

11

of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation

12

that's involved in this case?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Alito, I think that

14

would be one way of approaching the question.

15

that would be a ­­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think

Do you think that would be

17

beyond the ­­ that would be beyond the ability of

18

Federal judges when they ­­ when a case like this comes

19

before them?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think it would be

21

beyond their ability.

22

beyond ­­ beyond the ability of a Federal judge to say,

23

okay, let's hypothetically ask the question in the

24

absence of a non­self­executing treaty, would Congress

25

have the power to pass this statute?

I also don't think it would be

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And if the answer to that is no, then I

2

think the burden sort of shifts to figure out why it is

3

that the treaty adds something to the powers of the

4

Federal government.

5

And I think this, just to make clear, I

6

think this is a very different context from what the

7

Court had in Missouri v. Holland because, there, the

8

treaty itself prohibited individual action.

9

individual violated the treaty if they took a migratory

10
11

An

bird out of season.
And so in that sense, the enforcement

12

statute did nothing more than put a criminal penalty on

13

violating conduct that was already prohibited to the

14

individual.

15

And in that ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it ­­ is it one way to

16

characterize your argument or is it too unfairly

17

confining to your argument to say that what you're

18

suggesting is something like a clear statement rule,

19

that, if the treaty intends nation states to have their

20

own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum, it

21

has to say so, and then we will come to the question of

22

whether or not they can do it?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that would be a fair

24

characterization of our argument, but only to add that

25

this would be the anti­clear statement case.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Because

Official

1

the one place that this convention talks about imposing

2

obligations on individuals, it's a promise by the nation

3

state to pass penal legislation that is in accordance

4

with their constitutional systems.

5

So it's very bizarre ­­ that's Article VII,

6

Section 1, it's, I think, 33a.

7

when the only way we're reaching individual conduct

8

here, unlike the treaty in Holland, is a United States

9

promise to pass legislation that comports with our

And so it's very bizarre

10

constitutional process, to say that the convention,

11

therefore, allow us to pass legislation that doesn't

12

comport with our constitutional process.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Clement, I ­­ I don't

14

understand how ­­ how you distinguish Sarin gas.

15

Sarin gas different from vinegar?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Why is

Because Sarin gas is, I think,

17

more equivalent to something that the Congress would try

18

to deal with like the way it dealt with marijuana in

19

that, when you're talking about things where the Federal

21

Government is trying to prohibit it, then there's a

22

greater Federal power to do that.

23

I think ­­ it's just a reflection of the idea

And I think, with Sarin gas, you could

24

imagine ­­ put aside the commerce power for a second,

25

put aside the treaty power ­­ it may be that, with Sarin

gas, even under the war powers, the Federal Congress can

2

say, look, that's something that's ­­ you know, it's

3

sort of inherently a chemical weapon, and we're going to

4

prohibit people from having that.

5

That's very different from these situations

6

where, if you think about it, the only thing that makes

7

these chemicals chemical weapons instead of chemicals is

8

their internal, intrastate use in a malicious way.

9

that's different, I think, from at least a hypothetical

And

10

statute that says, look, here are ­­ I mean, there's

11

three schedules in the statute, 43 different chemicals

12

that are particularly problematic.

13

If the Federal government wants to regulate

14

those and prohibit the unauthorized possession of those,

15

I don't see why they couldn't do that with or without

16

the treaty.

17

the idea that these chemicals, everything, rat poison,

18

vinegar, whatever it is, these things are perfectly

19

lawful, we don't think of them as chemical weapons,

20

unless and until they're used in a malicious way, and

21

then all of a sudden, they become classified as chemical

22

weapons.

23

But when ­­ what is so anomalous here is

That's a very odd statute.

But it does, I

24

think, operate in a way that is just inconsistent with

25

the bedrock principle that the Federal Congress just

doesn't have this kind of police power.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the chemical used here

3

one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the

4

treaty?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't believe so.

It's

6

certainly not one that is listed on the three schedules.

7

There are 43 chemicals.

8

And I do think there is an important difference

9

because ­­ this is perhaps an odd way to think about it,

Neither of these are on there.

10

but ­­ you know, this is a statute that's really trying

11

to regulate nouns, chemical weapons.

12

to something like weaponized chemicals or Sarin gas, it

13

makes sense to say those are chemical weapons.

14

And with respect

But with respect to otherwise harmless

15

chemicals, the only thing that under the government's

16

theory turns them from chemical weapons ­­ I'm sorry ­­

17

from chemicals into chemical weapons isn't a noun, it's

18

a verb.

19

a very odd sort of situation.

20

It's their malicious use.

And that puts you in

And I think that ­­ you know, if Congress

21

had come in and said, look, there are certain chemicals

22

that, by their very nature, are almost inherently

23

weaponized, I think Congress would have a lot more

24

authority to proceed in that kind of situation.

points.

First of all, generally, you might be right

something else.

something that has a distinct Federal concern.

The treaty power.
Well, I don't think that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's what was said in

the ­­
MR. CLEMENT:

­­ especially when there's

11

this much of a disconnect between what the treaty power

12

does and what the statute does, which is the treaty,

13

again, does not directly regulate at all individual

14

conduct.

15

It is regulated at nation state conduct.

Now, with all due respect, I don't think

16

that nation states poison romantic rivals, attempt to

17

commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their

18

houses.

19

think it's ­­ it's hard to draw an analogy between

20

what's forbidden to a nation state and the individual

21

action.

And so, when individuals do those things, I

22

But any work that is done in the statute by

23

drawing that analogy is done by the statute and not by

the convention.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if a terrorist took

20

covered.

So no matter how you decide that

to think about what the convention is after, it is not

its treaty obligations and prosecutes this horrible

3

deployment of chemical weapons.

4

Nobody would say that because nobody

5

speaking normal English would identify this as a

6

deployment of chemical weapons at all.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's

8

absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement

9

as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions,

10

that the treaty said, go enforce this as to individuals

11

and do it consistent with your constitutional processes.

12

And then Congress passes a law that is

13

consistent with its constitutional processes, and it

14

completely mirrors the treaty.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Justice Kagan,

16

neither of which will surprise you, I suppose.

24

effect to that treaty power.

States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of

sharing that power in any way.

3

And he says ­­ you know, it's just these

4

invisible radiations that you think come from the

5

structure of the Constitution.

6

rejected this argument, the same argument that you're

7

making, the penumbras and emanations of the

8

Constitution.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

And he specifically

Justice Kagan, I think you

10

have to read Missouri v. Holland both in the context of

11

the treaty that the Court had before it and the argument

12

that it had before it.

13

argument in Missouri v. Holland, one that no modern

14

litigant would make.

15

went out of their way to identify a conflict between the

16

Federal treaty and State law and said, therefore, we win

17

under the Supremacy Clause.

Missouri made a very strange

They made an argument that ­­ they

18

And Holmes scratched his head and said no.

19

The treaty under ­­ under Article 6 is supreme to both

20

State law and not the other way around.

21

said this one sentence that sort of bedeviled the lower

22

courts here, which says, well, and if the treaty's

23

valid, of course, the legislation is valid.

But he also

24

That made sense in the context of the treaty

25

he had before him because he had a treaty that directly

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prohibited individual conduct and a statute that

2

enforced that individualized prohibition with criminal

3

penalties.

4

So in that case, I suppose it was right,

5

that the treaty and the implementing legislation stood

6

or fell together.

That's not the case here.

If I could reserve my time.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The framers gave the Federal Government

15

exclusive control over the treaty function to ensure

16

that it could knit the nation together as one and allow

17

it to be fully sovereign in the conduct of foreign

18

affairs.

19

Petitioner's ad hoc "too local" limit on the

20

treaty power can't be squared with a judgment the

21

framers made, this Court's precedent, or consistent

22

historical practice since the time of the founding, and

23

it would compromise foreign affairs and national

24

security interests of the first order.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

27
Alderson Reporting Company

General, let's

Official

1

suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the ­­ the

2

international convention to ensure that national

3

legislatures have full authority to carry out their

4

obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the

5

police power.

6

And Congress passes a statute saying we have

7

the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant

8

to this international convention that the President has

9

signed.

10

Any problem with that?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There may well be.

Let

11

me walk through the analysis that I think you'd have to

12

go through.

13

Mr. Chief Justice, that it seems unimaginable that a

14

convention of that kind would be ratified by two­thirds

15

of the Senate, which it would have to be ­­

First, I would make the point,

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why?
It also seems

18

unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.

19

let's leave that.

20

(Laughter.)

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

22
23

But

And that does go to the

point ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And just to press it

24

further, the ­­ the point is that it's a transfer of

25

authority from the States to the national legislature.

26

I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to say, well, we'd never do that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, the framers thought

3

that the two­thirds guarantee ­­ the two­thirds

4

ratification requirement, was an important structural

5

guarantee to protect the interests of the States.

6
7
8
9
10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

At a time when the

Senate was elected by the State legislatures.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But there's no doubt that the framers thought that would
be an important protection.
But beyond that, this Court has said that ­­

12

that there is an inquiry.

13

never held that a ratified treaty exceeds ­­ exceeds the

14

Federal government's constitutional authority.

15

never held that a provision implementing a ratified

16

treaty exceeds the Federal government's constitutional

17

authority.

18
19

It said in dictum.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has

It's

So your answer is if ­­ if

that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.
All right.
My answer is this:

That

23

the Court has said that there is an inquiry into whether

24

the ­­ it is a proper subject of a treaty and that that

25

inquiry could take into account whether it is imposing a

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

fundamental change in the character of the government.
But that's not a question the Court needs to

3

answer here because this treaty, the ­­ the Petitioner

4

concedes, is a valid exercise of the treaty power, and

5

the legislation implementing this treaty is coextensive

6

with the obligations of the treaty.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There is no ­­
Well, I don't know

8

why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty

9

power.

A case like Medellin caused serious conflict

10

with our international obligations because we held,

11

look, the Federal government does not have the authority

12

to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do.

13

great deal of strain in ­­ in our international

14

relations.

15

That caused a

And I think the United Nations could well

16

say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal

17

with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in

18

that province who has the authority, so every signatory

19

must have the authority.

20

reasonably related to international obligations.

21

It doesn't strike me as not

GENERAL VERRILLI:

All right.

But ­­ but

22

here, Mr. Chief Justice, this is a valid exercise of the

23

treaty power, and there is no daylight between the

24

implementing legislation and the obligations that the

25

Petitioner concedes are valid.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I know

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And therefore ­­ and

4

therefore, that may be a question that the Court would

5

have to answer in a different case.

6

doesn't present the opportunity to answer that question.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this case

So the ­­ the

8

purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if

9

there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or

10

intrusion by the Federal government on the police power

11

could be a constraint against an international treaty.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There ­­ there may be an

13

outer bound, but this case is nowhere close to it.

14

And ­­ and it isn't ­­ it can't be a "too local"

15

exception to the treaty power, which Petitioners argue.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems to me

17

that if you say there may be an outer bound, but this

18

case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to

19

the same criticisms that have been leveled against the

20

other side, that you're proposing a case­by­case

21

evaluation with respect to each treaty.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

I think, Your Honor,

23

that the question here is whether this legislation

24

validly ­­ it validly implements a valid treaty.

25

The treaty is concededly valid.

31
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

legislation is concededly valid on its face.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'd like to ­­ I'd like to

3

explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight

between the treaty itself and the implementing

5

legislation.

daylight between the two.

dragging the Congress into ­­ into areas where it has

3

never been before.

4

I think there is daylight between the treaty

5

and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the

6

fashion that ­­ that you assert is necessary here.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Your Honor, I'd like to

8

make a structural point and then a specific point about

9

this case.

The structural point, Justice Scalia, is

10

this:

11

hypothetical seems to concede and as I believe

12

Petitioner concedes, that a self­executing treaty that

13

requires the President to negotiate and two­thirds of

14

the Senate to ratify it, can impose an obligation of

15

that kind, then it has to be the case that a

16

non­self­executing treaty that is ­­ that has the same

17

approval of the President, the same two­thirds

18

ratification, and the additional structural protection

19

of passage of legislation by the Senate and the House

20

and being signed into law by the President, can do what

21

the self­executing treaty can do.

22

case.

If it is the case, as ­­ as Your Honor's

23

The power, if the ­­

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

the case.

It has to be the

I don't think it has to be

I think there ­­ there's a great difference

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between requiring the states, by a self­executing

2

treaty, to permit same­sex marriage and dragging the

3

Federal government or allowing the Federal government to

4

enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce,

5

adoption, family law, where the Federal government has

6

never been.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, with respect ­­

8

now, the point, with respect to this treaty, I don't

9

think that, with all due respect, there is any daylight

10
11

here with respect to this treaty.
Section 229(a) does precisely what the

12

treaty obligates the United States government to do, and

13

I think the notion that the treaty obligation can be

14

satisfied by relying on the States to enforce their

15

assault laws, which I think is the core of my friend's

16

argument here, is directly contrary to the history of

17

the framing ­­

State power make a treaty beyond the power of the

23

24

question.

25

But I'm not there yet.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

It's a very big

And the reason I'm

Official

1

not there is because there's some words in this treaty

2

called "other peaceful purpose," and we have to

3

interpret those words, and the same words are in the

4

statute.

5

And my question to you is:

What reason is

6

there to think that those matters on List A fall within

7

those words?

8

few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a

9

great case on attempted murder where he talks about

What is List A?

It's infinitely long.

10

11

candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn

12

after a few hours.

A

13
14
15

The kerosene is a chemical.

He talks about a case where a person went to
a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato.
He talks about a case involving somebody

16

else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and

17

setting fire to a haystack.

18

We can all think, sadly, of athletes, Lance

19

Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs.

20

I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within

21

those words, outside the words "other peaceful purpose,"

22

even though they're unlawful?

23

And by the way, did anyone say to the

24

drafters of the convention ­­ I found nothing in this

25

brief on the point ­­ or did anyone tell Congress that

35

And the

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.

11

Thank you, General.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few points in rebuttal.
First of all, the Senate's role in the

12

ratification of treaties cannot be a sufficient

13

political check, and one reason is that, sometimes, the

14

precise role they play as a check is to make a treaty

15

non­self­executing.

16

And so, to take Justice Scalia's

17

hypothetical example of an international treaty that

18

purported to regulate marriage rights, one thing that

19

the Senate very well might do in that case is to say,

20

well, we will ratify it, but we're going to make sure

21

it's non­self­executing, and maybe we will use our

22

spending power or something to get the States on board,

23

but we are not just going to impose a national solution.

24
25

So it doesn't make any sense to say that a
non­self­executing treaty necessarily, even if it's

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

valid, guarantees the validity of the enacting

2

legislation, because some of the reason that you make a

3

treaty non­self­executing is to preserve federalism.

4

A second point is to respond to the

5

argument, which I think I've already explained why it's

6

not correct, but it is the suggestion that there is no

7

daylight between the convention and the statute.

8

is huge daylight, and the daylight is precisely whether

9

it affects individual conduct and how it affects

10
11

There

individual conduct.
With all respect, everything on

12

Justice Breyer's List A is not stuff that I think

13

implicates the convention at all.

14

government's unwavering theory that you can't make any

15

limitations on the statute, that's all covered by the

16

statute.

17

But, yet, under the

There's your daylight.

Now, I would respectfully suggest that our

18

statutory construction argument is one way out of this.

19

I think that you have to understand the way that

20

"peaceful" is used in the statute is, essentially, a

21

term of art. I would analogize it to a situation where

22

two scientists in Antarctica get in a fistfight.

23

Okay.

That's not conduct we would condone,

24

but I don't think we've violated our pledge to reserve

25

Antarctica for only peaceful purposes.

55
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's the

Official

1

same way we would like you to interpret this statute.

2

Now, the government says you can't do that

3

because that's going to mess up what's going on in

4

Syria.

5

Syria is whether or not the nation state of Syria is

6

doing something that would violate the convention if,

7

contrary to fact, they were signatory to this

8

convention.

9

With all due respect, I assume that the issue in

So if you want to make clear that you're

10

only talking about individual conduct, I think you can

11

solve that whole problem right there.

12

and the only way, as the government assures you that you

13

can make this legislation work is to have it be an

14

exercise of the police power, well, then the answer is

15

that the legislation is simply unconstitutional.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I'm wrong

Can I just ask you,

17

Mr. Clement, and it's a variant of the hypothetical I

18

gave you before, but it focuses more on your statutory

19

point, the peaceful purposes.

20

Suppose that Ms. Bond used Sarin gas and

21

sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you

22

say that that's a peaceful purpose?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

I would say it's not, but I

24

think it has to do more with the particular qualities of

25

Sarin gas, the fact that it's on Schedule A, the fact

56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that nobody can possess that for any lawful use.

2

And what makes something like vinegar or

3

even potassium dichromate different is what puts it over

4

the ledge from being an ordinary chemical to a chemical

5

weapon is precisely its use and its use alone.

6

Now, Justice Kagan, you asked a great

7

question.

8

this?

9

focused on this issue at all.

10

What was Congress thinking when they did

I think, with respect, the Congress wasn't

If you look at the legislation they passed

11

to implement this, the chemical industry and others put

12

in front of them the possibility that there was a Fourth

13

Amendment problem with the inspections of chemical

14

production facilities that were authorized under the

15

convention.

16

problem in front of it, they had all sorts of provisions

17

to deal with that constitutional concern.

18

When Congress had the constitutional

Now, the future Ms. Bonds of the world

19

didn't have quite the same lobbying resources as the

20

chemist ­­ the chemical industry, so they didn't avert

21

to this problem.

22

clear statement rule or the like would make perfect

23

sense in this, to make sure Congress doesn't exercise

24

the police power, when all it thinks it's doing is

25

implementing a treaty.

And that's precisely why some kind of
