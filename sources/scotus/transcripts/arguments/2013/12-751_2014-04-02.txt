THE COURT:

We'll hear argument this morning

in Case 12­751, Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer.
Mr. Long.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

A fiduciary's decision to do exactly what an

11

employee stock ownership plan is designed to do and what

12

the plan requires by continuing to offer employer stock

13

as an investment option is presumptively prudent.

14

Statutory language, trust law, congressional policy, and

15

practical considerations all support this result.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You ­­ you want us to say

17

that we have sort of a coach class trustee.

18

traveling in coach class when we have an ESOP.

19

once we go down that road, how ­­ how do we define what

20

the duties of the trustee are?

We're all
Once ­­

21

MR. LONG:

22

coach class trustee.

23

look at the statutory definition of the duty of prudence

24

in Section 1104(a)(1)(b), which says that the duty of

25

prudence must take into account the character and aims

3

It is designed, the definition ­­

4

So when we talk about ESOPs, we're

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This does ­­ this plan

didn't require you to invest solely in employer stock,

6

did it?

7

MR. LONG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

This plan ­­
It gave you the option

to do it and to go above the 10 percent.

But it didn't

require you to buy only employer stock, did it?
MR. LONG:

Well ­­ well, ERISA, the statute,

12

requires that an ESOP invest primarily in employer's

13

stock.

14

that all of the assets in the ESOP be invested in

15

employer stock except the amount that needs to be in

16

cash for short­term management requirements.

17

Congress both ­­

18

This particular plan, like many plans, requires

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So ­­ so

Could you point to the

19

part of your plan that did that?

20

and I didn't see the plan requiring 100 percent

21

investment.

22

MR. LONG:

Because I looked at it

If ­­ Your Honor, if you look at

23

page 735 of the Joint Appendix, you'll find in ­­ in

24

part 3.3, it states, "However, in all events, the Fifth

25

Third stock fund as described shall be an investment

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

option."
And then if you look on 736 and then

3

continuing on to 737, it says that, "The funds shall be

4

invested primarily in Fifth Third stock."

5

may also be invested in short­term liquid investments to

6

the extent the administrator determines they are

7

desirable to accommodate expected short run liquidity

8

needs."

9

It says, "It

But then it says, "The trustee shall have no

10

discretionary authority to sell Fifth Third Bancorp

11

shares or refrain from acquiring additional Fifth Third

12

Bancorp shares with funds not held for short run

13

liquidity needs."

14

So we think that ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You use the word

16

"primarily."

17

have stopped buying stock once you understood that there

18

was a serious condition in the company.

19

breached your duty of loyalty, not of prudence.

20

you do with that allegation?

21

There's an allegation here that you should

MR. LONG:

That you've
What do

Well, what we say is that these

22

duties ­­ again, we're not asking for coach class

23

duties.

24

they have to be understood in the context of this

25

special kind of plan with special purposes.

These are first class, if you will, duties, but

5
Alderson Reporting Company

The ­­ the

Official

1

purpose of an ESOP is to own company stock, to give the

2

employees a piece of the rock, an ownership interest in

3

the company.

4

you're ­­ as you're posing it, Justice Sotomayor, at

5

what point does a duty of prudence or a duty of loyalty,

6

either one, require the trustee to break the plans of

7

the term, deviate from the plan's ­­

9
10

And so when ­­ when the issue is, as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
to.

It says "primarily."

It doesn't say you have
It doesn't say you have to

continue buying.

11

MR. LONG:

12

quoted the language.

13

the government agrees with us on this, the ­­ the

14

instructions of the plan are to invest all the money in

15

Fifth Third stock except as needed for short­term cash

16

requirements.

17

Well, again, I mean, I ­­ I
As we read the plan, and I think

Now, there is the duty of prudence, and

18

we're not asking for a second class duty.

19

in this context, given this special kind of plan, what

20

that duty means is can the purpose of this ­­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we think

Mr. Long, there is no

22

presumption written into this statute.

23

exception from the diversification requirements in ESOP.

24

The whole object is to buy the company's stock, and so

25

you don't need to diversify.

There is an

But apart from that, the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statutory requirement on loyalty and prudence is

2

undiluted.

3

comes from.

4

And so I don't know where this presumption
It's not in the statute itself.

MR. LONG:

Well ­­ well, we do think it

5

comes from the text of the statute.

6

duty of prudence itself which looks to the character and

7

aims of the plan, and then in Section 1107(d)(6), an

8

ESOP is defined in ERISA to be a plan that's designed to

9

invest primarily in the employer's own stock.

It comes from the

So we

10

think that defines the special character name of the

plans.

Congress has also spoken to this in other

Mr. Long, I think it ­­

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Section 1104 of ERISA,

15

which this ­­ this plan is not exempted from, says that

the fiduciaries must manage a plan, and I quote, "for

17

the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to

18

participants and their beneficiaries."

19

acknowledge that that's binding on the ­­

MR. LONG:

It ­­ it is.

And the government

21

adds the word "retirement" before benefits, and they say

22

an ESOP must be managed exclusively to provide

23

retirement benefits, but that ­­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't add that.

I'm just saying providing benefits.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, that's ­­

Official

that's ­­

2

MR. LONG:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, yes.
­­ that's quite different

4

from running a plan to ­­ to own stock in the company.

5

That's ­­ that's not the basic purpose of it.

6

MR. LONG:

Well, ­­ well, but,

7

Justice Scalia, plans ­­ ERISA plans provide different

8

kinds of benefits.

9

provide death benefits, hardship benefits, disability

The pension plans themselves can

11

piece of the rock, you know, the duty of the fiduciary

12

is to manage that as best as it can be managed to

13

produce the largest benefit for the participants.

14

it's ­­ but it's not ­­ to go back to your question to

15

say, well, you know, it looks like some other investment

16

would be a better investment this week or this month.

17

So if the benefit is stock in the company, a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Is there anything in the

18

trust law or the common law that allows us to define

19

benefits that way?

20

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, I don't think we're

21

asking for a special definition of benefits.

22

saying that what this plan ­­ and trust law does say the

23

settlor has a great deal of leeway to define the ­­ the

24

benefits that are being provided.

25

kind of benefit, though, that Congress not only

8
Alderson Reporting Company

We're just

This is a particular

Official

1

authorized, but has strongly encouraged.

2

employers are strongly encouraged to offer this benefit.

3

I mean,

So to say that prudence or loyalty or ­­ or

4

any of these fiduciary duties requires a sort of

5

continuous monitoring of the company to see whether ­­

6

this is no longer such a good investment.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say the benefits

8

referred to in the ­­ providing benefits to

9

participants, and you're saying the benefits to

10

participants is their ownership of company stock,

11

including worthless company stock.

12

MR. LONG:

Well ­­ well, no, not at all,

13

Justice Scalia.

I mean, the ­­ the idea is that the

14

company stock is valuable, and the hope is ­­

15
16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But when it ceases to be

valuable, it seems to me you're not.
MR. LONG:

Well, and ­­ and we agree as ­­

18

as every court of appeals has ­­ has held, that has

19

looked at this, all seven, that there ­­ there does come

20

a time when the purpose of the ESOP, of allowing the

21

employees to build an ownership stake in the company,

22

can no longer be realized because the company is in

23

serious peril, serious jeopardy.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ but there are

occasions, Mr. Long, outside of that very narrow

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

category of cases that you define in which the stock is

2

going to be way, way, way, overvalued relative to what

3

the fiduciaries know is the company's actual value.

4

Let's just say it ­­ the ­­ the market price is four

5

times more than the actual value, and the fiduciaries

6

know that because of inside information that they have.

7

It just sort of defies language to say that some ­­ a

8

prudent person would retain the investment in that kind

9

of wildly overvalued stock, doesn't it?

10

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, if I could take

11

that in several steps.

12

overvaluation standard, which no court has ever

13

accepted, we think, is unworkable.

14

all, before you get to the inside information, which I

15

think is the kernel of it that's left at the end, if you

16

have a stock that is traded on an active market, you

17

really can't tell the fiduciary, absent possibly inside

18

information, Well, you need to outsmart the market.

19

I mean, that material

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

I mean, first of

But I'm talking about a

20

case in which the fiduciary has inside information

21

that ­­ that ­­ that enables him to know that the stock

22

price is way overvaluing the actual value of the

23

company.

24
25

MR. LONG:

But when you ­­ when you get to

that point of the analysis, and this is what all the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts have recognized, you have to then bring in

2

securities law, and you have to recognize to trade on

3

that inside information would violate securities law.

4

So prudence or loyalty cannot require a violation of

5

securities law.

6

So what ­­ what are the other options?

You

could halt trading.

shutting down the ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I ­­ I suppose it

13

could, but a prudent manager might say that it would do

14

greater damage to the ­­ to the participants in the plan

15

to enable this misinformation to exist and to keep

16

putting ­­ to keep buying stock, to keep putting more

17

and more of their retirement investments into something

18

that is really overvalued.

19

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, our point is that

20

that public announcement, that the ESOP has stopped

21

allowing purchases of company stock, could cause a sort

22

of collapse in the stock price that would be terrible

23

for the participants, and saying that prudence requires

24

that is kind of risky gamble.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you assume that

truthful information will out in the end, and is it

2

better to keep on putting more money into something that

3

is ­­ is ­­ you know, is really not a good investment

4

for the participants and the beneficiaries?

5

MR. LONG:

Well, but ­­ but by ­­ you know,

6

stopping immediately you could cause even greater harm.

7

But let ­­ I think your initial question ­­

following the law and disclosing that material

information to the public and stopping the ­­ the

11

employees from losing more money in worthless stock ­­

12

MR. LONG:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

stock?

15

MR. LONG:

government comes in.

17

from let's, you know, shut down the ESOP to let's

18

release information.

That's ultimately where the
Now, we've moved a huge distance

19

But there we would say, again, we think you

20

have to consider this in connection with securities law

21

that if ­­ if you announce, well, there's this sort of

22

general duty to release information ­­ I mean, first of

23

all, that would be quite a big change in ERISA.

There's ­­ there are many specific requirements for

disclosure of information in ERISA.

So this ­­ this happens quite a lot.

You know, second of all, this ­­ this idea

not really solve all the problems because then you'd

have to have a monitoring trustee who would have to give

2

information that should be disclosed because it affects

3

the stock price, then it's going to hurt not only the

4

company, but also your retirement stock.

5

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, first of all, it's

6

quite right that an ESOP, because it's totally

7

undiversified, is not by itself a good retirement plan.

8

And we think that just confirms that the ­­ the special

saying is using public information, the chances that the

company is going to be able to provide employee

But I do ­­ I do want to answer your

question on inside information because I think that's

It ­­ that's another way of getting to the ­­ the bottom

define the standard or the duty that's responsive to

Justice Alito's concern?

Let's assume that trustees in a non­ESOPs

investments.

I

Well, I mean, the courts of

appeals have had a fairly uniform approach to this for

17

now almost 20 years, and it has ­­ it has not been

18

causing a great deal of ­­ of trouble.

19

they've all been taking is that because of the special

20

nature of ESOPs and, you know, when the plan requires

21

that all the funds be invested in the ESOP at least,

22

that's what the fiduciary must do, and that is

presumptively prudent.

Mr. Mann, I think it would help if you

MR. MANN:

Section 1002, Sub 3 describes

4

employee benefit plans, which are the subject of ERISA.

5

And there are two types of employee benefit plans as

6

defined in that section.

7

welfare benefits and plans that provide pension

benefits.

I think that the best way to think about
this is, essentially, what the petitioners are saying

is, if I decide to put myself in a position where I owe

2

duties to two different people, my employer on the one

quite parallel to the situation that corporate directors

face when they come into a conflicted situation.

me you are living in something of a different world.

I think that's right.

why we believe that this standard of prudence is

you can't look at the statute without thinking that

about the statute.

16

Scalia made that Section 404(a)(2) specifically carves

17

out some duties but not others.

18

It's not only the point that Justice

It's also that it only forgives prudence to

19

the extent of diversification, which means that prudence

20

has to mean something other than diversification.

21

then it still further limits the scope of forgiveness.

22

It only forgives it with respect to the acquisition or

23

holding of qualifying employee securities ­­ employer

First of all,

in response to Justice Breyer's question about inside

25

knowledge about a corporation's stock's value, that is a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LONG:

The ESOP association brief

reports at page 2 that there are $1.07 trillion in these

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employee stock plans, and we think really that's the

2

key, are all of the Courts of Appeals considering many

3

cases, you know, with many different fact patterns have

4

not disagreed.

5

that we've spent all our time discussing this morning.

6

The only circuit split is on whether this presumption

7

applies at the motion to dismiss stage.

There is no circuit split on the issue

8

The real point here, as ­­ as Justice

9

Kennedy said, Congress strongly supports ESOPs.

10
11

It

wants to encourage them so it ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I appreciate that.

12

But if I'm listening to the government carefully and

13

understanding its position, it's basically saying if

14

there's been a violation of a securities law that a

15

fiduciary knows, then why shouldn't it be liable both

16

under the company, under 10b­5, and the director of the

17

plan or the trustee of the plan as a breach of loyalty

18

to ­­ or ­­ or of prudence to the beneficiaries?

19

MR. LONG:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

these circumstances, I mean, in terms of ­­

MR. LONG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but ­­
But I think your

4

adversary was saying that's a self­induced problem, not

5

one that the law should excuse you from following

6

whatever the law is.

7

MR. LONG:

Well, but ­­ but two points.

I

8

mean, you ­­ I would submit you should be very cautious

9

about interpreting these duties in ways that will make

10

ESOPs unworkable, and I think that would basically cause

11

many companies to say we can't put fiduciaries in that

12

situation, so we're not going to have ESOPs at all.

13

And the ­­ you know, again, because the

14

special purpose of an ESOP is to give the employees a

15

piece of the rock, ownership in the company, if the

16

company is going through temporary hard times, even if

17

there's a situation where there's some, you know,

18

material misinformation that is out in the market, that

19

may all be corrected in the long term.

20

this case, if the fiduciaries had shut down the ESOP,

21

they would certainly have been sued because they would

22

have violated the plan terms, and the ­­ the plan has

23

done very well.

24
25

You know, in

It's gone up from $2 to over $22.

So they might have had a very hard time
winning that case because they would have been

56
Alderson Reporting Company

challenged that prudence didn't really require you to

2

shut it down.

3

problems, but we came through them.

4

That's the razor's edge.

Yes, we were going through some severe

That's the rock

5

and the hard place.

6

recognize this presumption that every court of appeals

7

has recognized to give the ESOP fiduciary some leeway.

8

They're going to be different from any other fiduciary

9

in any other plan because it's the company's stock.

10

They're going to be sued unless you

And if they, you know ­­ if ­­ if the stock

11

goes down under this open­ended duty of prudence,

12

they're going to be sued for not having anticipated that

13

and done something, sold, stopped trading, put out

14

information.

15

up, they're going to be sued for that.

But if they don't do it and the stock goes

16

And, in fact, you know, if you recognize the

17

government's approach, there'll be a whole new class of

18

cases, which is, if the stock goes up, their ­­

19

plaintiffs' lawyers will be able to argue, well, the

20

fiduciary should have ­­ should have anticipated that,

21

and the participants who were selling and deciding to

22

move over to the S&P 500 fund, you let them sell their

23

stock too cheaply, and that's a violation.

24

it's unworkable.
