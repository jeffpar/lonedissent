CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

now in Case 12­930, Mayorkas v. Cuellar de Osorio.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

9

The Board of Immigration Appeals reasonably

10

interpreted Section 1153(h)(3) when it ruled that

11

creation of a new petition by a new petitioner did not

12

qualify as automatic conversion of an existing petition

13

to an appropriate family­sponsored category.

14

interpretation is supported by the text and by the

15

structure of the statutory scheme.

16

That

Indeed, it avoids destabilizing that scheme

17

by displacing waiting aliens, who have long had

18

qualifying relationships with lawful permanent

19

residence, and putting ahead of them in line a large

20

number of adults, aged­out former derivative

21

beneficiaries, who have only just attained a

22

relationship with someone who can sponsor a family

23

member.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't there ­­ isn't

the effect on the no longer child much more severe?

3
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

mean, if everybody has to get bumped down a little way,

2

it'll make a difference of months until they qualify for

3

a hearing.

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Your Honor, I don't accept

5

the proposition that it would only make a difference of

6

months, although I know Respondents have argued that.

7

It depends how many people ­­

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

be 27 years.

10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Well, it's not going to

I'm sorry?
It's not going to be 20

years.

13

MS. GOLDENBERG:

No, Your Honor.

It won't

14

be 20 years, but it could be years, and these people in

15

the F2B line have already been waiting for years to get

16

up to the front of that line.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about all the time

18

this one child has been waiting?

19

that?

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It gets no credit for

I think it's mistaken to

21

think of a derivative beneficiary as waiting in line and

22

being entitled to credit for waiting in line, for a

23

couple of different reasons.

24
25

First of all, the derivative's rights are,
as the name suggests, completely derivative of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principal beneficiary's rights.

2

beneficiary never becomes a lawful permanent resident,

3

never crosses the border into this country, then the

4

derivative gets nothing for the time that the principal

5

beneficiary spent waiting in line.

6

If the principal

In addition, there are derivative

7

beneficiaries who, under any understanding of what it

8

means to wait in line, can't be conceived of as having

9

waited ­­ excuse me ­­ for the time that the principal

10

beneficiary has waited.

11

of that.

12

And let me give you an example

In the F4 line, someone could be waiting in

13

the F4 line as a principal beneficiary for, say, 15

14

years, and right as they're getting up to the front of

15

that line ­­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's

18

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I'm sorry.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For those of us who don't

17

22

F4?

What's

F4?

deal with this as much as you do.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

I apologize, Your Honor.

F4 is siblings of U.S. citizens.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

24

MS. GOLDENBERG:

So they could be waiting in

25

the F4 line for 15 years, let's say, as a principal

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

beneficiary; and then just as they get ­­ they're

2

getting up to the front of that line and their priority

3

date is going to become current, they get married to

4

somebody; and the person they get married to has a

5

17­year­old child at that point in time.

6

That stepchild, that 17­year­old child,

7

under the definition of child in the statute, will count

8

as the principal beneficiary's child.

9

year later, the principal beneficiary's priority date

And if, say, a

10

becomes current and that principal beneficiary is

11

entitled to immigrate to the United States and become a

12

lawful permanent resident, they're going to be able to

13

bring that 17­year­old ­­ or, at that point, 18­year­old

14

stepchild along with them as a derivative beneficiary.

15

That stepchild did not wait in the line for

16

the first 15 years that the principal beneficiary was

17

waiting.

18

you look at a derivative beneficiary, you want to look

19

at the end of the process, a snapshot in time of when

20

the principal beneficiary is coming to this country.

21

And so that example, I think, shows why, when

And what the statute says is, principal

22

beneficiary, if ­­ at the moment you're coming, do you

23

have a child who would be left behind in another country

24

if you were to come without them, if so, bring them

25

along.

But it doesn't make sense to look at a

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

derivative beneficiary ­­

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

to include immediate?

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

So you interpret automatic

Well, I think that if ­­ if

5

automatically converted, in the context of this statute,

6

if that's triggered by a particular event, then it has

7

to happen as a result of that event, yes.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your reading of this

statute gives (h)(3) a very, very narrow scope; isn't

10

that correct?

11

exactly how narrow it is.

12

all, does it apply to any employment­based or

13

diversity­based petitions?

14

MS. GOLDENBERG:

15
16

And I just want to see if I understand
It would apply ­­ first of

No, Your Honor, it does

not.
JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

It applies to an

17

F2A petition filed by a legal permanent resident on

18

behalf of that person's spouse; right?

19

that ­­ if they have a minor child, then the minor child

20

would be a derivative.

21

MS. GOLDENBERG:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. GOLDENBERG:

And ­­ and if

Right.

Yes.

It also would apply

24

to a situation where an F2A petition is filed for a

25

child as the principal beneficiary, and the child ages

Alderson Reporting Company

1

out of that status.

2

doesn't actually apply to all aged­out F2A derivative

3

beneficiaries, so it's, perhaps, even slightly narrower

4

than Your Honor has described.

5

But I'd also like to say that it

It applies to situations where

there can be

automatic conversion of the existing petition and

7

movement into a new appropriate category without a

change in the petitioner.

Now, that ­­ that's the kind of argument that

13

you're up against, I think, so I wanted to ask you that

14

empirical question.

15

16

If you can give me any idea of the

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well,

17

before I get to the question of the numbers, and I can

18

give you some numbers, although not perfect numbers,

19

because of how records are kept in this area.

20

like to say that, keep in mind, that what Congress was

21

reasonably interpreted to be doing here is picking up on

22

an existing regulation that was targeted specifically at

23

this very group that we're talking about.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'd just

I'm going to let you

answer his question, but, yes, they had a regulation, so

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why didn't they copy the regulation?

2

MS. GOLDENBERG:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
It would have been much,

4

much simpler to say this is limited to F2A beneficiaries

5

than to write it the way they did and say this is to

6

everybody who ages out.

7

10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

There are two reasons, I

think, why they didn't copy the ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Answer him, and then ­­

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Okay.

With respect to the

11

numbers on our ­­ in our reply brief, on page 18, in the

12

footnote, we've given the best numbers that we were able

13

to come up with, and they are not complete numbers,

14

about people who are aging out every year, for as long

15

as the State Department's been keeping records about

16

this, which is not all that long.

17

there's a series of parentheticals there, with respect

18

to each year.

19

And you can see that

The first number in the parenthetical

20

represents age­out derivatives ­­ derivatives in the F2A

21

category; and the second number represents aged­out

22

derivatives in all family preference categories,

23

including F2A.

24

are not tiny; there are thousands of people a year.

25

some years, they are up in the 20 thousands.

5

aging out.

6

thing is if we can get some idea, which seems in the

7

paper, that your interpretation applies to ­­ only to a

subset of those people.

9

That's the 2,000, 3,000, sometimes 10,000
All right.

But ­­ but the real relevant

And just from reading it, that it's

12

for you or against you.

13

nonetheless ­­

14

16

Now, we can argue about whether that's
I think it's against you, but

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You do give the subsets.

It's not just the general, is it?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes.

There's ­­ I was

going to say, the first number is the F2A ­­ the

18

aged­out F2A derivatives.

JUSTICE BREYER:

relevant.
JUSTICE BREYER:

F2A.

You're right.

MS. GOLDENBERG:

That's what's covered.

this is not a full universe of the numbers.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

We tried to

So it looks

10

like it's between 10 percent, and sometimes, it gets it

11

up to 30 percent ­­

12

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It varies, Your Honor.

And

13

as I say, these numbers aren't perfect, but I think it

14

gives you a sense of the universe that we're talking

15

about here, to the best of our ability.

16

So if I could turn back to Justice

17

Sotomayor's question about why they didn't just go ahead

18

and copy the language of the regulation into the statute

19

and why they didn't just say F2A in the statute?

20

think the reason gets back to what I was discussing

21

earlier, actually, with Justice Alito, which is that

22

actually would have been overinclusive, if they had just

23

said F2A beneficiaries are covered, because there is a

24

set of F2A derivative beneficiaries who don't benefit

25

from the language of Section 1153(h)(3), because they

12
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

are the child of the petitioner's spouse, but they don't

2

count as the child of the petitioner, probably for a

3

stepchild kind of situation, like I was discussing

4

earlier.

5

marriage, they don't count as a stepparent's child under

6

the statute.

7

If the stepchild is over 18 at the time of the

So there is a tiny corner, here, that would

8

get carved out.

9

job in this statute of capturing exactly the universe of

And actually, Congress did a very good

10

people that was captured under the preexisting

11

regulation.

12

to be another petition filed by the same petitioner, and

13

automatic conversion to the appropriate category gets at

14

exactly that same kind of result.

15

The preexisting regulation required there

The other reason I think why Congress might

16

not have specified F2A in Section 1153(h)(3), in

17

addition to just its understanding of automatic

18

conversion as a term of art in this area that was doing

19

the work that it wanted, is that Section 1153(h)(3) now

20

functions smoothly, if there's a change in the

21

family­sponsored categories, which has happened in the

22

past.

23

Congress has changed up those categories,

24

added categories.

25

were now to add a category for grandchildren of U.S.

And so if, for instance, Congress

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

citizens, then aged­out F3 beneficiaries, like

2

Respondents' sons and daughters, could automatically

3

convert to an appropriate category and Section

4

1153(h)(3) would work just fine.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose there are two ­­

6

suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are

7

exactly the same, except that one has a minor child and

8

one has an adult unmarried child.

9

So the latter files an F2B petition and gets

10

in line on a particular date, right?

11

the lawful permanent resident, who has an unmarried ­­

12

who has a minor child, files an F2A petition and gets in

13

that line.

14

Then the former,

But then by the time the date comes up, the

15

child has aged out, and so, now, you would say that

16

would be converted to an F2B petition.

17

MS. GOLDENBERG:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.
But the person would be ­­

19

the child would be at a much lower point, right, than

20

the first one?

21

Why would Congress have wanted that?

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I don't think that's

22

necessarily true.

23

dates were working between when they were coming current

24

in the different categories.

25

the aged­out F2A individual would go into the middle or

It would depend on how the priority

I do think it's true that

the back of the F2B line, the way that the priority

2

dates are currently working out.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, but they would ­­

6

yes, I suppose that's true, but the person who ages out

would be keeping the original priority date, so they're

8

not entitled to more than that.

might have wanted to put people into the middle or back

critically important here ­­

Thank

And I would like to spend a few

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Goldenberg, before you

20

do that, could I just ask you to respond to a sort of

21

different hypothesis of what Congress was up to here and

22

tell me what, if anything, you think follows from it?

23

Assume you think that Congress actually was

24

not intending this very small category, that Congress

25

was intending for this to be a pretty wide provision,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but what Congress was ­­ it was laboring under a

2

misapprehension.

3

this kind of automatic conversion with respect to all of

4

these people, and it turns out Congress was just utterly

5

wrong on that.

6

I mean, it thought that you could do

So ­­ but Congress includes this language

7

about automatic conversion.

8

basically have a hunch that that's what Congress was

9

thinking, but, yet, the language that it adopted talks

So what do I do if I

10

about automatic conversion, which is impossible for many

11

of this category.

12

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Right.

I think it's the

13

language that's on the face of the statute that's

14

important, and it's ambiguous for the very reason that

15

you just gave, which is that there are a lot of people

16

for whom automatic conversion to the appropriate

17

category just isn't going to work.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you mean we can't

correct congressional mistakes?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

No, but I think, in a

21

situation where the language is ambiguous, the Agency is

22

entitled to deference, and deference is particularly

23

appropriate in this kind of circumstance.

24

has said, before, that deference is particularly

25

appropriate in immigration contexts, and I think, if any

16
Alderson Reporting Company

This Court

Official

1

immigration context is appropriate for it, it's this one

2

because very delicate lines have to be drawn here.

3

If someone is helped, someone else is hurt.

4

And it's something where you have to step very

5

carefully.

6

destabilization of the system.

7

Otherwise, there is going to be real

And just before I turn to that, let me just

8

say one more thing about what Congress was thinking.

9

the extent that you look at the legislative history

To

10

here, there is no indication that Congress was thinking

11

that this would sweep broadly.

12

statements on the floor about not wanting to displace

13

people who are waiting in line, which would cut in the

14

other direction.

15

In fact, there are many

So the destabilization that would occur as a

16

result of Respondents' interpretation would be many

17

people ­­ and we can't quantify exactly how many, but we

18

have reason to think that the number is quite large ­­

19

would come pouring into, in most cases, the very front

20

of the F2B line and would hold it up for very

21

significant periods of time and perhaps even freeze that

22

line altogether.

23

Keep in mind that, in that line, there are

24

only 26,250 visas available per year ­­ nothing changes

25

that ­­ and per country, there are only about 1,800

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

visas available per year.

2

3,600 people from one country coming into the front of

3

the F2B line, every single person in that line ­­ that's

4

at least hundreds of thousands of people, based on State

5

Department numbers, and more than that probably, if you

6

had the other numbers, is going to wait for two

7

additional years.

8

into the front of the line, all those people are going

9

to wait longer.

So if you envision, say,

And if there are more people who come

10

And the equities here are such that the

11

people who are going to be pushed back really have

12

entitlement to stay where they are, and that's for this

13

reason:

14

the aged­out F3 and F4 derivative beneficiaries, have

15

only just, just moments before this has happened,

16

obtained some kind of qualifying relationship with the

17

U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident that would

18

entitle them to family­sponsored immigration.

19

The people coming into the front of the line,

Prior to their parent, the principal

20

beneficiary, becoming a lawful permanent resident, they

21

were just the nieces, nephews, grandchildren, of

22

citizens and ­­

4

you can ever have automatic conversion to an appropriate

someone new as the petitioner.

One is the question of whether

So that's one issue.

11

MS. GOLDENBERG:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

But automatic just means

That's true.
So why isn't there ­­

why isn't it automatic here?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think that ­­ with

15

respect to the issue that I was just talking about,

16

which is the question of whether you can ever convert a

17

petition to ­­ make a petition by its ­­ something

18

that's by a new petitioner.

19

that is required. Do you have to go to the new

20

petitioner, the parent, and say, would you like to

21

petition?

22

There, there is some action

Do you have to check that person?

Now, keep in mind, they've never been

23

checked at the beginning of this process when petitions

24

are evaluated and approved, to see if they qualify to be

25

a petitioner.

For instance, to be a petitioner, you

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can't have committed certain crimes against minors.

2

that will never have happened here.

3

And

So if you have to stop and do that check, at

4

that stage as well, then it's starting to look a lot

5

less automatic.

6

say, even if you did think that the statute could

7

unambiguously be read to say that you can take a

8

petition by someone's grandparent and make it into a

9

petition by someone's parent, there's a separate timing

Then there's a separate question, as I

10

question that the parties are disputing here as well and

11

that the board ruled on in its decision in Wang, and

12

that is, what is the moment when automatic conversion is

13

supposed to take place?

14

Respondents' argument is that it's supposed

15

to take place at whatever time the derivative

16

beneficiary is interviewed, essentially at the very end

17

of the process, a consular interview or an adjustment of

18

status interview or evaluation, and that that's when

19

automatic conversion ought to happen.

20

But what the board said, and I think quite

21

recently, is something different, which is the statute

22

gives you a date ­­ Section 1153(h)(1) gives you a date

23

as of which you are supposed to evaluate the derivative

24

beneficiary's age.

25

And that's the date that the visa number

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

becomes available to a parent.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I understand that argument,

3

but that's not the argument that Wang made, is it?

4

suggested that if the ­­ the appropriate date was at the

5

very date of aging out, so ­­ so it seems as though you

6

shouldn't be entitled to Chevron deference on that

7

question, given what Wang said about it.

8
9

MS. GOLDENBERG:
Your Honor.

Wang

I don't think that's true,

I think, as I read Wang in any event, that

10

it says, on page 33, you get automatic conversion if the

11

beneficiary is 21 years or older pursuant to (h)(1), and

12

then later, in the decision on page 35, it talks about

13

the moment the beneficiary aged out.

14

But, that, I take it to be referring back to

15

the (h)(1) determination that's been made.

16

out, not biologically in the sense of turning 21 and

17

celebrating your 21st birthday, but becoming 21 ­­ over

18

21 ­­ 21 or over, under (h)(1), as of that date that the

19

visa number becomes available to the parent.

So it's aged

20

I think that's how Wang is best interpreted.

21

There may be separate questions about whether people are

22

entitled to the protections of (h)(1), but those aren't

23

being raised in this case, and that's not something that

24

Wang itself ruled on.

25

And so I do think that there's a reasonable

23
Alderson Reporting Company

reading of the statute that says ­­ getting back to the

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Congress added (h)(4) a

think, basically, just to ensure that battered women,

The government began at step 2 of Chevron,

but I would submit that this case can and should be

resolved at step 1.

5

to read the statute in a highly disfavored way, such

6

that it is not harmonious, but at war with itself, and

7

nothing in the language requires that.

recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the

forth.
And we can see that provision (h)(3)

12

consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of

two parts, separated by a comma.

inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a

5

gives to the statute.

So if there is a possible reading of

And Congress

15

Now, the government's claim of ambiguity

16

here depends on asking the Court to read one of the

17

benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such

18

a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the

19

plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not

20

adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad

21

scope set forth before the comma.

22

The Court should be very suspicious of that

23

reading because it is exactly the contrary of the

24

traditional tool of statutory construction going back to

25

Brown & Williamson and FTC v. Mandel that says the Court

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reads a statute holistically as a harmonious whole.

2

For the government's argument to work, the

3

Court would have to be satisfied that we were in a

4

situation like National Association of Home Builders v.

5

Defenders of Wildlife, which is the only case that they

6

cite for their ambiguity claim, but there, the Court

7

faced two different statutes and acted at different

8

times that were clearly contradictory.

9

You could not comply with both of them at

10

the same time.

12

to Agency interpretation.

adult to come in, much less go ahead without a petition

8

MR. FLEMING:

9

Well, a couple of points on

that, Justice Scalia.
First of all, if in the highly hypothetical

11

situation, that you have a parent who has immigrated and

12

does not want an aged­out child to come and join them in

13

the United States, then it is easy for the parent ­­ the

14

lawful permanent resident parent to withdraw a petition.

15

Also, the child cannot immigrate.

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You’re going to file a petition in

that person's name, without that person's consent?
MR. FLEMING:

Well, the immigration ­­ the

ultimate moment of immigration, when the child comes in,

20

cannot happen without the parent's consent.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. FLEMING:

The conversion can happen to a

4

petition in the F2B category, but in order for a visa

5

actually to be given and for the child to immigrate,

6

the ­­ first of all, the child would have to provide

7

proof the parent is, in fact, a permanent resident, and

8

would also have to provide an affidavit of support,

9

under a provision that the government cites in its reply

10

brief, agreeing to support the child, so that he or she

11

does not become a public charge.

Now, that could be adjudicated

10

in one of two ways, depending on whether the

12

Notably, if the beneficiaries are inside the

MR. FLEMING:

Well, I think, at that point,

10

the question then becomes, does the conversion have to

11

happen immediately at that time, or as long as it's

12

converted at some point in the future, are we still

13

interpreting the statute in a harmonious way?

14

automatically doesn't have to mean immediately.

15

Now, we think it can mean immediately, if

It

16

that's how the Court chooses to interpret it, and still

17

win, because we think the determination happens when the

18

adjudication happens, which is when, under their current

19

procedures, they do the age calculations.

20

But even if the Court disagrees with me on

21

that and thinks that the statute requires the

22

determination to happen sooner, all that means is, at

23

some point after the determination, the petition shall

24

be converted; but that doesn't mean it has to be done

25

right at the time of the determination.

I'd like to back up, though, and take on the

2

premise of the question, which is that (h)(1) somehow

3

says that the conversion in (h)(3) has to happen on the

4

date that the visa becomes available because that's not

5

what the statute says.

6

H(3) does not say that the conversion has to

7

happen on that date.

age of the derivative beneficiary for purposes of

that is reduced by the number in (b), which is the

And if you go through that calculation and

your petition shall automatically be converted to the

plenty of ways for the parent to stop the immigration of

One thing I would like to back up to, just

20

because we are at Chevron step 1, and one of the issues

21

that this Court indicated in Brown and Williamson is

important for that ­­ for that analysis, is a modicum of

23

common sense as to the manner in which Congress would

24

have been likely to delegate this particular question to

25

the Agency.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

The question here isn't some interstitial

2

matter or some filling of a gap that Congress is not

likely to have turned its mind to.

4

question, who gets the benefit of these mandates after

5

the comma, the automatic conversion and the retention of

6

priority dates.

7

It is a foundational

It's unlikely that Congress didn't think

8

about something as basic as that; and if they did mean

9

to delegate that to the Board of Immigration Appeals,

10

it's a very strange way of doing it because ­­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Based on ­­ another

understanding of Chevron is, sometimes, Congress writes

it.

23

MR. FLEMING:

The ­­ the Agency gets to do

I would certainly agree,

24

Justice Kagan, as a general matter, that the immigration

25

law is confusing, but I don't think it's any more

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

confusing than other statutes, where this Court worked

2

through and found the ­­ the ultimate provision at issue

3

to be clear on the question at issue.

And here, the question is who gets the

5

benefit of it?

undisputed in its meaning, that covers all derivative

conversion and retention priority date, that clearly can

9

be applied ­­ possibly, not only possibly, but easily ­­

And we have an opening clause that is

We also have benefits, automatic,

10

to the full scope set out in the clause before the

11

comma.

12

And we have an omission, presumably

13

deliberate, of specific limitations not only in the

14

regulations, but also in the V visa provision, which we

15

cite, which specifically call out the very group that

the government now is trying to favor.

If Congress had

It deliberately, presumably, chose not to do

that.

21

questioning earlier in the argument indicated, if all

22

that the Congress was trying to do here was codify an

23

existing regulation, it was very easy for them to say

24

so, but this is a ameliorative provision.

25

acknowledged that.

As the Fifth Circuit observed and as the

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Even the BIA

They were trying to solve a problem that

2

happened when people had been waiting for a long period

3

of time, and not just the beneficiary, but also the ­­

5

principal beneficiary.

6

I mean, the lead Respondent in this case,

Rosario Cuellar de Osorio, had been waiting a long time

8

to emigrate with her husband and her family, and then

when the time came, she was told, you can all go, except

10

Melvin; because he happened to turn 21 four months

11

before the visa number became available.

12

recognized that was a problem and tried to fix it.

13

they did fix it, clearly.

14

Congress
And

That is the common­sense reading of this

15

provision, that the clear language up front, before the

16

comma, sets out the scope, and that Congress meant the

17

remainder of the provision to be read consistently,

18

harmoniously, and holistically, as this Court has said

19

it always does, with that scope, not to read it in

20

tension ­­ in some kind of irretrievable hostility with

21

itself, which is the argument that the government needs

22

to convince this Court of in order to even get to step

23

2.

24

Now, of course, we do have an alternative

25

argument, with ­­ which is ­­ you know, independent,

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

even if this Court were to agree that our Respondents'

2

children are not entitled to automatic conversion,

3

although we think they clearly are, then, at the very

4

least, there is another way to read the statute

5

harmoniously, which is that they're entitled to the

6

retention of priority date.

7

that is provided by (h)(3).

8
9
10
11

That is the main benefit

It's the benefit that is mentioned in the
inactive title of the statute, and it's all that's
needed to affirm the judgment here.
And, again, remember the standard.

All

12

we ­­ all we need to show, for our purposes, to affirm

comma can be read in a way that is consistent with the

talking about here is a statute that the government is

19

trying to argue is hopelessly internally inconsistent.

20

That is a step 1 argument that we think gets rejected at

21

step 1 because the statute can be read holistically and

22

harmoniously.

23

And if there is any possible reading ­­ this

24

is the language of Brown and Williamson and FTC versus

reading to be given.

What ­­ what fundamentally

11

happens is that the ­­ the petition gets filed by the

12

U.S. citizen relative, and then, after it's approved,

13

just by basically checking that the relative is entitled

14

to file that petition, then everybody awaits until the

15

petition ­­ until the priority date of the ­­ of the

16

beneficiary becomes current, according to the State

17

Department lines.

18

It's not as though there's a constantly

19

re­updating, to see if anyone has aged out or anyone has

20

naturalized or anyone's gotten married or anything like

21

that.

22

If somebody wants to do that, then,

23

obviously, they can send something in.

24

though there is a continuous updating of the file, until

25

the time comes when a visa application is submitted.

53
Alderson Reporting Company

But it's not as

Official

1

And when a visa application is submitted, then it is

2

adjudicated, and then all of these things are checked,

3

and the determination of age under age one happens, and

4

that is the point where the automatic conversion is

5

going to happen.

6

And as long as that happens while the parent

7

is already a lawful permanent resident, there is no

8

obstacle to conversion and no obstacle to it being

9

automatic because nothing else needs to be done.

MR. FLEMING:

We don't disagree with that,

Justice Scalia, but we have new petitions that were

filed as a protective matter in these cases.

that's not a problem.

But if, for some reason, this Court

these is a sufficient basis to affirm the court of

are fluid.

There is ­­ these aren't hermetically sealed categories.

4

Also, there is no way to apply (h)(3)

5

6

theory of (h)(3) means that some people are going to go

7

out of the F2A category into the F2B category.

Even the government's

And so the question is, under Chevron step
2, which, again, we don't think the Court needs to

10

address, has the BIA drawn a rational line here, within

11

this group of beneficiaries who are all F2B, all

12

children of lawful permanent residents?

13

And the line the BIA drew is it says we are

14

going to treat better people who have two lawful

15

permanent resident parents than people who have one

16

lawful permanent resident parent, often, two, and a U.S.

17

citizen relative.

18

The BIA certainly hasn't provided one.

Is there a rational line for that?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

reasonable reading of this very complicated statute, the

5

Respondents' idea that some kind of internal

6

inconsistency is absolutely required here is wrong.

7

Automatic conversion ­­ the phrase about

So long as the Agency has arrived at a

And the

8

automatic conversion is ambiguous, and it renders the

9

whole provision ambiguous.

10

And let me address the idea that everyone

11

before the comma, everyone in the "if" clause of Section

12

1153(h)(3) necessarily qualifies here.

13

under Respondents' own reading, and it can't be true

14

because there are going to be situations where someone

15

has their age calculated as over 21 as of the date the

16

visa becomes available to the parent, and the parent

17

never becomes a lawful permanent resident.

18

They don't qualify.

That's not true

They come to the

19

border, and they are not let through the border.

20

so, in that situation, there are going to be people who

21

are named in that first part of the clause who are not going to be

be entitled to automatic conversion.

There is no appropriate

I'd like to talk a little bit as well about

Justice Scalia recognized in his question, that somebody

can get a priority date and just walk around with it,

6

odd to say they've got a priority date in their pocket

7

when the statute says the original priority date ­­

8

they'll retain the original priority date.

9

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, but the statute is

10

most reasonably read to say, as all other automatic

11

conversion provisions do, that they retain the priority

12

date if the automatic conversion is possible, so that

13

there's a specific petition being identified that that

14

priority date is going to attach to, and not that you

15

just somehow have a priority date, which is, keep in

16

mind, a filing date, that you're just going to kind of

hold and walk around with and use it if you want.
