ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Thank, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Twenty­five years ago, in Budinich v. Becton

12

Dickinson, this Court unanimously held that a decision

13

leaving unresolved the request for attorneys' fees is a

14

final decision subject to immediate appeal.

15

awarded in Budinich was authorized by a statute that the

16

same rule applies to fees awarded under a contract.

The fee

17

In concluding otherwise, the First Circuit

18

below held that Budinich may or may not apply to

19

contractual attorneys' fees, depending upon whether the

20

fee award in a particular case is deemed part of the

21

merits or not.

22

The First Circuit's rule is inconsistent

23

with each of the core aspects of Budinich, which is

24

likely why Respondents no longer defend it.

25

Budinich held that its rule applies regardless of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Whereas

Official

1

whether the fees are deemed merits or nonmerits, that

2

distinction is the very foundation of the First

3

Circuit's rule.

4

And whereas Budinich emphasized the need for

5

clarity, consistency, predictability, and practicality

6

in jurisdictional rules, and thus, for a uniform and

7

bright­line rule in this context, the First Circuit's

8

rule is case­specific, fact­intensive, abstract, and

9

hard to apply; in short, the very antithesis of a

10

uniform and bright­line rule.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I understand it,

12

the ­­ the First Circuit position is not what's being

13

defended; instead, it's the Eleventh Circuit's position,

14

which is a bright­line.

15

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, it's not a

16

bright­line rule, Justice Ginsburg.

17

rule, but it's still a case­specific, fact­intensive

18

rule.

19

It's a different

The line is just drawn in a different place.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought it was that, if

20

it's statutory, Budinich controls; if it's contractual,

21

then you ­­ you treat it as though it's a question of

22

damages.

23

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right.

It's not a

24

bright­line rule in a number of respects.

25

is that, like the First Circuit, it relies on a

22

any sense or whether it's conceptually justifiable, I

23

thought you were suggesting it wasn't easy to apply.

And it does seem to me that once you say

25

contractual provisions will be treated this way,

in some capacity and a contract in some capacity are

both in play, where you potentially have two competing

There are many cases where a statute

happens to invoke the contractual provision, and under

3

Respondents' rule, you would have two different

4

outcomes.

5

But what we think is really fundamentally

6

wrong with Respondents' position is that, at the end of

7

the day, it's just the opposite of the rule that this

8

Court adopted in Budinich.

9

statutory fees can be viewed as merits or non­merits,

Budinich recognized that

11

Contractual fees are precisely the same.

12

Some contractual fees, depending upon the

13

contract's provision and the relevant decision law,

14

could be viewed as costs.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wouldn't this view

16

contradict 54(d)(2)?

17

accept your analysis that we should superimpose just a

18

flat rule that all fees are not ­­

MR. HIMMELFARB:

If we

54(d)(2) simply requires

20

that, in the case in which fees are sought by motion,

21

they have to be made ­­ the motion has to be made,

22

within 14 days, unless the fees are such that they are a

23

part of the cause of action and they are submitted to a

24

jury.

25

54(d) doesn't say that, in a case where

the fees are made by motion, but they should have been

It simply says that, in a case where a fee

10

So is your rule that if a fee is made by ­­

and not a part of the final merits?

11

MR. HIMMELFARB:

12

That's what Budinich says.

13

That's absolutely right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So you're

14

not blocking a party from coming in and saying, you've

15

got a ­­ how will a union know or a claiming party know

18

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, our submission is

19

that it doesn't matter whether it should have been given

20

to a jury or not.

21

to the jury.

22

general practice in Federal courts, as I understand it,

23

is that fee requests are not given to juries.

What matters is whether it was given

24

At the very least, the amount of the fee is

And, in fact, courts have held that there's no Seventh

attorneys' fees, and this makes sense when you think

4

about it.

It does make sense.

This makes sense because most attorneys' fees

case, go up to the very end of the case.

11

definition, when the jury still has the case ­­ you

12

know, the meter is still going, and it's quite

13

difficult, indeed, it's impossible, for a jury to decide

14

what the fee award should be when there are more fees to

15

follow.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And by

So what do we do with

17

the auditor's fees, which aren't traditional attorneys'

18

fees, and those hadn't been decided in this case?

19

why is the judgment, nevertheless, final, putting aside

20

the attorneys' fees question?

21

when the auditor's fees weren't?

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

So

Why is the merits final

Our ­­ our submission is

23

that auditor's fees are treated, just like attorneys'

24

fees for purposes ­­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's the problem.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I mean, put Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor

2

together.

3

deciding whether a case is contractual or statutory

4

because the judge has to decide.

I don't see any problem that I can see in

5

If there's a contractual part of it, if he's

6

going to deny it, he has to decide the contractual part.

7

So if it's both, it's both.

8

The Eleventh Circuit rule applies.

It counts as contractual.

9

On the other hand, if we don't ­­ if we

10

don't follow the Eleventh Circuit, we get into the

11

question of, well, what about auditor's fees, what about

12

witness fees, what about prelitigation attorneys' fees,

13

what about some language in the contract that seems to

14

cover attorneys' fees, but we're not certain, et cetera?

15

And before you know it, that could even

16

shade into the merits.

17

just say what the Eleventh Circuit said.

18

argument, that yours isn't really an administrative

19

objection, and you have the other argument that, if we

20

follow you, there's a big administrative problem.

21

And so the simple thing to do is

MR. HIMMELFARB:

So we have one

Well, auditor's fees or any

22

other sort of nonattorney professional fees or expert

23

fees or anything else, we think, are not a problem

24

because the truth of the matter is that that category of

25

fees, as a general matter, just like attorneys' fees,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are fees that are incurred in attempting to enforce the

2

underlying right or to defend against the enforcement of

3

the underlying right.

4

They are not some measure of the value of

5

the underlying issue.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So all we're

7

going to have is a contract which, in its discussion of

8

the merits, makes some general mention of fees.

9

now, what we have is the initial notice of appeal has to

10

be within 30 days of the judgment, when the fee issue is

11

not yet resolved, and you're going to try to separate

12

the merits from ­­ I mean, some ­­ you see what I'm

13

worried about, what Justice Sotomayor was worried about,

14

that these things will be very messy when you get to

All of those things ­­ I think the fact that

they did it that way just confirms what I said before,

5

which is that, as a general proposition, at least ­­ you

14

What if they had listed those fees in their

Are you saying something would

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I'm not saying that.

All

15

I'm saying is that this is the way people ­­ litigants

16

generally think about these two different categories of

17

things, and it's understandable that this is the way

18

they did it.

19

if they had requested ­­ you know, attorneys' fees that

20

were incurred at the very beginning, before the

21

complaint was filed, in connection with their proposed

22

findings of fact and conclusions of law, then it may

23

well be that the judge would have awarded them ­­ you

24

know, with the ordinary damages, and they wouldn't have

25

that argument available to them.

If they had requested auditor's fees and

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But they chose to include them, as I say, I

2

think, because their intuition, if nothing else, was

3

that these audit fees and these attorneys' fees ­­ even

4

attorneys' fees incurred before the litigation

5

commenced, are attorneys' fees, in the same sense that

6

the kinds of things that courts decide separately from

7

the merits.

8
9

As far as the so­called prelitigation
attorneys' fees are concerned, this is the fallback

10

argument ­­ the second argument that Respondents make in

11

their brief.

12

the fees requested were incurred before the complaint

13

was filed ­­ or at least at some remote time before the

14

complaint was filed, what you have here is not covered

15

by Budinich because the rule articulated in Budinich is

16

that it applies to attorneys' fees for the litigation in

17

question, for the litigation at hand, fees attributable

18

to the case.

19

rely on in our fallback argument.

20

And the argument is that, because some of

And that's the language that Respondents

What we would say in response to that is

21

that what Budinich meant by that language is that its

22

rule does not apply to a case where the attorneys' fees

23

are for a prior case, as opposed to being attributable

24

to the case, meaning the case in which the fees are

25

incurred.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So if you have a dispute between a lawyer

2

and a prior ­­ a former client, over fees, the former

3

client hasn't paid fees, and there's a lawsuit to

4

recover the fees, Budinich won't apply in that

5

situation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I wrote it.

I don't think

that's what I meant.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a

is.

14

have here that gives rise to the question presented in

15

this case just wouldn't arise there because, if you're

16

talking about a lawsuit by a lawyer against a former

17

client to recover fees owed, by definition, the fees are

18

known and quantifiable before the suit is filed.

19

And not only is it infrequent, the situation you

So you would imagine that, in that case,

20

there'd be a liability determination and the award of

21

damages, which in that case just happened to be

22

attorneys' fees, and the case would be over, and this

23

situation wouldn't present itself.

depend on what the ­­ you know, the contract between the

suppose it's possible that you could have a contractual

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, but I'm asking if

there's a relation between the two.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Sure, there are.

I mean,

14

oftentimes, auditors or any other sorts of experts are

15

retained to ­­ you know, assist the lawyers in

16

litigating the case or investigating.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And to the extent auditors

18

have done a certain amount of work, then there should be

19

no duplicative attorneys' fees, so the judge considers

20

both together.

21
22
23

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right.

I think that's

right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

true.

4

You know what they are.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It would seem to

I want to be clear

5

about this because it's an important distinction.

6

I was talking about was a case where a lawyer sues a

former client, as an example, where the fees were

duplicative recovery when he provides for attorneys'

13

fees for the course of the trial.

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right, but if ­­ if

15

Respondents' fallback position were correct, what that

16

would mean is that, in literally every case, contractual

17

or statutory, you would have to ­­ litigants and courts

18

alike ­­ would have to search through the request for

19

attorneys' fees, which are generally voluminous ­­ the

the attorney, but don't testify, what's the rule of what

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

we're putting in here and what we're not?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, the rule is what I

3

was suggesting before, which is that, if these are fees

4

that are incurred in an effort to vindicate the

5

underlying right, then they're covered by Budinich.

6

that's ­­ I think that's what Budinich is getting at.

7

And

But if, instead, they are sort of ­­ it's a

8

standalone case ­­ and Justice Scalia, I think, may

9

disagree with me about this ­­ but if it's a standalone

10

case where you hire an auditor and you don't pay the

11

auditor's fees and then the auditor sues you for the

12

fees, that's like the example of the lawyer who didn't

13

get his fees paid and sues his former client.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what about a different

15

kind of standalone case?

16

had actually paid up what it was due prior to the

17

litigation, but ­­ but there was still all these

18

outstanding costs that had been incurred for auditors

19

and all of that, and ­­ and a suit was brought just

20

involving those?

21

I mean, suppose that the fund

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think, probably, Budinich

22

would not apply in that situation because it would be

23

like the case I was talking about before, where a lawyer

24

sues a former client, and the case is just the case

25

about fees.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I also think, though, as with the case of a

2

lawyer suing a former client, the situation is unlikely

3

to arise, at least under this contractual fee provision

4

because, by definition, in your hypothetical, you would

5

know what the fees were at the time you filed the case.

6

Presumably, the judgment would be, if it was

7

a judgment for the funds, yes, you're entitled to

8

recover costs, and here's what the costs are, end of

9

case.

You wouldn't have this separate pending request

10

for attorneys' fees.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Himmelfarb, if ­­

12

if I think that we should aim for the rule that trips up

13

the fewest lawyers, what rule would that be?

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I mean, I just think that's

15

absolutely our rule.

16

we're advocating says, if you have a case and the ­­ the

17

merits of the case are decided, liability is determined,

18

damages are awarded, but there's a pending request for

19

attorneys' fees, which may or may not include other

20

types of related professional fees, and you want to

21

appeal that initial decision, you have to file a notice

22

of appeal within 30 days.

It's the Budinich rule.

The rule

23

Under either the First Circuit's rule or the

24

Eleventh Circuit's rule, you are going to trip up a lot

25

of people because they may guess wrong, and they may

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think, I don't have to file a notice of appeal because

2

this is a, quote, "merits," end quote, decision and if

3

it turns out they were wrong, and it's easy to think

4

they might be because this is such a sort of ­­ you

5

know, esoteric kind of distinction, what's a merits fee

6

and what's not, you're going to get people tripped up

7

under either the First Circuit's or the Eleventh

8

Circuit's rule.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So on auditor's fees or

10

anything that might possibly be viewed as falling into

11

the same category as attorneys' fees, you can wait.

12

That would trip up the fewest lawyers; is that right?

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

You ­­ you can't wait if

14

you want to ­­ if you want to appeal the initial

15

decision, if there's a pending request ­­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, right.

But ­­ but if

17

you don't ­­ you can wait and contest those things at a

18

later time when you file ­­ when you appeal from the

19

attorneys' fees?

20

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right.

You would have, in

21

effect, two separate appeals if you wanted to appeal the

22

attorneys' fees decision.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You would argue to the

24

contrary, no, that a rule that says wait till the end of

25

everything that needs to be decided in the case, that's

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the finality rule, and that's the idea behind the

2

finality rule.

3

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right, I mean, the ­­ the

4

relevant statutory provision is Section 1291 of Title

5

28, which speaks of final decisions.

6

decision is under that statute is a decision that either

7

leaves nothing else to be resolved or leaves other

8

things to be resolved, but the only other things that

9

are left to be resolved are collateral to the merits.

10

And the holding of Budinich is that, as a

11

general matter, attorneys' fees are collateral to the

12

merits and that, even when they are not, as a matter of

13

the law that authorizes them, in the interests of

14

certainty and predictability and uniformity, you should

15

treat them as if they are.

16

And what a final

So Budinich has already held that, in this

17

circumstance, the final decision is entered when the

18

initial decision is entered, and the attorneys' fees are

19

collateral, no matter how they're characterized.

20

seems to us it would require a very compelling case to

21

have a different rule, just because of the source of

22

authority ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

It

The words that

24

make your point, I think, not absolutely obvious were

25

when you said, "which may or may not involve other kinds

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of fees."

2

follow your rule, there might be quite a lot of

3

litigation going on about those words, "may or may not."

4

If you follow the opposite rule, we've got a

Now, at that point, I'm thinking, well, if we

5

6

nothing else.

7

anything?

8
9

All right.

So ­­ so do you want to add

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I'm not entirely sure I'm

following the question, but if the concern is about the

10

presence of fees other than attorneys' fees, for

11

example, auditor's fees or economist's fees or what have

12

you, I mean, keep in mind, the same ­­ the same problem

13

would arise under a statutory fee award.

14

Perhaps the most common statutory

15

authorization for fees, at least in the Federal system,

16

is Section 1988 of Title 42, which is sort of a

17

catch­all.

18

an award of expert fees.

19

It applies to 1983 actions.

It authorizes

So if you had a straightforward Budinich

20

situation, where you have a statutory fee award ­­ say,

21

it's a 1983 action ­­ surely, Budinich applies to 1988

22

requests for fees, and 1988 itself authorizes an award

23

of expert fees.

24

So it seems to us you can't have a different

25

rule for contracts if you ­­ if you accept our ­­ if you

reject their principal submission, which is that contracts

should be treated differently from statutes.

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two principles that, I think,

12

resolve this case.

13

claims, no matter how small or large, have to be

14

resolved before a judgment is final under Section 1291.

15

Although, occasionally, Petitioners have suggested that

16

the size of the award somehow makes a difference, I

17

don't think the Court has any basis to depart from that

18

long­settled rule.

The first one is that all damages

19

The second is that, as this Court itself has

20

held in the Vaughan Distilling case ­­ I'm sorry, in the

21

Fleischmann Distilling case and the Vaughan v. Atkinson

22

case, attorneys' fees that are sought under a contract

23

are damages.

24

indistinguishable from any other kind of contract

25

damages that are sought.

They are sought as damages.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know the Petitioner

doesn't rely on it, but it really is supplemental to

10

Justice Ginsburg's point.

There was a judgment in this

case, the June judgment.

And it ­­ and it says ­­ it's

12

entitled, "Judgment in a Civil Case," and it says that

13

the interest runs from this date.

14

Now, I know there are cases in which we say

15

that the description the trial judge gives to the

16

judgment is not necessarily conclusive of this final

17

order, but it does seem to me that this is what the

18

judge thought he was doing.

14

But more importantly, unlike other kinds of

15

contract damages where, if you want lost profits or if

16

you want the cost of some replacement performance, you

don't have to tell the judge what the legal source of

this:

MR. FELDMAN:

I ­­ I don't think it is, and

there's a number of reasons.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feldman, going back

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to my 58(e) question, one thing that's interesting about

2

the rulemakers' response to Budinich is they didn't ­­

3

they didn't make any distinction between statutory and

4

contractual fee awards.

5

You would have us divide the world up that

6

way, statutes one rule, contracts another.

7

the Rule 58(e) doesn't ­­ it's not confined to statutory

8

fees.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

But the ­­

They do ­­ actually, they did

10

make a distinction between fees that have to be proved

11

as part of the substantive claims in the case.

12

actually for ­­ you know, attorneys' fees are actually

13

very close to that.

14

And

I would also point out that the other fees

15

at issue here ­­ this is the other problem ­­ aside from

16

the fact that there's a trap for the unwary set up by

17

their rule, but not by our rule, and that other things

18

being equal, procedural rules should be set up, so they

19

don't have those kinds of traps.

20

But even aside from that, they do have to

21

draw a distinction between attorneys' fees, auditor's

22

fees, accountant's fees, architect's fees, real estate

23

inspector's fees, there's many different kinds of

24

provisions people can put into contracts and say, if you

25

breach the contract, I want a right to inspect the

41
Alderson Reporting Company

property, I want a right to inspect your books, I want a

2

right to figure out whether you've met your covenants in

3

this bond deal or in this business arrangement that we

4

have.

5

And you have to pay for it.

Or you have to

6

pay for it if it turns out that you really have breached

7

the covenant or there really is something wrong

8

with the building.

9

In all those cases, I don't know under ­­ I

10

don't know any way to figure out whether all those other

11

types of professionals that may be involved in the

12

case ­­ they're all the same thing.

stuff other than attorneys' fees.

4

matter.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Merits doesn't

And even then ­­ even in

6

attorneys' fees, if I can just go back to this case for

7

a second, because I don't think this is all so unusual,

8

when the attorneys first came in, they didn't come in to

9

sue Petitioners.

They came in because the auditors

10

weren't getting cooperation and being given all the

11

books that they were supposed to be given.

12

And their first thing that involved a

13

certain amount of time at that point was trying to get

14

them to give the books to the auditors, which they

15

eventually did, okay?

16

But those are costs of collection.

Those

17

fees, under this contract and many, many contracts that

18

are similarly worded, those are costs, costs, including

19

attorneys' fees, of collecting money due, and those

20

costs are due and payable by Petitioners before any case

21

is brought and whether or not any case is brought.

22

If it turned out that the auditors had found

23

that there are some contributions that were not made and

24

the auditors then ­­ and then Respondents ­­ the

25

funds came to the employer and said, you owe us $5,000

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in contributions that weren't made, your books were no

2

good, and we found it, and you owe us another $5,000 for

3

the auditor's fees, they might have just paid that.

4

They should have paid it.

And in many

5

cases, they will, or they might pay one or the

6

other.

7

8

It's not a prevailing party provision, which

It's covering obligations that one

You know, another ­­ another reason why it

14

is important that the Court pay close attention, I

15

think, to the rule against piecemeal appeals in a case

16

like this and the strong policy that, at the very least,

17

if there's any doubt you should avoid the piecemeal

18

appeals, is that, for people ­­ again, in this kind of

19

situation, it can be very, very important to know

20

whether you're going to get your fees paid before you

21

have to file a notice of appeal ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Respondents here, we were ­­ there was, I think,

20

$143,000 in fees at issue that we have to pay ­­ they

21

have to pay the attorneys in this case.

22

And it's very important to them to know

23

whether they have to pay that amount before they decide

24

whether they want to appeal the case or not.

25

It's just as important to decide whether

46
Alderson Reporting Company

they want to appeal that amount than to decide how much

2

they're going to get for the basic contributions that

3

was ­­ that Petitioners also owe us.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if they're worried

5

about it, they could always appeal and withdraw the

6

appeal later.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

They can do it, but ­­
If they ­­ if they don't

get the amount, right?
MR. FELDMAN:

They can do that, but it's ­­

11

the point of the rule against piecemeal appeals is these

12

kinds of decisions are much best left ­­ and this has

13

really long been accepted ­­ till the end of the

14

litigation, not to try to push it up earlier, which

15

creates traps for the unwary of the sort I was talking

16

about.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would apply to

18

statutory fees as well, the argument about piecemeal,

19

duplicative appeals.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

It would apply, but ­­ first

21

of all, a statutory fees case are usually not as broad

22

as this.

23

They're quite different ­­ they look quite different.

24

But they usually involve exercise of district court

25

discretion.

They're usually prevailing parties' fees.

The court may, in its discretion, order

fees.

2

think, like that.

3

Nobody has ever written a contract, I don't

But more importantly, in the statutory case,

4

the court was quite correct, in Budinich, that it's

5

really indisputable that, as a general matter, statutory

6

fees are costs, and costs have never been seen as part

7

of the merits.

8

1988 is just another provision defining costs and

9

extending it a little bit farther.

10

They're defined by statute, 28 USC 1920.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

for some money, based on their performance under the

13

contract.

14

make the least distinctions is say, all of those things

15

are damages and all those things are part of the merits

16

that have been viewed as part of the merits of a case,

17

always.

In the contract case, the court is just

And the simplest way and the way you have to

18

In fact, there's no authority that they are

19

not viewed as part of the merits of the case, and this

20

Court, in the Fleischmann Distilling and the Vaughan

21

cases, viewed it as part of the merits.

22

In the statutory case, the ­­ where Congress

23

may ­­ writes a statute, many, many of them are; the

24

court may, in its discretion, award fees to a prevailing

25

party.

I think the intuition of Budinich was that the

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court ­­ Congress was tying into the long tradition of

2

taking litigation costs and extending it a little bit

3

farther, and that's something that Congress does.

4

And if Congress wanted to say the

5

contractual attorneys' fees are available under some

6

circumstances or under ­­ however, then that would

7

probably be defining costs, too, especially if they are

8

tied to what goes on in the litigation.

9

But when it's a provision like this one, and

10

like many, many contractual provisions ­­ and there's a

11

wide, wide variety of them ­­ that just talks about what

12

happens when there's a breach, and there's going to be

13

attorneys' fees, there's auditor's fees, there's other

14

kinds of things ­­ other kinds of expenses that the

15

nonbreaching party has, those are just the damages of

16

the case.

17

They've always been seen as the damages of

18

the case.

19

say, well, these have to be treated like they were

20

costs, then it does inevitably raise the question what

21

else has to be treated the way of ­­ the ­­ costs.

22

And it would be odd if you do start to try to

Petitioners said that ­­ you know, in this

23

case, there was no doubt that anybody had ever, in this

24

case, that we were seeking contractual fees.

25

reason that I think is pretty conclusive on that, aside

50
Alderson Reporting Company

And one

Official

1

from the fact that we mentioned it at every single

2

opportunity throughout the case, that we were seeking

3

contractual fees, in our summary judgment motion, in our

4

trial brief, post­trial, in the complaint ­­ it was

5

everywhere.

6

But we ­­ the auditor's fees that we were

7

seeking probably wouldn't have been awardable under

8

ERISA because the ERISA provision, 29 USC 1132(g) says

9

you get reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the

10

action to be paid by the defendant.

11

at all, that that would include ­­ I don't know any

12

authority that that includes auditor's fees.

13

But the contract was quite clear.

And I'm not sure,

Costs,

14

including attorneys' fees of collecting payments, and

15

the auditor's fees did fit in that ­­ in that basket.

16

And nobody doubted it throughout the litigation.

17

was no litigation about whether we are entitled under

18

anything to auditor's fees because there's no point in

19

litigating the ERISA issue because it was clear under

20

the contract.

21

There

And the district court absolutely knew that

auditor's fees were involved in the case because the

In any event, if ­­ our submission is that

the Court ­­ that contractual attorneys' fees have

time when they were enforcing the contract, which

ultimately got enforced and before there was litigation,

14

and the auditor's fees for examining the books that were

sums that were due and owing, entirely without regard to

damages in the case.

is that it seems to me the colloquy itself that that

11

comment precipitated shows how confusing it can be to

12

make the determination.

13

Mr. Feldman also suggested that there are a

14

few other examples where you might be seeking fees under

15

a contract in the statute.

16

of State statutes that authorize an award of fees in

17

contract cases of different kinds.

18

a case involving an employment dispute, which was

19

necessarily a contractual dispute, and the Colorado

20

statute at issue there provided for the award of fees in

21

employment disputes.

22

Keep in mind that there are lots

Budinich itself was

So you can imagine a situation where you

23

have a contract and a statute that say the same thing,

24

there's an entitlement to fees, and yet, for whatever

25

reason, the party seeking fees invokes one, rather than

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the other, and yet, the outcome under Respondents' rule

2

would depend upon which was invoked.

3

Mr. Feldman also suggested that our rule

4

presents a trap for the unwary.

I have to say I'm having a

5

hard time understanding that.

6

rule are that you always have to file after the initial

7

decision, and if you do that, there won't be any risks.

8

It won't be too late, and it won't be too early.

9

The consequences of either the First

The consequences of our

10

Circuit's rule or the Eleventh Circuit's rule are that,

11

if you file after the second decision, it may be too

12

late ­­ too late, you won't be able to appeal the

13

first decision, but if you file after the first

14

decision, it may be too early, if it's subsequently

15

determined that these are merits fees and the case isn't

16

over, and your appeal will be dismissed, and you have

17

expended your resources on having an appeal dismissed.

18

As to the logic, the ­­ the fundamental

19

premise of Respondents' position is that all statutory

20

fees are costs, all contractual fees are damages, and

21

all I'd say about that is that it's just incorrect.

22

There are statutory fees that look a lot like the

23

contractual fees at issue here.

24
25

There are contractual fees that are
straightforward prevailing party provisions, some of

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which are bilateral, meaning that the defendants can

2

prevail.

3

a contract, whatever else that contractual provision is,

4

it can't be damages.

5

If a defendant recovers attorneys' fees under

Budinich said statutory fees can be merits

6

or nonmerits.

7

Likewise, contractual fees can be merits or nonmerits.

8

There's absolutely no reason to adopt the opposite rule

9

for that category of fees.

We're going to treat them as nonmerits.

10

Judgment should be reversed.

11
