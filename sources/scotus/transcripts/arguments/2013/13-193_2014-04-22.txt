ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. CARVIN:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Under this Court's straight­forward precedent,

12

this case presents a clearly ripe and justiciable

13

controversy.

14

there's a credible threat of enforcement.

15

THAT there's a credible threat of enforcement because

16

the Commission's Probable Cause panel in 2010 said that

17

the speech at issue probably violated Ohio's false

18

statement law.

19

All agree that the test is whether or not
Here we know

Since an enforcement agency has already told

20

us that this statement probably violates their law, we

21

obviously face a clear and very credible threat of

22

enforcement if we repeat those statements as we alleged

23

we would do.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you making that

argument on behalf of the other organization?

1

Anthony List, you have accurately described what

2

occurred.

3

charged before the Ohio Election Commission.

4

any reason to believe anybody's going to lodge a

5

complaint against it?

6

But the other organization has never been

MR. CARVIN:

Is there

Well, Your Honor, when they

7

filed their complaint, they alleged that they had not

8

spoken those words because Susan B. Anthony had already

9

been drawn into the Commission's procedures and the

10

Commission had already found probable cause.

11

since ­­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

How is that any

13

different from ­­ how is that any different from the

14

people in Younger, who the Court dismissed as having no

15

standing because they hadn't been prosecuted despite the

16

same identical claim?

17

intend to do something similar, et cetera.

18

MR. CARVIN:

They were chilled, they might

Well, as Justice Brennan put it

19

in Younger, the ­­ the speech that the other three

20

speakers were going to engage in was not even of the

21

same genre as that of the person who would be ­­ was

22

being prosecuted, which is why the Court, quite

23

correctly said, that their chilling effect was based on

24

an imaginatory or speculative fear of enforcement.

25

Whereas here, COAST was going to say precisely the same

Alderson Reporting Company

words that SBA had already been found to have probably

2

violated the False­Statement Law.

3

imagine or ­­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's hard to

I thought that the Court

5

in Younger said with respect to those other three, that

6

they had never been threatened with prosecution.

7

don't recall it made a distinction on the basis of

8

what they wanted to talk about.

9

MR. CARVIN:

I

Well, two of the people were

10

labor picketers that had never been threatened and one

11

was somebody who was simply teaching Marx in a classroom

12

environment.

13

who had been prosecuted under the incitement to violence

14

law.

15

statements, compared them to the statements of the

16

person who had been prosecuted and said they're not even

17

of the same genre.

18

They were quite distinct from the speaker

And, again, Justice Brennan looked at their

So we're not arguing that somebody could

19

come in here and argue that anything that's

20

controversial creates a credible threat of enforcement,

21

but we've got a very specific concrete example.

22

A says X, that's found to have a probable cause.

23

Speaker B quite reasonably thinks if they've just

24

dragged Speaker A in front of this Commission and the

25

Commission has found probable cause, there's no reason

Alderson Reporting Company

Speaker

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the one question is

3

who is the "they"?

4

Anthony List is considered a group with real clout.

5

a candidate might be really concerned about Susan B.

6

Anthony's speech.

7

not as well funded and the candidate says, well, a lot

8

of things are said in political campaigns.

10

Now, it might be that Susan B.
So

But the other organization maybe is

I'll let

This one doesn't hurt me as much.

MR. CARVIN:

Two points, Justice Ginsburg.

11

First, Driehaus had shown a very ­­ he was in the middle

12

of a very tough reelection campaign and he had shown he

13

was going to take all the steps he could to squelch this

14

notion that he supported taxpayer abortions.

15

already spent all the money in terms of SBA list.

16

literally ­­ all he'd have to do is Xerox it to ­­ to

17

come after COAST.

He had
So it

18

But I think the key point here is we don't

19

have to negative every conceivable hypothetical on why

20

Driehaus might not do this, and the Commission might not

21

do that.

22

violated the laws as the Probable Cause Panel said we

23

probably had, that the agency is going to enforce the

24

law.

25

then the only way to test that hypothesis is to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you square this

with Clapper?

MR. CARVIN:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I apologize.
Why isn't this as

6

speculative as Clapper?

7

there's a candidate who is going to react by initiating

8

an action, you have to assume further that a panel is

going to render the same decision, and you have to

You have to assume first that

24

MR. CARVIN:

If the speaker doesn't

Justice Kennedy.

2

respond to the complaint, the Commission's regulations

3

make it clear that they may well view that as a default

4

judgment and ­­ and enter a judgment against us right

5

away.

At the initial stage, if we don't

6

Once the probable cause determination comes

7

down, you have all of these kinds of subpoenas and very

8

intrusive discovery of the sort you had in our case

9

where they ask for our communications with everybody on

10

the right wing of the political aisle, where we have to

11

reveal our internal communications as well as those of

12

others.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, the State can

14

characterize its own position, but do you understand the

15

State to say that well, the existence of the Commission

16

means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they

17

can actually get some protection by an advance ruling.

18

Is that the State's position?

19

MR. CARVIN:

No.

Neither the Commission has

20

argued that, and the Attorney General's amicus on our

21

side makes it quite clear that there is no provision for

22

doing it.

23

probable cause hearing in three days.

24

no opportunity to wipe out so­called frivolous claims.

25

If you read their rules, they have to go to a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

thought their position was that this would ­­ would

2

sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or

3

something like that.

4

MR. CARVIN:

That's precisely right.

5

They're arguing ­­ the whole point of this statute is

6

some kind of truth­telling function, so they want us

7

to ­­

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is a provision for

an advisory opinion, unless the question is if you are

10

arguing strenuously that this statute violates the

11

Constitution.

12

an advisory opinion saying that the statute can't be

13

enforced, but you didn't do that.

14

You could have asked the Commission for

No, we didn't because we think

15

that's unconstitutional.

political speech as falsity.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is ­­ is your argument

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I just want to make it

16

clear that the threat of enforcement is particularly

17

acute here because not only is ­­ is enforcement power

19

ethical and political accountability things.

20

our political opponents is ­­ is empowered under the

21

statute to bring us in front of the Commission.

22

they have to do is Xerox the Driehaus complaint, Xerox

25

is millions of people who were deputized under the

So all

So since there

1

statute, who have every political motivation to squelch

2

our speech in ­­ before a campaign, then I think ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that would suggest

4

something even broader.

5

the first instance, before the probable cause

6

determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that

7

it's going to be speaking about a very controversial

8

subject in which some people will think it's telling the

9

truth and other people will think it's lying, and that

That would suggest that even in

10

there's a very good chance that somebody is going to

11

bring this to the Commission.

12

that they have standing even at that moment before the

13

initial probable cause determination is made.

14

MR. CARVIN:

So that would suggest

Justice Kagan, we can agree

15

that given the amorphous nature of this prohibition in

16

the false statement, it's difficult to predict in

17

advance who and when is going to do it.

18

to my prior answer, all of that ambiguity is gone once

19

the expert agency has already told you that there's a

20

probable cause to believe it violates it.

But to return

21

So this separates us from every other

22

speaker who is simply concerned that they will be

23

brought in front of the Commission.

24

identifiable track record that we have been brought in

25

front of the Commission.

We have an

And in that regard, I would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

point out that the Secretary of State is obliged to

2

refer anything to the Commission if he has ­­ should

3

know that there's a violation.

4

Well, in the wake of the Probable Cause

5

Panel's prior probability determination, it would seem

6

that he's either ethically obliged to file a complaint

7

against us or at least there's a very high likelihood

8

that he would.

9

sight of the other side of the calculus, which is that

And, again, I don't want us to lose

10

if ­­ if we have to prove all of these hypotheticals

11

with certainty, if we have to engage in more the

12

presumption that the State will enforce its own laws,

13

you have created an insoluble dilemma for speakers,

14

because you have ­­ you have conditioned their access to

15

the political marketplace of ideas on a very serious

16

threat of being dragged into this process.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let me ask you

18

something going back in part to Justice Kagan.

19

Basically, as a bottom line, you think there's nothing

20

that could be salvaged from this process.

21

you think that even if your client speaks a falsehood,

22

it still chills improperly.

23

MR. CARVIN:

Presumably,

We think that if the commission

24

is going to drag us in front of them to justify our

25

political speech to a bunch of State officials that

Alderson Reporting Company

they ­­ that is, A, Article III cognizable injury, and

2

B, unconstitutional.

3

Justice Ginsburg ­­

4

I was explaining to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're ­­ you're not asking

5

us to resolve the constitutional question, just the

6

question of whether you can raise the Constitution.

7

MR. CARVIN:

All we're trying for is our day

8

in court so that we can make this argument.

9

just explaining to Justice Ginsburg that that's a reason

And I was

10

we wouldn't voluntarily invoke a procedure that we are

11

about to challenge as constitutional.

12

cutting off our nose to spite our face.

13

It would be

And ­­ and I also would like to point out

14

that this is election speech.

15

very significant components to it.

16

obviously the core of the First Amendment.

17

we choose our representatives in our democracy.

18

also has an extraordinarily short shelf life.

before an election, and the day after the election no

21

one either speaks or listens.

22

23

points, which means two things.

serious Article III injury.

2

But the other point is you're never going to

3

be able to adjudicate it within that 60­day window,

4

right?

5

judgment, which means that the speech will become

6

arguably moot after the election, in which case you go

7

to the capable of repetition yet evading review

8

exception to mootness, which is essentially the same

9

kind of prediction of future activity that's implicated

10
11

You're never going to go from complaint to final

here.
If you adopt the extraordinarily Draconian

12

requirements that the Sixth Circuit imposed on credible

13

threat, this means that you will literally never be able

14

to challenge restrictions on election speech, right?

15

Before the campaign it will be premature.

16

enforcement proceeding, Federal courts have to abstain

17

under Younger.

18

and then no ­­ no possibility of capable of repetition

19

yet evading review.

20

which has existed for decades in Ohio, where they

21

continue to impose very serious burdens on speakers on

22

what we consider a facially unconstitutional law, yet it

23

has consistently evaded judicial review precisely

24

because of the short time frames of the election ­­

25

During the

MR. CARVIN:

Oh, if you accept our view of

5

credible threat, then ­­ then you're ­­ you're entirely

6

right, we would ­­ we would satisfy both the ripeness

standard and the capable of repetition yet evading

What I was trying to point out was

straitjacket that the Sixth Circuit imposed on speakers

11

trying to bring pre­enforcement challenges in the First

12

Amendment context, that will essentially guarantee that

13

these things are never brought, because by the time the

14

election is done then you will have a mootness argument

15

and you won't be able to satisfy the capable of

repetition yet evading review standard.

most on point because there the prohibition was, like

identical speech against others.
MR. CARVIN:

A preliminary finding and

12

identical speech we think more than satisfies the

13

credible threat thing for the reasons I was articulating

14

to Justice Kennedy a few moments ago.

15

exceeds the showing that was required in Holder,

16

Babbitt, American Booksellers, and a number of other

17

cases as well.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think this is a

19

matter of standing or ripeness?

20

ripeness.

21

MR. CARVIN:

We think this far

The Sixth Circuit said

In all candor, Justice

22

Ginsburg, I can't figure out the difference between

23

standing and ripeness in this context.

24

we are being subject to something.

25

is whether or not the threat is sufficiently immediate.

Alderson Reporting Company

No question that

I think the question

19

I think people tend to think about that as a ripeness

2

issue, but I think all of the Court's teachings on

3

standing and immediacy of injury from the standing cases

4

apply equally here.

5

ripeness in this context as essentially coextensive.

6

And I think the Sixth Circuit was wrong for both

reasons.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PARTIAL REVERSAL
MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin, if I could, by addressing

8

Justice Kagan's question, which Justice Sotomayor then

9

followed up on.

We think that the probable cause

10

finding and the fact that they want to repeat

11

essentially the speech that was made earlier are the two

12

critical factors in this case and without that, none of

13

their claims would be justiciable.

14

that their purely legal First Amendment challenges are

15

ripe for those particular case­specific reasons.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As it is, we think

Well, you ­­ you

17

insist that they ­­ there has actually been a probable

18

cause finding that their speech would violate the law

19

before they would have standing?

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Not necessarily that their

21

particular speech would violate the law, but that there

22

have been ­­ without the probable cause finding, it

23

would simply be speculative whether particular speech

24

would actually result in any sort of enforcement

25

proceeding.

One critical aspect of this case ­­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even in a case like

3

this, where the procedures can be triggered by any

4

citizen in the State?

5

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, again, we

6

don't think that someone can come into court and say, I

7

want to make some speech, I don't think that speech

8

would be violating the statute, I don't have any good

9

evidence that anyone else thinks my speech would violate

10

the statute or that some sort of enforcement action

11

would be brought against me, but nevertheless, I want to

12

get into court ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a realistic

14

proposition?

15

surely you don't expect them to come in and say, I'm

16

going to say something totally false and I'm afraid I

17

might be prosecuted for that.

18

they have ­­ you would never imagine that somebody else

19

might think in a hotly contested election that their

20

speech is false?

21

I mean, first of all, in the first place,

MR. FEIGIN:

But then you have to say

Well, Your Honor, we may be

22

simply debating how similar the previous speech that was

23

a subject of a probable cause finding, or that there's

24

some other reason to believe will be the subject of an

25

enforcement proceeding has to be to the speech that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

plaintiffs allege that they intend to make.

2

definitely don't think that a plaintiff can simply come

3

into court and say, look, I want to make this speech, I

4

don't think it violates the law.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But we

Well, what would happen,

6

Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew ­­ it

7

seems actually quite plausible that Representative

8

Driehaus would know ­­ that this was something that

9

Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about

10

in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all

11

these groups saying, if you start advertising in this

12

way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you

13

before the Ohio Commission.

Would that be sufficient?

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Would that

That specific threat would be

4

enough to allow for a lawsuit.

5

there'd be a significant question whether the suit could

6

only be brought against Driehaus, who brought the

7

threat, or whether you could also join in the

8

Commission.

9

really make much difference because if constitutional

claims were raised in that proceeding, the district

the State of Ohio would be entitled to intervene in the

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, take it just a step

15

further.

16

­­ I don't know.

17

there some kinds of statements where, even though the ­­

21

statement that, given this process, it's just going to

22

require too much fortitude to resist the temptation to

23

bring this in front of this Commission.

24
25

Surely, there are some kinds of statements or

Are

It's the kind of

Well, Your Honor, I think in

the absence of good evidence of an enforcement

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25

proceeding, it would simply be too speculative.

2

would add that in this particular case, the credible

3

threat of enforcement test might be relaxed to a certain

4

extent, because this is a private attorney general

5

statute.

6

general statutes is to allow for enforcement in a wider

7

range of circumstances than would be possible under most

8

Federal laws, for example, which are enforced solely by

9

the executive.

But I

And the entire point of private attorney

That might be a reason, a case­specific

10

reason why your hypothetical might have more salience

11

here than it would in the Federal context.

12

Another difference between this and the

13

Federal context is we don't have any potential statutory

14

barriers to bringing this action.

15

decided to provide a cause of action only for a ­­ for,

16

for example, final agency action, as it did in the

17

Administrative Procedure Act, and it's not attempting to

18

channel these claims through a particular agency.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress hasn't

Are you arguing that the

20

other organization, COAST, also has standing?

21

you ­­ you seem to require for the credible threat for

22

there to have been a proceeding before the Commission

23

and there's been nothing with regard to the other

24

organization.

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Because

Your Honor, we don't think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

the proceeding before the Commission has to involve the

2

entity that wants to make the speech in the future.

3

It's enough that it involves speech similar to the

4

speech that the plaintiff is alleging that the plaintiff

5

intends to make.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So how do you distinguish

7

the three in Younger v. Harris that the Court said

8

didn't have standing?

9

MR. FEIGIN:

I think in the same way the

10

Petitioners do, Your Honor, and I think that's how we

11

reconcile the case with Steffel, where one of the

12

factors the Court looked to, to find a credible threat

13

of enforcement in that case was the actual prosecution

14

of the plaintiff's hand­billing companion.

15

One thing I would emphasize about this case

16

is that in this particular context, this unique Ohio

17

scheme, the administrative proceedings before the Ohio

18

Elections Commission are the relevant enforcement

19

proceedings.

20

administrative proceedings that can result only in

21

government speech would be considered enforcement

22

proceedings for that purpose.

23

circumstance, not only can the Ohio Elections Commission

24

recommend a case for further prosecution, but a decision

25

by the Ohio Elections Commission is a decision by a

It wouldn't normally be the case that

But in this particular

Alderson Reporting Company

27

neutral decision maker following a full­dress adversary

2

proceeding that someone has violated Ohio criminal law

3

by knowingly misinforming the electorate in the context

4

of a political campaign.

5

In that particular context, and particularly

6

as to entities like Petitioners that engage in political

7

advocacy on a regular basis, that kind of finding is a

8

significant sanction.

9

views it that way in two relevant ways.

And, in fact, the State itself
First of all,

10

such a finding by the Commission is treated as an

11

adverse effect for purposes of the statute that allows

12

for judicial review.

13

actual orders by the Ohio Elections Commission, they

14

sometimes refer to the finding of a violation in

15

particular cases as a penalty.

16

And second of all, if you look at

Before my time is up, I would like to

17

address a few things Petitioner said about the

18

justiciability, for example, of as­applied challenges

19

under this Court's decision in Holder.

20

very significant that in Holder, the Court noted that

21

there were ­­ Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project ­­ the

22

Court noted that there had been 150 prosecutions brought

23

under the statute that the plaintiffs in that case were

24

challenging and that many of them had involved the same

25

provision.

I think it's

And we think that's a circumstance in which

Alderson Reporting Company

28
1

there would be a credible threat of prosecution because

2

the plaintiffs had showed a pattern or practice of

3

prosecution of similar conduct.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How many proceedings

have been brought under this Ohio statute?
MR. FEIGIN:

So under the Ohio statute

7

between 2001 and 2010, according to the statistics in

8

the green brief by the Ohio Attorney General, it's a

9

little bit over 500.

And that's just for violations of

10

this False­Statement Law or asserted violations of this

11

False­Statement Law.

MR. FEIGIN:

on that, Your Honor.

The brief doesn't break it down.

If the Court has no further questions, we'd

18

ask the Court to partially reverse and allow only the

20

proceed.

25

MR. MURPHY:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29

2

please the Court:
The Court should affirm the Sixth Circuit's

3

judgment in this case because Petitioners have not

4

established a credible threat of criminal prosecution

5

and any other injury, to the extent it is adequately

6

alleged, is not certainly impending.

7

begin with the prior probable cause finding.

8
9

And I'd like to

Petitioners repeatedly characterized the
prior probable cause finding as a finding by the prior

10

panel that the ­­ the speech at issue there was probably

11

criminal.

12

a very, very low standard.

13

it's ­­ it's well below a preponderance of the evidence,

14

so "probably criminal" is way too high.

15

it's analogous in the civil context to ­­ to a malicious

16

prosecution case; one of the elements is to establish

that a prior case lacked probable cause.

This is

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your very argument,

3

Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is

4

a very low standard, seems to me to work against you.

5

It means that more complaints are more likely.

6

MR. MURPHY:

Well, it depends on what you

7

are talking about the relevant injury is.

8

relevant injury is a criminal prosecution, I think it

9

very much shows that a prosecution is entirely unlikely.

10

And if your relevant injury is some of these preliminary

11

injuries that they're asserting, I do think that the

12

credible threat test is probably not even the test

13

because, as the Court said in Clapper, injuries in that

14

context had to be certainly impending.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the

Well, but this is a point

16

brought up by Justice Scalia's question as well.

17

you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with

18

a state law that requires you to come before a

19

commission to justify what you are going to say and

3

of the United States?

4

asked the question.

5

MR. MURPHY:

Is there a case which says

Now, there may be.

That's why I

So I think the closest case

6

would be Golden, for instance, where the Court clearly

7

indicated, and I quote, "The constitutional question,

8

First Amendment or otherwise, must arise in the context

9

of a specific live grievance."

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was a very

11

special situation.

12

a particular candidate.

13

political view that an organization is taking, and they

14

are not targeting this particular candidate, but they

15

are targeting that issue, any candidate who supports

16

that issue.

17

In Golden they were going out after

MR. MURPHY:

It was not ­­ it was not a

Well, with respect, Your Honor,

18

in Golden the plaintiff clearly indicated that he was

19

targeting that congressman because of the congressman's

20

votes on ­­ for a particular care package.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But didn't the Court say

22

that there wasn't ­­ once that congressman wasn't going

23

to run for office any more, there was no suggestion that

24

they wanted to talk about somebody else.

25

MR. MURPHY:

So he did have suggestions that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

he wanted to engage in substantially similar leafletting

2

in the future, and the Court found them too speculative

3

because he had only identified that one congressman.

4

And so I think that's significant because I think by

5

analogy that would suggest that the only single

6

forward­looking allegations in SBA List's complaint at

7

JA­122 are that it plans to engage in substantially

8

similar activity in the future, but they don't identify

9

any other candidates, just like they didn't identify any

10

other candidates in Golden, just like they didn't

11

identify any candidates in the Renne decision, which was

12

part of the reason why the Court found the decision ­­

13

that case right there.

14

12

So I

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARVIN:

A few brief points.

I think

15

the key point to take away from the colloquy with

16

Mr. Murphy is that when he was asked, How do you bring a

17

pre­enforcement challenge, his only solution was to

18

admit you're lying before you speak.

19

that completely defeats the value of your speech.

20

speaker is ever going to do it.

21

confess to a crime before you speak.

22

out in Babbitt they didn't say they were going to lie.

23

They said just the opposite, and they nonetheless had

24

standing.

25

Well, obviously

You're not going to
And I would point

On the certification point, further delay in

the Ohio Supreme Court for a limiting construction that

2

we don't want, that can't possibly do it.

3

Alvarez, this fact/opinion distinction is of no legal

4

relevance.

5

want to say that anything, fact or opinion, is

6

unconstitutional to limit under the false statement law.

7

After

We don't want a limiting construction.

We

I point out that we did litigate in front of

8

this very same district court judge the fact/opinion

9

issue in the libel case, where it does have some

10

resonance, and he's already found that our assertion was

11

factual.

12

So we don't want to go on that tangent.

If the Court would just look at them,

13

Browskins and Citizens United, those cases articulate as

14

well as any can, when you are making a facial challenge

15

to a First Amendment, the last thing you want to do is

16

abstain to State court judges because you actually

17

exacerbate the constitutional injury through the delay

18

and the fact that you've got to go through declaratory

19

judgments, when our entire point is it's

20

unconstitutional for us to say, "Mother, may I?" before

21

we speak.

22

As to Mr. Murphy's attempt to downplay the

23

probable cause finding, on 7A attached to their brief

24

they have what the probable cause finding is.

25

says that there is probable cause to believe that

need to show it by clear and convincing evidence, and

7

even though my opponent claims that any reasonable

8

interpretation of this law is not false.

9

means that they've already found that through clear and

Well, that

10

convincing evidence we are advancing not only a false,

11

but an unreasonable interpretation of the ACA, which

12

simply, of course, exacerbates the credible threat.

13

And I think my final point will be, he

14

says ­­ well, two things.

15

allege with specificity the kind of speech that we were

16

going to say in the future.

17

18

language, the English language, permits a more direct

19

and precise articulation of what we're going to say in

20

The only difference will be, instead of

22

Representative Driehaus, we will substitute

23

cycle but for the chilling effect.
This is obviously completely different from

3

Golden, which my opponent continues to raise, where

4

the Court found that the only interpretation of the

5

facts is that the plaintiff's, quote, "sole concern" was

6

with the representative at issue, who had gone off to a

7

judgeship.

8
9

It is blazingly obvious that our sole
concern is not Representative Driehaus.

It is any

10

legislator that voted for an Act that we believe

11

devoutly has "taxpayer­funded" and "abortion" in it.

12

So we're facing a credible threat.

We ask

13

the Court to lift this yoke so that we can become full

14

participants in the next election cycle.

Unless there are any further questions, I
thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel,

counsel.

The case is submitted.

above­entitled matter was submitted.)
