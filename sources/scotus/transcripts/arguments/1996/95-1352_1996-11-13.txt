ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. MIX:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents issues at the intersection of
the Civil Rights Act and the habeas corpus statute.
In his civil rights complaint, Mr. Balisok seeks

14

relief from harm stemming from allegedly unconstitutional

15

procedures at a prison disciplinary hearing.

16

liberty interest that has given rise to these procedural

17

protections is the loss of good-time credits, Mr. Balisok

18

does not seek restoration of those good-time credits in

19

this action and reserves that claim for a later time.

22

QUESTION:

Although the

He has not finally waived it or

surrendered it, though, has he?
MS. MIX:

Mr. Balisok has specifically reserved

23

his right to contest and litigate over the loss of good­

24

time credits at a later time.

25

QUESTION:

One minor point.

This is a retrial on the same charge

I believe so, Mr. Chief Justice.
Has he been retried?
I believe so, yes.
Well, then why -- wouldn't the whole

good-time calculus begin anew if he were convicted?

I think the good-time calculus would

the system right.

served while he's in a pretrial detention status and the

4

good time is going to be calculated on the whole of his

5

sentence.

So, he's receiving credit for time

6

As a result of the allegations of this

7

complaint, the question presented by this case is whether

8

certain prisoner cases which purport to be about due

9

process procedures but which may inevitably or logically

10

entail a shorter duration of confinement should proceed as

11

habeas corpus actions with the attendant exhaustion of --

12

13

QUESTION:

May I just add one point to it?

You

14

said inevitably be shorter.

15

argument that there is a State law doctrine that he may or

16

may not lose his good-time credits?

MS. MIX:

Do you disagree with his

I'm not sure precisely which doctrine

you're referring to.

Well, the same or other evidence.

MS. MIX:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. MIX:

The some evidence standard?
Some, yes.
It is correct that if there was a lack

24

of some evidence in the hearing, that our position would

25

be that his good time could not stand, that the hearing

2

that that is the only basis upon which the hearing

3

sanction could be reversed.

4

expressed, that the some evidence standard is the only

5

basis to reverse a hearing sanction, then it renders the

6

rest of the rule protections meaningless.

7

serious due process violations and under the theory

8

advanced by Mr. Balisok, those serious due process

9

violations could not result in a reversal of the sanction

10

If you take his position as

You could have

imposed in the disciplinary hearing.
QUESTION:

11
12

But we do not agree with Mr. Balisok

your answer.

I'm not sure I totally understand

Let me rephrase my question, if I may.

Is it correct that at least in theory he could

13
14

win this lawsuit and say there were Federal violations of

15

his procedural rights, rights of -- violations of his

16

Federal procedural rights and nevertheless end up still

17

losing his good-time credits?

18

MS. MIX:

Is that a possibility?

That he could win this particular suit

19
QUESTION:

20
21

And not get his good-time credits

restored.
MS. MIX:

Our position is that that is not what

would occur, that if he were to -QUESTION:
in your view?

Well, is it possible or just unlikely

will happen, but your whole argument is based on if this

2

could result, that's enough, but I'm just wondering if you

3

agree that it will not necessarily result.

4

MS. MIX:

We believe that the allegations that

5

Mr. Balisok has made necessarily invalidate the sanction

6

of his -- imposed in his hearing, that they are so

7

serious.

They go to the fundamental -QUESTION:

8

And they necessarily would require

the restoration of his good-time credits?
10

MS. MIX:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, under the Heck test.
Then in order for you to prevail, you

12

would not have to advocate the rule that you do advocate

13

in your brief.

14

MS. MIX:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.
I see.

r

16

QUESTION:

And are you taking the position now

17

that if he succeeds here and then ultimately does

18

challenge his confinement on habe that you're not going to

1

claim harmless error?

20

now?

21

Are you taking that position right

There's no harmless error doctrine?
MS. MIX:

With respect to the claims that he is

22

asserting in this complaint that they are serious enough

23

that a harmless error doctrine would not be brought to

24

bear on these claims, but I --

25

QUESTION:

Some due process claims would be

1

subject to harmless error, but this would not.

2

MS. MIX:

3

QUESTION:

4

That is correct.

That is --

What is peculiar about this that

disentitles it to a harmless error analysis?

5

MS. MIX:

The nature of the allegations made by

6

Mr. Balisok are the arbitrary denial of witness statements

7

that go to his fundamental ability to prove his innocence

8

and put forth a case and prove his innocence before the

9

disciplinary hearing.
QUESTION:

10

But what if those witness statements

11

are brought in and it turns out they're really not very

12

relevant at all?

You'd still say no harmless error?

MS. MIX:

13

No.

At that point I think a district

14

court looking at that or a State court in habeas corpus,

15

could conclude that there was harmless error.

16
17

QUESTION:

Then there's nothing inevitable in

this case.

18

MS. MIX:

But just looking at the allegations of

19

the complaint as stated, our position is that some due

20

process violation, some allegations that alleged serious

21

deviations from the rule of standards, will inevitably

22

lead to the restoration of good time.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but you've just said -- excuse

24

me.

25

that we in fact cannot tell at this stage whether this is

Have you not just said in answer to Justice Scalia

one of those cases?
MS. MIX:

2

3

We think this is one of those cases,

but the State of Washington -QUESTION:

4

You know what the witnesses are going

5

to say.

You know, for example, that his hypothetical

6

cannot be true in this case?

7

MS. MIX:

No.

You don't know that.

You have to

8

look at just the bare, naked allegations of the complaint

9

to make that determination.

10

QUESTION:

But doesn't -- isn't it the case --

11

and I don't want to go on too much longer with this, but

12

isn't it the case that based on the allegations, you

13

simply cannot tell in this case whether the -- whether his

14

success at this stage will inevitably result in an

15

entitlement to reduced time.

16

MS. MIX:

17

You cannot tell.

Well, we have not wanted to concede

that point in this case because --

18

QUESTION:

I realize.

19

MS. MIX:

20

But I think it is true in the prison

21

disciplinary context, unlike the criminal arena that the

22

Court analyzed in Heck, that it is more difficult to say

23

certain allegations inevitably will affect the outcome

24

because of the application of the harmless error doctrine

25

in prison disciplinary hearings and because --

-- we think they are so serious.

QUESTION:

1

One of the oddities in this area is

2

that we have the State arguing that the prisoner is

3

probably going to prevail in all of these procedural

4

matters, and in order to establish a 1983 suit, the

5

prisoner argues the contrary.

6

positions, which makes me wonder if the doctrine isn't

7

incongruous at its foundation.
MS. MIX:

8

9
10
11

Yes.

We've got you switching

We realize that we were

elevating Mr. Balisok's claims to a certain degree by our
position.
But I think the problem is that, as I said, the

12

prison disciplinary context is a more fact-bound

13

determination and you do not have the same principles to

14

apply in that context that you have in the criminal arena.

15

QUESTION:

The question you present in your

16

petition for certiorari is whether Heck bars the 1983

17

action brought by a prisoner challenging prisoner

18

disciplinary procedures, if the success of that action

19

would necessarily imply the invalidity of the prisoner's

20

loss of good time.

21

Now, that was the language used in Heck I

22

believe, necessarily imply, but that could mean -- is

23

there a probability, a possibility, or a certainty?

24

really is what we have to decide here, what that language

25

in Heck meant?

That

MS. MIX:

1

Yes, and that certainly is the

2

language in Heck, and I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the

3

problem you have in a prison disciplinary case, in a case

4

like Balisok, is that if we can't conclude that there is a

5

100 percent chance that the sanction is going to be

6

reversed, then the lower courts are saying that doesn't

7

meet .that language in Heck that says necessarily

9

removed.

And so, he can have his case one degree

It can be very, very serious allegations.

Yet,

10

the court can't say with 100 percent certainty that this

11

is a case that will necessarily invalidate the sanction

12

and that case will go forward in 1983.

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, are you asking us to make some

clarification of Heck or change it in some way?
MS. MIX:

15

We are proposing that the Court adopt

16

what we refer to as a bright line rule to address a

17

broader context of cases, particularly prison disciplinary

18

cases.

So, your answer is yes to my

Yes.
You do want a change or a

clarification in Heck.
MS. MIX:

Yes.

I don't think you have to change

the holding in Heck, and certainly, as Mr. Balisok has

1

suggested, we are not asking for a reversal of Heck.

2

we do think that the Court needs to clarify language in

3

Heck and language in Wolff v. McDonnell.

4

QUESTION:

But

Ms. Mix, this is bait and switch.

We

5

just decided Heck a couple of years ago.

6

have taken this case in order to decide whether we should

7

reconsider a case just decided.

8

9

We would not

The question you presented in your petition was,
does this Court's ruling in Heck bar a 1983 action that

10

would -- that would -- necessarily imply the invalidity of

11

the prisoner's loss of good time?

12

question, and I assumed we were going to have a case

13

before us where it would necessarily imply the invalidity

14

and that the Ninth Circuit ignored what Heck seemed to say

15

very clearly, that where it -- not seemed to say -- said

16

very clearly -- that where it would necessarily imply

17

invalidity or shortening of the sentence, you have to do

18

it by habeas.

That's how you put the

19

Now you come before us with a totally different

20

proposition that Heck is inadequate to the real world and

21

we should adopt some new proposition.

22

a nice argument, but I resent being forced to confront

23

that argument when it's not what I thought we were taking

24

the case for.

25

MS. MIX:

I mean, that may be

Well, Justice Scalia, what we have

1

done is we have argued that Heck is applicable to a

2

category of cases in the prison disciplinary context and

3

that it does fit squarely into that context, that the

4

lower courts are doing that.

5

QUESTION:

I thought the issue was whether good­

6

time credits comes within Heck.

That is simply whether

7

eliminating a good-time credit is part of necessarily

8

shortening the sentence.

9

we were going to grapple with was.

That's what I thought the issue
But, gee, very little

10

of the debate -- in fact, I think none of the debate --

11

goes to that point.

12

MS. MIX:

Justice Scalia, I think that whichever

13

route the Court goes with this case, it is very important

14

to say that Heck explicitly applies in the prison

15

disciplinary context and that good-time credits are, as

16

the courts have consistently found, within the definition

17

of fact and duration of confinement --

18

QUESTION:

And it would do some good just to

19

decide that point, right, even if we don't reconsider Heck

20

and adopt a much more expansive rule?

21

MS. MIX:

It would do some good to address that

22

point, but there will continue to be difficulties just

23

under that rule because the courts, such as the Ninth

24

Circuit, can take a very serious --

1

consider those difficulties, but I didn't think we had

2

agreed to consider them here.
MS. MIX:

3

What I'm saying, though, is even if

4

you make explicit that Heck applies to the prison

5

disciplinary context, if the lower courts are going to

6

say, but nothing fits within the necessary invalidation

7

rule of Heck, the rigors of the Heck test, then we haven't

8

achieved very much.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Mix, I'm confused and perhaps you

10

can help me.

It seems like everything that you are

11

discussing is academic because in this case, as I

12

understand the prisoner's complaint, he's not saying that

13

the conduct, the bad conduct in which he engaged in, isn't

14

conduct that's subject to a good-time reduction.

15

What he's saying is I'm a jailhouse lawyer, and

16

I'm going to be brought up on these disciplinary charges,

17

and most of the time they've got me.

any of these proceedings to keep that good time.

talking about whether I was a bad actor in prison.

I'm saying is I want a procedure that isn't infected by

these witness statements.

But I want the

And I may, if I did the bad act, sure, they can take away

He's saying whenever there's discipline in this

6

So, how do we even get to your question?

7

MS. MIX:

That is how Mr. Balisok has presented

8

his complaint certainly and how he would like his

9

complaint to be read, but we have to remember a couple of

10

things.

11

right to go challenge his good time later, and by allowing

12

him to proceed with just a procedures challenge, to

13

rectify the procedures that you have described, what we do

14

in that case is we put the procedural interest ahead of

15

the substantive interest.

16

One is that he has specifically reserved his

QUESTION:

We allow --

Well, what's wrong with that?

What's

17

wrong with saying if a prison going to have a disciplinary

18

proceeding, it's got to be fair?

19

MS. MIX:

And that's very basic.

Because this Court has said on a

20

number of occasions that procedural due process exists in

21

the first instance to protect against the mistaken and

22

unjustified depravation of liberty.

23

of those procedural rights should not be at the expense of

24

the substantive interest that they are there to protect.

25

And the vindication

1

will get his procedural victory in his 1983 action, and

2

then he will take that procedural victory back to the

3

Washington State courts and use it to bolster or demand

4

relief on his loss of good time on his substantive claims.

5

QUESTION:

But is that necessarily true?

Isn't

6

it at least possible if he won this case, you could have

7

another prison disciplinary action and follow all the

8

procedures he requests and come to the same conclusion?

9

MS. MIX:

That is correct, but I would

10

characterize that, Justice Stevens, as comparable to a new

11

trial, a new hearing, where the relief -QUESTION:

The first one is, is Wolff v. McDonnell and Heck

And yes, it is.

Second, do the Heck principles apply to prison

Yes, they do.

Third, is it important for our system of justice

that prisoners be permitted to file 1983 claims to protect

violations of procedural due process at prison hearings?

20

Yes, it is.

And finally, does Mr. Balisok's amended

a challenge to the elimination of good-time credits?

Otherwise, you have no standing.

MR. RICE:

Footnote 9.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

I see.

4

MR. RICE:

Look at footnote 9 where this Court

5

says, while we have no occasion to rule on the matter at

6

this time, it is at least plain preclusion will not

7

necessarily be an automatic or even permissible effect.
And then in the explanation of that it says, the

8

9

court-made preclusion rules may, as judicial application

10

of categorical mandate of section 1983 may not, take

11

account of the policy embodied in section 2254(b)'s

12

exhaustion requirement that State courts be given the

13

first opportunity to review constitutional claims bearing

14

upon State prisoner release from custody.
So, that's where you get the dichotomy on the

15
16

case where 1983 deals with procedure, an unconstitutional

17

procedure.

18

But we are not asking for return of his good

19

time.

20

We're saying this was a hearing involving good time, which

21

is a liberty interest.

22

still remains that.

23

We're not asking for reversal of the hearing.

This Court has said that good time

And second, when you've got a liberty interest

24

at stake, you're entitled to a minimum of due process for

25

a fair hearing.

And that's all we're in court asking for

this -- for Mr. Balisok to have is his hearing -- is a

Ms. Mix, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN D. MIX

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Rice.

8

MS. MIX:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Even if there is no preclusion with respect to

10

the successful 1983 action, I think the primary concern

11

that the State has is that the State interests and comity

12

interests are not served by the State having a second

13

independent opportunity to look at this claim.

14

And the problem that we have with what has been

15

described here is exactly the situation of running between

16

the courts where Mr. Balisok says, well, yes, indeed he

17

will go back to State court and present this declaration

18

to the State court, this declaration of a Federal court,

19

that there have been procedural violations of

20

constitutional magnitude at this hearing.

21

And the State court is in the position at that

22

point of either rendering an inconsistent result with a

23

Federal district court that has looked at the same issue

24

or the State courts and State officials are in the

25

position of being persuaded by that -49

QUESTION:

1

Of course, it is true that this

2

problem only arises if you lose in the Federal court.

3

Most of these cases you're going to win in the Federal

4

court.

5

MS. MIX:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MIX:

If he win -- if -That's right.
Yes, if he wins in a Federal court,

8

we'll have that problem, and that is the precise situation

9

that leads to conflict among the courts that this Court

10

has said should not be allowed to occur.
And the situation gets even worse because if Mr.

11

12

Balisok then wins in his State habeas corpus petition, he

13

has yet another avenue back into Federal court for the

14

actual harm from the confinement.

15

times into the courts and multiple avenues into Federal

16

courts when we bifurcate these actions and allow a 1983

17

procedures-only claim to proceed as described by Mr.

18

Balisok.

19

So, we have multiple

The second point I'd like to address is just a

20

question of whether the procedures are part and parcel of

21

the liberty, and we think very much that they are.

second part of the Heck holding is very critical with

respect to our rule.

MS. MIX:

Under the rules we have proposed,

Carey could remain a good rule in that it would allow
