CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Between 1989 and 1991, the jury found Judge

11

David Lanier sexually assaulted five women in his judicial

12

chambers, one by repeated forcible oral rape, the others

13

by what the jury concluded was "physical abuse of a

14

serious, substantial nature."

15

As to each count on which Lanier was convicted,

16

the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt first that

17

Lanier's conduct had deprived the victims of a right

18

secured or protected by the Fourth Amendment.

19

That is, the right to be free of unjustified

20

physical abuse, including sexual assault, of a serious,

21

substantial nature under color of law and, second, that he

22

had acted wilfully, which the court defined in accordance

23

with this Court's decision in Screws v. United States.

24
25

A divided en banc Sixth Circuit ordered the
indictments dismissed because in the majority's view the

1

due process right to be free of forcible and coerced

2

sexual assault had not been made specifically --

3

sufficiently specific for the defendant to have known that

4

in assaulting his victims he was violating their

5

constitutional rights.

6

In concluding that sexual assault or any serious

7

unjustified assault committed under color of law cannot be

8

prosecuted under section 242, the court below

9

misapprehended Screws and applied a standard no court has

10

ever found necessary or appropriate.

11

Because the jury found that Lanier had sexually

12

assaulted his victims while acting under color of law and

13

with the knowledge and intention of violating their legal

14

rights, and because decisions of the Federal courts had

15

made specific the due process protection of those rights,

16

the defendant was properly and constitutionally convicted

17

in this case.

18

QUESTION:

Why does it have to --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, two of the concurring

20

judges in the court of appeals I believe felt that the

21

oral rape should be sustained but that the misdemeanors

22

simply, I believe, weren't under color of State law.

23

the Government take any position on that here?

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:
Justice.

Does

Well, yes, we do, Mr. Chief

First of all, I would stand corrected.

I had

1

thought that what the two dissenting justices said was

2

that the misdemeanors didn't rise to the level of a

3

specifically defined constitutional violation.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, you may be right.

I'm not

sure.
MR. WAXMAN:

6

But in any event, we do disagree.

7

We certainly recognize that there is a very significant

8

difference in degree as to the conduct with respect to the

9

coerced oral rapes and the conduct with respect to the

10

other five misdemeanor convictions, but the right that has

11

been made specific in this case is the right that this

12

Court in Ingraham v. Wright identified.

13

the substantive due process "right to be free from

14

unjustified intrusions on personal security."

15

QUESTION:

It made specific

Well, if that's true, then why

16

does -- there has to be a serious touching, or a serious

17

assault, because that was part of your submission at the

18

outset.

19

controlling, why is not any offensive touching a violation

20

of the act?

21

If indeed it is the fourth Amendment that is

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, your -- Justice Kennedy, your

22

question raises a lot of issues.

One is whether it's the

23

Fourth Amendment that's controlling, and the second, why

24

it is that substantial serious was included in the jury

25

instruction.

If I can -- I will attempt to answer each of

them separately.
We don't think --we did not understand that the
Fourth Amendment was controlling in this case.

this was

alleged, the indictment alleged that this was a
substantive due process violation, the substantive due
process right being the right to freedom from unwarranted
intrusions by under color of State law physical integrity.
We don't understand the Fourth Amendment
cases -- and that was our effort to articulate a right
that had been made specific by this Court in a series of
due process decisions.

We did -- have not understood this

Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, particularly in
light of James Daniel Goode Real Estate, to include
searches or conduct that occurs either outside the law
enforcement context or, in any event, as not part of a
search for or an effort to protect evidence of wrongdoing.
QUESTION:

So in your view the Fourth Amendment

is not really the controlling element in this case.
MR. WAXMAN:

We think that it's not, although if

it were, we would urge the Court to find that in any event
there is no prejudice to the defendant because in any
event the constitutional right alleged to have been
violated would have been the Fourteenth Amendment, since
the Fourth Amendment would apply only as incorporated, and
the sub -6

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, the idea of the Fourth

2

Amendment does go way, way back, even to Boyd v. United

3

States, of any invasion of a person's personal security.

4

Is that not so?

5

you mentioned the Fourth Amendment, didn't you?

6

7

And I thought in your very first remarks

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I -- if I did, I certainly

meant to say the Fourteenth Amendment.

QUESTION:

MR. WAXMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, that was what misled me.
Okay.

I apologize to the Court.

I perhaps misheard you.
I left off a digit.

In any event, we don't think, even

14

if it were the Fourth Amendment -- I think this is

15

responsive to both of your questions -- even the test

16

would be the same, because the question under substantive

17

due process under Ingraham and its progeny, whether --

18

would be whether the physical intrusion was

19

"unjustified" --

20

QUESTION:

21

then, which is how --

22

MR. WAXMAN:

23

Okay.

Let's get to the next part,

-- and then the Fourth Amendment

test would be unreasonable.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WAXMAN:

How serious it has to be.
Well, in Ingraham this Court

recognized in the due process context, as this Court
recognized in McMillian and the Eighth Amendment context
and other courts have recognized, that "there is, of
course, a de minimis level of imposition with which the
Constitution is not concerned."
Now, the problem in every case, of course, is to
determine whether or not that de minimis threshold was
surmounted.

In the case of the forced oral rape of Vivian

Archie, I -- we submit there is no possible -- there's no
conceivable notion that it wasn't surmounted, but if we
look to this Court's precedent, in Ingraham itself, after
stating that there was a de minimis level of imposition,
it held that because in Ingraham itself appreciable
physical pain was inflicted the threshold was certainly
met.
Now, that threshold, the threshold of de
minimis, is one which decisions of this Court have not
made more specific, but lower -QUESTION:

Well, maybe -- maybe -- the

instructions here certainly called for more, did they not?
MR. WAXMAN:
QUESTION:

They certainly did.
They called for physical abuse of a

serious, substantial nature involving physical force,
mental coercion, bodily injury, or emotional damage which
is shocking to the conscience, so clearly this instruction

1

envisioned something much more serious than passing some

2

de minimis line.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

That is absolutely correct, and

4

that is why I would submit to the Court that because

5

the - QUESTION:

6

7

was wrong?
MR. WAXMAN:

8

9

Well, do you think that instruction

Well, we thought that the shocks-

the-conscience standard was unnecessary.
The defendant asked for it.

We didn't submit

10

it.

11

cumulative of the other requirements, the serious and

12

substantial nature that the jury had --

13

QUESTION:

It was clearly

I mean, the problem you'd have is

14

that virtually every arrest where handcuffs are put on, or

15

anything of the sort, would result in a Federal case as

16

well as any ordinary excessive force claim.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Well, I think -And I think that has to be a concern,

of course.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

It very -It may not affect this case because

22

of the instruction here, but I think this issue is

23

terribly important, whether it's just some de minimis

24

threshold that's left out, or is it something more.

MR. WAXMAN:

We agree that it is a very

1

important question, and if I could, Justice O'Connor, let

2

me address this case and then get to where -- how we think

3

these cases should be decided under other circumstances.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I prefer that you'd get right

5

down to what the heart of the standard is and then talk

6

about the facts here.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

We think that at a minimum

8

the standard is a serious and substantial intrusion, and

9

we think that because the jury was so instructed in this

10

case, that as to those counts that the jury convicted --

11

and the jury was quite discriminating in this case.

12

acquitted on three counts, and one count was dismissed by

13

the judge on a motion for judgment of acquittal.

14

It

As to those counts on which the jury convicted,

15

there is more than enough, way more than enough evidence

16

for a rational fact-finder to conclude --

17

QUESTION:

Serious and substantial, as you're

18

putting it, is almost inconsistent to me with the concept

19

of a misdemeanor, which is what some of these convictions

20

were.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

It's true that all but the oral

22

rapes were misdemeanor convictions, but none -- it may be,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, that the instructions in this case set

24

the bar too high.

25

Ordinarily in -- I would think in one of these

1

cases a trial judge, if presented with a clearly

2

insignificant or relatively insignificant intrusion, would

3

apply the same Jackson v. Virginia standard that it would

4

apply, for example, in a 1983 suit or a 242 prosecution

5

brought alleging that a -- that in the course of an arrest

6

or a seizure unreasonable force was used.

7

9

QUESTION:

There's a real element of vagueness

in all of this, though.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, there is in this as in, for

10

example, when a jury is asked to decide whether a search

11

and seizure is unreasonable --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, you just --- or whether an obscenity case -Mr. Waxman, you just mentioned 1983

15

in connection with 242, and it would help me very much if

16

you would clarify two things about the relationship.

17

everything that would be susceptible to a 1983 charge also

18

indictable under 242, and is there any difference in the

19

state of mind requirement in the two?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

First of

21

all, there is a significant difference in the state of

22

mind requirement.

23

Under 242, under Screws, this Court has said

24

that 242 may constitutionally be applied only if the

25

defendant acted wilfully.

That is -- and I'm quoting
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Is

1

Screws -- when persons act wilfully in the sense in which

2

we use the word, they act in open defiance or in reckless

3

disregard of a constitutional requirement which has been

4

made specific and definite, and in deciding Monroe v.

5

Pape, for example, this Court emphasized a much higher

6

intent requirement that is required.

7

QUESTION:

I understand the abstract concept,

8

but frankly I don't understand when one intentionally

9

beats another human, to take an example, what is wilful

10
11

any more than intentional in that context.
MR. WAXMAN:

Intentional in conventional

12

common -- in conventional criminal law terms, and it's

13

reflected in all of the pattern jury instructions, an

14

intent to do a crime, a specific intent to do a crime

15

means that you intend to do the act which you do.

16

But as this Court said in Screws, the common

17

definition of wilfulness implies something much more.

18

That is, a bad purpose, or a specific intent to do

19

something that the law forbids, knowing that the law

20

forbids it, and intending that it be forbade, and that in

21

fact is precisely what we have in this case.

22

In this case we really have quite an

23

extraordinary set of circumstances.

In the motion for

24

judgment of acquittal the -- Judge Lanier's counsel said,

25

and I am quoting at page 110 of the Joint Appendix, I am

satisfied that a deprivation of freedom and liberty from

2

sexual assault is adequate.
And when Judge Lanier testified, and I'm quoting

3
4

now from volume 9 at page 1569, he was asked, question:

5

Well, you understand, for example, judge, that everybody

6

in this country has a right to be free from sexual assault

7

and abuse.

8

understand that.

You understand that, don't you?

Yes, sir, I

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Waxman, that's --

10

QUESTION:

That's not clear at all whether --he

11

could have been answering in response to State law,

12

Federal law -- a vague question like that doesn't prove

13

much.

14

QUESTION:

And it's not true anyway, is it?

15

Everybody doesn't have a Federal -- we're talking here

16

about a Federal constitutional right.

Now, I had thought that when we were dealing
with the Due Process Clause's procedural component,

10

procedural due process, any action of the State would

11

suffice to come within this provision of being the right

12

guaranteed by the Constitution, so that even if the State

13

is acting as employer and terminates your contract without

14

proper procedure it would be a deprivation of procedural

15

due process, but I had not thought that when we're talking

16

about substantive due process every activity of the State

17

brings down upon those State actors the prohibitions of

18

the Federal Constitution.

19

For example, if someone goes into a motor

just acting like an employer.

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

It must be exerting State power, not

Well, Justice Scalia -A policeman, for example, arresting

6

someone is exerting State power over you, and if in the

course of that he beats you up, substantive due process

8

has been violated.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, I understand your

10

point about State action.

Let me say first that although

11

I understand your view of the proper construction of the

12

terms, under color, dozens and dozens of lower court

13

decisions have not construed it that way, including many

14

of the assault cases and other cases that this Court has

specifically cited approvingly.

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

I disagree -He jumps up and beats -I disagree, and I could cite -So any physical tort committed by a

State agent in the course of his employment is a

13

constitutional violation.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

A -- an assault committed by a

15

State agent in the course of his employment, or something

16

that satisfies the Classic definition of under color of

State law, if it violates State law --

18

QUESTION:

You see, I just don't agree.

I

19

cannot imagine that 242 was meant to cover that situation

20

in which a, you know, a State bureaucrat jumps up from the

21

desk and punches somebody out.

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, let me give you an example

23

from Polk v. Dodson, a case that this Court decided, in

24

which case this Court held that a State public defender

25

was not acting under color of law when she was engaging in

1

the representation of her clients because, as this Court

2

subsequently explained in West v. Adkins, she was acting

3

as the adversary of the State.

4

In Polk v. Dodson this Court said we leave

5

undisturbed cases like, for example, the section 242

6

prosecution in the Seventh Circuit case of United States

7

v. Senacht, where a State public defender was prosecuted

8

and convicted under 242 for extorting money from friends

9

and relatives of people that he was representing.
QUESTION:

10

But that was in relation very

11

specifically to his duties.

this courthouse a janitor leaped out of a closet, abducted

13

a woman, and molested her.

14

in your view?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Supposing in your case in

Would that be a 242 violation,

Probably not.

It would be very

16

difficult, I think, to -- I think it would be impossible

17

to show that the janitor was acting under color of State

You have to determine how to give content to the

words, made specific, and we think that the made specific
standard under 242 and clearly established standard under
qualified immunity cases are and ought to be considered

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED G. KNIGHT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. KNIGHT:

11
12

I do.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

It seems to me that the exceptional aspect of

14

this case from a factual standpoint, as a 242 case, is

15

that the respondent was convicted of offenses involving

16

the spontaneous use of physical force, but as a public

official he had no legitimate authority to impose force on

citizens.

authority when he committed the --

4

QUESTION:

Oh, I understand your point there,

5

but I think my question is this:

if we should determine

6

that the court of appeals was wrong in applying a standard

7

which goes beyond what Mr. Waxman suggested, in other

8

words that goes beyond reasonably definite, and instead

9

require the substantially identical circumstances or facts

10

I think is how the court of appeals articulated it, if we

11

say that was an error, isn't it possible to dispose of

12

that issue without ever determining whether in this

13

particular, or in any of these particular instances the

14

office or the judge in this case was acting under color of

15

law?

16

MR. KNIGHT:

I believe you could dispose of that

17

issue, but I believe that in addressing the due process

18

issue there would have to be a finding of State action in

19

connection with this conduct, and State action is in my

20

mind so closely allied with the concept of acting under

21

color of law, I think it would be difficult for this Court

22

to enunciate a due process violation without addressing

23

the question of whether the conduct could be considered

24

State action, which would be very close to determining

25

whether it was action committed under color of State law.

QUESTION:

1

Well, I suppose we would just say we

right must have been articulated prior to the commencement

4

of this prosecution, or prior to the act charged --

Yes.
-- and questions of State action and

color of law are simply --

8

MR. KNIGHT:

QUESTION:

-- not covered by our opinion.

MR. KNIGHT:

10

Well --

I would contend, Your Honor, that

11

in determining how specific the due process right must be

12

articulated, or have been previously articulated, the

13

Court would address the question of in what context is the

14

assault conducted?

15

someone who happens to be a public official a due process

16

violation?

17

In other words, is assault per se by

I would contend that that's too broad, that

18

that's beyond the ambit of what Screws had in mind, and

19

that therefore the governmental context in which the

20

assault was conducted would have to be determined, which

21

to my mind brings you back to the question of the State

22

action and the governmental context in which the assault

23

was committed.

QUESTION:

point of breadth that you raise, but I'm not sure that I

1

can agree with you that we could not decide the case on

2

the grounds of what I will call prior definite statement

3

of the right without getting into color --

4

MR. KNIGHT:

Well, I do believe, Your Honor,

5

that as an abstract proposition certainly you could decide

6

the due process issue if you felt that the due process

7

issue could be determined without reference to considering

8

the governmental context in which the assault occurred.

9

If you adopt the Government's view in this case

10

that unjustified interference with physical integrity,

11

which I take it is coextensive with assault, if you decide

12

that that is a definite enough statement of due process

13

violation to pass muster, then I would agree that you

14

would not have to consider State action or the

15

governmental context in which the assault occurred.

16

But my fundamental contention in this case is

17

that that definition that has been proposed by the

18

Government is far broader than any definition certainly

19

this Court has undertaken and, in fact, I think is

20

contrary to several holdings of this Court, or certainly

21

to the spirit and thrust and intent of a number of

22

decisions that have been rendered by this Court.

1

against a free person as opposed to someone who is in

2

custody, that would be a violation of 242?

3

MR. KNIGHT:

I cannot, Your Honor.

It's quite

4

difficult to conjure that up, and I've tried to do that,

5

and I've been asked those hypothetical questions along the

6

way in these appeals, and I cannot.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what about a policeman trying

8

to keep order at a parade or in a demonstration who

9

just -- and has authority to -- he doesn't have custody of

10

the onlookers, but he has authority to keep them back from

11

the street, and he wades in with a baton and starts

12

beating them?

13

Wouldn't that qualify?

MR. KNIGHT:

I suppose, Your Honor, you do get

14

situations where there is not custody in the full sense of

15

an arrest and something happening after the arrest.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

I don't think the issue is custody.

I think the issue is the exertion of State power.
MR. KNIGHT:

I would agree with that, Your

21

injuries that occur while in custody.

Suppose the judge is presiding at a trial, and the -- this

your view?
MR. KNIGHT:

13

QUESTION:

MR. KNIGHT:

Right.
Your Honor, that is a use I would

think possibly of governmental power.

QUESTION:

Well, I would say -- I'm sorry,

Your Honor, but that phrase was used.
QUESTION:
MR. KNIGHT:

Yes.
But I would insist that the proper

phrase would be misuse of authority, not misuse of power
in the sense in which the Government meant it, which was
misuse of his status as a judge, which for the most part,
to the extent there was any alleged misuse, simply was a
subjective feeling on the part of these women that they
would not report these assaults because he was a judge.

whether there is a Federal right made definite, and is it

sufficient in your opinion that the Federal right involved

is a right given by the Due Process Clause of the

cannot take from a person irrespective of what procedure

it gives?

MR. KNIGHT:

All right.
You'd say, one, this is in the area

of substantive due process, i.e., the State cannot remove

it from a person irrespective of the procedures.

QUESTION:

If a policeman can't beat up a

8

person, say in the parade, can't hit him over the head,

9

can't put his fist in the person's face at the parade, I

10

suppose it's somewhat similar to have offensive sexual

11

contact with a woman at the least.

12

difference between those two things?

13

MR. KNIGHT:

Is there some

I don't think -- I think -- I think

14

there's -- the only difference there would be is that if

15

there is sexual abuse, that would be a sort of a continuum

16

of the exercise of force that began the situation as

17

opposed to a policeman that simply beats up Rodney King

18

and says this whole process was an exercise of legitimate

State authority in which I was subduing, trying to arrest

him, and trying to defend myself.

21

But if I could, Your Honor has mentioned Screws,

Weren't they concerned with the

the position of having a surprise pulled on him when to

it would not have seemed reasonably definite in advance

that what he was doing was in fact a substantive

But that boils down to saying, it

Isn't that what they were getting at?
MR. KNIGHT:

I think that was part of it, but I

14

also think that there was great concern in that opinion

15

for the ex post factor problems.
QUESTION:

16

But isn't that the ex post facto

17

problem?

18

the ex post facto problem, it seems to me, goes away

19

because you've got what is admittedly a formula criminal

predates the act, and doesn't that respond to the ex post

of the prisoner being led down the hallway to trial and a

Well, I think it's certainly a

fiction in terms of thinking that these deputies were -had the Constitution in mind.
QUESTION:
MR. KNIGHT:

Yes.
But I'm not sure it was a fiction

in terms of the facts, because there was evidence that the
deputy had said, we're going to get this guy, and they
arrested him under some pretext and killed him before he
could be tried, so I think there were facts from which a
jury could conclude that in a factual sense they really
were depriv -- they really did intend to deprive him of
legal process and kill him before he could be found
innocent, but I mean, that's -- as I read the case, that's
what was going on.
And I do think that the concern of all seven of
the justices that -- well, seven of the nine, was that
this statute might be so vague as to be almost subject to
due process objection on its face, and I think the intent
was to construe it very narrowly to require very specific
constitutional violations and intent factually to violate
those rights.

Anderson v. Creighton where the Court said, well, the
contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a
reasonable official would understand that what he is doing
violates that right.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Waxman, though, you're

not -- qualified immunity is a civil concept, really.
Certainly you might want a more demanding standard in the
area of the criminal law, it seems to me.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, for sure you would, and the

way the standard is made more demanding, Mr. Chief
Justice, is by the requirement of a showing that the
defendant acted with a bad purpose, with an intent to
violate the law.

there's a certain fiction about all of that.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I'm not sure that I really

understand what the fiction is.

The -- it is true that in

Screws the -- under Screws there is an obligation to
identify in the indictment the specific right violated and
the manner in which it was violated.
The Government in Screws chose to allege that
the right violated was the deprivation of a right to have
a trial and a conviction before punishment.

It may be, we

don't know why, that that's because Screws was indicted
and decided before Rochin and Ingraham and Youngburg and

QUESTION:

Well, the fiction is is that they

probably weren't thinking in constitutional terms, and if
you use the term wilfully, then you say well, you intend
the consequences of your act, but then you're right back
where you started from.
MR. WAXMAN:

That is exactly right, and what

this Court said in Screws, and I quote, it is not
necessary that you -- to show or prove that the defendant
was thinking in constitutional terms at the time of the
incident.

You may find that the defendant acted with

reckless and specific intent even if you find that he had
no real familiarity with the Constitution -QUESTION:

But that seems to take out the one

specific element that you put in at the beginning of the
premise.
MR. WAXMAN:

No.

What the Court said was, if I

can just continue, that you had to show -- it's not
material whether they were thinking in constitutional
terms, but you have to show that their aim was not to
enforce the law but to "deprive the citizen of a right,
and that right was protected by the Constitution."
