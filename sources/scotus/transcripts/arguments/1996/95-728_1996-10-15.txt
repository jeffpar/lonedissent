CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

Well, we'll hear

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TARANTO:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The Federal Circuit's ruling should be reversed

11
12

because it violates two aspects of the fundamental

13

principle that it is up to the patentee through its own

14

drafting and through the available PTO processes to define

15

its patent boundaries before the patent issues, not later,

16

in an infringement action.

17

Our narrower point is that once Hilton Davis

18

accepted rather than appealed from, the PTO's demand that

19

it write the specific pH limit into the patent, that limit

20

became binding under this Court's doctrine of prosecution

21

history, or file wrapper estoppel.
QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

Factual inquiry, Mr. Taranto.

What

is pH?
MR. TARANTO:

The pH is a measure of the acidity

of a solution, which ordinarily -3

QUESTION:

Thank you.

2

MR. TARANTO:

-- stands for the potential of

3

hydrogen, so that wine would be very acidic, water not at

4

all, et cetera.
QUESTION:

5
6

But the lower the pH, the higher the

acidity?

7

MR. TARANTO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

So it's that kind of measure.
It's upside down that way, yes.

10

This Court's doctrine of prosecution history, or

11

file wrapper estoppel has always said, in a way unaffected

12

by Graver Tank, that there should be no second-guessing of

13

the reason for the examiner's demand for a limit once the

14

patentee has accepted that demand and bypassed the appeal.

15

That principle states a critical limit on any otherwise

16

available doctrine of equivalents, and itself requires

17

reversal here.

18

QUESTION:

Does that raise -- I'm sorry.

19

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

20

QUESTION:

Does that place you in the following

21

odd position, and I may not understand your position, so

22

let me raise it now.

23

Your -- sort of your fallback position is that

24

the doctrine not to apply only in a case in which the so-

25

called point of equivalence was within the claim that was

1

actually made, but which for some reason would not have

2

been enforceable, the claim was, for whatever reason, too

3

broad.

4

And yet, if I understand you correctly, and

5

that's what your position would be, then the person who

6

claims too much, but invalidly, is in a better position

7

than the person who, before the patent examiner, gives up

8

more than he has to, because the Patent Office indicates

9

that without such a concession they won't give their

10

approval, and doesn't that present a sort of a anomalous

11

position that the person who goes the whole hog and more

12

is going to end up in a better position than the

13

individual who concedes too much simply to get the patent

14

through.

15

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I think that the fundamental

16

point is that it's in the PTO that the process of

17

negotiating about proper breadth can and does take place.

18

If someone comes in, as applicants have an

19

inherent incentive to do, and seek broader coverage

20

because it gives them greater rights and more opportunity

21

to exclude the world from something, then a process takes

22

place.

23

application, and there is a discussion about why.

24

Here, there were, I think, two or three

25

In most cases the examiner will reject an initial

rejections of the initial application, basically because

1

of the obviousness of the filtering of these dyes.

But

2

then, as I think is indicated at pages 103 and 107 of the

3

Joint Appendix, as Hilton Davis' description of its

4

interview with the examiner shows, Hilton Davis went into

5

the examiner and the examiner said, okay, now I'm

6

persuaded that if your pH is above 9, it won't be obvious

7

anymore.

8

But it also --he also said, make sure the pH is

9

above 6, and he pointed specifically to the specification,

10

the part of the long disclosure that says, here's where we

11

say what we know works.

12

this record why the examiner said 6 as the lower limit,

13

and the Federal circuit just missed that.

14
15

So it is, in fact, apparent in

Now, it I think would generally be true that a
patentee -- I'm not sure I understood exactly the --

16

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's still the case --

17

accepting everything you say, as I understand your

18

position, it's still the case that when the PTO is perhaps

19

asleep at the switch and it let's a claim through which in

20

fact is broader than would ultimately prevail, that is the

21

one case in which in your fallback position the doctrine

22

of substantial equivalents would be recognized, is that

23

correct?

24

MR. TARANTO:

25

QUESTION:

Well, that's right.

Yes.

If --

MR. TARANTO:

1

The narrower ground, the

2

prosecution history estoppel ground, in this case applies

3

only where there's a rejection of a broader claim, or a

4

claim that then introduces a limit, and the patent

5

applicant has bypassed the appeal mechanism for

6

challenging that.

7
8

There are other situations where there's a
potential estoppel without a rejection and amendment where
the applicant says something to put the world on notice

10

that he interprets his claim in a particular way.

11

not this case.
If the PTO is, as you say, asleep at the

This particular case involves an example of a

1

2

specific demand for a limit written into the patent that

3

the applicant accepted, and there's a good reason for

4

Congress' having insisted that the right way to challenge

5

those limits is through the appeal mechanism.
One reason is that it make sense to assume that

6

7

the PTO examiner in fact had a good reason if the

8

applicant bypasses the appeal, but there are also two

9

important structural advantages.

One is that disputes

10

about the proper flexibility or clarity or breadth of the

11

patent are resolved before it's issued, and the second is

12

that in the internal appeal mechanism the examiner

13

participates, and so the PTO can clarify whether -- can

14

clarify the reasons for the rejection.

15

The alternative is that in the infringement

16

action, where the PTO is a complete stranger, PTO isn't

17

there.

and this is a - -

The court and the parties are let to speculate,

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, you've said -- maybe I

have it wrong -- that the PTO made a mistake of fact as to

the 6 and above.

QUESTION:

when the PTO makes it precise, that's it and you can't

have any doctrine of equivalents, but wasn't there a

difference between requiring 9 and under and the 6?

thought it was the prior art that was the blockage to

3

going above 9.

MR. TARANTO:

Right.

There are different

reasons for the -- for -- I don't think the PTO made a

QUESTION:

9

No.

I think the PTO got it exactly

No, you said the Federal

circuit --

10

MR. TARANTO:

11

QUESTION:

Oh, the Federal circuit did, yes.

-- thinking that 6 had nothing to do

12

with the PTO's concern, but if the PTO did have a concern

13

and insisted on the number 6 being put in, approximately

14

6, that concern was different than the prior art ruled out

15

a patent or a number higher than 9.

16

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

There are two different

17

reasons.

18

come down no longer than 9, and another reason for

19

insisting that it come down no lower than 6.

There's one reason for insisting that the patent

QUESTION:

Higher than that?

21

MR. TARANTO:

22

Prior art was the reason to say, exclude

Higher than 6.

23

everything above 9.

24

the patent would have been invalid if it had been below 6

25

is that a claim may not be broader than the specification

Another equally important reason why

discloses that the process works.
You look at this specification, in which Hilton

3

Davis laid out all the experiments it had done, nowhere

4

does it show how to make its process work.

QUESTION:

What would happen if - - this is a

hypothetical case, not this case.

in that case?

The inventor says,

alleged infringer still saves money if he goes under 6

16

than salting, but it isn't as good as 6 and 9.

17

MR. TARANTO:

Right.

It's much better

I think that, as you say,

18

that would be a hypothetical, since as the inventor here

19

specifies --

20

QUESTION:

Let's

21

MR. TARANTO:

-- this is a hypothetical.

Right.

It partly depends on what

22

the purpose of the process is.

If the purpose of the

23

process is not just to filter a little bit of solution but

24

is, as the inventor testified here, the whole purpose is

25

to create an economical way of doing it in industrial

1

quantities, then foaming problems would simply not serve

2

that -- would defeat that purpose, and at that point the

3

patent wouldn't be useful for that purpose.

4

But what the examiner and the applicant would be

5

discussing in that situation is whether the utility

6

requirement of the statute is met in those conditions, and

7

that would -- I don't know how exactly that discussion

8

would come out, but our point is that that's the proper

9

place for the discussions.

10

QUESTION:

Is that a proper use of purpose?

I

11

mean, you mean there are two different purposes?

12

purpose is to filter efficiently and another purpose is to

13

filter inefficiently, do you get a separate patent for

14

filtering inefficiently?

15

MR. TARANTO:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

If one

No, I - -

Don't both patents have the same

purpose, namely, of filtering?
MR. TARANTO:

Right.

I was, I guess, using the

19

term purpose there in the sense of function from the

20

language of function-way-result that has often been used

21

as the touchstone for equivalents analysis.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, I mean that.

You think that for

equivalents analysis it would make a difference whether -MR. TARANTO:

Well, I'm in the position of being

uncertain exactly what does make a difference.

I mean,

1

the function-way-result test has often been said,

2

including by Judge Hand, as just another way of stating

3

the problem.

4

judges in the Federal circuit indicated that the function­

5

way- result test was not a terribly satisfactory way to

6

proceed, and the basis --

7

I think it is right that every one of the

QUESTION:

But if you don't have the equivalents

8

doctrine, then, in the example that you and I have just

9

discussed you have to do one of two things, limit your

10

patent to the most efficient range, or (b) -- and suffer

11

infringers, and suffer alleged infringers, or (b) expand

12

the patent to an inefficient zone.

13

MR. TARANTO:

14

QUESTION:

15

Right, and I --

And it seems to me the equivalents

doctrine protects against that.

16

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I -- let me try to answer

that.

18

getting the extra range just because it's inefficient.

19

The question would be whether the requirements for

20

patentability are met, and there are lots of patents that

21

are not even improvements over prior things or

22

particularly efficient, but are novel and nonobvious and

23

useful in the sense of the statute, so efficiency is not a

24

requirement.

What I meant to say is, there wouldn't be a bar on

1

process worked, that it actually performed the function

2

for which it was trying to get the patent, it surely would

3

have written its claim to include that.

4

QUESTION:

By bypass --

Mr. Taranto, on your fallback

5

position where you're talking about the PTO insisting on a

6

limit, how much kind of analogy to legislative history are

7

we letting ourselves in for there?

8

clear why the PTO does what it does?

9

MR. TARANTO:

Is it always perfectly

No, I think not, and I think

10

that's a principal reason why our position is that looking

11

behind the insistence on a limit for the reason for that

12

insistence is not a good idea in an infringement action

13

because it often will not be clear --

14

QUESTION:

Well, can you always find, in the PTO

15

history, the insistence on a limit?

16

ultimately accepted by the patent applicant, can you

17

always find that that was as a result of the insistence of

18

the PTO?

19

MR. TARANTO:

Supposing a limit is

I think always would be too

20

strong.

There will be many, many cases in which the

21

applicant -- you have the original application.

22

examiner says, I reject it for the following reasons, and

23

writes an explanation, so that the task of interpreting

24

those documents to see, not what the reason for the

25

rejection is, but that there was a demand in order to

The

1

obtain the patent for a certain limit to be placed in,

2

that is something that, like other kinds of textual

3

interpretation, sometimes will generate disputes but very

4

often will not, as here it did not.

5

It's another thing entirely to look behind --

6

once you've concluded the PTO said there must be this

7

lower limit, there's no dispute about that, to then

8

second-guess whether the PTO should have insisted on that

9

limited by reexamining the reasons, and what happens, I

10

think, is when you don't have the PTO there as a party,

11

which you would in the internal appeal in the infringement

12

action, you have mistakes being made.

13

The Federal circuit here simply ignored --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, perhaps I should ask

15

your opponent this rather than you, but if it was

16

essential that there be a lower limit on the pH, how can

17

it be that the injunction takes away the lower limit

18

entirely, if I read it correctly?

19

MR. TARANTO:

Right, it does, and we've

20

scratched our heads about that as well.

21

think what happened as a factual matter is that

22

independently of Hilton Davis, Warner-Jenkinson, before it

23

even learned of the patent, figured out how to do this

24

process with a different chemistry that made it able to

25

use a lower pH.

is, the court of appeals seems to think 5.0 is equivalent

QUESTION:

Makes no - - but then the district

court seemed to think 0.0 would also be equivalent.

Is

that a fair reading of the fact they granted that relief?
MR. TARANTO:

10

I think that is a fair reading of

11

what the district court -- what the district court did,

12

yes.

13

Now, our broader point is that in fact the

14

erasing of a limit that was imposed in the PTO after

15

internal correction mechanisms are bypassed is really only

16

the most extreme application of the Federal circuit's

17

broad doctrine of equivalents, which suffers from the same

18

basic problem.

1

It broadly undermines the statute's fundamental

20

decision that it is in the PTO that patentees are supposed

21

to define their asserted inventions, with any needed

22

breadth and flexibility of language to be negotiated

23

there, so that the resulting patent has boundaries that

24

have been approved by the PTO and that give reliable

25

notice of the monopolized territory.

QUESTION:

1

What does that do to Graver and to

2

the cases that it relied on, going way back into the 1 th

3

Century?

4

MR. TARANTO:

Well, let me talk about Graver in

5

particular.

I think that the principle of the statute can

6

be summarized as a principle of disclosure through

7

approved claims.

8

requirement of disclosure, that somebody sitting down,

Graver did not depart from the basic

other inventors trying to work in the same field,
10

competitors, by reading the documents, including with the

11

knowledge of skilled people who understand the terms, but

12

by reading the documents can determine where the

13

boundaries are, because in Graver, there was actual

14

disclosure, not in the remaining valid claim, but both in

15

the broader invalid claim and in the specification of what

16

the defendant was doing.

17

There was no problem there either of bypassing

18

the PTO process of approval, or of not disclosing some

1

kind of equivalent later determined in court to be

20

scientifically unimportant in its change.

21

That would -- seems to us, is the basic rule

22

that ought to apply in limiting any doctrine of

23

equivalents.

24
25

Before Graver, I think it is right to say that,
with one arguable exception, this Court had not expanded

any patent claims for -- in this century, and that Graver

was well recognized at the time as a -- an anomaly in that

situation.

When you begin to talk abut a case on

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

I think that the portion of

Graver that needn't be touched at all, and that is that

16

our position doesn't affect at all, is the requirement

17

that if there's going to be an equivalent so as to expand

the patent's scope beyond the understandable meaning of

the claims, then it can't go beyond what is disclosed.

reliable boundaries of the patent monopoly.

And if it's an undisclosed equivalent, an

so far as I'm aware have just said that something

comparable as it would fit within your particular system
should be recognized in order to afford the protection,

Japan, which for the first time recognized and applied a

I think if we look at the record in this case we

find one peculiarity, although I don't think this Court

intentional surrender of claim coverage, is a question of

law, normally.

The Federal circuit has found

In this case, however, the parties agreed to

submit that question to the jury, and an instruction was

given to the jury on prosecution history estoppel. It

appears on page 60 of the Joint Appendix, and it

essentially asks the jury to consider the reasons why

QUESTION:

10

MR. SCHMIT:

QUESTION:

Yes.
And so if that isn't done, it seems

12

to me that it makes the use of the doctrine of equivalents

13

to cover something like that questionable.

14

MR. SCHMIT:

The statutory scheme for a

15

reissuance exists to correct defects in patents where the

16

patent owner recognizes there's something defective in the

17

patent, either because they have misstated something, or

18

they realized they didn't claim as much as they had --

19

QUESTION:

Well, that's this case.

They now

20

want to assert something they didn't claim, which is a pH

21

below 6.

22

MR. SCHMIT:

But the difference in reissuance

23

is, it permits you to enlarge the scope of the claim

24

within the 2-year statutory period.

Right.

MR. SCHMIT:

1

The doctrine of equivalents

2

operates on a different premise, and that is that you're

3

not enlarging the scope of the claim.

4

is substituting equivalents for what you have literally

5

claimed.

Let me provide an analogy.

All you are doing

Synonyms.

we aren't enlarging the scope of the --

10

QUESTION:

We have a

We have synonyms to that word,
If we substitute one for the other,

Yes, but it's very different here,

11

where there's been a specified range of the pH, and Hilton

12

Davis wants to claim that something that isn't within that

13

scope is nonetheless protected.

14

MR. SCHMIT:

And if we are to have the doctrine

15

of equivalents, it says that we have the right to include

16

within our patent not only that which we have expressly,

17

literally claimed, but all those things which are

18

equivalent because of insubstantial differences.

19

In this case, there was the additional issue --

20

QUESTION:

But it's very hard to conclude that

21

it's insubstantial when it's outside the limits that the

22

patent owner has agreed to have.

23

MR. SCHMIT:

But I think that's the very reason

24

that the doctrine of equivalents exists, so that the

25

patent owner is not forced to only have as coverage and to

QUESTION:

As a condition of the grant, yes.
Why don't you look at page 107 of the

had been made above showing four major points of

difference, coupled with an amendment in claim 1 inserting

the pH range from 6 to 9.

MR. SCHMIT:

MR. SCHMIT:

13

What the claim has to do is, it has

14

to enable a person of ordinary skills in the art to

The question is, have you taught in your patent

enough to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to

that 5 will work, as they must in order to apply the

goodness, we're supposed to advise clients, and we have no

know with this doctrine people might discover all kinds of

do it, and so what we're groping for, is there then no

I mean, how do you prevent it from becoming so

uncertain an element that it becomes impossible to advise

the client?

to say that when the client asks for the advice, you take

clarify your opening statement?

It is your view that

that that was one question for this Court to decide.

7

It does not appear to be.

The requirement of being disclosed

in the patent, first, the doctrine of equivalents is an

objective inquiry.

To require disclosure in the patent

11

makes it into a subjective inquiry, what does the patentee

12

know, rather than what the person who has ordinary skill

13

in the art know.

We also have a practical problem.

the culpability of the alleged infringer.

Mr. Taranto was getting at was, in order to have an

We talked earlier about culpability being relevant.

22

24

There was a time

Yes.
What about designing around a patent?

Is that a plus or a minus?
MR. SCHMIT:

It's a factor to be considered.

QUESTION:

1

2

And which way does it cut, is what

I'm asking?

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. SCHMIT:

What the Federal circuit teaches

5

us, as implied from Graver, that if a patentee -- if an

6

accused infringer makes an attempt to design around the

7

patent there is an inference to be drawn by the trier of

8

fact that they have attempted to incorporate substantial
changes.

10

It's merely an inference, so it's merely one

factor that can be considered in the whole - QUESTION:

11

I'm still not quite clear whether

12

you're saying it's a plus or a minus.

13

favors the infringer, or favors the patentee?

14

MR. SCHMIT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHMIT:

17
18

Is it a factor that

It favors the infringer if -Yes.
-- they make the attempt to design

around it.
QUESTION:

And that's clear from the Fifth

1

Circuit model instructions.

20

approved the model instructions on infringement, and it

21

does say that designing around is a factor in favor of the

22

alleged infringer, just as copying is a factor in favor of

23

the patentee.

The Fifth Circuit has

24

MR. SCHMIT:

25

I didn't mean to imply from culpability that the

That's true.

That's true.

1

subjective intent of the infringer should be a factor.

2

This is an objective test, and whether or not the

3

infringer intended to infringe or did not intend to

4

infringe is irrelevant, as I think Colonial Oil teaches.

5

QUESTION:

But the irony is, he tries to get

6

something that's commercially useful and as close to the

7

patent as is lawful, and that's designing around in a way.

8

In another way, it's copying.

9

the two is kind of fuzzy.

10

MR. SCHMIT:

I mean, the line between

What the infringer must do then is

11

to make substantial changes, which I think benefits

12

everybody, because now, instead of little, incremental

13

changes, you have big changes in technology, and I think

14

that benefits everyone.

15

Thank you very much.

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

Thank you, Mr. Schmit.

MR. TARANTO:

If I could make a couple of quick

21

points, the estoppel point I think, set out at page 28 and

22

29 of our petition, is, I think, widely recognized as the

23

single most important limit in defining the scope of the

24

doctrine of equivalents.

25

QUESTION:

But it really wasn't in the questions

presented.

I mean, that's the major problem I have with

2

that issue.

3

MR. TARANTO:

4

to be in the question presented.

5

said whether infringement should always be available based

6

on a mere finding of substantial difference.

7

and the first primary limit we suggested was prosecution

8

history estoppel as part of 28 and 29.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I guess I - - we intended it
The question presented

We said no,

This is in your petition?

10

MR. TARANTO:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

It is 28 --

Even though the accused product or

12

process is outside the literal scope of the claim.

13

don't see where it refers to prosecution history.

14

MR. TARANTO:

I

Right, it did not use that label.

15

Prosecution history estoppel comes up only when you have a

16

defendant's product that is outside the literal terms of

17

the patent, otherwise there's nothing to estop, otherwise

18

you have literal infringement, so it is in every text the

19

essential limit in defining the scope of the doctrine of

20

equivalents.

21

The important thing that has happened now to the

22

doctrine of equivalents is that it has become the rule,

23

rather than the exception.

24

a substantial differences standard other inventors, who

25

often do make important incremental changes working in the

What that means is that under

same field, don't know where the boundaries are that they

can work, and here a boundary was set at 6.

The examiner explicitly, at page 107, referring

4

to 10 -- to page 22 of the Joint Appendix, said, the

5

reason is that's all that's enabled in the specification,

6

exactly as in the -- in all of this Court's prior cases.

7

QUESTION:

But there's no disagreement on the

8

estoppel history question, as in the abstract.

9

you assert -- it's presented here, both sides agree

10

there's such a thing --

MR. TARANTO:

QUESTION:

The way

I know, and I

--as estoppel history.

They just

disagree as to whether such estoppel occurred here.
MR. TARANTO:

I don't think so.

I think there

15

are two fundamental legal disagreements.

16

circuit said, we've reexamined the reason, and then it

17

said, we discount all reasons except prior art.

18

legally incorrect, and if we change those and say the

19

reason doesn't matter, there was a demand, and second,

20

that even if you do look at the reason, invalidity for

overbreadth is no worse than prior art.
