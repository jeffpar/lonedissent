ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. STOVALL

8

ON BEHALF OF KANSAS

9
10

GENERAL STOVALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Throughout the decades, the States have

11
12

developed three basic ways to deal with persons who commit

13

sex crimes:

14

sentencing, and the law that you have before you today,

15

Kansas's Sexually Violent Predator law, which is a hybrid

16

of both.

17

his 40-year history of sexually molesting children.

18

criminal punishment, treatment in lieu of

Leroy Hendricks has experienced all three during

It was the goal of the Kansas legislature by

19

providing for treatment subsequent to punishment that we

20

could succeed where the other procedures have failed,

21

enabling Kansas to reduce the risk that Leroy Hendricks

22

poses to our children.

23

The civil commitment of sex offenders who suffer

24

from a mental condition linked to their sex crimes has

25

been approved by this Court on two prior occasions, by

1

Pearson in 1940 and Allen in 1986.
The Court's guidance in what is the

2

3

constitutional minimal for an acceptable level of mental

4

condition for commitment is found in the Addington

5

decision, wherein the Court proscribed confinement for

6

merely idiosyncratic behavior, or conduct that is not

7

within the generally acceptable bounds of conduct.

8

no one would argue that Leroy Hendricks was engaging in

9

merely idiosyncratic behavior.

10

QUESTION:

General Stovall, may I ask you

11

whether -- how you fit this kind of a law into any

12

situation with which we have previously dealt?

13

to be kind of a new category of --

14

GENERAL STOVALL:

It seems

Only insofar as that we

have --

future, do you think, if we uphold it?

a mental abnormality of some kind, not mentally ill, and

future?

GENERAL STOVALL:

1

I think, Justice O'Connor, as

2

long as the State could show that there's a medical

3

justification for a diagnosis and that we can show

4

dangerousness -QUESTION:

5
6

Not of mental illness, but of some

kind of mental aberration or personality disorder.

7

GENERAL STOVALL:

Well, the term mental illness

8

is one that this Court has certainly used in its decisions

9

but never defined and, in fact, in Addington, where the

10

language of mental illness was used, the Court also used

11

mental disorder, mental disease, emotional disorder,

12

emotional disturbance, almost synonymously and

13

interchangeably, and so I would submit the mental

14

abnormality that Kansas has in our statute is not

15

different from those things that you have previously

16

approved.

17

QUESTION:

Well, General Stovall, don't you

18

think in using those terms in our opinions we are

19

certainly lay people from a medical point of view, and

20

they probably are not used in any strict medical sense.

21

GENERAL STOVALL:

And I'm a lay person in that

22

regard, too, Your Honor, but when you look, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, at the DSM, where we -- where the psychiatric

24

profession describes particular kinds of condition, the

25

things that the medical community tends to understand

1

would fit within this definition would be two paraphilias,

2

which are pedophilia and sexual sadism, which are terms

3

that have been recognized by the community and still would

4

fit within this definition.

5

QUESTION:

General Stovall, can I clarify that

6

you are not trying to -- you're not suggesting that this

7

Court ought to establish some kind of national standard

8

for what is mental illness or mental abnormality.

9

those definitions been left to the States?

10

GENERAL STOVALL:

Haven't

Justice Ginsburg, that's

11

exactly right, and that's what the State of Kansas would

12

ask us -- ask you to do, so long as we still have a mental

13

justification, a medical justification for commitment and

14

we show dangerousness.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I take it that even the DSM

16

says that these categories have no real operational

17

consistency, and that you look to the diagnosis or the

18

prognosis on a case-by-case basis after clinical

19

evaluation.

20

GENERAL STOVALL:

That's true, Justice Kennedy,

21

and in fact the DSM in the beginning of the introduction

22

part says that this was not created for legal use or for

23

forensic meaning, but it's to aid the psychiatric

24

profession in making some diagnosis that they then can

25

apply to this definition in the Kansas statute of mental

1

abnormality.
QUESTION:

2

You begin by saying, and this was

3

part of Justice O'Connor's line of questioning, too, that

4

this is a hybrid between a criminal statute and a civil

5

statute.

6

that --

7

I should think, and correct me if I'm wrong,

GENERAL STOVALL:

It's a hybrid -- I'm sorry.

8

It's a hybrid between criminal sentencing and treatment in

9

lieu of punishment, but it's clearly a civil commitment.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, and I was going to say it seems

11

to me that your argument in your brief at least is one in

12

which you can justify this statute strictly as a civil

13

commitment.

14

If your statutory scheme were changed somewhat

15

and you had an adequate prognosis of dangerous sexual

16

behavior, civil commitment could follow under your

17

argument, I take it.

18

GENERAL STOVALL:

Yes.

In fact, this Court has

19

specifically approved in Baxstrom in 1966 being able to

20

civilly commit mentally ill inmates at the conclusion of

21

their prison sentence, and so this is no different than

22

what you have approved previously, except that we have

23

crafted out a very specific mental commitment statute for

24

this particular group of offenders.

25

QUESTION:

And also that there's no difference

1

in this man than there was the day he went into prison.

2

That's what's unusual about this, isn't it?

3

this category of having a mental abnormality, he's no more

4

or less abnormal at the time he finishes his criminal

5

sentence than he was the day he began to serve it.

6

GENERAL STOVALL:

If he is in

Justice Ginsburg, that would

7

be true for Leroy Hendricks, who certainly is the

8

respondent here, but Kansas in our prison system has the

9

ability and, in fact, requires inmates that are convicted

10

of sex offenses to go through treatment, so they do have

11

the ability while receiving treatment in prison to shed

12

themselves not of the diagnosis of pedophilia, for

13

example, but of the later part of the definition, which is

14

being likely to continue to engage in predatory acts of

15

sexual violence, because they've gone through treatment.

16

And so we have seen that happen, that if they

17

complete treatment, they might not have the abnormality on

18

the inside, whereas your question was, are they going to

19

come in with it.

20

they're in, so if they come in with one, then they will

21

have that before they enter the prison --

They're not going to develop one while

22

QUESTION:

Well, I --

23

QUESTION:

Do you have some studies that we

24
25

could refer to to support that?
My impression was that the psychiatrists cannot

1

really, or clinicians, certify the patient as being

2

unlikely to repeat unless they observe him in a normal

3

environment, and he's not in a normal environment when

4

he's in prison, so it's just somewhat circular.

5

GENERAL STOVALL:

There are many studies that

6

were cited in our brief, Justice Kennedy.

7

to mind talk about the efficacy of treatment of a

8

cognitive behavioral-based treatment which is what we

9

provide, and that is certainly the state of the art now in

10
11

Two that come

the psychiatric community for sex offenders.
One study would show that people that went

12

through treatment had an 8-percent rate of recidivism,

13

whereas people that didn't go through had a 20-percent

14

rate, and that was coming out of a State hospital in

15

California, so it was a confined environment.

16

QUESTION:

I --

Is 8 percent high enough?

I mean,

17

what if the State says, you know, 8 percent is still too

18

high a risk?

19

more of these offenses does the State release these

20

individuals?

21

At what percentage of unlikelihood to commit

GENERAL STOVALL:

Justice Scalia, that would be

22

a question for the judge and jury to decide.

23

psychiatric professional would have to make the

24

determination.

know?

Is there no chance that this individual will commit

2

acts of these -- of this sort again if he's released, or

3

is there an 8-percent chance, or a -- what do you tell the

4

jury?

5

GENERAL STOVALL:

The jury instructions in

6

Kansas just simply ask them to find whether or not he is

7

likely to continue to engage in predatory acts of sexual

8

violence.

9
10

The testimony at the trial -QUESTION:

Likely.

What was that, 49 percent

would not do it?
GENERAL STOVALL:

11

I would be willing to assert

12

that it's 51 percent, Justice Scalia, and the testimony at

13

the trial --

14

QUESTION:

That's pretty generous.

If it's, you

15

know, 51-49 that he'll continue to do this you let him

16

lose.

17

GENERAL STOVALL:

There has been no

18

determination as to what percent that is, and we don't

19

give that guidance to the jury in Kansas, but Dr. Befort,

20

who testified at the sex predator trial, testified in his

21

view that -- he was saying that Mr. Hendricks would

22

reoffend within a 51-percent chance.

23

QUESTION:

Well, you don't define reasonable

24

doubt in criminal cases in terms of 15 percent, or 12

25

percent.

We've never required that sort of precision.

That's true, Mr. Chief

Justice, and we don't give any more of that decision

within our statute as well, but --

QUESTION:

will not be effective?

puts on psychiatric testimony that says, you know, you can

talk about treating this all you like, but there's no

What if the convicted defendant

What Kansas has done is to

10

provide for treatment, and I think that's all that we have

11

to do, and not show that Mr. Hendricks, for example -QUESTION:

12

Even when treatment is ineffective.

13

You generously provide for treatment when there's no

14

reason to think the treatment's going to do any good.

Let me clarify, Justice

Do you mean for the particular person being -QUESTION:

For the particular person.

Suppose

18

the evidence is clear that, yes, he will do it again if

19

he's released, but treatment is not going to help that at

20

all.
GENERAL STOVALL:

21

I think in that case we still

have the ability to commit an individual, because we're

providing for the treatment.

I can understand that.

But I

10

if we provide treatment, even though it's entirely clear

11

that treatment will do entirely no good.

12

GENERAL STOVALL:

The Court has never required,

13

in my understanding, for a State to be able to show that a

14

cure is guaranteed for somebody or that they will

15

necessarily benefit from it, and so --

16

QUESTION:

But that's not necessarily this case,

17

I take it, because you're at least claiming that this man

18

is treatable to some degree.

19

you're claiming that there is some treatability in his

condition, isn't that correct?

GENERAL STOVALL:

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Justice Souter.

Now -- so that in the challenge that

we've got before us we would not, in order to hold your

it in Foucha, because of two things.

2

Number 1, it fell into at least a recognized

3

psychiatric category, which gets us away from a purely

4

idiosyncratic judgment about one individual's

dangerousness, and it is a treatable condition, and that's

all you would need to win.

dangerousness as well.

QUESTION:

So we could -- if we ruled your way

14

we could leave for another day the question of what to do

15

under, we'll say, the Foucha rule, in a case in which

16

there was a recognized psychiatric category of abnormality

17

but one that was totally untreatable, one that was

permanent.

Nothing could be done about it.

I would agree with that.

So you don't have to have as broad a

rule as you were speaking -QUESTION:

It is

them to commit maladaptive behavior.

it's sexual behavior.

In addition to that --

What kind of treatment is that?

think differently, or what is the treatment?

I

Are you trying to train people to

GENERAL STOVALL:

Part of it does have to do

with stopping those thinking patterns, helping them

10

identify, for one thing, what their thinking patterns are

11

that are maladaptive and not like the rest of us, and then

12

how to stop the behavior, how to stop the thinking

13

patterns from leading directly into that behavior, and

14

there is certainly some level of behavior modification in

15

the program.

16

They receive 31-1/2 hours of treatment per week.

QUESTION:

1
2

I mean -- you know, correct me if

that's wrong.

3

GENERAL STOVALL:

The definition of mental

4

abnormality in our Kansas statute is that it is a

5

congenital or an acquired condition, and that --

6

QUESTION:

But that's not cognitive.

7

GENERAL STOVALL:

You're correct, Justice 0 --

8

Justice Kennedy.

The treatment is a combination of both

9

cognitive restructuring as well as behavior modification,

10

and so they need to initially be able to identify the

11

cognitive -- the thinking distortions that occur instead

12

of just -- like, 30 years ago all we would have done is

13

sort of the 12-step addiction model, try to deal with the

14

behavior and not the thought processes that preceded that

15

behavior.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about this

statute and what the State's position is?
The statute defines a sexually violent predator

19

as a person who has been convicted or charged with a

20

sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental

21

abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person

22

likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.

23

Would this statute be constitutional, in your

24

view, if it left out the requirement that there be a prior

25

conviction, if it were like the Illinois statute on which

you rely?

Just, they come in with an indictment of this

2

and say, in addition we think he's likely to do it in the

3

future.

Would that be constitutional?

4
5

GENERAL STOVALL:

I think so, Justice Stevens,

what Kansas has chosen to do, though -QUESTION:

6

So really the prior convictions are

7

GENERAL STOVALL:

QUESTION:

I think it's --

I'm sorry.

At least for purposes of

the case that you've brought to us it would be sufficient

7

to decide the case, I suppose, on the mental illness

ground to say that this was a treatable condition and

9

therefore qualified as mental illness within the meaning

10

of the term in Foucha, and that implies treatability, I

11

presume.

12

And I suppose the treatability in a way is kind

13

of a quid pro quo for the capacity of the State to lock

14

somebody up, so that if we went no further than the Foucha

15

rule and no further than the rule that would cover the

16

case that you've brought to us this morning, I would

17

suppose that a failure or a refusal to treat would be

18

grounds for release.

19

Would you agree with that?

GENERAL STOVALL:

And Mr. Hendricks' certainly

20

would have the ability to file a habeas action in either

locking him up, or the reason for locking him up is that

he's a danger to others, and that treatability bears on

the fairness of the conditions of his confinement.

is to say, it is thought that it is unfair to confine him

Is that the underlying rationale?

GENERAL STOVALL:

I think that that's correct,

that that's -- the decisions have indicated by some

justices that there need to be some level of treatment and

It is somewhat, although for

the last 60 years States have been dealing with a way to

be able to civilly detain sex offenders in particular.

5

They've not looked to do that for arsonists or others, but

6

in the -- in 1940 this Court approved the Pearson decision

that did allow for commitment of someone with a sex

offense.

9

But I think Justice O'Connor in the beginning

asked the question that I think relates to this, and that

11

is, I think as long as a State can demonstrate that there

is a medically justified condition and that there is a

manifestation of a threat to be the dangerousness element,

that a State probably could do that if there was some

kinds of issues that you look at in making this decision.

trying to argue.

condition of pedophilia and whether that is open to the

State to include within the broad concept of some kind of

mental illness.

9

MR. WEILERT:

Pedophilia, as I understand it, is

10

diagnosed based upon prior commission of criminal acts.

11

If pedophilia was sufficient to form the basis for a civil

12

commitment, then any other act such as Justice Breyer was

different than an antisocial personality.
QUESTION:

2

Well, suppose you had a paranoid

3

schizophrenia acute type, and the diagnosis was that the

4

person was dangerous to himself and to others, could you

5

commit there?
MR. WEILERT:

6

That would be acceptable under the

7

normal civil commitment statute, Your Honor, where the

8

commitment is based upon the inability of the person to

9

take care of themselves and make rational decisions about

10

their treatment, and then because the commitment is for

11

the person's own good, he can be civilly committed.

Well, rationality is not a part of

the civil commitment preconditions.

MR. WEILERT:

Generally, in --

QUESTION:

3

Well, the supreme court of Kansas,

4

Mr. Weilert, in its opinion, which upheld your -- the

5

majority upheld your point of view, said the State could

6

get around -- could handle it by simply imposing a life

7

sentence on these people and there would be no

constitutional problem.
Does that really solve any problem to say that

10

the State can't do what it does here but it can come back

11

and impose a life sentence on a person for the first

pedophilic offense?

the State can make under its criminal -- or, criminal

powers.

17

with that, but even in this case there are a number of

things the State can do other than commit some person for

committed.

It's a restriction of his physical

liberty.
MR. WEILERT:

It's a restriction of his liberty,

10

but it's not a confinement that is a massive curtailment

11

of that liberty, and I believe that's the distinction,

12

QUESTION:

But life imprisonment certainly would

be, and one of the arguments that the State makes is,

But surely that would be manipulable,

too, if that is to be part of the test, if the parole

MR. WEILERT:

Well, certainly the parole

authorities would have to have some discretion, but it

would be -- it would not be manipulative in the same way

that the States could formulate a plan to commit persons

provides that opportunity.

v. Louisiana.

We would suggest that the primary reason for the

incarceration of persons who were being released from

confinement following their conviction and sentence on

sexual offenses.

was to continue incarceration and that treatment was

incidental at best.

about timing, and suppose Mr. Hendricks is charged,

That was a procedural claim, Your

13

type -- Kansas could make the decision at the time of the

original conviction to go to a sexual psychopath type law,

much as it could have done back in 1984 when Kansas did

have such a law in effect.

Your Honor, I don't believe there

QUESTION:

Everyone agrees with that, I think.

11

The issue is, in addition, you have to be mentally ill,

12

and it's like civil commitment, and how do you decide

13

whether for legal purposes a person is sufficiently

14

mentally ill?

15

I suppose there are some people who are very

16

dangerous, whom every psychiatrist would say are crazy

17

beyond a doubt and are going to murder 15 other people

18

unless they're locked up, and I'm assuming that it would

19

be possible to lock up that person, but not lock up

20

somebody who commits a lot of crimes, whom every

21

psychiatrist would say there's nothing wrong with except

22

he's a sociopath, which means he commits a lot of crimes,

23

all right.

24
25

I take that as an assumption.
So what's the definition distinguishing the one

from another, and what I'm going to ask you about is the

1

ALI's definition, which had for a different purpose to say

2

that a person was insane if, as a result in part of a

3

mental defect, he lacked substantial capacity, in this

4

case it would be to conform his conduct to the

5

requirements of law, which would suggest a kind of

6

irresistible impulse, a compulsion.

7

And we know that there is in one of the

8

psychiatric associations' brief evidence that some

9

psychiatrists call this a kind of compulsion, so is the

10

ALI test a possible test?

11

some psychiatrists saying this is somewhat compulsive, and

12

others saying not, what do we do?

13

QUESTION:

If not, what is, and if we have

I think your response is that we

14

tried this test for criminal conviction and it turned out

15

to be a mess.

16

better for psychiatric commitment?

17

to get somebody to come in with evidence on one or the

18

other side of that irresistible compulsion rule.

19

courts adopted that for criminal -- for insanity defenses

20

and it turned out to be chaos.

Is there any reason it's likely to be

I believe that is correct, Justice

Scalia and Justice Breyer.
QUESTION:

It's always possible

So your view, then, is that you could

24

not lock up a person whom every psychiatrist would say has

25

a totally uncontrollable compulsion to murder people, and

1

they want civilly to commit him -- civilly to commit him,

2

as -- or a person who's going to kill herself, or himself,

3

uncontrollable impulse, though the person otherwise seems

4

rational.

5

We could not civilly commit such a person?
MR. WEILERT:

In that circumstance, Your Honor,

6

I believe that the civil commitment might be appropriate

7

because it would be for the good of the person being

8

committed to prevent him from killing himself and for the

9

protection of society, but it would be based upon the

10

original finding that the civil commitment had to be based

11

upon a mental illness rather than simply the prior

12

commission of a crime.

13

QUESTION:

In any event, you agree with General

14

Stovall, don't you, that this matter of what the mental

15

state is, subject to constitutional limitations, is for

16

the State to decide, and the State here has defined

17

something called mental abnormality that's short of mental

18

illness?

19

MR. WEILERT:

I believe that the State has

20

latitude in deciding whatever the condition is for civil

21

commitment so long as it is something more than just a

22

condition based upon the prior commission of crime and the

23

risk of commission of crime again in the future.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what's the ethical calculus

that makes the dangerousness to oneself so much of a

1

higher order of priority than dangerous to 10 other

2

people?
MR. WEILERT:

3
4

mean to do so.

I believe that danger --

QUESTION:

5

I -- if I stated that I did not

Well, I mean, that's the logical

6

consequence of your answer that you must find that it's in

7

the person's own welfare, and I suppose we could say it's

8

in your own welfare to prevent you from committing crimes,

9

but leaving that aside, you seem to say it must be in the

10

patient's own welfare to be committed before there can be

11

a civil commitment.
MR. WEILERT:

12

13
14
15
16
17

I believe that's correct,

because -QUESTION:

I'm asking you why that is so.

Why

is that so?
MR. WEILERT:

Because the person is unable to

care for themselves.

18

QUESTION:

But what's the reason for --

19

QUESTION:

Why limit it to that?

20

MR. WEILERT:

If we do not limit it to that, I

21

believe we then -- there's no logical stopping place where

22

we can say that a commitment for dangerousness alone would

23

not be sufficient, and --

25

QUESTION:

Well, what about Justice Breyer's

example of someone who's said by every psychiatrist who

has seen him, if he's at large he's going to murder

people?

3

civilly committed?
MR. WEILERT:

5

Now, do you say that person can or cannot be

Well, as I understand the ALI

definition -QUESTION:

6

Well, no, I'm not talking about the

7

ALI.

I'm just asking, all the psychiatrists find a person

8

is going to -- if he's at large he's going to murder

9

people.

Now, can that person be civilly committed?

10

MR. WEILERT:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Based on that alone?

I --

Well, and that it's a form of mental

illness, as one would hope they would find.
MR. WEILERT:

Your Honor, I believe we would be

14

treading on very thin ice, because that in effect is

15

allowing for a commitment based upon what someone might do

16

in the future, and it would have to be based upon a

17

finding of mental illness, which we once again come back

18

to that has to be based upon something more than the

19

commission of the crime in the past and the possibility of

20

committing a crime in the future.

21

QUESTION:

Well, Allen v. Illinois certainly

22

upheld a civil commitment of persons charged with sexual

23

offenses who are sexually dangerous persons suffering from

24

a mental disorder and having criminal propensities to the

25

commission of sex offenders -- offenses, particularly, in

1

that case, sexual molestation of children.
Now, the Court upheld that notion, and referred

2

3

to a mental disorder.

4

that case it was offered as an alternative to

5

incarceration for the criminal offense as opposed to here,

6

where it is proposed subsequent to serving the sentence.

7
8

The only difference was that in

Now, does that make a big difference if it in
fact is a civil commitment?

9

MR. WEILERT:

Your Honor, in Allen the

10

commitment there was in lieu of a criminal prosecution.

11

Here, the State has already had a criminal prosecution,

12

and in Allen the justification the Court gave was that it

13

disavowed -- Allen -- or, pardon me, Illinois disavowed

14

any interest in punishment in lieu of the civil

15

commitment.

16
17

In this case, the same procedure could have
perhaps been used, except the --

18

QUESTION:

I'm just asking you if that one

19

factor should make a difference.

20

MR. WEILERT:

Yes, Your Honor, it should.

21

commitment in Allen was of a person who was -- had a

22

treatable mental illness, a schizophrenic.

23

and it's not at all this situation.

MR. WEILERT:

distinction was that it disavowed punishment.
