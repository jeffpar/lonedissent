ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. HUNT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case was decided incorrectly by the lower

12

courts in two respects.

13

have dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under the

14

Tax Injunction Act.

15

First, the district court should

Second, on the merits, the reliance of the lower

16

courts on a doctrine of implied immunity of production

17

credit associations from State taxation is erroneous when

18

12 U.S.C. section 2077 clearly provides the extent to

19

which production credit associations are exempt from

20

Arkansas or from any State sales and income tax.

21

QUESTION:

I'm curious to know, was the Anti-

22

Injunction Act point, the jurisdictional point argued in

23

the Ninth Circuit -- pardon me, in the Eighth Circuit or

24

in the briefs that were filed?

Respondents are -QUESTION:

12

Well, certainly the courts have

recognized some implied exemptions from that Tax

MS. HUNT:

That is correct, Justice --

QUESTION:

For example, for the NLRB.

I am not aware that in the context of

the Tax Injunction Act there has been an exemption applied

for the NLRB.

21

Injunction Act, to which there is an implied exemption.

If we're going

1

to have an implied exemption, what's the test?
MS. HUNT:

2

Our test that we would like to

3

advocate to the Court is a bright line test.

4

United States appears with the instrumentality to assert

5

its interest then jurisdiction is proper in the district

6

court.

7

QUESTION:

If the

And that's the only instance?

I

8

don't think that's the position of the Government, is it,

9

the Federal Government?

10

MS. HUNT:

I don't believe -- I believe they do

11

disagree with that in some respect.

12

advocacy, though, would lead toward extending the applied

13

exemption to agencies of the Government, as I understand

14

their argument.

15

I believe that their

We make a distinction, we draw a distinction

16

between agencies and instrumentalities.

17

is a much more compelling reason for extending the implied

18

exemption to agencies who would be functioning as arms of

19

the Government, who might be regulating.

20

would certainly be governmental functions in a much

21

greater respect than those of instrumentalities.

22

There are several

QUESTION:

Certainly there

Their functions

Why leave it to the executive branch

24

to decide what's an instrumentality that is deserving of

25

the exemption and what isn't?

boils down to.

2

level, I suppose, the Civil Division of the Department of

3

Justice, decides to argue for immunity under the Tax --

from the Tax Injunction Act, then it wins.

5

doesn't.

6

If the Solicitor General, or at the lower

MS. HUNT:

Otherwise, it

Yes, Your Honor, it does appear that

7

that would be the case.

There is always the provision in

8

the Tax Injunction Act that provides that if an adequate

State remedy does not exist, then the entity can appear in

district court.

11

seeking to assert its interest, then if there is an

12

adequate State remedy, it can assert those interests in

the State court.

If this is an instrumentality who is

QUESTION:

Well, so far as the United States

15

being a party, you're stuck with the decision of the

16

Department of Employment Security.

17

if the United States appears as a party, and you don't

have any trouble with that, I take it.

21

MS. HUNT:

There is an exemption

That is correct, Your Honor.

We

certainly have no problem with that.
Of course, we are advocating a bright line.

We

22

understand that the lower courts have distinguished this

23

bright line and have not adopted that, and that there have

24

been lower court decisions who have looked at the

25

governmental nature, for example, of the instrumentality

1

to determine whether or not it should be allowed to appear

2

on its own behalf.

3

QUESTION:

Your bright line -- I just want to be

4

sure I understand -- is a distinction between an agency

5

and an instrumentality.

6

MS. HUNT:

That is correct.

7

QUESTION:

And what is the difference between

MS. HUNT:

I believe that in most cases an

8

9

the two?

10

agency would be designated by statute as an agency of the

11

Government.

12

They would obviously --

QUESTION:

Suppose the statute had called this

13

entity an agency instead of an instrument?

14

just gave it that name?

15
16

What if they

Would that be enough?

I mean, part of the problem here is we're not
sure the name has any legal significance.

17

MS. HUNT:

The instrumentality --

18

QUESTION:

And I'm just wondering how you know

19

so clearly as to such a bright line that tells us whether

20

it's an instrumentality or an agency.

21

MS. HUNT:

That's what --

That is why we would advocate an even

22

more bright line, actually, and draw the line and say, if

23

any entity appears the United States should appear.

24
25

Perhaps I was not entirely clear in trying to
distinguish between them.

QUESTION:

1

And you would say, then, that Nash-

2

Finch, the NLRB case, deals with the Anti-Injunction Act

3

generally, not with the Tax Injunction Act.

4

MS. HUNT:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

5

there are, too -- there is a difference in the purpose of

6

those two acts that I would also like to distinguish.

7

The purpose of the general Anti-Injunction Act

8

was to prevent conflict between Federal and State courts,

9

whereas the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to limit

10

Federal court jurisdiction when the subject that's being

11

considered is State taxation.

12

the vast importance, the crucial importance to States of

13

their ability to deal with State tax matters that affect

14

them.

15

QUESTION:

This is in recognition of

So you really expect us to hold that

16

if the President is annoyed with the National Labor

17

Relations Board and instructs the Solicitor General or the

18

Civil Division of the Justice Department not to appeal in

19

order to enable that agency to claim the benefit of the

20

exemption from the Anti-Injunction Act, then that's the

21

way it will be?

22

MS. HUNT:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

23

QUESTION:

Regardless of what Congress -- it has

24

nothing to do with Congress' intention to establish the

25

NLRB as an agency of the United States.

It's all up to

1

the executive whether he wants to appear in court or not.
MS. HUNT:

2

Under the bright -- under the

3

absolute bright line test for the presence of the United

4

States, that would be necessary.
QUESTION:

5

As --

Can you tell me why I should do that,

6

why I should leave this issue of law under a congressional

7

statute to be decided dispositively by the President of

8

the United States?
MS. HUNT:

9

Obviously, if the President of the

10

United States, the executive department, examines the

11

entity that it is there to represent and makes this

12

determination to appear, under the bright line test that

13

would be a decision that would be left to the executive

14

department.
As a practical matter, in instances of State

15
16

taxation, I would find it very difficult to think of an

17

example where a State would attempt to tax an agency.

18

State --

19

QUESTION:

What if the President, during the

20

presidency of Franklin Roosevelt the Civil Division does

appear on behalf the labor board and says, this is an

22

agency of the United States.

not to appear.

Is the labor board branded once and

forever as an agency of the United States by reason of the
first appearance under the prior administration, or can it
be undone by the second?
MS. HUNT:
be undone.

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it could

If you are allowing the executive to make that

decision, then it appears that it would be within the
executive's discretion under that test.
Of course, on behalf of the State of Arkansas,
in considering that the entities here are production
credit associations, regardless of whether the Court
adopts a bright line test, and even if the Court should
determine that a much more flexible test is appropriate,
it is our contention that the production credit
associations would fail to meet the standard regardless of
what the test is, even if it's a more flexible
governmental nature of the organization.
QUESTION:

Ms. Hunt, may I ask you a question

about the discrete jurisdictional issue, which this Court
asked the parties to address.

It seems to me that the

answer to the jurisdictional question goes a long way, if
not all the way, to answer the question on the merits as
well.

Would you agree with that, that how you categorize

this agency for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act -MS. HUNT:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

I believe that

1

the tests are different here.
The test for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act

2

3

has not totally been established by this Court.

4

I believe the test for whether or not an instrumentality

5

has been -- tax immunity has been conferred on an

6

instrumentality is determined first of all by looking to

7

whether or not Congress has addressed the issue.
If Congress has clearly addressed the issue of

8

9

However,

tax immunity, then I think that forecloses further inquiry

10

by the Court into the tax exempt status, so in that

11

respect I believe the tests are different.
QUESTION:

12

Why wouldn't it make sense to have

13

the test simply be whether Federal dollars are at stake as

14

the exemption for the Tax Injunction Act?

15

MS. HUNT:

If the only test were whether or not

16

Federal dollars were at stake, there would be many, many

17

entities who would then be entitled to the benefit of the

18

Tax Injunction Act.

19

There are so many entities that in some respect

20

have a stake in Federal money who do not execute agency

21

functions, so in that respect I don't believe that merely

22

the infusion of some sort of Government capital or access

23

to Government capital would be a sufficient test to decide

24

this case.

25

In addition to the other respects, Congress also

has the power to provide an exemption to the Tax

Court construed a statute that had been passed, section 28

U.S.C. 1362 which deals specifically with the Indian

5

tribes, to be an implied exemption to -- not an implied

exemption, but to be a statutory exemption to the Tax

Injunction Act, which was passed sometime after the Tax

8

Injunction Act.

=\

Since this is an implied immunity for the

9

'

For example, in the Moe decision this

benefit of the United States, it is our contention that

11

implied immunity should be strictly construed, and before

12

the Court would extend this implied immunity to another

13

entity, this Court should look very carefully at that

14

extension.

15

QUESTION:

Ms. Hunt, could we borrow a test from

16

somewhere else?

17

that we would apply for sovereign immunity?

18

you sue the labor board you would not get anywhere.

19

don't we just say the same thing, it's any agency that

20

would come under our sovereign immunity rules?

21

What about just applying the same test

MS. HUNT:

You know, if
Why

In the sense of sovereign immunity

22

this has frequently been addressed by statute, by the sue-

23

and-be-sued statutes, so this alone would not be a

24

sufficient test because that might have been spoken to by

25

Congress already, and then you would have to enter into

May I reserve my time for rebuttal?
QUESTION:

Yes, you may, Ms. Hunt.

Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The principle underlying the exception to the
Tax Injunction Act that was recognized in Department of
Employment was described by this Court in 1960 in Federal
Power Commission v. Tuscarora Indian Nation as,

"General

statutes imposing restrictions do not apply to the
Government itself without a clear expression to that
effect," and in 1947 in United States v. United
Mineworkers, instead of to the Government itself the Court
said, will not be applied to the sovereign.
Now, who is the sovereign, or the Government for
this purpose in our modern, complex governmental
framework?

While the term, instrumentality is often used

on the merits of questions of tax immunity, because
obviously the Government itself cannot be taxed, and the
issue is about whether an instrumentality is immune from

QUESTION:

I should have asked, and it's

14

apparent from your question, they are not always

15

designated instrumentalities apparently.

16

MR. WALLACE:

Not always.

Sometimes they're

17

just designated a Government enterprise, but in footnote 8

18

of our brief we try to explain that the same body can be

19

an instrumentality for one purpose but not for another

20

under various holdings.

21

But what is different about an agency from other

22

instrumentalities?

One model for an answer, and these

23

terms are not always used in precisely the same way from

one context to another, but one model for an answer is in

the words themselves.

An agency is related to the law of agency.

6

An

7

agent is someone who shares in the governmental authority,

8

or what we would call the regulatory authority of the

9

Government, and that in our system is at least an

10

important way of looking at it.
Another way of differentiating the group to whom

the exception should extend is whether it is a public

13

governmental body, or a privately owned enterprise.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what about the Red Cross?

I

15

mean, that -- it's hard to look at that as so much a part

16

of the Government that it should share the Government's

exempt status, and yet we have a case where at least when

18

the Government was a coplaintiff it came within the

exception.

Mr. Wallace,

Well,

MR. WALLACE:

There are reasons -- there are

reasons I would hesitate to say it's the same.

instances it would require the Court to address a

MR. HANSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to answer Justice Scalia's question as

16

to what standards ought to apply in determining

17

application of the Tax Injunction act, application of

18

sovereign immunity concepts, application of tax immunity

19

concepts, but I think it really has two pieces.

20

One is that the same standard should apply in

21

determining whether or not an entity is a Federal

22

instrumentality, and the Court's most recent discussion of

23

that is in U.S. v. New Mexico, where they talked about an

24

entity being so closely connected to the Government that

25

it cannot be viewed as a separate party.

this Court involving various farm credit system entities.

4

But I think the other thing they say we need

5

to - - I would like to discuss a bit further.

6

that these entities exist to make profits for their

members, and that simply misconceives the nature of the

farm credit system.

9

They say

When the Federal Land Banks were created back in

10

1916, Congress referred to the farm credit system as a

11

bridge between farmers and the credit markets.

12

the Federal Government cannot provide a mechanism to get

13

adequate credit to farmers, that the commercial banking

14

institutions cannot provide a mechanism to get adequate

15

credit to farmers, so what we will do is, we will provide

16

a federally supported mechanism, and that's all the modern

17

farm credit system does.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hanson, whatever this was

originally when there was a Federal administrator

involved, is there anything that these entities are doing

or whether you ought to go first into State court.
MR. HANSON:

Well, let me contrast perhaps two

different institutions.
You have an independent contractor who is -contracts with the Government to perform a governmental
function.

What this Court has said is that that

contractor is a separate entity pursuing its own private
profit interests, and the fact that it is performing a
function for the Government doesn't make it a Federal
instrumentality, so the fact that a company assists the
National Endowment for the Arts doesn't make it a Federal
instrumentality under U.S. v. New Mexico and the prior
cases.
My point is here that these entities perform no
function except the specific governmental function that
the system was set up to perform.

They have no separate

private existence.
Now, they certainly have private
characteristics, and I admit that.

I mean, they have

officers, and they have directors.

because I think you answered my question candidly that

choose to allow them to do.

MR. HANSON:

Well, they can do only what the

Government allows them to do under the controlling statute

and regulations.

The members have day-to-day control.

But that's the purpose of the system.

expressed by this Court, is to provide credit to farmers.

There's a distinction between the --

a Federal credit union and the PCA's.
MR. HANSON:

There is in the statutory provision

11

describing certain aspects of the tax exemption, but I'm

12

not sure that there's much other than that, and the Sixth

13

Circuit basically compares and contrasts the two and says

14

the only real distinction is one provides financial

15

services to a broader range of the public than the farm

16

credit system does.

17

But the system is probably fairly stated unique.

18

It was formed because there was a congressional

19

determination that this is how the congressional purpose

20

could be accomplished, that the Federal Government can't

21

do it because the farm economy is too complex, that you

22

can't run the system from Washington.

They

said, we can't do this, so what we will do is we will set
up a farmer-supported system, or a federally supported
system, and we will engage the farmers.
Now, that doesn't mean that they get into this
system to make a profit.

It means that if a farmer wants

to borrow money from the system, he has to buy stock, and
it's mandatory.

It's not voluntary, because there is no

profit potential.

It is a cost of entry, in effect, but

it was determined that that way the farmer would be
interested in the success of the associations, the success
of the system as a whole.
So the role of the farmer reflects Congress'
considered decision that this makes sense as a means of an
effective system for delivery of credit, but you know,
it's a closed system, too, except for periodic Government
investment.
When you talk about where the system gets its
"earnings" or its capital, basically that comes from its
members.

QUESTION:

2

MR. HANSON:

Rather than taxpayers, let's say.
They benefit the Government to this

3

extent, and that is that currently, as part of the package

4

of assistance that was provided in 1987, the system owes

5

the Treasury some $600 million, and not only do they owe

6

the Treasury $600 million, but the Government has

7

implicitly guaranteed the system's bonds, and I realize

8

it's not a statutory guarantee, but the market believes

9

that the Government will support those bonds and, of

10

course, it always has.

11

So that any additional expense that you place on

12

the system, potentially at least, increases the likelihood

13

of the Government having to come back.

Do you think there is a pattern in,

MR. HANSON:

Actually, the only pattern is that

was a recodification of the entire act, said the

production credit associations continued to be Federal

talking about why we believe that a bright line rule that

requires that the United States to be -- or the Justice

suing in Federal court we think is inappropriate.

8

The underlying policy, or the underlying reason

9

for Department of Employment, as I understand it, was the

notion that a sovereign should not be viewed as having

relinquished access to its own courts absent a very

explicit surrender.

to say, as -- and this goes back to your question about,

standard for sovereign immunity or not.

wording and in language to the statute that the PCA's had

In fact, that statute is very similar in

prior to the amendment, and at the time that they were

If the statute were exactly the same, then we

would make the argument that because the PCA's are now

In another respect there are many other Federal

17

This is quoting directly from 12 U.S.C.

It is my contention that this designation simply

implies that Congress has the power to create or to allow

19

these farmers to band together and to charter these

20

institutions, because again, on the same page at 12 U.S.C.

21

section 2071(b)(7), there's the same instrumentality

to their taxation, which is printed in the petitioner's
brief on page 2, we again see the instrumentalitylanguage.

Quoting from 2077, each production credit

association and its obligations are instrumentalities of
the United States and as such, going on with the language
of the exemption from tax
It is my contention that that language is there
for a specific purpose, in the first instance to show that
Congress has power to create these institutions, and in
the second to show that Congress has the power to immunize
them to the limited degree that they did from tax, which
leads into the argument on the merits.
The respondents' attempt to apply the doctrine
of McCulloch to this case, there is a very specific reason
why the doctrine of McCulloch does not apply here.

There

was no tax exemption statute in McCulloch which led the
Court to construe the implied immunity.
