ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. MILLER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MILLER:

12

13

The Court

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

The issue presented for review in this case is

15

whether the Eleventh Amendment immunity is lost if the

16

State or a State entity has a claim for indemnification or

17

reimbursement for any judgment entered against it.

18

the potential indemnitor is the United States Department

19

of Energy.

20

Here,

The issue arises in the context of a breach of

21

contract action brought in Federal court on diversity

22

grounds where the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and,

23

thus, the issue does not implicate the question of the

24

scope of the Eleventh Amendment that the Court has focused

25

on in a number of cases, most recently in the Seminole

1

Tribe case of last year, for even under the most narrow

2

view of the scope of the amendment the question presented

3

in this case would need to be addressed.

4

The Ninth Circuit court held that the university

5

lost its immunity in this case because in this particular

6

case it had a claim for indemnification against the United

7

States Department of Energy.
The core error of the court below was its

8

9

premise that in each case involving a State entity the

10

court can consider, and parties can litigate, the question

11

of the payment source that would be used to satisfy a

12

judgment that might be entered in that particular case.

13

Nothing in the Court's Eleventh Amendment cases supports

14

that view, and we believe it is inconsistent with the

15

terms, the meaning, and the purpose of the Eleventh

16

Amendment.

17

The core purpose of the Eleventh Amendment is to

18

withhold jurisdiction from Federal courts and to withhold

19

the exercise of Federal judicial power against a State in

20

respect of that State's sovereignty.

21

Circuit approach, Federal judicial power is potentially

22

exercised against the State or its entity in virtually

23

every case, or any case in which the plaintiff alleges

24

that there is some payment source for the judgment that

25

might be entered in the case that would satisfy the

Under the Ninth

1

judgment and that would avoid payment of that judgment

2

directly from the State treasury.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, I want to make sure I

4

understand one thing.

5

that this reference to a source of indemnity is simply

6

irrelevant as a matter of law, that there is no

7

circumstance in which that should be taken into

8

consideration in order to determine the Eleventh Amendment

9

status of some supposed arm of the Government.
MR. MILLER:

10

I take it that it's your position

Yes, Your Honor, with this one

11

qualification.

We acknowledge that at some point any

12

entity, not the State itself, may have to be subject to a

13

determination as to whether it is a State entity --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MILLER:

Right.
-- for Eleventh Amendment

16

purposes, and it would be looked at with its overall

17

character.

18

If in some case there were an agency of the

19

State which was entirely supported by indemnification from

20

an outside source like the Federal Government, in that

21

hypothetical situation conceivably the factor of

22

indemnification would be relevant.

23

QUESTION:

Well, are you assuming in the

24

hypothetical that you raise, are you assuming in that case

25

that the State treasury or "State funds" could never be

1

reached, and that the only funds that could be reached

2

would be those of the third party nongovernmental

3

indemnitor?

4

MR. MILLER:

In fact, Your Honor, yes, and

5

beyond that, that the entity was established on the

6

premise --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MILLER:

9
10

Okay.
-- that its -- the State funds

would never be reached.
QUESTION:

So that -- in other words, that

11

doesn't really qualify, I take it, your answer, because

12

your answer is, on the assumption that State funds are

13

reachable at least in theory, the existence of a third

14

party indemnitor is irrelevant as a matter of law to the

15

Eleventh Amendment determination.

16

MR. MILLER:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.
That's the position.

Whether it's

19

an indemnification, insurance claim, a possible claim over

20

or against a third party, a possible joint tortfeasor,

21

anything of the sort.

22

should be relevant, and yet the Ninth Circuit court

23

decision would seem to make any one of those possibilities

24

relevant to a determination in a particular case as to

25

whether a State entity would be entitled to Eleventh

None of those possibilities we say

Amendment immunity.

2

QUESTION:

There was discussion in the Hess case

3

of the potential for judgments to reach or not reach the

4

State treasury.

5

the Hess case.

We seemed to think that was important in
Why is that not important here?

MR. MILLER:

6

Two reasons, Your Honor.

First, in

7

the Hess case the inquiry that the Court made was whether

8

that bi-State entity there, the path, had been established

9

by the two States involved, New York and New Jersey, with

10

an intention that those States be responsible for its

11

various debts, and in that case the Court looked at that

12

overall structure and concluded that the States did not

13

intend their treasuries to be responsible.

14

QUESTION:

So you're saying that the discussion

15

there simply was a way for us to inquire or measure the

16

connection between the bi-State entity and the State?

17

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, that was

18

the standard that the Court announced when it made that --

19

when it took those factors into account.

20

asked --

21

QUESTION:

The Court

Mr. Miller, was an antecedent to

22

getting to that in the Hess case that we were dealing with

23

an entity that had not simply two States as creators, but

24

the Federal Government as well, and then said, there is a

25

presumption that such an entity founded by three

1

sovereigns does not wear the mantle of a State, and maybe

2

that presumption is undone if the States are legally

3

obligated to pick up the tab for it, but --

4

MR. MILLER:

That is absolutely right, Your

5

Honor.

That was going to be my second point, that the

6

Court in the Hess case adopted a standard which started

7

with a presumption against cloaking that particular entity

8

with Eleventh Amendment immunity and required a

9

demonstration that not only the States involved intended

10

for the agency to have their sovereign power, but that the

11

Congress agreed with it.
That's not the standard that would apply in

12

13

judging whether an arm of the State is entitled to

14

Eleventh Amendment immunity, but even under that approach

15

there have been situations where a bi-State entity has

16

been found to have Eleventh Amendment immunity.

17

I think of the case in the D.C. Circuit of the

18

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which

19

Justice Ginsburg's opinion cited in the Hess case, I

20

think, but that was again an application of a special

21

standard for the bi-State entity situation.
QUESTION:

22

But in any event, here there is no

23

legal -- there's no release of the university from legal

24

liability.

25

legal liability.

As there was in the Hess case there was no

MR. MILLER:

1

That's unquestionably true, Your

2

Honor, and were a judgment to be entered on this breach of

3

contract case, claim against the university, the

4

university would be legally liable, and all of the

5

consequences that would flow from having had a court make

6

a legal determination of a violation of someone's rights

7

would apply in the case.
The university, to be sure, under the contract

8

9

here would look to the Department of Energy to satisfy the

10

monetary judgment awarded by the court, and it would hope,

11

in the unlikely event that this occurs, that the

12

Department would respond, but if it didn't, the university

3

would be on the hook to pay the judgment.

4

QUESTION:

In these cases involving

5

universities, is it important for us to inquire whether,

6

as a matter of State law, there is sovereign immunity that

7

attaches to the institution, or is it not important,

8

because sovereign immunity can always be waived?

9

MR. MILLER:

I think it's an element, Your

20

Honor, of the inquiry, the ultimate inquiry which this

21

Court announced in the Mount Healthy case, and I think

22

it's been repeated again in the Hess case and others, was

23

what is the intention of the State in establishing the

24

entity?

25

State sovereign powers?

Did the State intend this entity to exercise
Whether that particular entity

1

has State sovereign immunity could be relevant to that

2

inquiry.

3

In this particular case, there is a general State

4

statute that explains just exactly how, and to what

5

extent, the State waives its sovereign immunity for itself

6

and its entities, and the Regents of the University of

7

California are explicitly named as one of the entities

8

covered by that provision.

9

QUESTION:

Do those statutes, do you think,

10

supersede the California supreme court's decision, the

11

1899 decision where they -- in the Royer case where the

12

California supreme court said that the university, while a

13

governmental institution, is not clothed with the

14

sovereignty of the State and it's not a sovereign?

15
16
17

Do we just ignore that sentence, or has it been
superseded by statute, or -MR. MILLER:

I think that sentence has to be

18

read for precisely what it said.

19

saying the State is an instrument -- I mean, the Regents

20

is an instrumentality of the State.

21

the State itself, and I think that's what the State, what

22

the supreme court was saying, and for that reason, it

23

said, it can be subjected to legislative enactments.

24

that case, it was enactments relating to the probate --

The Court pursued it by

In

1

decisions that even though the State may -- State law may

2

say it's -- an entity is suable in State court, that does

3

not conclude the Eleventh Amendment inquiry in Federal

4

court?

5

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

This Court has

6

made clear that a waiver of Federal court Eleventh

7

Amendment sovereign immunity must be explicit, and is not

8

accomplished simply by a general waiver.

9

QUESTION:

What about the converse proposition,

10

not waiver, but could a State -- let's take a cement plant

11

as an example -- go into the cement business and create

12

the cement administration entity as an arm of the State

3

and say it shall not be immune -- it shall be immune from

4

all suit in Federal court and also in State court?

5

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, it could.

6

It would have to make a decision that it wants the cement

7

operation to be part of the State government, to be

8

clothed with the rights and attributes of State

9

sovereignty.

20

QUESTION:

Is there any Federal limit on the

21

extent to which a State can create subdivisions that will

22

be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity?

23

MR. MILLER:

I don't think there are any Federal

24

limits, Your Honor, because the whole point here of the

25

Eleventh Amendment is to respect State sovereignty and the

1

State's decision as to how to organize itself to carry out

2

its governmental functions, and if the State decides

3

hypothetically that the -- operating a cement plant is a

4

sovereign function it wants to undertake, that decision

5

should be respected.

international law any more.

international sovereign immunity with respect to

9

commercial activities of Governments, and that may well be

11

be extended to the Eleventh Amendment as well, but that's

12

not involved here anyway, is it?

QUESTION:

MR. MILLER:

18

I mean, this Court has looked at the commercial

Yes.
-- comment on it, Justice Scalia.

19

versus governmental distinction in a number of contexts

20

and has tended to find it wanting in every case.

21

The most prominent one I'm thinking of is the

22

Garcia case, where it rejected that basis for

23

distinguishing between functions of governmental entities

24

that would be beyond Federal regulation.

25

QUESTION:

And of course, if you applied that

1

distinctiori here you'd be on the proprietary side of the

2

distinction, wouldn't you?

3

MR. MILLER:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

4

because I think what you'd be looking at would be the

5

university as a whole, and the whole point of this case is

6

that you've got to look at the university as a whole and

7

examine its overall character.

8

9

And the fact that it happens to have a
particular operation that someone might say looks more

10

commercial in nature, just as one might say providing

11

parking lots for the faculty is a little more commercial

12

in nature than a governmental -- one could break this down

13

and in every case perhaps find some basis for arguing that

14

there is an exception to the immunity, and under such an

15

approach I think in the end there would be no immunity,

16

because the university and every other State entity would

17

have to defend itself in every case against the contention

18

that in that particular case its functions are not

19

protected by the immunity, and instead of having an

20

immunity suit, which is what was intended by the Eleventh

21

Amendment, what you'd have would be --

22

QUESTION:

I don't understand that argument.

23

There are clearly some things that the Government would do

24

that are purely governmental -- I mean, carrying out

25

Government policy in one way or another.

You're saying there is no -- you're just saying

1

2

there is no valid distinction between the two kinds of

3

function, and there's a lot of support for that, of

4

course.
MR. MILLER:

5

Yes, Your Honor, and I would say,

6

Justice Stevens, that in the context that we're talking

7

about here, which is how does the State organize itself to

8

carry out functions, I don't think there's any evidence

9

that States elect their form of organization or their

10

activities based upon whether the Eleventh Amendment

11

applies, and no one would make such a suggestion, so if a

12

State, to take your hypothetical, decides --

13

QUESTION:

I don't know why they wouldn't.

If

14

they go into the cement business, as Colorado did, why,

15

they might take that into account.

16

perfectly legitimate.

17

MR. MILLER:

It seems to me

I don't know of any evidence that

18

any State in fact takes that kind of consideration into

19

account.

20

would seem to me not worth distorting the purposes of the

21

Eleventh Amendment simply to protect against that somewhat

22

unlikely scenario.

23

At least until that evidence was present it

QUESTION:

In any event, Mr. Miller, in this

24

case you're saying that we have to deal with the

1

Livermore Laboratory might be if it were a discrete

2

entity.

3

MR. MILLER:

That's correct, Your Honor, and you

4

may ask why is that the case, and my response would be

5

because the minute you start breaking down the activity of

6

an entity function by function, activity by activity, you

7

are inviting in every case an opportunity for litigation

8

in the Federal court as to whether or not that particular

9

entity is entitled to immunity in that particular case.

10

And that series of events has as its ultimate

11

consequence the evisceration of the immunity that the

12

Eleventh Amendment was intended to present, and it makes

13

no difference whether it's a Federal question case or a

14

diversity case like this case, where the issue involved is

15

one of State law, and it seems to us in that situation the

16

cases of this Court are clear that the entity needs to be

17

viewed as a whole.

If I may reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Chief Justice --

Second,

the court of appeals

As to our first point, this Court has repeatedly

held that the Eleventh Amendment does not exist simply to

protect a State against damages that must be paid out of

12

the State's treasury.

It also exists to protect the

State's dignitary interest in not being sued by private

MS. BLATT:

the third party liability clause.

It's both a widening of the scope of the

potential contractor's officers that can commit misconduct

or, if you will, conduct that would result in unallowable

10

costs, as well as it's a heightening of the standard.

11

It's no longer wilful misconduct or lack of good faith.

12

It's simply lack of prudent business judgment, and the

3

Department and the University of California are currently

No, other than to assume that they

QUESTION:

Ms. Blatt, that was the way the

5

question presented was worded, but the Ninth Circuit

decision was more diffuse, wasn't it?

7

one of -- they have five factor tests, and we're reviewing

8

that determination, so how could we just pick out the neat

we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit decision that says there

11

are these five factors, add them all up, and we come out

with not an am of the State?

13

MS. BLATT:

They said, this is

I think it's a fair characterization

14

of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that what distinguished the

15

university in this situation was the court of appeals view

16

of the Department of Energy's contractual obligations, and

17

our position is not to dispute any of the factors the

this payment factor that an indemnity allegation is solely

the existence of an indemnification agreement as such is

2

simply an irrelevant consideration.

3

MS. BLATT:

That's correct, and you have here

4

what certainly we did not dispute, was that the State of

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

Given those facts, if there's

a legal connection, a legal liability to the State entity

3

in question the existence of an indemnity agreement with a

4

third party does not alter that entity's status under the

Eleventh Amendment, and that's again because the

university is on the hook for the judgment and that third

party may or not -- may or may not be forthcoming, and in

any event, that doesn't change the relationship between

the plaintiff, the university as a defendant, and the

those costs to the Department of Energy, and in our view

That's on page 1 of the

QUESTION:

But I didn't think we had taken this

case to go into whether, absent the indemnification
provision, there is sovereign immunity or not.
You know, there are a million different
entities, and each one of them have different
considerations, and we normally don't take up each case to
decide whether the court of appeals got it right that
applying the normal factors this was the State or this
wasn't the State.
I thought the only issue before us here was
whether, assuming it is otherwise the State, the
indemnification feature makes a change.

The contract would -- you know, the

1

Aside from the fact that the

there any other feature that would distinguish Justice

MR. GAYER:

5

Thank you, Justice Scalia, yes,

6

there's an important distinction here, I think, that in

7

general an indemnitor such as an insurance company is

quite separate from the contract, say, between the

Government and the Regents corporation.

It would be some

outside insurance company that would be agreeing to

General the -- this Court has never determined whether any

purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, so I don't think we

And what the Ninth Circuit did, it says, let's

look at the facts.

We look at the facts, and we assume

that a promise made by the Federal Government in writing

it says it's going to pay directly, will pay directly.

10

Why not assume that the Government is going to act in bad

faith?

I think that's a fair presumption.
I think it would unduly expand the immunity

provided by the Eleventh Amendment if you could let States

by saying, not in this instance, because we've got a

money-making venture, and any money that's going to be

7

paid will come out of the profits of that entity?
MR. GAYER:

8

9

Well, it depends on how the

university is structured.

I don't know if this is going

10

beyond Justice Ginsburg's question, but in this particular

case we assume the athletic endeavor has no contract with

the Department of Energy, and there's no pay directly

In any event, as Your Honor pointed

picture, and so whether or not, of course, the university

6

or anything.

7

It's certainly not determinative or dispositive

I think that each case, as the Ninth Circuit

8

did, looks at the facts, looks at the law as presented by

9

the plaintiffs.

In our proposed procedure, we suggest

10

that the plaintiff had the burden of inducing facts and

11

law that shows that the purported -- that the State entity

12

is not a State agency, that is to say, is not an arm,

13

therefore doesn't deserve Eleventh Amendment protection.

14

Otherwise, you run the risk of undue expansion of Eleventh

15

Amendment immunity, and anything that says "of California"

16

is immune, and that's the end of it.

17

Now, Justice Ginsburg, I was thinking of

18

something about insulating treasuries, and in this case

19

the State law of California does insulate the State

20

treasury from the Regents.

21

a judgment against the Regents can be executed only

22

against the treasury of the Regents.

23

against the very separate and probably larger State

24

QUESTION:

So a State university is not an arm

of any State if that university has a budget that's

6

discrete and pays all its expenses out of that.

MR. GAYER:

8

9
10

A State -- a treasury, a treasury

that's independent and wherein the university or college
has no claim against the treasury of the State itself.
In other words, here, the Regents' treasury has

11
12

That's

a lot of money in it.

I think according to a footnote in

3

the reply brief something -- in one particular year, $ 0

4

billion.

5

of a block grant from the State.

Now, in that year, $2.2 billion came in the form

6

The legislature made an appropriation to give

7

the money to the Regents to use for any lawful purpose.

8

After that, the State lets go.

9

and the Regents must make do with whatever money they can

20

get, and most of their money comes from outside the State,

21

but the point is that a judgment creditor of the Regents

22

has no claim against the State treasury, ever, and that's

23

why I think this case --

otherwise be a State agency, it isn't when this particular

2

liability is covered in full by a third party?

3

MR. GAYER:

Yes.

I think we've addressed that

4

fully in the briefs, and perhaps this morning.

5

true, but I think in order to do a thorough, complete, and

6

meaningful job this Court might consider the general

7

question, otherwise the courts below are still having to

8

wonder about this fundamental issue, and one can assume

9

arguendo so many things that there's nothing left to argue

10
11
12

That's

about.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps there would be a

problem of parties who are not before us.

There must be

3

many State universities that are patterned the same way,

4

intended to have a large budget and to pay their expenses

5

out of that.

6

MR. GAYER:

My research, although not complete,

7

says the answer to that question, Your Honor, is no, that

8

those cases I have read -- for instance, the Rutledge

9

case, Rutledge v. the Regents of the University of

20

Arizona, another Ninth Circuit case, held that there,

21

there is control by the legislature.

QUESTION:

about control.

1

MR. GAYER:

Well, the point I'm trying to make

2

is that in the Rutledge case the Ninth Circuit held that

3

the Regents there were very different, and they were not

4

separate and independent and autonomous, whereas in the

5

instant case the Regents are very separate, very

6

independent, and very autonomous of any control by the

7

elected branches of State government.

8

9

QUESTION:

May I -- I'd like to make sure I

understand one part of your argument.

The court of

10

appeals applied this five-factor test, the first factor

11

whether this money judgment would be satisfied out of

12

State funds, and they said it would not be because of the

3
4

indemnity agreement.
You are arguing, if I understand you correctly,

5

that even without the indemnity agreement, the judgment

6

would not have been satisfied out of State funds.

7

MR. GAYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It says

I could have done a better job in the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

And -- but -- so we're not --

what's -- we're only addressing the indemnity question, or

21

are we supposed to decide the whole case?

Oh.
I don't think so, but Your Honor, to

respond to your question, I'm not an expert on this

of the Regents' overall immunity is subsumed within the

question presented.

will tell me.

QUESTION:

If I'm wrong, I'm sure Your Honors

Well, subsumed generally means a

you're saying is that a larger question is included in a

Oh, sure, this Court has everything

If we were to say that, do you think that

has no legal liability in this case, that the result would

be the same.

That's -- that makes the further assumption

10

that the treasury of the Regents of the University of

California is not part of the State, and I'm sure the

counsel for the appellants are going to tell us that the

13

whole purpose of the very substantial separation that the

State law is that the Regents funds are not State funds in

But they're in control of another

running a hospital for which it charges the market rates

MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

I'd like to begin by referring to this -- I

3

don't mean to be -- try to inject too much levity, but the

4

foundation of sand.

5

The foundation of sand starts here, because the

6

ultimate foundation is the Hamilton v. Board of Regents

7

case in 293 U.S., where this Court determined, based upon

8

a study of the California constitution and statutes, that

9

the university and its Regents were the State, and in fact

10

that its orders, the orders of the Board of Regents, were

11

equivalent to state statutes, would be deemed the same for

12

purposes of that case.

3

Now, that wasn't an Eleventh Amendment case, but

4

I do think it's an important decision that was built upon

5

in the decisions of the district courts and in the Ninth

6

Circuit court that have held repeatedly that the

7

university is an arm of the State.

8
9

The decision in the Vaughn case which is cited
in our brief, a district court case, is the case in which

20

the factors were reviewed and then, in the various Ninth

21

Circuit cases, Vaughn and other cases subsequent to Vaughn

22

were referred to and relied upon as precedent.

23

The fact that the university is an arm of the

24

State is now beyond serious debate as far as the Ninth

25

Circuit's concerned as a general proposition, and it

1

ultimately rests on the decision of this Court in

2

Hamilton.
That leads me to the next point, which is the

3
4

contention that the university is separate from the State

5

because the State is not responsible for its debts.

6

Justice Kennedy, you anticipated our point on this.

7

treasury of the Regents is very much a State fund, and all

8

of the attributes of sovereignty that are given to the

9

Regents in the California constitution and statutes are

The

10

designed to assure that the Regents would be treated as a

11

branch of State government, albeit independent of

12

political control, for the very important reasons of

13

academic freedom and independence of education that

14

animated the founders of the State back in the middle 19th

15

Century.

16

Notwithstanding that, the constitution of

17

California, Article XVI, section 8, provides a very

18

special provision for any obligations of State

19

universities.

20

State revenues there shall first be set apart the moneys

21

to be applied by the State for the support of the public

22

school system and public institutions of higher education.

23

out that that gives in effect a first charge on the

university.

2

The manner in which that is done is the same

3

manner in which the Congress funds Federal agencies, by

4

appropriation, and no doubt until the appropriation is

5

made a debt can't be paid if the Regents don't have

6

otherwise sufficient funds, but in the end, the

7

legislature is responsible, by constitutional provision,

8

to meet the obligations of the university, and in that

9

additional way ties the university tightly to the State of

10

which it is a part and an arm, if not a branch.

11

I want to make just one other point, and that is

12

that the relief in this case seeks not only damages

against the university, but also hiring of the plaintiff.
