ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. LEIBIG

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEIBIG:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the application of a rule in

12

13

the Fair Labor Standards Act dealing with the salary basis

14

test.

15

541.118.

16

The rule is contained in 29 C.F.R. 541.5d and

The rule basically provides that for persons to

17

be considered white collar exempt -- that is, professional

18

exempt adminis -- professionals, administrators, exempt

19

administrators or exempt executives, their salary must be

20

fixed and not contingent.

21

The specifics of the rule provide that they must

22

receive a predetermined amount not subject to deduction

23

because of the variations in quality or quantity of work.

24
25

QUESTION:

I've noticed with interest that the

Federal Government does not follow the salary basis test

for employees that are under the jurisdiction of the

2

Office of Personnel Management.

along with that at all.

MR. LEIBIG:

It chooses not to go

Well, it attempted to choose not to

go along with that at all.
In

975, I believe, when the Federal Government

7

first came under the act, Congress provided that the Fair

8

Labor Standard Act would be enforced by the Office of

9

Personnel Management, but that the rule -- but the

10

definitions would still be defined and delinated by the

11

Department of Labor, and when the Office of Personnel

12

Management initially issued regulations for the Federal

3

sector, they defined exempt status for salaried persons

4

based on salary classifications.

5

But that definition was challenged in court in a

6

specific case involving the Uniform Division of the Secret

7

Service, Police Sergeants and Lieutenants, and the court

8

of claims in that case specifically found that the

9

enforcement by the Office of Personnel Management has to

20

be undertaken consistently, consistent with the Department

21

of Labor regulations, because it's the Department of Labor

22

that defines and limits exemptions --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And now are all Federal employees

applying this salary basis test?
MR. LEIBIG:

Well, first of all the court of

1

claims found that to be the case.

2

they also found it in some other cases involving the AFG

3

case, which is cited in the briefs, and currently the

4

position in the Department of Labor -- I'm sorry.

5

They found it -- and

The position in the Federal Government is that

6

the Office of Personnel Management often treats people as

7

exempt even though they're not salaried, but the Court of

8

Claims and the United States District -- the United States

9

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have held

10
11

12

that they should apply the salary test.
And when that has been a challenge -- and the
one place it's been challenged specifically is in the

3

Uniform Division of the Secret Service and for employees

4

that are exactly -- do the exact work of the employees in

5

this case, that is, sergeants and lieutenants in the

6

Uniform Division, and the court ruled that the Department

7

of Labor pay classification things have to be applied

8

consistent with the salary basis.

QUESTION:

But Justice O'Connor was not asking

20

about court decisions, she was asking about the position

21

being taken by the executive branch --

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEIBIG:

-- view from Labor, doesn't it?
The Office of Personnel Management

3

takes the position that Federal employees can be exempted

4

based on pay classification alone.

5

and I think that the courts have found that to be the

6

case, and I don't think it's consistent with the statute.

7

I do not think that,

For example, when Congress passed the statute

8

applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to themselves, they

9

did make -- apply the salary basis test to themselves, and

10

under the Professional Accountability Act, the regulations

11

under that act specifically say that the salary basis test

12

does apply to congressional employees.

13

And it specifically includes the regulation

14

including, there was some discussion in the comments on

15

the regulation of whether 541.5d, which is a special rule

16

limiting part of it -- I'll talk about in a minute -- how

17

that should be dealt with by the Congressional

18

Accountability Office, and after considering the comments

19

they included the regulation and specifically made

20

reference to the applicability of the salary basis test to

21

congressional employees.

22

So -- and in addition to that, in the record

23

there's a history of the Department of Labor's current

24

consideration of the regulations and as part of that

25

history the Director of OMB has had a series of reports

1

and considerations with the Department of Labor about this

2

problem and what to deal -- how to deal with it in the

3

future.

4

So the answer is, the Office of Personnel

5

Management, just like a lot of employers in a lot of

6

places, claim that they can exempt people based on

7

classifications alone, but when the Federal Government and

8

when the Congress have looked at it they've said they have

9

to
QUESTION:

10

Well, they also have a regulation

11

saying the Federal Government can dismiss or suspend

12

employees for 14 days or less.

13

MR. LEIBIG:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LEIBIG:

Right.
By way of discipline.
They have a regulation to -- yes,

16

that's true, they do, and in the -- and the -- that raises

17

the question of whether that would make all Federal

18

employees subject to that rule, which doesn't cover all

19

Federal employees, but I think it covers all Federal

20

employees in the Classified Service, nonexempt, and I

21

think that is part of the struggle the Department of Labor

22

has had, and that is why the Department of Labor has had

23

the practical rule to the longstanding salary basis test,

24

and I think I can explain how the practical rule I think

25

works.

1

But if you look at, and we attach the Department

2

of Labor briefs going back from 1981 and their positions,

3

there has been some development in how you deal with the

4

problem where there's a rule on the books that seems

5

counterintuitive.

6

How can an employer apply that rule?

And I think the rule that I would argue is that

7

the first rule of the regulation, and after all, the

8

Department of Labor that issued this regulation issued it

9

under a direct rule of Congress, is that the employee's

10
11

salary must be fixed, and it cannot be contingent.
An exempt employee cannot have contingent

12

income, and that, however -- that is the test, and then,

13

however, there can be a situation where there are rules on

14

the books, where people have a rule that says you're --

15

you can be subject to discipline by -- for 14 days, which

16

would be longer than a work period, so that would be okay.

17

But if under that rule they discipline somebody

18

for 1 day, which, by the way, the statute -- the Federal

19

regulation doesn't say they can do, but if they did do it,

20

that would raise the question of whether the people were

21

practically subject to deductions for less than a full

22

work period, and I think in that case you'd have to

23

prove -- if all you had was a rule and the employer

24

claimed that the people were exempt and that they were not

25

doing deductions, I think the burden's on the employer to

They at least have to assert that we wouldn't

asserting,

one sergeant that all the other people who have never been

disciplined fall under some nonexempt status.

Just on the basis of some possibly

broader State rule applicab -- or a county rule, or police

MR. LEIBIG:

I'm

asserting that all sergeants

and lieutenants in the St. Louis Police Department whose

pay is contingent and who all the witnesses,

MR. LEIBIG:

It -- I'm sorry, it didn't -- there

is evidence in the record that it did happen to other

sergeants, in fact, and in fact it did happen to other

5

sergeants.

6

What's not in the record is an example of a

7

specific sergeant who testified that he was suspended, but

8

the reason for that is, if you look at the whole record,

9

the case was bifurcated, and it was tried on the basis of

10

11
12

representative witnesses.
For example, there was only one witness that
testified that he was a homicide detective --

MR. LEIBIG:

16

Well, the --- and yet all the homicide

The Eighth Circuit, as I read its

17

opinion, said that a one-time suspension without pay for

18

violating the city's residence requirement doesn't mean

19

that the whole thing is over.

20

that ruling?

21

MR. LEIBIG:

Now, do you disagree with

I agree that a one-time suspension,

22

standing in isolation, if the employer took the position

23

that the pay was guaranteed and that was a mistake, it was

24

inadvertent, that it wouldn't automatically mean, so a

25

one-time suspension all by itself would not settle the

case, and one reason for that is the burden's on the

2

employer in the first in to establish -- in the first

3

instance to establish the employees are guaranteed a

4

predetermined amount of pay.

5

One instance of a -- somebody losing a

6

guaranteed amount of pay would certainly raise a lot of

7

suspicion, but if the employer were in some case -- in a

8

given case, for instance, to claim that was a mistake, it

9

wasn't under the rules, that's different.
But in our case the chief of police, the

10
11

30(b)(6) designees of the employer for exempt status and

12

for application to the regulations, and everyone else

13

testified that in fact all sergeants were subject to being

14

disciplined, and there is repeated evidence in the record

15

which -- which is cited in the brief.

QUESTION:

discipline, other than this one sergeant?

Michael Fredericks testified that he knew of sergeants

2

that were suspended for less than a day.

3

there is no -- in the record there is no other name of a

4

specific sergeant who was suspended, but there is a great

5

deal of evidence that in fact other sergeants, other than

Mr. Guzy, were suspended.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LEIBIG:

12

There's no --

No.
-- did it?
Because the Eighth Circuit did not

agree with the base rule -- a) they didn't agree that the

3

burden was on the employer to establish that pay was fixed

4

rather than contingent, and b) they put the burden on the

5

plaintiffs to establish actual instances of deduction,

6

which I don't think they should have done, but looking at

7

all the evidence of the record, no one could conclude from

8

the evidence of that record that the regulation which says

9

pay is not subject to deduction was followed in this case.

No.

The Eighth Circuit -- the

5

Eighth Circuit said that Mr. Guzy was suspended.

7

have a rule that made everybody subject to suspension.

8

They don't think that's required.

The

For instance, if you compare the Eighth Circuit

10

decisions to the decisions in, now, seven of the eight

11

circuits, in the Second Circuit the Yourman case, in the

12

Third Circuit the Balgowan case, in the Fourth Circuit the

13

Shockley case, in the Sixth Circuit the two Michigan court

cases, and in the Seventh Circuit Mueller and Bankston,

15

and in the Ninth Circuit Abshire and six or seven other

16

cases, in the Tenth Circuit Carpenter and Spradling, all

17

of those cases heard said that the test is not whether or

18

not there were actual individual instances of deductions.

19

The question is whether the person working there is

20

subject is fixed -- pay is fixed or contingent.
If you have contingent pay, then you cannot be

21
22

exempt, and there's a reason for that.

If you only say

the people who are disciplined lose the exemption, then

24

you say only rule-breakers would be exempt.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, but you have a letter, a couple

of letters from the Secretary here --

3

MR. LEIBIG:

4

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
-- saying that the exemption -- the

5

exemption is lost as to all employees only if the employer

6

engages in a regular and recurrent practice of making

7

impermissible deductions, and the opinion we have before

8

us does not find that the police department had a regular

9

and recurring practice.

10
11

It dealt only with the one

sergeant.
MR. LEIBIG:

The -- there aren't a series of

12

letters from the Department.

The Department of Labor has

13

written one letter in one other place where they said that

14

they will look for regularly recurring exemptions, but

15

they've always done that in the context of whether -- and

16

the regulation itself, the plain wording of the regulation

17

itself says the key is whether you're subject to

18

deduction, not whether actual deductions occur.

19

There's also some confusion because --

20

QUESTION:

It would be an important factor in

21

deciding whether you were subject to deduction to know

whether actual deductions occurred, would it not?

MR. LEIBIG:

Go ahead and finish -- you had -Just one other point.

That

parts of the regulation.

7

disciplinary deductions, and I think the enact -- the part

8

about being absent for part of a day doesn't apply in the

9

public sector any more anyway, and I can explain more

10

-- there's two

One talks about deductions for
Another part talks about

about that why -- why, if you need to.
But the point is, disciplinary deductions are

11

12

There's a difference

different than deductions for part of a day.

An employer

3

that allows employees to leave for part of a day means to

4

adopt a flexible work schedule, and intends people to be

5

able to come and go as they please.

6

if people didn't leave for part of a day, so you'd want to

7

find -- you'd expect to find a lot of people who did.

8

However, disciplinary rules are exactly the

9

opposite.

It would be unusual

The reason the employer imposes disciplinary

20

rules is so people will obey them and anticipates that

21

they will not disobey them.

QUESTION:

May I ask a question about these

23

disciplinary rules?

Is this manual applicable to all

employees, including people who are undoubtedly covered by

All right.
Regular line officers.
Now, why couldn't somebody look at

this code and say, gee, it's got a range of sanctions,

from reprimand to dismissal, and we'll assume that a law-

17

abiding employer is going to apply to the people who are

subject to the act, the sanctions, the full range of

19

sanctions, but to the people who are exempt, only -- only

20

those sanctions that would fit with exempt status.

This is the testimony of the chief

the page -- well, first he was asked, as a result of

right before that.

MR. LEIBIG:

It's only if you

Well, there are some provisions in

the manual that the penalty, the only penalty listed there

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, do you take the position that

the only form of discipline is docking?

8

MR. LEIBIG:

9

QUESTION:

No.
All right.

So the manual itself

10

doesn't get you home, at least, nor does the testimony at

11

page 62, because he just says there's been some

12

discipline, and I think that we must assume that there are

13

possibly forms of discipline other than docking.

14

MR. LEIBIG:

There are, and there's a chart in

15

the manual that says when it's docking and when it's not

16

docking, and in some of the penalties, the only penalty --

17

for instance, in the second -- in the second non -- in the

2

Discipline can be many things, from a reprimand to

termination.

4

MR. LEIBIG:

No -- I'm sorry.

It shows -- the

8

violations and then it has a list of all the penalties,

9

and it says what the penalty is for a first offense and a

10

second offense, and many of those penalties include

11

suspensions, from a letter of reprimand to a 5-day

12

suspension, and for a first or second day, and for

13

example, one of the penalties provides a 1-day suspension.

reasoning that it's clear, because I come back to a

question that's been asked before.

20

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, why

21

shouldn't we assume that an employer who knows that he

22

cannot apply a particular disciplinary form consistent

23

with the status, with the salaried status for the Fair

24

Labor Standards Act, will not apply it?

25

You've got a manual that applies across the

absence of evidence to the contrary, that the employer

3

will not apply what is in that manual in such a way as to

4

destroy the salaried status?

5

MR. LEIBIG:

Why shouldn't we assume, in the

First -- for two reasons.

One is,

6

under the statute the requirement to establish exemptions,

7

the burden is on the employer, not on the employee, so you

8

shouldn't assume anything.

9

The second thing, however, is, suppose the

10

employer -- the employer should at least be put to a

11

standard of proof to assert that sergeants and

12

lieutenants -- have some witnesses or have somebody assert

13

on the record that sergeants and lieutenants are not

14

subject to being suspended for a 2-day suspension, for

15

example, and in this case the employer simply never did

that.

The reason they simply never did that is, people
had been suspended, and it -- there are --

the burden on the employees to prove exempt status.

it is because it's contrary to the whole idea of having --

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that the existence of the

20

respondent's police manual cannot by itself show that

21

petitioners as a class are subject to disciplinary

22

deductions of less than 1 week's pay within the meaning of

23

the Secretary's salary basis test, and we reach that

24

conclusion for three reasons.

25

The first is that the Secretary interprets the

phrase subject to reduction to mean that there must be

2

more than a theoretical possibility that a violation of a

3

work rule will result in a partial week disciplinary

4

deduction.
QUESTION:

5

Would that more than theoretical

6

possibility be satisfied in an instance in which the

7

employer had promulgated the manual solely to salaried

8

employees, and yet nonetheless provided as to them that

9

there would be these impermissible dockings.

Correct.

fit with the statute.

That's right, and I --

I think, Justice -- I --

And that's what I want to understand,

how that fits within this case.

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think what the Secretary did

8

when he originally formulated the regulations was to try

9

to draw a line that would not necessarily make a 100-

10

percent case in every single case, but would be a

11

reasonable line for the vast amount of cases.
And what the Secretary concluded, based on

12

13

hearings that were held after, in the wake of the Fair

14

Labor Standards Act being enacted, is that one of the

15

hallmarks of having the exempt status, the exempt -- that

16

exempt employees, one of the hallmarks of the importance

17

and status that those employees had is that they were paid

18

on a weekly basis, that for any week in which they worked

19

they would receive a full week's pay.

He says, this

MR. GORNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

3

I think it is wrong to --

The statute doesn't say that.

The

fact is, Gates shouldn't be within it.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

4

Justice Scalia, what the statute

5

says is that they are executive, administrative, and

6

professional, as defined by the Secretary.

7

the statute says, and it gives the Secretary wide leeway

8

to give content to the meaning of those terms.

That's what

And what the Secretary has done is set out an
10

administrable statute, not to leave to a district court or

11

an employer in every case to figure out whether under the

12

totality of circumstances we are going to regard this

13

person as executive, administrative, or professional.
QUESTION:

14

So your response is, if Microsoft

15

doesn't like it, it can just rescind the rule that -- you

16

know, punish Gates some other way.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Some other way, or if it was a

18

one-time deduction, then the window of correction could be

1

used to retroactively restore his exempt status.
QUESTION:

20

And that's good, and so that's why

21

you say the effect of making a deduction which is not

22

permitted under the rule as a practical matter depends on

23

the case.

saying that then here you look at practically what happens

in this case.

didn't transmute them into hourly employees.

You're saying as a practical matter the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That is correct, that that --

And that's a -That as a practical matter in

8

this case, I don't think you have to get to the window of

9

correction to decide that, though.

I think you can look

10

at just the text of the 541.118 and here we interpret the

11

term, subject to reduction, to mean that as a practical

12

matter the employees in the class have to face a

13

significant possibility of having their pay reduced.

14

If there is no such practice, there is no such

15

policy, and nonetheless there is a deduction taken, for

16

whatever reason, then you look to the window of correction

17

to restore retroactive status.

Now, the second point --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct, that there's not

a significant possibility that employees in this class

will face partial week disciplinary suspensions.

4

QUESTION:

And in this case the employer bears

5

not just that initial burden, but also the burden of

6

overcoming a manual which on its face is applicable to all

7

employees, and on its face seems to say that these people

8

are subject to it.

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, let me talk about the

10

manual on its face, because the manual is broadly

11

applicable to all employees, both those who clearly

12

perform exempt duties, like captains on up, and clearly

13

perform nonexempt duties, like patrol officers who patrol

14

the beat, and those rules can all be enforced in ways that

15

are completely consistent with retaining exempt status for

16

those employees who perform clearly exempt duties, so I

think if you just look at the manual --

QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with the -- what

19

do you do with the point that your brother was making

about the record, that the chief and the others who came

in and testified didn't testify that these particular

sanctions would be applied only to the nonsalaried.

with your argument, did they?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think that as the case came to

the court of appeals that the petitioner in this case

really put the case to the court of appeals, you can just

look at the manual and you can add in the Guzy incident,

6

and we should win this case.

7

None of this was brought to the attention of the

9

that was framed for review by this Court.

10

None of this was part of the question

Again, I think the question that was framed for

11

review by this Court was, can you just look at this manual

12

and conclude that these people are subject to disciplinary

13

deductions.

14

The burden of proof issue was not raised in the

15

court of appeals, and I don't think it was raised here.

16

think there is a problem.

18

could or could not happen.

there is a prelitigation correction rule in the window.

MR. RENICK:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Let me address this -- at least partially this

4

question about the chief of police's testimony.

5

all, I think it's important for the Court to understand

6

that the chief of police does not impose discipline.

7

is the role of the police board, which is the defendant in

8

this case.

9

First of

That

Secondly, if you examine the testimony that

10

Mr. Leibig was referring to, the chief consistently says,

11

you know, maybe that could happen, it's possible, but he

12

can't recall it ever happening, and I think that's

13

important, and I think that points out the problem with

14

petitioner's position here as to someone who's subject to

15

a deduction.

16

And it goes to Justice Breyer's point.

17

Logically, you could file one of these lawsuits and take

18

the deposition of the chief executive officer and simply

19

ask the question, is it possible that you could discipline

20

one of your vice presidents who is found to have engaged

21

in some kind of misconduct for a period of less than a

22

week.

23

And if the answer to that is yes, it's possible,

24

because that is part of the inherent right of management,

25

then the logical extension of petitioner's argument is

MR. RENICK:

He wrote this

Well -I mean, we'll blame it on him.
We think that that shows that that

interpretation really doesn't make sense.
QUESTION:

Well, would you agree that if you had

a manual that applied only to salaried employees, and

specifically provided for discipline that would be

inconsistent with salaried status, that that would be

enough to preclude salaried status?

MR. RENICK:

If the discipline -- if the manual

was worded in such a way that discipline was mandatory, I
would agree with you, Justice Souter.
QUESTION:

Well, I -- wouldn't -- wouldn't we be

22

entitled to act on the assumption that the manual was not

23

a totally nugatory exercise and that, in at least some

24

instances, consistently with the manual, discipline would

25

be applied?

Wouldn't that be a reasonable basis for a

2

MR. RENICK:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but I still -I mean, your argument has to say --

4

it seems to me seems to be, even when they specifically

5

say they will do and are entitled to do what is

6

inconsistent with salaried status, we won't take them at

7

their word.

8

We'll wait and see.

MR. RENICK:

That surely is --

What I'm saying is, and I think the

Secretary of Labor has agreed with our position, is
10

that -- is that as -- you have to look at what actual

11

experience -- the best evidence is what is the actual

12

experience in the application of whatever manual -- if you

13

have a manual or not, what has actually happened, and the

14

evidence in this case is very clear.

15

In 1 7 , which was 6 years before the Garcia

16

case was decided by this Court, the legislature of the

17

State of Missouri amended the governing statute which

18

controls the operations of the St. Louis Police Department

1

to convert all commissioned officers at the rank of

20

sergeant or above to a salary basis of payment.

21

It specifically amended the statute to disallow

22

payment of overtime and to compensate for that they gave

23

everyone an across-the-board 8 percent increase, and none

24

of the individuals in this case have come forward --

Not a single one of those sergeants took

Oh, I quite agree, but that's not the

case that I put to you in the question.
MR. RENICK:

7

Well, I think I'm agreeing with you

8

if you have a manual that says this is specifically

9

applicable to exempt employees, or functionally exempt,

10

and it provides that penalties will be imposed for certain

11

forms of misconduct that would be periods of less than a

12

week, if you accept the Secretary's interpretation of the

13

salary basis test, then I would agree with you.
QUESTION:

14

But the Secre -- but penalties may be

15

imposed.

16

position is that would not be enough.

17

If it says penalties may be imposed, your

MR. RENICK:

Well, I think then you have to look

18

at the practice, because I think as one of the justices

19

earlier pointed out, I think you -- where there are a

20

range of penalties, as there are in this case, there's no

21

reason to assume that the employer is going to choose a

22

new proper penalty and thereby convert all of his or her

23

salaried employees to nonexempt employees.

24
25

QUESTION:

regulation says is not which amount must be reduced

because of variations in the quality or -- it says which

2

amount is not subject to reduction, and you know, subject

3

to reduction doesn't mean will certainly be reduced.

4

MR. RENICK:

5

QUESTION:

Well -It just means it's subject to

6

reduction, and as I understood the exception is, if that

7

thing is just a paper tiger, that in fact it is never

8

used, that's one thing, but if it's even used in one case,

9

it seems to me that's enough to show that it's for real.
MR. RENICK:

10

Well,

but the state of the record

11

here, Justice Scalia, is that in the period between 1979,

12

when the statute was amended, and the time we went to

13

trial in 1993, not one witness came forth to testify that

14

he or she had been subjected to a disciplinary proceeding

15

initiated by the department, by the police department,

16

based on a variation, which is the word in the

17

interpretation, on a variation in the quality or quantity

of work.

MR. RENICK:

2

The employer prevailed on the

3

salary test on partial summary judgment prior to the

4

trial, and the record shows that I queried the trial judge

5

both at the beginning and at the end of my presentation to

6

ensure that that issue was no longer in the case.

7

QUESTION:

Do you claim to have established at

8

trial that nobody had, that nobody had been subjected to

9

this disqualifying kind of discipline?
MR. RENICK:

10

At the trial there was no evidence

11

to that effect because we had prevailed on partial summary

12

judgment prior to trial.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Okay, but it seems to me that's your

burden.
MR. RENICK:

The trial judge found that we met

16

that burden when he ruled in a pretrial ruling which

17

granted partial summary judgment on the salary basis issue

18

and took that out of the case.

QUESTION:

May I ask you to just address the one

thing that I find a little puzzling?

QUESTION:

MR. RENICK:

Right.
Which was a requirement of

6

quality or quantity of his work, so it would be my

7

position that he was never subjected to a reduction in his

8

salary based on anything that had to do with the quality

9

or quantity of his work, which is the phrase that the

10
11

That had absolutely nothing to do with the

Secretary uses.
Secondly, our position has been consistently in

12

this litigation that if we are wrong -- and the Eighth

13

Circuit's opinion actually only says arguably that this

14

deduction made Sergeant Guzy nonexempt, and we think it's

15

just as reasonable that it may not be, but our position

16

has been all along that if at the outcome of this

17

litigation it is determined that that was an impermissible

18

deduction, the salary test basis is validly applied to the

19

Board of Police Commissioners, then we will comply by

20

reimbursing Sergeant Guzy, and we will continue our

21

existing practice of not allowing deductions of less than

22

a week for exempt officers.

MR. RENICK:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Now, you raise a lot of other issues,

I think, in your response, an Eleventh Amendment issue, a

5

claim that the FSLA does not apply at all to public

employees of State and local government, and so forth.

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Respondents never filed a crossÂ­

No, we did not.

That's correct.
And you went forward under that

assumption the court -MR. RENICK:

Well, the first question presented

in the petition for the writ of certiorari, as I recall,

1

is does the salary basis test validly apply to public

20

employees, and we would say on the facts of this case,

just demonstrates that taking this disciplinary deduction

arbitrary and capricious.

circumstances.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any authority in the

circuits to support the argument that the subject to

simply applies when the work changes, for the operational

8

common sense reading of it when I read the regulation, but

I don't know if there's any support for that.
MR. RENICK:

10

That is what I thought was the

I think that is the common sense

11

reading.

12

what the Secretary of Labor --

14

When you read 541.118(a) in the general sense,

QUESTION:

It's such a common sense reading that

none of the circuits seem to have adopted it.

MR. RENICK:

The circuits --

The circuits have all picked up the

18

point of what we're dealing with here, that a disciplinary

suspension fits under 541.118(a)(5), which says

20

penalties -- it's actually worded in the affirmative, that

21

an employer may impose penalties which -- for violations

22

of major safety rules.

That has since been interpreted to mean a

penalty can be a suspension without pay, and the courts

that you can't impose a penalty for something that's not a

violation of a major safety rule, and I think that's how

3

we get where we are here.

5

QUESTION:

Has the agency ever expressly

rejected the interpretation I suggest?
MR. RENICK:

6

Not to my knowledge, although it is

7

a matter of record at pages 43 through 46 of the joint

8

appendix that the Secretary of Labor went on record this

9

May and indicated that there was still confusion among

10

litigants, particularly in the public sector, as to what

11

all this means, and it appears that the Secretary intends

12

to undertake some kind of a rulemaking procedure to review

13

this disciplinary aspect of the salary test.

QUESTION:

15

MR. RENICK:

QUESTION:

you -- you made -- one of your border attacks was on the

2

Government's position as irrational in distinguishing

3

between suspension for a full week versus a couple of

4

days.
MR. RENICK:

5

That's correct.

We believe that,

6

particularly on the facts of this case, we are dealing

7

with a law enforcement agency where you have a recognized

8

exception that -- and you -- and again, you have to go
back to the premise that all of these sections of the

10

salary basis test are based on studies that were conducted

11

in the 1 40's and fifties, when public employers were not

12

subject to the law, and that's part of the problem, is now

13

trying to take what seemed to make sense back in the

14

1 40's and fifties, when these studies were done, and then

15

there was never any contemplation that the law would apply

16

to public employers.

17

QUESTION:

But if we were to get into that, we

18

would be going considerably beyond where the Eighth

1

Circuit was in this case.
MR. RENICK:

20

That would be true, yes, but we

21

believe that, as I said, on the facts of this case this

demonstrates that -- and the Secretary has specifically

recognized that you don't treat law enforcement agencies

the same as even other public employees, let alone private

employees.

There are differences in the standards for hours

2

worked, there are differences in the fact that they get

compensatory time, and our point here is that this

disciplinary deduction prohibition doesn't make sense when

5

you try to fit it into this kind of a situation.

6

This is a -- as the trial judge found, this is a

7

quasimilitary organization, it would be my position, where

8

the sole or primary function of the St. Louis Police

9

Department is to ensure the public safety, that by

10

limiting our ability to impose discipline on the members

11

of that police department, that the Secretary of Labor, in

application, that that application is improper, it's

arbitrary, it's capricious, and should be invalid.

QUESTION:

That might be your dispute with the

Secretary of Labor, but it doesn't -- this case, your

victory in this case doesn't turn on --

It doesn't depend on that.

Our

position is that if you assume that the regulations and

the Secretary's interpretations are entirely valid in

their application to the St. Louis Police Board, that the

21

actions in this case demonstrate first of all the -- we

claimed that solely because they were subject to a

disciplinary action which might possibly include a

they are thus nonexempt, and we think --

Why does the distinction between

MR. RENICK:

QUESTION:

19

What's the theory of it?

Why does --

The Secretary --- suspended for a whole week,

not - MR. RENICK:

20

It's just included, a proviso that

21

says in a week in which an employee performs no work at

22

all, that the employer is under no obligation to pay the

23

salary.

24

to pay the full salary.

25

There are some distinctions as to when you have

The Secretary's interpretation is that

generally, if you perform any work at all within a week,

2

if you're a salaried employee, you shouldn't lok at the

number of hours.

4

your full salary.

5

in a week in which no work is performed, that the employer

6

need not pay the salary.

7

It shouldn't matter.

Then they draw the distinction and say,

Yes, but they also -- the docking

rule also applies.

9

even though you work.

10

MR. RENICK:

11

You're entitled to

A docking for a whole week is okay,

Docking for a whole week of work is

okay, according to the Secretary of Labor.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RENICK:

I don't understand that.
Well, we think that's even more so

14

demonstrated by the fact that in 1992 the Secretary of

15

Labor amended the regulation 541.5d that applies to public

16

employees, so that the salary basis test, if you read it,

17

doesn't even mean what it says for public employees,

18

because the salary basis test says you're supposed to

19

receive a predetermined amount of compensation every pay

20

period that is not subject to reduction based on quality

21

or quantity of work.

22

The Secretary of Labor, through a rulemaking

23

procedure in '91, looked at the outcry that this caused in

24

the public area, that there are many people who are

25

exempt, but because of principles of public accountability

are -- under State laws are not able to be paid for time

2

they don't work, so the Secretary amended the regulation

3

to specifically allow a public employer to make deductions

4

on an hour-by-hour basis from an otherwise exempt

5

employee's salary and still allow them to claim that

6

they're paid on a salary basis, which in and of itself is

7

inconsistent.

8

So the salary basis test as applied to public

9

employers no longer means what it says, and we say, why

10

should there be this disciplinary deduction aspect

11

maintained when the Secretary has already recognized that

12

the variation in quantity of work does not destroy the

13

salary basis.

14

I would also point out that, in the petition

15

that was filed by the petitioners in this case, they took

16

the position very clearly that this Court was required to

17

defer to the interpretations of the Secretary of Labor,

18

and this Court invited the views of the Government, asking

19

the Solicitor General to file a brief prior to deciding

20

whether or not to accept this case.

21

In that case, the Secretary of Labor's views

22

were specifically expressed, and it was described in that

23

brief as for the sole -- for the very specific purpose of

24

clarifying what the Secretary's position was on these

25

interpretations, and the Secretary has specifically

2

disagreed with the position taken by the petitioners.
But the petitioners continue nonetheless to have

3

had -- apparently have had a change of heart as to the

4

deference owed to the Secretary of Labor under the

5

circumstances, and we would submit that the -- whether or

6

not the Secretary's interpretations are agreeable to the

7

petitioner should not determine whether or not they are

8

entitled to deference in this case, and we believe, under

9

the circumstances, that they clearly are, and as I said

10

earlier, if you accept the Secretary's current

11

clarification of what the interpretations mean, this case

12

fits squarely within it, whether or not you get to the

13

window of correction.

14

If there are no other questions, thank you.
