ORAL ARGUMENT OF GWENDOLYN T. MOSLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. MOSLEY:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether due

12

process requires a public employer to provide a hearing in

13

every instance before suspending one of its employees

14

without pay.

15

The Third Circuit held that a Loudermill- type

16

hearing providing for hearing and a notice to be heard

17

must be given to an employee in every case before

18

suspending him without pay, regardless of the reasons for

19

the suspension, regardless of the governmental interests

20

involved, regardless of the purpose to be served, no

21

matter -- regarding the substantial assurance of

22

reliability, regardless of the duration of the suspension.

23

We think this is wrong.

We think that the

24

better rule is that which was announced in Mallen.

25

Mallen, the Court said an important governmental interest

In

1

accompanied by substantial assurance that the deprivation

2

is not without basis may, in limited circumstances,

3

justify the postponement of a hearing until after the

4

deprivation.

5

What we are asking for here is for the Court to

6

make explicit what was suggested in Mallen, that the

7

university's interest in the prompt removal of a police

8

officer arrested for drug-related charges justified Mr.

9

Homar's suspension without a hearing and without pay.

10

QUESTION:

So you would --

11

QUESTION:

Ms. Mosley --

12

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

13

QUESTION:

-- it was my understanding that the

14

Third Circuit wasn't saying you must have a full dress

15

hearing, just give the officer an opportunity to say why

16

he shouldn't be payless during the suspension period, just

17

an opportunity, I think the words were, to tell his side

18

of the story.
MS. MOSLEY:

19

Yes, Your Honor.

In this case,

20

we're suggesting that such an opportunity would be

21

useless.

22

In this particular case, we have -- in this

23

particular case, we have a police officer who was arrested

24

on very serious charges, and that particular arrest itself

25

required prompt action, just as in Mallen the Court said

1

that the mere fact of the arrest is enough to undermine

2

the public confidence and the public trust.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the problem, Ms. Mosley, is not

4

apparently on whether the suspension can occur.

5

see either side disagreeing that under these circumstances

6

the officer can be suspended.

7

I don't

I guess it really turns on whether there should

8

have been some opportunity promptly to discuss the pay

9

situation during the suspension, right?

I mean, that's

10

what we're really talking about, not whether there can be

11

a suspension, because I guess your opponents agree there

12

could be.

13

MS. MOSLEY:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

In our case, however --

And in this case, we've never had a

15

determination on the facts.

16

the charges were dismissed very promptly, but there was no

17

opportunity to discuss the pay situation for a while.

18

MS. MOSLEY:

I guess it turned out that

That's right.

What we're saying is

19

that there are important interests furthered by his prompt

20

suspension and his prompt suspension without pay.

21

The government had important interests at stake

22

here, not just the interest in promptly removing a police

23

officer following his arrest on drug-related charges, but

24

there was the interest in maintaining the public's

25

confidence in the integrity of the police force and the

1

police officers' confidence in the integrity of the police

2

force.

3
4

QUESTION:

So you do not apply this to every

State employee.
MS. MOSLEY:

5

With respect to the arrest on a

6

felony charge, we're saying that the arrest, or that the

7

suspension would be without pay, but we're suggesting -QUESTION:

8

9

employees, or just police officers?

10

MS. MOSLEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

So it's with respect to all

With all Commonwealth employees.
Well, is the suspension automatic?

I

mean, it seems to me that one of the things I think we're

3

arguing about in this case is whether you're really

4

applying this regulation, and the regulation that you set

5

out on page 3 of your brief makes the suspension automatic

6

on arrest.

7

There doesn't seem to be a substantive objection

8

to the regulation as such, so if it's this regulation

9

which is being applied, then the only real issue of fact

20

would be, was the person arrested or charged or not?

21

MS. MOSLEY:

22

QUESTION:

Correct.
And yet if I understand what the

23

other side is saying, they're saying that really isn't the

24

standard that they apply, that in fact it's -- number

25

it's not consistently applied.

,

Number 2, if it had been alone what was being

1

2

applied the individual would have been reinstated when the

3

charges were dropped, and he wasn't, and so they're saying

4

that the real issue in the case is - - or in the case of a

5

suspension is not whether there was an arrest or charge,

6

but something to do with the merits of the arrest or

7

charge, and if the latter point is true, then there really

8

is a lot more to talk about at a hearing than the mere

9

fact of the arrest or not.

10

Could you comment on that issue?

11

MS. MOSLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

What we're saying

12

is at the point of time when the suspension was made,

13

there was only one issue, and that issue was, was there an

14

arrest, and was the nature of the charge a felony, and -QUESTION:

15

And you apply the regulation to

16

everybody, and so far as you know, are there any

17

exceptions in the sense that the inquiry might have been

18

more far-ranging, or there might have been a - - an

19

exercise of discretion on the part of the suspending

20

authority?

21

Do you know of any such instances?
MS. MOSLEY:

As far as I know, Your Honor, there

22

is no discretion, and that this particular regulation is

23

applied in every instance involving an arrest of a

24

Commonwealth employee for a felony.

25

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if -- I'm sorry.

Go

1

ahead.
MS. MOSLEY:

2

Well,

the only issue then is, does

3

the employee's charge or arrest fall within that

regulation, and -QUESTION:

5

All right, but if that is so, and

6

that is the standard, why wasn't he simply reinstated when

7

the charges were dropped?

It was not

It was not addressed by the

you're relying on.

That sort of comes in -- it's barely

QUESTION:

but as a guide among other guides,

20

like it follows like the night the day.

wasn't how the personnel supervisor conceived it.

thought it was just one of the guides he had.

MS. MOSLEY:

that he considered.

2

that he has discretion, he was merely wrong.

3

However, insofar as he's suggesting

And also, we're saying that although we did not

4

place a great deal of emphasis on the existence of the

5

Governor's code, that is certainly referred to, and that

6

particular aspect relates only to the issue of the value

7

of additional process.

9

case.

That is the point of having that

What we're suggesting is, in the balance, when

10

11

you talk about the various factors that you're

12

considering, one of those factors is, what is the value of

13

having any additional process?

14

having the employee come in and say anything - QUESTION:

15

What is the value of

Well, but you don't have a balance,

16

because you began by telling us that this was a police

17

officer and that that's important, and I can understand

18

that.

19

MS. MOSLEY:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

Right.
But you say it applies across the

board to all employees.
MS. MOSLEY:

That's the rule you're defending.
Well, no.

What I'm suggesting is

23

that we have a rule, and there's no discretion, so as to

24

that element of the balance - -

QUESTION:

May I just make it clear?

You are

1

saying that the rule you want us to adopt is that there is

2

an across-the-board rule that is - - that meets

3

constitutional requirements for a State to suspend any

4

employee who is charged with a felony without a hearing

5

and without pay.

Isn't that your submission?

MS. MOSLEY:

6

What I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is

7

that where there's an important interest, and there's some

8

assurance that the reason for the action taken is not

9

without basis, and there's a need for prompt action, then

10

the court may, in those instances, suspend without --

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MOSLEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

You mean the State may.
The State may suspend without pay.
So then you're not arguing for the

broad rule that I suggested at the outset of my question.

15

MS. MOSLEY:

16

QUESTION:

No.
You don't need to defend a rule

17

across the board, I take it.

18

simply be limited to police officers.
MS. MOSLEY:

19

Your position here could

It could be, because clearly the

20

removal of a police officer on charges such as were

21

involved here is a very important issue.

22

not suggesting that the interests implicated by some other

23

employee might not also raise very fundamental, compelling

24

interests to warrant his or her suspension without pay as

25

well.

However, we're

What we're suggesting is that there -- we're not

1
2

really arguing for a new rule, or the announcement of any

3

new kind of approach in these types of cases.

4

saying is that the rules that have been in force, such as

5

the Mathews balancing test, and the rule that was

6

announced in Mallen, are adequate to deal with this

7

particular situation.
QUESTION:

8

10

What we're

Well, if you're going to have a case-

by-case rule for every employee, depending on who he or
she is, you might as well have a hearing.
MS. MOSLEY:

11

Well, Your Honor, one of the

12

reasons that we're suggesting that there would not have

13

been a need, or there would be no value, is that it really

14

does depend on what the purpose or the function of the

15

action is.

16

We're saying that there's nothing new with

17

respect to saying that due process is a flexible concept.

18

There is no rule that fits every single situation, and

19

that in fact the Court has suggested in Mallen, or in

20

Mathews and other cases that there is a balancing.

21

is a balancing in every single situation.

22

QUESTION:

There

What we want to - - I mean, what we

23

want to know is whether in this case there should have

24

been a hearing or not.

25

Right.

1

QUESTION:

And let me suggest an argument to you

2

and get your response to it.

3

If you had a regulation that provided every employee shall

4

be suspended upon arrest, suspended without pay upon

5

arrest, and you applied that across the board, and that

6

regulation as such was not attacked as somehow being

7

unconstitutional, then you would have an argument to the

8

effect that look, the only issue is whether there was an

9

arrest or not, and there's not likely to be a mistake

10
11

The argument would be this.

about that.
Or if you had a regulation that said, every

12

police officer shall be suspended upon arrest, you could

13

make the same argument.

14

there's an arrest.

15

The only question is whether

But if, in fact, this regulation, which seems to

16

cover everybody, does not in fact cover everybody, then,

17

at least, it seems to me there -- or the argument would

18

run that in any given case an employee could say, look, it

19

shouldn't apply to me.

20

You apply it to some, you don't apply it to

21

others, regardless of what it says on its face, and it

22

shouldn't apply to me, and that's a much -- I suppose a

23

much more complicated issue than whether there was an

24

arrest or not.

25

reason for having a pre-suspension hearing.

If that's the issue, there would be a good

1

What is your response to that?

2

MS. MOSLEY:

My response, Your Honor, is that

3

there are no facts in the record, or there are no facts of

4

which I am aware, that suggest this particular regulation

5

does not apply in every instance when there's been an

6

arrest of a Commonwealth employee and a charge of a

7

felony.

8

It is whether - -

In that particular case, the inquiry is the same.

QUESTION:
10

So you are going to defend it on the

grounds that it does apply to everybody.
MS. MOSLEY:

11

It does apply to everyone.

It does

12

apply to everyone, so the inquiry at the point of

13

consideration of what to do once you receive that

14

information is, you know, is this a Commonwealth employee,

15

has there been a formal charge, and is that charge a

16

felony?

17

QUESTION:

Had there been no Governor's code,

18

you would lose.

Is that -- then you're relying on the

1

Governor's code as the reason why there should be no

20

opportunity to tell his side of the story?
MS. MOSLEY:

21

No, we're not, Your Honor.

What

22

we're suggesting is, as I've stated, is there is a

23

balancing.

interest which we do have here.

1

arrest of this person, so there's no suggestion that the

2

action taken is baseless.

3

QUESTION:

Then what use is the Government code?

4

I'm really -- I'm having a hard time understanding what

5

use you're making of that.
Is it your position that the Government -- that

6

7

the Governor's code makes it unnecessary to have a

8

hearing, because it applies universally, however, you

9

concede that in some cases that may be unconstitutional?

10

Is that your position?
MS. MOSLEY:

11
12

No, I don't think that I'm

conceding that in some cases it could be unconstitutional.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. MOSLEY:

So you're -What I'm suggesting is that the

15

value or the purpose of our reliance on the Governor's

16

code is to suggest there is no discretion, so there's no

17

need for any hearing.

18

at that time.
QUESTION:

19

Any -- there's no point in dispute

So you are defending the proposition

20

that it is constitutional to fire, or to suspend without

21

pay, any State employee upon his or her arrest for a

felony?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN HUBBARD

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

4
5
6

MS. HUBBARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the Third Circuit's per se rule, any

7

public employee who is suspended without pay in advance of

8

a hearing is entitled to seek money damages for a

9

constitutional violation.

This is contrary to the Court's

10

precedents, and could impair the Federal Government's

11

interest in needed flexibility in employment matters.

12

Because of deficiencies in the record, however,

3

we believe the Court should reject the Third Circuit's

4

rules, vacate its judgment, and remand the case for

5

further proceedings.

6

I'd like to focus first on why Mallen and Barchi

7

tell us that a government may, in appropriate

8

circumstances, suspend an employee without pay and in

9

advance of the hearing.

20

QUESTION:

I take it, then, the rule you're

21

going to submit to us is that it depends on the nature of

22

the employee and the work that the employee does.

23

MS. HUBBARD:

Under Mallen and Barchi, and as

24

well under Mathews, you have to identify the government

25

interest in prompt action.

QUESTION:

1

So does the government -- the

2

government does not have an interest in suspending any

3

employee who's been arrested and charged with a felony

4

without a hearing and suspending without pay?

MS. HUBBARD:

MS. HUBBARD:

10

We think it's an easier case to

I know that.

That's why I'm asking.

It's unclear.

I'm not sure why

the -- that would be defensible.
QUESTION:

11

And is there a difference between the

12

suspension of duty, performance of duty and the

13

deprivation of pay?

14

MS. HUBBARD:

15

QUESTION:

16

Generally --

Might there be a different balance

between the two?
MS. HUBBARD:

17

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Generally,

18

if the government suspends an employee with pay it does

19

not implicate a protected property interest, so you would

20

not have to go through this balancing test.
We think Mallen and Barchi are properly

21
22

understood - QUESTION:

23

Why does the government have to give

24

somebody a paid vacation if they've been charged with a

25

felony?

MS. HUBBARD:

1

It doesn't if it can satisfy the

2

Mallen and Barchi test that it had a compelling interest

3

or adequate interest to suspend them.

4

QUESTION:

How does the government show this

5

compelling interest, other than if it's not a policeman,

6

if it's a groundskeeper?

MS. HUBBARD:

I think it would be harder with a

groundskeeper.

other circumstances -- if it's a bank director accused of

11

fraud.

I mean, this Court has already identified

If there's a public safety concern.
QUESTION:

That was a private individual.

I

12

mean, it's different when the government as regulator is

13

knocking a private individual out of his private job.

14

Can't the government have a policy and, indeed,

15

don't many governments have such a policy, we do not

16

employ felons, and if there's any suspicion of somebody

17

being a felon, you're off the payroll until that suspicion

18

is eliminated?

19
20
21

Why isn't that a reasonable rule?

I don't care

if you're a police officer or not.
MS. HUBBARD:

It may well be, Justice Scalia.

22

I'm not here to defend the Governor's code in all of its

23

applications.

24
25

What I'd like --

QUESTION:

Of course, if you continue paying the

charged felon, can the government get the money back?

What do you do bring a lawsuit to get back the money

if you continue paying the salary?

4

How much would it cost you to bring a lawsuit to

get back the pay that you -- I mean, it seems to me

6

there's a substantial government interest there, isn't

7

there?

8

9

MS. HUBBARD:

Justice Scalia, you have

identified one of the primary problems with the Third

10

Circuit rule.

11

Government constitutionally can suspend you, it

12

constitutionally is required to pay you in all instances,

13

and we think this is not compatible with the Court's

14

precedents or, indeed, with our basic understanding of the

15

employment relationship.

16

The effect of the rule is that even if the

QUESTION:

One of the benefits of the Third

17

Circuit's rule, and one of the benefits of the contrary

18

rule -- either you can suspend without pay, or -- is that

19

it avoids all the kind of building castles in the air and

20

factual analyses that you don't know when the supervisor

21

first confronts a situation -- if he has to go through

22

some Mathews balancing test every time, it's not very

23

workable in the real world.

24
25

MS. HUBBARD:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

and we believe that where there's any doubt about which

1

way the balance would tip, the prudent employer can

2

protect itself by suspending the person with pay for the

3

time necessary to decide whether or not further action is

4

warranted.
QUESTION:

5

By suspending the person with pay.

6

So you're saying that the presumption should be that you

7

can only suspend with pay, unless there's no -- unless the

8

Mathews balance is undoubtedly in favor of the State.

9

That's the rule you propose?
MS. HUBBARD:

10

No, Justice Kennedy.

We're saying

11

that the employer always has the option to dispel any

12

constitutional doubt by suspending the employee with pay,

3

but if the employer concludes that this is one of those

4

cases that falls within Mallen and Barchi and it is

5

permissible to suspend the employee without pay, then if

6

that determination is correct, it should not be liable for

7

damages.

QUESTION:

Well, if you can't tell us whether

the cases are easy or hard, how is the employee's
supervisor to do it?

I mean, it's --

MS. HUBBARD:

We think there -- it is the nature

of a balancing test that there will be hard cases, and -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

1

But just pursuing the Chief Justice's

2

point for a moment, if you took the Third Circuit's rule

3

and said that's the law, you can't take his pay away until

4

you at least give him an opportunity to give his side of

5

the story, he can -- you can do that in a day or two, so

6

it may be that only a day or two's pay is at stake in this

7

huge constitutional fight, because if you called him up

8

and said, hey, Joe, what happened, and he tells you his

9

story, he says, I'm sorry, that's not enough, you're

10

arrested, you're off the payroll.
MS. HUBBARD:

11

That's very often the case,

12

Justice Stevens.

This is the minimal Loudermill hearing,

13

and it would not in most cases be so burdensome to call

14

the employer in.
QUESTION:

15

So we're not talking about indefinite

16

pay.

17

necessary in order to give the fellow a chance to tell his

18

side of the story.

19

We're talking about pay for the 2 or 3 days that's

MS. HUBBARD:

That's absolutely correct, but we

20

do believe that if this is a Mallen-Barchi case and the

21

government was justified in suspending him without a

22

hearing, even during that period between the suspension

23

and the hearing, if the suspension was lawful in that he

24

was given all the process he was due, the employer is not

25

constitutionally required to pay him.

1

property right at issue here is the right to continue to

2

work and to earn a living.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Hubbard, you went through a lot

4

of ifs, and I -- following up Justice Stevens' question,

5

if the employee is arguing all I want is a chance to tell

6

my side of the story, all that's involved -- all that's at

7

stake for the government is a couple of days, at most, of

8

my pay, why doesn't any balance work in favor of the

9

employee?

10

The government can take him out of the job, and

11

the only question is the pay for a couple of days.

12

doesn't the employee win on that kind of balance?

13

MS. HUBBARD:

Why

It might well, but in the balance

14

that you're proposing, you're positing 1 or 2 days' pay.

15

In other cases it may take longer to resolve the issue, as

16

in Mallen or Barchi, for instance.

17

QUESTION:

But if you say the only process

18

that's due is a chance to tell his side of the story,

19

period, no full evidentiary hearing.

20

MS. HUBBARD:

That can come later.

Right, but there may be government

21

justifications for having to postpone even a Loudermill-

22

style hearing for a week or two, and we're just saying

23

that the Court needs to use its framework for balancing

24

those questions.

MR. FARERI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I'd like to begin by speaking about this

25

by the Commonwealth in this case.

feel that he was obliged to follow the Governor's code of

conduct.

6

of conduct is not even relevant for the determination as

7

to what quantum of due process should have been afforded

8

Mr. Homar under these facts.

9

If you look in the joint

I would submit to you that the Governor's code

QUESTION:

Well, maybe we should leave that

10

issue for the circuit or the district court on remand.

11

we were to do that, let me ask you what your answer to

12

this question would be.

If

3

If we assume that the Governor's code of conduct

4

requiring the automatic suspension at least applies to all

5

law enforcement officers and should be, by its terms,

6

enforced, then the only issue would be in a given case

7

whether, in fact, there had been an arrest or a charge.

8

20
21

Under those circumstances, do you believe that a
pre- suspension hearing is necessary if pay is not to be
continued during the suspension?
MR. FARERI:

If pay is not to be continued, yes,

Your Honor, because that would be an issue, as to whether

23

or not the individual can continue to receive his pay.

1

charge, and is that the kind of issue upon which there is

2

a sufficient risk of error to require the pre-termination,

3

the pre-suspension hearing?

4

I mean, there's a pretty good argument that that

5

issue is so simple, it's so unlikely that there is going

6

to be a mistake about that, that it really would be

7

justified to say no, the hearing could take place

8

afterwards.

9

MR. FARERI:

I would concede that if the

10

Governor's code of conduct is in the case and it is

11

supportable and it is constitutional, then I would agree

12

with you, Justice Souter, on that point.

13

It is our position in this case that the general

14

rule crafted by the court of appeals below is

15

fundamentally correct.

16

that.

17

such a rule in order to affirm the holding below.

18

the result reached below may be obtained by applying the

19

three Mathews factors to the facts of the case, and I'd

MR. FARERI:

I think in one of the amicus

briefs, Your Honor, there's a study that indicates that

5

approximately a third of all wage earners in this country

6

now live essentially from paycheck to paycheck.

7

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there something to be

8

said for a rule that's more or less automatic, rather than

9

requiring the supervisor to sit down in each case and read

10

a study like this that says a third of these people -- and

11

trying to figure out whether this employee was in that

12

third or not, for either saying that with respect to a

13

police officer you can suspend upon arrest without pay or

14

perhaps, as the Third Circuit says, you can't suspend.

15

There are just a great deal of transactional costs in this

16

balancing test.

MR. FARERI:

Mr. Chief Justice, I couldn't agree

18

with you more.

Mathews balance in each and every case.

21

that is completely unworkable in the real world.

22

That's why we think that the rule crafted

Mr. Fareri, the -- that rule, the

automatic rule that there must be some opportunity to tell

the only issue is whether a law enforcement officer had

MR. FARERI:

We didn't, Mr. Chief Justice, the

reason being, again, we feel strongly that the rule is not

in the case, because the personnel director himself

5

testified that he did not rely on the rule.

6

And additionally, as one of the members of the

7

Court indicated when they were asking counsel for the

State a question, after the -- all charges were dismissed,

9

and all charges were dismissed 6 days after his arrest for

10

insufficient evidence after a preliminary hearing, the

human resources director continued on with his suspension

for a period of 23 days, during which Mr. Homar did not

receive his pay.

MR. FARERI:

QUESTION:

I take it Judge Serokin wrote, a

He means never, all right?
Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

So I would like to know

10

whether there aren't some circumstances where you could

your response.
QUESTION:

11

Your Honor, I think even in those

12

circumstances where it's absolutely clear that there's

13

been some wrongdoing on the part of the employee that

14

there is always a value to the pre-suspension process.
And I think the reason there should be pre-

16

suspension process is because the wage earner's interest

17

in his employment is so critical and so important, and

18

sometimes a matter of being able to support himself and

19

his family, and the skin off the nose of the government,

20

so to speak, is so slight, because what we're talking

Suppose in one of Justice Breyer's hypotheticals

that the employee does - - who has the burden - - I take it

that you're saying that in every case the employer must

take the initiative, even if the employee didn't ask to

have any kind of pre-deprivation hearing.

6

MR. FARERI:

Is that so?

I would say yes, Justice Ginsburg,

7

because I think there are some employees who probably

aren't sophisticated enough to ask for one, and I think

because the governmental employer is in the position of

he didn't ask if he could have a hearing.

15

MR. FARERI:

That's correct, and that

16

exemplifies what I'm saying.

I don't think he had the

17

knowledge to know that he was even entitled to that, and

18

he didn't understand what his rights were until after he

consulted counsel, which was sometime after that.

Mr. Fareri,

I guess there are two

One is whether you need a

that we face in this case.

2

We think that the Court's cases are quite clear

3

that in order to satisfy its burden of denying somebody a

4

pre-deprivation hearing the government has to show that

5

there is a significant administrative burden, and the

6

argument that we hear today is really a general argument

7

that suggests that, as Justice Breyer put it, we can't do

8

this because if we do the public will be outraged.

9

We don't denigrate or trivialize the argument

10

that's made by the State, but we think that the long

11

experience of the Federal Government's practice defeats

12

the argument, because the fact of the matter is, the rule

3

that we advocate here today has been the routine practice

4

for many, many years, and there has been no suggestion at

5

any point that the public has in any way been outraged.

Justice Scalia, are you --

the Federal budget doing?

MR. O'DUDEN:

MR. O'DUDEN:

1

No, I don't think it translates

2

into that at all, and I think there's one other important

3

thing to be kept in mind here.

4

is avoided, what does that do?

5

If an erroneous decision

That saves the government money, because it

6

means that in that situation the employer doesn't have to

7

go out and hire a substitute, and it doesn't have to

8

expend the resources to train that substitute and, of

9

course, it also means that it avoids what could be the

10

very significant cost of having to pay that employee back

11

pay.
QUESTION:

12

If it is in fact in the government's

13

best interest to do that, presumably the government will

14

do that without being told that the Constitution requires

15

it.

16

MR. O'DUDEN:

Well, I wish the world were that

17

simple, Your Honor.

18

Goss v. Lopez that notwithstanding the good intentions of

19

those who are in a position to impose discipline, it often

doesn't work out that way, and that's why we have the

Constitution, to defend citizens, to defend employees from

22

deprivations of their property.

23

QUESTION:

I think that the Court recognized in

It's not a -- I don't think it's a

good constitutional argument to say this is really not

MR. O'DUDEN:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, Your Honor --

The employer presumably can look out

for his own best interest.
MR. O'DUDEN:

The reason that we're talking

6

about the employer's interest at all is, of course, we're

7

faced with having to deal with the Mathews test, and

8

therefore we're having to respond to the government's

9

assertion that their interests are somehow compromised by

10
11
12

4

giving somebody a pre-deprivation hearing.
I think it's important in looking at this case
for all of us to keep in mind what the due process
framework here is.
QUESTION:

Well, what -- let's keep in mind what

the suspended person here would argue at the hearing.

What would you expect him to argue at the hearing?

1

have a policy that all State employees, or at least police

2

officers, will be suspended if they're under indictment.

3

We do not want indicted police officers walking around

4

enforcing the law, and since they're not going to be

5

walking around enforcing the law, we're not going to pay

6

them.

7

That seems pretty reasonable to me.
MR. O'DUDEN:

Well, of course, that's not the

8

policy that we're talking about in this case, Your Honor.

What we're talking about here is a code, as my --

Okay.

You're moving now to a

QUESTION:

we can let the lower court resolve it.

policy that at least police officers will be suspended

without pay if they are under indictment, what would the

MR. O'DUDEN:

that he could have argued is that the policy was

1

Does he have any other argument?

2

MR. O'DUDEN:

Well, in essence what your

hypothetical sets up is a situation where there is no

point to the hearing.

5

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. O'DUDEN:

it's constitutional --

(Laughter.)

MR. O'DUDEN:

Well, I'm --

Okay, and you're assuming that

So you're talking all of the

10

arguments out of the employee's hands.

11

obviously, there is no -QUESTION:

12

In that case,

Well, Mathews v. Eldridge hearings

13

are not to determine what's constitutional or not.

14

They're to determine what the facts are under a balancing

15

test.

16

MR. O'DUDEN:

17

QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.

And if we hypothesize that it's an

18

adequate and defensible interest for the government not to

19

have police officers who are under criminal charges

20

enforcing the law then it is constitutional, so I think

21

you're avoiding the question when you say what the hearing

22

is going to establish.

23

MR. O'DUDEN:

No.

I think I said that if those

24

were the facts, then there would be little point to the

25

hearing at all.

In fact, there would be no point to the

hearing.

2

But I do want to emphasize that those are not - -

3

QUESTION:

Well, so then you have to say that

4

it's unlawful for the State to have the policy of

5

suspending officers that are under criminal charges.
MR. O'DUDEN:

6

Ultimately he would be reduced to

7

making that kind of argument.

8

QUESTION:

9

pay -- without pay.

No, you mean suspending without

10

MR. O'DUDEN:

11

QUESTION:

Suspending without pay, yes.

It's an argument you're perfectly

12

willing to make.

13

that it is unconstitutional to suspend - -

14

I mean, you think that that's the case,

MR. O'DUDEN:

Yes, given the fact -- given what

15

this Court has said about the significance of the fact of

16

an arrest.

17

QUESTION:

Certainly a supervisor isn't in a

18

position to make any intelligent, informed decision about

19

whether a policy is constitutional or not.

talking about this very quick telephone call and the guy

21

at the other end says, of the telephone says, your

22

policy's unconstitutional.

1

may well give the supervisor pause before he goes ahead

2

and imposes that action.

3

QUESTION:

Well, you're -- I take it that -- I

4

don't want to put words in your mouth -- that you're

5

saying there's no circumstance in which simply phoning the

6

person before suspending him without pay and to say, is

7

there some exceptional circumstance, is there something to

8

your side of the story, you're saying that that's always

9

required.

10

MR. O'DUDEN:

11

QUESTION:

I'm sorry --

It could be very simple.

It could be

12

very simple, a telephone call, what's your point -- what's

13

your point of view.

Is that --

14

MR. O'DUDEN:

That's right.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. O'DUDEN:

17

With respect to the Mallen case, since that has

That's basically what you're arguing.
Yes, Your Honor, that is.

18

come up here, I do want to emphasize in my remaining

19

moments that Mallen does not reach the issue that is

20

presented here.

21

Mallen obviously turned on the Court's very real

22

concern about there being an actual government interest

23

that was going to be jeopardized, namely, public

24

confidence in the banks, the concern about protecting bank

25

depositors.

There was a congressional finding on - 55

QUESTION:

1

Well, there's a much greater

2

interest, of course, in assuring the public that their

3

police officers are not indicted for felonies.

4

MR. O'DUDEN:

5

QUESTION:

6

There is a public interest --

I think the policy is at least as

great, if not significantly greater than in Mallen.

7

MR. O'DUDEN:

Your Honor, as the Solicitor

8

General points out, that interest is addressed by removing

9

the employee from his duties.

It does not follow from

10

that, however, that the State has established an adequate

11

justification to deprive that employee of his pay.

12

is a separate matter, and those justifications that are

13

asserted here by the government do not justify its summary

14

deprivation of the employee's pay.
QUESTION:

15

That

Mr. O'Duden, is this something that a

16

union could bargain about with the public employer, say,

17

now we want to have a code.

18

course, but you have to have some kind of hearing before

19

you take away their pay.
MR. O'DUDEN:

20

You can suspend people, of

Yes, and in fact the record here

21

does show that the employee here did in fact grieve under

22

the collective bargaining procedures his suspension, and

23

that is yet another fact that belies the petitioner's

24

last-minute argument here that this code is actually

25

binding.

We think it's very clear, based on the

1

2

undisputed record in this case, that this Governor's code

3

was in no way binding on the petitioners.

4

wasn't binding on the decisionmakers, and the university's

5

own rules of conduct, if I may make one final point, they

6

provide that before a person is to be suspended, he is to

7

be given an opportunity to be heard in his defense.

8

again is in the record of this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

9

It obviously

That

But if this is a bargainable subject,

10

then I take it what you're asking for here is to say the

11

Constitution takes care of it, the union doesn't have to

12

bargain for it, so the union can bargain for other things,

13

because the Constitution will require in every case some

14

kind of hearing before pay is removed.
MR. O'DUDEN:

15
16

I'm sorry, I'm not sure that I

follow --

17

QUESTION:

You answered my question --

18

MR. O'DUDEN:

19

QUESTION:

Okay.

-- earlier that a union could bargain

20

with a public employer not to take away people's pay

21

without some kind of hearing.

22

is, if the Due Process Clause does that job, then the

23

union doesn't have to bargain for it.

24

something else.

25

MR. O'DUDEN:

Now, what I'm saying to you

It can bargain for

That's quite right.

It puts it in

1

the position of being able to focus on whatever post­

2

deprivation procedures may be warranted.

3

that it would not have to bargain for those pre-

4

deprivation rights.

It would mean

That is quite correct, Your Honor.
