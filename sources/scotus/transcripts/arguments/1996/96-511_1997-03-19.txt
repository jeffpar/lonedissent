Mr. Waxman and Mr. Ennis, I would like to tell

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
The Internet is a revolutionary advance in

16

information technology.

17

means for displaying patently offensive, sexually explicit

18

material to children in the privacy of their homes.

19

It also provides a revolutionary

With as many as 8,000 sexually explicit sites on

20

the World Wide Web alone at the time of the hearing, and

21

the number estimated to double every 9 months, the

22

Internet threatens to render irrelevant all prior efforts

23

to protect children from indecent material.

All of the laws regulating the display of
indecent materials in theaters and book stores, on radio,

TV, cable, and telephone, all of these approach

2

insignificance when the Internet threatens to give every

3

child with access to a connected computer a free pass into

4

the equivalent of every adult bookstore and video store in

5

the country.
Congress debated for a year-and-a-half before

6

7

enacting the Communications Decency Act which, as we

8

explain in our brief, contains three distinct provisions.

9

Let me go right to the broadest one, which

10

prohibits the display of patently offensive material "in a

11

manner available to a person under 18 years of age."

12

When read together with the statutory --

16

MR. WAXMAN:

That is (d)(1)(A)?
That is (d)(l)B).
(d)(1)(B).

Thank you.

When read together with the

17

statutory defenses, this provision permits persons to post

18

indecent material on the Internet so long as they take

19

reasonably effective steps not to expose it to children.
The district court found that on the World Wide

20
21

Web, where most of the material that concerned Congress is

22

posted, it is technologically feasible for speakers to

23

screen for age, and on commercial sites that is commonly

24

done.

Even as to noncommercial sites, the evidence

showed that the technology exists, and is operating, to

2

provide adults with a verification code that allows them

3

to access adult-only sites at no cost to those who post

information on those sites.

MR. WAXMAN:

10

It does --

The -- Justice O'Connor, the

11

mechanism by which a Web site can screen for age, or a

12

particular page, or indecent material on a Web site could

13

screen for age is, or at least at the time of the hearing

14

was by the use of something called CGI script.
But the obtaining of an adult ID is something

15
16

that the unrebutted evidence showed was a service that

17

even at the time of the hearing, without the benefit of

18

the Communications Decency Act in effect, an adult,

19

somebody over 18 who wanted to view patently offensive

20

material on a screen site could, for $5 a year, obtain an

21

adult identification that would give that person access to

22

any and all adult sites, and -QUESTION:

23

Of course, the problem is not at that

24

end.

It is at the other end.

How can a person putting

25

material out in the system assure that it's only going to

2

be accessible by somebody with that code?
MR. WAXMAN:

Exactly, and what the record --

3

what the district court found as fact was that on the

4

World Wide Web it is technologically feasible and

5

economically feasible, either by use of a credit card,

6

which is more expensive, or by requiring the punching in

7

of an adult ID code that is available from a third party

8

for as little as $5 a year, to get access, but the

9

technology on the World Wide Web exists to display this.

10

QUESTION:

Well, how does that fit in with use

11

of Web sites by noncommercial users, or just private

12

individuals or libraries, or something of that kind?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Do you mean use, that is that they

14

want to view material, or use that they want to post

15

indecent material?

16

QUESTION:

Both.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

Okay.
I mean, the library wants to have

19

material on its Web site which might be viewed as

20

indecent, I guess.

material --

We're not talking about obscene

category of material.

MR. WAXMAN:

3

Let me address the example of the

library.

4

QUESTION:

And while you're at it, I want you to

5

tell me how -- what percentage of Web sites are incapable

6

of using this CGI script, do you think?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

9
10

Okay.

Let me --

Not all of them can use it, and so

I -MR. WAXMAN:

Well, let me answer your second

11

question first and then go to your library example, but

12

the testimony in the record before the district court was

13

that on -- for certain third party access providers like

14

America Online and CompuServe, which allow customers to

15

create their own Web sites for free, they do not currently

16

have CGI software, so for example I, I am a member of

17

America Online.

18

have to go to somebody else.

19

If I want to create my own Web page I

There are hundreds, if not thousands of servers

20

that you can go to to create a Web page.

21

write my own Web page on something other than America

22

Online, or of course America Online could simply adopt CGI

23

script, which at the time of the hearing at least it had

24

chosen not to do.

25

I would have to

Now, as to the library, the Carnegie Library is

1

an appellee in this case, and it is a very good example of

2

what we think represents the overblown nature of the

3

challenge to this act.

4

The library wants to do two things.

It wants to

5

put its card catalogue on line so that anybody anywhere in

6

the country can see what it is that the Carnegie Library

7

has, and it also wants to put on line journals and

8

abstracts that it in turn receives on line in an electric

9

form.
Now, the definition, the accepted definition of

10
11

what is patently offensive, that is a term of art.

12

very narrow, and it is exceedingly difficult to see how it

13

would apply to more than a handful of cards in a card

14

catalogue, but to the extent that it does, you can simply

15

run it through some sort of word processor or computer

16

program to screen -- it's only text, after all, on cards,

17

and if you find a card that -QUESTION:

to the first point that you were answering, because I'm

puzzled.

21

and this is at 929 F.Supp. 846 to 847 -- found as a fact

22

that noncommercial organizations particularly would find

23

age verification prohibitively expensive and that indeed,

24

in the Shea case, that same fact-finding was made.

25

I thought the district court found as a fact --

MR. WAXMAN:

That is correct, and we do not

1

think that that finding, as we read it, Justice Ginsburg,

2

is either clearly in error or in error at all.
What the court found, though, was that for

3
4

noncommercial Web sites -- that is, people who aren't

5

businesses that want to post speech on the World Wide

6

Web -- it would be prohibitively expensive to create their

own adult validation system.

9

have the F.2d site, but that was not the only -- or

10

F.Supp. site.

That is the finding that the

Sorry.

That was not the only other alternative.

11

We put

12

on -- in response to their claim that the Communications

13

Decency Act acts as a ban, we put on evidence showing that

14

even prior -- even before the CBA came into effect there

15

were third party entities that on line would provide any

16

adult with an adult number for a fee of between $5 and

17

$9.95 a year, at no cost to the person who wants to create

18

their own Web site and put indecent material on it, which

19

would allow you to go to any of those Web sites, or any of

20

those pages, punch in your number and get access to it,

21

and there was -- that evidence is unrebutted on the

22

record.

23

So while we don't challenge the court's findings

24

that if people like you or I wanted to post our -- or

nonprofit organizations wanted to create their own adult

2

challenge the adequacy of that finding to support the

3

conclusion that this statute is unconstitutional on its

face.

clarification about your specific example of the

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- the library posting a card that

10

they know would violate the statute if it is read by an --

11

17-year-old.

12

that you are describing?

people who have access to adult material.

14

anybody who does not have that cannot see it?

Now, what does this software do exactly,

MR. WAXMAN:

It identifies all the adult

patently offensive, they would take the --

QUESTION:

Let's assume they know something

would be, so it -MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Let's assume there's that.

22

If they had that, what they would do is, with respect to

23

those cards, or those journals that they know to be

24

patently offensive, they would put them in a little

25

section of their Web site in which to get access to it.

So that everyone who does not have

So that in order to get access to

that if you're a viewer, you have to do whatever's

necessary to become an identified adult.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

It's the exact

10

analogy to what may very well happen to the Carnegie

11

Library itself in Pittsburgh.

QUESTION:

If I -- if you ask

No, but my motive is that I'm Anthony

telling you I've got a 17-year-old son who's going to help

MR. WAXMAN:

Then I -- then under the specific

child and transmission provisions as well as the display

13

provision, you could not send it, but there is nothing

to -- there is nothing in this act that in any way gets in

15

the way of adult-to-adult communication.

16

I may very well find that my 16-year-old son in

17

my judgment, in my responsibilities rearing my child,

18

should be able to see material that a jury would find

19

patently offensive, and I can certainly do that.

You're saying that any adult has a

QUESTION:

Yes.

And it seems to me if you're sending

it to the adult and he says, by the way, I'm going to have

a child watching, you're not sending it to the child.

MR. WAXMAN:

That is -You're sending it to the adult.
That is absolutely right.

communications and speech that is patently offensive as

that term of art has come to be understood.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I even imagine high

each other either singly or in groups.

MR. WAXMAN:

Wouldn't there then be a - My point, if I could just finish,

7

Justice Breyer, there is something that is -- there is a

8

deadly serious point here, and that is that when the

9

alternative is that every child in this country who has

10

access to a computer and can click a mouse has access in

11

his or her own bedroom or home or library to Hustler

12

Magazine and Penthouse Magazine, and the kind of indecent

13

speech that people sitting in the anonymity of their own

14

bedrooms anywhere in the world or anywhere in the country

15

wants to make available to them, we think that this is a

small price to pay, and Congress could legitimately say

that this is a narrowly tailored alternative.

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

9

The point of my -And that's what this is about.
Mr. Waxman, you know, there was once

prevalent throughout this country a kind of ordinance that

10

went like this.

It made it a misdemeanor to use offensive

11

language in the presence of women and children.

12

I was wondering while you were speaking whether you

3

were saying the assumption that those laws are no longer

4

tenable would flunk the First Amendment, that that's not a

5

correct assumption.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Those laws, Justice Ginsburg, are

7

distinguishable in two very fundamental ways, and it's

8

critical, I think, to this case.

9

One, this Court has recognized that, as opposed

20

to minors, there is a constitutional right to make

21

indecent, patently offensive speech to adults, and insofar

22

as this was trying to protect women from hearing such

23

speech, that would be unconstitutional.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

The notion in those laws --

3

this is my second point -- of what is offensive was I

4

think subject to a very serious vagueness challenge.

5

What we have here is a definition of patently

6

offensive material that is not vague,

that has been held

7

by this Court and the FCC and the lower courts not to be

8

constitutionally vague, and we have set out at page 17 of

9

10

would have to be instructed in determining whether

11

something was patently offensive under their prevailing

It didn't find that, and the reason is that with

hundreds of thousands of Web sites and tens of millions of

9

pages that can be discretely accessed, and with the number

10

of sites increasing so rapidly, and the ability to change

companies like SurfWatch or parents can keep up with what

significantly, without finding that any more narrowly

MR. WAXMAN:

2

Justice Ginsburg, all I can say is

3

that -- I mean, I could rattle off the name of a dozen or

4

two dozen cases in which this Court in either the

5

overbreadth context of the vagueness context has done just

6

that even without a severability clause, and when there is

7

a severability clause that includes the language of

8

applications as well as provisions, this Court has always

9

heeded that.
In fact, in Wyoming v. Oklahoma where the

10

11

request was that, okay, if it's invalid as to one

12

particular company, just strike them out, what this Court

13

said was, severability clauses may easily be written to

14

provide that if application of a statute to some classes

15

is found unconstitutional, severance of those classes

16

permits application to the acceptable classes.

17

QUESTION:

Now --

It was my impression from Califano v.

Westcott, which I think is the last time the Court dealt

exclude, you can put a caret mark, but nothing fancier

And the

First, the District Court found as fact that the

CDA completely bans a vast amount of speech, all of which

is constitutionally protected for adults, from all of the

World Wide Web, and effectively bans that speech from most

The argument is not, as it was in

That's not the case here.

The only thing prohibited is clearly

10

11

constitutionally prohibitable.

12

but in prohibiting what is prohibitable, you've done it in

13

such a fashion that you -- you needlessly, unnecessarily,

14

effectively prohibit non-prohibitable speech -- that is,

speech to adults.

And your argument is, ah,

That's -- that's a new case for us.

And I wonder whether it isn't true that you have

we're prohibiting these communications to minors, it's

We don't challenge

Never mind obscene -- pornographic -Pornographic --- succeeds in excluding children

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Scalia, the way the Internet

works, a child using a search engine can sit down at their

typewriter and they type in, if they want to go somewhere

16

-- and it's important to stress that in cyberspace,

listeners must affirmatively choose where they want to go.

The Government's expert testified that the odds are slim

19

that a child would come across a sexually explicit site by

20

accident.

21

the child sits down and types in something like "triple-X

22

sex."

23

But if a child wants to go to an indecent site,

If that home computer is not using parental

5

MR. ENNIS:

It doesn't specifically address that

question at all, Justice Kennedy.

Which is a big problem.

7

Because there was evidence in the record below that if

8

this law were upheld, so that it completely suppressed all

indecent speech by all domestic speakers, it would be very

20

simple for commercial purveyors of sexually explicit

speech to move all of their operations abroad.
