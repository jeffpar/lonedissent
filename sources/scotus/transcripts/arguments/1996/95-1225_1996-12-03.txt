CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 95-1225, United States v. Marian Brockamp.
Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9
10

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In these companion cases a divided panel of the

11

court of appeals held that equitable tolling may be

12

applied to enlarge or suspend the statutory periods that

13

limit the time for filings and the amount of recovery that

14

may be had on tax refund claims.

15

As we recount in our brief, recent decisions of

16

the First, Fourth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held

17

to the contrary.

18

circuits reach a result that is required by the text of

19

the interrelated statutory provisions that govern here,

20

and I would like to turn to the statutory text now, which

21

is set out at pages 2 to 4 of the Government's brief.

22

Our submission is that those four

And we start with the last of the provisions

23

that set out section 7422(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,

24

which the term before last in United States v. Williams

25

this Court referred to as a provision that requires

administrative exhaustion.

2

QUESTION:

This is found on page 4?

3

MR. WALLACE:

On page 4 of the Government's

4

brief, in the gray covers, and it says that no suit or

5

proceeding shall be maintained in any courts, skipping

6

down, until -- for a refund, until a claim for refund or

7

credit has been duly filed with the Secretary according to

8

the provisions of law in that regard.

9

And the controlling provisions in our view are

10

those set forth on the preceding two pages, the various

11

provisions of section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code,

12

and -- and that section starts off in subsection (a) with

13

a statement of a period of limitation on filing a refund

14

claim with the Internal Revenue Service.

15

For present purposes, since a tax return is

16

required for an income tax, the claim must be filed within

17

3 years from the time the return was filed, or 2 years

18

from the time the tax was paid.

19

QUESTION:

May I ask what might be an irrelevant

20

question on that point, but would help with my

21

understanding of the statute?

22

Apparently, in their brief on page 18 it did say

23

as first enacted it said it's within 3 years from the time

24

the return was required to be filed, and when you read the

25

statute -- the same thing came up I think last year, you

know, in a different case.

2

MR. WALLACE:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes.

And I've never been able to

understand the statute for that reason.

5

MR. WALLACE:

6

QUESTION:

In the Mundy case.

And it left those words, was

7

required, out, and then it seems as if you could file a

8

return like, 82 years later, and 82 years later, now, it's

9

not too late, and they start the statute running, but the

10
11
12

grab-back only goes back 2 or 3 years.
QUESTION:

Why don't you get these things

amended for us, Mr. Wallace, so they can make some sense?

3

(Laughter.)

MR. WALLACE:

duties that I have --

QUESTION:

Well, that's not part of the

-- but the Government is looking into

the possibility of statutory amendment.

QUESTION:

The question is,

Well, didn't -- wasn't there a

provision offered for amending this very section?
MR. WALLACE:

There hasn't actually been a

23

provision offered.

24

provision was being prepared --

25

Now, what was --

QUESTION:

There was an announcement that a

MR. WALLACE:

1

-- for offering, but it still has

not been offered.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WALLACE:

Is it still being prepared, though?
Well, there are -- it's under

5

study.

6

inherent difficulties in addressing this question because

7

of the massive number of returns that are filed every

8

year, difficulties that we've referred to in this --

9

I'm not privy to the discussions.

QUESTION:

There are

Was it just an accident they left out

10

the words, were required, or was required, or is some

11

purpose going on that I can't understand?

12

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we don't really have an

13

answer to that.

14

explanation of why this change occurred in the text.

There was, so far as I am aware, no

15

This is a question that in the Mundy case last

16

term the Court found no occasion to reach, and it seldom

17

makes a difference, because it can make a difference only

18

if the -- in a 1-year period, because either you can --

19

you can go back 3 years from when the return was filed to

20

see -- to ask for refunds of taxes paid during those 3

21

years, or else 2 years after the tax was paid, and usually

22

with a really late-filed return no taxes were paid within

23

the 3 years or the 2 years, and it makes no difference, as

24

it makes no difference in either of the cases before us.

25

In any event, let me proceed now to the next

1

provision, and for our purposes the more important

2

provision, subsection (b), which appears on page 3 of the

3

Government's brief, and it starts off with a subsection

4

( ), which states quite unequivocally the consequences if

5

the claim is not filed within the prescribed period.

6

credit or refund shall be allowed.

7

No

Now, that -- it's hard to see that that

8

provision has much purpose other than to emphasize the

9

strictness of the filing requirements and, as we point out

10

on page 20 of our brief, this point is reemphasized in

11

another provision of the code, section 65 4(a)( ), which

12

states that any credit or refund which the Service

3

actually gives on a claim that is filed after the

4

expiration of the statutory periods of limitation is

5

"erroneous" and "considered void."

6

And it's interesting that in the implementing

7

regulation for that provision, section 65 4, the Service,

8

after tracking the language of the statute, then has a

9

cross-reference to the provisions authorized in suit by

20

21

the Government to recover erroneous refunds.
But the next subsection seems to us to be what I

22

might refer to as the clincher, the most dispositive

23

obstacle to the respondents and the Ninth Circuit's

24

position in this case, and that is subsection (2) of

25

subsection (b), which is captioned, Limit on the amount of

1

credit or refund that can be given, and I cannot emphasize

2

too strongly that these caps on the disbursement that can

3

be made from the Federal Treasury have their own express

4

limitation.

5

While there is a cross-reference to the claims

6

limitation period for purpose of separating categories of

7

claims, there is no cross-reference to the claims

8

limitation for purpose of defining the cap itself.

9

It says in subsection (A), for example, the

10

amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of

11

the tax paid within a period defined right in this

12

provision equal to 3 years plus the period of any

13

extension of time for filing the return, and in subsection

14

(B) it's the same thing, that the amount of credit or

15

refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during

16

the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim.

17
18
19

These are substantive limitations on
disbursements from the Treasury that are authorized.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, can I ask you a

20

general -- assume we agree with every -- all of your

21

arguments, and that it's too late to file a claim and the

22

taxpayer, or this person, he's not really a taxpayer, I

23

guess, has no right to get the money back, is there

24

anything in the code that would allow the Internal Revenue

Service when presented with facts as extreme as they are

There is not, Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

No, I'm just assuming a case where

2

you really didn't dispute the facts, but you still would

3

have no authority to give the money back?

4
5

MR. WALLACE:

Well, looking right now at the

provision which seems to preclude authority in the IRS --

QUESTION:

It only speaks in terms of claims.

7

It speaks in terms of claims.

situation in which there's no "claim" within the meaning

of the statute.

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

12

13

I'm assuming a fact

Well --

Just a discovery that we've got

$7,000 that obviously doesn't belong to us.
MR. WALLACE:

That, if we turn to the top of

14

page 4, that is subsection (C) of the same provision,

15

limited no claim filed, and that says that you still have

16

to meet the time limits of subsections (A) and (B).

very hard to see how the Service would feel authorized to

make a disbursement of Treasury funds --

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

It's

Mr. Wallace --- in this situation.

-- may I ask, if this was not a

22

problem that was noticed by the administration, at least

23

there was a press release at the very time that your cert

petition was filed.

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

1

In which I believe the President

2

announced that the law must be followed, but this is a

3

very hard situation for people to be in, that they

4

overpaid and they can't get it back, so wasn't it proposed

5

that there be a study of what legislative solution there

6

might be to help people out in this bind?

7

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

9

MR. WALLACE:

10

And that is under study --

Where?
-- just in the Treasury

Department.
QUESTION:

11

Well, would you recommend -- assuming

12

the facts are as the petitioner states, or as the

13

respondent states them in Brockamp, the case of the

14

elderly man, would you recommend that a private bill be

15

passed?
MR. WALLACE:

personally --

MR. WALLACE:

20

Well, I can't -- would I

up to that.

Would the Justice Department?
Well, I can't say that we've faced

QUESTION:

Because I've noticed you've had two

22

of these bills in 34 years --

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

25

There have been rather few.

on these.

MR. WALLACE:

1

There have been rather few, but

2

these are not instigated by us, after all.

They're

3

instigated by the taxpayers if they can get a

congressional sponsor.

5

QUESTION:

Well, I just wonder what --

6

QUESTION:

Well, surely the Justice Department

7

would recommend a private bill in this case, wouldn't it?

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well --

Well, can you speak for the

Department?
MR. WALLACE:

11

We don't know the facts.

We only

12

know what the administrator's affidavit, the daughter's

13

affidavit said 4 years after -- more than 4-1/2 years

14

after --

15

QUESTION:

Well, assume everything's correct --

16

MR. WALLACE:

-- after the events occurred

17

here.

It's -- there wasn't any contemporaneous finding

18

about whether this man had the capacity or not.

19

The receipt by the IRS was not an unusual one.

20

Oftentimes elderly taxpayers have capital gains or other

21

sudden increases in income, and there was no explanation

22

for it.

The check merely accompanied an extension of time

23

request.

Obviously, the family was in a better position

24

to be monitoring his financial affairs than the Internal

25

Revenue Service was, and could have looked into his bank

1

accounts if they thought at the time that there was lack

2

of capacity.

3

there was lack of capacity at a time when it's difficult

4

to prove it, and this kind of claim can be made in many

5

cases.

They're now saying, 4-1/2 years later, that

I might, as a matter of fact, since we're into

6

7

the facts, talk a little bit about the facts in the Scott

8

case, where there was actually a bench trial, and -QUESTION:

9

Mr. Wallace, may I ask before you do

10

if you can just clarify for me what would be within the

11

universe of possible responses beside a private bill?

12

suppose what the administration was looking for was not a

13

private bill, but something maybe akin to the mitigation

14

rules.
MR. WALLACE:

15

I

There could be something of that

16

sort.

17

the time periods upon a showing of certain kinds of

18

incapacity, but they could expand them for only a limited

19

time, because each year you expand it you're adding

20

another 200 million tax returns that possibly could be

21

reopened at a time when there's talk about downsizing the

22

Internal Revenue Service, and at a time when there are

23

budget constraints.

24
25

It could be temporally limited.

They could expand

And in order for legislation of this kind to be
adopted, Congress needs help in preparing a revenue impact

1

assessment of it, rather hard to do, since we don't know

2

easily how to estimate how many additional out of time

3

refund claims might be stimulated once there were a

4

provision that allowed consideration of the individual

5

circumstances of taxpayers.

6

The Service has estimated that it now turns down

7

about 250,000 refund claims a year in whole, without

8

examining whether the refund was warranted or not because

9

they're out of time, but most tax counsel who wouldn't

10

file an out-of-time refund claim today on behalf of a

11

client, might -- that figure might increase a great deal.

12

So another possible legislative response to this

13

would be simply to increase the limitations periods in the

14

hope that more situations such as the alleged situation of

15

Mr. McGill would be caught without having to examine the

16

individual circumstances of individual taxpayers, just to

17

give their guardians or relatives more time in which to

18

ferret out examples of this kind, which would be much less

19

administratively burden -- there are all kinds of

20

possibilities, but to date nothing has been proposed by

21

the administration to the Congress, nor am I -- we'll of

22

course inform the Court if any action is taken either on

23

the Hill or by the administration.

24
25

In the meantime, it must be recognized that the
press release that was issued was issued on the premise
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

that the existing law bars such claims, as we think these

2

caps on the refund do, and there's no point in saying that

3

the claim can be allowed for a longer period if you can't

4

get any payment as a result of filing the claim.

5

So read as a whole, the provision is

6

inconsistent with equitable tolling, as the Court

7

concluded the applicable provisions in the Lampf case

8

were, and I do want to emphasize that with respect to an

9

express cap on disbursements from the Treasury there is no

10

more fitting example of where the traditional rules about

11

waivers of sovereign immunity should be applied.

12

When Congress has explicitly capped the

13

disbursement that is authorized to be made, that cannot be

14

enlarged beyond what the language requires.

15

has said about waivers of sovereign immunity, a court is

16

not in a position to enlarge it on equitable grounds.

17

It's quite different from just a statute of limitations on

18

the filing of the claim itself.

19

QUESTION:

As the Court

As far as the equity is concerned, do

20

you need to go -- say anything more than the Court did in

21

its decision in the Dalm case?

22

23
24
25

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Dalm case really

addresses everything that's at issue here.
What was asked for in Dalm, an expansion of the
doctrine of equitable recoupment, was an equitable claim

1

very similar to a tolling claim, and some would refer to

2

it as a tolling claim.

3

It's a form of claim for avoidance of the

4

limitations period that isn't as precisely defined a

5

deferral of the limitations period as the ordinary tolling

6

claim, but it's very similar, and we think the Dalm

7

decision does have a controlling analysis here, and in

8

particular its holding that these provisions concerning

9

tax refund suits must be read in conformity with one

10

another and with all the cross-referencing that's involved

11

here.

12

Let me just talk very briefly about the facts of

13

the Scott case to show what kind of thing we're concerned

14

with here, and in Scott we proceeded all the way to a

15

bench trial with findings, and some of those findings

16

which are set forth on pages 44a and 45a of the appendix

17

to our petition are rather telling here.

18

20

QUESTION:

For one thing --

But the only case we have before us

is the Brockamp case, Mr. Wallace.
MR. WALLACE:

No, what -- we have both of them

21

together, Mr. Chief Justice.

They were decided as

22

companion cases and we petitioned in the two cases.

would be in the Scott case from our standpoint.

5

The companion case in Scott involved his 1984

6

tax liability.

What the Service knew was that he himself,

7

even though the claim now is incapacity because of

8

alcoholism, he himself had filed in January of 1985 his

9

estimated tax return and payment.

His father had done

10

that with his prior installments of estimated tax for

11

1984 .

12

And then through the bench trial proceedings we

13

were able to find out some facts which we -- which the

14

district court has listed on page 44a and 45a, that in

15

1984 Scott executed a partnership agreement to operate a

16

retail wine shop.

MR. WALLACE:

9

What was the expert testimony about?
It was about how alcoholism can be

incapacitating, but -- and there were two doctors, one for

10

the Government and one for the defense, but obviously the

11

Service would have to be very wary, the more a claim of

12

incapacity seems specific only to the capacity to comply

13

with the Internal Revenue laws and leaves the person able

14

to comply with many other laws.

15

The administrative finding of -- in such a case

would not be one where the Service could easily decide

that it was an appropriate occasion for tolling.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. KLUEGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Government would have us believe that where

11
12

a disabled taxpayer erroneously overpays his taxes and

13

later, through some miracle, determines that he has

14

overpaid and then seeks his redress, the Government would

15

have us believe that Congress intended that that disabled

16

taxpayer should have no redress, even in a case such as

17

this, the Brockamp case, where the erroneous overpayment

18

was a direct result of the taxpayer's disability.

19
20

QUESTION:

Well, he has redress for 3 years.

I

mean, there's just a time limit on it, right?

He has no redress because he was

disabled throughout the statutory period.

That is the

Only through some miracle his daughter

discovered the overpayment following the taxpayer's death,

Now, it doesn't seem to be that much of an

taxpayer's act, that the taxpayer's act not be the result

11

of his fantasies or his delusions, but be the act of a

12

rational, competent taxpayer, and if I might, to

13

illustrate this point, a -- because the counsel for the

14

Government has discussed the possibility of holding

15

hundreds of millions of tax returns open perhaps

16

indefinitely if equitable tolling applies.

17

6511(a), I submit, contemplates that.

18

This section

If we have someone who does not perform any of

19

these two predicate acts, let us assume he didn't in 1962,

20

and let 30 years go by without paying his tax and without

21

filing his return, and then one day he walks in and files

22

his return and pays the tax, and then a year later figures

23

that he overpaid and files a refund claim, that is a

24

perfectly timely refund claim under anyone's

25

interpretation of 6511.

MR. KLUEGER:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

No matter what it was, the payment

1

however, it is no less dense and integrated than title VII

2

of the Civil Rights Act, which was the grounds for

3

applying equitable tolling in the Irwin decision.

4

In the Irwin decision, we had a procedure for

5

recouping -- procedure for suing on a title VII case that

6

is really very similar to what we have where -- in the

7

statutory regime for refund claims.
We had a situation where an individual goes to

his particular agency under the Civil Rights Act.

If that

claim is denied, he goes to the EEOC, at which point there

11

is a 30-day letter that is sent to the individual.

that is denied, he has the opportunity to sue in Federal

(b)(2), it is as a function of the limitation in time.

3

There are plenty of substantive limitations that exist in

the Internal Revenue Code.

To the extent that amounts are limited in

This isn't one of them.

For example, the Internal Revenue Code says --

6

provides a limitation on the credit you can get against

7

the State taxes.

8

That is a substantive limitation that is contained in the

9

tax court -- in the tax code, and no court can change it

11

The code says, it's limited, $192,800.

to $193,000.
That's not what we have here.

To the extent

12

that it affects the limitation, it is a limitation that is

13

a function of time, and that time in (b)(2) refers back to

14

the time limitations in 6511(a).

15

QUESTION:

Fine, but how do you apply (b)(2)?

MR. KLUEGER:

distinguishable in that the issue of a taxpayer's

eliminate the amenability of the tax code to an equitable

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

In Irwin, the Court recognized that waivers of

14

sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed, and

15

then said that once Congress had made such a waiver we

16

think the rule of equitable tolling should be applicable

17

to suits against the Government in the same way as to

18

suits against private defendants, and that amounts to

19

little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver.

20

Those -- that rationale applies to tolling of

21

the limitations for filing suit, or for filing claims.

22

really is not addressed to the obstacle here, which is a

23

substantive limitation, a cap that Congress has imposed on

24

the amount of the refund that's authorized to be disbursed

25

from the Federal Treasury and, as I pointed out earlier,

It

1

therefore it would require a broadening of a waiver of

2

sovereign immunity beyond the express terms of the waiver

3

to rule that a court may override this cap in the very

4

sensitive area of disbursements from the Treasury, the

5

area that is most related to the constitutional

6

underpinnings of the doctrine of sovereign immunity

7

itself, including the provision we have pointed to in the

8

Constitution, in Article I, section 9, Clause 7, that no

9

money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence

10

of appropriations made by law.

11

Now, it is the fact that in Webb the Fourth

12

Circuit suggested some ways of reading the rebuttable

13

presumption in Irwin more narrowly, and we have done the

14

same thing in a pending petition and reply brief in a case

15

called United States v. Fagin involving the Quiet Title

16

Act, which we have suggested that the Court hold for the

17

decision in this case.

18

But -- and I think that these suggestions are

19

well worthy of consideration, and the Court in Webb at the

20

conclusion of its opinion pointed out some other areas

21

involving other Federal statutes where various courts have

22

held that the rebuttable presumption has been overcome

23

even if the presumption of Irwin does apply, but in this

24

particular case we're really beyond the area where it's
