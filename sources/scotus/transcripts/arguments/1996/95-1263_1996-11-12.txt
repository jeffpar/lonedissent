ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment of the

12

district court in this case, not because of any error in

3

the district court proceedings, and not because the

4

district court lacked jurisdiction to try this case, but

5

solely because the district -- the case was not within

6

Federal diversity jurisdiction at the time that the case

7

was removed from State court.

8
9

Because this ruling conflicts with prior
decisions of this Court and makes no sense from the

20

standpoint of judicial economy, we've asked the Court to

21

grant review.

22

23
24
25

Now, the facts that are necessary to understand
the legal issue are these.
The plaintiff, James Lewis, was injured while
operating a bulldozer manufactured by Caterpillar and

2

Kentucky State court against Caterpillar and Whayne Supply

3

alleging a number of tort claims.

4

He brought suit in

Liberty Mutual Insurance Group which had paid

5

Lewis worker's compensation benefits intervened as a

6

plaintiff to protect its subrogation rights and brought

7

virtually identical tort claims against Caterpillar and

8

Whayne Supply.

9

Now, at the time the complaint was filed, the

10

case was not removable to Federal court because both

11

plaintiff Lewis and defendant Whayne Supply were citizens

12

of Kentucky, so there wasn't complete diversity of

13

citizenship.

14

Several months later, however, Caterpillar's

15

counsel learned that Lewis had settled his claim with

16

Whayne Supply, the non-diverse defendant, and Caterpillar

17

thereupon removed the case to Federal court in Kentucky.

18

Lewis moved to remand the case, making the single argument

19

that the district court lacked subject matter

20

jurisdiction.

21

Lewis --

QUESTION:

He was right at that point, was he

22

not, because Whayne was still in the litigation.

23

MR. GELLER:

That was obviously a disputed

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

MR. GELLER:

If the error had not been cured, I

2

think there would be an argument that the issue should be

3

reserved for appeal.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but of course the claim is that

5

there was prejudice here because of different rules on

6

what evidence can come in and because of the non-unanimous

7

jury in Kentucky and so forth.

8

MR. GELLER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Yes.
Do you think any of those procedural

rules at the State level could ever amount to prejudice?
MR. GELLER:

Well, if the error had been

12

objected to and not cured, which is not our case, I think

13

there is an argument that the issue might be reserved to

14

be argued on appeal from a final judgment, and if the

15

error is consequential, could lead to a reversal.

16

not this case.

17
18

QUESTION:

That is

Well, but we take the case in the

posture that there was an error when it wasn't --

19

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

21

MR. GELLER:

Well, the error --- sent to State court.
The error, Justice O'Connor, was

22

simply in removing at a time when there wasn't diversity

jurisdiction.

24

QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:

Right.
It's just like this Court's case,

as I hope to discuss in a few minutes, of Finn where the

2

identical error occurred, and yet the Court said, as I'll

3

explain, that the rule is even though that error may have

4

occurred, if jurisdiction exists at the time of judgment

5

in the district court, that's not -- there's no ground to

reverse on appeal.

11

Whayne was dismissed, at the point at which you had

complete diversity, it would have been too late for you to

13

remove.

14

when there was not complete diversity, you never could

15

have gotten into the Federal court.

So, but for the removal, the wrongful removal

Yes, but there was no diversity then.
Well, I understand that.

There may

22

be a separate question, one the -- once the case is in

23

Federal court whether it should have been remanded for

24

lack of diversity, but there's no dispute that the 1-year

25

period was satisfied.

My point is imply that if you had

would have been too late for you to remove.

correct?

18

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

That is true.

Is that not

That is true.

One other point I was glad to hear

you say in your argument is that you were not relying on

QUESTION:

He had the

argument, if you're making that, because 1292(b) is an

exception to the very firm final judgment rule, and people

MR. GELLER:

Well, not -- it's not a question of

pursue.

the motion to remand, Justice Ginsburg, was that there

2

wasn't diversity jurisdiction.

3

Court's Finn case, which I hope to discuss in a minute.

4

And in Finn, this Court held -- and it has been the rule

5

for 50 years -- that even if there wasn't jurisdiction at

6

the time the case was removed from State to Federal court,

7

if jurisdiction subsequently attaches during the trial,

8

that's the end of the matter.

It's precisely like this

10

had been after 1 year, or suppose a hypothetical case,

It would be in the nature of filing a suit after the

if that objection had been preserved and if the error had

that perhaps would lead to a reversal on appeal.

Well -In your case the judgment is saved

only because something happens toward the end.
MR. GELLER:

10

In that case, though, there would

be a statutory error, and the question would be, is the

12

statutory error something that should lead to a reversal

only error that's complained -- that was complained of in

the motion to remand was the lack of diversity

I would think that your argument is

not that it's statutory versus non-statutory, but rather

that it's curable versus -- or rather, that its non-

MR. GELLER:

MR. GELLER:

1

Yes.

I guess our position would be

2

that these sorts of errors should be the subject of a

3

motion to remand in the district court, and that's where

4

the plaintiff's remedy is.

5

all cases, the district court will grant those motions if

6

they deserve to be granted.

7

the opportunity to seek an interlocutory appeal is not

8

taken, if the case then goes to judgment in Federal court

9

and it's a perfectly valid judgment in all other respects,

Presumably in 99 percent of

If they are not granted, if

10

I think there's a strong argument that that judgment

11

should not be reversed because of that error.
QUESTION:

12

13

So, what you're saying is that these

matters basically are to be left to the district courts.

14

MR. GELLER:

I think that these -- this may be a

15

category of error in which the plaintiff's remedy, even if

16

it's not cured, would be with the district judge and you

17

wouldn't want to reverse a Federal judgment based on them.

18

But I have to repeat again because it seems to

19

me so critical to this case that we're dealing here with

20

an error that -- not a statutory error and was completely

21

cured and seems to us to be on all fours with the Finn

22

case.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Geller, what wasn't

24

completely cured was that there was a removal at a time

25

when there was no statutory right to a removal.

1

What you're asking us, I think if I get you

2

right, is pretend that this case had been filed anew in

3

the Federal court before the trial.

4

Whayne was dropped out, there was complete diversity, and

5

I could understand an argument that says take the case at

that point.

11

MR. GELLER:

12

We're not relying, as I suggested earlier, on

suggest that, in answer to Justice Kennedy's question,

have resolved it prior to trial and he didn't pursue it.

18

This is one more way in which he could

QUESTION:

What you are assuming, it seems to

19

me, and might have said to Justice Ginsburg is that

20

although the statutory error in one sense exists forever,

21

the only real interest that is at stake here is an Article

22

III jurisdictional interest.

23

jurisdictional interest gets cured, then the statutory

24

error becomes de minimis, and given the interests in

25

economy and so on, it isn't worth reversing.

And if an Article III

2

though there was no diversity at the time that case had

originally gotten into Federal Court, and reinstated the

between a plaintiff who prevails in such a case, the

was resisting removal because the plaintiff doesn't

A defendant does.

MR. GELLER:

Right.
And when a defendant removes and the

Isn't that a difference in the situation of the plaintiff

there because the defendant dragged the plaintiff there?

Now, in this respect a very significant case I

think is this Court's decision in Newman-Green, which is

less than a decade old, a decision that the plaintiff

10

relegates to a footnote and says there's no relevance.

11

But it seems to me it's precisely on point in view of the

12

thought that Your Honor is expressing.

13

Newman-Green is a case in which the plaintiff

When the case got to the court of appeals, the

20

jurisdictional error was discovered, and what happened,

21

though, is not that the case was thrown out of Federal

22

court, but that the error was remedied on appeal.

23

this Court sanctioned that, saying the non-diverse

defendant could simply be dismissed from the case on

That was a case where the defendant didn't ask

to be in Federal court.

He was erroneously dragged into

MR. STAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

not exist at the time of removal and in fact did not exist

8

until 3 years after the 1-year time limitation for removal

under 1446(b) had expired.

10

QUESTION:

As far as that latter point goes,

11

when we granted certiorari in the case, we didn't know

12

that that was an issue, and I doubt whether we would have

13

granted certiorari to decide an issue that is so narrow;

that is to say, if you remove within the time period, but

15

that removal is invalid, can a later remedying of the

MR. STAYTON:

Well, no.

The court of appeals

13

ruled that there was no subject matter jurisdiction at the

Since there was no subject matter jurisdiction at the time

1

harmless error theory, but that is not applicable here.

2

First of all, Newman-Green does not deal with

3

removal.

4

First, the question of 28 U.S.C. 1653, as has been noted

5

today, provides that the court of appeals could amend

6

defective allegations of jurisdiction but not defects in

7

jurisdiction.

8

that they could dismiss a dispensable party under rule 21

9

rather than remanding to the district court for the

10
11

Newman-Green deals with two specific areas.

And, second, the court of appeals ruled

district court to do so.
So, in looking at Newman-Green, it would be my

12

position that Newman-Green does not have any bearing upon

13

the matter at bar as it has nothing to do with removal but

14

merely addresses the interpretation of a statute of

15

Congress and a rule of civil procedure.

16

In summary, with regard to this argument, I

17

would submit that the rule of this Court has been clear

18

that the statutes of Congress are to be strictly

19

interpreted, and I would ask this Court today to strictly

20

construe the statutes and ask that the judgment of the

21

Sixth Circuit be affirmed and this matter be remanded to

22

the State court.

Just two short things, Mr. Chief

Justice.
First, the suggestion has been made that

5

Caterpillar didn't make this argument until its rehearing

7

Apparently during the oral argument in the Sixth Circuit,

8

some question arose as to what would happen if the

jurisdictional error was cured, and Caterpillar on

That's simply not true.

10

September 28th, 1995, after the oral argument but before

11

the Sixth Circuit decided this case, sent up a postÂ­

12

argument letter which cited Grubbs, cited lower court

13

cases like Able v. Upjohn which cited Finn.

14

these cases were before the Sixth Circuit, in addition to

15

this argument being before the Sixth Circuit, prior to the

16

Sixth Circuit's decision in this case.

17

So, all of

Second, let me just say one last thing about

18

this 1-year provision in addition to the fact that it

19

wasn't violated here and in addition to the fact that this

20

argument has never been preserved.

21

year provision -- Congress put the 1-year limit in the

22

statute a few years ago in order to prevent the delays and

23

disruptions that occur when a case is rested out of one

24

court system and put in another court system after a lot

25

of work has been done on a case in the first court system.

The purpose of the 1-

1

That's why the 1-year provision is in there, to prevent

2

diversity removals after a case has progressed quite a

3

while in State court.

4

Yet, that's the precisely the evil that would

5

occur here if the plaintiff's argument prevailed because

6

it would mean that a case that has been essentially

7

completed in Federal court would have to start all over

8

again from scratch in State court and be retried there.

9

So, the plaintiff's argument -- not only is it

10

inconsistent with the language of the 1-year provision,

11

since the removal occurred here prior to a year, it's

12

plainly inconsistent with Congress' policy in putting the

13

1-year provision in the statute to acquire a case that's

14

gone to verdict in Federal court to be tried again from

15

scratch in State court, even though there was no error in

16

the Federal proceedings.

17

So, we would ask that the decision and the

18

judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and that the

19

plaintiff be allowed to raise whatever other arguments he

20

had on appeal in the Sixth Circuit.

Thank you.
