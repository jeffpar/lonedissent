ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The principal issue here is whether a reasonable

12

jurist in 1 88 would have believed the decision in Simmons

13

v. South Carolina compelled by the Court's prior decisions

14

in Gardner and Skipper.

15

I think the main things I want to emphasize are

16

first how closely analogous Skipper and Simmons are, how,

17

indeed, hard it would be to avoid going from the holding

18

of Skipper to the holding of Simmons and, on the other

1

hand how distant the issue in Simmons was from the issue

20

in California v. Ramos, which is the case principally

21

relied on by the Commonwealth, and how very difficult it

22

is to get from Ramos to a result opposite to the result

23

that was reached in Simmons.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, I'd like to ask you a hard

question at the outset.

If you are contending that we're

dealing with nothing new in the Simmons decision, what do

2

you say about the 4-1-4 split on this Court about whether

3

the Simmons rule was even required by the Constitution?
MR. SMITH:

4

The split on this Court as to

5

whether the Simmons rule was required by the Constitution,

I believe the Court was 7 to 2 on that issue, Your Honor,

it's my understanding.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

17

Yes.
With Justice O'Connor speaking for

three justices --

16

It was a -- there was a plurality

Yes.
-- joining in the same holding.
Well, I don't recall what the split

was, but in any event there was a split.
MR. SMITH:

There was a dissent, Your Honor.

I

18

think even the dissent, in my view, did not so much reject

19

the narrow rule of Simmons, the rule as narrowly stated by

20

the majority in Simmons, which is quite -- there wasn't a

21

majority, but the rule as narrowly stated by the plurality

22

in Simmons was quite specific.

23

When you have an allegation of future

24

dangerousness, and a defendant seeks to rebut that by

25

showing that he is ineligible -- ineligible for parole, he

has a due process right to do that.
I do not read the dissent as rejecting that

holding so much as the dissent in Simmons says, this case

4

does not present that narrow issue.
QUESTION:

case, was it?

Skipper was not really a due process

It was an Eighth Amendment case.

MR. SMITH:

7

Indeed --

I think it was both, Your Honor, but

8

I think it was much more clearly and easily a due process

9

than an Eighth Amendment case.
QUESTION:

10

opinion pretty well limited itself to Eighth Amendment.
MR. SMITH:

Eighth Amendment.

The text does limit itself to the

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the text of the

So you're relying on a footnote to

say that it's a due process case?
MR. SMITH:

6

Yes, because that is what the

7

footnote says, Mr Chief Justice.

many words -QUESTION:

9
20
21

The footnote says in so

It's a strange place to find

doctrine.
MR. SMITH:

Not always, Your Honor.

I think

22

here it's not strange because I think what happened is the

23

Court wrote a difficult and disputed Eighth Amendment

24

opinion and dropped a footnote to say, and by the way,

25

there's an easy due process route to the same result, with

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

They were not

In the petition itself -There was a 151-page habeas petition

which doesn't mention that footnote.
MR. SMITH:

10

In the -- we did not mention it in

11

the habeas petition itself.

We did on direct appeal in

12

1988, at a time before the petitioner's conviction became

13

final.

14

Skipper.

We did argue that this rule was compelled by

15

The -- I think the facts of Skipper were a

16

defendant who had -- was charged with being a future

17

danger, where the prosecution was trying to prove future

18

dangerousness, and the response he wanted to make was, I

19

have behaved well in prison up to now, and therefore I'm

20

not going to be so dangerous as you might otherwise think.

21

It was held that he had a -- unanimously that he had a due

22

proces right to do that.

23

The issue in Simmons seems to me almost a

24

fortiori -- when

know whether I'm going to be in prison or not, and it's

2

hard to imagine a much more relevant fact on the issue of

3

future dangerousness than whether the man is going to get

4

out or not.

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

He certainly can, and the

prosecution -QUESTION:

9
10

He can be dangerous in prison, I

assume, can't he?

7
8

The --

Murders in prison occur with some

frequency.
MR. SMITH:

11

The -- but he can be dangerous in

12

prison and the prosecution is free to make that argument,

13

but what the prosecution prefers to do, and preferred to

14

do here, is frighten the jury with the thought that he's

15

going to be next door to them tomorrow, that he'll be out

16

on the street, and they -- that's a much better way to get

17

a death penalty.

18

Of course the prosecution can argue life without

19

parole isn't going to do it because he's going to kill his

20

cell mate, and the defendant has to try to meet that

21

argument.

22

But when the prosecution says, as the prosecutor

23

did here, isn't it interesting that he can't be out on the

24

street for more than a little while without getting into

25

trouble, at that point it seems to me fundamental, obvious

that the defendant should be allowed to get up and say, by

This is it for me.

But there would be no way to

guarantee the jury that this man would not be back on the
street.

3

MR. SMITH:

That -- that's an argument, Justice

4

Scalia, but it does not make the life without parole

5

situation irrelevant.

6

is still almost overwhelmingly relevant.

7

you could always change the law.

argument that was excluded would be of such overpowering

MR. SMITH:

It does go to the force of the

argument.

still a very powerful argument despite the fact that the

25

possibility of changing the law does exist.

I respectfully submit, Justice Scalia that it's

1

It's still -- in a future dangerousness case, as

2

I believe one of the opinions in Simmons said, it's about

3

the best argument you've got, and often the only argument

4

you've got, that I'm going to be locked away for the rest

5

of my life.

6

the jury doesn't have to buy it, but the jury certainly

7

may buy it.

8

9

You don't have to worry about me, that may --

It's a very powerful argument.

QUESTION:

But in Ramos, and you're going to

have to get to Ramos sooner or later, we in effect said

10

the instruction to the jury about the Governor's power of

11

commutation of a death sentence was not a reguired

12

instruction.

13

think that's a fair reading of Ramos --

That's I think implicit in the holding.

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

I

I think it --- if not explicit, and that was what

16

the judges had before them as of the time this conviction

17

became final.

18

MR. SMITH:

I think it is explicit, Justice

19

Kennedy, but it's not in anything like the context that

20

we're talking about here.

21

The argument was made, I thought a -- I think a

22

rather weak argument, and the Court thought it a rather

23

weak argument in Ramos.

24
25

The argument was made that if you're going to
tell the jury that the life sentence is subject to

1

commutation -- that was the main issue in Ramos -- then

2

you must also tell them that the death sentence is subject

3

to commutation.
The Court's response was, and I'm reading from I

4
5

think 3458 of 103 Supreme Court.

6

this argument puzzling.

The Court was, we find

7

A jury -- I'm skipping a little.

A jury

8

concerned about preventing the defendant's potential

9

return to society will not be any less inclined to vote

10

for the death penalty upon learning even that a death

11

sentence may not assure the prisoner's removal from

12

society.
The argument that the petitioner made in

13
14

Ramos -- I'm sorry, the respondent in Ramos, that the

15

prisoner made in Ramos, and that the Court rejected, was

16

simply an illogical argument and was rejected as

17

illogical.

18

Beyond that, Justice Kennedy, Ramos didn't

19

present a right-of-rebuttal situation at all, and the

20

Court noted that.

21

was saying this man will be dangerous and the prisoner was

22

saying -- standing up and saying let me show the jury

23

something that makes me not so dangerous.

24

what was going on.

25

QUESTION:

Ramos was not a case where the State

That is not

What it did present was, I think, a

1

puzzling tactical decision that counsel has to make, but I

2

think you have that same tactical decision in every jury

3

case.

4

You have some cases where the prison -- where a

5

prison inmate is killed, and you don't want to emphasize

6

to the jury that he's going to be in prison the rest of

7

his life.
MR. SMITH:

8

9

We have -- well, we didn't have a

tactical decision in this case, Your Honor.

10

tried to make the decision.

11

our hands.

The decision was taken out of

We said -- my client said I want to tell the

12

13

Because we

jury I'm facing life without parole.

14

QUESTION:

But the point is, is that as of the

15

time this conviction became final you had Ramos, which

16

made it very clear that these choices are ones for States

17

to make.

18

MR. SMITH:

I do not think that Ramos says or

19

even suggests that this particular choice is open to the

20

States, Your Honor.

21

Ramos does say the -- what Ramos holds, of

22

course, is that it's okay for a State to tell the jury

23

that the life sentence is -- life without parole can be

24

commuted to a sentence of life with parole.

25

It says in dictum that the State could make
11

1

another choice.

It does not say or imply that the State

2

could make that choice in a context where it's forbidding

3

the defendant from rebutting.
Indeed, the choice that's referred to in Ramos I

4
5

think pretty clearly is a choice to be more favorable to

6

the defendant than California had chosen to be, a choice

7

to remain silent about the possibility of parole, and

8

those are the words -- the possibility of parole, not the

9

impossibility or the unlikelihood, the ineligibility of

10
11
12

parole.
A State, the Court said in Ramos, can choose to
give more protection than the Constitution requires by

3

remaining silent on that subject.

It did not say or imply

4

that the Court may silence the defendant on that subject,

5

may forbid him from bringing this truthful information to

6

the jury's attention even where it is the only information

17

that can rebut the charge of future dangerousness.

8

The -- I think it's -- Skipper is indeed

9

extremely close and Ramos extremely distant.

I guess I

20

would add that even if it were not so, even if I didn't

21

have a case as closely on point as Skipper, it would still

22

be true that the rule in Simmons should not be considered

23

a new rule, because I think that a relevant factor is not

24

only the closeness of the prior precedent, but the

25

egregiousness of the practice that is being condemned.

1

And I think the practice here, which really did

2

exist here -- it may not have existed in Simmons, as the

3

dissenting justices thought it did not.

4

thought it did -- but it clearly exists here, is the

5

practice of scaring the jury about a dangerous man being

6

back on the streets of their community without telling

7

them that there happens to be a State statute that forbids

8

under any circumstances putting him back on the streets of

9

that community.

10

The majority

To me it is almost as bad -- I will grant the

11

almost, but almost as bad as if a State had passed a law

12

saying in a criminal case we will no longer permit a

13

defendant to present the defense of alibi.

14

QUESTION:

But it doesn't go to whether the

15

defense is dangerous, whether he is a dangerous person,

16

and that's all that Skipper involved.

17

put in evidence in Skipper that he had not been dangerous

18

when he was incarcerated, that he had indeed engaged in

19

good behavior in prison, so the jury could conclude on the

20

basis of that he is not a dangerous person.

21

They allowed him to

What you're saying now is that it is obvious

22

from that that you can put in evidence, not that he's not

23

a dangerous person, but as -- but that although he is a

24

dangerous person, you don't have to worry about it because

25

he's going to be in jail.

Now, that's a step further.

1

I agree it may be a

2

good argument, and it's an argument you might want to

3

make, but it's a step further than what we had held up to

4

that time, which is, you can bring in evidence to show

5

that in fact he's not a dangerous person.
MR. SMITH:

6

Well, you're making the distinction,

7

Justice Scalia, between he's not dangerous by reason of

8

his character, and he's not dangerous by reason of his

9

circumstances.

10

I don't think there's much persuasive

force to that distinction.
It's true that Skipper is not the absolutely

11

12

identical case, and you don't have to have an identical

13

case.

14

QUESTION:

It's -- I think it's a long way --

15

sentencing determinations are usually made on the basis of

16

what the defendant did and what his character is, and

17

that's typically what a sentencing jury takes into

18

account, and Skipper was well within that.

19

You wanted to show the man's character is not so

20

bad.

21

a totally new argument.

22

that he behaved very well.

23

dangerous.

24

He'll be behind bars.

25

He behaved very well in jail.

Now you come in with

I don't want to tell the jury
He is a bad man.

He's very

However, you don't have to worry about him.

Now, that may well be -- we held that that is an

1

argument you should be able to get before the jury, but

2

it's a quite different argument from the argument that

3

this is not a dangerous man.

4

MR. SMITH:

I don't think it's correct, Justice

5

Scalia, to say that before Simmons the sentencing

6

determination was limited to character.

7

for -- going back to the time when in Jurek and other

8

cases these statutes were upheld, the jury was assigned a

9

predictive function as well as a function of judging the

10

I think that

defendant's character.
QUESTION:

11

Predictive of his behavior, not of

12

the circumstances of the world.

13

14

only give him 10 years instead of 20.

15

to get that evidence in on the basis of Skipper?

16

think so.

17

MR. SMITH:

Not of whether he's going

Should he be able
I don't

Or what -- if he's terminally ill?

18

I think -- yes, I would be startled if he didn't have a

19

due process right to tell the jury that if I'm

20

terminally --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, may I ask, because your

22

time is running short, whether you are putting your main

23

emphasis on, not a new rule under Teague, or whether you

24

think you have a good case under the Teague second

25

exception, and if you think that you do, I would like to

know what it is.
MR. SMITH:

Okay.

I am certainly putting my

3

main emphasis on its not being a new rule, but I think if

4

it were new,

5

second exception.

6

make, because I have to make what I think is the false

7

assumption that there's something new about the idea of

8

giving this due process right to the prisoner.

9

I would have a good case under the Teague

That is,

I have -- it's a difficult argument to

I have to assume a world which I don't

10

think ever existed in which it was generally accepted that

11

you could charge a man with being dangerous in the future

12

and forbid him from informing the jury that he's going to

13

be unparolable for the rest of his life.

14

for me it's hard to imagine that world.

15
16

QUESTION:

Well,

It's hard to --

let's make the assumption that

this Court rules against you --

17

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SMITH:

Yes.
-- on your Teague argument.
If I make that assumption,

then I

20

say that the whole point,

21

exception is to deal with really egregious,

22

practices that create a high risk of a wrong

23

determination, a high risk of finding someone dangerous

24

who is in fact harmless.

25

I think, of the second Teague
shocking

That's why there is a second Teague exception.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, it goes to both the two

theories on which you proceed.

7

the fact that the State had to establish future

8

dangerousness, or are you also relying on the specific

9

arguments made by the prosecutor in this record?

10

MR. SMITH:

Are you just relying on

I'm relying on both in the sense,

11

Justice Stevens, this is a fortiori from Simmons.

That

12

is, even if Simmons had never been decided, I think I

3

could stand here and say a decision here is compelled by

4

Skipper, and without going to the intervening stages.

QUESTION:

You think Skipper rather than Gardner

is the more relevant authority?

Gardner is at a higher level of

20

account the level of generality, so if I had only Gardner,

21

it would not be as clear a case as I think it is.

22

But even if it were only Gardner, I would make

23

the argument I started to make a minute ago about, suppose

QUESTION:

3

Mr. Smith, for purposes of the Teague

exception does it matter whether it's a death case or a

MR. SMITH:

I think Teague, as I understand

8

same way.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, and there are exceptions.

There

are the two exceptions.

MR. SMITH:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
Here we're dealing with the second,

13

and my question to you is, is there any basis for taking a

14

different approach to that second exception when it's a

15

death case rather than a case where the defendant is

sentenced to a term of years?

17

MR. SMITH:

Well, I'm not -- I may be missing

18

the point of your question, but I think obviously there's

19

a difference in that in the -- where there's not a death

case the issue is usually guilt or innocence, and the

21

cases describing the second exception tend to talk in

22

terms of the conviction of the innocent.

really arguing the contrary -- that the execution of

2

which is a basis for execution of a man who does not, in

3

fact, present a danger would be analogous to the

4

conviction of an innocent person, but I'm not sure I've

5

answered your question.

6

QUESTION:

There may be something else.

Mr. Smith, could I ask you to come

7

back to Ramos?

8

relevance of Ramos to this question.

9

It seems to me you understate the

What Ramos held is that the defendant did not

10

have the right to have the jury instructed that,

11

regardless of whether you impose the death penalty or life

12

imprisonment the penalty can be reduced or commuted.

13

Now, doesn't that go to the same issue that is

14

involved here, namely whether the sentence you impose will

15

eliminate the dangerousness of this individual?

16

MR. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

I think the answer is -The defendant wanted to tell the

18

jury, look, you're not going to eliminate this man's

19

dangerousness by imposing the death penalty, because that

20

can be eliminated by the Governor.

21

MR. SMITH:

First, the literal answer to your

22

question I suppose is yes, it went to the possibility of

23

eliminating the person from the community.

24
25

The distinction is that, as the Court pointed
out in Ramos as a basis for its holding on that issue in

Ramos, is that the instruction that the defendant was

2

asking for was logically irrelevant to the decision the

3

jury had to make, or if, indeed, it wasn't harmful.

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's not all it said.

The

5

Court said in Ramos that we -- it has deferred to the

6

State's choice of substantive factors relevant to the

7

penalty determination.

8

MR. SMITH:

I don't think, Justice -- sorry.

9

QUESTION:

And at that point cites a Georgia

10

statute identical to the South Carolina statute later

11

invalidated in Simmons.

12

MR. SMITH:

Is that no evidence that such a

Actually, I don't -- I don't think

14

it was a South Carolina statute invalidated in Simmons,

15

but I -- I think it was a practice that they found the

16

Supreme Court to have sanctioned.

17

But the -- I also don't think that the language

18

you're quoting was in the context -- I may be wrong, but I

19

don't think it's in the context of the holding that Ramos

20

was not entitled to the instruction on the Governor's

21

power to commute the death penalty.

22

I think the context of that was, we're saying

23

its okay for the States to tell the jury about the

sentence, and P.S., it's also okay not to tell them and to

MR. SMITH:

I think not.

8

QUESTION:

I will check it.

9

QUESTION:

But in Ramos and in Simmons so far as

10

the State's position in Simmons the Court was very

11

concerned with the fact that these aren't simple matters

12

of historical fact, because the law can change.
If the defendant is subject to life without

13

possibility of parole, that can change, and the

15

prosecution can argue that in rebuttal, and that's why

Simmons was new.

notice that the legislature might change the rules on

3

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Certainly.
And this was of great concern to the

complex.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

I'm not -Counsel for the defense says now he's

not going to be paroled, then on rebuttal the prosecution

says this has been changed many times, and corrections

policy is subject to the whim of the legislature.

12
13

MR. SMITH:

I must say,

I don't detect that

great concern in Simmons, Justice Kennedy.

14

The argument of course can be made that parole

15

is so inherently confusing that it should never go to the

16

jury, but it's tough to make that argument when you have a

17

statute that says life without parole, period,

statute some day.

and the

That's a complexity not beyond a jury's ability

something the Court really had to struggle with in

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I want to begin by setting the record straight

7
8

on something that O'Dell has argued this morning, and

9

which this case is not about.
O'Dell is apparently relying not only on a lack

10
11

of a Simmons instruction, but he apparently today now says

12

he's also relying on some argument that the prosecutor

13

made some improper argument, and that that is a separate

14

type of rebuttal issue, and there was never, and there has

15

never been a claim in this case of improper prosecutorial

argument.

18

think you're referring to counsel's response to my

question.

20

I didn't take -- in fact, I thought he was very

21

diplomatic in not suggesting that there was any sort of

22

ethical impropriety, but what was left, I think his point

was, was a misleading impression.

there's ever been a claim in this case that the prosecutor

misrepresented the law to this jury, and in fact --

QUESTION:

But isn't it clear that the

impression that a jury would take from the argument was

10

the impression that, under the law as it existed, this

11

individual could be paroled and placed out on the street

12

again so that he could commit the kind of depredations

13

that he prosecutor quite accurately was referring to as

14

his past acts, and that in fact was not so, was it?

15

MS. BALDWIN:

He was not allowed -- correct, he

16

was not allowed a Simmons instruction, but if this

17

prosecutor had in any way directed this jury that O'Dell

18

was going to get out on parole, that would have been an

issue that would have been reversed immediately and

automatically by the supreme court.

QUESTION:

What I was going to say -- my

question was going to be, isn't it the case that what he

wants to rebut was an implication about the law which in

law he could be paroled for this offense?

QUESTION:

MS. BALDWIN:

The only point that I wanted to

make on this particular -- it seems to be a secondary

5

argument that has been made, is that it doesn't in any way

fit this case.
O'Dell was the one who mentioned the word parole

7
8

before this jury to begin with.

The issue never came up

9

until in his cross-examination of Donna Doyle in the

10

sentencing proceeding he cross-examined her about the

11

Florida -- the failure of the Florida parole system, so

12

there's none of this Skipper-type of rebuttal.
In other words, in Skipper, the prosecutor was

14

arguing, this individual is going to be dangerous in jail.

15

In fact, he's going to rape other prisoners.

If that's the case,

if the jury

understood its equally dangerous in prison or out,

I kind

of wonder why the prosecutor objected to the instruction.
MS. BALDWIN:

11

Well, he objected to it because

12

under Virginia law it was absolutely not allowed that

13

juries receive information about parole whether it

benefited the prosecution or the defendant,

because they said it's an act of self-defense, and from

that the court was willing to infer that that was the

thrust of the argument.

4

inference is permissible from this prosecutor's argument.

MS. BALDWIN:

But you don't think that kind of

I do not believe it is.

I believe

he was doing nothing but arguing history.
QUESTION:

If it were, would you agree, then,

8

that clearly Simmons would not have been a new rule?

If

9

the prosecutor had in effect misrepresented to the jury

10

that this man will get out of jail unless you sentence him

11

to death, that -- and the court then refused to give the

12

instruction, I think you would agree that that would have

been impermissible.
MS. BALDWIN:

Well, no.

That would have been a

prosecutor misleading the jury on a matter of State law,

affirmatively misleading --

MS. BALDWIN:

As a matter of fact.

to correct that, and that would have been reversed.

20

That's why no Virginia prosecutor would have ever made

such an argument, because they knew that their cases would

have been reversed if they had told juries improper

information, anything to do with this man's future parole.

2

happen on parole, particularly because the law changes

3

constantly --

4

MS. BALDWIN:

5

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

-- and they wanted the jury to focus

6

precisely on what the sentence -- sentencing options

7

before them were.

8

9

MS. BALDWIN:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy,

and I think very important here and significant is,

10

actually is a 1952 case from Virginia, Jones v.

11

Commonwealth, and this is a case which the Ramos supreme

12

court, the California supreme court had relied on.

13

And in Jones v. Commonwealth the rationale for

14

the States, and which they believed was the majority

15

rule -- was the majority of States believe this, and that

16

was that even if the defendant was ineligible for parole,

17

because that's what happened in Jones v. Commonwealth and

18

he wanted an instruction, the Virginia supreme court said,

19

well now, if we have to instruct him on that, to have a

20

completely accurate instruction we would also have to tell

21

them that really doesn't guarantee he won't be released,

22

because the Governor could commute it.

the Briggs instruction.

24
25

In other words,

And Virginia supreme court said, we're not going
down that road.

We are not going to allow that, because

1

that would be so prejudicial.
And in 1988, the most significant factor that

2

3

shows that the Virginia supreme court's decision was a

4

reasonable interpretation of existing law is the fact that

5

no other case anywhere had held that Virginia's practice

6

was unconstitutional.

7

And I believe, Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed

8

out, that the Simmons case itself was not unanimous, and I

9

think that is compelling, if not dispositive evidence of

10

the fact that it was a new rule because it obviously was

11

susceptible to debate among reasonable jurists.
But in 1988, under Ramos, it was very clear from

12

13

Ramos that the decision of whether States should even --

14

should, could, or should not instruct juries about any

15

matters that come after the verdict about commutation,

16

pardon, and parole --

QUESTION:

18

MS. BALDWIN:

19

At it's simplest --- which is clearly within the

discretion of the States.
QUESTION:

20

At its simplest level, I was taking

21

their argument, or a possible argument to be the

22

following.

23

At its simplest level you have a rule growing

24

out of preceding cases that where the jury is under an

25

important potential, false apprehension about the
36

1

difference between life and death, that under those

2

circumstances the defendant has a right to clarify

3

matters.
And on that very simple, basic way of looking at

4
5

it, you would see Gardner, Skipper, and Simmons, each is

6

involving a fairly simple misapprehension that was

7

important and later clarified, while Ramos, you would see

8

as involving a possible misapprehension, but one that was

9

very unlikely to affect the jury.

10

Not impossible, but

unlikely.
Now, under -- that's the theory, or a theory I

11
12

think that would say, Simmons is simply an application of

13

a preceding existing general principle, and Ramos is the

14

same thing, though the facts of it lead to the opposite

15

conclusion, so I'd appreciate comments on that.
MS. BALDWIN:

16

I would disagree with that for two

17

reasons.

18

Simmons said.

19

defining for juries, or giving them definite instructions

20

about a sentencing option.

21

First of all, I don't think that that's what
I don't believe that Simmons is a rule of

Simmons is a case about rebuttal of future

22

dangerousness, a due process right of rebuttal of future

23

dangerousness, and nothing else.

24

to do with an instruction being inaccurate.

25

that is not the rule of Simmons.

It doesn't have anything

It's not --

And secondly, in 1988, I think the equally

1

2

important case to Ramos that was out there was Caldwell,

3

and I think Caldwell clearly told States that if you want

4

to correct jurors' possible misapprehensions about

5

appellate procedures, or we can infer from that anything

6

that comes after the jury verdict, then you may do that,

7

State, if you want to, but -- and the controlling

8

concurring opinion in Caldwell said specifically that's a

9

matter of -- that's a policy choice to be made for a

10

State.
So I'm a court in 1988.

11

I think a reasonable

12

interpretation of the law governing this issue that O'Dell

13

is bringing before me is not only Ramos, but it's also

14

Caldwell, that says these matters are policy choice.
And in fact I think that it was the prudent

15
16

course in 1988 for a court to decide not to instruct their

17

juries about -- or take on that task of trying to disabuse

18

them of misperceptions that they may have about appellate

19

commutation, pardon, and parole procedures, because it's

20

in my view in 1988, as a reasonable jurist, that's too

21

speculative.
It's getting too far away from the matter at

22

23

hand, and that is, what is the appropriate sentence for

24

this individual, and I think there was complete support

25

for that.

1

The Virginia supreme court relied on Ramos, the

2

Fourth Circuit relied on Ramos, the Fifth Circuit relied

3

on Ramos, and this Court's decision in Simmons was not

4

even unanimous, so I don't see how there can be a

5

legitimate argument made that this was not a new rule.

6

I wanted to address briefly the question about

7

this being a watershed, fulfilling the second exception to

8

Teague or not, and I think that this Court's cases on the

9

second exception have made absolutely clear that the rule

10

11

has to do something more than just improve accuracy.
It has to do something more than that.

It has

12

to literally alter our understanding of the bedrock

procedural elements covering criminal cases.

difficult question, because I think that if you are

1

to come up with a rule that will ever meet the second

2

Teague exception.

3

And there's a reason for that, and that's

4

because the entire purpose of the new rule doctrine is to

5

validate and uphold judgments and a finality of judgments

6

that were reasonable when they were made, and so it should

7

not be an exception, and this Court in Gecky v. Branch

8

specifically said, if -- just because a practice is

9

claimed to have been shocking, which I submit it

10

definitely is not, but that's O'Dell's argument, that does

11

not mean that it qualifies as a Gideon-type new --

12

exception to the new rule doctrine.

13

QUESTION:

What do we do about a situation in

14

which the rule is new in the sense that there's no other

15

decision on the books, but in fact the decision is in

response to a problem which no one would ever have

conceived would have arrived?

18

In other words, in effect it's such an egregious

case that it was never -- there was never any need to

litigate it before, so in once sense it's a new rule

21

because there wasn't any prior decision, and in another

would ever have thought that it would be necessary to

MS. BALDWIN:

2

I don't think so, unless it met

this standard of this primacy and centrality.

think it can be something that is a particular practice in

one case.
QUESTION:

6

I don't

Oh, I quite agree, but assuming it

7

reaches the point of fundamental importance that we're

8

talking about, would it satisfy the second Teague

exception to be this unusual kind of new rule, which is

10

new only in the sense that it's so fundamental that no one

11

ever had to litigate it before?

12

MS. BALDWIN:

Well, I don't think that alone

would satisfy the second exception.

to say that this is like Gideon.

No one would ever reasonably have disputed it.

What's new is that in this odd case it had to be litigated

Now, assuming that we're dealing with a matter

the egregious case that never had to be litigated before

but has now been litigated and represents what most people

would have supposed the law always had been, would that

kind of a case satisfy the second Teague exception?
MS. BALDWIN:

10

Justice Souter, I don't think I'm

going to agree that -- I cannot possibly conceive of a

rule, frankly, that would meet the second exception, so I

would say even under those circumstances not.

Would you say, then, that it was no

there was no prior case law on it, it simply represented

Because all Simmons is -- all

Simmons was, was essentially an exception that was carved

out of the Ramos general rule of deference to States to

It seems a rather

May I ask a factual question, Ms.

You mentioned that the -- apparently the jury

was apprised of the fact that this man had committed a

7

murder while he was in prison before.

8

reference to that in the prosecutor's closing argument,

The only thing that the prosecutor

And then O'Dell in his case, when he came in, he

1

2

went into great detail explaining to the jury about this

3

murder that had occurred in prison, because it was the

4

killing of another inmate, and he had an explanation that

5

he gave to the jury.
QUESTION:

6

But am I correct in reading the

7

prosecutor's argument, the prosecutor did not refer to

8

that incident at all in his closing.
MS. BALDWIN:

9

He referred to the murder, on page

10

61 of the appendix.

He did not refer to -- he did not

11

describe it as a murder that occurred in prison.

12

He says, there is a graduation of seriousness of

13

the offenses from use of a car, to a robbery, to a murder,

14

to an abduction, and another robbery, and now to another

15

murder, so he listed it.
QUESTION:

But that's what he then followed with

talking about, isn't it interesting that he's only able to

be outside of --

-- the prison system for a matter of

months and a year-and-a-half before something has happened

precedent that exists at the time they're making their

decision they can be assured that those judgments will

remain valid, and I think that that is irrespective of the

sentence in the case, and I don't think there's -- there

6

definitely should not be an exception, because it would --

I think it would destroy the new rule doctrine.

QUESTION:

Of course, the theory of the

exception is that the error was so serious the judgment

was not valid when it was made.

11

that if there's a sufficiently serious constitutional

error, the whole thing is void.

That's the whole theory,

That was the old-fashioned notion in habeas

QUESTION:

4
5

Yes.

-- previously in a sense, so how is

the line drawn?
What they're saying here is, it's so obvious

6

that juries think that life doesn't mean life.

The

7

average person in the street thinks that, life doesn't

8

mean life, that it doesn't take much before they think in

9

the jury box, life doesn't mean life, and therefore tell

10

them, life means life, otherwise they'll sentence the

11

person to death under that misapprehension.

12

MS. BALDWIN:

13

QUESTION:

Well --

Now, that's what I think he's saying

14

is so serious, because there's such a basic principle in

15

the law, that certainly you're not going to sentence

16

people to death when the jury's under a serious

17

misapprehension that somebody is trying to cure.

18

And all the details of all these cases, which

19

you're absolutely right, they're all over the place in

20

terms of complexity, that's really beside the point when

21

you see that very basic thing that they're trying to

22

illustrate.

MS. BALDWIN:

But I think that that's what

24

Simmons said in 1994.

25

1994, and that's a perfectly reasonable position.

That's what this Court has said in

1

To use Simmons as the prism through which we

2

look back at other cases is what the new rule doctrine

3

says we can't do.

4

is that what courts thought in 1988.

You've got to go back in time and say,

5

And I submit a perfectly reasonable, I think

6

rationale for the rule in 1988 was that courts for one

7

thing did not consider rebuttal, I think, in the way that

8

Simmons described rebuttal.
I mean, they -- I think as Justice Scalia

9
10

pointed out, it was reasonable for a court to believe that

11

you were not rebutting future dangerousness by showing

12

that you were going to be parole-ineligible, because by

13

doing that you were showing that you had a horrendous

14

record, so terrible that the State was not going to let

15

you out on parole.

16

not thought that was rebuttal.

17

A reasonable court I think would have

I mean, and in addition, all of the arguments

18

that this -- if we go down that road it's going to be so

19

speculative it's going to end up prejudicing the

20

defendant, because if you want to give a complete picture

21

you're going to have to come in and show that the Governor

22

could let him out, he could escape from prison, any number

23

of things that would deflect the jury, I believe.

24
25

Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll
conclude.

Mr. Smith, you have 5 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. SMITH

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to

6

address briefly the idea that the death sentence here was

7

the result of the fear that he would be dangerous in

8

prison, which has been an argument made both in the

9

harmless error context and also in the context of

10

suggesting that it was reasonable to -- a reasonable

11

jurist in 1988 might have taken that approach.

12

I think the -- that what happened here is very

13

closely analogous to what happened in Skipper.

14

saying that improper arguments were made.

15

arguments were made, but the arguments had nothing to do,

16

or at least did not advertise themselves to have anything

17

to do with the man's dangerousness in prison.

18

I'm not

Very fair

The prosecutor had what you might think is this

19

absolutely wonderful fact that a prison murder had

20

occurred, and did not even mention in his closing argument

21

that that murder was in prison.

22

middle of a -- what he called an ascending hierarchy, and

23

chose to stress the more serious things that had happened

24

afterwards.

25

Indeed, he put it in the

He talks about a night stalker.

He talks about

the man at large on dark and rainy nights, and then he

2

uses the language that I think Justice Souter read.

3

it interesting that he is only able to be outside of the

4

prison system for a matter of months to a year-and-a-half

5

before something has happened again.

6

But what is interesting about it?

Isn't

What's

7

interesting about it, of course, is that it generates in

8

the jury the thought that this might recur.

improper argument.

It's not an

It's a perfectly fair argument as long

10

as the defendant is allowed to rebut it, but it cries

11

aloud for rebuttal.

12

QUESTION:

It might recur.

I mean, all the

13

defendant can say is, well, as the current law is, he

14

wouldn't get out.

15

say, well, the current law may be changed?

16

was changed only 2 years ago.

about how State laws are changed.

Should the State be able to come in and

that's not how we ultimately concluded, but I don't know

21

that you couldn't have looked at it that way at that time

22

and just said, we don't want to get into all these things.

23

MR. SMITH:

I guess I just -- I respectfully

24

submit, Justice Scalia, that what is obviously happening

is that you have someone whom the prosecution is

portraying successfully as a terrifying individual, that

2

for him to be able to say, I'm facing life without parole

3

is such an obvious thing.

4

prevent him from doing that.
QUESTION:

5

It is so obviously unfair to

Now, did the defendant so testify in

6

front of the jury and tell the jury that he wouldn't be

7

eligible for release?

8

MR. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

That didn't occur.

That was a

misstatement by counsel?
MR. SMITH:

11
12

No, Your Honor.

I don't think that's what Ms.

Baldwin said.
He never said that he would be ineligible for

13
14

parole.

15

he called a flat 16 years because I've got a parole

16

violation, and therefore he drew the inference something

17

like, I ain't never gonna get out.

18

He said, I'm 45 years old.

I've got to do, what

That to me is not nearly comparable, does not

19

render harmless at all the Simmons error to say that,

20

assuming the jury understood and believed what he was

21

saying, which is a big assumption, that's a long way from

22

saying I'm facing life without parole.

23

He tried to say it.

He proffered that testimony

24

and it was objected to. He asked for an instruction, and

25

by the way an instruction has nothing -- even though it's

1

an instruction as a matter of fact, an instruction is

2

simply a way that you judicially notice facts brought to

3

the attention of the jury.

4

He wanted to put this fact, the fact that he was

5

facing life without parole, before the jury.

6

put it in in rebuttal of an argument that was made and

7

made very effectively that he was a dangerous person who

8

could not be in the community for more than a few months

9

without causing trouble.
He was not permitted to do that.

10

He wanted to

That was an

11

obvious violation of due process.

It would have been a

12

clear violation of due process to a reasonable jurist in

13

1988 .

14

If there are no other questions, I'll conclude.
