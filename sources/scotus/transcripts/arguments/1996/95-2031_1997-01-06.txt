CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 95-2031, Thomas Young v. Kirk Fordice.
Ms. Wright.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA WRIGHT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10

MS. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises because the State of

11

Mississippi, since early 1995, has been conducting voter

12

registration under procedures that have not been submitted

13

for preclearance to the United States Attorney General or

14

to the D.C. District Court, as required by section 5 of

15

the Voting Rights Act.

16

Because the section 5 preclearance requirement

17

is so critical in protecting the right to vote in States

18

such as Mississippi, Congress expressly provided in the

19

National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the NVRA, that

20

States must comply with the Voting Rights Act in

21

implementing the NVRA.

22

Now, the procedures that Mississippi ultimately

23

decided upon in implementing the NVRA established a two-

24

tier or dual system under which citizens who register

25

under the provisions of the NVRA must also register

2

plan that implements the NVRA through that type of dual

3

system reflects a change from the voter registration

4

system that Mississippi had in effect prior to 1

5

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask you a question right

6

here about that?

Suppose from the outset Mississippi had

7

said we're not going to change our State and local

8

registration system from what it's been.

We're going to

keep it, but here are the changes we're offering to
10
11

implement for Federal election purposes the NVRA.
Could the Department of Justice refuse to

12

preclear such a scheme if Mississippi kept in place its

13

State local registration scheme and had a proposal that

14

met the statutory requirements for the NVRA?

15

MS. WRIGHT:

Yes, it could Your Honor.

If the

16

procedures that the State adopted were found by the

17

Attorney General or the D.C. District Court to be

18

discriminatory in purpose or effect, that objection could

1

be made, and - -

20

QUESTION:

Well, even in the face of the fact

21

that the NVRA requirements expressly state that they

22

govern only Federal elections?

MS. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, in this case -There seems to be some indication in

the statute itself that it never - - Congress never

It doesn't require that, that is

It leaves that decision up to the States, but -QUESTION:

But you think that the Attorney

General can make that a condition of any approval?
MS. WRIGHT:

Well, it depends in part upon the

State's specific history and the practices it had.
QUESTION:

In any section 5 State you think the

Attorney General can insist on that?
MS. WRIGHT:

Mississippi had a unitary system by

statute at the time the NVRA came into effect.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. WRIGHT:

Yes.
And we contend that the

15

implementation of a dual system reflects a change from

16

that unitary system.

17

QUESTION:

It still does have the same unitary

18

system in place.

You can still register for both Federal

19

and State elections the same way you could before the NVRA

20

provisions went in.

MS. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

But you have a
Now you have an additional option.

and Federal, it is exactly the same as it was before,

2

isn't it?

MS. WRIGHT:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well, our contention is this.
Except for the false start.

Let's

leave the false start out of the mix for the moment.
MS. WRIGHT:

Leaving the false start out of it,

7

you now have a system under which there is a class of

8

citizens that once registered is not permitted to vote in

9

State and local elections, and that is not a unitary

10
11

system under any meaningful sense of the term.
QUESTION:

By reason of the special grace

12

provided by the Federal statute, but the same system that

13

existed for multiple registration prior to the NVRA is

14

still in place in Mississippi.

15

MS. WRIGHT:

There was no system of multiple

16

registration, though, because one registration made you

17

eligible for all purposes.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. WRIGHT:

Eligible -- well -And the real purpose of our lawsuit

20

here is to say that whatever choices Mississippi made in

21

implementing the NVRA, whatever plan it decided to adopt

22

ultimately had to be submitted for preclearance so that

23

the Attorney General could review exactly how that

24

procedure was going to be implemented, and there are many,

25

many discretionary choices that a State makes in deciding

1

Could you give me a few illustrations

I take it that's one?

MS. WRIGHT:

That's right, and also, for

example, the registration forms themselves.

10

NVRA forms that are currently in effect and are being

11

handed out at the State agencies do not say anything about

12

limited registration.

13

You have forms, for example, that are being

14

handed out at the public assistance agencies that are

15

entitled, Mississippi Voter Registration Application, and

16

nothing on the form tells you that when you fill that out

17

you're only going to be eligible to vote in State and

18

local elections, so it was vital for the Attorney

19

General - -

risk of people believing that they may already be

2

registered for all purposes when in fact they are not that

3

the Attorney General reviewed these procedures, each and

4

every one of them.

5

QUESTION:

Well, I can understand that, but to

6

ask the further question whether the Attorney General,

7

assuming the forms make it clear that it's only for

8

registration for Federal elections as the law indeed says

9

is necessary, whether it can go beyond that and say,

10

moreover, State, you have to make this a unitary system

11

now and follow the Federal plan for all, even State and

12

local.
MS. WRIGHT:

13

But if there were evidence before

14

the D.C. District Court or the Attorney General that a

15

dual system had been reinstated for the very purpose of

16

discriminating against minority citizens, certainly -QUESTION:

17
18

Not reinstated, kept, unchanged from

the past, but following the new law for Federal elections.
MS. WRIGHT:

19

But Your Honor, the cases such as

20

City of Lockhart v. United States recognize that even when

21

a State maintains certain procedures but changes other

22

aspects of its registration system, the procedures that

23

are unchanged themselves may be subject to section 5

24

review.

It just seems so counterintuitive in

MS. WRIGHT:

That's the troublesome part

QUESTION:

That wasn't in connection with the

9

Federal Voter Registration Act.

10

MS. WRIGHT:

No, it was not, but it was a

11

situation where one provision that called for numbered

12

post remained unchanged, and the Court held that it

13

nevertheless was a change when the city applied that

14

numbered post requirement to an election system where

15

additional seats had been added, because the Court held

16

that you have to examine a change in the context of the

17

entire election system.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Wright, why --

19

QUESTION:

That's fair enough when it's

20

voluntary on the part of the State.

21

made voluntarily on the part of the State you can say

22

well, the whole thing gets sucked in, but this is a unique

situation in which a certain change is imposed upon the

State by the Federal Government.

you implement that mandatory change must be cleared with

2

the Attorney General.

3

something else to say that because the Federal Government

4

has mandated this change all of your current system which

5

you have not changed at all has to be resubmitted for

6

clearance to the Attorney General.

7

MS. WRIGHT:

That's one thing.

But it's quite

But Your Honor, the Attorney

8

General is entitled to examine the effect that this

9

particular method of implementation will have on voting

10
11

and registration in State and local elections.
QUESTION:

Whatever its effect is is the fault

12

of the Federal Government, so long as the procedures for

13

implementing the Federal scheme themselves are fair.

14

MS. WRIGHT:

15

QUESTION:

Well -Now, it may discourage people from

16

voting in State elections who find it easier to register

17

for Federal only, but that's the Congress' fault for

18

applying this new system only to Federal elections.

19

MS. WRIGHT:

We argue, Your Honor, that because

20

of the decision in Allen v. State Board of Elections it's

21

clear that even if a change, a particular change is

22

mandated by the Voting Rights Act itself, it is subject to

23

preclearance requirements.

Your argument goes considerably

further than Allen, which itself went to me to the extreme

May I ask, Ms. Wright, I just want to

be sure, I didn't think the questions that Justice

O'Connor put to you is presented by this case.

concerned with whether or not the Attorney General would

have had a duty to preclear if there had been a

7

submission, are we?
MS. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

We don't -- for all we know the

Attorney General would just routinely preclear it.

MS. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

That question will arise when

and if the procedures - -

No.

We aren't

Well -Or perhaps she'd act wrongfully if

she refused to, but that's not before us, is it?

15

MS. WRIGHT:

The question of actual

16

discriminatory intent or effect is not before this Court

17

and it was not before the court below, and that is why we

18

contend that the Court exceeded its jurisdiction.

19

QUESTION:

Is it not true that even if it's

20

perfectly clear that the Attorney General would have had a

21

duty to preclear the existing system, you would

22

nevertheless prevail?

to submit all the changes that weren't made?

2

what you were asking for is that what has to be submitted,

3

the manner in which they carried out the changes required

4

by the voter registration, the motor voter act, and that

5

would be judged against a background in which they didn't

6

change the State officials.

7

But I don't understand -- I agree, I don't

8

understand why they'd have to submit the things they

9

didn't change. I suppose they'd have to submit the things

10

they did change, and then you would argue that those

11

changes are unlawful because of what they didn't --

12

i

I thought

MS. WRIGHT:

That's right.

We contend that the

13

procedures establishing a dual system, all of them, need

14

to be submitted for preclearance.

15

QUESTION:

But isn't all of that premature?

I

16

thought the simple point is, there's been a change.

change has to be precleared, period.

don't know that at this point.

Now, the Attorney

That's for the Attorney General

But it might be important to other

members of this Court to know just how far the Attorney

General's position goes.

It certainly is important to me.

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor's question?

13

MS. WRIGHT:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And in that respect, may I rephrase

Yes.
It isn't your position that as a

15

practical matter - - as a practical matter, the State must

16

ask for preclearance of its former voting procedures.
MS. WRIGHT:

17

It need not submit those

18

procedures, but we do believe that if the State is going

19

to change from its current statutory policy of a unitary

20

system it does need to obtain preclearance for that

21

alteration of its important policy, and that would be part

22

of

matter the State cannot leave in place its previous

alteration of those procedures.

MS. WRIGHT:

3

only because its current system contemplates a unitary

4

system of registration, and I do want to emphasize the

5

very narrow character of the inquiry that we have here.

6

The only inquiry is whether there has been a change and

7

whether, if there has been a change, that change has been

submitted to the Attorney General.

That's right.

Was that change brought about by the

MS. WRIGHT:

Yes.

It was an implementation of

the Voting Rights Act.

Virginia was implementing the

22

Voting Rights Act by providing assistance to illiterate

voters, and the Allen case held that the changes providing

16

Well, you pick on that and you say

that that has been changed.

17

Well, I mean, yes you can say that that's been

changed.

You could also say, however, if they had changed

19

it to a unitary, or had continued a unitary, you could

20

also say there has been a change because it used to be

that you had to, in order to register for the State, do

things beyond what the motor vehicle registration act

}

MS. WRIGHT:

I don't know why --

What we argue, Your Honor, is that

4

the State has been highly selective in deciding which

5

provisions of existing Mississippi law it must continue to

6

comply with and which it cannot change.

7

the important State policy of a unitary registration

8

system is clearly far greater in importance to the State

9

than the provision of an attesting witness requirement in

that Mississippi has identified as a bar to implementing

QUESTION:

I don't agree --- on a unitary basis.
If you ask me what would constitute

16

the least change that Mississippi could make in order to

comply with the Federal law, I would say it is precisely

what Mississippi did here, leave its current registration

19

procedures entirely in place.

20

If you want to register for State and Federal

localities at the same time, you just follow what

Mississippi has had in place for years, and add to that

what the Federal Government has required to be added:

MS. WRIGHT:

We would argue from the perspective

of the voters it certainly is not the least change
possible, because if you think about election day the
registrars are now required to keep two sets of poll
books, one for NVRA registrants only allowed to vote in
Federal elections, and one for other registrants.
Presumably if you go into the voting booth you
have to get a separate ballot, because if there are both
Federal and State elections on the ballot you can't be
permitted to vote that ballot, and so these types of
changes, these types of -QUESTION:

No problem.

QUESTION:
MS. WRIGHT:

But Your Honor -Just the way it was before.
But because the NVRA does require

that the States administer these procedures, the State, we
contend, has an obligation to identify exactly how it
wants to go about implementing the NVRA and obtain
preclearance for all of those decisions specifically
spelled out in a proceeding either before the Attorney
General of the United States or the D.C. District Court,
and that is what has not happened here.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

with respect to subsidiary decisions regarding the forms

MR. SANDERS:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's what the

2

plaintiffs refer to as the context argument, that the

3

context of the submission was different than the context

4

of the implementation of that which was submitted.

5

There is a very important thing to keep in mind.

6

Section 5 has -- prescribes a 60-day period for reviewing

7

submissions.

8

says that if the Attorney General within that 60-day

9

period decides not to object within that 60-day period,

Section 5 also, by the express language,

10

but that the Attorney General receives additional

11

information within that 60-day period, the Attorney

12

General may lodge a conditional objection pending an

13

opportunity to review that additional material.

Now, the 60-day period began here on

That's right.

And what you submitted does not

8

That's true, isn't it?

9

MR. SANDERS:

Yes.

To the extent that the

of statutory law, you're correct.

To the extent that there is

I'm not certain, however, that the very limited

8

things that we do when we designate which agencies fit the

9

description of public assistance agencies, I'm not sure

10

that that is enough Mississippi input to require those

11

things to be submitted for preclearance, but to the extent

12

that that is enough, they were submitted and they were

13

precleared.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sanders, wouldn't the most

15

important thing to preclear, perhaps the only thing once

16

Mississippi decides it's going to do a different Federal-

17

only registration, is to tell people who come into the

18

motor vehicle bureau in big letters, this will register

19

you for Federal elections only, and such a thing was never

20

precleared because the first submission didn't suppose

21

there was going to be that system.

22

MR. SANDERS:

Well, of course, the National

23

Voter Registration Act doesn't require that we set forth

24

any such disclaimer or warning.

25

we put certain forms at certain locations, and that's what

It simply requires that

7

Now, perhaps assistance to applicants

MR. SANDERS:

All right.

Yes, Your Honor, I

8

don't quarrel with that.

The fact is, we are informing

9

people when they come in to register of the status that

10

they will obtain by virtue of that registration, and I

11

don't think the fact that we now inform people, I don't

12

think the conveyance of information is a change within

13

section 5 that requires preclearance.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but the means by which you do

submitted to the Attorney General and has never been

18

MR. SANDERS:

construction of the forms?
MR. SANDERS:

2

If the State of Mississippi had

3

decided to put a lot of additional material on the form,

4

then we would have been constructing in a material sense.

5

If we had -- I can't think of an example, but if we had

6

put a great deal more material on there.

7

put on there were those things that would disqualify

8

someone.

9

All we actually-

The NVRA form has a voter declaration section

10

and all the person needs to do is sign his name below this

11

declaration which says, I have not been convicted of these

12

certain crimes, I am over 18 -- in other words, it

13

incorporates Mississippi's qualifications.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SANDERS:

Okay.
Now -- so Mississippi put

16

Mississippi's qualifications in there.

I suppose Alabama

17

put Alabama's qualifications in there.

So to that extent

18

it is somewhat different than the base form, from the

19

FEC --

20

QUESTION:

So you agree that insofar as you

21

include those, in effect State law conditions and

22

limitations you must submit the form for preclearance.

23

MR. SANDERS:

I'm just -- no.

I say that

24

arguably if - - I don't know whether just filling out that

25

part and putting our State qualifications is enough.

1

Frankly, I don't think it is.

2

could be, but I think clearly if we went further than

3

that, if we put other material in there, the more we put

4

into it
QUESTION:

5

I'm just saying arguably it

Or if you omitted material.

For

6

example, if you omitted a statement calling attention to

7

the fact that under Mississippi law this registration

8

would be good for Federal elections only, that omission,

9

as I understand it, would not be something that would

10

require submission for preclearance.
MR. SANDERS:

11
12

Well, I'm not sure that not

putting something in there amounts to a section 5 change.

13

QUESTION:

Well, you say you're not sure.

I

14

thought your position was going to be that you were sure

15

and it was not a section 5 change and you didn't have to

16

submit it.

17

MR. SANDERS:

Well, all right.

18

the affirmative.

19

section 5 change, correct.

I'll state it in

I don't think that not putting that is a

QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

What should we do if we think, well,

22

you haven't submitted the -- I see about 20 pages here in

23

this statute.

24

requirements, and maybe some are absolutely mandatory,

25

maybe some give you discretion.

It has a lot of different procedural

If we send it back and say you have to preclear

1

2

those, would there be a lot of argument about what you

3

have to preclear or not?

4

we do?

5

I mean, what would you suggest

I imagine what would happen is you'd have to

6

preclear those, and they'd come in and argue that in light

7

of the dual system you have to do something that's

8

virtually impossible.

9

argue, but they're going to argue that that dual system is

10

11

I don't know what they're going to

highly relevant, and you'll argue it isn't.
All right, and -- so what in your opinion, if

12

we - - just what Justice O'Connor asked, I think.

What is

13

your opinion if we disagree with you that it has been

14

cleared, and we think it hasn't been cleared yet, what

15

should we do?

16

MR. SANDERS:

17

you should just simply remand it.

18

this Court should in any way render a decision on - -

19

without going back to the district court, but I think

20

still, to the extent that anyone considers that a change

21

has been made, I think that it's still something that

22

section 5, the district court should have an opportunity

23

to look at.

24
25

Well, I think at most of course
I do not think that

11

MR. SANDERS:

12

QUESTION:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

Mr. Sanders, I'm reluctant, as some

3

others seem to be to say that you have to submit forms for

4

preclearance, because if we adopt that principle we'll

5

have to use it not just in this case but in all cases in

6

the future, and the notion that all forms are submittable

7

whenever you make any change is a rather expansive one.

8
9

On the other hand, I'm also concerned that the
Justice Department ought to be able to protect Mississippi

voters from being misled when they register under what is

21

a Federal-only system into believing that they're

1

forms to be submitted, how can the Attorney General

2

prevent the State of Mississippi from misleading citizens

3

that way?

4

MR. SANDERS:

Well, obviously through a

5

section 2 challenge or any Fifteenth Amendment-based

6

challenge, but our position is that the Attorney General

7

should not be able to do that through the device of

8

section 5 preclearance.

9

Again, we do not think that the Attorney General

10

should be able to review, object, or veto any mandate to

11

the State of Mississippi from the Congress, but they have

12

plenty of other options available to it.

13

as my good friend Mr. Stewart said, that base

14

implementation of the NVRA might amount to a

15

discriminatory purpose, if it does, then the United States

16

may challenge that in a variety of other ways but not

17

through the device of preclearance.

18

QUESTION:

To the extent,

Is there any significance to the fact

19

that the motor vehicle statute has a specific section in

20

it saying that this doesn't limit the application of the

21

Voting Rights Act and doesn't modify it in any way, and

22

doesn't it follow that if you adopt a new form to be used

23

to register voters, that that's a change or practice,

24

blah, blah, blah, within the meaning of section 5?

25

MR. SANDERS:

I read that language in the NVRA

1

simply to mean the same - - or I read it the same way I

2

read footnote 29 in Allen, where this Court says that

3

State-initiated changes, even when made to comply with

4

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, must be submitted for

5

preclearance.
I read that language in the NVRA the same way.

6

7

When the State makes changes itself, they must be

8

submitted for preclearance even though they are part of an

9

NVRA - QUESTION:

10

But the fact that the Federal

11

Government, the Federal statute required them to do some

12

things, made them print a new form with respect to

13

elections, is it not still true that the distribution of a

14

new form to people who are being registered, a form you

15

never used before, is a change in a voting practice?
MR. SANDERS:

16
17

Not within the meaning of

section 5.

18

QUESTION:

You don't think so.

19

MR. SANDERS:

No.

I don't think that language

20

in the NVRA was designed to give the Attorney General the

21

right of veto over an act of Congress, over a mandate from

22

the Congress.

QUESTION:

Well, if the -- without reference to

24

the NVRA, the State of Mississippi decided to have a new

form advising voters of the effect of their registration,

where they could register and so forth, would that have to

be precleared?

3

MR. SANDERS:

4

QUESTION:

If it was just a --

It's an instruction mailed to all

5

voters with respect to an explanation of registration

procedures.

7

You do not have to preclear that?

MR. SANDERS:

Absolutely not.

11

Suppose it's a new form, new wording,

et cetera.
MR. SANDERS:

It doesn't matter, Your Honor.

it's just designed to convey information to the

electorate, no, that's not a change in any sense.
QUESTION:

7

If

This is not a voting practice or

MR. SANDERS:

No, of course not.

It has nothing

to do with a person's ability to vote.

we're trying to inform them of their status, that does not

represent a change for section 5 purposes or for any other

purposes so far as I can see.
