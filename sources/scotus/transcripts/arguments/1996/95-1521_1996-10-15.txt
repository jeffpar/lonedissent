ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case involves a challenge to undertakings

13

by the United States in connection with a comprehensive

14

plan of action, an international agreement entered into by

15

50 countries in 1989 to address the migrant crisis in

16

Southeast Asia in the 1980's.

17

By 1989, 750,000 migrants from Vietnam alone had

18

fled to other countries.

19

back the migrants at sea, which resulted in a loss of

20

life, and Hong Kong revoked its prior policy of treating

21

the arrived migrants as presumptive refugees, and began to

22

treat them instead as illegal aliens.

23

Some countries began to turn

The comprehensive plan of action, or CPA, was

24

designed to diffuse this crisis, to protect those migrants

25

who genuinely feared persecution, to save the loss of

life, or to prevent the loss of life, and also to control

2

further illegal immigration.

3

Under the CPA, Vietnamese and Laotians were

4

permitted to land in Hong Kong and other countries, and to

5

seek refugee status there.

6

found to be refugees under international standards and

7

under the auspices of the UNHCR were permitted to remain

8

temporarily and seek resettlement in third countries, but

9

a central tenet of the CPA was those that were screened

Those who were screened in or

10

and found not to be refugees would be repatriated to their

11

countries of origin.

12

was hoped, or if need be, eventually involuntarily.

13

QUESTION:

That would be either voluntarily, it

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you to

14

clarify at the outset what the Government's position is

15

with respect to the statement by the respondents that the

16

respondents requested the State Department to seek from

17

the Hong Kong Government an extension of the undertaking

18

to process these people to cover the proceedings on

19

remand, and that the Department refused, so that a remand

20

would force the Hong Kong Government's undertaking to

21

lapse and would likely subject respondents to immediate

22

forcible repatriation.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm afraid

24

there must have been some confusion.

that.

2

discussions approaching the Government of Hong Kong about

3

this .

4

And I'm informed that last week there were

Those discussions again were taken up over the

5

weekend, and just this morning we received from Hong Kong

6

a letter in which Hong Kong -- and I just received it.

7

I've given it to opposing counsel, but we did not have

8

time to transmit it to the Court this morning.

9

In that letter, Hong Kong confirms a request

10

made by the United States that the 24 Vietnamese migrants

11

who are listed in an attached memorandum who are the

12

plaintiffs in this case, and those of Lisa Le, basically

13

the migrants for whom we previously had requested and

14

obtained assurances, would not be repatriated before

15

January 1997, January 31, 1997 or the completion of this

16

case, whichever comes first.

17

QUESTION:

I took that to be what you

18

represented to this Court in your motion to join -- in

19

your response to the motion to join additional parties,

20

because there you said that the Government obtained

21

insurances from the Hong Kong Government that both the

22

Lisa Le plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in this case would

23

not be forcibly repatriated during appellate and Supreme

24

Court proceedings.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

So am I correct in saying the

appellate proceedings would encompass whatever happens in

the Lisa Le case in the D.C. Circuit?

On remand through January 31.

The --

6

QUESTION:

And this case on remand.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

And this case on remand.

The

8

Government of Hong Kong is understandably getting somewhat

9

impatient and also, with the reversion of Hong Kong to

10

China on June 30, the Government of Hong Kong is eager to

11

have the return of the migrants completed and especially,

12

given the recent enactment of section 633 of the Illegal

13

Immigration Reform Act, which removes the statutory basis

14

for the claim, the circumstances of this case have

15

substantially changed, but yes --

16

QUESTION:

But your view is -- your

17

representation is that it's January 30 or the termination

18

of proceedings here and in the D.C. Circuit, whichever is

19

earlier?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

QUESTION:

22

The January 30 date or the

termination of proceedings?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

25

That'S correct.

That's correct.

That has been asked for, or that has

been received?

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

And if we were to vacate and remand,

10

would you have objection to the D.C. Court entering a stay

11

based on those terms?
MR. KNEEDLER:

12

A stay in this case, a stay is

13

not necessary because no injunction was ever entered in

this case.

MR. KNEEDLER:

The situation would be, pursuant

to these representations, Hong Kong would not

entered a stay, is that correct?
MR. KNEEDLER:

2

In the Lisa Le case it did,

3

because the district court in the Lisa Le case had entered

4

injunctions based on the panel's ruling in this case.

5

district court in that case entered a series of

6

injunctions which -- the D.C. Circuit for a month declined

a stay.

8

that stay application was ripe for consideration the D.C.

The

We filed a stay application here, and then when

10

representations we previously had obtained from Hong Kong

11

were perhaps instrumental in that stay.

QUESTION:

A stay of what?

a stay of Hong Kong's deportation --

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

17

It certainly wasn't

No, a stay --

I think our writ doesn't run that far

yet, does it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

No.

It was a stay of the

18

injunctions requiring -- preventing the State Department

19

from declining to process the visa applications of Hong

20

Kong, and basically the stay plus Hong Kong's assurances

21

maintains the status quo.

Of course, the -- that representation does not

prevent anyone from voluntarily repatriating.

1

into facts, may I ask you about the Government's position

2

on one other factual issue which I'm not sure of?

3

The respondents, as I recall, made the

4

representation -- this goes to the merits of their

5

claim -- that with respect to refugees who had been

6

screened out who were in Hong Kong from other countries

7

than Vietnam, the United States continues to, or has, I

8

guess, never refused to process immigrant visa

9

applications, and that it is only those from Vietnam who

10

have been the subject of this policy pursuant to this

11

agreement.
And I -- that interests me because it seems to

12

13

be a response to the Government's position that in fact

14

the reason for the Government's action is not the

15

nationality of the plaintiffs but the illegality of their

16

status, and the respondents are saying there are plenty of

17

others with equally illegal status, but if they are from a

18

different country they are being treated differently.

19

that -- is the respondent's claim factually correct, as

20

you understand it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

21

Is

Well, the -- let me explain it

22

this way.

The basis for the Government's policy is that

23

persons who are screened out under the CPA must return to

24

their country of origin rather than applying in the

25

country of first asylum.

QUESTION:

1

2

Does the CPA cover anything other

than Vietnamese refugees?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

It also covers Laotians.

Laotians.
But in Hong Kong it's true the

6

vast majority, in fact virtually all of the migrants

7

subject to the CPA in Hong Kong are from Vietnam, but

8

the -- this was -- this is a situation in which, in fact,

9

there are no other aliens similarly situated to those

10

covered by the CPA.
The CPA was a unique but perhaps precedent-

11
12

setting international agreement to address migrant crisis

13

of a sort of that the world is unfortunately very familiar

14

with over the last 3 or 4 years.

15
16

QUESTION:

You're saying the class, save for

Vietnamese and Laotians, is an empty class.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, yes, because the CPA was

18

entered into to address a migrant crisis that was itself

19

country-specific, and it -QUESTION:

20

Right, but I think if I understand

21

your answer, it is there are no refugees from other

22

countries than Vietnam and Laos in Hong Kong who have been

23

screened out and who are applying for immigrant visa

24

status.

25

There are no such individuals, is that correct?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Under the CPA, that's correct.

I frankly cannot represent

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

The CPA doesn't apply, and you

wouldn't be following that with respect to --

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

-- nationals from any countries -That's correct.

The predicate

17

for the application of this policy is the CPA in which the

18

United States and other countries undertook as a way of --

19

let me be clear about this.

20

agreement that has a number of parts to it, and the

21

central part was, in order to get the countries of first

22

asylum to allow people to land in the first place, they

23

had to have some assurance of a screening opportunity and

24

those found to be refugees would be resettled.

25

The CPA is a comprehensive

But an important corollary is, those found not

1

to be refugees would be returned, and that -- but the

2

people found not to be refugees includes those who happen

3

to have current visa petitions filed on behalf of them in

4

the United States and others, and the United States, in

5

consultation with UNHCR and other countries of first

6

asylum, concluded that it was essential to carrying out

7

the CPA to maintain that with respect to those migrants

8

who were covered by the CPA.

9

Again, this was a problem migrant crisis-

10

specific agreement, country-specific agreement, and in the

11

conduct of foreign relations and addressing migrant

12

crises.

13
14

QUESTION:

So the

CPA arose as a result out of

massive migration of Vietnamese and Laotians --

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

-- and not anybody else?
That's correct, and it was that

18

problem the CPA addressed, and we think it would be odd

19

indeed if the United States in its conduct of foreign

20

relations, where it can treat different nations

21

differently for legitimate foreign policy concerns, could

22

not also treat the nationals of those different nations

23

differently depending on the circumstances that have

24

arisen in the bilateral or unilateral -- I mean,

25

multilateral arrangements, and also just in the real world

1

taking account of what has caused the outflow of migrants.

2

Most migrant crises are country-specific, resulting from

3

the internal conditions of a particular country.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, in the proceedings

5

below, as I understand the record, the Government argued

6

that there was discrimination against Vietnamese nationals

7

but it could be justified on a rational basis, and as I

8

understand the argument made by the Government now is,

9

there was no discrimination at all.

10

And on a secondary point, I think the record

11

discloses that in the courts below the Government did not

12

argue that the language of the statute referring to

13

issuance of a visa did not include accepting a visa

14

application.

15
16
17

Were either of these arguments raised by the
Government below?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in -- going to the second

18

one first for the moment, the -- we did argue that -- I

19

think the argument that respondents make is that we did

20

not argue that the question of consular venue is

21

separately addressed and exclusively addressed by 8 U.S.C.

22

1202(a), which says that a person shall apply for a visa

23

in such locations as the Secretary shall prescribe by

24

regulation.

25

But we certainly did argue that this was -- that
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

1152(a)(1), which bars preference or priority or

2

discrimination in the issuance of visas, did not apply to

3

consular venue, and the argument that consular venue is

4

separately addressed by 1202(a) is just a further argument

5

in support of our basic claim that the -- that 1152(a)(1)

6

did not apply to this at all.

7

And in fact what we did argue in the court of

8

appeals is that the regulation that the Secretary issued,

9

which changed on appeal and the court of appeals applied

10

the amended regulation on appeal, that that was issued

11

pursuant, as we point out in our brief, to the very

12

specific authority in 1202(a), which is the consular venue

13

statutory provision.

14

So we think all these arguments were presented.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

How about the discrimination point?
In the lower court we argued that

17

this was -- that this was not discrimination* at least

18

that's my understanding, and also that -- but beyond that

19

the position here that this -- that -- I don't know if one

20

calls it justification, or it's not discrimination, that

21

you can look at it either way, that discrimination is a

22

conclusion that encompasses whatever justifications may be

23

offered for the policy, or that it's not discrimination in

24

the first place.

25

If the question just focused on whether there

1

were distinctions, then the statute would use

2

distinctions, but it uses the word discrimination, which I

3

think we would view as being a conclusion, and read into

4

that should be, particularly on something like consular

5

venue, the ability of the United States to take into

6

account nationality considerations.

7

As we point out in our brief, when Congress

8

enacted this provision in 1965, it had long been the

9

policy of the United States before then and since then,

10

for example, to adopt special procedures for security

11

purposes for aliens from particular nations, from

12

communist bloc countries for a while, and as the --

13

there's a declaration cited at page 17 of our -- of the

14

petition that describes that history and describes what

15

was before Congress in 1965.

16

I think that goes to both -- to actually two

17

points, that 1152(a) (1), the nondiscrimination provision,

18

didn't apply to the applications for visas in the first

19

place, but even if it did, Congress couldn't have not --

20

could not have meant to absolutely prohibit the --

21

irrespective of the justification the taking into account

22

of nationality in the processing, in the procedures for

23

the filing, the venue, and the review of visa

24

applications, that the nondiscrimination provision was

25

really intended from the outset to apply only to the

allocation of visas.
QUESTION:

2

Let me ask you one more question.

3

The Government now urges us to vacate and remand because

4

of the very recent amendment to section 1152 (a) (1) .

5

that recent amendment cover all of the respondent's

6

claims?

Didn't they make constitution --

arguments. First of all,

At page 21 of respondent's brief in footnote 13

17

they cite a letter that was sent to the -- by 45 Members

18

of Congress to the President in early August urging the

19

President to drop his support for the provision of the

20

bill that was ultimately enacted in 6 -- as 633 that was

21

then in conference, 45 Members of Congress, and they said

22

apparently those provisions were included in the House and

23

Senate bills at the behest of the State Department in

24

order to overturn the adverse result of the LAVAS

25

decision,

so it's entirely clear that the Members of

Congress when considering this provision, when it finally-

2

emerged from conference, knew that it was proposed for the

3

purpose of and would have the effect of overturning the

decision.

11

No, that's correct, and we think

12

it's clear, quite aside from this legislative history

making clear that this was intended to apply to this very

situation, the usual principles governing prospective

relief would make clear that it's effective prospectively.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Do you know what that's all

Well, not entirely, because it

21

would seem to us that any injunctive relief in this case

22

would direct the Secretary of State to provide for the

23

issuance of visas in Hong Kong in the future, and that's

24

the very reason why prospective relief cannot be granted

conference and House reports on this legislation say that

2

it was just intended to clarify the fact that the

3

Secretary of State has unreviewable authority to establish

4

visa venue rules, so it's clear that Congress was

5

ratifying the Secretary's interpretation of the statute

6

and intended to maintain the status quo.

7

In fact, the text of 633 says that nothing in

this paragraph -- meaning 1152(a)(1) -- shall be construed

9

to prohibit the Secretary from establishing procedures for

the filing of applications.

asked to do.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Excuse me.

QUESTION:

Whether that

Currently you have a panel in this

case and an en banc court in Lisa Le.
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Right, that is correct.

Now,

11

there is -- we recognize the confusion, and there is

12

something to be said, we acknowledge, for this Court going

13

ahead and deciding the case now that it's been briefed and

14

argued and presented to it.

15

this case all along, however, was based on this Court's

16

usual course when there's been an intervening change in

17

the law and also when other issues are in the case that

18

haven't been addressed.

Our suggestion of a remand in

I would like briefly to address those two other

20

issues, getting back to Justice O'Connor's question on

them.

22

The first of the other two claims is one that

the policy is arbitrary and capricious, in violation of

24

the Administrative Procedure Act.

with that.

There are two problems

The first is that judicial review of that

1

claim is precluded, as was judicial review of the

2

statutory claim, and that is itself true for two reasons.

3

One, the comprehensive judicial review

4

provisions of the INA establish that review is precluded

5

under the INA, or, excuse me, under the APA, and also visa

6

matters, including consular venue matters, are of the sort

7

traditionally committed to agency discretion, and

8

therefore barred -- judicial review is barred for that

9

reason as well.

10

With respect to the preclusion of review, I

11

would just like to point out that the INA contains

12

provisions for judicial review of deportation orders of

13

people who've entered the United States, and also for

14

judicial review of people who are seeking to enter the

15

United States, but in the latter category, only when

16

somebody has arrived at our shores and is in exclusion

17

proceedings and can seek review in habeas corpus, but not

18

because exclusion matters are generally appropriate for

19

judicial review, but because the person is in custody, and

20

therefore has access to habeas corpus.

21

In this Court's decision in Brownell v. Tom We

22

Shung in 1956, the Court held that an alien in the United

23

States could have access to the APA to seek judicial

24

review in an exclusion matter, but the Court pointed out

25

it was not suggesting, of course, that an alien who had

1

never reached our shores would be able to do that, and it

2

also cited legislative history of the '52 act in which an

3

exclusive review provision was deleted in which the

4

which Congress made clear that it was not providing for

5

review of consular officer decisions, or changing review

6

under the INA.

7

-- in

Then in 1961, Congress came along and

8

specifically overturned the Brownell decision, and

9

provided for judicial review in exclusion only -- in

10

exclusion matters only in habeas corpus, and not

11

otherwise, intending to remove the APA, the very basis on

12

which respondents seek to bring a challenge in this case.

13

And in fact the Court -- we spell this out at

14

pages 25 to 28 of our brief, and in fact the House report

15

on that legislation says that permitting an APA suit would

16

"give recognition to a fallacious doctrine that an alien

17

has a right to enter this country which he may litigate in

18

the courts of the United States against the U.S.

19

Government as a defendant."

20

Well, if that was true with respect to aliens

21

who had reached our shores, then a fortiori would be true

22

with respect to aliens who are in Hong Kong who have no

23

rights under the United States Constitution with respect

24

to their admission and no statutory rights that they can

25

invoke in court.

But even if this Court were somehow to get

1

2

around the preclusion of judicial review, we think the

3

respondent's APA claim would fail on the merits.

4

certainly not an arbitrary and capricious policy.

5

explanation is spelled out at pages 217 to 219 of the

6

Joint Appendix in this case, in which the cable that went

7

to the field in October of 1994 explains that this policy

8

was reinstated after a careful review, after concerns were

9

received from UNHCR and other first -- and first asylum

This is
The

10

countries that screening or processing immigrant visas in

11

Hong Kong and other first asylum countries was

12

discouraging people from returning voluntarily and

13

therefore was seriously undermining the comprehensive plan

14

of action.

15

The State Department also pointed out that since

16

1990, when it had adopted the opposite view, it believed

17

that conditions in Vietnam had improved, and therefore it

18

was appropriate to insist that people return there before

19

filing for visas to come to the U.S.

Mr. Kneedler, are you aware of any

surely has the power to do it, and we don't deny that, and

frankly we believe the other two claims can be very

readily disposed of, and so we -- that's one of the

4

reasons why on remand we would expect the court of appeals

5

to readily dispose of the claims.

6

The court of appeals itself, for example,

7

applied the change in the regulation on appeal, even

8

though the respondents were invoking claims under the

9

prior regulation, on the theory that no one has a vested

10

right in receiving a visa, and if there's a change in the

11

law, that should be applied.

12

We would expect the court to do that.

In fact,

we would expect Congress understood, knowing the LAVAS

decision, that that would be the rule and it's change in

the law would be applied.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL WOLF

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WOLF:

6

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There are two issues that must be resolved in
favor of affirmance in order to -- in favor of respondents

10
11

in order to affirm this case.
The first issue is whether the statute, section

12

1152(a)(1), was violated by the Department's policy when

13

that policy was in existence and before the new statute

14

came along.

15

The second issue is whether the change

16

instituted on September 30, 1

17

the right to relief.

18

QUESTION:

6 deprives respondents of

What is the relief -- if you were to

1

win on the first issue as you have described it, what

20

would your relief be?

21

MR. WOLF:

Well, the relief that we would

22

suggest, Justice Souter, is relief -- reparative relief,

23

relief that could, insofar as is possible, restore

24

plaintiffs to the position that they would have been in

25

were it not for the Department's illegal conduct.

So for instance, in the case of somebody who had

1

3

been -QUESTION:

Well, do you concede that if the

4

statute in fact was intended to be retroactive, that

5

relief would be impossible?

6

MR. WOLF:

If the statute was intended to be

7

retroactive, that relief would be impossible, but there's

8

nothing in the language of the statute indicating any

9

retroactive intent, and under this Court's decision in

10

Landgraf, a new law cannot be applied retroactively to

11

conduct predating its enactment if that conduct was

12

illegal, so the new law cannot reach back and render

13

lawful conduct that was unlawful at the time that conduct

14

was -- took place, and certainly we are -- respondents are

15

entitled to relief that would remedy the effects of the

16

illegal conduct.

17

QUESTION:

But what you're asking -- you still

18

haven't gotten the final judgment in this case, and what

19

you're asking for is some sort of a declaration or

20

injunction that the Secretary may not require repatriation

21

from Hong Kong in order to process visas.

22

Now, the traditional view is that we apply the

23

law in effect when the -- when our Court decides a case,

24

or the court of appeals applies the law when it -- in

25

effect when it decides it.

If the law in effect now is

1

that your clients are not entitled to any statutory

2

relief, I don't see where your idea of reparative relief

3

goes anywhere in the light of the new statute.
MR. WOLF:

4

Mr. Chief Justice, first just to

5

clarify the type of relief that we're seeking, we're

6

seeking an order mandating the processing and the

7

expeditious processing in Hong Kong of our clients' visa

8

applications, not an order that would have anything to do

9

with enforceable repatriation, per se.
QUESTION:

10

But if under presently enforced law

11

you're not entitled to that, the fact that you might have

12

been entitled to it a year ago is something that a court

13

ordinarily won't recognize.
MR. WOLF:

14

Well, certainly, were the statute to

15

be one that prohibited this Court from issuing an

16

injunction or from granting the -- granting respondents

17

the relief they're seeking, then that would be correct,

18

but the situation here is that respondents had a

19

substantive right to be -- to not be discriminated

20

against --

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Well, what do you mean by a

substantive right?
MR. WOLF:

Well, we had -- at the time we had an

24

expectation, a reasonable expectation that we would not be

25

discriminated against in the issuance of a visa.

Under

1

Landsgraf, the new statute cannot reach back and make

2

determinations --

3

QUESTION:

Well, that's true if you're seeking

4

damages, but just -- your whole effort here was

5

prospective.

6

MR. WOLF:

The principle of nonretroact -- of

7

the principle concerning retroactivity applies, as I

8

understand it, regardless of the type of relief that's

9

being sought.

The point is, is that this Court has the

10

power to remedy the past effects of the illegal conduct,

11

so there's nothing to prevent this Court from restoring

12

respondents to the situation they would have been in were

13

it not for the illegal conduct.

14

QUESTION:

But I think you have conceded that we

15

don't have that power if, number 1, you are not seeking

16

damages, and you're not, and number 2, the statute is in

17

fact to be applied retroactively.

18

assumptions, there's nothing we or any court could do,

19

even on your own premise, but apply the new statute, and

20

that would be the end of the case.

21
22

MR. WOLF:

On those two

Justice Souter, that's correct if the

statute were to be applied retroactively.

23

QUESTION:

So everything turns on the

24

retroactivity of the statute.

QUESTION:

1

And why should that be decided in the

2

court of appeals where normally the first cut at an issue

3

like that is, of course, not taken in this Court?

4

MR. WOLF:

Well, I would say that there are two

5

reasons in this particular case.

The first reason is a

6

concern regarding forcible repatriation.

7

has received certain representations from the Hong Kong

8

Government that lapsed on January 31, 1997.

The Department

9

Given the proceedings in this case and the pace

10

that it has gone at, we can't be confident that on remand

11

we would be able to get relief after the appellate process

12

and so on before the lapse of that time.

13

itself takes several weeks.

14

QUESTION:

The processing

Mr. Wolf, the D.C. Circuit was

decision of the three-judge panel that is the problem, not

2

the initial -- the district court was just following the

3

orders that the three-judge panel gave.

4

MR. WOLF:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that gets me

5

to the next point about why a remand would be

6

inappropriate in this case, and that is is that nothing

7

about the change in statute alters the fact that the

8

Department's conduct was illegal at the time that conduct

9

took place.

21

Ginsburg, that it may be improvident for this Court to

retain the certiorari petition as we indicated in our

QUESTION:

1

Why yet again?

The very fact that

2

the D.C. Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc is a

3

signal, is it not, that the Court was quite divided and

4

was not content to let it rest with the panel decision?

5

MR. WOLF:

It was a signal that the Court viewed

6

it as a serious question, as this Court's granting of

7

certiorari is such a signal, but for the same reason that

8

this Court might want to relinquish this case, the D.C.

9

Circuit en banc could do well the same.
QUESTION:

10

At any --

Mr. Wolf, I have an unrelated

11

question.

12

represented in the supplemental brief that a remand of the

13

case would cause the Hong Kong Government's undertaking to

14

lapse and would likely subject respondents to immediate

15

forcible repatriation.

16

It has to do with the latest submission.

You

That's a rather startling representation, and

17

when I looked back at the pleading that wasn't even

18

printed for this Court, it was the Government's response

19

to your motion to joint parties, and I saw when I read to

20

Mr. Kneedler that the Government represented that they

21

would obtain -- had obtained assurances from the Hong Kong

22

Government that no one would be forcibly repatriated

23

during the appellate and Supreme Court proceedings in this

further -- get further representations from the Hong Kong

Government.

We spoke with

We were left certainly with the clear

impression that that was not going to happen, and -QUESTION:

Before alleging to this Court that it

12

would cause immediate repatriation, do you not think it

would have been appropriate to let us know that the

14

Government had something quite -- said something quite the

15

contrary, had represented to this Court that no one was

16

going to be repatriated pending the proceedings here and

17

in Lisa Le?

18

MR. WOLF:

Well, as I indicated, Justice

19

Ginsburg, we believed there to be some ambiguity,

20

significant ambiguity in that statement.

21

We checked with the Government.

Apparently they

22

believed there to be enough ambiguity to go back to the

going to do, and that ended up being the situation as it

exists today.

There is an effective date provision,

MR. WOLF:

There are various different effective

There are 12 provisions that are

MR. WOLF:

I'm not sure, Justice Scalia, whether

there's a -- we checked, and I didn't recall seeing a

default retroactive provision, but I believe the statute

becomes effective on the date that it is enacted for -- as

the default provision, and to that degree it is certainly

21

the case that should the Department today institute a

policy refusing to process visa applications on -- and

discriminating in that process on grounds of race,

nationality, or sex, then a person would not be able to

There is nothing in the statute indicating that the --

12

indicating that the statute was intended to retroactively

legalize conduct which was unlawful at the time.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but I have a little trouble with

the language because your basic position is, as I

MR. WOLF:

Section 11 -- yes, that's correct.

East Coast would not have rendered the classification

10

received an inquiry from its consulate as to whether or

not the processing of a screened-out boat person would

violate the CPA.

13

The Department said that to require such a boat

14

person to return to Vietnam to have their visas processed

15

was procedural overkill and not at all necessary to the

16

integrity of the CPA and, in fact, during 4 years of the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Several points, Mr. Chief

11

Justice.

12

the intervening statute authorizes or affects the

13

propriety of prospective relief, application of the new

14

provision is not retroactive, so analytically the question

15

here is not one of retroactivity, since prospective relief

16

is being asked for, and that's what the Court is being

17

asked to do.

18

First of all, in Landgraf this Court said when

This statute specifically speaks to what a court

19

should do, whether a court can construe 1152(a)(1) to

20

prohibit the Secretary from establishing locations for the

21

processing of visas, as Justice Stevens mentioned.

22

QUESTION:

But Mr. Kneedler, to the extent that

23

this is like a venue provision where you can have this

24

processed, if Congress changes a venue rule while a case

25

is in a tribunal, I assume the case would not have to be

dismissed at midstream, that unless Congress said

2

otherwise, the venue that was proper when the case was

3

initiated would stay.

MR. KNEEDLER:

But that would be -- that would I

5

think be not upset -- I mean, again, that would be a

6

question of statutory construction, it would not be a

7

question of an injunctive action.

8

of a rule of procedure to be applied in an ongoing case

9

much like Landgraf, speaking to what a court has to do,

It would be a question

10

has to decide at the time it's deciding a particular issue

11

in a case.

12

decides venue, and the statute shouldn't reach back and

13

change that.

14

At the time the court decides venue, it

This statute is not retroactive in the sense

15

that people who got visas in 1993 during the interim

16

period when the State Department had a contrary view, will

17

have those visas taken away and be sent back to Hong Kong.

18

This is entirely prospective, and if there was any doubt

19

about Congress' intent that this governed this case, the

20

letter from the 45 Members of Congress said that the

21

amendment would overturn the adverse result in LAVAS.

22

The State Department's letter said it's

23

amendment was intended to reverse the decision in LAVAS.

24

Representative Smith said it was an attempt to overrule

25

LAVAS, and Representative Conyers said it would have the

precisely these two dozen Vietnamese in Hong Kong, to

Also, as the Chief Justice pointed out, this is

12

13

not invidious discrimination by any means.

14

Vietnamese have been the beneficiaries of United States

15

immigration policy over the last 15 years to an extent

16

that few other countries have matched:

challenging foreign policy and migration policy halfway

2

around the world in a suit brought by aliens in a foreign

3

country objecting to the way in which their visas are

being processed in a foreign country, a classic matter for

been committed to agency discretion by law.

7

And that rule cannot be circumvented by having a

U.S. citizen who happens to have applied for a visa

9

petition to file his or her own suit in U.S. courts.

The

10

Immigration Act makes clear that the visa petitioner's

11

interest in a matter such as this is simply filing the

12

visa petition and having the Attorney General determine

13

whether the beneficiary of the visa petition would be

14

entitled to a visa preference.

15

Once that happens, the U.S. person's interest in

16

the matter lapses.

There is no further interest.

The

17

alien abroad is accorded a preference and stands entirely

18

on his own or her own with respect to whether there will

19

be any admission to the United States.

In fact, the nondiscrimination provision invoked
