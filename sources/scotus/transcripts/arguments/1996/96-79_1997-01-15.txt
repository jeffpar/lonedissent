ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
ERISA is a comprehensive Federal program

12

designed to ensure that employees and their beneficiaries

13

receive their retirement benefits.

14

be applied uniformly throughout the country so that

15

employees in other parts -- all parts of the country are

16

treated equally.

17

It is also designed to

How does ERISA accomplish this goal?

By

18

preemption.

19

statutory beneficiaries who are entitled to receive

20

benefits under these retirement plans.

21

designated statutory beneficiaries are included in the

22

list, and only those beneficiaries are permitted to

23

receive benefits.

Additionally, Congress has created a list of

significant takings issue right off the bat?

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

2

QUESTION:

I don't

Because a State recognizes a

3

community property interest in something like a husband's

4

retirement plan or other assets that he has acquired

5

during the marriage by virtue of his efforts, that law

6

creates -- a community property law would create a

7

property right in the spouse to half of whatever that

8

asset is, and along comes an ERISA law later -- after this

9

marriage, the first marriage had been in existence and she

10

had an interest there, along comes ERISA.

11

preempts it, even though that would be a taking of her

12

interest.

Is that right?

13
14

You say it

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

No, Your Honor.

I don't

believe --

15

QUESTION:

16

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

What's wrong with that analysis?
Well, there are two problems.

17

In the first place, this Court has said on several

18

occasions, including Wissner v. Wissner, that the Federal

19

program does not constitute a taking under the Fifth

20

Amendment.

21

QUESTION:

But that was a statute that had gone

22

into effect and no one claimed that there was a prior

23

thing that was affected by the statute.

24

started working in 1949, and ERISA comes along in 1975.

25

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Here, this fellow

This -- well, at the time that

ERISA comes along it preempts State law, the State

2

community property law, so that it is inapplicable.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I'm not sure that's right,

4

but even if it were, it would constitute a taking of the

5

wife's interest acquired to that date.

6

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Acquired to that date.

Well,

7

the wife's interest that's acquired to that date is

8

similar to putting money into a trust.

9

money into the trust, she becomes -- if she lives long

When she puts this

10

enough she becomes a surviving spouse and is entitled to

11

benefits as a beneficiary.

12

beneficiaries.

13

QUESTION:

ERISA speaks in terms of

Well, under community property law in

14

Louisiana she owned half of whatever he made from 1949

15

till ERISA at least was passed, and ERISA, even if you

16

give it effect, can't take that without giving her

17

compensation.

18

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Her compensation was the

19

anticipation of the benefits she would have received had

20

she become -- had she lived long enough to receive them

21

coming out of the back end of the -- a retirement program.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Government can't simply

23

substitute one piece of property for another piece of

24

property without them being somehow equal.

25

would simply disappear under your view in 1975, although

Yes, but that was a Government life
That wasn't private property.

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Well, to the extent that the

benefits she would receive as a -- had she lived to
10

participate in the retirement benefits are so much

11

greater, and fuels -- it's really tax dollars.

12

exemptions and the tax deferrals fuel the ERISA engine

13

that creates the wealth that creates the much greater

14

benefits at the end than she would expect to receive just

15

by investing some portion of her --

16

QUESTION:

The tax

What she would get by outliving her

17

husband isn't what troubles me.

18

like having an ownership in a lottery ticket, and by the

time the event occurs that brings ERISA into it the

lottery has been run and the ticket is a loser.

It seems to me that's

So also,

it's worthless here

me, but isn't she entitled -- isn't she entitled to the --

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

She is

In a community property State,

entitlement that's half hers, and that does continue,

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

She's entitled, as a -- as the

wife of the participant during retirement she would

receive benefits and would enjoy the retirement benefits.

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia is completely capable

10

of protecting his own question, but it seems to me that

11

he's asking you --

12

QUESTION:

Go, Tony,

I --

13

QUESTION:

He thinks that he -- I thought that

14

he was asking the question as a matter of Louisiana

provides, but as a matter of Louisiana community property

law,

is it not?

if there

had been no ERISA at all, would the first wife have had

something to bequeath by will?

would have?

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

QUESTION:

Do you agree that she

Yes.

So that premise is correct.
That is correct.

I find that troubling, but what I'm

8

not clear on is whether I have to reach that particular

9

trouble.

10

Has anyone raised the issue of a taking in this

case?

11

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

12

QUESTION:

13

May I also ask in that -- does the

record tell us when the husband's pension benefits vested?

14
15

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:
that.

when he first started paying in.

2

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

No.

3

QUESTION:

No.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if there is a takings problem

5

in the case, though, isn't that a reason for interpreting

6

ERISA so that it doesn't raise that problem by saying that

7

there isn't the sort of preemption that you're arguing

8

for?

9

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Well, the result there is that

10

if that -- if you reach that and you say that there is no

11

preemption, then State law in effect redefines who the

12

beneficiaries of ERISA are, because if you say that there

13

is no preemption of the community property law, then the

14

nonparticipant spouse becomes --

15

QUESTION:

Well, not at all.

There's a

16

statutory argument here to be addressed if we wish, I

17

guess, and that's whether there was any alienation here at

18

all under the statutory provision in ERISA.

19

If Dorothy's estate, if she had a community

20

property interest in part of what was distributed to Isaac

21

by virtue of Louisiana law, when she dies, why doesn't

22

that interest, whatever it is, just continue to exist as

23

part of her estate, and once there is a distribution, why

24

doesn't her estate stand in her former shoes and say part

25

of that is mine, and she -- that isn't an alienation under

benefits in that instance.

3

QUESTION:

Well, you focus a lot on the 1984

amendments to ERISA, but I thought that Dorothy Boggs died

5

in 1979, so how could that affect it?

how could the 1984 amendments --

QUESTION:

10

How could that --

He didn't retire --

-- construe what the law was at the

time she died?
MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Well, he didn't retire until

11

1985, at which point the 1984 amendments applied and the

12

selection or the choice to take the joint survivor's

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

2

QUESTION:

You can leave it to your wife.

Yes, and if the State law says that

3

this money has to go to John Black or to my wife, is there

4

any problem with that?

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

6

QUESTION:

No.

No.
And if State law says when you

she had a community property interest, is that any

No.
Then if that's no different, and

if the wife, knowing that she gets it, happens to write a

how is that different from this case as to the money?

2

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

3

QUESTION:

Well, when the --

I mean, I don't want to have mixed

4

you up with all the questions, but as I'm seeing it, all

5

this is is a State law called a community property law

6

that says what will happen on the death of the husband to

7

the money that was a fixed sum that came into the

8

possession of the wife because of State law community

9

property, and she later on left it by will but she didn't,

10

because there was another State law -- or whatever, but to

11

somebody else.

12

Maybe the SG will answer that question, because

I -- and if the answer depends on the IRA, that, I think,

had to do with tax purposes.

But she would if she divorced him,

3

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Well, but State court could,

4

under the QDRO, give her rights in it.

5

automatically have rights.
QUESTION:

6

She does not

Yes, but Judge Fletcher said one of

7

the many anomalies in this case is, you take a woman who

8

under State law is a coowner, and she stays a coowner.

9

before she dies, predeceasing her husband, she divorces

If

10

him, then her coownership can be realized and she can pass

11

it on to her children.
But if she should stay with him till her last

12

13

breath, then her coownership vanishes, and I suppose Judge

14

Fletcher was saying, if there is another construction

15

that's reasonable, we ought to apply that, rather than one

16

that leads to this very odd result.

17

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

Except that the results is that

18

under that -- under Judge Fletcher's construction she

19

basically would have the surviving participant who has

20

anticipated receiving these benefits and has contributed

21

to them thinking that he is going to retire, he suddenly

22

has to divide his benefits with people who are not

retirees.

may have left this money.
QUESTION:

2

Ms. Livaudais, could I ask you,

3

regarding Justice Breyer's question, do you acknowledge

4

that the only effect of a community property law is to say

5

how the husband's property goes when he dies, which seemed

6

to me to be the hypothesis of Justice Breyer's question?

7

Doesn't the community property law make it her

8

property immediately, before the husband dies, so it isn't
a question of the husband getting all the money at the end

10

and State law just saying where the husband's property

11

goes.

12

property law says that it is her property.

13

hers at the outset.

Your contention is that it is -- or the community

14

Half of it is

She doesn't get half at his death.

MRS. LIVAUDAIS:

No, but it -- but my contention

15

is that ERISA preempts the application of that community

16

property law from the moment that ERISA was passed, and

17

therefore ERISA dictates that these benefits are

18

MR. DEANO:

First of all, with regard to the

12

lump sum payments, clearly the antialienation provisions,

13

once they've been paid out of the plan, don't apply, and

14

there's a whole line of jurisprudence that sets that out.
But what's I think very important conceptually

15
16

to understand, and this Court has spoken to that in the

17

Mackey case and also in the Fort Halifax case, is there's

18

a distinct difference between State laws that deal with

19

benefits and those that deal with plans, and that the

20

preemption clause is not designed to preempt State laws

21

that deal with benefits, and that makes sense.

22

If you preempted the law that dealt with

23

benefits, you could never get to defined rights, because

24

those laws would have been preempted, so you couldn't have

25

a QDRO.

interesting, I think, to take a look at the antialienation

If that says that

6

that would seem like a direct conflict.

7

MR. DEANO:

Why isn't it?

Because this Court has decided that

those types of conflicts are treated in the context of the

9

antialienation provisions, not the preemption provisions.

QUESTION:

Well then, why?

Then tell me,

MR. DEANO:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
That as a matter of State law,

husband and wife 1 work together for 30 years, build up a

9

million dollars in an IRA, or in some kind of a retirement

10

account with a pension, and at the end, eventually wife 1

12

buy an annuity which says, $2,000 a month to husband, on

13

husband's death, $1,000 a month to wife 2.
You are saying under the law of Louisiana, since

14
15

that $1 million which paid for the annuity was jointly

16

built up during their community, wife 1 is entitled to

17

one-half the proceeds of that eventually, or some share of

that.

Is that right?

MR. DEANO:

I don't understand your argument about the significance of

would otherwise give rise to a preemption.
MR. DEANO:

Well,

let's just -- from the plan.

Oh.
Under this plan, what would they get?
They would not at that moment get

anything, but they -QUESTION:

No, when he died.

everything is exactly the same as it is now.

All right.

QUESTION:

2

MR. DEANO:

3

Except, he doesn't remarry.
Okay.

The only thing -- he doesn't

get -- they do not get a thing from the plan.

QUESTION:

5

MR. DEANO:

6

QUESTION:

What about the $150,000?
Yes.
So the $150,000 you treat separately.

7

Let's say that's -- we have to assume that went to a bank

8

account or something.
QUESTION:

Is that accurate?
So the lump -- there's a difference

10

between the lump sum and the stock as opposed to the

11

survivor's annuity.

12

MR. DEANO:

That's correct.

The consideration

13

for the survivor's annuity, however, was the reduced

14

retirement moneys paid to Isaac during the remainder --

15

upon his retirement, for which he purchased this --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but that's the deal.

That's

17

just like the husband and wife agreeing to sell a piece

of -- sell an automobile for a boat.

20

I mean, you don't

If they went into the deal and traded the one

21

for the other, it's gone, and what you have is what's in

22

front of you, so it doesn't seem to me to say, well, they

23

got this money only because they took less of something

24

else -- that was what they bought.

MR. DEANO:

Except there was something there at

this moment, Your Honor.

I mean, it would be like

2

presuming there wasn't something there when in fact there

3

was something there.

k

I would just like to close by mentioning again

4
5

that the remedy on State laws that confuse or are

6

troubling to Federal concepts with regard to ERISA is not

7

preemption, that it comes under the antialienation

8

provisions.
QUESTION:

10

you.

Do you have a better argument for the lump sum than

11

you do for the annuity?
MR. DEANO:

12

,

Mr. Wolfson, I'm sorry to interrupt

My argument with regard to the lump

13

sum is the antialienation provisions do not apply once

14

they've left the plan.
QUESTION:

15

But do you have a better argument for

16

the lump sum than the annuity?

17

MR. DEANO:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

The argument --

Justice Thomas is asking you to weigh

19

the two arguments, which do you think is the better one, I

20

believe.

21

MR. DEANO:

Oh, I would find that there are --

22

there is equal authority from this Court for both of them.

23

Probably the occasion has risen more with regard to the

24

antialienation protections following after the benefits

25

leave the plan.

That doctrine may be more rounded -50

QUESTION:

1

Well, I think where you're losing

2

me -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but where you're losing me

MR. DEANO:

he would have received more benefits.

MR. DEANO:

8

There is nothing to give away, but

So what?
So that his estate would have been

No, but it would have increased the

I don't understand -- I just don't understand

Now, what is it in the

your argument.

5

MR. DEANO:

6

QUESTION:

Well -That he -- there is no annuity.

The

7

only annuity available is for the survivor benefits.

8

There is no survivor because he never remarried, so what

is it for the children to get?
MR. DEANO:

10

The rights that the children get is

11

the right to account for their money that was being

12

used --

QUESTION:

14

MR. DEANO:

They didn't have any.
They did have money.

There was
