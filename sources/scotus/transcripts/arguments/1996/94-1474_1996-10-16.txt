CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Idaho.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIVE J. STRONG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STRONG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

Although States are part of the Union, they

12

nonetheless retain certain attributes of sovereignty.

13

of those retained attributes of sovereignty, the States

14

sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment and a

15

State's entitlement to lands beneath the beds and banks of

16

navigable waters under the equal footing doctrine are at

17

issue in this case.

18

Two

The State of Idaho has been in possession of the

19

beds and banks of the navigable waters of Lake Coeur

20

d'Alene since Statehood.

21

State, pursuant to its duty, has regulated those lands for

22

the benefit of the public as a whole.

23

the Tribe seeks to divest the State of that possession and

24

instead reside it with the Tribe.

25

Pursuant to that possession, the

1

that this action by the Tribes with respect to quiet title

2

claims was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and

3

nonetheless, the court proceeded to allow the suit with

4

respect to the State officers to proceed under the

5

rationale of Ex parte Young.

6

Under the injunctive and declaratory relief

7

sought by the Tribe, the Tribe would be awarded quiet

8

title and exclusive possession of these lands.

9

QUESTION:

But it would not, as I understand it,

10

be a decree that would estop the State if the State later

11

wanted to contest the title.

MR. STRONG:

17

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor -Isn't that correct?
No, Your Honor, it's not.
You think the State would suffer

Your Honor, by the very nature of

18

these properties, it is impossible to separate the title

19

from the possession of the property.

20

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but in one sense it's

21

always impossible to separate the officer from the State,

22

but that's what Ex parte Young does, and I would have

23

thought that the State's ultimate fear would be that if --

24

if it had an ultimate fear, is that if the officers lost

the suit, that the State would lose its title, and I would

have thought if for no other reason than the very nature

2

of the Eleventh Amendment claim that the State had, that

3

there would be no issue preclusion against the State if

4

the State either later wished voluntarily to litigate its

5

question of title, or was sued in a State court for that

6

purpose.

7

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, the very nature of this

8

lands is what brings the difficult interplay with Ex parte

9

Young.

Under the officer's suit rationale it is assumed

10

that the State simply could bring another action to clear

11

its title to these lands, but if the Tribe were awarded

12

possession of these lands, under section 28 2409a, the

13

Federal Quiet Title Act specifically precludes an action

14

by the State against the United States Government for

15

possessions of lands held in trust for the benefit of the

16

Tribe.

17

the State from bringing an action against the tribal --

18

against the - -

20
21

Likewise, tribal sovereign immunity would preclude

QUESTION:

So you're saying it's the Quiet Title

Act that would in effect require the preclusion?
MR. STRONG:

The Quiet Title Act would because

22

of the language in the act that precludes an action by a

23

State against the United States for lands that are held in

24

trust for the benefit of the Tribe.

25

argument would be made - -

1

2

State could perfect its title, is it?

3
4

No, but that's not the only way the

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, that would be the only

way the State could perfect its title in this case.

5

QUESTION:

He could walk in and seize the land,

6

I presume, send in the State National Guard and wait for

7

somebody to sue to get it off the land.

8

that?

9

MR. STRONG:

Couldn't it do

Your Honor, the State would be

10

bound to abide by lawful orders of this Court.

11

officers are the ones that are being enjoined from

12

possession of these lands --

13

QUESTION:

The State

The whole theory is that that doesn't

14

run against the State, it just runs against the State

15

officers.

16

that's all.

You've got to get some other State officer,

17

MR. STRONG:

18

through its officers.

proceeding, there is no way that the State can go forward.

QUESTION:

But the State cannot act but
If the officers are enjoined from

Supposing the State sends another

crop of officers who haven't been named in this particular

order, but certainly they would suspect the tribe would

2

immediately sue the State to enjoin those people from

3

taking possession of the lands.

4

QUESTION:

Now --

5

QUESTION:

Of course, it works the other way

6

around.

If you -- if you prevail on the merits with a

7

ruling by this Court that the President had no authority

8

to convey away the lands, I take it you would have the

9

benefit of that judgment.
MR. STRONG:

10
11

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't

understand the question.
QUESTION:

12

Suppose Idaho -- suppose the suit

13

were to go forward and Idaho would prevail in this suit,

14

or the officers would prevail in this suit, and it were

15

held that the land had not been conveyed to the Tribes,

16

that would work to your benefit, I take it.

17
18

MR. STRONG:

You could --

Yes, Your Honor, that would *work

to our benefit.

19

The nature of the Eleventh Amendment, *or the Ex

20

parte Young is a narrow exception to the Eleventh

21

Amendment.

22

must be interpreted in a way that accommodates the

23

substantial sovereign interest at stake under the Eleventh

24

Amendment, and as this Court has stated in the past --

25

As an exception to the Eleventh Amendment, it

a way that in fact the State is not bound?

2

always thought Ex parte Young was just a great fiction,

3

that in fact

4

is only against the officers, but as a fact - - as a

practical matter the State is, you know, is precluded.

You don't think that's the way it works normally?

I mean, I

percent of the time you can say the suit

MR. STRONG:

You're correct, Your Honor, it is a

fiction, and the fiction is that the suit can go forward
because it doesn't unnecessarily interfere with the

10

State's actions, but in this instance, because of the very

11

nature of the title of these lands, it interferes with the

12

State action.

13

The lands that we're talking about here are

14

lands that came to the State through the equal footing

doctrine.

16

sovereignty, as this Court stated in Oregon v. Corvallis

17

Sand & Gravel, that when you're dealing with submerged

18

lands you're not dealing with the issue of substantive

1

property law, but rather with the constitutional

20

sovereignty of the States.

The lands that are specifically identified with

So you're saying land and Treasury,

land and Treasury we won't apply Ex parte Young?

context, sovereign lands is the same as the Treasury.

the State receives as an incident of sovereignty, that

incidence of sovereignty, because of the very nature of

these lands, they're held open for the benefit of the

4

public as a whole, the State receives lands under an equal

5

footing doctrine, is required to manage those for the

6

benefit of the public for commerce, navigation, and other

7

purposes.
QUESTION:

8

9

But can't you say in any case in

which a State officer suffers an injunction, that the

10

State officer is thereby deflected from performing duties

11

which in the judgment of the State would be better

12

performed either for some other purpose, for the purpose

13

that it -- that the -- that was enjoined, and that there

14

is always a kind of frustration of State activity as a

15

result of it, and I don't -- for that reason, I don't see

16

why there is some peculiar status of lands, even when the

17

State has a sovereign purpose in holding the lands.
MR. STRONG:

18

Your Honor, these lands are

19

identified directly with sovereignty of the State.

20

this Court has said in the past - QUESTION:

21

As

Yes, but the right to exercise any

22

governmental function is identified with the sovereignty

23

of the State, and yet the officer who is ordered by the

24

State to perform that function can be enjoined under

25

Young.

1

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, if the officers are

2

enjoined in this action, however, the nature and title --

3

the title isn't in the actual ownership of the property,

4

but it's the regulation of that property for the benefit

5

of the public as a whole.

6

the ability to manage and regulate these lands for the

7

benefit of the whole, then the very sovereign nature of

8

that title is entirely defeated.

9

QUESTION:

If the officers are enjoined in

Well, it isn't entirely defeated if

10

the State has, as I assumed it had, a right to contest the

11

title in a forum of its own choosing, and therefore it

12

seems to me that what the State is suffering boils down to

13

the fact that if its officers lose this suit, the

14

consequences of that may very well precipitate the State

15

into having to litigate the title itself.

16

But what the Eleventh Amendment protects is not

17

circumstances requiring the State as a practical matter to

18

litigate, but rather, it protects it from being hauled

19

into a particular forum to do its litigation, and

20

therefore, if what the State is ultimately suffering is in

21

effect the precipitation of litigation in the absence of

22

which it will suffer in some way.

23

is the Eleventh Amendment's concern.

MR. STRONG:

I don't see that that

are enjoined from the regulation of these lands, the point

that I'm making is that the State does not have a remedy.

2

The State couldn't simply go out and commence another

3

action.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you -- let me put it this way.

5

If we were to hold,

the State would not be estopped as a result of this

judgment against the officers if it wishes later on to

litigate its title,

then you would have no quarrel,

MR. STRONG:

No, Your Honor, because this Court

11

cannot grant the relief the State would need to bring the

12

action because of the Federal Quiet Title Act, and

13

assuming that the Tribe was successful in obtaining

14

possession,

15

against the United States,

lands, would be precluded because those lands were held in

4

QUESTION:

MR. STRONG:

No.

The Federal Quiet Title Act

would have no limitation on the Tribe.

So it does not limit, in your view,

the Tribe from filing a quiet title action in State court?

6

Well, the Federal Quiet Title Act

QUESTION:

And the State of Idaho has waived its

sovereign immunity for such a suit.

9

MR. STRONG:

That is correct, Your Honor,

10

that -- our courts would be available to the Tribe to

11

fully pursue in the entirety the relief that they are

12

seeking in this action.

13

QUESTION:

What authority from this Court do you

14

rely on for the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment

15

bars adjudication of the State's sovereign title question

16

in Federal court?

17

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, we look to Treasure

18

Salvors.

19

split plurality opinion, all four justices on each side of

20

that plurality ultimately held that you cannot adjudicate

21

a State's title in the context of the Eleventh Amendment.

That would be precluded.

(800) FOR DEPO

The point that we're making here is, is that

1

2

under the presumption in Montana, which is a strong

3

presumption of State ownership, that the only way you can

4

determine that the - - the Court can determine that the

5

Tribe is entitled to possession of these lands is to first

6

determine that the presumption of State ownership has been

7

overcome, and that the United States abandoned its

8

traditional policy in favor of holding these lands in

9

trust.
Rather than the issue of taking tribal property,

10
11

this case really presents an issue of whether the United

12

States took the State's sovereign title and instead

13

bestowed it upon the Tribe.

14

this case, and because it involves the State's title is

15

why it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
QUESTION:

16

That is the very nature of

Mr. Strong, I understood you to say

17

that this case is about where the suit will be, and Idaho

18

has a State court remedy, a State court where this

19

disputed question can be tried out.

20

existence of that remedy, essential to your position?

21

Let's suppose Idaho did not choose to consent to be sued

on this matter at all, would your position be any

different?

1

action against the State, directly against the State, and

2

since this is a determination of the State's title, it

3

would be precluded by the Eleventh Amendment regardless of

4

the unavailability of the forum.

5

QUESTION:

So you're saying that Idaho has

6

chosen to give the Tribe a remedy in Idaho's own courts,

7

but doesn't have to, so we would be left with the anomaly,

8

if Idaho hadn't consented to be sued in its own courts, of

9

a dispute over title determined by Federal law, right,

10

because both sides are --

11

MR. STRONG:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
-- staking their claim on Federal

13

law, and no Federal court could hear it, and a State court

14

has chosen not to hear it.

15

MR. STRONG:

No, Your Honor, there is another

16

remedy that's available to the Tribe which also takes us

17

outside the context of Ex parte Young.

18

A Tribe is a dependent sovereign Nation, is --

19

cannot hold legal title to these trust lands.

20

is held by the United States on behalf of the Tribe, so

21

the Tribe has a remedy here that's not traditionally

22

available in an Ex parte Young --

pursue that remedy.

1

the Tribe can petition the United States to bring an

2

action on its behalf, and if the United States fails to

3

take such action, and the Tribe believes that it should be

4

taking further action with respect to this property, it

5

has a remedy against the United States to bring an action,

6

breach of trust action against the United States to force

7

it to either litigate the title, or compensate it.
QUESTION:

8

9

Is there an action pending now which

the United States has brought?
MR. STRONG:

10

Yes, Your Honor, there is an action

11

pending in the United States District Court in Idaho, and

12

that action is properly brought under Texas v. -- United

13

States v. Texas.

14

by the trustee of these lands as against the State of

15

Idaho.

United States to bring an action on its behalf.

The State has no objection to an action

The law is very clear on that matter.

It again verifies the fact that there is a

QUESTION:

20

Of course, even if that remedy did

21

not exist, as well as the remedy of suit in State court,

22

which you say also exists, it still would not be a unique

23

situation.

24

Tribe not being able to get relief would presumably not be

25

unique, or relief in Federal court --

Presumably -- namely that the situation of the

MR. STRONG:

2

QUESTION:

Would not be
-- because that's presumably the

3

situation with respect to all claims to money from the

4

State Treasury.
MR. STRONG:

5

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

6

very nature of the Eleventh Amendment creates this tension

7

where there may not be an available remedy, and the idea

8

of Ex parte Young was to address that situation, but as

9

I've demonstrated both through the action by the Tribe in

10

State court, or by the action of the United States, the

11

rationale for Ex parte Young is not applicable in the

12

context - QUESTION:

13
14

How do you distinguish the old case

of Tindal v. Wesley?
MR. STRONG:

15

Tindal v. Wesley has been limited

16

by the Larson case, and in that -- what it basically says

17

is that there has to be either an action by the officer

18

acting ultra vires, Larson does, or alternatively that

19

there has to be some violation of Federal law.
There is no allegation in this suit that the

20
21

State officers were acting any -- outside of their

22

authority.

23

what was expected of them under the presumption of Federal

24

ownership, that is, regulating these lands on behalf of

25

the public as a whole.

In fact, the State officers are doing exactly

1

As to the Federal question, as to whether

2

there's a violation of Federal law, as I - - this is not an

3

instance where the State is taking tribal property but

4

rather, the question is whether the United States took the

5

State's entitlement and instead vested it to the Tribe,

6

this, very much similar to, say, the Oregon v. Hitchcock

2

notion that it's a State affirmatively acting in - - as a

3

private citizen to take its property, and that it's a

4

taking that brings those actions into play, and the

5

rationale of Lee is that we need that kind of rule to

6

avoid the tyranny of the Government simply confiscating

7

State property -- or, I mean, private property for benefit

8

of State governmental actions.

9

We contend that under the equal footing doctrine

10

that concern is not present in this case because the State

11

entered into possession as a result of Statehood, and it's

12

been in possession for over a century with respect to

13

those lands, and so we simply don't have that problem

14

before us today.

15

Likewise, as to whether the conduct of the

16

officer is unlawful, which is a premise of Ex parte Young,

17

there is nothing in the conduct of the officers here that

18

would suggest that they're violating any Federal law.

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, if the Tribe is right

on the merits there would be a violation of the Federal

rights, but in this context you --

It seems to me your argument is sort

5

of proceeding on the assumption that they're wrong on the

6

merits, an issue we don't reach until we decide the

7

threshold question.

8

MR. STRONG:

No, Your Honor.

In determining

9

this case you must first consider the applicable law, and

10

the applicable law under Montana v. United States is that

11

you must presume State ownership of these submerged lands

12

absent an express congressional conveyance, and until that

13

is established, the State is entitled to operate as it has

14

in the past, that it is entitled to the ownership of these

15

beds and banks, and until that issue is resolved, it is

16

impossible to state that the State officers are not acting

17

consistent with Federal law.

MR. STRONG:

Which is a rebuttable presumption.
That is a rebuttable presumption,

but nonetheless it's a strong presumption, and the Court

4

is required to begin with that presumption in any analysis

5

of an equal footing conveyance situation, and given that

6

presumption --

7

QUESTION:

But isn't there also a presumption in

8

the Ex parte Young area that State action is generally

considered lawful and constitutional?

You always start

10

with a presumption of constitutionality whenever you

11

challenge State action.

12

MR. STRONG:

Your Honor, the essence of what

13

we're trying to contend before the Court today is that

14

under Ex parte Young you start with the premise that a

15

well pled complaint alleges a violation of some Federal

16

law, a supremacy issue, and the contention we make today

17

is that there is no Supremacy Clause question here,

18

because if the State is correct and you are required to

19

assume that the State is correct because of the

20

presumption until it's litigated, then the State is acting

21

consistent with Federal law.

Well, isn't your -- isn't the essence

of your argument, I guess, and your best answer to Justice

8

Stevens, if I understood you earlier, that Ex parte Young

9

is concerned with a situation in which the plaintiff

claims under Federal law, and the officers sued are

Well, there may be problems with it we just

discussed, but the State officers merge Federal officer

suits and State officer suits and pick and choose bits and

pieces of cases back and forth, when in reality when

they're looked at carefully they really come from

11

protecting different interests in the Eleventh Amendment

The Federal officer suits are designed to

provide a remedy primarily in the takings area, and as

Congress has provided those remedies, be it the quiet

Your Honor, there's no question but

what the State officers thrust that forward as their

argument, but I think the more appropriate way to analyze

11

the issue here is that the Tribe claims ownership based on

Federal law, and as a result of that claimed ownership,

13

asking the Federal court to enjoin State officers from

14

their regulation of the Tribe's lake under State law.

then the State officers come back on the

it's just as Justice Souter was describing in his

are acting beyond their authority ultra vires, or their

the officer's ability as a State officer to violate the

Supremacy Clause, and that is where the State officer and

Federal officer cases depart, Your Honor, and I think it

7

is why it is so important to keep clearly in mind which

8

interest is really being protected.

9

In the State officer cases the constitutional

10

interest that is at issue is the supremacy of Federal law,

11

it is not the -- whether or not the State officer is

12

acting within or without his authority.

13

That State officer can be acting within his

14

authority under State law and still be acting in violation

15

of Federal law unconstitutionally, and the thrust of all

16

of Ex parte Young jurisprudence is that this -- the

17

Federal court still should appropriately provide a remedy

acting properly or improperly, but to uphold the supremacy

Please.

3

appreciate some clarification on this question of title

submerged land.

10

I don't

I don't know what laws it could enforce.

It sounds like you're getting the property.
The only reason I suppose that title came in is,

11
12

in a case called Tindal the Court held that a suit just

13

like this one wasn't really against the State, though it

14

is, but nonetheless we give the State an escape hatch,

15

that because of the last paragraph the State won't be

16

bound as to title, thus they get an extra chance to come

back and fight it if they want.

I'm happy that that is correct, if it is,

but I mean, I'm trying to follow through the intricacies.

I got your argument before that you thought in reality Ex

6

the assertion of the Federal interest in States obeying

7

Federal law.

8

MR. GIVENS:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And you think that you can't

distinguish real property cases where the Federal law

11

gives the property to Jones, or Smith, or the Indian tribe

12

from cases involving mental hospitals, schools, churches,

13

whatever.

Is that right?
MR. GIVENS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

They're both based on the supremacy of Federal law.

QUESTION:

All right, but then we run into this

17

doctrine, and you think Tindal is strongly in support of

18

you.
MR. GIVENS:

19

It is to the extent, Your Honor,

20

that Tindal said clearly that you -- the Federal court can

enjoin a State officer who is holding property

unconstitutionally without adjudicating the title to that

property.

officers were claiming here, were claiming rights to

regulate in the enforcement of State law.

3

In other words, it wasn't merely a matter of two

4

contesting titles, there was State law which had been

5

enacted to determine just how the State would regulate,

6

and what it would do, and that therefore the contest here

7

was really a contest between a claim of superior title on

8

the one hand and a claim to enforce particular State laws
which ultimately implied a contrary claim of title, is

10

that right?

11

MR. GIVENS:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Are we in a position to assess that

13

answer, because I thought the very answer that you gave to

14

Justice Kennedy earlier was that there are no specific

15

detailed claims against State officers at this point,

16

that's just not the state of the pleadings, and you said,

17

well, we ought to go back and amend.

acts of regulation by particular State officers enforcing

you lose on some of those, and there are some that's left,

and instead of having the opportunity then to amend as you

would on remand normally, all of a sudden you're up here

5

The preliminary nature of this case makes it

6

very difficult to deal with this -- not only this issue,

7

but also the Property Clause issue, and if I could just

8

address that for just a moment, the tension in the

9

Property Clause that the State officers raise is really

10

between the executive and the Congress.

State officers are asking for a unique exception to some

And, again, the

One quick point with regard to the Eleventh

two questions that were posed by this panel to Mr. Givens,

one by Justice O'Connor, and one by Justice Ginsburg.

20

I would like to go back to a question,

As Justice Ginsburg rightly points out, what the

21

Tribe seeks, and it's stated in their response brief on

22

page 4, what remains in the suit is declaratory and

23

injunctive relief against Idaho officers to stop their

violation of Federal law and to quiet the title, the

departments.
And as Justice O'Connor rightly observed, the

2

3

essence of title to property is the opportunity to possess

4

that property, and that's particularly true with respect

5

to sovereign submerged lands.
As this Court said in Oregon v. Corvallis Sand &

6

7

Gravel, submerged lands cannot be compared to substantive

8

property law, but rather as an issue substantially related

9

to constitutional sovereignty of the States.
The unique aspect of that sovereign title --

10

11

there is a legal title and a public title -- is the

12

responsibility of the State to manage those lands for the

13

benefit of the public.

14

carrying out that sovereign duty, how can it be said that

1

than the case we have before us, because in Tindal it was

2

an issue where the officers through their actions came

3

into possession of the property.

4

These officers have no relationship to the title

5

here.

The title passed to the State on Statehood.

We've

6

possessed it since that date, and so the officer's duties,

7

what they're doing, have no relationship to title

8

whatsoever, and so the only way you could bring in Tindal

9

is to say that the officers are taking the property.

10

How can it be said that they're taking the

11

property if they have never, by their own actions, took

12

possession of the land, but rather, came into possession

13

as a result of the constitutional presumption?

14

QUESTION:

Idaho could have no complaint, could

15

they, except for a defense on the merits, if the United

16

States in its suit had chosen to litigate on behalf of the

17

Tribe for this entire -- for all the land that the Tribe

18

is now claiming, rather than just a part of it?

19

MR. STRONG:

Certainly not, Your Honor.

If the

20

United States had felt that there was a basis for making a

21

claim for the entire lake, it could have brought that

22

action and the State would have no objection to that type

23

of lawsuit.

QUESTION:

And there's nothing to indicate why

the United States -- in this record why the United States

sued for less than what the Tribe is claiming in this -MR. STRONG:

2

No, Your Honor, but the reasonable

3

assumption is that the United States has evaluated that

4

claim and determined that there isn't a Federal interest

5

in the northern two-thirds of the lake.
Turning to the last or second question we

6

7

presented to the Court, as Mr. Givens rightly points, that

8

his theory is based upon the idea that Midwest Oil somehow

9

gave the President authority by acquiescence of Congress,

10

and it's our position that the Property Clause powers are

11

vested exclusively within Congress, and then in the Sioux

12

Tribe the only way that authority can be delegated to the

13

President is by an express action of Congress.

14

This is particularly true with regard to the

15

submerged lands, which are held in trust for the future

16

States.

17

lands out of trust, then what aspect of sovereignty is

18

really being protected?

19

If a President can simply unilaterally take those

In fact, the sovereignty of States, they would

20

have no way of protecting themselves against such a

21

withdrawal.
Moreover, Midwest Oil is a very unique case.

22

23

It's limited to the situation in which the President is

24

withdrawing lands, public lands that are available for

25

sale.

In Midwest Oil, the Court found acquiescence to be

acceptable, because in that instance no third party was

2

being injured.

3

The State of Idaho is being injured by this

4

action because the lands were held in trust for the

5

benefit of the State, and if they're taken out of trust

6

and conveyed to the Tribe, then the State's sovereignty

7

has been injured.
