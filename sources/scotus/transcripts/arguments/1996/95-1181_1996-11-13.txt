CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY D. STUMPP

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. STUMPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Treasury Amendment to the Commodity Exchange

12

Act, which is quoted in full on page 1 of our brief,

13

provides in pertinent part, nothing in this chapter shall

14

be deemed to govern or in any way be applicable to

15

transactions in foreign currency unless such transactions

16

involve the sale thereof for future delivery conducted on

17

a board of trade.

18

The question presented in this case is whether

19

the Treasury Amendment excludes off-exchange foreign

20

currency options from CEA regulation, thus whether off-

21

exchange foreign currency options are transactions in the

22

foreign currency within the Treasury Amendment --

QUESTION:

Now, if it were a -- an off-exchange

futures deal -MR. STUMPP:

I'm sorry?

MR. STUMPP:

I believe -- yes, both parties

would agree, Your Honor.

10

than an off-exchange -QUESTION:

12

The only dispute is because it's

Why shouldn't futures and options be

treated the same?

13

MR. STUMPP:

I believe they should be, Your

14

Honor, and I believe both of them are exempt by the

15

Treasury Amendment, as long as they're off-exchange

16

transactions in foreign currency, whether in futures or in

17

options.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Although the Treasury Amendment

didn't really speak of the options.
MR. STUMPP:

No.

The Treasury Amendment spoke

21

broadly, Your Honor, of transactions in foreign currency.

22

It did not limit it to foreign currency futures.

23

broadly of transactions in foreign currency.

24

accordingly, the ordinary meaning of the phrase would

25

indicate that any transaction in which foreign currency is

the subject matter would be excluded by the Treasury

Amendment -- off-exchange.

3

QUESTION:

But there are some holdings that

4

distinguish transactions in from a future or an option

5

agreement.
MR. STUMPP:

6

I would think the holdings Your

7

Honor is referring to are certain holdings that have

8

distinguished off-exchange futures from off-exchange

9

options, along the lines that an option until exercised

10

does not become a transaction in the foreign currency

11

itself.

12

Honor is referring, I think they were -- first, I think

13

both courts that decided that way were dicta because you

14

were dealing with exchange traded futures, although that

15

was not the ground on which the courts went, and therefore

16

it would be subject -- it would not be subject to the act.

17
18
19

And if those are the decisions to which Your

QUESTION:

Exchange traded futures or exchange

traded options?
MR. STUMPP:

In the two cases I believe Justice

20

O'Connor is referring to -- is the Chicago Board of Trade

21

and the American Board of Trade case -- they both dealt

22

with off-exchange options on foreign currencies, and --

So --

As I said, Your Honor, I believe

that the holding in the American Board of Trade case on

which the court below relied in this case was dicta

Right?
MR. STUMPP:

No.

I agree, Your Honor.

I'm not

13

questioning the way the court got there.

14

could have gotten there another way, but obviously the way

15

the court did decide, they did not go on an on-

QUESTION:

MR. STUMPP:

But didn't.
-- but did not, and accordingly

3

could not overrule the decision of the prior panel and

noted the conflict with the Fourth Circuit and indicated

that that -- such a conflict was for this Court to

resolve.

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, I just wanted to be clear

that you recognized it was a holding.
MR. STUMPP:

Oh, I --my only point, Your Honor,

10

was I said I thought it could have been dicta, but clearly

11

that is not the way the court, the Second Circuit, went.

12

3

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. STUMPP:

The question, thus, is whether the

4

off-exchange foreign currency options are transactions in

5

foreign currency within the Treasury Amendment and thus

6

exempt from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act.

7

We submit that that question should be answered in the

8

affirmative for two reasons.

9

The ordinary meaning of the phrase transactions

20

in foreign currency means any commercial dealings

21

involving foreign currency or any dealings where foreign

22

currency is the subject matter of the transaction.

23

off-exchange foreign currency options that were traded are

24

dealings and they are -- and they do have foreign currency

25

as the subject matter.

Here

Accordingly, under the ordinary

1

meaning of the Treasury Amendment, they are exempt from

2

Commodity Exchange Act regulation by the Treasury

3

Amendment.

4

The second reason really confirms the first.

5

The congressional purpose in enacting the Treasury

6

Amendment was to exclude off-exchange foreign currency

7

transactions of whatever type from the Commodity Exchange

8

Act.

9

QUESTION:

Well, you say whatever type.

Now,

10

this type was not known at the time of the amendment.

11

Right?

12

,
MR. STUMPP:

That's true, Your Honor.

There was

13

not the established market there is for off-exchange

14

foreign currency markets in 1974.

15

QUESTION:

Tell me who were the traders that the

16

Treasury had in mind when it proposed this amendment.

17

take it it's the large banks I assume.

18
19

MR. STUMPP:

The majority -- the off-exchange

interbank market is primarily composed of the major banks.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. STUMPP:

22

I

All right.
And in fact the trading in this

case was done in such banks.

trading which is the subject of this case?

5

MR. STUMPP:

I'm only unclear, Your Honor, if

you're asking back in 1974 or -QUESTION:

No.

I know in '74 they couldn't

have, but today.

They're trading options the same way

7

they used to be trading futures.

MR. STUMPP:

QUESTION:

10

MR. STUMPP:

They're trading -As they're now -They are trading foreign currency

11

options now, Your Honor.

In fact, I believe from the

12

amici briefs that were submitted by the banks and the

13

industry associations, it indicates the hundreds of

14

billions of dollars that are trade in that market on a --

15
16

QUESTION:

So that if the concern at the time

17

the amendment was originally proposed was to keep this

18

business within the United States, or keeps the -- keep

19

the American banks competitive, that concern of policy I

20

presume then would be just as applicable to options

21

trading today as it was for future tradings then.

22

MR. STUMPP:

I think that's precisely correct,

23

Your Honor.

I would also note that although the primary

24

perhaps concern with the Treasury Amendment related to the

25

large banks, that was not the only concern.

Department noted that it was also to affect the traders

2

and investors that were dealing in this off-exchange

3

market.

4

traders were the major banks, but they are not the only

5

traders who are dealing in this market either then or now.

So, I will not deny that the majority of the

6

If -- as I understood your answer to

7

Justice Souter, there were very few traders other than the

8

large banks in options in foreign currency.

How about

Again, Your Honor, are we speaking

then or now?

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. STUMPP:

Then.
I don't know what traders existed

14

back in '74 in the Government securities market.

15

certainly assume that the major banks were trading there.

16

The Treasury Department in its letter spoke generally of

17

this off-exchange market referring to banks, referring to

investors.

apply also to options in Government securities.

And

there's a suggestion in some of the briefs that accepting
3

your position would lead to a substantial regulatory gap.

4

So, just during the course of your remarks, I hope you

5

could address that.

6

MR. STUMPP:

7

The second meaning that I -- or the second

8

reason I was suggesting the question should be answer in

the affirmative was the congressional purpose in enacting

this to exclude the entire off-exchange market from

regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act.

12

been suggested by the -- some of the questions today, that

13

unless that decision is reversed and foreign currency

14

options are held to be excluded by the Treasury Amendment,

15

the congressional purpose in enacting it would be defeated

16

and the vast majority of foreign currency options may move

17

to banks and institutions without the United States.

And as has

Now, to provide just a brief description of

19

petitioners' activities in this case, petitioner Dunn was

20

the President of petitioner Delta Consultants which served

21

as an advisor concerning foreign currency transactions to

22

various investment companies.

23

However, the foreign currency options that were

24

transacted were not traded with investors and they were

25

not traded on a board of trade.

Instead, the transactions

Lyonnais, Bank Julius Baer, Societe Generale, and Chase,

and are different from the foreign currency futures

5

contracts that are traded on exchanges and which the CFTC

does regulate.

7

The district court rejected the argument that

8

the Treasury Amendment provided an exclusion for these

9

off-exchange foreign currency options and therefore there

10

was no subject matter jurisdiction.

11

affirmed but did not independently analyze the Treasury

Amendment exclusion.

We submit the decision should be reversed.

We have that kind of difference in

Why shouldn't it apply here?
MR. STUMPP:

Because there is no indication of

14

any congressional purpose to indicate such a distinction.

15

I think that the argument being made by respondents is

16

that Congress selected the word in to draw a rather

17

critical regulatory distinction, and I don't think there's

18

any indication that that was the intent of Congress to do

so.

drafted as transactions in foreign currency futures as

opposed to leaving the broad description of transactions

MR. STUMPP:

Why one would wish to distinguish

I don't think that there would be a

reason in light of the legislative intent indicated in

enacting the statute.

9

amendments were being proposed and the definition of

The Treasury Department letter

10

11

traditional agricultural commodities, the Treasury

12

Department was concerned that that language might include

13

foreign currency transactions and communicated that

14

concern to Congress.
Most of the specific discussion contained in the

already been commented on, in 1974 there was not an

2

established market for off-exchange foreign currency

3

options.

4

that without such a market Congress intentionally chose

5

the word in to distinguish futures from an options market

6

which did not yet exist to any real extent.

Thus, it really doesn't make sense to suggest

7

So, accordingly, I think the ordinary meaning

8

and the most logical meaning, which is confirmed by the

9

congressional purpose, is that transactions in foreign

10

currency was a broad exclusion to this new expansion of

11

the definition of commodity under the CEA and accordingly

12

should be given that effect by this Court, namely, to

13

exclude the entire field of off-exchange foreign currency

14

transactions, whether those transactions happen to be in

15

the nature of futures, options, or any other type of

16

transaction that there may be.

17

QUESTION:

Because we're going to have to draw

18

the distinction with respect to the sort of recapture

19

proviso at the end, aren't we, because that refers to

20

sales for future delivery?

the futures contracts, but it's not going to draw back the

language of the statute which involve the sale thereof for

QUESTION:

5

But sale for future delivery is a

6

fairly straightforward description, isn't it, of the

future versus the options contract?
MR. STUMPP:

I would say, Your Honor, that the

description of sale for future delivery would include both

that no person shall offer to enter into or enter the

that nothing in this chapter is deemed to govern or be

applicable to any transaction in an option on foreign

2

There are other provisions.

Section 2(i) of the

3

Commodity Exchange Act also gives regulation authority to

4

the CFTC over options.

5

But again, those are options -- regulation

6

generally resides in the CFTC which is not disputed.

7

However, if the option is in foreign currency, if it is a

8

transaction in foreign currency, the Treasury Amendment

9

pulls it out, exempts it from the Commodity Exchange Act,

10

whether it be under section 6c(b), section 2(i), or any

11

other section.

12

from regulation under the act.

13

The Treasury Amendment would exclude them

4

The language selected by Congress as proposed by

the Treasury Department which wished to exclude CFTC

The

the exclusion that the Treasury Amendment provided for

those transactions in foreign currency whether they happen

14

I would also note that, and getting back to one

15

of the prior points in terms of delivery as a future

16

compared to an option, is that the CFTC respondents argue

17

that options only create a right rather than an obligation

18

to purchase or sell the commodity.

19

distinction is really inaccurate because it doesn't

properly describe a future itself.

have been determinations that futures -- instruments can

MR. STUMPP:

1

Speaking here, Your Honor, I don't

2

think there is any regulatory gap because even the CFTC's

3

complaint describes the investments that were entered into

4

here as investment strategies, and I think that would fall

5

within the definition of investment contracts for SEC

6

jurisdictional purposes.

7

So, I don't think there is any regulatory gap.

8

I think there is no jurisdiction of the CFTC over these

9

transactions, but it is not to suggest that there is not

10

jurisdiction of other agencies, most appropriately the

11

SEC, to regulate those type of transactions.
As I said, the transactions were not made

12

13

between petitioners and the individual investors.

transactions were made between -- with the major banks.

That might be a good idea.

QUESTION:

That or don't say anything important.

(Laughter.)
MR. MINEAR:

I would much prefer to speak to the

important matters here.
And in that regard, I think the provisions -these two provisions that I've cited are important and
very significant because they both mention -- they discuss
options and they both describe them as transactions
involving the commodity, and they both use very specific
language to talk about options.
I think what's clear throughout the CEA is that
when Congress meant to deal with options, it dealt with
them quite specifically.

It either mentioned them by name

or it used the transactions involving terminology.

That

same language is found also in section 2(a) of the CEA.
And we think that that is very significant in
determining what Congress meant when it used the more
restrictive phrase transactions in foreign currency.
QUESTION:

To go back to Justice Scalia's

question for a minute -MR. MINEAR:

reason why, in a world where options transactions now

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

the world is such that the purpose is the same and the

meant.
MR. MINEAR:

12

Yes, we think there is a very good

reason --

QUESTION:

14

MR. MINEAR:

What is that?
-- that they should be treated

Isn't it true also, or is it -- it's

QUESTION:

We'll vest that

Mr. Minear, don't futures and options

involve the same market participants?

I'm not sure the

And if you

11

if they're the same participants and it's the same general

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I think all of these can

raise very complex economic questions in terms of the

envisioning the possibility that repurchase agreements

Repurchase --

A repurchase

previously issued security.

Yes, although this more often takes

They can take place between the

QUESTION:

14

Mr. Minear, if we should disagree

with you and hold that options are included within the

exemption, do you think the language at the end of that

Treasury Amendment, unless such transactions involve the

see that if you look directly below at section 5 which

says transactions -- this is the legislative finding

We think that's a term of art that

6

QUESTION:

And that was added in 1983.

7

MR. MINEAR:

8

Now, I would like to reemphasize a point here

That was added in 1983.

9

that I think is very important to bear in mind, and that

10

is the Treasury Amendment is an exemption from a general

11

regulatory program, and if there are doubts about its

12

reach, we think the more narrow interpretation is the

13

preferred one here.

14

That rule has particular force where Congress

15

has appointed an expert agency, namely, the CFTC to -- and

16

given it authority to provide further exemptions from the

17

regulatory program.

18

in this area and can make those determinations of whether

19

or not the transactions at issue pose the threat of fraud

20

that was the underlying concern of the securities -- the

21

Commodity Exchange Act when it was enacted in 1936 and

22

when it was expanded in 1974.

23

It's the CFTC that has the expertise

We think that petitioners' non-textual argument

24

really is ultimately unpersuasive.

25

that it would be illogical for Congress to exempt both

Their notion is simply

1

foreign currency futures and foreign currency options

2

because they serve similar marketing and hedging

3

functions.

4

But ultimately Congress has always recognized

5

the difference between futures and options.

6

so in the agricultural commodities, and we believe it has

7

done so in these other commodities as well.

8

Congress has drawn a line here, and it has drawn a line

9

between foreign currency futures and options.

It has done

We think

It had a

10

reasonable and sound basis for drawing that line, namely,

11

the fact that options pose more serious risks of fraud.

12

Finally, the last point I would like to make is

3

although we believe that the statutory language here is

4

clear, if you disagree with us on that, then it's

5

appropriate to give deference to the CFTC's view as the

6

administrative agency that is administering the statute.

7

QUESTION:

But that would be a matter of the

8

agency's jurisdiction, wouldn't it?

9

give deference on the jurisdictional point.
I think that you do in fact.

In

21

fact, in CFTC v. Schor, this Court made that point.

It

22

was a question whether CFTC had jurisdiction over

23

reparation proceedings, but you did recognize that we do

24

-- it's almost inevitable -- inevitably necessary to give

25

deference to an agency's determination.

Yes, but that isn't a rule in thin

That's the rule of what Congress would have liked

4

MR. MINEAR:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
And if anything here where it's the

6

Treasury Amendment, why wouldn't you think Congress would

7

like the courts to pay particular attention to the

8

Treasury, if anyone?

9

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we think that the Court's

10

explanation of deference in Smiley is that Congress has

11

delegated this authority to the agency that's charged with

12

administration of the statute.

13

QUESTION:

But on this point, hasn't the

14

Government taken different positions at times and said

15

that both futures and options in foreign currency were

16

excluded from CFTC jurisdiction?

17

the Government has taken at times in the past.

The point that continues to be made concerning

17

that options have been dealt with differently by the CFTC.

18

As I said it is not relevant once you -- once the CFTC

19

acknowledges, as they have, that the foreign currency

20

options market didn't exist at that time and the

21

agricultural options regulation, whatever purpose may have

22

been served specifically dealing with agricultural

options, would not be relevant to the expansion of the

definition of commodity in the '74 amendments beyond the

traditional agricultural commodities.
