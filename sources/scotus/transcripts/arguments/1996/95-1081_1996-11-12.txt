ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. SALLOUM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. SALLOUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the opinion and judgment of the Fifth Circuit

14

in this case is allowed to stand, it would defeat the

15

purpose that Congress enacted section 33(g) of the

16

Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which

17

was to protect an employer from increased compensation

18

liability when a worker, or those claiming through him,

19

settle a third party case for less than the compensation

20

they would be entitled under the Longshore Act.

21

It would also defeat the purpose for which

22

Congress passed section 33(f) of the Longshore Act which

23

is the give an employer credit to the extent of net third

24

party recoveries received by a worker or those claiming

25

through him.

1

The facts of this case are that Jefferson Yates,

2

between 1953 and 1967, worked as a ship fitter for Ingalls

3

Shipyard.

4

land-based jobs for other employers.

5

He left Ingalls in 1967 and worked several

14 years after he left Ingalls, he was diagnosed

6

with asbestosis in March of 1981.

7

filed a claim against Ingalls for compensation and medical

8

benefits under the Longshore Act.

9

In April of 1981, he

In May of 1981, his lawyers, who are the same

10

lawyers that represent him in the compensation claim

11

against Ingalls, filed a products liability suit in

12

Federal court in Biloxi, Mississippi, seeking $6 million

13

in actual and punitive damages against 23 asbestos

14

manufacturers who he claimed made the asbestos to which he

15

was exposed at Ingalls.

16

Less than a year after his compensation claim

17

was filed against Ingalls, Ingalls wrote the district

18

director for the Sixth Compensation District and accepted

19

his claim, voluntarily accepted his claim, under the

20

Longshore Act and agreed to pay him medical benefits and

21

tendered to him all benefits under the Longshore Act.

Mr. Salloum, may I get you to

Salloum, may I get you to clarify for me how the employer

25

is injured here?

1

suit against those third parties who were at fault for the

2

employee's injuries to recover payments that you -- the

3

employer made -- may have made.

4

MR. SALLOUM:

If a Burnside action was filed

5

separate and apart from the Longshore Act, the employer

6

would be faced -- if the employer sued the 23 asbestos

7

manufacturers directly, the employer would be faced with

8

certain common law defenses in the Burnside tort action,

9

tort indemnity action, that the employer would not be

10

faced in a direct action by the worker against those

11

defendants under the Longshore Act.

12

For example, if the employer filed a direct suit

13

outside the Longshore Act under the Burnside tort

14

indemnity theory, the defendants, the asbestos

15

manufacturers, could assert certain contributory

16

negligence features of coworkers of Mr. Yates which would

17

serve to reduce Ingalls' recovery against those asbestos

18

manufacturers.

19

More important than that - - and this Court made

20

it clear in Bloomer -- that an employer is entitled to

21

receive back 100 percent of his compensation and medical

22

benefits plus its attorney's fees.

23

Congress under section 933 of the Longshore Act.

24
25

That's provided by

wrongful act of a worker, to file a separate Burnside tort

1

indemnity lawsuit, the employer, in addition to being

2

faced with common law defenses which would reduce its

3

recovery in the Burnside action, would also be faced with

4

having to bear its own attorney's fees and cost in the

5

Burnside action which Congress has made it clear in

6

section 933(e), as interpreted by this Court in Bloomer,

7

that the employer has its inviolate right to have 100

8

percent of its compensation and medical benefits --

QUESTION:

So, you say you might not be made

whole or as whole as you would be otherwise.
How about recovering monies that you pay to Mrs.
Yates out of the post-death settlements?
QUESTION:

Yes, ma'am.

Your Honor, Ingalls

14

approved the post-death settlements.

15

classic example of that and why section 933(g) and section

16

933(f) are so important is that after Ingalls accepted Mr.

17

Yates' claim in June of 1992 and agreed to pay him

18

lifetime benefits under the Longshore Act, Mr. Yates and

19

Mrs. Yates between 1982, when Ingalls accepted the claim,

20

and 1986 when he died, entered into four settlements with

21

asbestos manufacturers in that third party case which Mrs.

22

Yates released her wrongful death claims for Mr. Yates

23

during his lifetime.

24
25

And I think the

A classic example of that is that those four
settlements that were entered into between the time

1

Ingalls accepted the claim and the time Mr. Yates died

2

where she released her wrongful death claims totaled

3

$30,000, which were much less --

4
5

QUESTION:

And that money is not recoverable by

the employer.
MR. SALLOUM:

6

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

7

-- that's exactly right, Your Honor, but the comparison

8

that I'm making -- and the reason why Congress felt it so
important for an employer to have a right to consent to a

10

third party settlement is that after Mr. Yates died, Mrs.

11

Yates and her adult children - - the next three settlements

12

that they entered into after Mr. Yates died were for

13

$105,000.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you know, what you're basically

15

saying is that the rule should kick in once the employer

16

starts making payments, but that's not -- it's not

17

consistent with our holding in Estate of Cowart which said

18

a person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right

1

and thus becomes a person entitled to compensation at the

20

moment the right to recovery is vested,

21

time of the injury.

22

23
24
25

MR. SALLOUM:

Your Honor,

that is, at the

that's exactly what

we're saying.
QUESTION:

But I think we've kind of decided

Cowart and relatively recently.

Are you asking us to

reverse that?
MR. SALLOUM:

2

No, I'm not, Your Honor.

3

asking this Court to follow Cowart.

4

to find --

5

QUESTION:

I'm

I'm asking this Court

Well, I would think if we followed

6

Cowart, we would have to say that Mrs. Yates was not

7

entitled or qualified for a benefit until her husband's

8

death.

9

MR. SALLOUM:

That I think, Your Honor, is a

10

source of confusion for the Fifth Circuit.

11

Court, as I understand Cowart, said was the right of Mr.

12

Cowart to recover compensation arose at the time of his

13

injury, not at the time that the employer acknowledged

14

liability under the act and not at the time that he was

15

found entitled to adjudication under the act.

16

found in Cowart, as I understand Cowart, that his right to

17

recover compensation arose when his injury arose.

18

What this

This Court

And we are simply saying that that principle

19

should hold true for those claiming through Mr. Cowart,

20

that the right of the worker and the right of those

21

claiming through the worker arising -- arises at the time

22

of the worker's injury.

23

QUESTION:

But do you think that Cowart would

24

make Mrs. Yates a person entitled to compensation as soon

25

as he knew he had been exposed to asbestos?

MR. SALLOUM:

QUESTION:

I am, Your Honor.

Because they might divorce.

3

might predecease him.

4

with Cowart, but you think it is.

5

MR. SALLOUM:

She

I didn't think that was consistent

I think it's very consistent with

6

Cowart, Your Honor.

I think what's -- what the argument

7

that the Director has posed in the courts below and I

8

think the source of confusion is to take the vesting
language out of Cowart, take it in vacuo, and ignore this

10

Court's holding that Mr. Cowart became a person entitled

11

to compensation at the time of his injury.

12

The fact that a wife of a worker may divorce,

13

the fact that a wife of a worker may die before her

14

husband becomes an irrelevant fact, if that happens,

15

insofar as the employer is concerned because if the wife

16

divorces or if the wife predeceases the husband, then her

17

unapproved third party settlements for less than a

18

compensation she would be entitled against the employer

1

would not prejudice the employer because she would not

20

have a claim against that employer.

21

But the fact of the matter here is that Mrs.

22

Yates entered into these unauthorized third party

23

settlements.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but the question that -- I'm

still not sure I understand your answer because the

1

question is, when did she become a person entitled to

2

compensation?

3

MR. SALLOUM:

Your Honor, she became a person

4

entitled to compensation at the same time that her husband

5

became a person entitled to compensation.

6

QUESTION:

Even if the next day she died.

7

MR. SALLOUM:

Yes, Your Honor, because the

8

prejudice to the employer would not be there if she died.

9

She would not have the death claim against the employer.

10

Her third party - QUESTION:

11

She would -- there would be no

12

prejudice to the employer unless she later became a person

13

entitled to compensation.

14

MR. SALLOUM:

No, sir.

There would be no

15

prejudice to the employer until she claimed compensation

16

by virtue of the occupational disease to her husband.

17

became a person entitled to compensation at the same time

18

as her husband when he was diagnosed with an occupational

19

disease.

20

QUESTION:

She

No, but supposing she did get a

21

settlement of her contingent claim later on and then she

22

died before he did but she had that money, you know,

23

tucked away.

24

Would the employer be prejudiced at all in that

25

circumstance?

She got a settlement with the third party.

QUESTION:

You sound like you're arguing the

dissent in Cowart.
MR. SALLOUM:

No, Your Honor.

I'm arguing the

majority opinion in Cowart and that is -QUESTION:

It's a very plain language,

strictly

literal interpretation.
MR. SALLOUM:

That is the plain language.

The

15

plain language that was -- I believe the Court was

16

referring to in Cowart was not the phrase, person entitled

17

to compensation.

18

referring to in Cowart, as I understand Cowart, was the

19

1984 amendments where they -- where Congress added the

20

language that if you don't - - if a worker does not receive

21

an employer's consent to a third party settlement, then he

22

is bound by the forfeiture provisions of 33(g)

23

of whether or not the employer has paid compensation or

24

whether or not the employer has acknowledged liability.

25

The plain language that the Court was

1

was again a person entitled to compensation.
MR. SALLOUM:

2

That operative clause I believe

3

was considered by this Court in the context of the

4

addition by Congress in 1984 that they are barred

5

regardless of whether the employer makes the payments or

6

acknowledges liability.

9

QUESTION:

Let me ask you something about the

Burnside action or actions like that.

If the employer --

if there's a settlement with a third party, and the

10

employer then sues the third party, does the employer have

11

a cause of action on the grounds that the settlement was

12

somehow inadequate, or is it it just seeks indemnity based

13

on the fault of the --

14

MR. SALLOUM:

15

strictly based on tort indemnity.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

Your Honor, I believe it would be

And that's a State law cause of

action?
MR. SALLOUM:

It's a State law cause of action,

Your Honor.

Burnside to be a tort indemnity.

21

It's been recognized by the Federal courts in

QUESTION:

In other words, the third party has

22

no duty to make an adequate settlement, no duty that runs

23

to the employer?

24
25

It's just a strict indemnity.

MR. SALLOUM:

That's correct, as I understand

it, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

That's correct,

Mr. Salloum, I'll ask what may be an

20

embarrassing question but it goes to the reason that I'm

21

not following your argument.

22

You say that the -- in effect, for purposes of

23

the statute, the wife becomes entitled or the spouse

24

becomes entitled at the same time as the injured party,

25

and you say that's the moment of injury.

I thought the

1

distinctiori was that, in essence, the claim of the

2

immediately injured party arises because the injury is

3

physical, whereas the claim of the spouse arises later

4

because the injury is economic and it does not occur until

5

the support or the right to support is eliminated in this

6

case by the death.

7

of the spousal claim here?
MR. SALLOUM:

8

9

Am I -- do I misunderstand the nature

Your Honor, I believe you're

absolutely right on the nature of the spousal claim, but I

10

believe that you will see under the Longshore Act that a

11

claim for disability by a worker is purely economic.

12

can have an occupational disease that's progressive in

13

nature and continue to work where that disease does not -

He

14
15

QUESTION:

I see.

So, you're saying if one

16

economic injury arises at the moment of physical injury,

17

the other one does too.

18

MR. SALLOUM:

That's correct, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SALLOUM:

21

And the Ninth Circuit in Cretan found just that.

22

They recognized that the phrase, quote, person entitled to

23

compensation, was not defined by Congress in the Longshore

24

Act.

25

was capable of several different interpretations, but the

I see.
That's correct.

They recognized that person entitled to compensation

1

interpretation that the courts must give to the phrase is

2

in the context of the reason that the statute is there in

3

the first place.

4

QUESTION:

All right.

With that in mind, what

5

if -- taking the earlier example in which the spouse dies

6

or is divorced before the injured party's date -- the

7

primary injured party's date of death, if the injured

8

party marries again, does the new spouse have any claim

9

following death?
MR. SALLOUM:

10

No, Your Honor, and that's a very

11

important point.

12

both the worker and those claiming through the worker

13

arises at the time of his injury.

14
15

That's why we say that the rights of

What's your authority for that

answer?

MR. SALLOUM:

It's section -- it's the

17

dependency provision of the Longshore Act that says that

18

it's only the dependents of the worker at the time of his

19

injury --

20

QUESTION:

At the time.

21

MR. SALLOUM:

-- that are entitled to recover

22

under the Longshore Act.

And that's why the Longshore Act

23

is all based on the -- all rights of the injured worker

24

and his family, as well as all liabilities of the

25

employer, begin at the moment of the injury not when he's

-- the worker is adjudicated entitled to compensation and

2

not when he dies before his wife.

3

states that the worker's rights and his average weekly-

4

wage upon which his compensation is based occurs at the

5

time of his injury.

6

The Longshore Act

It says that all questions of dependency, that

7

is, those who are ultimately entitled to recover under the

8

Longshore Act in the event the worker dies from an

9

employment-related problem -- those rights of dependencies

10

are determined at the time of his injury not at the time

11

of his death.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

But they have to be dependent at both

times, don't they?
MR. SALLOUM:

That's correct.

That's correct.

They have to be primarily -- well, solely.

example, if he divorced his existing wife at the time of

the injury and then remarried immediately prior to his

death, that wife, that surviving wife, would not be

a case involving the word employee in which the Government

2

was arguing that the word employee sometimes in the

3

statute can mean current employees and sometimes can mean

4

current or past employees.

5

Now, why can't that principle be applied here,

6

that in some provisions here, the person entitled to such

7

compensation means the worker who was injured, but in

8

other provisions where it makes eminent sense, it can mean

9

him or a person who will later be entitled to

10

compensation, not the person now, but the one who may

11

later be entitled to it?

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we believe

13

that in this particular case, when you look at the

14

structure of 33(g), there are many reasons why this cannot

15

be interpreted to someone who has a potential entitlement.

16

First of all, there are many prerequisites that

17

Mrs. Yates would have to meet in order to become eligible.

18

And I think this is what Justice Stevens was getting at.

19

This is one of the reasons that a person who's actually

20

entitled to compensation is in a very different situation

21

than Mrs. Yates for example.

22

whether or not she would be entitled, not only would her

23

husband have to die, she would have to outlive him, they

would still have to be married at that time, and his death

would have to be caused by the work-related injury.

In fact, when you

project out a -- what a person entitled to - - what a

person would be entitled to under the act, you can project

9

out on an actuarial table the life expectancy of the

worker, but for someone not yet entitled, you would also

have to find some way to project the likelihood of the

employee's death resulting from the work-related injury,

Ms. Brinkmann, if we said, or may be

If we -- if the words meant person now or in the future,

out in the colloquy, you must be a dependent at the time

I'd have to say

7

no, and I really want to correct I think a premise that

was underlined in the earlier argument.

9

The worker's right to entitlement is based on

10

disability, not injury.

11

that is not a person entitled to compensation.

Let me ask you a very simpleminded

8

question.

It was one that was brought up in the brief on

the other side, and that is, if you try to envision what

Congress was doing here, why would Congress want to say to

11

the widow or the potential widow who settles shortly

before the death, you can, in effect, recover twice, but

13

to the one who settles after the husband dies, you can

recover only once?

scheme?

16

What rationality is there to such a

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that it would be

17

reasonable for Congress to have distinguished between

18

someone who already has a vested right to compensation, a

19

known alternative remedy, vis-a-vis a person who only has

20

a potential, perhaps entitlement at a later point in time.

21

And weighing that against an employer in the first

22

situation which also has a vested liability and a vested

23

lien and entitlement to recoup, giving that employer a

24

right to prevent a settlement or to participate in that

25

settlement, as opposed to in the latter situation where

1

the employer has no liability nor lien at that point in

2

time.

3

And we also think again because of the very

4

different nature of the determinations of what

5

compensation the person would be entitled to under the

6

act, in the one instance, when the person is entitled,

7

it's a reasonably, generally knowable calculation that may

involve actuarial tables, but in the other situation, it

9

involves much more than actuarial tables, a lot of

eventualities about outliving another person that --

11

expectancy of the duration of a marriage.

12

If I could, Your Honor, I'd like to turn to the

13

second question presented, whether or not the Director is

14

entitled to participate as a party respondent in a court

15

of appeals.

16

We believe that the Director is entitled to

1

No approval was required, and it's

2

right there in the petitioners' appendix to the petition

for certiorari, pages 49 and 48 and 62 and 63, is because

There was a section 8(i) settlement in May, May

MR. CLARK:

I believe the shorthand answer to

obtain a prior written consent from the employer and

MR. SALLOUM:

Your Honor, that's the first thing

3

I was going to address.

4

The act provides that it's the wife of the worker at the

5

time of his injury that is entitled to compensation at his

6

death.

7

if he changed wives at the time - - before the time of his

8

death, that wife that married the worker after his injury

9

would not be entitled to compensation.

I don't believe that's correct.

If he was not married at the time of his injury or

Only the wife

10

married to him at the time of the injury would be entitled

11

to compensation.

12

If the Court holds, as the Government and as the

13

respondents want the Court to hold, it would mean that no

14

employer would be entitled to any credit for any third

party recoveries made by a wife when she releases her

wrongful death claims during the lifetime of her husband.

We think it's very important to call to the
