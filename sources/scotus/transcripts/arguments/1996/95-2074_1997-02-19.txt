ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARCI A. HAMILTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HAMILTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is not about religious liberty.

This

14

case is about Federal power.

It is about the ability of

15

the United States Constitution to restrain Congress, the

16

branch most likely to be controlled by interest groups and

17

by opinion polls, from engaging in a hostile takeover of

18

the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

19

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was

20

passed in an emotional and heated response to this Court's

21

determination in Employment Division v. Smith, is a brazen

22

attempt to reinterpret the Free Exercise Clause and to

23

impose that reinterpretation on the courts, on the States,

24

and to shift the balance of power between church and State

25

dramatically in favor of the churches.

1

This is the worst of legislative overreaching,

2

which violates the fundamental structural constitutional

3

guarantees, the separation of powers, Federalism, and

4

separation between church and State.

5

The constitutional bedrock was laid long ago in

6

Marbury v. Madison, where this Court rejected explicitly

7

the notion that the legislature may alter the Constitution

8

by an ordinary act.

9

either superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary

The Constitution, this Court said, is

10

means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislation, like

11

other acts, and is alterable --

12

QUESTION:

Ms. Hamilton --

13

MS. HAMILTON:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

-- certainly you have to come to

15

grips with the fact that, in situations such as the Voting

16

Rights Act, where this Court had said the meaning of the

17

Constitution was that intentional discrimination violates

18

it but had never applied the so-called effects test, yet

19

Congress passed laws of a prophylactic nature saying that

20

discriminatory effects would be sufficient to create a

21

cause of action for discrimination, and we upheld those.

22

MS. HAMILTON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

And there are other similar

24

prophylactic measures, and how do you distinguish those

25

from what Congress now offers in amicus briefing, a

1

2

rationale that it is a prophylactic measure?
MS. HAMILTON:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

3

the test to understand whether or not section 5 has been

4

appropriately used by Congress is the text of the

5

amendment itself.

6

power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions

7

of this article.

8

The provisions of this article means, constitutional

9

guarantees.

10

It states, the Congress shall have

Enforce means, to compel obedience to.

Every case in which this Court has upheld

11

prophylactic measures fits that formulation.

12

the enforcement, the compelling of obedience to

13

constitutional guarantees.

14

QUESTION:

It has been

The religious --

Well, Katzenbach v. Morgan I think

15

went further than that.

I mean, it said that even though

16

Lassiter had said that literacy tests were okay, now

17

literacy tests were not okay in New York for Puerto Ricans

18

because of what Congress had said.

19

MS. HAMILTON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, Lassiter

20

stated that as a facial matter a particular literacy test

21

was not unconstitutional.

22

a factual determination that as they looked out over

23

literacy tests they came to the conclusion that they were

24

almost always evidence of invidious discrimination, and on

25

the basis of that factual determination the Court in

The Congress went back and made

1

Katzenbach v. Morgan upheld Congress' decision to ban

2

literacy tests.

3

It is the difference between the fact-finding

4

capacities of the legislature and this Court's ability to

5

be the final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

6

Well, it's kind of unsatisfactory,

7

really, to think that all you'd get from your argument is

8

at best a notion that we would say Congress had to do a

9

better job of making facts, a factual determination here,

10

and that's kind of an uncomfortable position to be in.
I'm not sure -- I mean, they can always go back

11
12

and build a bigger record.

13

looking at, anecdotal events, where they thought courts in

14

general were not giving sufficient attention to laws by

15

States and others that might impinge on the Free Exercise

16

Clause.

17

MS. HAMILTON:

They had something they were

Well, Justice O'Connor, the

18

difference between the Religious Freedom Restoration Act

19

and all of this Court's section 5 jurisprudence will turn

20

on the meaning of the word appropriate legislation, which

21

section 5 says.

22

fit between the means and the end to be appropriate.

23

There must be some kind of proportional

QUESTION:

Well, given that, could we go back to

24

Justice O'Connor's original question, which I think was,

25

in effect, why isn't there an obvious analogy between the

1

situation in the Voting Rights Act, section 2, section 5,

2

and the case that we have before us?
Why -- assuming that the voting rights cases

3
4

were correctly decided, why doesn't this case follow them?
MS. HAMILTON:

5

Because Congress in the Religious

6

Freedom Restoration Act was not aiming to ensure

7

constitutional guarantees under the Free Exercise Clause.

8

The purpose, patent on its face and ripe in the

9

legislative history, was to bring into high level of

10

scrutiny that conduct which was constitutionally

11

appropriate.
QUESTION:

12

So basically it was the candor of

13

Congress which is going to result in the

14

unconstitutionality of this statute in your view?

15

MS. HAMILTON:

16

but rather the patent purpose --

17
18

QUESTION:

Not the candor, Justice Souter,

Well, candor in expressing the

purpose.

19

In other words, I take it, then, your argument

20

would be different if Congress had simply kept its cards

21

closer to its vest and had said, we know that under Smith

22

there is a certain standard but, in fact, to guard against

23

violations that would escape that standard we are going to

24

have a slightly different test.

25

okay.

That would have been

MS. HAMILTON:

1
2

That still would not pass this

Court's section 5 jurisprudence.
In the civil rights cases, this Court made clear

3
4

there must be some colorable evidence of some State

5

wrongdoing that justifies prophylactic activity.

6

no evidence in this record to that effect.
QUESTION:

7

So it's timing, then.

There is

Congress might

8

do this later on if it could point to specific instances

9

in which, under Smith, something had passed muster, and

10

yet later on it was determined that there really had been

11

a motive to discriminate against religion.

12

MS. HAMILTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, presumably --

They jumped the gun.

Is that

basically it?

15

MS. HAMILTON:

Well, presumably, if Congress did

16

find specific instances -- for example, there was a set of

17

laws that almost always meant there was discrimination

18

against a particular religion -- in that particular

19

circumstance, Congress would be acting the way they were

20

acting under the Voting Rights Act cases.
QUESTION:

21

Okay.

So basically I guess it does

22

boil down to the fact that the reason there is not an

23

analogy between the voting cases and this one is a factual

24

record.

25

Congress did not have a factual record.
MS. HAMILTON:

Is --

Well, in addition, it would have

been impossible to have gotten a factual record with

2

respect to every law in the United States, whether

3

passed --

4

QUESTION:

Well, does Congress -- I assume --

5

I -- and that may be so, but I take it your argument is

6

that Congress in effect has to wait.

7

against what it foresees as a difficulty by legislating in

8

advance under section 5.

9

been a proven record of violation for which the standard

10

It cannot guard

It's got to wait until there has

of this Court is insufficient to guard.

11

MS. HAMILTON:

12

QUESTION:

Is that it?

Yes, Justice --

To put a finer point on it, let me

13

ask you this.

14

rights laws, they in effect made a presumption that where

15

there's been a discriminatory effect by a certain law they

16

must -- that that bears on intent, and it's likely there

17

was a discriminatory intent.

18

When Congress passed some of the voting

Suppose what Congress did here was to prohibit

19

any law that disproportionately affects religious

20

minorities.

21

MS. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

25

If Congress --

Or religion.

Could they have done

that?
MS. HAMILTON:

If Congress had evidence that

there were instances where there was discrimination in a

1

particular arena with respect to particular types of

2

religions, Congress certainly could go ahead and do what

3

you're describing, which is -QUESTION:

4

It could pass a law that says some

5

State law, for example, that disproportionately affects a

6

religious group would be subject to stricter scrutiny?

7
8

MS. HAMILTON:

11

QUESTION:

But you think that's not what was

done?
MS. HAMILTON:

That is not what was done here.

12

The point here was to eviscerate any proof of

13

discrimination of any kind.

14

It's --

that's certainly not RFRA.

9
10

I think that's possible.

QUESTION:

Ms. Hamilton, in your brief you say

15

that the Court should lay to rest the substantive power

16

theory, i.e. the notion that Congress may expand the scope

17

of constitutional guarantees.

18

opt for a very narrow reading of the opinion in

19

Katzenbach.

20
21

MS. HAMILTON:

QUESTION:

23

MS. HAMILTON:

25

I -- Katzenbach actually

had two implicit readings.

22

24

Yes.

I take it you would then

Yes.
I would hold it to the much

narrower holding of the fact-finding capacity of Congress.
QUESTION:

Ms. Hamilton, when Congress wrote

1

this provision that's central here -- Congress shall have

2

power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions

3

of this article -- and when that was ratified by the

4

States, was it understood that the provisions of this

5

article included the First Amendment?
I mean, it was clearly understood that it

6

7

included the Equal Protection Clause, which was at issue

8

in the civil rights cases.

9

MS. HAMILTON:

It's not at all clear in the

10

legislative history.

11

Amendment's only included at this point under the

12

Fourteenth Amendment by judicial incorporation.

QUESTION:

We do know that the First

Which is a development of this

century.

15

MS. HAMILTON:

16

QUESTION:

17

And, indeed, of the latter two-thirds

of this century, isn't it?

18

MS. HAMILTON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Right.

There's no --

Well, why isn't that the argument

you're making, then, that -MS. HAMILTON:

22

in the opening brief.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MS. HAMILTON:

25

Right.

Oh, we do make that in a footnote
There are so many things to say --

-- about RFRA that it's hard to

find which one is the most appropriate.

1

QUESTION:

Yes, but certainly that's a major

2

point, that when Congress has adopted a provision which

3

it -- or has proposed for a constitutional amendment a

4

provision that enables Congress to prevent the unequal

5

treatment of any citizen, but especially of blacks, which

6

is what was at issue at the -- to convert that into the

7

power of Congress to enforce any provision of the Bill of

8

Rights, isn't that a massive alteration of the original

9

meaning of it?

10

MS. HAMILTON:

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

14
15

It's staggering.

Ms. Hamilton --

Ms. Hamilton, the historical record

is not all one way on that point, isn't that so?
MS. HAMILTON:

No.

One of the problems with the

16

history of the Fourteenth Amendment, I'm sorry to say, is

17

that John Bingham did say several things that contradicted

18

himself several times, but I think it's clear that if you

19

look at the discussions of the history of the Fourteenth

20

Amendment regarding religion, the concerns about religion

21

were not religious liberty per se, they were concerns

22

about discrimination against particular groups on the

23

basis of religion, so the notion that religious liberty

24

per se is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and now

25

there's broad expansive power to enforce, that's certainly

not in the legis --

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. HAMILTON:

4
5

Why is --- in the history of the

Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Why is it staggering, even under a

6

pre-Fourteenth Amendment view -- I mean, sorry, the

7

ancient view that was being described.

8

9

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

Why, even under that view, is it a

10

staggering thing to say, well, there's certainly some

11

protection in due process liberty of people's religious

12

freedom, and Congress finds that when you have laws that

13

significantly affect that freedom, they should be looked

14

at very closely to make certain there's good reason for

15

not making an exception.

16

I mean, if you just heard it just like that,

17

you'd think that's a -- not an unreasonable or a

18

staggering thing to say as a way of enforcing the

19

protection that was originally in that word liberty,

20

whether then or now.

21

MS. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

And why is it such an odd thing that

23

we should look to the -- scrutinize the evidentiary

24

records of --

25

MS. HAMILTON:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think the

(800) FOR DEPO

1

point that Justice Scalia was leading me to with the --

2

and I was able to get in staggering was that the question

3

of the definition of appropriate, how far can Congress go

4

to enforce constitutional guarantees, and the real

5

question in this case is what does prophylactic mean if,

6

in fact, they have a prophylactic power?

7

It would seem like they should have the most

8

expansive power that they could have under the meaning of

9

the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to racial

10
11

discrimination.

The history supports that.

Then the question is, well, how far does that

12

prophylactic power go in other areas of section 1, and our

13

argument is that it certainly can't go to the point where

14

Congress gets to redefine the meaning of the Constitution

15

rather than attempting to enforce it in some way.

16

QUESTION:

As far as our prior holdings go, have

17

we ever extended that power to anything except the equal

18

protection provisions of the Constitution?

19

MS. HAMILTON:

The only case that would indicate

20

that it was extended at all would be Hutto v. Finney, and

21

there's no prophylactic power question in that case.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I take it -- I want to make

23

sure I understand your argument.

24

with respect to the protection of rights incorporated

25

under the incorporation theory there can be no substantive

Your argument is that

1

expansion.

There simply can be a kind of reasonable means

2

ends jurisdiction to enforce, and I take it that is

3

basically what you would say the Necessary and Proper

4

Clause would have provided by its own force.

5

MS. HAMILTON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. HAMILTON:

8

I think that's right.

Why -I think McCulloch v. Maryland

applies in both instances.
QUESTION:

9

Yes, and I guess where I'm not sure

10

is, why is it that you make this distinction between the

11

protection of incorporated rights and the protection of

12

rights which are spelled out in the text of the amendment?

13

I mean, if the incorporation theory is wrong,

14

then it's wrong, but if the incorporation theory is right,

15

why can we draw a line between what section 5 provides?

16

MS. HAMILTON:

Well, the city certainly does not

17

challenge incorporation per se.

18

saying --

19

QUESTION:

We're certainly not

Okay, then how can we draw the line

20

between the rights with -- as to congressional powers to

21

incorporated rights and nonincorporated --

22

MS. HAMILTON:

I think the argument is that

23

Katzenbach v. Morgan was applied to equality rights, and

24

if there's going to be a broad reading under the

25

Fourteenth Amendment for enforcement, it would have to be

1

with equality rights, and if that's right, Katzenbach must

2

be the upper limit.

3
4
5

If Katzenbach is the upper limit, the Religious
Freedom Restoration -QUESTION:

No, but that still assumes -- when

6

you say it's the upper limit, I assume you're talking in

7

terms of categories, and you are still drawing a line

8

between Congress' power with respect to incorporated

9

rights and with respect to section 1 rights, and I don't

10

understand -- if incorporation is not to be overruled, I

11

don't understand how that line can be drawn on a

12

principled basis.

13

MS. HAMILTON:

Your Honor, the city's argument

14

does not center on extinction.

15

power that the Congress has been permitted with respect to

16

equality rights, Congress has not been permitted, indeed

17

hasn't tried what it has done with the Religious Freedom

18

Restoration Act, which is to completely redefine the

19

meaning of an entire clause of the Constitution.

20

QUESTION:

Even taking the broadest

Is your main point, then, with

21

respect to that branch of your argument that what Congress

22

may be able to do in a particularized way, focusing on a

23

discrete problem, it can't do wholesale?

24
25

MS. HAMILTON:

Is that --

That is exactly our argument,

Justice Ginsburg.

QUESTION:

1

Is that a separation of powers

2

argument in part, that we must proceed on a case-by-case

3

basis?

Is there something of that in your --

4

MS. HAMILTON:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. HAMILTON:

I think --

-- separation of powers argument?
I -- Justice Kennedy, there --

7

the separation of powers argument is that the one thing

8

that Congress cannot do is to enact a standard that will

9

apply across every law in the country and will, in fact,

10

mimic the Constitution in its scope.
QUESTION:

11

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
First of all, in response to Justice O'Connor's
first question, there are two critical differences between

10

RFRA and every section 5 case that has come before it.

11

First, there is no predicate of a violation, and second,

12

there is no attempt to remedy in any way.

13

The key problem with RFRA, what makes it

14

different from every piece of section 5 legislation that's

15

ever been reviewed by this Court or ever enacted, is that

16

it's totally global in nature.

We held

Would our holding that there was a

MR. LAYCOCK:

If that's how you read Goldman, it

is not overruled.

I always read Goldman as the military

is not changed.
QUESTION:

Well, compelling interest has an

8

We have a free exercise claim pending in the court below.

9

Keeler v. Maryland was just won on a free exercise claim

advantages to the litigant in proceeding under the free

MR. LAYCOCK:

It is always in the litigant's

interest to show that the law is not of general

applicability, that in fact it discriminates, because that

undermines the Government's compelling interest argument,

undermines the Government's credibility.

MR. LAYCOCK:

Are you answering Justice Ginsburg's

I thought I was.

I thought she

said why would there ever be again a free exercise claim.
QUESTION:

7

Because my understanding was that

this goes at least as far in protecting religious freedom

as Smith does, and then goes quite a distance further.
MR. LAYCOCK:

10

It goes some distance further.

11

There are also -- there are also ways in which it goes not

quite as far, according to some of the lower courts.

QUESTION:

Well, that's what I don't understand.

It seems to me it covered everything that the Smith

Occasionally there

would be a pregnancy case that would satisfy this Court's

This does not require a massive

What this requires is that when Government

10

substantially burdens religion, it has to justify it.

11

It's not triggered without showing a substantial burden,

12

and removing the substantial burden doesn't make the

church any better off than it was before it encountered

14

the Government --

15

QUESTION:

But zoning imposes a substantial

burden on everybody, and to say that it imposes it on

churches just as on everybody else is to bring that within

19

MR. LAYCOCK:

That's correct.

Any significant legislation comes

within this act, and you must make an exception for

Congress could pass such a law, under the theory that

you're proposing.

what you will find when you look at the record are two

kinds of agreed-upon -- that is, Court -- this Court

4

agrees, agreed-upon violation of section 1.

5

One that has gone without mention here, where

this Court itself has anticipated violations that can be

remedied prophylactically, is that in the accommodations

process more influential and politically well-connected

religions, powerful sector interests, will get exemptions

represent racial and ethnic minorities, will not get

How does that point fit into an

argument that's purely linguistic, I think, but very

important -- I'm not saying I accept it or not, but I

think a linguistic argument that is made is that Smith

says that a general law not motivated in purpose against a

1

2

Well, that was a constitutional

holding.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

3

Yes.

Yes, but the violation

4

about which you were concerned is the threat of

5

retaliatory sentencing, so you later noted in Michigan v.

Payne that that rule was greatly overinclusive in terms of

7

the actual violations.

That is, hostile sentencing.

8

But to, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, return to

9

Justice Breyer's question, what is critical here is that

10

Congress has -- in the Voting Rights Act and in others, it

11

prohibits a broader range of practices in order to get at

12

those that clearly violate the Constitution.

It may be

difficult to remedy on a case-by-case judicial approach

where you're trying to prove it, but it clearly is a

constitutional violation if an exemption is made for the

Methodist Church and the exemption is not made for the
