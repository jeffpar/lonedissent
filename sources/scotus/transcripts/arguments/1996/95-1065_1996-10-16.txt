ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

Whatever one thinks of abortion, this Court in

12

both Bray and Casey has recognized that there are common

13

and respectable reasons for opposing it.

14

challenging the prohibitions of the injunction which

15

prohibit blockades, trespass, or obstruction of access.

16

In the Western District of New York, the opposition to

17

abortion with which we are concerned involves

18

demonstrations such as picketing, leafleting, the holding

19

of a sign, or a prayer vigil.

20

We are not here

Under the one-size-fits-all injunction issued by

21

the district court, the petitioners are prohibited from

22

engaging in these form of demonstrations inside

23

overlapping speech-free zones that float without

24

geographic limitation.

25

The injunction also allows, to a very limited

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Sekulow -Yes, Justice --

-- I think we can hear you quite well

if you were to lower your voice a little.

6

MR. SEKULOW:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

The other provision of the injunction that we

8

are challenging involves a sidewalk counseling allowance.

9

It allows sidewalk counseling.

10
11

However, that sidewalk

counseling can be terminated based on facial gestures.
In other words, what we call and the lower

12

courts recognized as a cease-and-desist provision.

13

provision of the injunction is implemented on verbal or

14

nonverbal indications.

15

In fact, the injunction itself prohibits and

16

allows for -- prohibits any person being approached.

17

not just limited to women seeking the services of an

18

abortion facility.

You'd be content if we modified that

so only verbal indications would suffice?
MR. SEKULOW:

No, Justice Scalia, we would not.

That would be certainly a step in the right direction.

is it?

MR. SEKULOW:

2

That is not.

We think that the no

3

consent, and that's what this is, without consent, the

4

speech stops, and that could be before a word is even

5

uttered, and we think that provision of the injunction,

6

like the no approach zone in Madsen, because it is

7

dependent upon consent of the people speaking and the

8

people that are listening, therefore it is

9

unconstitutional, because without a doubt it burdens more

10

speech than necessary to serve any of these purposes.

that.

Yes.

MR. SEKULOW:

Justice Breyer, I think that in

2

reality we're talking about, of course, in Buffalo city

3

sidewalks and city streets, with sidewalk escorts trying

4

to get people into the clinic.

5

It's the hustle and bustle of any metropolitan

6

area, and to carry on intimate conversation, one-on-one

7

communication with a desire to dissuade, to tell someone

8

we really don't you -- want you to go into this particular

9

abortion facility.

10

That is intimate conversation.

Sure, you could be 15 feet away, but in that 15

11

feet, if you were to ask me, as a demonstrator, if I was

12

the demonstrator, you wanted some information, under this

13

injunction consensual speech is also prohibited, and

14

that's where I think, if we look at the burdening-no-

15

more-speech-than-necessary standard, why is it that 15

16

feet serves as a standard, especially --

Let me ask you -Yes, Justice Stevens.

Would 5 feet be okay?
I don't think so in the particular

If there is --

22

QUESTION:

Two feet?

23

MR. SEKULOW:

Two feet I think would approach

24

what we would consider probably blocking, certainly

25

crowding, and crowding is prohibited by section 1(c) of

the injunction and we're not challenging that, but

2

crowding in the sense that if I were blocking your access.
One of the examples that we use, and I think it

was one of the contempt proceedings -- it's found in the

5

Joint Appendix on page -- beginning -- commencing on page

6

101, actually 102 going forward.

Bonnie Behn and Carla Rainero were engaged in

sidewalk counseling.

They were held in contempt.

On page 107 of the Joint Appendix, in describing

11

what exactly was taking place, and then going on to page

12

108, and I'll refer to page 108, Bonnie Behn and Carla

13

Rainero walked alongside the young woman, her companions

14

and the escorts, and continued talking to the young woman.

You would accept

6

this injunction if it prevented you from raising your

voice to anyone going into the clinic?
MR. SEKULOW:

Oh, no, I don't think that is the

prohibition that we're concerned with.

The noise

provision, Justice Scalia, excessively loud noise to be

11

heard inside --

12

QUESTION:

To be heard inside.

MR. SEKULOW:

QUESTION:

Yes.

But you wouldn't say that this

15

injunction would be okay if it prevented the counselors

16

from shouting at the --

17

MR. SEKULOW:

No.

I think that's robust speech,

18

and this Court has talked about the need to protect robust

19

speech in public forums.

20

The fact that these sidewalks abut an abortion clinic does

21

not mean that they become enclaves immune from the First

22

Amendment.

QUESTION:

This is clearly a public forum.

Well, are you challenging the fixed

15-foot limit?
MR. SEKULOW:

We are challenging that as well.

Justice O'Connor, the way that these zones work

1

2

in operation, you have, as you acknowledge, the 15-foot

3

fixed zone, which actually is really 45 feet, because as

4

an individual approaches the clinic their bubble zone,

5

their floating zone goes with them.
QUESTION:

bubble, I'm talking about the fixed buffer zone provision.
MR. SEKULOW:

8

9

I'm not talking about the floating

The fixed buffer zone in and of

itself, Justice O'Connor, we are challenging.

Two

10

reasons.

Number 1, the Court here, before -- when it

11

issued the temporary restraining order had a speech-

12

restrictive provision initially.

13

I think what this Court said in Madsen as it

14

relates to the entire issue of was there a -- before a

15

broader injunction is issued, is there a least restrictive

16

or less restrictive injunction that just didn't do the

17

job, and I don't think that's the facts here.

18

The reality is that the injunction had a speech

19

restriction at the outset.

20

speech restriction in the final -- the preliminary

21

injunction.

23

25

QUESTION:

Then the Court increased that

Is it your position that there was no

post-TRO conduct that justified the 15-foot limit?
MR. SEKULOW:

That is our position, and I think

the record in that sense shows it, because there would

have been six contempts, or actually seven contempt

2

actions brought in an almost 18-month period, three of

3

them involving cease and desist -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

4

As I recall, Judge Meskill in the

5

panel ruling did find that there had been violations after

6

the issuance of the TRO, and if you would look at A-57 he

7

refers to an incident on March 26, 1991, in which two men

8

blocked the doorway to the clinic, and then another one on

9

January 1, so Judge Meskill, whose position I think you

10

are not challenging - -

11

MR. SEKULOW:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's correct.

-- did find post-TRO conduct that

violated the Court's order.

14

MR. SEKULOW:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's

15

correct, and we've acknowledged, and they're in the Joint

16

Appendix, there are also contempt actions that have been

17

filed.

18

QUESTION:

But you did say in your reply brief

19

that the district judge found no defendants physically

20

blocked access after the issuance of the TRO, and as I

21

read Judge Meskill's opinion that's not so.

22

MR. SEKULOW:

evidence was submitted at trial and the way we've seen the

But I wanted to inquire, what is the

6

principle that limits the Court to the conduct post-TRO

7

and pre-preliminary injunction, given the long history of

8

discord, to use the mildest term, what is it that confines

9

the district judge in thoughtfully drawing a preliminary

10

injunction after trying to preserve the peace with a TRO,

11

from crafting it in a sensible way in light of all of the

12

past history?

13

conduct?

14

Why is he confined just to this post-TRO

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that the Court should only

15

be looking at this particular injunction in light of the

16

facts that the district court have.

17

that was issued, Justice Kennedy, then, the question that

18

we would submit is, did it burden more speech than

19

necessary, and the provisions that we're challenging --

20

we're not saying that it was inappropriate to say, as the

21

court did -- it increased the -- under provision 1(c) from

QUESTION:

But Mr.

Twelve judges of the Second Circuit Court of

Appeals stated that in fact this was very different record

than in Madsen.

QUESTION:

Unlike a statute that's just

had no objection, I take it, to injunction against

MR. SEKULOW:

That is correct.

The district court did make a finding

8

that the sidewalk counselors often crowded around the

patients, and mustn't there be some kind of keep-your-

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In light of the questions about the practicality

4

of how this injunction works, it might be useful to look

5

at this case from the vantage point of the trial judge in

6

February of 1992.

7

of hearings on the preliminary injunction and weeks of

8

testimony on the contempt proceedings against Paul and

9

Robert Schenck and others who violated the temporary

10
11

At that point, he had had several days

restraining order.
One of his findings, and they're set out at

12

pages 79 to 149 of the Joint Appendix, one of his findings

13

was that these named defendants had deliberately engaged

14

in a technique of physically crowding in an intimidating

15

and obstructing manner.

16

What's a trial judge supposed to do in the face

17

of that kind of finding?

18

injunction precisely in those terms ordering the

19

defendants to cease crowding in an intimidating and

20

obstructing manner, what problems would that cause for a

21

police officer who is at the scene, trying to understand

22

how to enforce that?

23

QUESTION:

If he were to issue an

Well, one of the things he's supposed

24

to do is read the First Amendment, I take it, and what

25

he's doing here is, he's prohibiting certain conduct based

It's not just to eliminate

GENERAL DELLINGER:

5

QUESTION:

I'm --

This injunction goes much further

6

than that, and if you want to defend it as saying that

7

everything here is necessary to avoid the touching,

8

grabbing aspect, that's one thing, but the harassment

9

rationale as I see it goes much further.

It protects

10

people against repeated, very annoying, very stressful

11

expression of views by those who differ with them --

12

GENERAL DELLINGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

Justice Kennedy, I --

-- and that's a very difficult First

Amendment case.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

15

I believe that it is not

16

difficult because the trial judge did tailor this to

17

burden no more speech than necessary by making it clear

18

that this message, or messages could continue to be

19

conveyed.

20

injunction.

There's no speech that is silenced by this

21

I think the judge understood that the message

22

that someone is about to commit a deeply immoral act is

23

disturbing and upsetting, but that's the price of the

24

First Amendment.

25

right to convey that message to another, but in this case

to avoid a different kind of problem, not the message, but

2

two aspects of the crowding that are not related to the

3

message are at issue here.

QUESTION:

In --

5

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Justice Breyer, if you

6

wish -- well, in further response to Justice Kennedy, one

7

of those issues is the sheer effect of the crowding

8

itself, that is, the use of what were called constructive

9

blockades by having 4, 6, 10 people literally crowd around

10

a patient as she attempted to approach the clinic, and to

11

use that in an intimidating way.

The term,

That is intended to dissuade people from
