ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

11

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
At the outset, if I may, I would like to explain

12

briefly why we think that neither of the interests now

13

asserted by the Government to support the must-carry law

14

justifies the burdens that it imposes on speech.

15

The first argument, that the law merely

16

regulates anticompetitive conduct, fails for two reasons.

17

First, just as the Government can't ban all fund-raising

18

on the ground that some of it might be fraudulent, here

19

the Government can't forbid the sort of protected activity

20

at issue, choosing what speech to offer, unless it shows

21

at a minimum that those decisions are generally

22

anticompetitive acts and thus fall outside the scope of

23

the First Amendment, otherwise, the law is reaching too

24

far into protected activity in an effort to get at

25

unprotected activity.

1

The record, however, shows that cable operators

2

voluntarily carry the vast majority of broadcast stations,

3

those accounting for some 98 percent of actual viewing,

4

and it is wholly implausible to presume that, were it not

5

for some sort of anticompetitive bias, the cable systems

6

would carry every broadcast station regardless of how

7

minimal the viewership, in preference to the 150 or so

8

other programmers that are also seeking access.

9

QUESTION:

Well, at some point during the

10

argument -- maybe now if it's convenient -- would you just

11

explain this to me, Mr. Farr.

12

difficulty with the case.

13

is so terribly burdensome.

cancelling the broadcasters.

17

seems to me you can't have it both ways.

MR. FARR:

questions that are involved.

20

burden on rights that is substantial, even though as a

21

mathematical matter the burden on speech itself is not

22

particularly substantial, but I don't even think that is

23

the case here.

restored by must-carry, but many stations that are locked

2

in, and as the record shows now in the case, two out of

3

every three subscribers is served by a system that is

4

channel-blocked, that is, it has no available channels at

5

all for programming, and the other third of subscribers

6

are served by systems that will be channel-blocked at some

7

point.

8

system actually builds in excess capacity for permanent

9

use.

10

The Government's expert concedes that no cable

QUESTION:

Well, can we conclude from your

11

argument that if you prevail on this case a large number

12

of broadcasters will be dropped?

13
14
15

MR. FARR:

Well, I guess it depends on what the

term large number of broadcasters means.
What the record shows, and I think this is

16

consistent with essentially the Government's

17

interpretation of it as well, is that the cable operators

18

in the past, without must-carry, voluntarily carried

19

virtually all network affiliates, they carried virtually

20

all VHF independent stations, they carried a considerable

21

majority of UHF stations, about 80 percent of educational

22

stations, and even one out of three of every station that

23

did not command even a measurable viewership.

24
25

Now, if one looks at that pattern, what that
shows -- and then groups that with stations community by

1

community.

2

communities with relatively small numbers of stations,

3

four, five, six, which tends to be more the norm, the

4

cable system tends to carry -- not always, but tends to

5

carry all of the stations, or most of the stations.

6

What that effectively shows is that in

Then as you get into markets where there are

7

more and more stations, 10, 12, 14, those tend to be the

8

stations that cable systems do not regularly carry.

9

The question then depends on whether those

10

stations, even though they have very lower viewership,

11

tend to add something to the overall package that a cable

12

operator is trying to provide to its subscribers, and many

13

of those stations do.

14

That's why they're carried.

But the fact is, cable operators will not carry

15

all of the very lightly viewed stations if they believe

16

there is other programming that will provide a better fit

17

in the package that it's offering to subscribers.

18

think there's any way to put an exact number on that, but

19

we know from the history that the number was not -- in

20

terms of must-carry ads was only 6,000 in the past, and I

21

assume some of those would still be carried, and then of

22

the 30,000, some number of those would not be carried even

23

though they were before.

24
25

QUESTION:

I don't

How do you think we ought to assess

the significance of the fact -- I take it's a fact -- that

the brunt of the decisions not to carry tends to fall on

2

the new stations?

3

I think the figures were that in the absence of

4

must-carry about 50 percent of the new public broadcasting

5

channels did not get carried, and something I think in the

6

neighborhood of a third of the new nonpublic channels did

7

not get carried, so the brunt of the decisions not to

8

carry by the cable operators tends to fall on the new

9

stations.

10

How do we assess the significance of that?
MR. FARR:

Well, I think first of all it very

11

much would depend on what the programming of the new

12

stations would be.

During the period without must-carry,

3

Justice Souter, as the Court I think is aware from the

4

record, there was a great increase in the overall number

5

of broadcast stations, both commercial and noncommercial.

6

During the period from '85 to '92, there were

7

270 new stations, and from the period of

8

every market of the 209 ADI's in the country had either

9

the same number of stations or a greater number, and most

20
21

980 to

992,

had a greater number.
So when there are proliferations of stations

22

like that, the question of whether their programming is

23

going to be of interest to the particular community, or

24

the particular subscribers to a cable system, I think will

25

depend very much on what kind of programming it is.

1

As your question indicates, obviously cable

2

programmers do carry a substantial number of even those

3

brand new stations, obviously because they find something

4

in the programming that they feel will appeal generally to

5

their subscribers, but I think there can't be any absolute

6

question as to whether each one will be carried or each

7

one will not be carried.

8

circumstances.

9

QUESTION:

I think it depends on the

Do we know how many of those -- in

10

the period before the present must-carry rules, do we know

11

how many of those 50 percent and 33-1/3 percent, or

12

whatever it was, failed to survive when they were not

13

picked up by the cable channels?

14

MR. FARR:

Well, the numbers on stations that do

15

not survive suggest that the number is very low.

16

know that the number is broken out by whether they were

17

brand new stations or whether they were stations that had

18

previously existed.

19

I don't

Of course, the bringing on, even if you had no

20

cable whatsoever, the fact that you are increasing the

21

number of stations within particular television markets

22

will put pressure on the other broadcasting stations.

23

25

QUESTION:

Right.

We'd have to know the

differential to make a -- yeah, to make a -MR. FARR:

That's right.

1

simply a factor of numbers in competition, even without

2

respect to cable.
QUESTION:

3

Following up Justice Kennedy's

4

question, from the cable operator's side, is this a

5

diminishing problem to the extent that there is a problem

6

with must-carry as cable, as the channel capacity expands,

7

this becomes less and less of a problem?
MR. FARR:

8

9

Well, unfortunately, it has not

become less and less of a problem to date.

I think anyone

10

who is familiar with the cable industry at the moment

11

knows that channel space is greatly at a premium within

12

the industry as a whole.
One of the reasons for that, of course, is that

13
14

there are many new cable programmers as well as additional

15

broadcast stations that are seeking access to these cable

16

systems.

17

Now, it is true that in general the capacity of

18

cable systems is expanding, but it is not expanding at a

19

pace that is outstripping the expansion of programmers who

20

are trying to reach the audiences that cable operators

21

serve.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, when you use the term,

23

programmer -- I want to be sure I understand -- are you

24

referring to a company that presents a full line, 7 days a

25

week, 24 hours a day, or however much they're on the air,

1

or do you also include within that term companies that

2

might produce individual programs they try to sell, like

3

the Civil War documentary or something like that?

4
5

MR. FARR:

I'm using it I think as it's been in

use throughout this case to mean the first of those two.

6

QUESTION:

Just the first.

7

MR. FARR:

Essentially a network of some sort.

8

QUESTION:

We're not here concerned with the

9
10

impact on people who try to sell individual programs?
MR. FARR:

Well, I don't think they're

11

specifically plaintiffs in this particular case.

12

Obviously, to the extent, for example, that those --

13

there's a market for those programs, particularly for

14

whatever reason within cable programmers, to the extent

15

those cable programmers can't get onto the stations

16

because the broadcasters are required to be carried, it

17

may -- it would have a derivative effect on them, but

18

that's not the specific claim that's at issue here.

19
20

21

The claim here is that the programming network
itself, which wants to be carried within an area -QUESTION:

And that's the -- that's what you're

And how many of those are affiliated

MR. FARR:

If you're talking about affiliated

with cable operators --

QUESTION:

6

MR. FARR:

Right.
-- I don't have a particular number.

7

I can perhaps work backwards a little bit from the other

8

side.

9

which is the largest cable operator, has an interest in

If you look at the cable operators themselves, TCI,

10

something like 20 cable programmers.

11

its merger with Turner, is somewhere around a dozen.

12

Time Warner, after

The others are all -- there may be four or five

13

that have interests in about four or five programmers, and

14

the rest the cable operators typically have no interest.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, may I go back to the

16

subject of Justice Ginsburg's question?

17

is that the figure in the record was that when must-carry

18

came in, about, I think it was 6 percent of cable

19

operators had to drop at least one program in order to

20

comply with must-carry.

21

My recollection

The suggestion was that that figure perhaps is

22

not wholly representative of the significance of must-

23

carry because there was evidence that the cable operators

24

were sort of on their good behavior before that, but in

25

any case we got a figure of about 6 percent.

Is that figure still, so far as the record

1

2

shows, the best measure that we have of the, at least the

3

quantified significance of must-carry on the operators?

4

MR. FARR:

5

is for two reasons.

6

as a result of must-carry doesn't reflect the limitation

7

on cable operators who may at the time have been carrying

8

a broadcast station but now in a different world of

9

programming might choose not to carry that particular

10

station.

Well, to begin with I don't think it
First of all, having to add a channel

As I said -QUESTION:

11

It's true, but do we have anything

12

but a speculative basis to assess that latter

13

significance?

14

MR. FARR:

In terms --

15

QUESTION:

I mean, we'll assume it exists, but I

16

don't know how we -- I don't know that we have any

17

measurement of it.

18

MR. FARR:

Well, I don't think there is any

19

particular way to measure it, because obviously must-

20

carry has been in place since 1992, or since it was

21

implemented, so there isn't a way to test particularly

22

what cable operators will do given the program selections

23

right now.

24
25

I would point out, though, that I -- the
Government, it seems to me, in its argument tries to

1

essentially -- excuse me -- make a balancing argument here

2

saying, well, this will help broadcast stations to have

3

carriage, and we think that the impact on cable operators

4

and cable programmers won't really be all that

5

significant, and therefore I think their argument is that

6

we really needn't be concerned about what impact there is.

7

I do think, I should say, I think that's a false

8

equation.

I don't think that the First Amendment is

9

essentially a quantitative balancing test in which the

10

Government can say, we will try to benefit these speakers

11

at the expense of these other speakers as long as we

12

balance out the harms in a way that we think is in the

13

public interest.

14

qualitative standard that in fact puts a barrier to what

15

Government can do unless it is pursuing substantial

16

interests, and it has properly tailored what the law is to

17

those interests.

18

I think the First Amendment is a

QUESTION:

Well then, why do -- your implication

19

is that there is not a substantial interest here because

the beneficial impact under the three headings that Turner

21

I spoke of is insufficiently significant.

statement of what's implicit in your argument?

23

MR. FARR:

Is that a fair

It is implicit in this sense, I

24

think, Justice Souter, if I understand the question.

25

the beginning of my argument I indicated that I -- the

At

1

reasons that I thought that the anticompetitive rationale

2

for this law would not stand up, that the law is simply

3

way to broad for any demonstrated anticompetitive

4

behavior, and in addition, although I didn't get a chance

5

to say it, there is the tailoring problem specifically

6

addressed by Judge Williams, that the law in fact imposes

7

discrimination.

8

any bias that the Government presumes to be there.

9

It just doesn't relieve the burdens of

So I think if one takes that interest out, as I

10

think properly the Court should, then the question is, can

11

the Government use the means of forcing access onto the

12

private media in order to serve their goal of promoting

13

broadcasting for over-the-air viewers?

14

I think that's a straight, fundamental question

15

about the power of Government, and I don't think the

16

answer to that question depends primarily on some

17

balancing between --

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

19

MR. FARR:

-- the amount of benefit to the

20
21

broadcasters and harm to the programmers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, you say that the First

22

Amendment doesn't require -- it doesn't usually import any

23

balancing, but when you're talking about, is there a

24

substantial Government interest here under the O'Brien

25

test, that itself is a form of balancing, isn't it?

1

MR. FARR:

Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, there certainly has to be a weighing, if that is

3

a proper term, of the governmental interest, but I don't

4

think that can be divorced from the question of the means

5

by which the Government is pursuing it.

6

Certainly, the Government can pursue the

7

interest of benefiting individual broadcast stations, for

8

example, by granting them subsidies, or by providing other

9

forms of benefit to encourage their development.

10

QUESTION:

Do you say it can't, then, simply

11

promote broadcast television in general because it's free

12

to the listener?

13

MR. FARR:

I'm not saying that they can't

14

promote it in general.

15

promote it in general.

16

In fact, I agree that they can

What I'm saying is, though, that when they come

17

to the question of means, how they are doing it, when they

18

say the means by which we are going to promote it are to

19

limit the speech rights of others, then they're running up

20

against a barrier that the First Amendment imposes.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, suppose -- this is not a

22

hypothetical.

It comes from Justice O'Connor's opinion

23

last time around -- the Government simply said, to the

24

extent that you have unused channels, just to that extent,

25

you must carry, so you can't leave any channels idle, but

if you fill them up with cable programmers, whatever,

2

that's okay.

3

MR. FARR:

Obviously, that would be a less

restrictive alternative, there's no question about that.

5

I think in fairness I should make two points,

6

though.

7

have any impact, because the relationship between cable

8

operators and their subscribers is essentially the coin of

9

the realm for cable operators, and for them to put

10

programming on and take it off does introduce some

11

irritation.

12

First of all, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't

The second point is that I'm not sure it really

13

serves the Government interest to have a broadcast station

14

on for a month or two and then take it off, but if the

15

Government felt that that -- and could demonstrate that

16

that did substantially advance its interest, that would be

17

a less restrictive alternative.

18

QUESTION:

Less restrictive; why?

Because -- I

19

mean, the First Amendment is certainly violated when you

20

are compelled to say something, whether or not you had

21

intended to say something else.

22

MR. FARR:

It's less restrictive because it only

23

has one of the two constitutional flaws of the must-carry

24

statute, because in that particular case it is not

25

excluding a programmer at that moment that the operator

MR. FARR:

The must-carry law has both of those

effects, that's correct.
QUESTION:

May I ask you if you think that

section 4 and section 5 are equally bad, or equally good,

10

MR. FARR:

I do believe that they are equally

First Amendment puts a limitation on the means Government

14

can use to advance speech.

The fact is that -- for the same

I don't think that particularly changes with the

16

content of the speech and, indeed, if the Court were to

17

rely on the content of the speech to make that

18

determination, I think it would call into some question

19

the use of the intermediate standard.

20

I should point out that with respect to the

21

interest in preventing anticompetitive behavior, the

22

argument with respect to the public TV stations really is

23

an even weaker argument than it is with respect to the

commercial TV stations.

I mean, you see, you know, this is sponsored by Mobil in

MR. FARR:

5

I don't think, though, typically,

6

that someone who is choosing to donate to a public

7

television station is choosing between that and running a

8

local ad on the cable system.

9

of that, but I think generally the advertising market that

There may be some instances

10

one is talking about is the actual commercial advertising

market.

QUESTION:

Well, but they -- but they do choose

13

to make the endorsement or not based on a projection of

14

the size of the audience, surely?

15

MR. FARR:

Oh, I think that is true.

I'm not

16

saying -- what I'm saying is that that would not,

17

think, be a reason that a cable system would not run a

18

public broadcast station, in the hopes that it would draw

19

off what would otherwise be donated to the broadcast

20

station and to add it to its own advertising revenues.

21

Whether it had an effect on the public TV station is a

22

separate question.

I would like to return to a point that came up a

to a certain number of operators, and even those, most of

2

them have a relatively small number of interests in

3

programmers, but I should say something which I think has

4

not really received enough attention in this case in the

5

lower courts as well, that I think vertical integration is

6

essentially a red herring here, and I think that for a

7

couple of reasons.

I think Judge Williams is perfectly correct that
if you look at vertical integration the statute is not at

all tailored to it.

16

them, and the -- one of the provisions authorizes the

17

commission to set limits on the number of integrated

18

programmers that an operator can carry, which has been set

19

basically at 40 percent, but another one of them has a

20

specific nondiscrimination provision barring cable

21

operators from discriminating on the basis of affiliation,

22

so the idea that the must-carry law itself, that part of

23

the act was intended to remedy a problem of vertical

integration it seems to me is belied by the other

25

purposes -- excuse me, by the other provisions of the act

itself.

2

Now,

I'd just like to make one point about the

3

anticompetitive argument, because I think it's critical in

4

thinking about what the Government calls structural

5

regulation, but keep in mind two things about structural

6

regulation.

7

First of all,

just calling something structural

8

regulation doesn't seem to me to indicate much about

9

where -- how it should be analyzed under the First

10

Amendment.

11

regulate, and what the structural regulation here is

12

regulating is who can speak on a cable system.

13

First of all, the question is what does it

The second thing is that structural regulation

14

is by its nature prophylactic, and prophylactic regulation

15

is,

16

First Amendment.

17

as this Court has often said, disfavored under the

So I would submit that just because the

18

Government characterizes something as economic regulation

19

or structural regulation, even under O'Brien, the Court

20

has to look carefully at the assumptions that the

21

Government makes to justify a broad prophylactic law and,

22

furthermore, has to look at the remedy that's imposed to

23

see if the remedy is consistent with the types of remedies

24

that are imposed in other industries not involving speech,1

25

because if it's not,

if the remedy that is used,

as it is

here, is broader than what would be used in another

comparable situation, then the Government it seems to me

3

has a strong burden of answering why the other remedy is

not a suitable, less restrictive --

7

QUESTION:

Is the term structural borrowed from

some body of the law?
MR. FARR:

Not that I know of.

It -- I believe

8

it's just a -- something which is being used to describe

9

in a loose fashion regulation that does aim at a

10

particular industry but is not specifically aimed at the

11

content of speech.

Very well, Mr. Farr.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Many of the discussions that you've had so far

this morning with Mr. Farr related to his discussion of

22

23

I want to be

1

important, substantial, content-neutral, unrelated to the

2

suppression of free expression, and solidly grounded in

3

reasonable inferences that are based upon substantial

4

evidence.

5

In spite of the talk about the anticompetitive

6

market foreclosure effects, there is, as Justice Kennedy's

7

opinion recognized in Turner I, a very clear principal

8

goal of the must-carry law, and that is to preserve a

9

healthy multiplicity of broadcast sources for the 40

10

percent of American homes that do not have cable, homes

11

that rely upon free, over-the-air broadcasting as the

12

entire source of their television programming.

13

When cable systems deny carriage to local

14

broadcast stations, and thereby foreclose those stations

15

from reaching the 60-percent of households, often more

16

affluent, that rely upon cable, those local broadcast

17

stations lose revenue and suffer financially.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, I -- General

19

Dellinger, I'm sorry -- I suppose it can be said that

20

whenever you save a single station that would otherwise go

21

out of business you're preserving the diversity, in a

22

sense, but I thought that what our earlier opinion meant

23

was that, did you not save this broadcaster, or the ones

24

that are saved by this legislation, there would not be any

25

diversity, period.

the Government.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

I think what is shown by the

dropping of a few stations is something about which

Congress can legitimately be concerned, that would support

10

I think that's a critical part of Mr. Farr's

argument as well.
If you take a community that has six or seven

stations, and seven local over-the-air broadcast stations

13

is about the national average, if you take a community and

16

MR. ENNIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to make two interrelated points.

17

The first is, is that Congress reasonably predicted that

18

in the absence of must-carry there would be significant

19

injury to broadcast stations which would threaten the

20

Government interest in preserving a multiplicity of

21

broadcast sources, and the second point is that the

22

presence of must-carry has actually caused very modest and

23

decreasing injury to cable operators and cable programs.

24
25

First, on the injury to broadcast stations,
Congress did not predict that the entire broadcast system

would disappear without must-carry, but it did
2

specifically predict in its findings that without must-

3

carry, quote, additional local broadcast signals will be

4

deleted, repositioned, or not carried, and that would

threaten the multiplicity of broadcast sources which was

the Government interest.

That prediction turned out to be absolutely
correct.

QUESTION:

12

Look, Mr. Ennis, there's no

about there being a significant repositioning as a result

of must-carry, but isn't the ultimate measure of the value

of that repositioning, or its absence, the 31-station

measure?

18

In other words, as I understand the evidence,

19

out of over 40,00 broadcast stations and, indeed, out of

20

8,000 that were directly affected by must-carry, only 31

In fact, the number of vacant channels had

increased as much as the number of new stations, because

many broadcast stations had given up, and were simply

14

turning in their construction permits.

15

They knew that broadcast advertising revenues,

16

the lifeblood of broadcasting, had declined in real

that by 1991, broadcast revenues were lower than they were

MR. ENNIS:

No.

No, we're not.

Why not?
Because Congress expressly found in

wanted to rely on market forces to the maximum extent

possible to decide which broadcast stations would survive

and which would not.

Congress was not saying -But the justification, as I

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I don't think it's a

judgment about a higher quality of programming.

and then let the market determine, based on market needs,

3

which stations would survive and which would not.

4

It wanted to remove that structural impediment

Congress didn't dictate we want this station to

survive and that not, which is why a subsidy would be

6

inconsistent with that specific policy objective, and

7

would also risk entangling the Government in very specific

content-based judgments.

9

The Government would have to decide, if this

station is not doing well in the market because it has

poor programming, we have to tell the station to start

First of all, the cable industry itself did not

cripple the broadcast industry and, in fact, in this case

24

we produced in discovery their own documents in which they

concluded that carriage is critical to broadcast stations.
If you look at the Joint Appendix at pages 2147

2

3

and 2158, those are cable documents which are sealed,

4

because the cable industry insisted that they remain

5

sealed, but those documents themselves conclude that

6

carriage is critical to the survival of a broadcast

7

station.
It may be that the broadcast station would be

8

9

forced to pay more attention to the local market, but its

10

advertising revenues would shrink by at least 60 percent,

11

and without the advertising revenues lost to the cable

12

audience it wouldn't have the revenue to produce the

13

programming that would be responsive to the over-the-air

14

audience.

15

That's what Congress reasonably concluded.
Let me simply say that, with respect to the

16

injury to cable, that's modest indeed.

17

the channel capacity in this Nation is occupied by new,

18

must-carry stations cable operators were forced to add.

Only 1 percent of

This Court also asked how much channel capacity,

20

previously unused channel capacity could be devoted to the

carriage of must-carry stations, and the answer, as the

evidence shows, is that 87 percent of the time when a

23

cable operator was forced to add a must-carry station, it

24

did so with previously unused channel capacity.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

One of the difficulties, I think, in addressing

8

the Government's interest here is that it is still

9

difficult to pin down.

The specific finding by Congress

10

made in the act is that as a result of the economic

11

incentive that cable systems have to delete its set of

12

local broadcast systems, coupled with the absence of must-

13

carry, the economic viability of free local broadcast

14

television and its ability to originate quality local

15

programming will be seriously jeopardized.

16

finding by Congress itself, not arguments made by the

17

executive branch.

18

That is the

Then, however, it seems that the argument had

19

turned at some point to survival of broadcasters, that in

20

fact the existence of cable itself would harm individual

21

broadcasters, which in our view at least is itself a less

22

significant interest than some broad -- broader interest

23

indicating that a multiplicity of voices in a significant

24

number of communities would be lost.

QUESTION:

If it's content-based but doesn't

affect First Amendment rights, no problem.

3

MR. FARR:

Of course.

QUESTION:

How can it be content-based and not

affect First Amendment rights?
MR. FARR:

Because the Government can say, we

7

are going to subsidize something with a particular

8

content, and if it does -- if those are the means by which

9

it's choosing to do it, that is one thing.

10

When it says, we are going to subsidize

11

essentially by means of using you, by using your channels

12

and shutting out other programmers, that's our way of

13

subsidizing it, that falls on the other side of the First

14

Amendment line, and that seems to me, when you're talking

15

about the quality of programming, that is where the

16

interest has now shifted.

17

Survival is not particularly an issue.

I mean,

18

a very small number of stations, as the Court has noted,

19

even went dark, and many of them returned to the air.

20

mean, these figures, as was pointed out in the briefs,

21

include a station that was -- whose transmitter was hit by

22

a tornado, so what we're talking about, when we -- but

23

when you move from there on to talk about the question of

24

the programming being maintained or enhanced at a certain

25

level, that seems to me to open up a whole area of First

I

1

Amendment objections that this Court has really never

2

entered into before, I mean, that's in a sense the

3

Pruneyard case unleashed, that says, when we want to

4

encourage diversity, and we want to stimulate more of a

5

particular kind of voice, of particular speakers, whether

6

it's done by viewpoint or not, we can essentially take a

7

business of speech, a private business, and use that as

8

the means of doing it.

10

That is a line that I don't believe the Court
has ever crossed, and I don't think should cross now.
QUESTION:

11

So the FCC's efforts to, in the

12

fifties, sixties, seventies, to get the broadcasters to

13

have news and public service, et cetera, also in your view

14

are unconstitutional?

MR. FARR:

Well, if you're talking -- I'm sorry,

QUESTION:

The NBC, ABC, you know, all the

if -- I --

18

networks in the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies,

19

the FCC encouraged them in very strong ways to carry news

and public service broadcasting.

also unconstitutional?

MR. FARR:

In your view, was that

When I said it crossed a First

23

Amendment line that had not been crossed, it has been

24

crossed partially in the broadcasting context, and the

Court has looked at one or two specific examples of it,

for example in Red Lion, and said it was tolerable.

League of Women Voters, it said that was beyond the

commission's power to interfere in content, so I'm not

sure where the precise answer would be.
