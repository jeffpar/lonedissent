ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALLACE B. JEFFERSON

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15

MR. JEFFERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

16

The Commissioners of Bryan County, Oklahoma, are

17

required by statute to levy and collect nearly $900,000 in

18

taxes to satisfy the judgment in this case.

19

might reasonably inquire how they became liable to pay

such damages to the respondents.

23

liability contained in the decision of the Fifth Circuit.

under section 1983 because its sheriff employed his

nephew, who subsequently was held to have used excessive

2

force during the course of an investigatory stop.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Jefferson, would you just

4

straighten me out on how much money is at stake?

5

thought that apart from $100,000 the rest of the award

6

against the county sticks because it's just based on State

7

law negligence?

8

consented, or the county is liable for ordinary negligence

9

under State law, no civil right thing.

10

Wasn't that -- that the State has

about only $100,000 of the award.
MR. JEFFERSON:

MR. JEFFERSON:

Your Honor, if you'll look at

20

the judgment, the judgment that's in the appendix to the

21

petition for cert.

23

officer for somewhere near $800,000.

6

But you -- in the opening you made a

statement about how much was at stake, and I just wanted

8

to point out that it seems to me that most of this is

9

plain old ordinary negligence under State law, and we're

20

only talking about part of the award.
MR. JEFFERSON:

21

22

I appreciate that, Justice

Ginsburg.
What the Fifth Circuit found was that because

the nephew pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and other

25

misdemeanor offenses before he was hired, the Fifth

2

him in the first place.

then held that the sheriff's decision actually caused the

injury suffered by the respondent at the hands of the

nephew.

In the first place, Bryan County never adopted an

QUESTION:

What instructions on causation were

10

given here, and what should have been given, and did the

11

county preserve any objection?
MR. JEFFERSON:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

The

13

instructions are contained in 124 (a) through 132(a) of the

14

Joint Appendix.

15

standard deliberate indifference instruction that this

16

Court has derived from Canton and other cases.

17

The objections were clear.

The instruction on causation was the

The objections were

18

that there is no policy in this case of hiring unqualified

19

applicants, there is no policy of hiring one individual

officer, and that as a matter of law the case ought not to

be submitted to the jury.

1

under these instructions could have based liability on a

2

finding of just but-for causation?

3

MR. JEFFERSON:

Exactly, Your Honor.

4

that that is what they found.

5

QUESTION:

6

7

I think

And has this Court approved that

approach?
MR. JEFFERSON:

It has not.

It has not approved

8

that approach, and in fact the causation has to be much

9

more highly regulated than a but-for causation under

10

Canton, under Tuttle, under every single case that this

11

Court has decided in the section 1983 context.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Jefferson, could we go back to

13

the question of policy, and you have said the county

14

doesn't have a policy here, and I guess more exactly the

15

sheriff doesn't have a policy here of hiring unqualified

16

or violence-prone applicants.

17

MR. JEFFERSON:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It makes perfect sense to distinguish

19

between policy and implementation, or failure to implement

20

the policy, when the policy is made by one person or body

21

and it's being carried out by another one.

22

If the county commissioners were setting this

23

policy and they said, investigate the applicants carefully

24

and don't hire ones with criminal records indicating

25

violence, and somebody like the sheriff, for whatever

1

reason, failed to follow it, we would say one instance

2

does not convert that instance into county policy.

3

only when the policymakers know that it's not being

4

carried out and they do nothing about it that we can say

5

they become deliberately indifferent to it, and so on.

It's

The trouble is, here we have a different

6

7

situation.

The policy is being made by the sheriff

8

himself, and on the one hand we'll assume that the sheriff

9

has traditionally had a general policy of investigating

10

applicants and not hiring those with criminal records

11

indicating violence, but we also have to face the fact

12

that it was the sheriff himself who said, in effect, I

13

didn't even bother to finish reading the criminal record.

14

I didn't care.

15

When the policymaker himself does not follow

16

that policy, why don't we judge the policymaker based on

17

that one instance, rather than saying, oh, well, we'll

18

wait and see if he does it several times before we

19

attribute a change of policy to him?

20

MR. JEFFERSON:

I think there are several

21

answers to that question.

Maybe even not the first in

22

order of priority is, compare what happened in this case

23

to what happened in Pembaur, where again the county

24

prosecutor there made one decision and the Court held in a

25

plurality opinion that was enough to establish liability

and arrest --

3

That decision to go in without a warrant

QUESTION:

Because it was a deliberate decision

4

in that case, wasn't it?

5

MR. JEFFERSON:

It was a deliberate decision,

that's correct, Your Honor, just like in our case a

7

deliberate decision to hire Stacy Burns, no question about

8

that.

QUESTION:

MR. JEFFERSON:

12

QUESTION:

Well, do we have the option to

characterize it as negligence?

Or negligence, a negligent -- a

negligent failure --

And a deliberate decision not to even

that's what it is.

QUESTION:

I think we can speculate that

20

can't call it negligence.

1

are as consistent -- when you look at the facts, they're

2

as consistent with either finding negligence, failure to

3

use ordinary care, or, Your Honors, even a finding that he

4

was pursuing his own personal interest in hiring --

5

employing his nephew.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, but the jury did find deliberate

7

indifference, didn't it?

8

MR. JEFFERSON:

11

You're correct, Your Honor,

that -QUESTION:

So that the fact --we have to take

the facts as they come to us, I suppose.

12

MR. JEFFERSON:

13

QUESTION:

And I'm offering the facts.

I don't know why we would

14

recharacterize them, and if we don't recharacterize them,

15

why aren't we in a Pembaur situation?

16

MR. JEFFERSON:

Justice Souter, the other answer

17

to that question is, in Pembaur it was a governmental

18

purpose that this county prosecutor was furthering.

19

think the answer here is, we don't know what the purpose

20

was, and I don't think, just because the jury found that

21

there was deliberate indifference here that you're -- this

Court is bound to that opinion, when -- when there's --

policy isn't in the statute, is it?

2

MR. JEFFERSON:

3

QUESTION:

No, it is not.

I mean, that's just sort of a

4

shorthand that we've used, and maybe in a close case we

5

should stop using it.

6

policy, it requires a statute, ordinance, regulation,

7

custom, or usage.

8

policy, but it's hard to see how a single act can

9

establish a custom or usage.

The statute doesn't require a

Now, maybe a single act may establish a

MR. JEFFERSON:

10

I think that's exactly correct,

11

Your Honor, and this raises -- this case raises the

12

question in Pembaur which I don't think was fully

13

resolved, and Chief Justice Rehnquist, you'll recall this.

14

Is it the case that every time someone who is

15

designated policymaker makes a decision, no matter what it

16

is, that he's making policy for the county?

Isn't the answer to that clearly no?
Yes, it is.

But whether he is or whether he isn't

depends on whether the action is essentially a negative

action or whether it's an intentional one.

Even if he had read it --

Isn't that what it turns on?
I think -- I think not, Your

Honor, but even if he had read what was in the record --

easy one to make based on these facts, but I think the

constitutional.

MR. JEFFERSON:

I disagree with that, Your

Honor.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JEFFERSON:

Why?
Because there's nothing in the

which we've been characterizing as deliberate

indifference, and I would suppose that it could be found

3

to be within the scope of deliberate indifference.

4
5

MR. JEFFERSON:

Well,

I disagree, and I think

that that is a policy question for the Court.
QUESTION:

6

Well, Mr. Jefferson, even if there's

7

a finding here of deliberate indifference, does that mean

8

that the jury does not have to evaluate whether that

9

single act of deliberate indifference caused the

10

respondent's injuries?
I don't think they were asked to decide that.

11
12

It was a theory that, well, this employee was hired, and

13

therefore there had to be causation, because if he hadn't

14

been hired, this accident wouldn't have occurred, and

15

isn't something more required than that?

16
17
18

MR. JEFFERSON:

Yes, Your Honor. I mean,

there -QUESTION:

Even if there was deliberate

19

indifference in a single act of hiring, it seems to me an

20

act that no law required or prohibited the hiring of

21

someone with misdemeanor convictions, and --

22

QUESTION:

Isn't it true, Mr. Jefferson, that

23

the jury specifically found that the inadequate hiring

24

directly caused the plaintiff's injury?

It did.

that still could not constitute a basis for liability?

3

MR. JEFFERSON:

I think you have to be very

4

careful, Your Honor, when we're talking about what is

5

really a negligent hiring.
QUESTION:

6

I'm assuming that the record is so

7

clear that any competent sheriff would have recognized a

8

serious danger to the public by letting this man be hired

9

as a police officer.

10

That still would not justify

liability, as I understand your theory.
MR. JEFFERSON:

11

It would not.

It would not be

unconstitutional to hire him, and I'll support that with a

13

case that Your Honor wrote for a unanimous Court, the

Collins v. Harker Heights case.

16

There was clear evidence

It's under the Due Process Clause, and I

understand that's a different amendment that we're talking

about, but there was clear evidence there that sending

violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the plaintiff.

2
3

MR. JEFFERSON:

But you would have to find here

that the county violated the Constitution.

4

QUESTION:

Well, and my question is, if it had

5

been as foreseeable as my hypothetical suggested, you

6

would still say no.

7

MR. JEFFERSON:

I would say no, and I give as an

8

answer, Your Honor, Collins v. Harker Heights.

In that,

9

you stated the Due Process Clause is not a guarantee

10

against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions, and

11

that's correct.

12

I mean, there are States that have lesser

13

standards than Oklahoma's does, there are States that have

14

more severe standards, but nothing about any of those

15

standards in and of themselves shows that the standard is

16

unconstitutional.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Jefferson, you put Pembaur in one

18

box because that involved a direction by the prosecutor,

19

go do it, so the causation problem that Justice O'Connor

20

brought up here didn't exist there, but you also had in

21

your brief something about a category of dangerous

22

practices, and I was not clear on what would fit that

category.

-- what is a dangerous practice that

might make the municipality liable?

3

I had in mind something like

Canton, where a dangerous practice would be putting people

been clear for generations now that there is no respondeat

6

MR. SERR:

This Court in Canton looked at the

7

language of section 1983 and decided that section 1983

8

admits of no distinctions between actions of the

9

municipality that directly authorize or command

10

constitutional violations or actions that just are

11

deliberately indifferent and directly cause constitutional

12

violations.

13

words like intent, or directly authorize, or command.

14

Canton's already done that.

15

The language of section 1983 does not include

The action does not have to be unconstitutional.

MR. SERR:

Okay.

Well, Canton actually involved

2

police officers that failed to discern a severe emotional

3

disturbance in an arrestee, and the Court said, well,

4

there was no notice of any need -- of any obvious need to

5

train in that matter, but Canton did recognize that there

6

are certain recurring situations that police officers to a

7

moral certainty will face, such as decisions regarding the

8

use of force, clear constitutional duties in recurrent

9

situations regarding the use of force - - Do I use force?

10

How much force do I use?

11

such that counties are inherently on notice that that is

12

the job description of a police officer.

13

QUESTION:

How do I apply that force? --

Well, that was the allegation here,

14

the use of excessive force that turned on that, and yet

15

the instruction given on deliberate indifference, as I

16

understand it, required the jury to assess whether it was

17

so obvious that Sheriff Moore's decision would lead to

18

violations, plural, of constitutional rights, plural.

19

Now, doesn't Canton at least suggest that we

20

require a jury to conclude that the violation of a

21

discrete and identifiable right, here the right to be free

22

from excessive force used, would be obvious and here, how

23

do we know, under that instruction, that the jury wasn't

24

just thinking, well, with that misdemeanor record probably

25

some right would be violated?

Be that as it may, maybe that hadn't

been thought through, or it wasn't pressed as a point.

9

Here, it becomes key, and it seems to me it left it very

open.
I mean, you can say in every case that a

constitutional deprivation by the officer who's hired

13

wouldn't have occurred if the employee hadn't been hired,

14

and what is there in the instructions that makes clear

15

that isn't the basis?

MR. SERR:

Well, that was precisely the problem

17

faced by this Court in Canton with respect to failure-to-

18

train cases, that it would be easy for a plaintiff to

19

manufacture a situation of respondeat superior:

had only trained the officers in Canton to recognize

21

severe emotional disturbance, this wouldn't have happened.

MR. SERR:

No.

My thinking is that deliberate

key, criminal recklessness by the municipality itself.

QUESTION:

Criminal recklessness is the

Well, you know, if you're talking

10

about what you find in the statute, where do you find

11

criminal recklessness in the statute?

12

MR. SERR:

Well, in the Canton case, and I guess

13

this traces back to Justice O'Connor's opinion in Kibbe,

14

there was a concern by this Court about what to do with

15

those policies that are not facially unconstitutional, or

16

those policies, actions of a municipality that do not

17

directly authorize constitutional deprivation, the failure

18

to train cases, the bad hiring cases, and Justice O'Connor

19

articulated in her opinion in Kibbe that the reason we

20

need a deliberate indifference requirement is to satisfy

21

that causation requirement in the statute.

22

QUESTION:

There was --

In answer to the Chief Justice's

23

question in the hypothetical that he put you where they

24

hire the nephew, was that a policy?

MR. SERR:

Absolutely.

2

that was a policy.

3

QUESTION:

And then if they -- suppose they

MR. SERR:

That would be negligence, perhaps

9

requires criminal recklessness.

10

That would not be an actionable
Canton

Canton says that when you've got deliberate

11

indifference, deliberate disregard of constitutional

12

rights, then you have a policy as that term was used by

13

Monell, so long as that deliberate indifference is

14

attributable to the county itself.

15

QUESTION:

I don't see how the state of mind of

16

the actor can make something a policy.

17

policy is a practice that's followed in an -- you know,

18

thick and thin, that sort of thing.

19

and whether it's a negligent departure or a deliberately

20

indifferent departure, it's still -- one swallow doesn't

21

make a summer.

MR. SERR:

In other words, a

The majority in Pembaur actually

reported several dictionary definitions of policy in a

footnote, and those dictionary definitions of policy even

refer to a single decision.

We -- also, I think the lack of hiring suits

speaks well of the municipal policymakers in this country,

13

that normally when they see that red flag they don't hire,

14

or if they hire, they take some corrective measures

deliberate indifference standard requires of persons to
