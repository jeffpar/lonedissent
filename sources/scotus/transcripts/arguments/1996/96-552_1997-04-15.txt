ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

9

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL DELLINGER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
We ask you today to overrule Aguilar because it

12

13

is inconsistent with this Court's Establishment Clause

14

decisions and because it continues to impose burdens that

15

seriously impair the Federal Government's critical title I

16

program.

17

I would like to discuss both the reasons why we

18

believe that this is an appropriate procedural posture for

19

the reconsideration of Aguilar, and why we believe that a

20

decision to overrule Aguilar need not require any major

21

doctrinal revisions of this Court's Establishment Clause

22

jurisprudence.

23

In brief, the critical features that support the

24

constitutionality of on-premises services under title I

25

and the lifting of the outstanding injunction are these.

Unlike all of this Court's other primary and secondary

parochial school aid cases, this case involves an act of

3

Congress that provides new and additional resources to

4

both public and private school students.
Ninety-seven percent of the funding under title

QUESTION:

These

They are required by law

General Dellinger -Yes.

-- you're not suggesting that an act

13

of Congress should be treated any differently than an act

14

of a State legislature, are you, for purposes of

15

Establishment Clause jurisprudence?
GENERAL DELLINGER:

16

No, I am not, Mr. Chief

17

Justice.

18

the State acts that this Court has struggled over provided

19

funds -- since there was a background of public education

20

provided funds just for nonpublic schools.

21

in Wolman v. Walters was an $88-million appropriations for

22

the nonpublic schools.

23

What I intend to suggest by that is that many of

to public schools.

4

Of the 6.4 million, for example, 6.2 million went

QUESTION:

It's so broad a group.
Do you take the position that

5

Congress, or for that matter a State, could simply

6

appropriate money generally for the teaching of secular

7

subjects and that money could go into the parochial

8

schools without a First Amendment problem?

9
10

GENERAL DELLINGER:
QUESTION:

We do not, Justice Souter.

Well, how do you draw the line?

You

11

have spoken of this as being a supplementation of what is

12

regularly done, but as I understand it, the money is spent

13

on what are called remedial programs.

14

In other words, if a group of children or a

15

child cannot read at whatever the grade level, this money

16

is used to provide special training, but it seems to me

17

that what that boils down to is teaching a child to read,

18

or teaching a child who can't add how to do math, and I

19

don't see what the distinction is between the

20

supplementation and simply the school's normal mission to

21

teach reading or to teach math, or whatever the secular

22

subject is.

23

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Justice Souter, I think it

24

is well-established that -- though I do agree that there's

25

no bright line between remedial mathematics and other

1

math, but what is critical is that the Federal title I

2

money was so clearly intended to be, and the statute and

3

the regulations require it to be, a supplementation that

4

goes to the benefit of these low-income needy children

5

that I do not think this case raises the question that

6

would be raised when taxpayer funding takes over a

7

significant portion of the regular educational curriculum.

8

That is, the -- it is not unfamiliar throughout Federal

9

law for Congress to have requirements, as title I does,

10

that the funds should be used to supplement and in no case

11

supplant the level of services that would in the absence

12

of this funding have been available.

3

QUESTION:

Well, what if Congress comes along

4

and says every school district in the United States that

5

spends less than X dollars per pupil will be subject to

6

supplementation by Federal grant for the teaching of

7

secular subjects, and this money can go to parochial as

8

well as private schools.

9

of legitimacy that you urge this morning?

20

Would that fall under the rubric

GENERAL DELLINGER:

As you describe it, I

21

believe that that would cause a more far-reaching revision

22

of the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence than

23

anything we

QUESTION:

How would we draw the line?

QUESTION:

1

Congress would say this is a

2

supplement for poor school districts.

3

GENERAL DELLINGER:

You draw the line here

4

because this appropriation has none of the indicia of

5

Congress providing the support that then enables the

6

institution to engage in its religious function more

7

fully.

QUESTION:

8

9

For example, in the case -Well, it allows parochial schools to

teach reading better than they could teach it otherwise

10

just as public schools can teach reading better than they

11

could teach it or are teaching it otherwise, so I don't

12

see how we draw the line.

13

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Well, first of all, that is,

14

of course, as true under the program as it has existed

15

from 1965 to 1997 as it is under the issue that is before

16

is here.

There's still the --

QUESTION:

GENERAL DELLINGER:

20

Except -There's the same

supplementation -QUESTION:

Except that at least an attempt is

21

made to draw a visual line, if you will, between what the

22

school is ultimately accomplishing and the secular source

23

by which it is accomplishing this extra objective.

24

There's an attempt made to avoid an appearance endorsement

25

kind of problem, and on your scheme there wouldn't be an

attempt made.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

2

Here, I believe the attempt

3

is not only made but it is fully successful to

4

differentiate this program from a program like Grand

5

Rapids v. Ball, which we are not challenging, which we --

6

in this submission at all.

7

QUESTION:

General Dellinger --

8

GENERAL DELLINGER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I assume that it enables a

10

parochial school to teach better if you allow a person who

11

knows sign language to enable its deaf students to

12

understand what is being taught in a class better.

Of course it does, Justice

Scalia, as does -QUESTION:

1

to the point of saying that any aid for the teaching of a

2

secular subject in a parochial school is therefore

3

constitutional?

4

GENERAL DELLINGER:

I don't think you have

5

crossed that line for this reason.

6

like Grand Rapids that has a very different profile, where

7

40 of the 41 schools that were benefited were sectarian

8

schools, unlike the 3 percent here, and where the courses

9

that were provided were courses provided that were a part

10

of the school curriculum -- in fact, they were ordered up

by the school.

If you take a case

They were much more woven into the normal

This is a title I service which is provided to

14

kids, low-income educationally deprived children who need

15

this service, and what this Court's decisions I believe in

16

Zobrest and Witters and Bowen v. Kendrick reject is an

17

arbitrary, rigid, formalistic notion that you cannot have

18

those services provided by a public employee who is hired,

19

fired, supervised, and paid by other public employees

20

inside the school building, but instead you must make

kids are in grades 1 to 3.

QUESTION:

1

General Dellinger, may I deflect you

2

for a moment, because you're launching right into the

3

merits as you did in your briefs, and you have to get your

4

foot in the door properly.

5

I do not know of any use, ever, of 60(b) such as

6

we see here, essentially to gain rehearing by this Court,

7

so if you could spend just a couple of moments -GENERAL DELLINGER:

8

9

Ginsburg.

I would be glad to, Justice

You are correct that this -- we do not know of

10

another instance in which Rule 60(b) has been used in this

11

way, but maybe for very good reasons.

12

That is, the understandable reasons may be that

13

they are in a -- in a messy and complicated country like

14

ours, there are usually lots of other cases that bubble

15

up, other jurisdictions that simply don't comply with this

16

Court's holdings, but here the Secretary of Education will

17

not permit any school district in the United States to

18

provide these services on premises, so that there is for

19

that reason unlikely to be an issue.

20

Now, in terms of --

21

QUESTION:

What about the two cases that are --

22

are there not cases involving State law similar to title

23

I, one in Louisiana and the other, is it in Minnesota?

24
25

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Two responses.

all, as I said, I think those may well be different than a

program of the breadth of title I, but secondly there is

2

no suggestion -- there have been a series of cases where

3

the provision of these title I services off-premises has

4

been challenged.

5

Establishment Clause challenge those cases, and those who

6

brought the case have not sought certiorari in this Court.

7

The courts have upheld against

I think that there must be some way for a court

8

to modify one of its own prior judgments that has

9

continuing prospective effect.
QUESTION:

10

I'm just curious, why can't the

11

Secretary of Education create a test case,

12

why couldn't --

3

GENERAL DELLINGER:

4

QUESTION:

if -- I mean,

Because he believes --

-- exactly what you said,

the laws

5

change in our opinion and therefore we think in this

6

partic -- you know, deliberately do it in order to raise

7

the issue in a different --

8
9

GENERAL DELLINGER:
question, Justice Breyer.

That is a fair enough

I believe that the Office of

20

Legal Counsel's proper response would be,

21

the law to have changed since Aguilar, we do not believe

22

that the Secretary of Education any more than a district

23

court judge should go directly in the teeth of a decision

24

of this Court which this Court has not itself overturned.

25

In fact,

I think -12

though we read

1

QUESTION:

Well, that's part of the problem,

2

General Dellinger, really, because we're reviewing, are

3

we, an action by the district court judge?

4

GENERAL DELLINGER:

5

QUESTION:

6

GENERAL DELLINGER:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, you are.

Under 60(b)?
Yes.

And we have to find that that judge

8

abused discretion in refusing the 60(b) reopening, and yet

9

that judge could look at Aguilar and say, I just don't

10

have room to do that.

11

How am I supposed to reopen this case?

12

That's the Supreme Court's holding.

How do we deal with that?

GENERAL DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

5

I mean, it isn't as though it's

coming directly --

GENERAL DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

GENERAL DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

20

Justice Ginsburg --

Yes -- no --

--to this Court -No.

That is correct.

We're reviewing the action of the

district court, so --

21

GENERAL DELLINGER:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So what standard do we apply there?

23

How did the district court abuse its discretion in saying,

24

boy, it isn't up to me?

25

GENERAL DELLINGER:

You approach that exactly as

you do a case in which you're up on a preliminary

2

injunction but the question is a rule of law, and this

3

Court has held that the abuse of power general standard,

4

which is a discretionary standard for the orderly

5

administration of justice, cannot force this Court into

6

making an erroneous decision of law just because a

7

district court on a preliminary injunction or in this

8

context or in any other got it wrong as a matter of law.

9

QUESTION:

General Dellinger --

10

QUESTION:

Well, but the focus -- the focus, it

11

seems to me, of Justice O'Connor's question is, what do

12

you tell the district judge -- if you're the law clerk for

13

the district judge, or the counselor to the district

14

judge, one of the attorneys, what do you tell him he

15

should do in this case?

16

It seems a little strange to say he abused his

17

discretion by following the law.

18

know that abuse of discretion is sometimes a too-onerous

19

word to describe what the -- phrase to describe what the

20

judge has done.

On the other hand, we

He's made a mistake of law.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Justice Souter, you -- I'm

22

sorry, Justice Kennedy, you inform the district judge as

23

he anticipated in this case, that the rule of law he was

24

required to apply is not what this Court believes is

25

currently the rule of law.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

He has no authority to

If he followed that by

ruling and not applying Aguilar you're exactly correct,

and we told the district judge that.
QUESTION:

12

3

The district judge and the court of

appeals both said, I think quite correctly --

4

GENERAL DELLINGER:

5

QUESTION:

Right.

-- that they -- there was nothing

6

that they could do, so if we're going to be candid about

7

what's involved here, isn't it really a request for

8

rehearing by this Court, and the 60(b) is just a passÂ­

9

through, because stage

20

and stage 2 cannot do anything

but reject the application?

Milwaukee or wherever would be just as bound by Aguilar v.

New York, and would come up --

QUESTION:

And the school district could appeal

6

the denial of the order that it wanted, and this Court

could rule on it without, in effect, granting a rehearing

That is --

QUESTION:

That's the way the law gets

changed --

15

GENERAL DELLINGER:

I would not say that this is

16

in effect a rehearing, because it is quite useful to have

17

the screening mechanism of district courts.

18

QUESTION:

Here --

Well, it may be useful, but I don't

19

see on your principle why any losing litigant subject to a

20

continuing order cannot come in at any subsequent time so

21

long as that order remains pending and say, perhaps for

22

very good reason, I would like another shot at arguing the

23

law.

24
25

GENERAL DELLINGER:

The reason is, Rule 11

sanctions, if there's no predicate for it.

(800) FOR DEPO

The reason --

1

QUESTION:

Why should there be a Rule 11

2

sanction if this is allowed?

3

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Because, Justice Souter,

4

what this permits is a party who has got a basis for

5

believing that an injunction which has continuing effect

6

no longer reflects the law or the Constitution to seek to

7

have that injunction lifted.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

I think it would raise --

Do you rely on the fact that this is

a continuing injunction?

Does that somehow enter into the

calculus and make your response different?
GENERAL DELLINGER:

11

Justice O'Connor, it is

12

critical to the calculus.

13

because it would raise a very serious question about the

14

role of courts and judges in a constitutional democracy

15

if a party did not have a way to be relieved from a court

16

order.

17

It is critical to the calculus

It is of course -QUESTION:

Why is that so?

Why shouldn't a

18

party have one opportunity to litigate the case and if

19

difficult for them to receive an education in public

The Establishment Clause, if it did require these

8

QUESTION:

I mean, what is your

response basically to Judge Friendly's opinion in Fenton?

9
10

Is it a change?

MR. CROTTY:

Well, my answer, Justice Breyer, is

that there has been a substantial change.
QUESTION:

11

What on the merits?

I mean, this

12

hasn't been -- the -- I found that a rather powerful

13

argument on the other side, Judge Friendly's opinion,

14

purely on the merits, leaving precedent and so forth out

of it, so if that's right in the front of your mind -- if

it's not, I'll ask more specifically, or -- but is that

Of course it will mean added expense.

interested in what your response to that is.

MR. CROTTY:

MR. CROTTY:

The answer, Your Honor, I believe

14

is that under the teaching not reflected in Judge

15

Friendly's decision, because it occurred subsequently and

16

in this Court, in Zobrest, where you had a child who was

17

handicapped, what the Court said was, when you have a

broad program of benefits that are available to everyone,

19

regardless of their religion, it can't be denied to that

20

particular child because he happens to be going to a

21

parochial school.

All right, so it's quite clear that a

breached, is it then logical that you could have science

2

taught for the lower third in the class, math, et cetera?

3
4

What Judge Friendly was worried about was
breaching a line.

5

MR. CROTTY:

Well, the line here, Your Honor,

6

is, unlike in paroch -- excuse me -- in public schools

7

under title I, where they have area-wide schools, where

8

enough of the population is in poverty they make the

9

entire school title I eligible and all kinds of things

happen, that's not available in the parochial schools.
Parochial schools only get a very thin slice.

constitutionally significant -QUESTION:

2

Well, the reason would be, I suppose

3

that the basic line is as to whether or not large numbers

4

of public school teachers are going to be physically in

5

the parochial school, and we have a whole list in the

6

opinion of problems that grow out of that.

7

MR. CROTTY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well -And now this Court's created an

exception to that, and the exception, I take it, is in the

situation where it's hardest for a child physically to

leave the school.

2

it's not all the children within that particular parochial

4

What I'm suggesting is that when you have a

narrow, well-defined program which can be monitored to

make sure that the concerns that Justice Friendly had,

Judge Friendly had are not really applicable -- we've had

MR. GELLER:

I think that assumption is a

much stronger than Chief Justice Burger did in Lemon, and

QUESTION:

Was it a question -- I don't

recall -- of action on a cert petition rather than a

18

decision on the merits?

19

recall that Gondack was a decision on the merits as this

20

was, with a sharply divided Court.

21

was a case involving a denial of a petition for review,

22

and then a rehearing on that denial.

That's not very comforting to

Is there any way that you think that this

8

particular entity, that New York City, which is under,

9

now, an injunction that it thinks does not comport with

10

what this Court has said the Constitution requires, is

11

there any way that New York could raise it, other than

12

60(b)?

I do not see it at this late date.

changed, that Zobrest now makes it clear that the

2

injunction was wrongly granted.

3

MR. GELLER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes -- yes -Is there no way that we can give

5

relief to New York, or to just tell them, well, wait for

6

somebody else to bring a lawsuit, maybe you'll get lucky?

7

MR. GELLER:

I was about to answer Justice

8

O'Connor's suggestion, and it will answer yours.

9

there was a way.

Sure

If -- if the law had really changed

10

here, and there was a change either in the law or the

11

factual circumstances, yes, under rules of equity you

12

might modify an injunction, perhaps even an injunction

13

that's a mandate on a constitutional point.

14

But look what happened here.

For 12 years after

15

this injunction issued, the Board of Education was faced

16

with the same cost and the same inefficiency, and they did

17

nothing about it until Kiryas Joel and the comments that

18

were made in Kiryas Joel about Aguilar, which don't have

19

the binding effect of law.

20

But if the law had really changed, and if the

21

factual circumstances had changed, yes, under rules of

22

equity that rule 60(b) subsumes these parties could

23

have -- the petitioners could have brought a case, but

24

they didn't do that, and the law didn't change.

25

As a matter of fact, we have pointed out that

1

the very comments in Kiryas Joel showed very clearly that

2

the law hadn't changed, and the comments were that Aguilar

3

perhaps should be overruled in a proper case, and we say

4

this is not a proper case.

5

QUESTION:

If we took the position that Zobrest

6

had in fact undermined Aguilar to the point that there was

7

nothing left of it, that it had in fact overruled it, even

8

though we did not say that in express terms, then I

9

suppose it would be proper for us to employ or to sanction

10

the employment of Rule 60(b) to grant the relief that they

11

want.

12

Do you agree?
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

Yes, if you had done that, if

13

the Court had done it in Zobrest, but I have to emphasize

14

how much respondents believe that Zobrest is

15

distinguishable from Aguilar and Grand Rapids and Meek,

16

and the extent of the aid that goes -- that flows to the

17

public school.

18

Of course, it ultimately flows --

And yet the type of aid that's given

here, doesn't it?

QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:

Well, the question, Your Honor, is,

13

did you apply -- did you adopt a principle that overrules

14

the cases in which the Court has held that -- it's

15

sometimes called massive aid, or funding of religious

16

schools, is unconstitutional as in Grand Rapids, as in

17

Meek v. Pittenger?

18

I don't think so, and the word that was used in

19

the Court's opinion in Zobrest was that the aid that was

20

given to that student was only attenuated aid.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

GENERAL DELLINGER:

The line that this Court has

itself drawn in Ball and in Zobrest is that a State may

not in effect subsidize the religious functions of the

7

parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of

8

their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.
