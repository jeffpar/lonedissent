ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN E. WALDROP, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALDROP:

9
10

please the Court:
There were 206,255 class members like

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

petitioners who had fraud claims for substantial money

3

damages as a result of Liberty National exchanging their

4

cancer policies in August of

5

986.

986, beginning in August of

The money damage claims of these plaintiff class

6

members were for fraudulently inflated premiums both as a

7

result of the new policy being more expensive and the

8

shifting of policyholders without their knowledge into

9

higher, more expensive age bands.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. Waldrop, you are here before the

21

Court asking this Court to decide a Federal due process

22

issue, and whether the Federal Constitution requires an

23

opt-out provision for plaintiffs in the class, is that

24

right?

25

MR. WALDROP:

Yes, that's correct.

1

And can you show us today or point to

raised by you before the Alabama supreme court?

Are you talking about the blue brief

in this Court or in the other court?

QUESTION:

3

And would they now be in the record

before this Court?

4

MR. WALDROP:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WALDROP:

Yes.

Okay, and can you tell us -If you start on page 21, and then

7

on page 23 of our brief we state that the minimum due

8

process requires that class members be given the right to

9

opt out, to exclude themselves from the class, and there

10

we begin talking about the decision of Shutts v. Phillips

11

Petroleum.
QUESTION:

12

Well, what were the questions that

13

you raised, the legal issues and the claims in the Alabama

14

supreme court?

I thought there were three.

15

MR. WALDROP:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WALDROP:

18

QUESTION:

Well --

You raised three issues.
Yes, we did.

And one of those issues was that

19

because there was no opt-out provision for the class it

20

violated the Alabama constitutional right to a jury trial.

21

MR. WALDROP:

22

Alabama supreme court.

23

25

QUESTION:

We did argue that before the

That was one issue that you

raised.
MR. WALDROP:

That was one issue.

1

QUESTION:

And there were two others, but

2

neither of them appeared to me on reading them to raise a

3

Federal due process violation like the failure to have an

4

opt-out provision.

5

MR. WALDROP:

Well, we felt like we raised it

6

with sufficient clarity, because, for example, the

7

respondents' brief, both class counsel in their very

8

first -- the class counsel raised it as one of their

9

statement of issues, and then, when you would look at

10

their brief, for example, in their summary of argument,

11

their very first page starts out by saying the mandatory

12

class and class action settlement on a no-opt-out basis

13

was proper and does not violate constitutional guarantees.

14

QUESTION:

All right, but we do know, I guess,

15

or will you concede that the Alabama supreme court did not

16

address this issue.

17

MR. WALDROP:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WALDROP:

20

QUESTION:

Did it or did it not?

21

QUESTION:

You can answer that yes or no and

22

23
24
25

Well --

Do you, yes or no?
Well, they --

then explain.
QUESTION:

You can say that and then explain

what you would like to explain.
MR. WALDROP:

No, the Alabama supreme court did

1

not directly address the no-out, opt-out issue in regard

2

to due process.

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. WALDROP:

They did cite the Shutts opinion,

5

but they cited it merely for the fact that a class action

6

was a type of joinder.

7

compelling clarity because class counsel responded to it

8

for some 20 pages in their brief.

9

responded to it for some 29 pages in their brief.

We felt like it was raised with

The Liberty National
So we

10

felt like the issue was in fact thoroughly briefed to the

11

Alabama supreme court, and they chose not to address it.

12

3
4

QUESTION:

And you did not raise it in any of

your claimed issues before that court.
MR. WALDROP:

Well, we felt that we did because

5

of our subheading on page 23 of our brief, when we stated

6

that minimum due process required the right to opt out.

7

20

QUESTION:

So you refer us now to pages 2

and

23 of your brief to the Alabama supreme court.
MR. WALDROP:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Twenty-one --

Was your brief that specific?

When

21

you recharacterized what was in it a moment ago I thought

22

you said that you had claimed in there that the lack of

23

opt-out did not violate any constitutional provision, and

24

now you refer specifically to due process.

25

the brief that it does not violate Fourteenth Amendment

Did you say in

due process?

2

MR. WALDROP:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WALDROP:

Well, what we said --

Well, were you that explicit?
Well, we were explicit in saying

5

it violated due process in citing the Shutts v. Phillips

6

Petroleum case.

7
8

QUESTION:

No, did you expressly say, the lack

of the opt-out does not violate Fourteenth Amendment due
process?

I mean, was that statement contained --

10

MR. WALDROP:

11

QUESTION:

--in page 23?

12

QUESTION:

I guess your position was that it

13

would violate it.

14

MR. WALDROP:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Well --

Exactly.

Or vice versa.

Did you state that

explicitly in your brief?
MR. WALDROP:

Well, we stated it in our head

18

note, Justice Souter, when we said minimum due process

1

requires an opt-out, and then we were discussing --

20

QUESTION:

But I mean, that -- all I want to

21

know is that statement, minimum due process requires an

22

opt-out, was in your brief?

23

MR. WALDROP:

24

QUESTION:

Okay.

25

QUESTION:

But it was in the brief consistently

Yes.

on pages 23 and 24, referring to the jurisdictional right

2

of a plaintiff who is absent from the State.

3

argument you're making here?

4

quite a different argument.

6

MR. WALDROP:

Is that the

I thought you were making

Well, we're making the argument

here that Shutts requires an opt-out.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but you never raised that point.

8

That is to say, as I read every single sentence on pages

9

23 and 24 and 25, which I have in front of me, every time

10

that you refer to it you talk about the rights.

11

in Shutts the trial court asserted jurisdiction over

nonresident class members in a class suit.

14

You say,

Then you quote

Then you go on to talk about, this action does

15

not provide absent class members the opportunity to remove

16

themselves.

17

the State wishes to bind an absent plaintiff, et cetera.

18

The U.S. Supreme Court similarly held that

And I can't find anywhere here the quite

19

different argument that you are now making, which I take

20

it is an interesting question, about whether people who

21

are within a State have a right to be opted out.

22

If you're making the argument about absent

23

plaintiffs, I guess it was decided in Shutts, and you're

24

certainly right about that one.

25

MR. WALDROP:

Well, two things, Justice Breyer.

1

First, the very last sentence we made on page 25, where we

2

state that the United States Supreme Court clearly held

3

that if a State wishes to bind an absent plaintiff, and

4

our term, absent plaintiff, we believe in Shutts means

5

residents and nonresidents.

6

QUESTION:

But it certainly didn't in Shutts.

7

MR. WALDROP:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we

8

believe that Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum does, in fact,

9

say that absent plaintiff in fact refers to residents and

10
11

nonresidents.
QUESTION:

But it doesn't say that in the brief,

12

and moreover, the clause you didn't quote says it's our

13

view that it has to provide minimal procedural due process

14

protection.

15

right to opt out, which is the point that you're making in

16

this section of the brief, so where in the brief do you

17

make the claim which you're now making that resident class

18

members have to be given the right to opt out?

19

It requires absent class members be given the

MR. WALDROP:

Well, our view is that on page 23,

20

when we said in our head note about minimum due process,

21

we were referring across the board.

22

QUESTION:

Is there a word in the brief anywhere

23

that says it's across the board?

24

MR. WALDROP:

25

Breyer, on page 23.

1

petitioners we have residents and nonresidents in our

2

group.

3

fact states that it applies to residents and nonresidents.

4

We believe that Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum in

QUESTION:

Well, let's just suppose that we

5

don't agree with you that it dealt with non-State

6

residents and furthermore that we conclude that the

7

question you want this Court to address on the Due Process

8

Clause and an opt-out requirement for residents of the

9

State was not cleanly presented by you below, and that the

10
11

Alabama supreme court did not address it.
Now, let's say we get that far in our analysis.

12

Is that failure jurisdictional or is it simply a

13

prudential concern we might have?

14

MR. WALDROP:

Well, we, of course, believe it

15

would be a prudential concern, because we believe that the

16

Alabama supreme court did not want to look at Shutts v.

17

Phillips Petroleum because in our situation we had

18

objectors who were nonresidents.

19

and if you -- the most narrow reading in Shutts would have

20

declared at the very least there would have been opt-out

21

rights granted to nonresidents.

If you look at Shutts,

22

For example, if I could refer you to the joint

23

appendix in volume 1, on page 238 and 239 you would see,

24

for example, at the trial court level there were notice of

25

opt-outs filed, for example, at the -- in the Barbour

3

behalf of Mississippi residents saying that the fraud had

4

occurred in Mississippi, and they were -- and the policies

5

were delivered in Mississippi.

There were also pleadings filed, for example on

So we believe that the reason that the Alabama

6

7

supreme court did not, in fact, want to look at Shutts

8

even in the most narrow sense is because opt-out rights

9

would have surely had to be granted in that type of

10
11
12

3

situation.
QUESTION:

How many members of this class were

from out of Alabama?
MR. WALDROP:

Well, we have -- the objectors,

4

the petitioners are 543 people, and we have 30 petitioners

5

who are nonresidents.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WALDROP:

But you have 400,000 in the class.
That's correct, and -- well, as

8

far as being nonresidents, that particular number was not

9

available to us, although we know that these policies were

20

sold in seven or eight States, so we know that the number

21

has to be in the ten of thousands of nonresidents, because

22

when the class was certified in Barbour County it was --

23

it covered all the States, and the problem was, that was

24

one of the problems in the Barbour County Circuit Court.

the other States.
Now, in regard to the type of money damages that

2

3

the absent plaintiffs have, in addition to the

4

fraudulently inflated premiums there were money damage

claims in this case for the denial of certain medical

actually went to a jury verdict.

The McAllister case was

then appealed to the Alabama supreme court, and it was

affirmed on appeal.

4

QUESTION:

And in any of the individual cases

5

that have been brought so far, have any of those sought

6

anything other than monetary relief?

QUESTION:

How about the two that were - - there

were two brought by class counsel.
MR. WALDROP:

Class counsel filed on behalf of

4

five individual clients, and in each one of those there

5

was a claim for money damages.

6

What we believe is -- in regard to Shutts, where

7

Shutts says that -- and when it establishes that an absent

8

plaintiff who has a claim for money damages is entitled to

9

the due process right of opt out, what we believe is this.

20

In trying to determine when there is a claim for

21

predominantly money damages, we believe that the test

22

should be three things.

23

First is, we believe that the Court should look

24

at the cause of action that is constitutionally protected.

25

In this case, it's a fraud cause of action.

When we look at that, as we do after

the fact in a case like this, should we bear in mind which

of the fraud damages can be satisfied out of these special

funds which have been set up?

8

MR. WALDROP:

Well, Justice Souter, these

special funds were declared to be punitive.

9

QUESTION:

Well, regardless of how they might

10

otherwise be characterized, and I want to hear what you

11

say, but is it at least a subject that we ought to look

12

to?

14

to look to is what was settled.

the claims that were stated and given up and not the terms

of the settlement.

Another plaintiff might say, well, I'd like to

have my insurance contract reformed so it will get rid of

the form -- fraud, and so the claim for fraud, it can be

14

regarded as neuter in that respect.

One individual might say, I've got a good common

law claim for money for fraud, and another one could say,

I like this contract, some things about it, so I just want

it to be reformed to get rid of the fraud.

MR. WALDROP:

12

QUESTION:

In particular.

Now, what is your response to the

13

argument from the other side that punitive damages are not

14

substantively anybody's entitlement, and it's really up to

15

the State to decide the conditions in which they may be

16

available, and if the State class action rules don't make

17

them available, that's certainly within the power of the

18

State to decide?

19

What is your response to that?

MR. WALDROP:

Well, Alabama law appears to us to

20

be in conflict.

Henderson v. Alabama Power Company, that

21

struck down a $250,000 legislative cap on punitive damages

22

because it violated the right to trial by jury under the

23

Alabama constitution, so they in fact said that the cause

of action was constitutionally protected.

Well --

Well --

It's just a question of State law

whether it be constitutional or statutory?
MR. WALDROP:

Well, no, sir, Justice Souter.

I

10

believe that once you're given the cause of action and

11

it's vested, as in this case, then you are entitled to due

Who is it vested in?

MR. WALDROP:

It may be taken away from --

You were just talking about the

16

punitive side of it.

17

that every member of the class relinquished that, but the

18

punitive, you were about to say, I think, that there's

19

something else going on in Alabama, that there's some --

from the courts coming -- that not all 400,000 people are

going to get a million dollars punitive damages.

award they could take half of it away and give it to the

2

State, and so I really think Alabama law there is saying

3

that constitutionally you have the cause of action, and

4

it's discretionary with the jury as to whether or not you

5

can -- whether or not you get punitive damages.
But once you get the award, it can be taken

away.
QUESTION:

Well, I wish I knew more about

Alabama law, and one reason I don't is because the Alabama

10

court never addressed any of this stuff.

Any -- I mean,

11

you know,

12

Even if it is, as you say, prudential, and I guess that

13

depends on the terms of the 1257(a) --

I'm coming back to the jurisdictional point.

14

MR. WALDROP:

15

QUESTION:

Well --- which requires that the issue --

16

final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court

17

of a State in which a decision could be had may be

18

reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where

19

the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in

question on the ground of its being repugnant, and I guess

21

that -- the issue is whether that means is drawn in

question here in the petition for cert, or was drawn in

question in the State court.

MR. WALDROP:

QUESTION:

Well, yes.

Justice Scalia --

Let's assume it means in the State

court, and therefore let's assume that our cases that have

4

dismissed some of these cases are all based on

5

discretionary judgments.
Why isn't a valid basis for answering that

6

7

discretion that I have no idea what the State courts think

8

of these issues that you're raising, and they might have

9

interpreted their State statute differently had they seen

10

these issues, had they addressed them, and had they seen

11

Federal constitutional problems?
Isn't that a good prudential reason for us not

12

13

to jump into the mess?

14

MR. WALDROP:

No, sir, because we felt that this

15

issue was, in fact --we had been raising the opt-out from

16

the very beginning.

17

QUESTION:

I think Justice Scalia's question is,

18

assuming that we were to decide that you did not properly

19

raise it, and the question then is, is it jurisdictional

20

so we must dismiss this petition, or is it prudential, and

21

he says is it a good prudential reason that you did fail

to raise the question before the supreme court of

1

I don't know what your answer is,

though.

you're making.

this as anything other than a money claim you're going to

run afoul of the United States Constitution in respect to

It's referring to -- there seem to be two claims
One is, Alabama court, if you characterize

I read that as what you

Then I found another claim on 21.

On 21 you

say, look, given these absent plaintiffs out there who

10

have a claim under Shutts for due process, don't, please,

11

characterize this as if it were nonmoney.

12

Now, maybe that's the same argument, or maybe

13

it's two, but I don't see anything at all, not a word,

14

that seeks to generalize the Shutts claim to the problem

15

of the resident non -- plaintiff, which is a totally

different problem, or quite a different problem.

say is that we felt like, starting on page 21, that we had

24
25

It is absolutely true that we argued the right

strongly, because that is something that they look at.

2

felt that the Alabama supreme court would be much more

3

interested in that issue, but we did, in fact, raise the

4

no-opt-out, and we felt that we had raised that issue.

5

We --

6

QUESTION:

We

May I ask you one question on the

7

merits, which I -- which I -- how we get to this.

8

-- is this your view -- I'm trying to understand how this

9

works, but suppose that we have a defendant who is being

It just

10

asked by different groups of plaintiffs to do inconsistent

11

things, the classic case where you don't get an opt-out,

12

and each of those plaintiffs adds a clause to his

3

complaint saying, in addition I'd like punitive damages.

4

What's supposed to happen then?

5

In your view, is the addition of the words

6

punitive damages -- if you go to each of the plaintiffs,

7

by the way, and say is it important to you, they say, sure

8

is.

9

It might be a lot of money.
So is the simple addition of the word, punitive

20

damages to a class action that plainly is not an opt-out

21

class suddenly converted, making it an opt-out class, or

22

making it a no-opt-out class?

23

MR. WALDROP:

Well, yes, and for this reason in

24

Alabama it would be an unliquidated claim, and it would --

25

that would be the case everywhere, but secondly in Alabama

if the settlement fund in the class was sufficient to

2

punish the defendant, then opting out would serve you no

good under Green Oil v. Hornsby, because if you opted out,

4

if there was already a sufficient fund, the Green Oil

5

curtain would come down in Alabama.
So we believe that under Alabama law that

14

State, have some sense that you don't punish the same

case law?

17

MR. WALDROP:

You want to have a

Is there none of that in Alabama

There is in Green Oil v. Hornsby.

18

One of the things that you look at is successive punitive

19

damage awards.

20

In this particular case, for example, in the

21

settlement 99.9 percent of the absent plaintiffs don't

22

share in the funds for punitive damages.

23

make the argument about punitive damages, but in this case

24

99 percent of them are not going to share at all in

25

anything to do with punitive damages.

The respondents

They traded their

1

punitive damages claims for nothing.
So in this case opting out in regard to punitive

2

3

damages would clearly be the thing to do, because they

4

were traded for nothing, and so that is the reason in this

5

particular case that, as we say, they all had money

damages, compensatory, they had money damages, punitive

damages.

QUESTION:

I take it under their rules they're

free to go ahead and address it if they see a Federal

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, which I think

19

partly explains the reason it was in the respondent's

20

briefs before the Alabama supreme court, because it was

21

decided by the trial court in Alabama, and since we went

22

ahead and addressed it because it certainly could have

23

been addressed by the Alabama supreme court, but that

doesn't cure the appellant's failure to raise it properly

Randell.

9

I thought it was

More recent opinions have said that it's

10

unsettled, it may be prudential, and the Court's been

11

careful not to decide that question, usually saying the

12

prudential reasons are sufficient for us not to find a

13

waiver, and we think that's the case here as well.

14

The most obvious one is the federalism concerns.

15

If this Court were to address the Federal due process

issue without the Alabama supreme court having been

17

afforded an opportunity to do so, it will be reversing a

State judgment when, for example, the Alabama supreme

in the brief in opposition frankly induces me to say that

3

as a prudential matter, if we're going to be serious about

our demands that these issues be presented in the BIO and

MR. ROBERTS:

I

It's -- well, it's also a concern

4

for this Court in its decisional processes just to make

5

sure another reason, prudential, for having a requirement

6

that the issue be raised is that a full record be

7

developed on that.
We don't have that here.

8

9

There are a lot of

issues in which there's disagreement about the record, a

10

lot of things we don't know about with respect to some of

11

these particular issues because it wasn't raised below.

think that's a concern that the Court ought to weigh at

least as heavily as incentives to encourage the filings of

proper briefs.

I

MR. ROBERTS:

It was raised at the trial level,

rule, and the claim has evolved or changed as it's

developed.
To the extent it now focuses on nonresidents, we

22

don't know who the nonresidents are from the record.

don't know what their contacts with the State of Alabama

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, at least as the question

5

was presented to this Court, and I think as Mr. Waldrop

6

stated it in Court this morning, they are not raising opt

7

out just for nonresidents.

8

their question presented in their cert petition was that

I thought the statement of

opt out is the right of any class member where the relief
10
11

relinquished is money damages.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

I agree that that is the

12

question before this Court.

13

and in their main brief as well they seem to also be

14

arguing rights of nonresidents, questions I don't think

are before the Court, again issues that could have been

First of all, Crowell v.

Randell and then the recodification of that statute after

assumption that it contains within it a decision on an

Now, if it does not because the highest court in

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, do you think Michigan v.

No, I don't.

That's in terms of

but here we don't have that.

So you'd say if Michigan v. Long is

about what the Alabama supreme court decided Michigan v.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the State courts, of course,

2

can always address the question in another case, the next

case that comes along.

8

you may with respect to one of the Federal circuit courts.

9

QUESTION:

I don't think you understood Justice

10

Kennedy's point.

I think he's saying that our GVR

11

practice assumes that we have jurisdiction when we remand

12

for the State court to consider a Federal question that it

13

didn't consider, but if this is a jurisdictional statute,

the fact that the State court didn't consider it means

that we don't have the case in front of us.

I'm not familiar precisely with

they apply in the State court system as well as with

there, Mr. Roberts, at least in Newsom v. Smyth which you

MR. ROBERTS:

And it is -- and it was expressly-

Correct.
My point is simply that one, we

think it's jurisdictional for the -- at least for the

10

reasons given by Justice Story, and if not, the prudential

11

reasons cut strongly against deciding a Federal

12

Constitution, particularly concerning the validity of

State court rules, when the State supreme court has not

had an opportunity to address that question.

15

Turning to the merits, petitioners' property

interest, their choses in action, typically may be

17

resolved in an individual lawsuit brought at a time and

18

19

Federal Constitution prevents a State for good and

20

sufficient reasons from providing that in certain

21

circumstances they must be resolved in a different manner

22

through another remedial mechanism.

whether the procedural protections provided in that

There -- none going forward now.

There was one, the Peel suit, where the plaintiff refused

The reason these people took out cancer

Yes, and the point I want to

18

emphasize is that here, as far as procedural due process

19

goes they had notice and opportunity to be heard, and the

20

complementary protections of the class action rules.
QUESTION:

21

And you would say, Mr. Roberts, that

22

the State could abolish that cause of action for fraud not

23

only by legislation but by judicial decision if it chooses

24

to operate that way, and that that wouldn't violate due

25

process.

Alabama, since it seems to try to follow Federal Rule 23,

again a reason that --

shouldn't reach out and decide the issue, because we don't

know how they would have addressed it in this instance

I think your question highlights
a prudential reason the Court

There were two different regimes at issue here.

Petitioner's view, even though its choses in action were

21

shared by 400,000 other people, that each one has a right

22

to an individual lawsuit even though the courts found it

would lead to a race of the courthouse, windfalls for a

few, and nothing for the vast majority, or the rule that

mandatory treatment are met we're going to bring everybody

together, we're going to resolve all the claims in this

individual notice and opportunity to object, and only have

this issue come up after we've determined that they're

adequately represented in a class action.

I think it's the former system that is subject

to a serious due process challenge, not the latter one

that Alabama adopted and that the Alabama supreme court

10

affirmed in this case.

Thank you.

Mr. Waldrop, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN E. WALDROP, JR.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. WALDROP:

Well, we believe that a cause of

17

action, a fraud cause of action, this Court had already

18

said in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank back in 1950 that

19

a cause of action is a constitutionally protected right.

20

In -- so in this case, once -- and under Alabama law once

21

you have --a cause of action for fraud is vested, it

22

cannot be taken away.

23

Secondly, this settlement perpetuated the fraud,

24

because the various class members had to continue to pay

25

premiums if they were to get any benefit out of the

1

settlement at all.
Lastly, in regard to Shutts, we believe that if

2

3

Shutts in fact was only a territorial jurisdictional case,

4

which we believe that it was not, we believe that

5

fundamentally it should apply across the board for two

6

reasons.

7

One, there's no fundamental difference between a

8

nonresident and a resident.

If you're going to put them

9

together for money damages on the front end for

10

certification -- that is, they have the same unity,

11

cohesiveness, typicality, and commonality on the front

12

end -- then on the back end you can't make a difference as

3

to whether they should have a right to opt out or not,

4

because that would be arbitrary if you're going to put

5

them together on the front end in regard to money damages.

6

Secondly, in regard to Rule (c)(2) of the

7

Federal rules as well as the Alabama rules, in regard to

8

(b)(3) actions, which are normal money damages, it is a

9

mandatory notice that the -- that you have notice and

20

opportunity to be heard and the right to opt out.
The advisory comments to the Federal rule says

21
22

that that has constitutional underpinnings.
