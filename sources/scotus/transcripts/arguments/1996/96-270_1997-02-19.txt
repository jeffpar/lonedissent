ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We're here today to contend that the Third

11
12

Circuit was in error when it held that Rule 23 must be

13

applied with a blind eye toward the settlement reached in

14

this case.

15

In colorful language, the Third Circuit accused

16

the district court and the proponents of the settlement of

17

crafting a legislative solution to the asbestos crisis.

18

In fact, it was the Third Circuit that fashioned a new

19

restriction on class actions that has no basis in the text

20

of Rule 23.

21

The court declared broadly that Rule 23 must be

22

applied without reference to settlement, and that

23

settlement is an impermissible consideration, but the

24

Third Circuit cited nothing in Rule 23 that says that the

25

court lacks authority to consider settlement, and even

some of the respondents now concede that the settlement

Well, how about the limitations that

Yes, and that basically the rules

have to be rules of procedure in a contemplated lawsuit.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, this, of course, was a

12

lawsuit, but there is no requirement in Rule 23 that the

13

lawsuit has to be determined to be triable.

14

generic language about issues being in common, about

15

claims, but it doesn't say that the action has to be

16

determined to be triable before the case can be certified

17

for settlement and, indeed, we've had 30 years of practice

18

now in the various courts of appeals where class actions

like this -- I'm not aware that there has been, and

we could do much better on our own.

it doesn't affect substantive rights?

5

We have one group I think from California saying

MR. SHAPIRO:

How can you say that

These people, of course, have the

opportunity to opt out of the class.

6

QUESTION:

Well, that's a question.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

Did they?

Yes, we believe they did.

The

8

court found that they had been given notification that

9

satisfied due process standards and, indeed, it was one of

10

the most massive notifications in history.

11

thousand people received personal notifications through

12

the mail, some 6 million people received notifications

13

through union publications, there was television

14

programming that included this warning, there was targeted

15

newspaper coverage - -

QUESTION:

Seven hundred

Now that, what you're describing, may

17

fit a common fraud where each person is affected to a

18

small degree, but here you have a personal injury suit

19

where the normal rule is, I can go it alone, and when a

20

restriction is made on that and says no, you have to

21

travel with all these other people, I really don't

22

understand how that doesn't involve substantive rights.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, there have been

24

many cases, class action settlements, where injunctions

25

have been entered after the case was settled to prevent

splintering off, challenges to the class action

settlement, provided that due process is satisfied in

3

giving notification.

4

QUESTION:

Can you give me an example of a

5

personal injury lawsuit where 20 defendants are saved from

6

every court in the country continuing litigation?

7

I've seen that in the bankruptcy context, but I

8

don't know of it outside that --

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Agent Orange case is an

10

example like that, from the Second Circuit, where the

11

manufacturers settled with a nationwide class of veterans

12

from the Vietnam War, all of whom had been exposed.

13

had diseases, some did not, and the court protected that

14

settlement with injunctive orders that prohibited

15

relitigation of the issues settled in the class.
QUESTION:

17

Some

It enjoined every court in the

country, as this antisuit injunction did?
MR. SHAPIRO:

18

Well, it entered ancillary

19

injunctions against those that attempted to splinter off

20

and relitigate.
Ever since this Court's decision in Supreme

21

22

Tribe of Ben Hur v. Cobble it's been clear that if there's

23

a class action settlement that satisfies due process the

The

There are, of course, exceptions,

and - QUESTION:

And what about those exceptions?

Have they had due process?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Those persons do have due process,

because the rule requires the best notice practicable.

18

Those persons are protected by adequate representation - -

19

QUESTION:

That's assuming -- that's assuming

20

that you can -- maybe the problem of notice reflects on

21

the impropriety of proceeding in this case at all, as this

massive class action.

23

Maybe you see that there can't be such a class,

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, we submit that the

standards.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, let's start from the very --- there could be an exception for

such a person.
QUESTION:

Let's start from the very basic

15

premise, and you tell me if I'm wrong about this, but it

16

was my understanding that there is a right for one to

17

litigate one's own claim, and that's the basic rule, and

18

if that's going to be displaced, there has to be a good

19

reason for it, and that good reason, I assume, is not for

20

the courts to make up in the guise of procedure.

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there is a superiority

requirement which supplies the good reason.

that the court can and ought to look to in order to

think the rules allow you to do that.
MR. SHAPIRO:

2

Well, Justice Kennedy, this body

3

of litigation is unique in the sense that this is the most

4

mature body of mass tort litigation in the country.

5

There's 30 years of experience here in settling these

6

cases.

7

one can assign values to these categories with a great

8

deal of confidence.

The disease categories are very well-known, and

Many other cases don't fit that description, and

so the court would have a great deal of difficulty in - QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

Could New York City do what I

15

supposed?

16

than having -- spending a lot money on legal fees, from

17

many policy perspectives.

18

This is a much more intelligent way to proceed

MR. SHAPIRO:

There would be real difficulties

19

in doing that, because in slip-and-fall accidents the

20

variety of injuries and the variety of claims for harm are

21

not just three or four, as there are in this --

22

QUESTION:

Suppose it was comparable?

Suppose

23

that in fact you did have - - the water mains overflowed

about people who haven't had their exposures, haven't had

They've all fallen.

MR. SHAPIRO:

They've all --

QUESTION:

MR. SHAPIRO:

-- and various things will happen.
If there was an attempt to settle

17

in one proceeding all the past injury cases and you could

18

really find typical and adequate class representatives for

19

that huge array of injuries, it's not inconceivable, but

20

not many cases really are manageable in the sense that

21

this one is.

22

This one is truly unique because of the maturity

23

of the litigation.

There are only four disease categories

24

here, and people know with a great deal of certainty about

25

what value attaches to them.

We're talking about people

You do

You don't just look

But isn't the fairness of the

10

settlement swallowing -- isn't this sort of the point of

11

what the Third Circuit was saying, and that is that the

12

fairness inquiry in effect is swallowing all the preceding

13

steps that are normally assumed when the moment comes to

14

look at fairness?
Take this as an example.

15

If I understand what

16

the district court did, and if I understand what you're

17

arguing, you're saying there is no disparity of interest.

18

There is no conflict as within the various subclasses here

19

which should present -- which should prevent a

20

certification, and the reason for that is, here they all

21

are.

22

They've got the settlement, and they like it,

23

and yet -- and you say there really couldn't be any

24

unfairness -- or, I'm sorry, there really couldn't be any

25

true disparity of interest unless we were dealing with a

limited fund in which whatever A gets, B doesn't get.

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

3

QUESTION:

That's --

And yet it seems to me the reality is

4

that there is, in a way, a kind of limited fund unless you

5

assume that the defendants in these cases are simply

6

standing in court saying, we'll pay anything they want.

7

The sky is the limit.
If the sky is not the limit, then there really

8

9

is a conflict among these subclasses, and the only way it

10

seems to get around that conflict is to say, well, there

11

isn't one any more, because here they all are, and they

12

like what they're getting.
And isn't that the vise that the Third Circuit

13
14

was getting at, that your fairness inquiry after the fact

15

of settlement is displacing all of the criteria that

16

normally have to be applied in order to satisfy just

17

judicial standards before you even get to looking at

18

fairness?

concerned - -

20

Isn't that what the Third Circuit was

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's the critical issue, and

21

Professor Tribe has caricatured our position as amounting

22

to that, but it certainly is not our submission.

23

We don't think that the fairness inquiry wipes

24

out the other inquiries under Rule 23.

25

inquiry is still central.

QUESTION:

But we say

But the predominance --- as well as the --

The predominance --- of the parties.

The predominance inquiry, which is

central, I think, in (b)(3), certainly changes, and if you

10

look at this going in you'd say, my goodness, these are

11

people who are suffering from any number of diseases

12

accrued at different times involving different

13

manufacturers.

14

discrete claims, one could say that a common question

15

predominates.

There's no way that, looking at these as

You have different State laws involved,

California very generous, Maine less generous.

You look

18

at it and say, my goodness, this is just a hodge-podge, I

think was the word Judge Becker used.
So going in with a case, looking at the

telling this Court and also Congress that you couldn't

what it was meant for.

And then it suddenly gets changed to be
something so much vaster than was ever intended.

7
8

That's not

MR. SHAPIRO:

I was struck by the comment of the

Rules Committee current draft of the change in Rule 23
that said that our position is law everywhere in the

10

United States except in the Third Circuit.
Thirty-nine percent of all the cases that are

11

12

certified today are certified for settlement purposes

13

only.

This is really no change.

This is --

QUESTION:

Well --

QUESTION:

Well, but the -- I'm sorry.

16

QUESTION:

As I think most of the parties agree,

17

the Third Circuit spoke too extremely when it said you

18

can't take -- nobody says you can't take settlement into

1

account, you can't have a settlement class.

20

But what's key in this opinion, as I read it, is

21

that -- just what Justice Souter said, that 23(e) does not

22

swallow up everything that went before.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

We completely agree with that,

24

Justice Ginsburg, and when you look to these other factors

25

and you consider the settlement, it makes them so much

QUESTION:

Well, but let me suggest one change

4

in Judge Becker's opinion that I think would leave us

5

right where we are, but perhaps I'm wrong.
What if Judge Becker had said, look, the vise

6

7

here is that the settlement is being used as a sufficient

8

basis in and of itself to answer these various preceding

9

inquiries, to satisfy these various preceding conditions

10

for class certification.
If he had put in that word sufficiency, wouldn't

11
12

everything else in the Third Circuit's opinion basically

13

be just as appropriate, or inappropriate, as the case may

14

be, as it is the way the Third Circuit actually phrased

15

it?

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

I don't think the Third Circuit

17

could have modified the opinion that way, because Judge

18

Reed looked at a host of other things in addition to the

19

settlement.

20

He didn't look just to the settlement.

He looked to the alignment of the

21

representatives; he looked at their incentives; he looked

22

at the negotiation history to see if these conflicts were

23

reality or just fiction, and in that sense the inquiry is

24

really a much-improved inquiry.

representation, or if you're going to get typicality, if

3

you're going to get superiority.

4

QUESTION:

But you would in fact have a very

5

different inquiry, as you yourself argue, if there were

6

not already a settlement on the table and, in fact, there

7

is a good argument, as Justice Ginsburg just suggested,

8

for coming out quite differently depending on whether you

9

were looking at it before the settlement and after the

10

settlement.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

QUESTION:

Oh, absolutely --

And the question is one of degree,

13

and it seems to me the suggestion in her question and the

14

suggestion in mine is that the degree is so great that the

15

only way to make sense, I think, of the certification

16

which the district court made was by saying, the district

17

court was treating the settlement as sufficient as opposed

18

merely to one source of information.

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that would be a

20

mischaracterization of what Judge Reed did, because he

21

looked at a host of factors pertaining to the alignment

22

and the incentives and the vigor of the negotiation, the

23

changes that were made in this deal, whether or not the

24

AFL-CIO endorsed it -- he was looking to an entire array

25

of relevant facts.

QUESTION:

Well, I'll take that on, Mr. Shapiro.

2

Let's just talk about using the settlement as a

significant factor in deciding how broad the class can be.

I am concerned about the incentives that that

creates for the class action counsel.

Now, if he knows that by achieving a settlement

11

he can expand the size of the class on behalf of which

12

he's suing, will he not have an incentive to settle at

substantially less than he might otherwise settle?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

There --

Doesn't it place him in a real

16

conflict with regard to his clients in the class that

17

could get in without a settlement, in the class that would

18

be a certifiable class without the settlement?

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there are conflicts in cases

20

that have been certified for settlement and in cases that

21

are certified for trial, and the district courts have to

22

use the tools that are given them to examine, to see if

what was achieved was a vigorous, adversarial attempt to

maximize the amount of money from --

in other people who really wouldn't be in there if you

didn't have a settlement, but then you strike a settlement

that gives everybody less than they might get had he just

gone in without a settlement.

MR. SHAPIRO:

We have lots of indications here,

factual indications that that isn't true, and I suggest

this is a factual question where deferential review is

appropriate.

MR. SHAPIRO:

1

Your Honor, the transfer from Mr.

Fitzpatrick demonstrates that Judge Weiner asked for a

3

global resolution, wanted the parties to attend to that.

4

QUESTION:

Judge Weiner.

But did the

5

multidistrict panel say, when we're sending all these

6

cases to be consolidated for pretrial in the Eastern

7

District of Pennsylvania, that the court was to settle not

8

only those cases but cases that hadn't been instituted

9

yet?
MR. SHAPIRO:

10

They asked specifically that after

11

the transfer that the prospects for global negotiation be

12

considered, and that's just what the Federal Judicial

13

Center had said in two major conferences.

14

This was done at the instance of the judges who

QUESTION:

Do you have a reference to where the

that were consolidated?

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

The 1991 opinion itself does refer

21

to that as one of the possible outcomes of the transfers,

22

that perhaps a global settlement could be achieved in this

23

litigation, which is what the other judges had been

24

suggesting, too.

They told the lawyers, you've got to do better.

QUESTION:

We have many cases, and it's

sometimes a question of the degree of the difference

between substance and procedure, but it seems to me that

by using the term fairness the district court here

imported and made choices between substantive chances of

recovery, of liability, of measure of damages, and it

seems to me that that's not the intent of the rule, and

that it exceeds the authority of the courts under the

rule.

Well, if this --

Fairness becomes -- fairness, which

is an infinitely acceptable concept, is the basis for

MR. SHAPIRO:

If this were a litigated matter I

19

would agree with that, that you couldn't override State

20

law differences, but the parties can settle, and often do

21

settle in a way that varies from a particular body of

22

State law, and here the settlement does incorporate

23

reference to State law, but the amount of money is geared

in part to State law standards, but it's the settlement

that's critical.

Justice Kennedy, I do think that what the district court

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRIBE:

I just want to answer -Sure.
The fact that it's too big, too

4

diverse can't possibly be certified without, as Justice

5

Souter suggested, making the mere settlement somehow the

6

sufficient answer to all of the questions under Rule 23 is

7

a different matter.

8

The absence of a genuine controversy arises from

9

the fact that the entire case -- and this has never really

10

been denied -- was brought not to obtain the relief the

11

complaint requested, money for monitoring, money for mere

12

exposure, money for increased risk, it was brought solely

13

for the purpose of enabling the court, giving it

14

supposedly jurisdiction to issue a nationwide

15

injunction --

16

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish, then, the

17

cases that Mr. Shapiro cites which we read about in the

18

papers, and probably some are participating, where it is

19

announced that the Justice Department is bringing an

20

action and that X pleads nolo contendere, and that a

21

consent decree has been entered?

22

MR. TRIBE:

Well, the rights of third parties

23

are not sacrificed in those cases, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

What's happening is that the agency, the Department of

25

Justice, is saying that instead of taking you to court

and, if you insist, we will take you to court, we will

2

agree to desist from that if you will agree to --

3

QUESTION:

But the plaintiffs in the class

4

action are saying if you disagree we'll take you to court

5

just as much, aren't they?
MR. TRIBE:

6

There is this difference.

They can

7

only take the defendants to court with the defendants'

8

consent here, because in this case it is recognized that

9

this class could not be certified for litigation so that,

10

unlike litigable matters of the sort to which you referred

11

in which the plaintiff has some leverage, this is in the

12

unusual circumstance where, since absent the defendant's

13

agreement there's no settlement, and since absent a

14

settlement there could be no conceivable finding, even a

15

pretense of a finding that the Rule 23 factors are

16

satisfied, it means that the defendant really holds all

17

the cards.

18

It is not a case where the plaintiff has some

19

meaningful leverage and then they compromise and the court

20

in enforcing the compromise issues an injunction.

21

the injunction has the effect of replacing a system of

22

tort law that one might find fault with with an

23

administrative scheme.

24
25

The court would have had no power whatsoever to
do that ordinarily, and what Mr. Shapiro says is, the

reason it has power to do that here is because this is not

3

Well, of course, the only power that a Federal

motivating my question partly is the analogy to what I've

seen is a lot of settled cases in the civil rights area

-- what's obviously -- what's actually

10

where it seems to me the power to accept settlement is

11

fairly broad, and to extinguish State law claims, and I

12

grant you you're right that this is in the far -- pushing

13

that.

14

There's no question about that.
But the reason the district judge says that

15

they've gotten into this thing is that they're trying to

16

settle millions of claims, and the reason that they're

trying to do that, he says the victims are not receiving

These are millions of people who actually do have

Now, I take it that this is an effort to use

whether there isn't the power here to bring about what the

district court says he's aiming at.

If you look at the question presented in the

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

Third Circuit, of course, did not ignore the existence of

It went on at some length to show how the

There was no inflation adjustment, which

there's some rhetoric in Judge Becker's opinion that

suggests that the settlement doesn't matter, his own

holding makes clear that he looked at it, he paid

attention to it.

is clearly right, and very important.

QUESTION:
MR. TRIBE:

The settlement

Let me ask you, Mr. -It doesn't matter whether the

settlement looks reasonable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, may I just ask you, do you

agree with this sentence out of Judge Becker's opinion:
We held in GM Trucks that, although class

15

actions may be certified for settlement purposes only,

16

Rule 23(a)'s requirements must be satisfied as if the case

17

were going to be litigated.

18

Do you think that's a correct statement of law?

19

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice Stevens, I think when

20

he says, as if it were going to be litigated, if I

21

interpreted that to mean what Mr. Shapiro does, namely, we

22

must be blind to the settlement in figuring out whether

23

the criteria of Rule 23 are met, I think it would be

24

wrong, because things like management of a complex case

25

might shed a lot of light on that by looking at the
40

settlement, but you don't have to read it that way.
I would interpret that to mean that we must

2

3

avoid a search - - we must avoid looking at this as though

4

the questions were no longer those of typicality,

5

predominance, superiority, and adequate representation,

6

but merely the fairness of the settlement.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. TRIBE:

Well, does that mean that -And I think in that respect he's

right.
10

QUESTION:

Is it conceivable that there are

11

class actions that have come to the court in a settlement

12

posture which the trial court could say, well, if this

13

were going to be tried, I really couldn't prove the class

14

certification but, given the settlement, I think I will

15

approve it?

16

is that ever possible, in your view?

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice Stevens, I wanted to

17

be able to say yes to that because I thought I could come

18

up with managerial examples in which that would be

1

possible, but I think there are three reasons why the

20

answer really ought to be no, and they're very

21

fundamental.

22

They relate to the text of Rule 23 and whether

23

it can possibly be stretched to confer judicial power to

24

impose a binding order on an entire class where the class

25

representatives could not be deputized to litigate it, and

with Article III and due process problems.

2

say a word about each.

3

Let me just

As far as the text of the rule is concerned, it

4

talks constantly about circumstances in which people may

5

"sue as representative parties" and, most importantly,

6

there's no language in the rule that confers affirmative

7

power to impose a binding settlement on the class.

negative thing.

It's a

It says that you cannot

dismiss or compromise a class action without judicial

approval.

shape to infer from them a power to judicially impose a

13

settlement where you concede that there could not have

14

been a class action.

15

I think you have to twist those words out of

I also think that there's an intrinsic

16

Article III problem, just apart from the facts of this

17

case, in construing any rule of procedure to create

18

circumstances where an Article III court may bind

19

nonparties, but only so long as the parties who seek such

20

an order have settled all of the disputes between them and

21

have therefore put no controversy before the court.

22

I mean, that's what it would come down to.

It

23

would basically say the one precondition of getting the

court to exercise its judicial power is that you guys

don't disagree.

head.
I think there is a third problem, and it goes to

2

3

Justice Scalia's question about incentive structures.

4

mean, apart from the incentive to load up the class with

5

additional people, which may be bad for a number of

6

reasons, I think there's a fundamental point, and that is

7

that representative parties, as the rule calls them, who

8

conceivably cannot carry on adversary class litigation

9

against a defendant -- which is your hypothetical, Justice

I

10

Stevens, right? -- are necessarily hobbled inherently in

11

negotiating with that defendant and thereby playing the

12

role that due process and rule 23(a)(4) demands, namely,

13

fairly and adequately protecting the interests of the

14

class, because by definition -- by definition,

15

representative parties in that situation need the

16

defendant's cooperation to get the class off the ground at

17

all.

18

QUESTION:

Well, what about -- are you then --

19

is the implication of what you're saying that imagine a

20

big company, or several of them, that have a history of

21

employment discrimination, and they work out a settlement

22

that is going to cover millions of people into the future,

23

or toxic torts of all kinds -- you know, there are

24

thousands of them, and now it would be impermissible to

put anybody in the settlement class, anybody -- anybody

who might work for this company in the future, unless in

2

the absence of that settlement his position is similar

3

enough to the others in the class that he'd be in it

4

anyway.

5

That proposition of law seems to have, to me, a

6

lot of implications as to all kinds of decrees all over

7

the place in ways that would inhibit settlements that

8

might be highly desirable.

9

MR. TRIBE:

Justice Breyer, I don't think it's

10

an implication of my position that one apple of the wrong

11

flavor spoils the barrel.
QUESTION:

12

13

The question --

Well, no, but that apple would be out

of it.

14

MR. TRIBE:

15

QUESTION:

Well, maybe -You see, that apple would be out of

16

the class, and that apple being out of the class would

17

mean that the company wouldn't know what was going to

18

happen, and therefore, who knows?

19

Or, when you get to the point of enforcing the

20

decree, the company claims, oh, that's one of the apples,

21

or the apple says it's the apple.

22

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

Well -You see -- do you see the problem?

in the rule that makes it possible for a nonlitigable case

to give rise to a binding decree.

that the rule should be changed to make that possible.

back end opt-out would not save this class?

16

that's what you're saying.

17

MR. TRIBE:

I take it

I think because a back end opt-out,

18

Justice Ginsburg, would have to have preconditions that

19

the court would set.

20

other cases a back end opt-out helps a great deal on the

21

issue of notice, on the issue of meaningful choice, so

22

that, for example, the widow in this morning's case might

23

have been in a position to make certain decisions after

24

her husband died that she wasn't before.

from being a binding exercise of Federal judicial power,

2

otherwise - - I mean, if they didn't need that they would

3

include it in their inventory settlements that they

4

settled on the side at quite a premium, and therefore I

5

think that although the superiority determination under

6

23(b) might come out differently with a back end opt-out,

7

I don't think the Article III problem or the textual

8

problem would be solved, nor would the leverage problem.

9

That is, the fundamental problem of any deal,

10

even if it looks good or better because people don't have

11

to make the kinds of impossible choices that this

12

settlement imposes on them 30 years before they come down

13

with a terrible disease, even though it would be improved,

14

if it turns out to be the case that the heterogeneity of

15

class, or the inability of the representative plaintiffs

16

adequately to represent the whole class or anything else

17

brings the situation to the posture Justice Stevens put,

18

namely, but for the settlement I simply could not certify

19

this class, that gives such leverage to the defendant that

20

in effect you are handing to the adversary power over the

21

State law claims of absent members of this class in a way

22

that changes their substance, the substance of those State

23

law rights in violation of the Rules Enabling Act, and

24

also in a way that violates I think both Hansberry v. Lee

That is, the point about both your opinion, I

think, in Richards v. Jefferson County, Justice Stevens,

and Hansberry v. Lee many years earlier, was that the

people who speak, even in the negotiation process, as you

MR. TRIBE:

1

I think if they were all separately

represented in putting the deal together, I think that

sounds like a perfectly reasonable --

QUESTION:

And if he finds that they got the

5

same benefit that they would have gotten that way --

6

because the main difficulty that he foresaw was there

wasn't enough money to go around, and that's what creates

8

the major controversy, but here he found there was enough

money to go around.
MR. TRIBE:

10
11

Well, enough money to go around

suggests that there's some pie in the sky whose size --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TRIBE:

Right.
-- we know.

The fact is, if in your

14

hypothetical these 18 subclasses were all represented by

15

the same two guys, and not separately represented, I think

16

no one is smart enough to look at that and say, oh, I can

17

tell that even though their interests are in conflict,

18

they got as good a deal as they would have gotten

19

otherwise, because there isn't any as good a deal out

20

there.

21

The question is, there are a lot of different

22

ways of carving up this pie.

Maybe, as was suggested in

23

the earlier argument, the right thing is to reserve most

24

of the money for the people who get very, very sick, and

25

not to worry so much about medical monitoring, but that's

Somebody might say,

if they really were into

money for the medical monitoring so that less of them will

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

2

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

like to begin with the point Professor Tribe left, that

5

there's no proof of adequacy here.

6

voluminous evidence on adequacy of representation.

7

I'd

In fact, there was

The district court looked in great detail at

8

what these lawyers and what these class representatives

9

had done for each medical category.

This is a factual

10

issue, and the district court's determination on these

11

factual points is subject to deferential review.

12

Now, Professor Tribe's --

13

QUESTION:

I thought he was talking not about

14

adequacy of representation, but rather about the question

15

whether the settlement achieved gave each class the

16

maximum that it could have gotten.
MR. SHAPIRO:

17
18

And I think his point was you

can't just look at the end result.

19

QUESTION:

Right.

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

You have to look at other things.

21

We agree with that.

You don't just look at the end

22

result.

23

the representatives and the vigor of negotiation, the

24

changes that were made, and that's what the district court

25

did.

You have to look at the alignment of interests of

best positioned to consider.
QUESTION:

Do you think there would be any

3

difference if we were to hold hypothetically that there

4

had to be four lawyers, one for the people who brought

5

suit before, one for the people who have the disease

6

already, one for the people who have the thickening, and

7

one for the people who have nothing?

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

There --

Would that lead to a practical

difference in this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There's be no difference.

That's

12

what Judge Reed found, that there would be no -- there's

13

no practical need for these subclasses.

14

QUESTION:

So in other words, if this Court were

15

to say the thing that was wrong with this is that there

16

wasn't those four separate lawyers, and it went back, it

17

would reach the same result, in your view?

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the same result would be

19

reached at greater expense, because the district court

20

found here that there were no conflicts among these

21

subclasses.

22

QUESTION:

You're willing to leave it to one

23

district judge to decide nationwide what is fairness as to

24

all of these different plaintiffs, some who haven't gotten
