ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BIRNBAUM:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The Court this morning is confronted with a

12

ruling from the Second Circuit that is both unprecedented,

13

stands alone and is contrary to the common law and field

14

of precedent both before this Court and in most of the

15

common law courts of this country.

16

Circuit's decision is not reversed, it will greatly

17

exacerbate the asbestos litigation crisis we have in the

18

courts and will lead to the unpredictable and expansive,

19

unlimited liability that this Court was concerned about in

20

the Gottshall case.

21

23

Tort law is clear:

If the Second

you have to sustain an

injury before you can recover from a negligent defendant.

MS. BIRNBAUM:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. BIRNBAUM:

What --

We can't both be right.
Well, I'm not going to argue the

12

Georgene case on the standing issue.

There may be

13

different considerations with regard to standing.

14

also looking at this issue through the context of FELA, a

15

statute that provides that there must be an injury, and

16

has a jurisprudence that goes with it.

17

much broader.

You're

But it's still

18

We would say that a person who is merely exposed

19

and has no injury -- in this case, the record is clear, he

20

has no clinical evidence even of pleural plaques, pleural

21

injuries, he has no recognition, no determination by his

22

own physicians even of subcellular changes --

QUESTION:

The courts below relied on the

physical impact of the fibers going inside his lungs.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

But, first, there is no real

1

evidence of that except a hypothetical given by the expert

2

below.

3

subcellular injury, even if it existed, has been held over

4

and over again by most common law courts in this context

5

not to be an injury.

But besides that, the real issue here is

QUESTION:

6

Well, how do we deal with a physical

7

impact, does that constitute an injury, even if it's

8

slight?

9

MS. BIRNBAUM:

No.

I think that -- and I think

10

if you look at the courts -- the common law courts -- even

11

a court like Florida, which clearly adopts an impact test

12

by itself, not a zone of danger test -- which I think we

13

need to talk about - - that this Court has adopted a zone

14

of danger test, not an impact test -- if you look at those

15

courts that have adopted an impact test, in the area of

16

asbestos exposure, toxic exposure, what the courts have

17

done is added more, because they are concerned about this

18

unlimited, unpredictable liability.

19

In Florida, where they have just the impact

20

test, the court, in the Cox case, said you have to also

21

have a physical injury.

22

QUESTION:

But aren't there many jurisdictions

23

that have recognized a claim for medical monitoring, a

24

common law claim for medical monitoring, for people who

25

have been massively exposed but have not yet manifested

MS. BIRNBAUM:

There are -- there are a few.

And it's -QUESTION:

4
5

There are --

How many, roughly, would you say?

Over a dozen I think.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

6

A little less, but there are

7

some.

And if you look at most of those cases, they are

8

either in the area where there are a very small number of

9

people -- the water cases, where there are just a small

10

number of people who have been exposed to contaminated

11

water, and not the kind of situation here, where 21

12

million people have been substantially exposed to

13

asbestos.

Twenty-one million people could come into the

QUESTION:

15

Yes, but may I interrupt with just a

16

question?

Let's talk about one of those 21 million people

17

who has been substantially exposed.

18

doctor says the exposure is sufficiently serious that I

19

think you ought to check with me every 6 months to see if

20

anything has developed, because if it does develop and we

21

catch it early, we'll be better able to treat you.

that be an injury?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

No.

I agree with that.

months for the next 10 years.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

I would say that under tort law

said.

Damage.

It's damage.

If we sustain -QUESTION:

But under general -- under general

tort law, you wouldn't make that argument, would you?

13

MS. BIRNBAUM:

14

QUESTION:

Yes,

I would. Your Honor.

You -- you would not -- I mean, but

15

your argument seems to be saying that you - - that there is

16

no injury cognizable in tort which does not involve

17

personal as opposed to economic injury.

18

you're not arguing that?

19

MS. BIRNBAUM:

20

QUESTION:

No.

No.

And that --

There --

But why isn't there,

then, an

21

economic injury,

just as Justice Stevens says?

22

if the doctor says the exposure is such that you would be

crazy not to have an examination every 6 months, why --

act reasonably and you're going to have the exam -- why

If the --

1

doesn't the reasonable necessity of expending the money

2

for the examinations every 6 months constitute an economic

3

injury to you?

4

MS. BIRNBAUM:

It -- it maybe a damage to you,

5

but before you can get to a damage for medical monitoring

6

-- for future medical monitoring, the courts -- the common

7

law courts have been very clear -- you first have to have

8

an injury.

QUESTION:
the other way?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

11
12

Yes.

And that is -- that is so.

There is

Except for the 12 that you said go

QUESTION:

But why should we not accept economic

inj ury?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Because if you do that, you will

be opening up the courts of this country to the -- to --

to - -

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

But that's a different --

19

you're -- it seems to me you're now saying -- and I'm not

20

saying it's an illegitimate argument -- but you're making

21

a different kind of argument.

22

would be, in the abstract, foolish to regard this as an

23

economic injury or economic damage, but if you do, you're

24

simply going to cost the system more than the system can

25

bear.

You're saying not that it

for reasons of the cost of consequences, we shouldn't

2

recognize it.

3

That's the argument you're making now.

MS. BIRNBAUM:

I -- that is the second argument.

4

I would go back to the first argument, and except for the

5

small number of cases in the water situation, not an

6

asbestos exposure, where there has been no physical

7

injury, the courts have not jumped in to provide a medical

monitoring kind of

than the population at large.

at these two people and say, who should bear the cost of

that something that the medical profession says should be

17

done, we would certainly put it on, would we not, the

person who caused the exposure rather than the person who

19

suffered the condition that requires the monitoring?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Because something

No illness is manifested yet.

And if we just were looking

I -- I think that the tort law

21

does not -- does not respond that way, except for these

22

special circumstances, these minority group of cases --

Then are you saying that we have a

kind of assumption of the risk involved, that the worker

from that injury, including foreseeable medical expenses

in the future.

with a different solution -- but it is a damage.

If there is an

That something would be a physical

Well, Ms. Birnbaum, in the case just

13

preceding, we were discussing the product liability law.

14

Certainly that has evolved often in conscious

15

consideration of which party can best protect against an

16

injury.

17

transactional costs are a permissible consideration in

18

deciding what recovery you can have under FELA?

19

I take it what you're arguing is that

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Yes, I think -- I think it is,

The statute is explicit -- you have to have an injury.

And there is no case under FELA that has ever

QUESTION:

7

Well, but we have recognized that

8

emotional injury will suffice for recovery if the person

meets the zone of danger test.

10

MS. BIRNBAUM:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes.

That is exactly right.

And this is a case based on emotional

inj ury.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

13

Well, it's based on emotional

injury, but he is not trying to recover medical monitoring

for his emotional injury.

He's trying to recover medical

Well, is his theory that if he has

regular monitoring, it will alleviate -- medical

20

monitoring -- it will alleviate his emotional concern?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

That was never argued below.

And

22

a jury would be giving him his emotional distress injury

not for any period of time until he had the first checkup.

Clear, but irrelevant.
It's not totally irrelevant, but

it doesn't matter --

13

QUESTION:

Well, why is it not --

14

MS. BIRNBAUM:

-- because today, also, there

exposure is severe, the added risk is severe, and there is

But are you -- are you -- but that's

11

still an effort to create a set of cases where the risk is

12

serious enough, such that, given the seriousness of the

13

risk, the level of the exposure and the medical need for

examinations, you have a cause of action and can recover.

QUESTION:

2

Ms. Birnbaum, you're talking about

3

FELA as though it were some kind of very restrictive

4

statute.

5

I went to law school, it was the most forward-looking and

6

the most -- they stretched the boundaries of everything.

7

Causation was stretched to the breaking point under FELA.

8

And has now it become some kind of a constricted statute?

9

But at least as I remember in ancient days, when

MS. BIRNBAUM:

No.

I think it is a broad

10

remedial statute.

11

and causation.

12

it clear that there have to be bright lines, especially in

13

the area of negligent infliction of emotional distress, to

14

prevent the kind of unpredictable and unlimited liability

15

that will occur if the Second Circuit's decision is

16

affirmed.

17

And it has broadly looked at defenses

But I think this Court, in Gottshall, made

Look what we have here.

We have a person who

18

has no injury, who has no serious emotional distress.

is worried and angry.

Well, he may have a good right to

of you on this Court that will like to look at 1908 and

decide that what was the common law in 1908 should govern.

There are those of you who don't believe that, and you're

going to look at the common law as it has developed.

10

I would suggest to you that the overwhelming

common law -- all of the common law in 1908 -- and the

MR. GOETSCH:

It doesn't sound significant,

20

The record in this case establishes that that is a 10 to

QUESTION:

Counsel, just to refresh your

rule is that your client may only have one bite at the

MR. GOETSCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is the

invasion of that legally protected interest.
QUESTION:

5

So then you really could have brought

6

two suits; you could bring just emotional distress, go the

jury on that, and then you could again bring a cause of

action for medical monitoring?
MR. GOETSCH:

9

I don't believe so for this

10

reason, Justice Kennedy.

11

monitoring claim is proof of exposure, increased risk and

12

a medically verifiable basis for exams that detect and

13

treat that increased risk of future cancer.

The basis for a medical
