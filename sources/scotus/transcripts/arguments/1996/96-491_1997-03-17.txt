ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. SCHWARTZ

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The railroad workers who are the petitioner in

13

this case have been denied their day in court by the

14

dismissal of their petition in the district court.

15

case pleaded -- presented today pleaded a unique,

16

egregious conspiracy to deprive a particular group of

17

employees of their welfare plan benefits.

18

pleaded specific intent to commit acts prohibited by

19

section 510 of ERISA.

20

This

They have

They have pleaded and their case involves the

21

use of deceit leading to coercion used to implement this

22

sham transaction.

23

within the congressional intent in the enactment of

24

section 510.

25

The conduct pleaded fits squarely

The railroad workers here have pleaded a

conspiracy to interfere with the specificity sufficient to

2

comply even with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil

3

Procedure.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Schwartz,

is it true that this

5

employer could not use the change route that you say could

6

have been used to accomplish this purpose?

7

benefits do not vest.

8

amended to reduce them.

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Therefore,

That is,

these

the plan could be

The benefits could be terminated.
Justice Ginsburg,

these benefits

10

were contractually vested as part of a Nation-wide

11

multiemployer bargaining pattern with the Teamsters Union.
QUESTION:

12

13

That -- so you are -- the answer to

my question is there was no amendment route here - -

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

15

QUESTION:

No.

-- because it was a multiemployer

16

plan.

Therefore, suppose an employer wants to accomplish

17

that objective just as a matter of cutting costs.

18

saying it's impossible.

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

You're

It would be possible only if they

20

were willing and able to go back and bargain for a change

21

in the contractually agreed benefits and then, pursuant to

22

that, make the necessary --

23

QUESTION:

But the same thing that you are

24

calling a conspiracy and - - could have been done were this

25

only a single employer plan as distinguished from a

multiemployer plan.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I do not believe that's correct,

3

because we're still dealing with the element of the

4

contractual vesting of the benefits, Justice Ginsburg.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Schwartz, some of us are having

6

difficulty in hearing you.

7

little more?

MR. SCHWARTZ:
will attempt to.

I wonder,

could you speak up a

Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,

I --

QUESTION:

Now,

if there were no union agreement

11

the law clearly allows the employer to just get rid of

12

these welfare benefits under the plan.

13
14
15

I

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Is that true?

Provided that there is

appropriate compliance with the amendment procedures, yes.
QUESTION:

Right, and the problem here is that

16

there is a union agreement under which the - - under the

17

terms of which the employer must provide these benefits.

18

Is that the problem?

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's certainly an element in

20

our contention,

21

about doing this had they not resorted to this subterfuge.

22

that they could not legally have gone

QUESTION:

Well,

they could have legally done it

23

for purposes of the ERISA statute, but in so doing, would

24

have violated the union agreement.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

They would have run afoul -5

1

QUESTION:

Is that right?

2

MR. SCHWARTZ:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, then you're saying in effect

4

that they could do in a

-- with a single employer plan,

5

no contrary collective bargaining agreement, they could do

6

in two steps what you're saying they can't do in one step

7

here, because number 1, they could simply eliminate the

8

benefits, and having eliminated the benefits they could

9

then eliminate their division or fire all those employees

10

who had been getting the benefits, and so the different --

11

it seems to me that your argument is a very formalistic

12

argument.

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Justice Souter, I believe that we

14

need to make a proviso -- and I believe that the

15

Government may talk about this.

16

believe, for the opinion that even plan amendments can't

17

be made without -- when they're done for a specific

18

discriminatory purpose.

19

QUESTION:

There is some basis, I

I am not prepared to - -

Well, but why is it a discriminatory

20

purpose simply to say I am - - you know that they can be

21

eliminated, period, can't they?

22

They're costing me too much.

There's no

23

collective bargaining agreement that I would violate.

24

There's no multiemployer plan, so I have autonomy here,

25

and I'm simply going to eliminate them.

That they can do

1

as a general proposition.

2

MR. SCHWARTZ:

3

QUESTION:

As a general proposition, yes.

All right.

And what, then -- if they

4

can do that, why does it then become discriminatory when,

5

having eliminated those benefits they say, I probably

6

would be better off to have an outside company doing this

7

work, so I will eliminate the employees, too.

8

9
10
11
12

How does that suddenly turn the prior action
into a discriminatory one?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

We're dealing with a situation

here, what is generally called a fire and hire situation.
They wanted to keep these employees.

They're

13

highly trained and productive.

14

them without the benefits, and therefore they had to go

15

through this elaborate - -

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but they --

17

guess they didn't.

18

won't be any more benefits.

19

But they wanted to keep

on your theory I

All they had to do was to say there

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I think it's a great deal

20

more complicated than that.

21

necessary plan amendments and, making plan amendments,

22

they incur consequences with their own workforce.

23

QUESTION:

They have to make the

But if they wanted to go to the --

24

oh, you are quite right there's a countervailing sort of

25

political consideration within the marketplace because you

then end up with a bunch of employees who are mad, but if,

2

as a matter of law, they want to accept that burden,

3

can -- the employer could do that and couldn't have --

4

could have done it here,

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I take it,

they

is that right?

Certainly I do not think it is

6

correct that the employer here could have done it without

7

modification of their contract.

8

9

QUESTION:
yes.

All right, because you had a CBA,

Yes.

10

MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.

May I ask this question?

I

12

understood you to say earlier in your presentation that

13

the rights at stake here had already vested, which puzzles

14

me because you're relying on a statute that talks about

15

being - - losing - - being discharged in order to prevent a

16

right from becoming vested, or attainment and so forth.

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

18

QUESTION:

19

Justice Stevens --

Which is your view?

Are the rights

vested or not?

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We believe that the rights are

21

contractually vested for the duration of the collective

22

bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

23
24
25

This was a
Oh,

I see, being vested in an unusual

sense.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

And if you had a vested right, why

2

don't you just sue to recover that right?

3

the statute, it seems to me, to recover -- to get

4

compensation for the destruction of a vested right.

6

The statute is designed to prevent, discharged
in order to avoid vesting.

7

MR. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

9

You don't need

Yes.
And I'm not quite clear exactly what

your position is on that.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

The position is that they were

11

vested for a limited period under the terms of the CBA,

12

Justice Stevens.

13

QUESTION:

All right.

Give me an example of a

14

particular individual who had a vested right and is not

15

able to just sue for that right without relying on the

statute.

QUESTION:

He had the right to have it
Or - -

Well --

-- the right in the future if he

wants to go to the dentist it will be paid?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It's important to understand that

within the context of the CBA, of course, we're dealing

24

with section 301.

25

grievance and arbitration machinery, and exclusive

We're dealing with a lot of elaborate

remedies.

2

Teamsters local that was not able to share those burdens.

3

We're also dealing here with a bankrupt

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schwartz, the question

4

presented in your petition for certiorari is based

5

entirely, as I would read the question, on section 510 of

6

ERISA, and that certainly was the basis for the Ninth

7

Circuit's decision, and some of my colleagues I think are

8

expressing the view what has the collective bargaining

9

agreement and all that got to do with it if you're

10

claiming under section 510?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

We are claiming exclusively under

12

section 510.

13

agreement, Mr. Chief Justice, is important in terms of

14

understanding the context in which this arose.

15

We believe that the collective bargaining

Those are kind of weasel words.

16

The - - important in understanding the context in which it

17

arose.

18

would, what the collective bargaining agreement has to do

19

with it.

20

If it's based on 510, tell me specifically, if you

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I believe the collective

21

bargaining agreement has to do with evaluating the

22

respondent's arguments relating to targeting their claim

23

for a judicially crafted exception to section 510.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, as I read the respondent's

brief they no longer support the reasoning of the Ninth

1

Circuit in that respect, or at least they say you don't

2

have to read the Ninth Circuit opinion in that view.

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Our understanding is that they no

4

longer support the Ninth Circuit's rationale for the

5

decision in the case.
QUESTION:

6

You mentioned something about the

7

bankrupt Teamsters Union, and as I understand it both the

8

old employer, the Santa Fe group, and the new employer,

9

the ITS, both were units that had Teamsters representing

10

the workers.

Is that not so?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

These workers in large part were

12

given a last minute opportunity to apply for reemployment

13

with the substitute employer, respondent Internal

14

Services.

15

with greatly reduced benefits.

16

QUESTION:

17

The Teamsters Union signed them to a contract

Is it -- was it the same Local in

both cases?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it was.

And the union has not taken any

20

position throughout these proceedings, these 510

21

proceedings?

22

MR. SCHWARTZ:

23

QUESTION:

None whatsoever.

Strange, when you, whether for

24

background or whatever reason, talk about labor law

25

rights, and the union has not been heard from.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

1

I believe it has to do with the

2

internal Teamster struggles locally in Los Angeles and

3

nationally, Justice Ginsburg.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what health and welfare

5

benefits were actually reduced as a result of the

6

restructuring of the work at Hobart Yard?

7
8

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The health insurance coverage was

dramatically reduced.

things that had already occurred.

It occurred within a matter of a

space of less than 2 weeks, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

But we aren't talking about people

16

who had incurred an injury and wanted medical benefits.

17

We're talking about people who might in the future incur

18

injuries or illness and need medical benefits.

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We -- Justice O'Connor, we're

20

talking about people who enjoyed for a period of at least

21

1 year longer before the implementation of this

22

transaction an ongoing coverage of entire medical care.

23

QUESTION:

Well, they had health insurance, but

24

we're not talking about people who had gotten sick and

25

incurred medical bills already, and then they weren't

We're talking about future opportunity to do that.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

As far as we are aware the

-- the date of implementation.

we're dealing with a loss of vacation pay, a loss of sick

pay, and the welfare -QUESTION:

But not vacation pay that had

bargained Teamster contract to what is known as a white

focused contract - -

QUESTION:

We're trying to talk about section

from you, how to make it fit under section 510 of ERISA.

We're not trying to talk to you about the

MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We think --

Your claim, that is.
Justice O'Connor, we think it's

12

from the plain language and the underlying legislative

13

history and the purpose of Congress in enacting ERISA that

14

the second clause of section 510 covers this situation

precisely.

Wouldn't you say attainment, though,

future?

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, but it doesn't necessarily

21

imply vesting, and in this particular situation, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, we had a situation where people expected that if

23

their children had doctor appointments in April or May

24

they would be covered under the Teamsters plan.

25

needed to go in for a previously scheduled operation in

If they

1

June, that would have been covered prior to March 19, when

2

the people were suddenly informed that they were going to

3

have the opportunity with the new employer on April 1.

4

QUESTION:

But I suppose the employer's argument

5

is that if something had not been attained as of the date

6

this action was taken, it didn't violate that section,

7

section 510.

8

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I hesitate to speak for Mr.

Holzhauer, but it's our understanding with their -- they

10

have -- I believe they have essentially conceded and would

11

no longer take the position that the welfare, health and

12

welfare benefits such as are involved here are not covered

13

by the second clause of 510.

14

throughout their brief.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I think that's apparent

No, I understood their argument to

focus more on the phrase accompanying the word attainment.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I -- what we find is the more

18

interesting and perhaps troublesome issues deal more with

19

their argument relating to targeting, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

Clearly, attainment and may become entitled indicate some

21

element of maturity, certainly.

22

QUESTION:

I mean, supposing you've been working

23

at a place 11 months and you don't get medical benefits

24

until you've been there for a year.

25

would fit very nicely under the attainment clause.

It seems to me that

You're

1

fired at the end of 11 months because the employee doesn't

2

want you to get medical benefits.

3

this case, is it?

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

But that really isn't

No, it's not, because here -- it

5

might be the case that if you were working at that

6

hypothetical employer under a contract that had another

7

year and -- another 13 months to go, instead of being an

8

at-will employee.

9
10

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one hypothetical

question?

11

Supposing there's no union agreement or anything

12

involved, and the employer finds out that a segment of his

13

workforce performing one specific task, they -- they're

14

entitled to welfare -- health and -- health benefits, and

15

they find out that if they subcontracted all that work out

16

to others they would save the cost of those benefits, and

17

they decide that's the reason they want to make that

18

change, and they do it.

19

Have they violated the statute?

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I believe that's -- they have,

21

Mr. Justice Stevens, and I believe that that's pretty much

22

what occurred here.

in the entire railyard that was dealing with -- that was

correctly?

8

MS. PILLARD:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Our position is that section 510 is not limited

9
10

to pension rights or rights capable of vesting, but also

11

covers rights to welfare benefits.

12

holding to the contrary cannot be squared with the

13

language of the statute.

The court of appeals'

Section 510 uses the general term, employee

14
15

benefit plans, which the statute defines to include both

16

pension plans and welfare benefit plans.

17

QUESTION:

Well, the respondent seems to pretty

18

well agree with this much of your argument.

What do you

19

do with my hypothetical case, just a clean-cut example of

20

trying to cut costs among others by welfare -- you know,

21

by contracting out to save the money there?
That's clearly an economic motive, and there

22

23

were no vested benefits in the sense that there were no

24

unpaid medical bills based on injuries that had already

occurred.

Pure economic -- everyone is healthy at the time

that the decision is made, but it's just a little cheaper

to do it this way.
MS. PILLARD:

12

In our view that would not be

covered.

What is covered, however, and what we believe is

14

a core case is a case of a person who the employer knows

15

has become ill, and who is fired before that person has

16

seen the doctor, and therefore before the right to medical

17

care has actually accrued.

18

QUESTION:

This happens all the time?

19

MS. PILLARD:

This is a very common scenario,

20

where an employer has offered health care coverage with

21

particular coverage levels, and when an employee becomes

22

ill, although the employer would be free generally to

23

amend the plan to eliminate coverage for an illness that

24

seems too expensive or burdensome, instead, the employee

keeps the plan in place with respect to other employees

The

cover the situation in which the employee has a concrete

arriving at, or attaining a ripe old age is the way

Black's defined it, citing some old cases, reaching or

First of all, I think

2

the tooth extraction case might come under the exercising

3

part of section 5 0, but in the Third Circuit case, the

4

Gavelette case, the Court determined that the employer

5

decided that a large group of employees at one plant were

6

about to become vested at one point, or were subject to

7

vesting and were about to reach the vesting point, which

8

is possible, considering that vesting is over time.

9

might be a plant that was just opened 5 years ago.

It

Under those circumstances I think an argument, a

10
11

strong argument can be made that section 5 0 has been

violated even though the decision is not on an individual

basis.

that's another future-oriented kind of reference in that

But isn't it equally clear -- let me

MR. HOLZHAUER:
QUESTION:

Sure.

That if you took my hypothetical and

4

said, instead of health benefits, we're concerned that 90

5

percent of these people are about to reach 20 years of

6

service and therefore have vested benefits, and you took

out the whole division and substituted with a contract,

that would clearly violate it, would it not?

2

that would be a section 510 violation.

3

Now, Justice Kennedy, in your question, the

4

person that had the tooth extracted clearly would violate

5

section 510, the exercising clause, to fire him because he

6

filed a claim.

7

I think a strong argument can be made that if

8

the employer sees him coming down the hall with his claim

9

form and a stack of medical bills with it, it might

10

violate 510 then as well, and it might violate 510, the

11

exercising clause, if the employee -- employer knew that

12

that employee has a particular illness or particular

13

condition that is going to require, or has already

14

required large expenditures or benefits.

15

But that's not what we have here.

What we have

16

here is something very close, as counsel for petitioners

17

acknowledge, to Justice Stevens' hypothetical, an employer

18

who decides that benefit costs are too high.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Well, of course, there's nothing

in section 510 that talks about employers being required

to amend or terminate plans, but in many situations that's

certainly no requirement in section 510, no language that

No, and that as far as the pension

didn't take a cross -appeal.

14

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Well, the Ninth Circuit held --

again, the Ninth Circuit's treatment of both of these

issues was rather cursory, so it's really hard to

17

understand exactly what their reasoning was, but quoting

18

Ingersoll-Rand, the Ninth Circuit held that 510 protects

19

plan participants from termination motivated by an

20

employer's desire to prevent a pension from vesting.

Santa Fe saw no need to cross-petition on that

issue, because it's quite confident that when it goes back

If they're

Now, section 510 was adopted as a corollary to

5

ERISA's vesting requirement, which was essential to the

6

statutory scheme put in place by Congress, and for the

7

first time Congress required that pension benefits become

8

nonforfeitable after a set period of time.

9

Congress recognized that employers might

10

circumvent that vesting requirement by discharging

11

employees who were about to become vested, and they

12

installed section 510 to deal with that problem.

13

It makes perfect sense in that context to say it

protects you, the attainment clause of section 510

protects you until you become eligible for the benefits,

circumventing the exercise clause.

19

QUESTION:

I was talking about

The exercise clause.

If we allow

20

that the exercise clause can be circumvented, how do we

21

draw -- that circumvention of the exercise clause would

22

state a violation, how do we draw the line?

23

that swallow the attainment issue?

24

MR. HOLZHAUER:

25

Well,

Why doesn't

I think the exercising

clause was intended to deal with a kind of individual -48

not global plant closing or plan design situation, but an

2

individual situation where you were focusing and targeting

3

a particular individual and saying, that person's going to

4

be too expensive.

5

because their benefits are too high.

I am going to terminate that person

6

Clearly, it does violate the exercising clause

7

by any reading to do that after the employee has started

8

filing those benefits -- oh, he's exercised his right to

9

benefits too much, I'm going to fire him as a consequence

10

of doing that.
The question is whether, in the very same

11
12

circumstances, where you're looking at an individual

13

employee who's about to file a lot of claims because he

14

has bad wisdom teeth, or he has other problems, whether

15

that would violate the exercising clause in section 510,

16

and I think an argument could be made that it would.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

So do it on the specific employee

basis.
MR. HOLZHAUER:

The specific employee, rather

20

than a global, cost-based organizational change.

21

been going on in this case was a fundamental change in the

22

way Santa Fe operated its business.

23

going to be using its own employees to do that work.

24

was subcontracting that work out to other employees.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

QUESTION:

MR. HOLZHAUER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

I'm entitled to it.
Right.

And by the way, if I worked 2 more

6

years and have a promotion, it doubles in amount, so they

7

fire me so I don't get the doubling in amount.

8

part of the -- is that the fail to exercise clause?

9

MR. HOLZHAUER:
QUESTION:

10

Now, which

Well --

Is that failure to attain a benefit,

11

or do you think they could do it?

12

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I think that there certainly --

13

there are circumstances -- generally speaking, pension

14

benefits are required under the statute to accrue rateably

15

over time, not to have these kinds of cliffs in which

16

you're entitled under the plan to additional money.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HOLZHAUER:

You see what I'm driving at.
Yes.

There are circumstances --

19

for example, I think the Heath case was one of those, in

20

the Seventh Circuit, where an employee was entitled to

21

early retirement, additional benefits if they reached a

22

certain age, and I think that he would become eligible for

23

those benefits if they stayed on the workforce.

25

QUESTION:

What you're saying the Court did say

there.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

QUESTION:

3

MR. HOLZHAUER:

4

QUESTION:

That's right.

It's an attainment matter.
That's an attainment matter.

And therefore the normal thing in

5

getting an amount of money when a certain event happens

6

under a plan that has vested, at least in the pension

7

area, seems to be to call it an attainment.

8

MR. HOLZHAUER:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

Well, if you follow the same

10

reasoning here, you're going to say getting that amount of

11

money under a plan that has vested when the toothache

12

occurs - -

3

MR. HOLZHAUER:

No, no.

We're not talking about

4

getting that amount of money.

5

becoming eligible for a new benefit.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HOLZHAUER:

8

All right.

We're talking about

All right.

An employee who was not entitled

to an early retirement benefit.

9

QUESTION:

All right.

Did you have something

20

you wanted to say about purpose, because the only reason I

21

ask that is that seems to have come up, and I'm not

22

certain we should reach it here, but I know it's been

23

argued.

24

MR. HOLZHAUER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

And maybe you'd be better to do it

with facts, or with amici, or whatever, but if you did

2

make a point about it - -

3

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Well, I think the purpose of the

4

overall statute was to deal with the vesting circumstance,

5

and then to prevent people from circumventing someone from

6

vesting, and I think when there are analogous

7

circumstances like someone about to become eligible for

8

early retirement benefits, under those circumstances that

9

would be a similar eligibility threshold, and crossing

10

that eligibility threshold would be involved, but nothing

11

like that is going on here.

12

change.

13

QUESTION:

This is a global prospects

So are you saying that the D.C.

14

Circuit approach in the Andes case, they didn't even need

15

to get to anything like, what does the word discharge

16

mean?

17

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Yes, I agree with that.

I found

18

that decision puzzling, because the Court said on the one

19

hand these employees weren't discharged and we didn't --

20

Congress didn't use the words layoff and termination in

21

that case, but then it said that well, there might be some

22

circumstances where a particular attribute of that

23

workforce might call it into play.

24
25

I assume they were referring to the Gavelette
case, or that kind of hypothetical in their situation,

2

where it would apply.
Well, if it's not a termination to subcontract

3

out work under these circumstances, how would it be a

4

termination or a discharge under those second set of

5

circumstances?

6

I think the D.C. Circuit was struggling with

7

what several other courts have struggled with as how to

8

fit section 510, how to square section 510 with these

9

kinds of fundamental business changes, cost-based changes

10

that employers ordinarily do, and this is very much like

11

the kind of change that Peter Drucker talked about in his

12

Wall Street Journal article some years, Sell the Mailroom.

13

These kinds of changes are not the kind of thing

14
15
16

that ERISA was intended to encompass.
QUESTION:

Would your attainment test have

resolved the Andes case in favor of the employer?
MR. HOLZHAUER:

Yes, it would have.

Yes, it

would have.
QUESTION:

I wonder, because in paragraph 30

20

they specifically argue, or allege that benefits -- they

21

suffered a reduction of benefits from their pension plan

and health and welfare plans.

the complaint.

There's that allegation in

true, that's a vested right that was -MR. HOLZHAUER:

2

Well, they claim that they

3

suffered welfare -- they claim that they were -- that

4

Santa Fe took this action in order to reduce a wide

5

spectrum of benefits, salary, vacation, sick leave

6

benefits, things that are not ERISA-included.

cases of individual vestings.

It covered at least some hypothetical

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Well, they -- I don't think it

does.

I don't think the pleading covers individuals.

talks about terminating welfare and pension -QUESTION:

12

It

Suffered a reduction of contributions

13

to and benefits from pension plans and health and welfare

plans.
MR. HOLZHAUER:

15

Right.

What they were talking

16

about is the fact that under the new ITS Teamsters

17

contract there was a reduction in contributions.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but they say benefits.

19

MR. HOLZHAUER:

And a commensurate reduction in

20

benefits, but it was not something that interfered with

21

their attainment of eligibility for a particular category

22

of benefits.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that is the difference between

24

you and the Government on how you read that paragraph, I

25

guess.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

1

Well, it could be, but I think

2

if you look at the entire complaint, you look at what

3

petitioners have said in their briefs and in this

4

argument, it's clear that basically what this case comes

down to is the hypothetical you raised early on in the

argument.
