ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BRINKMANN:

9

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

11

This case involves respondent's request for a

12

waiver of deportation under section 241(a)(1)(H) of the

13

Immigration and Nationality Act.

14

decision to the discretion of the Attorney General.

The act commits that

Exercising her discretion in this case, the

15
16

Attorney General properly considered numerous frauds

17

committed by respondent, including his fraudulent

18

application for naturalization, fraudulent marriages,

19

fraudulent divorce, and his participation in the

20

fraudulent obtaining of documents for his wife's

21

fraudulent entry into the country.

22

The Attorney General did not, again as a matter

23

of discretion, consider the fraud respondent committed at

24

entry.

25

QUESTION:

I take it under the statute, the

1

Attorney General would have been perfectly free to

2

consider that fraud.

3
4
5

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

in fact the Seventh Circuit has expressly recognized that.
In Rodriguez-Barajas, Judge Easterbrook

6

explained that the Attorney General's under no compulsion

7

to disregard that initial fraud, and that any limitation

8

on that has arisen out of the Attorney General's exercise

9

of her discretion.

10

QUESTION:

Well, you think, then, that the

11

statute places no outer limits whatever on the discretion

12

of the Attorney General?

13

If the Attorney General took the position that

14

the fact of a fraudulent entry by the alien is a factor

15

weighing against waiver, then nobody would be entitled to

16

a waiver any time.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Well, Your Honor --

I mean, that condition exists in

every one of these cases.
MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

21

aliens that are in the pool of eligible aliens for this

22

type of waiver share several common characteristics.

23

all have three factors weighing in their favor.

24

to be the relative -- the parent, son or daughter or

25

spouse of a citizen or a permanent resident alien.

They

They

1

also must have presented themselves for entry.

2

to have a validly, facially valid document, and they have

3

to be otherwise admissible.

4

They also share the fact --

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

7
8

9

They have

But for the fraud.
Yes.

They also share the fact

that they all committed entry fraud.
Now, looking at that pool of applicants, the
Attorney General has to decide who amongst that she should

10

exercise her discretion to give a waiver to, and our

11

submission is that it's certainly proper for the Attorney

12

General to favor a person who has been law-abiding since

13

their initial entry over someone who's perpetrated a

14

series of frauds.

15

We would also submit, Your Honor, although it

16

has not come up in the typical kinds of cases that have

17

come before the board, if, for example, the entry fraud

18

was intertwined with violence, for example, we certainly

19

think the Attorney General in her discretion could take

20

that into account.

21

22

QUESTION:

Well, could take into account the

circumstances of the particular fraudulent entry.

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, Your Honor.

But not the mere fact that there had

been a fraudulent entry, I take it?

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

I'd look to the -- for example,

2

the Court in the Rios-Pineda case, when the Court was

3

looking at the Attorney General's authority whether or not

4

to grant suspension of deportation there, I think

5

characterizes looking to the nature and severity of the

6

factor, so I would think that that would clearly be

7

appropriate for the Attorney General to take into account.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, just because Congress has given

the Attorney General the power to waive fraud, certainly

10

you don't concede that the Attorney General couldn't say,

11

I have the power but I decline to waive any kind of fraud.

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In

13

fact, particularly in the immigration context there may be

14

other matters of foreign affairs or international

15

relations that at a particular point in time the Attorney

16

General would choose not to exercise her discretion in

17

favor of waivers under this provision.

18

QUESTION:

The statute does circumscribe

19

discretion in one respect, does it not, or perhaps not,

20

because the sentence is difficult.

21

sub (H), a waiver of deportation for fraud granted under

22

this subparagraph shall also operate to waive deportation

23

based on the grounds of inadmissibility at entry.

24
25

The last sentence of

What's the function of that sentence, other than
to circumscribe or control the discretion of the AG?

Maybe you'll tell me --

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

4
5

If I under --

-- it's an interpretation of the

discretion once exercised.
MS. BRINKMANN:

I think, if I understand your

6

question correctly, Your Honor, it's clarifying some

7

confusion that had existed under their previous provision,

8

and it makes clear that if the Attorney General grants a

9

waiver of deportation under this provision, that waiver of

10

deportation waived the grounds of inadmissibility for the

11

fraud and also for inadmissibility grounds that directly

12

result from that, that being a fraudulent visa or

13

fraudulent labor certification.

14

QUESTION:

Would that be relevant in a later

15

application for citizenship, or something like that?

16

that why it's important?

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Is

Well, in fact --

Because it seems to me to just

restate that a waiver's a waiver.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I think I can

21

give an example to explain it.

23

certificates.

1

information at a consulate beforehand, and then when they

2

arrive at the port of entry, they continue to stand by

3

what's in that visa, but perhaps they've been unmarried --

4

they've been divorced or married in the meantime, so they

5

would be committing a fraud at entry, but that would not

6

necessarily relate to any fraudulent document.

7

If they had an independently based fraudulent

8

document, that could be a ground of inadmissibility, and

9

it would not be waived because it would not directly

10

result from their fraud, and I think what the statute was

11

trying to get at was that any of the grounds of

12

inadmissibility at the time of entry that directly result

13

from the entry fraud are also waived.

14

QUESTION:

May I --

15

QUESTION:

But then that is a narrowing of the

16

Attorney General's discretion.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

No.

We would simply say that

18

describes what the effect of the grant of the waiver is.

19

The Attorney General grants a waiver, and it specifies

20

that it waives deportation based on those grounds.

21

what the effect of a 241(a)(1)(H) waiver --

22

QUESTION:

That's

Well, it circumscribes the Attorney

23

General to some extent in that it does control the extent

24

of the waiver.

Honor.

2

On the other hand, we would submit that as in my

3

previous discussion of how the Attorney General could take

4

into account the nature and severity of the initial fraud,

5

the Attorney General certainly also as matter of

6

discretion could take into account the nature and severity

7

of the other grounds of inadmissibility on the fraudulent

8

labor certificate or visa, the means by which that was

9

procured.

QUESTION:

I have to confess I'm still a little

11

puzzled about your answer to Justice O'Connor.

12

understood you to say that the Attorney General could not

13

take into account the mere existence of some fraud, could
take into account the nature of the fraud, but are you

14

15

saying that if -- say there's the mildest kind of form in

16

the -- fraud in the world, that the mere fact there was a

17

fraud could not be taken into consideration?

MS. BRINKMANN:

Attorney General has discretion.

25

No, I'm sorry, I misspoke if

I --

Otherwise, it seems to me a person

could commit a fraud and then claim a right to remain.

Honor, one of the ironies of the Ninth Circuit's ruling in

2

this case is, it really gives the type of open-ended

3

immunity to aliens who enter by fraud.

4

later frauds be considered as a part of or an extension of

5

the entry fraud, those aliens are put at an advantage over

6

an alien who enters lawfully and then commits later fraud

7

which is not forgiven.
QUESTION:

8

10

But are you saying that the Attorney

General would be within her discretion to say, I will
never exercise my discretion to waive entry fraud?

We believe that if that were

based on a reasonable exercise of her discretion --

would be.

think of an example in which that might be the case, and I

21

come back to the example of perhaps there are other

immigration interests and other quotas that are so -- so

23

important, and as a matter of policy --

which the statute might be applied.

2

I'm not asking a question about subclasses.

I'm

talking about the entire class of possible waivers, and

construed that broadly, would it be within her discretion

to say, I will never exercise my discretion in favor of

As I mentioned earlier,

if a case arose in which

something which the board may very well --

But do you say you're free to depart

from that rule and that practice at any time you want?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor,

I think to the

extent that --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

For no reason at all?
I think to the extent that there

12

is judicial review for abuse of discretion the board would

13

be well advised to provide a reason.

14

I have to hasten -- have to -- have to be quick

15

to add at this point, Your Honor, at this point it's

16

somewhat of a limited query, because the new statute that

17

was passed a week and a half ago eliminates judicial

18

review of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion

19

under this provision.

That doesn't mean you get it, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

At that point

Well, you may not get it, but you

won't be denied it simply because you got in fraudulently.
MS. BRINKMANN:

It will -- when the Attorney

7

General, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the immigration

8

judge exercise their discretion, the practice at this

9

point is not to take into account the initial entry fraud.

No matter how severe --

QUESTION:

I --

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

Why is that?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

The fact of the matter is, Your

16

Honors, when I've looked through all the cases, the

17

typical case that has come forward involves very similar

18

types of fraud, mainly people misrepresenting the fact

19

they've been married, or been divorced, family relations

20

There have not been cases which involve incidences of

21

violence, for example, and --

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

of cases -- why does the BIA disregard that fraud?
MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that it's taken as a matter of treating like cases

alike, and that that's -QUESTION:

2

Well, you could treat like cases

3

alike and say we'll -- we will not disregard it in any of

4

them.
MS. BRINKMANN:

5

Right, and that's what the

6

alien's coming forward to, as asking for forgiveness for,

7

as the board has characterized it.
QUESTION:

10

Ms. Brinkmann, there was one time

when this kind of waiver for initial entry fraud was
mandatory.

14

something in between.

15

in the discretion of the Attorney General, be waived, but

16

if you can respond to the question that's been raised by

17

several of the justices, why in the first place did

18

Congress provide for initially a mandatory waiver and now

19

a discretionary waiver for one who has gained entry by

20

fraud?

21

Yes.

And then it was urged that Congress

Your Honor, initially, this was

enacted as section 7 of the Immigration Act in 1957, and

it was responding to entry by -- immigrants were fleeing

repression in totalitarian regimes, and had made

misrepresentations in order to avoid repression, and

1

that's when the provision was first enacted, added to the

2

statute.

3

Then it was somewhat modified in 1961.

In

4

between 1961 and 1981, that's when all the trouble and

5

confusion started occurring, and that's what prompted

6

Congress in 1981, or the proposals pending in Congress, to

7

eliminate it altogether because it had caused such

8

confusion.

9

For example, persons who entered by an innocent

10

misrepresentation some courts had held were not eligible

11

for the waiver, whereas aliens who had entered through

12

fraudulent misrepresentations were.

13

the 1981 statute -- amendment corrected.

14

course, made it discretionary.

15

That's something that
It also, of

It also made it clear, for example, that it was

not going to waive deportation for aliens who entered

QUESTION:

Now --- policy by discretion of the

19

executive is that anyone who commits fraud successfully

20

upon entry is okay.

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

I wouldn't say it's okay, Your

22

Honor, but it's enough like all of the other cases that

23

have come before the board that it's a wash, and that the

Well, it dates back to

There's a similar provision for waiver

of exclusion grounds, and that's when the Commissioner of

11

INS first articulated this.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought we were going to get

13

serious about -- about enforcing our borders, and I was

14

really quite surprised to find that that's the policy.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I have to say

I think that in light of the statute that was recently

passed, that Your Honor -- certainly it's a situation I

think now where Congress has eliminated this provision

from judicial review, and the --

immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, or permanent

resident aliens, and the main thrust behind this provision

When that first statement was made about the

It was mandatory.

The exclusion waiver

has always been discretionary, so once the deportation

to the interpretation that had been given to the exclusion

MS. BRINKMANN:

We don't believe so, Your Honor.

I think looking at the text of this statute following the

Ms. Brinkmann, may I go to the other

end of the spectrum and make sure I understand you on one

point, and that is, I understand you to have said that the

fraud regardless of what it's circumstances may be.
In other words, there's no minor fraud versus

All frauds are equal if they are initial

It's difficult to answer that

Okay.
I think that's true, and I think

the Attorney General would be free to change her policy

more severely, in fact --

And there's also a question of what

If I understand the way this policy

Once we reach that

threshold that the fraud is taken off the table and not to

12

It wouldn't even have to be there at all if the

Attorney General had absolute unfettered discretion.

we take into account first the words that say "may,

Are you saying that Congress --

Your Honor, the change to add the word

discretion in 1981 did not change the intent and purpose

of the waiver.

12

was a separate exclusion ground with a parallel waiver,

grant a waiver in its discretion for similar types of

frauds.

that renders him excludable in deciding whether or not to

grant the waiver, and then the immigration judge, or the

purpose of otherwise admissible, to account for the

concern that Your Honors have expressed previously that

there may be certain factors in the commission of the

fraud that are so heinous that we as human beings would

If that's so, I can understand --

initial kinds of fraud that led Congress to grant the

discretion in the first place, which is what you're

arguing now, I think, but assuming for the sake of

language which talks about a waiver being related -- being

a direct result of that fraud -- it says, that fraud, and

11

that fraud means the fraud that enabled the alien to

12

procure a visa, which this alien procured in 1978.

13

you get from that to saying that the Attorney General

cannot take into account her view of a different fraud,

parcel of the same thing, I don't see how you escape the

language.

20

MR. HOM:

If we look at the initial language of

21

241(a)(1)(H) on page 5a, the provisions of this paragraph

22

relating to the deportation of aliens within the United

23

States on the ground that they were excludable at the time

24

of entry as aliens, described in section 1182(6) (C) .

25

So if you look at the classification described

1

in 212(a)(6)(C), which is on the petitioner's brief at

2

page 2a, the language there states -- misrepresentation is

3

the caption -- any alien who by fraud or wilfully

4

misrepresenting a material fact seeks to procure or has

5

sought to procure or has procured a visa or other

6

documentation or entry into the United States, those words

7

there clearly show that acts could have occurred not just

8

at the time of entry, but in the past in seeking the visa,

9

or actually having obtained the visa, so it's very clear

10

that the statute that grants the waiver is not limited to

11

acts occurring at the time of entry, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

It's not the statute that grants the

13

waiver, it's the statute that makes the immigrant eligible

14

to request a waiver.

15

MR. HOM:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

Right.

18

MR. HOM:

19
20
21

22

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the historical development of the

act -- of the waiver -QUESTION:

It's still referring to the fraud

that led him to have procured the visa.
MR. HOM:

Well, that's not inconsistent with

23

212(a)(6)(C).

24

in terms of present tense and past tense, so that those

25

acts which are related to the visa procurement, yes.

The statutory language talks and uses words

1

If there are other acts not related to the visa

2

procurement, then he would be otherwise inadmissible and

3

the waiver could be denied, so I don't see that as

4

inconsistent with our position, and I think that that

5

should lay to rest a lot of concerns that the waiver is

6

carte blanche to let immigrants come in, commit heinous

7

crimes, and get away with murder.

QUESTION:

Mr. Horn, if we looked at it from this

point of view, let's say that there's something ambiguous

10

about this, and a judge is trying to determine what the

11

statute means and says, well -- let's assume that one

12

person who got into the United States without making any

13

false representations, no fraud, and once in the United

14

States engaged in the very same acts as occurred here,

15

such a person would be deportable, but if in addition to

16

engaging in those acts there had been a fraud at entry,

that person is eligible for a waiver.

MR. HOM:

Yes, what that refers to, Your Honor,

is that if the immigrant had applied -- you have two

situations.

based upon a labor certification, for example, and he --

if he properly processed that labor certification, but

submitted fraudulent documents, then that is the kind of

MR. HOM:

3

the reason that it's in (6)(C), as I read it, is in the

4

preceding codification the words fraud and representation

were at the top of (f), and they were broken out by

Congress and moved to (6)(C), and so the antecedent for

7

that is now (6)(C), is that right?

9

MR. HOM:

Thank you, Your Honor, but there's

also one other aspect of that.

If an immigrant had bought

the visa outside of the consular context instead of in the

another aspect to it.

divorced his wife and had not made that representation or

showed that divorce document to the consular officer at

fraud that's encompassed and would not be the kind of

There are cases of frauds and bad acts that may

be punished, and properly so.

There are criminal

4

sanctions that would be available, and once criminal

convictions are obtained, then the alien becomes

inadmissible under various sections of 212(a), so that the

7

integrity of the immigration system is preserved.

8

are not a whole lot of waivers granted under this

9

particular section.

10

QUESTION:

There

Mr. Horn, there's one problem that I

11

have with your notion that the consistent repetition of

12

the same misrepresentation is a wash.

13

the same thing every time, then it all must be forgiven.

14

As long as you say

The statements about Mary Wong who was a dead

soul, that were repeatedly made on documents signed by

these people, were they not indictable crimes as false

MR. HOM:

Possibly, but that's the very waiver

that is -- the reason why the waiver is there.
QUESTION:

So what you're saying is that you

21

could have these people engage in repeated criminal

22

conduct and nonetheless the Attorney General must ignore

that in determining their eligibility for a waiver.

So if there is any ambiguity you say

have committed in the United States repeated criminal acts

The key phrase was

MR. HOM:

Right, but he would not be eligible

11

for the waiver because he would have been convicted of

crimes involving moral turpitude, which are other grounds

enumerated in subparagraph (ii) which are not listed

there, but that's what the reference --

QUESTION:

So what you say is, although this

it's not indicted, it must be treated as if it didn't

happen.

MR. HOM:

Not necessarily indicted.

are -- if there's an admission that he had committed the

21

elements of the act that involves --

that's the purpose of the waiver.
QUESTION:

4

He did sign those documents, and

And was it not true that at the time

he signed those documents Mary Wong was a very dead soul?

5

MR. HOM:

That's correct.

His wife, Mr. Yang's

6

wife had assumed the identity of Mary Wong.

He did not

7

represent that he was married to a deceased person.

8

was saying that his wife, his current wife, who used a new

9

name, and that's why I've been trying to explain that this

10

is a matter of an assumed identity as opposed to a --

11

another type of elaborate fraud, as Your Honors have

12

eluded to.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me extraordinary

that Congress would mandate that the Attorney General not

MR. HOM:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes, he did, but -And he could not have been the

husband of Mary Wong, as Mary Wong was dead.

5

MR. HOM:

That's correct, Your Honor.

If there

6

was evidence to lead to a criminal conviction, one should

7

have been brought, and then he should have been convicted

8

and, if convicted, deported on that basis, and not

9

deported based upon some exception or some misconstruction

10

of a statute that has very salutary purposes behind it

11

just because of potential prosecution.
If there was a prosecution, then he renders

12

13

himself not to be otherwise admissible within the language

14

of subparagraph (ii) and the person could be deported, so

15

it's not a matter of denying the waiver.

16

QUESTION:

But something he does 4 years

17

afterwards, that wouldn't bear on his admissibility, would

18

it?

19

MR. HOM:

The waiver focuses on two points.

20

Number 1, at the time of entry, is he within this

21

classification of having committed this fraud, so he

22

commits this one particular fraud, and he's warranted with

23

it and it becomes an individual part of his new

24

identity -- there's just no way he could shake that.

25

2

he applies for -- when he submits his income tax returns

3

he says he's married, and I'm sure he put down he was

4

married to Mary Wong.

5

When

All these are incidental aspects of his having

6

assumed this new identity in coming to America, and not

7

some separate independent fraud that has no relationship.

8

If he committed other frauds, of tax fraud, for example,

9

then he would be deportable on those independently, and so

10

we're not talking about a denial of a waiver in those

11

cases, but the fact that he's deportable on some other

12

ground.

13

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying, as you've said

14

before during your argument, that he can repeat the same

He could still be prosecuted

Would you comment on -- go back to

its most recent amendment said that the provisions of 241

and so forth and so on shall not apply to an alien

8

the Attorney General may, in her discretion, waive.
How do you get around the fact that one was a

9
10

Now it says with respect to those,

mandatory waiver and the other is a discretionary waiver?
MR. HOM:

11

At the time there was a mandatory

12

waiver of deportation.

13

waiver for exclusion, and the Immigration Service's

14

interpretation or application of the discretionary waiver

15

was also to disregard the fraud that renders him

16

inadmissible in deciding discretion, so that's the stage

17

that was set when Congress in 1981 passed the new

18

legislation to add on the word discretion for the

19

deportation waiver.

20

QUESTION:

21

22

There is also a discretionary

It conforms -And to take out the words,

"shall not

MR. HOM:

QUESTION:

So the change meant absolutely

nothing, in your view.

5

MR. HOM:

Relative to the initial fraud,

6

correct.

It would permit the Attorney General to look at

7

other factors, and we see from the discussion this morning

8

that there are other factors that should render an alien

9

inadmissible -- excuse me, that should result in the

10

waiver being denied, even though it does not render the

11

alien deportable and inadmissible.

12

which don't amount to a deportable act, but which

13

nevertheless I think we are agreed are reprehensible acts

14

and should be punished with the waiver being denied.

So there are acts

And there are some acts that are so

MR. HOM:

Yes.
--we see that persons who assisted in

7

Nazi persecution or engaged in genocide were not permitted

to apply for the waiver, and that was before it was made

discretionary, so there were people who covered up their

10

past involvement and came to the United States after World

They had the

16

relating to genocide and said those people, they do such

17

terrible things, they don't even get a chance to talk

18

about a waiver.

19

their loved ones be forgiven so that they may stay in this

MR. HOM:

Am I wrong about

Well, in the determination of

a factor.

That's right, Your Honor.

I

10

just wanted to respond to Justice Ginsburg's concern about

11

the possible criminal prosecution.

12

well, depending on the actual facts that haven't been

13

fully investigated, that they would have to be for a

14

criminal prosecution.

15

It's clear that --

There are at least three provisions in title 18

16

that could give rise to criminal prosecution.

17

false statements to a U.S. agency, also 1015 having to do

18

with fraud concerning naturalization, and then 1028 has to

do with fraud related to identification documents, and

that can be taken into account by the Attorney General.

9

It's not that the Attorney General has to prosecute and

10

imprison people rather than deporting them.

they can be taken into account, for example, in sentencing
