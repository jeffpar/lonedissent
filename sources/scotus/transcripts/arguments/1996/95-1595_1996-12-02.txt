ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the constitutionality of

12

section 2 -- of the amended version of section 207 of the

13

Indian Land Consolidation Act.

14

this statute was before this Court almost 10 years ago in

15

Hodel v. Irving, and the Court found it unconstitutional.

16

Our submission is that the amended statute remedies the

17

flaws that this Court found in the original version of the

18

statute, and the amended statute is therefore

19

constitutional.

20

The unamended version of

Now, the purpose -- the statute arose as a

21

response to what this Court has characterized in Hodel as

22

the extraordinary problem of extreme fractionation of

23

Indian trust lands.

24

people combine to own undivided interests in single

25

parcels of land makes productive use of the land very

Such extreme fractionation when many

difficult.

If a given parcel has a large number,

2

sometimes in the hundreds of different owners, it's very

3

hard for anyone to take initiative to see to it that the

4

parcel is put to a productive economic use.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Feldman, in this case, under the

6

facts of this case, did the disposition of the land in

7

question further fractionalize it or did one person take

8

each interest as a whole?

I mean, one daughter took some,

and a son took all of another, the interest in another
10

tract, and so on?

11

it, in this case?

It was not further fractionalized, was

MR. FELDMAN:

12

That's correct.

I mean,

13

actually -- in respect to one parcel of land was further

14

fractionated, but that was not a parcel that was subject

15

to a --

Does that make a difference, do you

No, I don't think it does.

fractionation is a serious problem, and that --

taking in that case.
MR. FELDMAN:

2

Right.

It was a taking because --

3

because such small -- because -- excuse me.

4

again.

Let me start

The Court held in Hodel that there was a taking

5
6

because it completely and totally eliminated all rights of

7

descent and devise for the land and, as the Court said

8

twice in its opinion, even when permitting descent or

9

devise would result in a consolidation of the land.
In this case none of the -- none of the interest

10
11

that they had passed effectively through the will would

12

have resulted in such a consolidation of the land and,

13

indeed, in Hodel v. Irving when the Court -- in one of the

14

places where the Court made that comment it put a Cf cite

15

specifically to the amended version of the statute.

16

Now, the amended version of the statute in our

17

view remedies the flaws in the original statue in two

18

ways.

19

impact of the statute, the amended -- the original statute

20

required that land be escheated if in the 1 year prior to

21

the decedent's death it had not earned more than $100, and

22

if the interest involved was less than 2 percent.

23

amended version of the --

1

the land is incapable of earning $100 in any one of the

2

5 years from the date of decedent's death, and where the

3

factional interest has earned its owner less than $100 in

4

any one of the 5 years before the decedent's death there's

5

a rebuttable presumption --

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

Yes.

-- that applies.
If I may, if I can take the first

passage that you quoted, it's our position that that is

10

ambiguous, and that the -- it is true that the any one --

11

incapable of earning $100 in any one of the 5 years could

12

mean in any of the 5 years or in any one --

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, that would be the normal

reading of it, I suppose.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Well --

I had a hard time understanding your

17

reading of it, which would read in the word each of the

18

5 years.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

No -- well, I think any in some

20

circumstances can mean each, especially when it's

21

conjoined with the negative, but let me just abstract from

22

that for a minute.

23

In the first place, that issue isn't presented

24

by this case because no one has claimed that our reading

25

of the statute in this case was wrong, but more

1

importantly, the kinds of lands that we're generally

2

dealing with here are lands that are useful primarily for

3

grazing or for mineral leasing, and as a general matter it

4

doesn't really make -- it will be a very small number of

5

cases where which year you're looking at is going to be an

6

important factor.

7

for grazing, it will be leased at about the same amount of

8

money every year.
QUESTION:

9

If it can be leased for a 5-year period

What about timber?

MR. FELDMAN:

10

Well, and if it can be leased for

11

timber harvest it might be more than a 5-year period that

12

a lease would permit, but still -QUESTION:

13

Well that's -- I asked -- you said

14

it's mostly grazing and mineral.

15

that, and not timber, because one of my concerns along the

16

lines of Justice O'Connor's questioning under this statute

17

is that timber harvesting typically is -- oh, some parts

18

of California at least once every 15 years.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Right.

Does the record support

As our reading of the --

But it could be very valuable in that

one year.
MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

In our reading of

23

the statute, because the other key part of the change is

24

not only that it changed to a 5-year period, but the

25

question is whether it's capable, not whether in fact in

any given year it earns an amount QUESTION:

2

What point does this go to?

Does it

3

go to the point that if the Government only takes a little

4

bit of value it's not a taking?

5

MR. FELDMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

It --

Do we have any law that says that a

de minimis taking is not a taking?
MR. FELDMAN:

8

9

No.

No, but it -- I think it does go

to the fact that Congress more carefully tailored what it

10

did in this statute to just those interests that were

11

causing the serious problem.
When someone owns the smallest interest that was

12

13

involved in this case -- I think it was 5/l000ths of the

14

parcel, and when people --

QUESTION:

Yes, but it doesn't go to the extent

of the interest.

17

than the extent of the interest, or at least as much to

18

the value of the land as the extent of the interest,

19

right?

It goes to the value of the land more

MR. FELDMAN:

21

QUESTION:

It goes --

I mean, you could have a pretty big

22

chunk of an interest of worthless land and -- you know,

23

worthless for anything except perhaps camping on it.

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but Congress was trying to

define a category of land that was really causing the

1

problem, and in the amended version of the act it acted

2

much more closely and precisely to target that particular

3

land.

4

For example, by referring to land that's capable

5

of earning $100 rather than land that had in a certain

6

year earned $100, someone whose land might escheat might

7

go into a court and say, well, this can be harvested for

8

timber every 15 years, therefore I can lease the land to

9

somebody for a 15-year period, and if the annual rental on

10

that lease will result in more than $100 for me, then I'm

11

out of the statute.

12

capable-of-earning standard as much as focusing on the

13

5 years versus 1 year that was significant.

14

QUESTION:

It's -- it was really the change to a

I must admit, one has to marvel at

15

the prognosticative ability, or else the serendipity of

16

the Congress, that 3 years before our opinion in Hodel it

17

should pass a statute which happens to solve the very

18

things we were troubled with in Hodel.

19

statute which happens to solve the very things we were

20

troubled with in Hodel.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

It should pass a

Well, I think that in fact the two

22

key things that the Court pointed out in Hodel that it was

23

most concerned about were first that this -- taking just

24

one arbitrary year before the decedent died might really

25

result in the escheat of very valuable interest, and

1

secondly that it completely and totally abolished all

2

descent and devise, even in cases where descent and devise

3

might consolidate interests.

4

What Congress did was, it remedied the first

5

problem primarily by talking about capable of earning,

6

rather than just what it had in fact earned, and in

7

addition by setting up this 5-year window rather than just

8

1 year before the decedent's death, and it dealt with the

9

second problem by permitting devise in precisely those

10

cases where the devise would result in consolidation of

11

the property.

12

The kind of property interest that we're talking

13

about here, the smallest interest in this case, as I said,

14

was something like 5/l000ths of a percent, and people who

15

own that small of a property interest can't reasonably be

16

expected, or at least very infrequently will take enough

17

of an interest in the property to do anything with it

18

to

QUESTION:

I don't know that we said in Hodel

20

that there wasn't enough of a need.

21

we said in Hodel is simply, you -- an essential part of

1

read the Court's opinion, what it was speaking of was the

2

complete and total and absolute abrogation of rights of

3

descent and devise.

4

After all, the Court reaffirmed a long line of

5

precedent that had held that the Government has very broad

6

authority to regulate the rules of descent and devise.

7

this case, this kind of rule is analogous both to typical

8

escheat rules, which are kind of abandonment rules, where

9

you have a very small interest, you can't really expect

In

10

the owner to do anything, he doesn't have enough of an

11

economic incentive to ever do anything with the property,

12

even to return a post card, perhaps, that -- where someone

13

proposes a use of the property that requires his consent,

14

and what Congress was saying was, if that's the kind of

15

interest you have, that is imposing serious costs on the

16

community, and we're going to presume that you abandoned

17

it unless you did one of three things.

18

Either, during your lifetime, you unite it with

19

another interest and consolidate your interest and get

20

above the 2 percent threshold, or second, you can dispose

21

of the property during your lifetime and thereby -- and

22

pass on -- you can certainly pass on any money that you're

23

able to realize by disposing it to your heirs by descent

24

or devise, or however it can be passed on, or three, you

25

can pass it on by -- through -- after your death, through

1

a probate proceeding, but you can only devise it to

2

somebody who already owns an interest in the same

3

property.
QUESTION:

4

Doesn't that effectively mean that

5

you can't devise it to the people you are most likely to

6

want to devise it to?

7

I mean, I presume it is highly unlikely that the

8

people who are already owners of the parcel are related to

9

you, or lineal descendants of yours, so I suppose that

10

really cancels out most of the prospective devises,

11

doesn't it?
MR. FELDMAN:

12

I actually don't think that's

13

true.

14

six respondents got three properties that she wouldn't

15

otherwise have gotten, because she was a daughter of the

16

decedent, and she already owned interest in those

17

properties.

18

As a matter of fact, in this very case one of the

But more generally, what's caused the problem

19

that Congress was addressing here was kind of -- was rules

20

of descent, was primarily rules of descent that allowed

21

the land to be fractionated over the years, and frequently

22

the land will be held within a given lineal family.

23

Perhaps it's branched out quite a bit by the time it gets

24

to the third or fourth generation.

MR. FELDMAN:

1

So generally it will be other --

2

or at least, very frequently it will be other people who

3

you do have a family tie to, who are -QUESTION:

4

But you're talking about collateral

5

heirs, a quite distant relationship if you get to the

6

third or fourth generation, aren't you?
MR. FELDMAN:

7

You might be.

You might well be,

8

although as I said in this case one of the people was a

9

daughter, but certainly many of them, some of the other

10

five didn't get any land on that basis, and didn't already

11

own interest in the parcels.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Feldman, I don't read Hodel as

13

resting upon the total elimination of the ability to

14

devise.

15

regulation here amounts to virtually the abrogation of the

16

right to pass on a certain type of property, the small,

17

undivided interest, to one heir -- to one's heirs.

18

totally, virtually.

It just doesn't say that.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FELDMAN:

It says -- it says the

Not

Right, and --

And it does virtually that here, too.
And the Court -- I would say the

22

Court also said in Hodel the difference in this case from

23

the other cases that the Court reaffirmed that have

24

affirmed the authority of the sovereign to set rules of

25

descent and devise, the difference in this case is the

1

fact that descent and devise are completely abolished.

2

Indeed, they are abolished even in circumstances where the

3

governmental purpose sought to be advanced does not

4

conflict with the further descent of the property.

5

But I think, stepping aside for a minute,

6

whether the Court's -- and, indeed, I think the question

7

before the Court today is the question of whether Hodel

8

rested on the complete abrogation of descent or devise, or

9

rested on a rule that would much more severely restrict

10
11

the sovereign's ability to regulate descent or devise.
QUESTION:

With respect to that, Mr. Feldman, I

12

was trying to think of any other kind of regulation by the

13

sovereign of the right to dispose of property on death

14

that would be comparable to this, and you rely on the

15

large power of the sovereign to regulate the disposition

16

of property on death, and here the regulation says most

17

lineal descendants will not qualify.

18

anything that would be close to this.

I couldn't think of

19

Is there any -- you talk about a larger

20

authority, but is there anything that so severely

21

restricts the category of potential devisees?

22

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think -- there's nothing I

23

can -- I can't answer that I can give you an example of

24

any particular statute that does -- that restricts the

25

category of lineal devisees so thoroughly, although there

1

may be statutes that give -- include -- they give an

2

interest to a spouse, for example, over the interests of

3

children, or something like that, that could in some

4

circumstances have that effect, but there have been, and

5

the Court have upheld statutes that have restricted devise

6

to one's children.

7

Under the common law, I believe, you couldn't

8

devise property to an alien, real property, and even if

9

the alien happened to be your child, and this Court has

10
11

upheld that.
In addition, there are in -- there are rules

12

that some Indian tribes have that you can't devise -- that

13

you can't devise property --

14

QUESTION:

But most of them come up as except --

15

in the main, you can devise your property, but there are

16

these exceptions, and here is in the main you can't,

17

unless you come under the exception of somebody who

18

already has a share of that same parcel.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

And I think you really have to

20

look at the unique character of this property interest,

21

the kinds of property interests that we're talking about

22

in this case.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FELDMAN:

25

Why is it unique?
It's unique because these

interests are extremely small fractional interests, a kind

1

of fractional interest that very, very rarely exists

2

outside of Indian law, and that the owners may well in

3

fact have abandoned the property.
It's very hard to tell whether they've abandoned

4
5

the property because the administrative costs of leasing

6

it insofar as it's able to be leased, or doing it with

7

whatever can be done are borne by the United States, and

8

because they're not subject to State taxes, and really one

9

of -- what -- meanwhile this interest is both -- I think

10

it's analogous both to cases where Congress is saying

11

owning this kind of an interest is in itself a kind of a

12

nuisance that has to be abated, and if you don't take

13

State action, you don't take action to abate that nuisance

14

in the course of your lifetime by -QUESTION:

15

It was a nuisance that Congress

16

created by -- principally by prohibiting the Indians from

17

deeding this property.

18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

QUESTION:

Isn't that how it all came about?
Well, I --

Weren't there severe limits on the

20

alienation of it by the Indians?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

22

23

There are limits on the alienation

of it -QUESTION:

So Congress gives this property to

24

the Indians, puts these severe limitations on it which

25

creates this problem of fractionalization, and then comes

2

which we've created, we're going to take it away from you.
MR. FELDMAN:

3

I'm not sure that it's fair,

4

though, to say that Congress created -- the process of

5

fractionalization may have been a byproduct of a number of

6

different factors, one among them are the fact that it's

7

not subject to State taxes, and that the Government bears

8

the cost of administering the property, and thereby it

9

doesn't give anybody an incentive to determine whether

10

this is property that they really want, and really want to

11

do something with, or if this is just abandoned property

12

that they're just going to ignore and pass on to the next

13

generation in equal undivided interests.

15

purchase these small interests, or take them by eminent

Government also could help the tribes do just that.
MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, although the

21

magnitude of the problem -- you know, each of these

22

interests -- in this case some of the interests are an

23

estimated value of $5, or $10, or $15, but the magnitude

of the problem over millions of acres of Indian land,

MR. FELDMAN:

Actually, I'm sure there's room

for improvement in the statutory schemes here, but in the

Indian Land Consolidation Act and some of the other

10

provisions that are right, I think -- this is codified at

11

29 U.S.C. 2206 at 2205, 4, 3 -- there are some other

12

provisions Congress enacted to enable tribes to take a

13

variety of actions to purchase land or to consolidate

14

interests on the reservation.

15

And in fact in 2206(c), I think it is, the very

16

section we're talking about, Congress specifically

17

indicated that if a tribe wanted to adopt a code of

18

inheritance that would deal with -- that would also deal

19

with this fractionation problem in some other way, that

that could be approved by the Secretary --

Would that violate the

I'm sorry, that no --

Just, all property owned by any

member of the tribe shall escheat to the tribe at death,

7

but would not interfere with the owner's right to dispose

8

of it inter vivos at any time during the 20 years.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

Would

I think it would under this

11

Court's decision in Hodel, in fact, at least, and insofar

12

as that was based on prior cases, I think it would violate

13

the Takings Clause on that basis as well.

14

There really wasn't -- although there really

15

wasn't an alternative for Congress' action that it took in

16

this case, by -- section 2206 does two things.

fractional interests.

First, it

In doing that, the Court itself in Hodel

20

suggested that that's something that Congress may well

21

want to -- may be able to do, and indeed, insofar as the

22

statute has only that effect, it should be held

constitutional insofar as it affects people who didn't go

Well, does the amended statute

It doesn't do that, but if you

that will happen.

because if somebody who has an interest, passes it to his

that it's going to result in -- it's almost certain to

MR. FELDMAN:

--in the tribe.
Well, insofar as it deals with

13

just very small fractionated interests, our argument is

14

that it would be constitutional, but if a statute like

that also applied to, for instance, entire interests in

MR. FELDMAN:

All intestate.

Yes.
All intestate descent.

I think it

6

would focus far more broadly than is necessary or

7

suggested, but I think the Court -- there would be

8

authority for that kind of an outcome, if Congress did not

9

act too broadly.
For example, in United States v. Locke, and in

10
11

Texaco v.. Short, the Court dealt with cases that involved

12

people who, in order to maintain a very real ownership

13

interest -- in this case I think it was mineral leases --

14

they had to take some kind of action like filing a paper

15

or something like that with a recorder of deeds.

16

If that kind of thing were required, if a will

17

were seen as equivalent to taking that kind of action,

then I think a statute like that would be constitutional.

But if you're going to abolish

I don't know why you couldn't similarly -- if

the property owner has plenty of notice, plenty of time to

prepare his or her affairs, say you must dispose of it

inter vivos in order to preserve the value, and then you

Right.

Indeed, the will in this

case, actually a number, maybe 15 or so of the interests

who just got them as a result of a residuary clause in the

Are any of the Indian lands in

Suppose three or

land, do they have a remedy of partition?
MR. FELDMAN:

Under some circumstances, yes.

12

All I can say is that there's dispute as to whether it can

be done -- it requires a majority of the ownership

14

interests in order to seek partition, or whether it

requires all the owners to agree to partition.

Well, they'd want to sell it and

partitioning as a practical matter is not really a

solution to the problem, because taking a parcel of land,

especially with the size of some of these ownership

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

I think --

-- or wouldn't happen, or couldn't?
I think the reasons is because in

10

order to partition -- I suppose one reason is that it is

11

thought that you don't want to just dispossess all of

12

these Indians of their land because perhaps some owner of

a very small interest doesn't -- wants to have it

partitioned.

owner, say, of three-quarters of a tract to buy out

fractions from the other quarter, but for someone with

have quite different incentives.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right, and also the one

21

other thing I'd add is that this land is -- the

22

administrative expenses of upkeep of the land are borne by

and therefore you don't have some of the incentives of why

fractionated would want to partition it, so you can just
deal with those problems.
QUESTION:

All of this just seems to me to say

the Government has created an economic wonderland which
has caused this problem.
The normal market economic incentives that stop
fractionalization have been taken away by the Government,
and now the Government comes in with this ham-handed
approach of simply solving the problem by denying the
right to devise, and I don't know why it couldn't solve
the problem just as readily by letting the normal
incentives of the market come back into the picture.
MR. FELDMAN:

I suppose the only answer is that

because of -- it really goes to the whole history of
Indian law and all of the purposes that are served by
holding the land in trust and maintaining an Indian land
base that is a much more complex problem that just saying,
let's take the land out of trust or whatever we would have
to do and treat this like any other land.
QUESTION:

No, but let's take one of the

mechanisms.
It's perfectly true that for these minuscule
interests it may be very cumbersome even to get the ball
rolling by going into court in the normal course, filing
petitions and so on.

1

But the Government can certainly provide a

2

simplified partition scheme, for example, that would, I

3

suppose, just allow an extremely simple filing before an

4

administrative officer with a low filing fee or none at

5

all, and that would be a way of bringing a kind of normal

6

market mechanism adapted to the particular problem that

7

the Government has caused.

8

Why can't the Government do something like that?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

There -- I suppose that there are

10

partition schemes, there are partition regulations that we

11

cite in our brief that are currently applicable to this

12

land that allow partition in some circumstances.

13

But I suppose the problem is that the land,

14

many, many people have attachments to land, especially

15

some of the larger landowners, and they don't necessarily

16

want their land partitioned, and it's important for the

17

Government to keep the land as part of -- it's not

18

important for the Government, it's important for the --

19

for Indian policy to have the land maintained in trust for

20

the Indians, and that carries with it a lot of other

baggage that you can't just -- you can't just discard to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RENE A. MARTELL

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MARTELL:

3
4

please the Court:
We're here today to discuss the effects of the

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

amendments on the Hodel decision.

7

Mr. Youpee left 34 parcels to six of his

8

children, and he left them in such a fashion that each

9

child would be sole owner of the parcel that he left.

He

10

pretty much is now put in the position that the plaintiffs

11

were in the Hodel decision.
The amended act does not cure the problems

12

13

pointed out by the Court in the Hodel decision, and it

14

wasn't until 1992 that this -- Congress decided to have,

15

again, hearings on the fractionalization problem, and in

16

1994 the Secretary distributed for comment new amendments

17

that had -- the heart of it, of which was a revolving

18

money fund to pay for these interests.

19

One of the problems that remains with the

20

amendments now is that the amendments still try to

21

categorize the land as de minimis by considering only the

22

income that they generate, whereas the Court in Hodel say

23

the proper determination is the land's actual economic

24

value.

25

The economic value here is that $2,100 of

1

these -- is what these parcels are worth.

That's a

2

significant sum of money, and it's significant in

3

Roosevelt County, which is one of the poorest counties in

4

Montana.
Mr. Youpee's property interests, if they were

5
6

partitioned, in 10 of those parcels those interests would

7

be between 2 and 6 acres, so as the Court has said -QUESTION:

8

9
10

Two and 6 acres in each parcel, or

total?
MR. MARTELL:

When I divided his -- the acreage

11

by his interest, in one parcel it was 6 acres, in four

12

other parcels, those were 4-acre tracts, and in three

13

other parcels those tracts were in excess of 2 acres, so a

14

taking even of small land is still a taking.

15

Under the amendments, at 25 U.S.C. 2206(c), it

16

appears that if the tribe wants to have a consolidation

17

program and pay -- and -- excuse me, a consolidation

18

program and have -- add within their code how they're

19

going to treat descent and distribution, and that code

20

disenfranchises nonmember Indians and non-Indians, that

21

they have to pay fair market value for those interests

22

that they get as a tribe.

23

The second problem here is that the option of

24

inter vivos transfers do not cure the taking.

It is only through a devise of his land that he

2

would be able to, and that's only if his children are

3

already owners.
QUESTION:

4

Well, why would that be, Mr. Martell?

5

I would think that if he knows who he might devise it to,

6

which among his children, he might also make an inter

7

vivos transfer to those children, unless he's dependent

8

upon income from the property.
MR. MARTELL:

9
10

He wasn't dependent on income.

It's just such a headache to do it, and to know -QUESTION:

11

Well, but surely

it's every -- it's

12

no bigger a headache todevise it inter -- or to

They did

Bureau for assistance in their legal affairs and dealing

2

with their property?
MR. MARTELL:

3

Correct, Your Honor.

In 1981 he

4

went to the regional, the area office in Billings, away

5

from the reservation, and had the chief realty officer

6

draw up his will, and it was retained there, and at no

7

time after 1981 was he ever told that his devises would be

8

ineffective.

9

QUESTION:

There's no explanation of that in the

10

record, is there, why they wouldn't have been advised that

11

the devises didn't comply with the statute?
MR. MARTELL:

12

No.

It's just a reality.

Nobody

13

knows about this law, and nobody is told about this law.

14

It's just not happening.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

Suppose they had passed -- suppose

17

the system were totally different, the administrative

18

system, and what had happened is, every person who has one

19

of these interests got a big piece of paper.

signature on that, it says, if you check B, proceed to

2

page 3 and sign that, and it happened on page 3 and 2 is

3

all the necessary stuff for an inter vivos transfer, i.e.,

4

all the necessary stuff for a trust, and you set up the

5

trust, and then at your death it goes to the beneficiary.

6

You know, all those things were all there.
So they'd gotten total notice, they'd gotten

7
8

exactly how to do it, their wishes would be carried out.

9

It's not that hard to work out.

10

Then would this be

unconstitutional?
MR. MARTELL:

11

I don't think it would be a due

12

process problem, but I think there would still be a

13

problem in that the land is not compensated.

14

QUESTION:

Well then, why could a State ever,

15

for example, say traditional dower rights are, the wife

16

got one-third of a life estate in the husband's property.

17

We think that's out of date, so we pass a statute that as

18

to the future the wife or husband is to have one-half of

19

the property acquired during marriage.

20

States the same as the community property States, into the

21

future.

Could that never occur --

process, you knew about the process, and you chose not to

do it.

Then perhaps the property would be abandoned.

QUESTION:

19

MR. MARTELL:

20

It's abandoned.
But that's -- people here don't

about the process.

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's what I'm trying --

QUESTION:

Do any of the tribes impose any kind

23

of a property tax on these lands, or are they permitted to

MR. MARTELL:

Not that I know of, Your Honors.

1

Some tribes do have consolidation programs, but -QUESTION:

2

Because, of course, with non-Indian

3

property there are State and local taxes applicable, and

4

if the owner doesn't pay them for a period of time, there

5

are procedures that the State or county can go through to

6

forfeit the property for nonpayment of taxes.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Martell, regarding Justice

8

Breyer's question about changing the escheat law, or

9

changing the inheritance laws, I suppose there's a

10

difference, is there not, for purpose of takings law, as

11

to whether you have a general State law or Federal law

12

that is applicable to all property owners versus a law

13

that simply picks out a few property owners, or one class

14

of property.

15

For example, I think we'd have a different

16

question before us if on the one hand the State law said,

17

property escheats in just 2 years instead of 8 throughout

18

the State, versus a law that picks out a particular class

19

of property owners and just says, we're going to make an

20

exception from the normal State law for you, and your

21

property shall escheat more quickly.

22

takings issue in the latter case when there isn't in the

23

former.

It's one targeted at a particular class of property-

MR. MARTELL:

Correct, Your Honor,

I would maintain that that's pretty much the essence

QUESTION:

But the Government has a great deal

of authority under the Constitution over the affairs of

10

the Indian tribes.

I don't think the Federal Government

11

could step in and prescribe a general partition statute

12

that would be contrary to the laws of all of the 50

What is it that you say to the Government's

the same as Hodel rather than, as the Government says,

different.

9

It's on the books.

MR. MARTELL:

Okay.

It's a hard

Now, tell us why this is

It's the same as Hodel

10

because Mr. Youpee has no options.

11

his complex -- during his lifetime a -- you know, a series

12

of complex transfers, and the Court in Hodel said

13

that's -- you know, that's not a substitute for the rights

14

that's taken.

15

I mean, his option,

His right that is taken is, he can't -- his land

16

cannot descend, and he cannot leave it to his children,

17

because devise has to be limited to a coowner, and a

18

reality is, as was pointed out before, children don't

19

inherit land at the same time their parents do.

20

Indians, when they receive land, receive it through

Have there been, to your knowledge, any such tribal codes?

MR. MARTELL:

No, Your Honor.

Anything that

QUESTION:

So that significant change turns out

still to be undeveloped and unused.

MR. MARTELL:
QUESTION:

10

Correct, Your Honor.

I gather the tribes don't care.

The

11

owners of the small, fractionated interests don't care.

12

The only person who cares is the Government, who's saddled

13

with the enormous administrative burden of keeping track

14

of all of these fractionated interests.

MR. MARTELL:

MR. MARTELL:

1

They care about it, but there's

2

such an overwhelming bureaucracy there that it's hard to

3

make headway into it.

4

hard to make headway into 34 parcels if the people that

you were talking to weren't receptive to doing it, and

that's the reality of it.

8

you know that perhaps you should do that.

9

I mean, it -- I mean, it would be

I mean, they don't want to

We have considered in our argument that under

10

the amendments there is still a problem, as -- exactly as

11

there was in Hodel, that for Indians under 18 and those

12

incompetent, that they -- they're totally just -- are just

13

like the plaintiffs in Hodel, is that devise and descent

14

are totally abrogated for them.

15

We feel that the escheat provision is in fact a

16

categorical taking, because as I mentioned, Mr. Youpee has

17

no options.

18

the amendments leave him no choice.

19

he could leave it to a coowner, but that will not be his

20

children, and he could do inter vivos transfers, but

21

that's --as the Court said, that's not an effective

substitute for losing the right of devise and descent, so

in effect his land is transferred to a tribe without his

consent.

purpose that comes out time and again in the legislative

prohibit further fractionalization?
MR. MARTELL:

I don't think they can prohibit it

unless they pay for it.
QUESTION:

Okay.

I didn't find that you took a

position in your briefs.

6

MR. MARTELL:

7

QUESTION:

That's --

Why would there be a payment

8

requirement there?

I would suppose that precluding

9

further fractionalization was not going to make the land

10

worth less, so you're saying the value would be simply the

11

value of the capacity to fractionize.

12

MR. MARTELL:

13

QUESTION:

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

Mr. Martell, I'm surprised, because I

14

thought you told me that you thought it would be a

15

legitimate restriction for the Government to say to

16

Mr. Youpee or anyone else, you can give each parcel that

17

you have to one person, or to that many different people

18

as you have parcels, but you cannot take that one parcel

19

and turn that parcel into two.

20

I thought in answer to my question you said,

21

that's right, that would be the kind of restriction that

22

we wouldn't attack as a taking.

23

MR. MARTELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

Correct, Your Honor.

And then you seemed to give a

different response to Justice O'Connor.

I thought you accepted that you can freeze the
size of the parcel as they now are.

MR. MARTELL:

4

QUESTION:

6

Okay.

I guess I --

And no further division, and that

would be okay.
MR. MARTELL:

I guess I was confused.

I mean,

7

it seems that as long as he doesn't lose his land, that

8

that would be a legitimate way to do it.

9

QUESTION:

So I guess that means that a number

10

of applications of this very statute would be permissible,

11

although the one involving your clients would not be,

12

because this statute will prevent that.

13

further fractionalization, as I understand it.

14

MR. MARTELL:

It prevents

But I would think it -- I guess

15

I'm getting confused.

16

be -- you know, if you're taking somebody's land and not

17

paying for it, then it's not permissible.

18

QUESTION:

I mean, I don't think it would ever

There are a lot of -- there are

19

statutes in different countries that -- and that's what I

20

was -- this case differs from the last case in that here

21

there is a set of people whom you can leave the property

22

to and a set to whom you cannot leave it to.

23

difference, right?

24

MR. MARTELL:

25

QUESTION:

That's the

Right.

Okay.

Well, there are a lot of land

things like that.

leave this land, or you cannot leave this part of your

4

estate to anyone but your first child, or to anyone but

5

the children.

They say, you can leave -- you cannot

They already have an interest in it.

Or you have to leave a certain amount to your

wife, or you have -- those are traditional, and that's why

8

I was trying to see., is there anything in those cases

9

that -- suppose we wanted to move towards some of those

10

kinds of rules.

I don't know that any State would or

11

wouldn't, but this sounds a little bit like that.
MR. MARTELL:

12

It seems like most of the State

13

laws that deal with -- you know, with forced heirs like

14

that are doing it for the benefit of the family.

QUESTION:

Right, and here they say, you see the

tribe is like your family.

But not for the benefit of Mr.

Youpee's.

We're doing it for the benefit

No, and that's also true if you don't

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

I suppose if the forced heir was the

Nation of France, that might be a different question.

MR. MARTELL:

QUESTION:

Either from a different reservation,

or in some cases different tribes, isn't that possible?

MR. MARTELL:

reservations involved.

9

Correct.

Right, Your Honor.

There's three

We would argue that Mr. Youpee's right of

descent is vested because this is an Indian law case, and

11

his right of descent was in -- was part of the bundled

12

rights that was understood to be taken to the General

13

Allotment Act, so the General Allotment Act had as its

14

purpose to start the Americanization of Indians, and

15

therefore the right to be -- of descent was a vested

16

traditional property right that the Indians understood

17

they had when they took the land.

QUESTION:

How large an area is the Fort Peck

reservation, and how many of the tribe reside on it?

20

MR. MARTELL:

21

boundaries it's a million acres.

22

Indian ownership is about 51 percent, and there's about

5,000 people, 5,000 Indians.
