CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 96-292, Marian Johnson v. Kristine Fankell.
Mr. Gilmore.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. GILMORE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

9

MR. GILMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Today the Court is presented with the question

11

whether the qualified immunity defense is as powerful in

12

State courts as it is in Federal courts, or whether its

13

scope and its protection may vary among the States, or

14

between Federal district courts and one State, and State

15

trial courts in the same State.

16

Thirty-six States are involved in this, between

17

the amicus and the petitioners, because of the importance

18

of the qualified immunity defense to the practical

19

functioning of State government, and because of the value

20

of this defense to the employees and officers of State and

21

local governments throughout the Nation.

22

QUESTION:

Do you think, Mr. Gilmore, that if

23

the Idaho legislature had a mended its judicial code to

24

allow appeals in this kind of case that you say the

25

Federal statute requires the supreme court of Idaho would

2

have entertained this appeal?
MR. GILMORE:

That's a very difficult question

3

to answer, Your Honor, because the Idaho supreme court in

4

three instances had ruled that its court rules take

5

precedence over statutes in the area of conflict in rules

6

of procedure, rules of evidence, and rules regarding a

7

special statutory court that was established to adjudicate

8

water rights in the Snake River basin.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But it hasn't extended -- the court

has not said the same with respect to appellate rules?
MR. GILMORE:

12

not addressed that.

13

QUESTION:

That is an open question.

It has

Well, it seemed to -- you know, the

14

one sense -- I believe in one sense orders seemed to say

15

this was not a final, whatever it is that the Idaho

16

stature requires.

17

My concern is that since these qualified

18

immunity is designed to protect State officials I would

19

think the Idaho legislature could probably extend the

20

appeal right if it wanted to.

21

MR. GILMORE:

I simply cannot concede that,

22

because the entire recent jurisprudence in Idaho has been

23

for the State supreme court to say its rules preempt

24

statutes are inconsistent.

25

QUESTION:

But in any case, however the State

1

speaks, whether it speaks through the legislature or it

2

speaks through the supreme court, there is an agency of

3

the State which is capable of valuing the State's interest

4

here, and if it believes that the State's interest really

5

does require the appealability of a qualified immunity

6

ruling, there's some agency of a State that can say,

7

that's the regime we will have.
MR. GILMORE:

8

The Idaho supreme court could

9

adopt an appellate rule that would explicitly provide for

10

appealability of denial of absolute or qualified immunity

11

motions.

12

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

So that ultimately the responsibility

for the nonappealability is with the State itself.
MR. GILMORE:

It is with one of the branches of

State government.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, what do you say to the

17

argument that the justification for immediate

18

appealability is a justification which rests ultimately

19

not on individual interests but on State interests, and

20

therefore, if the State doesn't want to take advantage of

21

it, why, indeed, should a Federal court interfere with

22

that decision?

23

MR. GILMORE:

Because the defendants in this

24

case, or the petitioners here, are sued in their

25

individual capacities.

They are not sued as State

officers, as such, in their official capacity.
QUESTION:

2

But if they were merely individuals

3

there wouldn't be any kind of immunity

4

5

that they have this qualified immunity.

7

That is correct, only governmental

officers.
QUESTION:

8

9

It's only because they're State officers

MR. GILMORE:

6

that they could

But let me ask one anterior question

about where the rule-making authority is.

I don't recall

10

the Idaho counterpart to 1292(b) that gives the discretion

11

only at the appellate level, is that a rule of the court,

12

that the courts made up, or is it a legislative enactment?

13

MR. GILMORE:

It's Rule 12(a) of the Idaho

14

supreme court, and the Idaho supreme court decision of

15

Todd v. Budell states that that was modeled upon 1292.

16
17

QUESTION:

But the source of it is the Idaho

supreme court, not the Idaho legislature?

18

MR. GILMORE:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

What was your answer to Justice

20

Souter?

I mean, I take it quite specifically, why are the

21

States filing amicus briefs?

22

mean, there's no Federal interest here.

23

wants to subject its people to good procedural advantage,

24

they can.

25

Government doesn't care, so what's the answer to that?

It's up to the States.

If they don't, they don't.

I

If the State

1

That's what I take it
MR. GILMORE:

2

The answer to that is, the State

3

officers who the Attorney General must represent want to

4

assert these personal defenses that you have held as a

5

matter of Federal law -QUESTION:

6

What is it as a matter of -- no,

I

7

take it the Federal law is that 1983,

in giving liability,

8

imposing liability,

9

things, doesn't reach as far as the area where what the

in helping plaintiffs attain certain

10

State person did was lawful or uncertain.

It only reaches

11

the area where what the State officer did was clearly

12

illegal.

Now, that's what this Court has held often.
Qualified immunity in fact arose under State

13
14

law, and Congress bought into it, so that's the Federal

15

interest.

16

all by some States giving these people some procedural

17

advantage and others not?

18

22

How is that Federal interest hurt in any way at

MR. GILMORE:

In a literal sense, the Federal

interest is not hurt.
QUESTION:

Well,

if that's so, then isn't that

the end of the matter, because -- well, why not?
MR. GILMORE:

Because -- because all of these

23

officers of the State of Idaho are Federal citizens and

24

have citizens'

25

could be indifferent to all kinds of -- all kinds of

rights.

I suppose,

unless it enacts a law to take care of them.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Gilmore --

4

MR. GILMORE:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I thought that the qualified

6

immunity Federal rule did not just apply to Federal

7

officers but also applied to State officers.

8

9
10

MR. GILMORE:

It applies to all State, local,

Federal Government officers.
QUESTION:

So then there is some Federal

11

interest, or at least when we discerned that rule we

12

thought that was, or when Congress enacted the statutes

13

relying on prior historical practice Congress thought

14

there was a Federal interest in allowing State officers to

15

have immunity.

16

MR. GILMORE:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

There's

We do give State officers immunity in

Federal courts, don't we?
MR. GILMORE:

Yes.

There's a Federal interest

20

that's been described in both the Bivens cases and the

21

1983 cases, preventing unfounded distraction of Government

22

officers and disruption of effective Government.

23

QUESTION:

All of those --

24

QUESTION:

Suppose a State were to say that we

25

don't -- for State law purposes have this immunity.

that his State as a matter of State policy thinks the

officer should not have?
MR. GILMORE:

No.

Under 1983, would the

precedent, State officers can only claim Federal

immunities, not State immunities.

case -QUESTION:

9

For example, in this

No, I mean his 1983 immunity which he

10

would get is a Federal source, but the State says, just as

11

municipalities can waive their sovereign immunity, that we

12

don't want our officers to be any less responsible than

13

anyone else for the torts they commit, so our officers

14

will not be shielded by immunity.

15

Now, would there be a Federal interest in

16

saying, State, in defiance of your policies, we are going

17

to insist that in 1983 cases these people be shielded by

18

qualified immunity?

19

MR. GILMORE:

Yes.

I think there are several

Federal interests.

court and the State courts in the same State.

QUESTION:

Yes, and that's the interest --

As part of the contours of the

right.

The liability of the officer personally does not

QUESTION:

The Federal Government has an

But you're saying the Federal

interest, then, is superior, that even though a State can

waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State cannot

MR. GILMORE:

2

QUESTION:

An immunity.

Say Federal statutes allow me or you

3

or anybody to sue certain groups of people under myriad

4

circumstances, and in each of those statutes there are

5

thousands and thousands of ways in which the person might

6

not be liable.

That's because the statute doesn't cover

7

the situation.

Is there then some Federal interest in

8

making certain that the procedures that are used to decide

9

each way he's not liable is going to be the same in every

10

State, the Federal Government?

11

MR. GILMORE:

12

QUESTION:

No.

Because that's the problem I have.

13

Once I see the case that way, and I have -- obviously have

14

been seeing it that way.

15

it difficult to articulate the Federal interest.

16

MR. GILMORE:

Once I see it that way, I find

The Federal interest is in

17

preservation of the State actors' Federal immunities

18

created under Federal law, and the prevention of a loss of

19

those Federal immunities.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask a hypothetical question?

21

Do you think the State could pass a statute that was

22

patterned after 1983 and said, State court shall entertain

23

claims for violations of Federal constitutional rights and

24

everything else the same as in 1983, and add to it, and

25

the State -- and the defendant shall not be allowed to

4

plead qualified immunity?
MR. GILMORE:

I think the State would have the

constitutional authority to pass such a statute.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the Federal courts --

5

what if Congress passed a law saying, unlike the law as

6

written at present, that when we say there can only be an

7

appeal from the final judgment, we mean it, and there are

8

no exceptions.

9

can't give that effect in a Federal court?

10

Is there some constitutional reason why we

MR. GILMORE:

If Federal law prohibited appeal

11

from qualified immunity motions from the denial of

12

qualified immunity motions in the Federal courts, we would

13

not be here today.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but we've just given them a

15

right in the Federal courts to appeal based on an

16

interpretation of the law that Congress has applied, not

17

as a matter of constitutional law, have we?

18

MR. GILMORE:

No, I do not believe the qualified

19

immunity defense has been characterized as a matter of

20

constitutional law.

21

QUESTION:

What if the double jeopardy defense,

22

which, you know, has more of a constitutional basis,

23

obviously, than qualified immunity, in the Abney case that

24

we decided some time ago, we said a defendant could appeal

25

that in the Federal system on an interlocutory basis.

Do

1

you think Congress could say, no, we're not going to allow

2

that kind of an appeal?

3

MR. GILMORE:

I am not an expert in this area of

4

relations between Federal courts and the Federal Congress,

5

but for the purposes of this case, I think I would say

6

yes, only to try to outline the contours of what we're

7

looking for.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GILMORE:

10

QUESTION:

Congress could regulate.
Congress --

On that subject, it seems to me that

11

if you prevail here, States must give Abney appeals in all

12

double jeopardy cases.

13

MR. GILMORE:

Do the States generally do that?
When I did my research in that

14

area, a majority of the States that I was able to identify

15

allowed an Abney appeal, and then there was a further

16

safety valve.

17

are no -- in which there are States located that have not

18

allowed Abney appeals, have found an exception to Younger

19

abstention and have handled the practical difficulties of

20

dealing with double jeopardy claims in the State courts by

21

proceeding to enjoin the criminal prosecution.

22

Three of the circuits in cases where there

QUESTION:

Well, it does follow from your

23

position here, I suppose, that Abney appeals would be

24

mandated on the States in all double jeopardy cases if you

25

prevail here.

It would seem to me a parallel principle,

1

perhaps a principle of even more importance, as the Chief

2

Justice has indicated.

3

MR. GILMORE:

I think there are theoretical

4

parallels.

5

sense that I've just been talking about.

6

may be an existing safety valve that the circuits have

7

created.

8

9

There may be practical differences in the

QUESTION:

There already

But if the -- this is a right that

does have a constitutional underpinning, double jeopardy,

10

and I think the precedent you cited said States might very

11

well want to adopt that policy as their own, but it seemed

12

to me it wasn't your brief, it was I think the State's

13

brief in support of you that just cited Abney and -- sort

14

of en passant, but that would be a pretty big thing to

15

say, yes, we want the officer to be shielded here in 1983,

16

even though we recognize the price might be that the

17

States no longer have a choice that some of them thought

18

they had about double jeopardy.

19

MR. GILMORE:

I think if you look at the

20

Kentucky amicus, that is something the Court must weigh in

21

the balance, but I would hesitate to say that the Court

22

must reach that issue in this proceeding I think because

23

of the practicalities of administration of Abney, in

24

particular, modification in Richardson with the notion of

25

a colorable double jeopardy claim.

QUESTION:

1

There's another oddity here that in

2

addition to the States saying their own State court is not

3

sufficiently the guardian of the State officer's rights,

4

it's that these cases are removal by the defendant, are

5

they not?

6

being less generous to the defendant, why couldn't the

7

defendant remove?
MR. GILMORE:

8

9
10

So if you're complaining about Idaho procedure

At the time this case was brought,

we had no reason to believe Idaho procedure would be less
generous, and there are practical reasons -QUESTION:

11

Well, you didn't know about that they

12

had this final judgment, firm final judgment rule and that

13

they didn't allow interlocutory appeals except in

14

specified cases?

15

MR. GILMORE:

No.

We knew that the language of

16

Idaho Appellate Rule 11(a) was, you may take appeal from

17

judgments, orders, or decrees which are final, and this

18

was an order, and this Court's precedent had discussed the

19

finality of denial of qualified immunity orders many

20

times.
QUESTION:

21

Well, does Idaho have the collateral

22

order rule?

23

because you would have know about that one way or the

24

other.

25

Does it have it in Cohen v. Beneficial,

has never addressed Beneficial, to adopt or reject the

2

collateral order rule.

3

QUESTION:

But you could have removed -- in any

4

case, wouldn't one factor, if one wants -- if a Federal

5

court is going to tell -- if this case is going to tell

6

the State, change your procedure for these cases only,

7

that the defendant who is asking for that could have

8

gotten himself into the Federal forum.

9

MR. GILMORE:

One cannot always get in the

10

Federal forum, and many 1983 cases will be a suit against

11

a number of officers, perhaps city, county, and State, and

12

without concurrence of all the defendants, there is no

13

right of removal.

14

QUESTION:

Apart from the -- if you have

15

multiple defendants and they -- what interest would any of

16

them have in not getting into Federal court on a question

17

of the qualified immunity?

18

MR. GILMORE:

Maybe not legal interest, but

19

practical interest.

for example, were sued in State district court and

attempted to remove, the nearest Federal district

13

Wisconsin's notice of claim statute, but the answer in

there was, when you are in State court applying Federal

16

Federal law, and these defendants have the --

QUESTION:

They could have filed in Federal

Well, let me ask how far you would

18

take that, because there's one respect in which Idaho is

19

more generous in allowing interlocutory appeals, and that

20

is from a new trial order, right?

21

MR. GILMORE:

That's correct.

So suppose we had a case where a

MR. GILMORE:

2

QUESTION:

I think I understand.

Yes, so where it would be -- the

State procedure would be to the defendant's advantage to

4

take the interlocutory appeal, but we wouldn't be allowed

that in the Federal system.

9

Can the plaintiff then say, no interlocutory
appeal from the new trial?
MR. GILMORE:

That's a close call, and I can't

find anything in the Court's precedents and things like

10

FELA or 1983 to really answer that.

11

answer there is like development in FELA, or development

12

in 1983, that's going to require a case-by-case analysis.

13

I don't see that as being a black-and-white issue.

14

I guess the only

What I think is black and white is that if you

15

don't get your appeal from denial of a qualified immunity

16

motion, and you should prevail later but you've gone to

17

trial in the meantime, you've lost the benefits of your

18

qualified immunity, and that is a black-and-white issue,

19

not a gray issue.

20

I think one of the essential underpinnings that

21

we're looking for in this case is even-handedness between

22

treatments of plaintiff's rights and claims in 1983 in

23

State courts and defendant's immunities.

Both, it's time to, we think, look at the other

4

hand, look at the question of what happens to defendants

5

who find themselves in State courts for whatever

6

reasons -- they prefer the forum for convenience, they

7

can't get concurrence of all the defendants to remove to

8

Federal court -- they should be given the same benefits of

9

Federal law as plaintiffs.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Gilmore, here's what troubles me.

11

We do have language in our opinions to say that the

12

immunity right is a right not to be tried, not just a

13

right to be acquitted, or found innocent.

14

said that for the purpose of deciding whether the policy

15

expressed in 1983 was sufficient to overcome what would be

16

the normal operation of a Federal statute.

17

that it's the same question whether that policy is strong

18

enough to overcome the State's ability to manage

19

procedures in its own courts.

20

really two different questions?

21

MR. GILMORE:

However, we

I'm not sure

Don't you think they're

I don't, because I think the

22

policy we're talking about is what immunities can citizens

23

of the United States assert, and how can they protect

24

them, and that's a policy that this court says overrides

QUESTION:

No, but the procedure that's followed

2

doesn't reach the question whether you will ultimately

3

prevail on the immunity issue.

4

5

will have the burden of a trial that you will otherwise

avoid, a burden that is a burden on the State judicial

system as well as on the parties to the case, and the top

8

officers of the State judicial system say we're willing to

If you do have the

pay that price in order to save the appellate courts the
10
11

premature adjudication burden.
MR. GILMORE:

I think the answer there was given

12

in Behrens last term.

13

opinion in Behrens was that when you talk about

14

appealability you don't talk about whether you're going to

15

succeed or not succeed, whether you've got a good case or

16

a frivolous one.

17

In that case, Behrens said -- the

You talk about categories of orders.

And here is a category of order, a black and

18

white category, denial of a motion for qualified immunity,

be it 12(b) (6) or summary judgment, and that is so

20

important -- so important under Federal law that that's

considered final.

Mr. Gilmore, in the reverse situation

character to the Federal court system, and things that

2

pertain to that essential character don't give way to the

3

States.

4

I mean, think of if a State allowed an

5

interlocutory appeal whenever the lawyers liked it.

You

6

had -- you've got diversity cases certainly wouldn't have

7

the Federal courts copy that, so is there a -- should

8

there be some kind of symmetry?

9

Just as the Federal

10

court's image, the State courts ought to be allowed their

11

essential characteristics, including how firm they want

12

their final judgment rule to be.

13

MR. GILMORE:

Symmetry should hold up to the

14

Supremacy Clause and either the burdening or in this case

15

the extinguishment of a Federal immunity.

16

What we're talking about here is the complete

17

elimination of a Federal immunity of discovery from trial

18

should there be an erroneous trial court ruling, and

19

there's always going to be an asymmetry between these two

20

situations because of the Supremacy Clause.

21

QUESTION:

characterized the right which is at stake here as being a

1

which has recognized the immunity number 1, because it was

2

thought to be recognized at common law when 1983 went in,

3

and that common law background is supposedly the basis for

4

our interpretation.
But number 2, because the interest which that

5
6

immunity protects is the public or State interest against

7

having its officers made timid or distracted, and so on.
My understanding is we have never recognized the

8

9

interest as being a separate, individual interest.

The

10

individuals get the benefit because that's the necessary

11

implication of the State getting the benefit.

12

Am I right in my understanding?

MR. GILMORE:

You have always tied the

individuals' interest to their function in the State or

MR. LATTA:

It has never confronted it, and

based on the jurisprudence as -- and I believe Mr. Gilmore

Does the trial court have to give its

You look at -- there are two separate

decisions made, one by the trial judge to say yes or no,

and then the supreme court acts on its own in light of

what the trial judge has said.

5

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, then, if we were to

say that this is a substantive, very significant right,

the right to have an interlocutory ruling, then it would

be then an abuse of discretion of Idaho law not to take

MR. LATTA:

13

I would agree it could be under that

no one could tell the Idaho court that it has to take --

MR. LATTA:

Well, the -- because it is

permissive as to the Idaho supreme court, then it would

only be answerable to this Court on an abuse of discretion

theory, but the solution to the problem presented by the

permissive nature of Idaho Appellate Rule

was suggested by Justice Ginsburg earlier,

and that is

that this represents and tells us that the first

There are three Federal courtrooms

very long haul to a Federal courtroom, but if the State

believes on behalf of its actors that it must have the

How do you

distinguish that case and the reasons for it with the

MR. LATTA:

3

I take solace in the language of

Felder v. Casey, because it talks in that case of the

that there shall be an interlocutory appeal rule in State

11

MR. LATTA:

problem, and you'd better not agree with it because it

will turn out it's wrong.

when I read Felder, I thought that Felder follows from

7

MR. LATTA:

QUESTION:

I want to know why -- I mean,

That is correct.
And Felder was a case where they said

9

the plaintiff has to show that he's hurt within 120 days,

and they say that's such a short time, 120 days to notify

11

that you're hurt, that it's about the same thing, kicking

can you say a little more about well, we're plaintiffs and

they're defendants?

All right.

MR. LATTA:

I don't know if that's a correct

I mean, that, to me, doesn't work.
Well, the State interest that's

being protected by the immunity rule belongs to the

petitioners as a reason for applying this Federal rule and

QUESTION:

8

The choice of how the State is going

Well, I'm sure that's true if it's a

State -- if it's a State liability scheme, but this is a
Federal liability scheme. The Federal Government has said

10

you as a person are individually liable for violating

11

1 83, but we'll give you a defense.
MR. LATTA:

12

And the State can elect to expand on

13

that defense by paying for the Office of the Attorney

14

General to defend them or indemnifying them, or, as was

15

suggested earlier, telling the State actors when they come

16

to work, you may be subject to a civil rights case.

QUESTION:

Well, but the State of Idaho does

Very much so, yes.
So that all Idaho is denying that the

Federal courts give is the interlocutory appeal.

9

MR. LATTA:

That is correct, and the distinction

10

that's of importance here is the manner in which the

interlocutory appeal is taken in the Federal system

compared to the State system.

Then you -- I don't want to

Are you finished?
MR. LATTA:

I want you to finish.

I wanted to answer -- excuse me.

16

The interlocutory appeal under the Federal system is

pursuant to 1291 and to the Cohen collateral order

18

doctrine, and those are first ideas that a statute that

19

doesn't apply, an idea that does not -- has not been

20

accepted by the Idaho courts for application in State

courts, and that provides the complete remedy that the

objection is that we want our interlocutory appeal, the

whole answer is, the case can be, should have been removed

because that's where you know you're going to get your

interlocutory appeal.
QUESTION:

5

But why wasn't it a complete answer

6

in Felder, then, to say well, you could have filed in the

7

District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin,

8

rather than in the circuit court?
MR. LATTA:

9

My understanding of the distinction

10

here would be that if you could have filed in the Federal

11

district court in Wisconsin you would have still been

12

subject to the 120-day rule, and that was what -- that

13

limitation on bringing the State's rights was what was

14

fatally wrong with the Wisconsin notice of claim statute.
QUESTION:

15

I thought what was wrong in Felder

16

was that in the State court, by imposing the time

17

requirement, the right in effect was shrunk a little bit,

18

MR. LATTA:

1

It has been exercised, yes.

The

2

State's position, as reflected in Idaho Appellate Rule 11,

3

is that it does not want to hear interlocutory appeals,

4

and it may exercise that right with respect to the State's

5

interest.
QUESTION:

6

Well, if this is an optional thing

7

with the State, then I suppose the State could decide not

8

to accept the qualified immunity doctrine at all, if it

9

thinks its officers don't need it, right?
MR. LATTA:

10

That is correct.

They could do

11

that.

They could direct the Attorney General, perhaps

12

through legislation, likely through legislation, not to

13

assert the defense, and --

14

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose --

15

QUESTION:

If a 1983 action were brought, the

16

defendant would -- I mean, he could tell the Attorney

17

General not to, but he couldn't tell the individual who's

18

being sued for his private fortune not to assert a defense

19

that he has.

21

we don't think we need it so we're not going to let our

State officers do it.

do you?

The State

courts could say, the Federal Government's been very kind

7

to offer us this immunity defense, but speaking for the

we don't think we need it.
Well,

21

if they could do it for that element of

MR. LATTA:

At the fullest extent the answer is

You certainly don't have to take that

position to defend this case, because there's a vast

5

difference between giving up a procedural right that does

6

not affect the ultimate outcome of the case and giving up

7

a defense that would change the outcome in many, many

8

cases.

9

MR. LATTA:

0

QUESTION:

I would agree with you, Justice -And in Felder, of course, part of the

11

analysis was that the statute affected the outcome in a

12

significant number of cases, and that's not true here.

3

MR. LATTA:

That's why I looked at the

4

distinction between qualified immunity as a defense and

5

the interlocutory appeal, because irrespective of not

6

being able to exercise the interlocutory appeal that they

7

seek by imposing

8

will never go away, and it wouldn't matter what kind of a

9

recovery the plaintiff would obtain down below if the

29

on the State, the immunity defense

20

State was, in fact, immune from suit the Supreme Court

21

would so hold.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but in one respect it does go

23

away, because the one element of the immunity defense is

24

the element not to have to stand trial, and that does go

25

away.

is after trial, then you have lost that element of the

immunity, and that -- to that degree it is outcome-

3

determinative .

4

MR. LATTA:

If -- I would disagree.

We've

5

looked at that outcome-determinative issue as hard as we

6

can, and if the answer is, does it determine the outcome

of the lawsuit, the answer is no --

In that respect there is a

MR. LATTA:

There is --- that the bell cannot be unrung.
With respect to the trial bell, yes,

16

it cannot be unrung, and if you don't want to hear that

17

chimed in the background, either change Rule 11 or remove

18

it to Federal court where you're guaranteed to be in a

19

position to take the interlocutory appeal that they seek.

QUESTION:

Well,

it really doesn't deny the

MR. LATTA:

No.

You don't have to concede that the right not to

MR. LATTA:

MR. LATTA:

QUESTION:

10

Well -But you -The district court here, the District

Court of Bonner County, entertained a motion for summary
judgment at the beginning of this case, didn't it?

11

MR. LATTA:

12

QUESTION:

3

No, not at all.

Yes, it did.
And one of the grounds for summary

judgment was qualified immunity.

4

MR. LATTA:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So it's not as if Idaho said, we will

6

never recognize any qualified immunity defense until the

7

day before trial.

8

The district court heard the claim and simply

9

decided against you, and all the other people are being

20

denied, the State people, is the right to appeal that

21

decision before trial.

22

MR. LATTA:

The district court decided the issue

23

in our favor, thinking that there had been a violation of

24

clearly established law, and at this juncture what the

25

petitioners want is to take their interlocutory appeal,

but they're not in a court system that's otherwise

2

available 200 miles to the south in Moscow to take that

3

appeal, and that's the -- the problem that they're faced

4

with is having made the decision, they're now objecting to

the effect of staying in the State system.

6

QUESTION:

I suppose your case would be harder

7

if Congress had written into 1983, made it a nice neat

8

package with a substantive right and a procedural right

9

all rolled into one, but the interlocutory appeal that

10

we're talking about comes not from the Bivens claim or the

11

1983 claim, it comes from the standard 1291, the

12

collateral order that applies as a matter of Federal

13

procedural law to all Federal courts on all questions.

14

MR. LATTA:

That is exactly --

Nothing unique to 1983 about 1291

QUESTION:

We don't think that they can do so

Well, you might even go so far, I

8

suppose, as saying there's no right to even have an

9

appellate structure at all in Idaho for a civilian civil

10

dispute like this.
MR. LATTA:

11

This Court earlier in the MLB

decision acknowledged that there was no right, there's no

requirement that the State provide civil appeals, and so

the answer to your question is that is correct.

If Congress were to amend 1291 and make it a

exceptions which this Court can carve out to the final

In other words, suppose the Federal statute were

wouldn't it prevail over the State statute as well, if it
were that strong a Federal policy?

MR. LATTA:

case for us to argue here.

The way the Idaho supreme court has ruled,

there's nothing that could have been done to get you there

In Federal court,

this Court has never said you
