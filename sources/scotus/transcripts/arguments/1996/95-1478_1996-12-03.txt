ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN P. HALBROOK

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. HALBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Federal-State context, this Court has

16

upheld laws passed under the spending power, the commerce

17

power, including the power to preempt State legislation,

18

and the Article VI duty of State judges to hear Federal

19

causes of action.

20

at issue here is not an exercise of any of those powers.

21

The interim provisions of the Brady act

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held

22

that, in essence, Congress may commandeer the sheriffs

23

departments of our country as long as the laws concerned

24

do not interfere unduly with their duties.

25

alternative for the States is to enact laws which meet

Honor.
QUESTION:

Mm-hmm, and will the case likely

become moot as to Sheriff Mack on that date?
MR. HALBROOK:

Well, I note that the successor

in office has been identified to the Clerk, and I believe

20

that this matter will be addressed further in the future,

21

but I don't think it will be moot.

such, would continue doing the same kinds of duties that

QUESTION:

Well, but he wouldn't be a CEO then,

would he --

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

-- or whatever you call the -- he

wouldn't be covered by the statute.

QUESTION:

A chief law enforcement officer.

10

QUESTION:

CLO.

11

MR. HALBROOK:

He would continue to be a chief

12

law enforcement officer as defined by the statute here,

13

and therefore he would be in a position of conducting the

14

checks.

15

QUESTION:

And would you mind telling us where

16

in the record we can find the evidence about the extent of

17

the burden on the sheriffs departments in enforcing this

law?

Clerk later, the references, please.

9

MR. HALBROOK:
QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

Would you like to summarize for us

11

what it showed in your view as to the extent of the

12

burden?

13

MR. HALBROOK:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

How many applications are filed in

15

theses two counties, and how much time of the deputies is

16

required to deal with it.

17

MR. HALBROOK:

18

In regard to the Printz case, we have

Yes, Your Honor.

19

approximately a dozen officers.

20

the checks were estimated to take between 1 hour per day

21

and several days, in the case of a very thorough check.

22

In the case of Mack, we have testimony that the checks

23

routinely took 1 to 2 hours per day.

24
25

We have a situation where

These are departments where between one-and-ahalf and two officers are on patrol at any given time.

These are
QUESTION:

2

3

Well, it would be rather strange to

have one-and-a-half on patrol, wouldn't it?

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HALBROOK:

That's just an average Your

6

Honor.

7

10 deputies, total, employed and when you count time off

8

and 8-hour days and what-not, you end up with an average

9

of one-and-a-half and, in the case of Ravalli County,

10
11

In the case of Graham County I believe there were

Montana, we have about two on patrol at any given time.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that that's

12

determinative here, how extensive the incursion upon the

13

officer's duties are?

14

MR. HALBROOK:

15

QUESTION:

No, Justice Scalia.

I mean, would the statute be

16

constitutional as to those officers who didn't take a

17

large proportion of their time --

18

MR. HALBROOK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HALBROOK:

Not at all.

-- and unconstitutional as to others?
Not at all.

These are just the

21

facts of the case.

23

would be unconstitutional.

I think that these departments could

We've not heard cited yet a specific provision
of the Constitution that justifies these commands.

We've

1

seen a lot of dancing around the Commerce Clause and

2

Article VI of the Constitution and my answer is no, that

3

regardless of the burden or lack thereof, that these

4

commands are not constitutional.

5

QUESTION:

Well, has Congress imposed a burden

6

on these chief law enforcement officers to report, or some

7

State official to report on traffic fatalities, for

8

example?

9

MR. HALBROOK:

Your Honor, that comes under the

10

spending power.

11

funds that provides that to get the highway funds there

filed a brief citing any number of cases, instances

20

through the years where Congress has required States or

21

local officials to perform some duties, and you assert

22

that in every case it was linked somehow to funding?

MR. HALBROOK:

As far as we could determine, the

24

statutes we looked at that were prominently cited by the

Government -- the one that you mentioned, the fatalities

relates to the National Crime Information Center, which is

a voluntary system of record reporting between the Federal

QUESTION:

How about some of the early cases

12

that seem to involve immigration and reguired court clerks

13

to keep some sort of a record or take some sort of an

14

affidavit, a State court.

15

MR. HALBROOK:

In our view that clearly comes

16

under Article VI, the special duty of State judges to hear

17

Federal causes of action and to do other things that

18

Congress passes that relate to the Article VI provision

19

and Congress, under Article I, section 8, is empowered to

20

enact a uniform rule of naturalization, and we interpret

21

those early naturalization statutes as being under that

22

provision and then being applied through the State

23

judiciary through Article VI.

24

uniform rule of naturalization that Congress could compel

you?

3

MR. HALBROOK:

Absolutely

not, because the

4

sheriff is not a State judge, and Article VI refers

5

explicitly to State judges.
QUESTION:

Yes, so -- but I don't think a whole

7

lot turns, then, on the power of Congress to pass uniform

8

rules of naturalization.

9

appropriate sphere, just as it acts within its appropriate

Congress is acting within its

10

sphere under the Commerce Clause.

11

MR. HALBROOK:

And the State judges have to

12

apply that through Article VI, so I think the clearest

13

example of the early Congress that applies here was the

14

same day that Congress passed the Tenth Amendment they

15

passed a resolution that the States would be encouraged to

16

enact legislation authorizing State local officials,

17

rather, to keep Federal prisoners in their jails.

seen as a completely voluntary function for which the

19

sheriffs would be paid.
QUESTION:

Mr. Halbrook, the Government in its

21

brief on page 31 has a footnote 21 citing several laws.

Do all of those, as far as you know, fit within the kind

1

some of them are very obscure laws.

2

there's ever been any litigation on them, so I cannot say

3

that there is a specific power in the case of every one of

4

these laws that one could link, for example, to the

5

spending power.

6

QUESTION:

I don't know that

Well, my question is, are you saying

7

that there's nothing like this, that in every case there's

8

either something explicit in the Constitution, like the
obligation of State courts that you get from Article VI,

10

or extradition?

11

anything that you would concede is like it?

12

Is this the first of a kind, or is there

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, I think there may be some

13

of these laws -- for example, I believe there's one cited

14

he're about underground storage facilities, where the

15

States are supposed to inventory and report underground

16

storage facilities and frankly, Your Honor, I was not able

17

to find a specific item in that statute that related to

18

the spending power.

that I'm not really sure what the basis of it is.

It's just one of those obscure laws

QUESTION:

May --

MR. HALBROOK:

But in terms of precedents for

just about your theory of the case?
Is it your position that, without having any

2

3

spending power at all, but just acting under the Commerce

4

Clause, Congress would not have the power to have States

5

report to it the number of fatalities involving children

caused by airbags for -- in 30-day period, or something

7

like that?

MR. HALBROOK:

8

9

It would not have the power to do that?
Justice Stevens, we find no power

in the Constitution just to do that.
QUESTION:

10

Well, the power -- I suppose the

11

argument would be the power is to regulate commerce, and

12

they're trying to improve safety on the highways and all

13

the rest of it by getting this data, but you'd say that

14

the Commerce Clause doesn't authorize that.

15

MR. HALBROOK:

It would authorize commerce to be

now.

MR. HALBROOK:

1

That is the basis for

this law.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Halbrook, the obligation,

as I

4

understand it, on the part of the law enforcement officers

5

is to use reasonable efforts.

6

MR. HALBROOK:

7

QUESTION:

Is that it?

That's correct.

Do whatever's reasonable.

Is there

8

in the statute any mechanism for review by anybody as to

9

whether a given law enforcement officer did use reasonable

10

efforts?
MR. HALBROOK:

11

No, Your Honor.

It's a very

12

vague term, and basically the law says that the CLEO, or

13

the chief law enforcement officer, shall use reasonable

14

efforts to ascertain whether receipt or possession of a

15

handgun is lawful, but then it goes on to say,

16

and we interpret this as a minimum that has to be carried

17

out,

18

record-keeping systems are available and in the national

19

system designated by the Attorney General.

including,

including research into whatever State and local

QUESTION:

20

Do you think it would be open to a

21

court,

to this Court to construe that reasonable effort

22

criterion as one which turns on the law enforcement

23

officer's own view of what in relation to all of his other

24

responsibilities, and in relation to his resources,

25

reasonable?

Can he be the judge of reasonableness?

To some extent, perhaps, because

the language is there, but I think that there's a

5

background checks and to make these legal determinations,

6

it seems that he is not making a reasonable effort.

QUESTION:

If he doesn't do

Well, unless he is the judge of

reasonableness.

9

reasonableness, so that there was, in effect, no review of

10
11
12

13

If he were the sole judge of

the adequacy of his efforts, would you have a case?
MR. HALBROOK:

I don't think he is the sole

judge, because -QUESTION:

No, but I'm asking you to assume my

14

hypothesis.

15

in such a way as to make him the sole judge, would you

16

have a case?

17

If he were -- if the statute were construed

MR. HALBROOK:

We would have no case if it was

18

totally optional, and I think your hypothetical would be

19

equivalent to changing shall to may.

20

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't optional.

I mean,

21

if I'm -- if I am compelled to make an honest judgment

22

about whether I have the resources to do this, presumably

23

I'm not going to, you know, perjure myself, and I will

24

therefore as a practical matter be compelled to use

25

resources if they are available.

MR. HALBROOK:

QUESTION:

MR. HALBROOK:

Well

Wouldn't I?
As I -- I agree with you, and as

4

I understood the question --

5

QUESTION:

So therefore your answer should be,

6

we would continue to have a case because it would, indeed,

7

continue to compel the State officers to do something.
MR. HALBROOK:

8

9

As I understood the question,

there will be no duty at all, and if there is any --

10

QUESTION:

No, that wasn't the question.

11

QUESTION:

No, the question was -- no, I'm

12

13

sorry.
The question was, there was no review, that the

14

final decision as to what was reasonable would be the

15

decision of the law enforcement officer and there would be

16

no review of that decision.

MR. HALBROOK:

On that hypothesis, would you have --

That's the hypothesis.

Okay.
Which is the perception of the

sheriff as not being a law-abiding sheriff.

should be enforced if it's on the books, and the sheriff

2

in all cases decides that he doesn't have to do anything

3

and he completely rejects any execution of the law or

4

consideration of execution of the law, then he does have

5

the political damage, and this is a particular

6

QUESTION:

Well, he would have -- and I think

7

your point is well-taken, but would

8

place him in the position that the opinion in the New York

9

case, for example, described as being essentially an agent

that -- would that

10

or employee, as it were, of the national Government to

11

carry out a national Government policy?

12

in a political spot,

I think you're right. But would that

13

rise to the level of

the obligation that in the broader

14

passages in the New York case was condemned as

15

unconstitutional?

16

MR. HALBROOK:

It might put him

Well, I think it would still come

17

under the prohibition on requiring a State to administer a

18

Federal regulatory program in the sense that there's got

19

to be some kind of minimal requirement.

20

QUESTION:

Well, of course, in this situation

21

are there not criminal penalties for someone who doesn't

QUESTION:

Right.

7

MR. HALBROOK:

And the -- one district court

8

held that that meant exactly what it said in the Mack

case, that that was a threat of criminal prosecution when

10

the law was first enacted and, in fact, the Bureau of

11

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spokesman on this law said

12

that there were criminal penalties that applied to law

13

enforcement officers.

14

However, none of the appellate courts have held

15

that the criminal penalties apply.

16

basically that that issue is moot because the Justice

Department interpreted the law not to apply -- interpreted

criminal penalties not to apply to CLEO's.

What I have to say, because I

represent real clients here, is that if the Government

5

says they don't apply and -- the criminal penalties don't

It says dealers shall do certain

The word shall appears in both, and if you want to say

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, I have to say, frankly

20

we're in a dilemma, because we're faced with the language

of the statute, which is clear enough, and when we went

into this litigation we asked for preliminary injunctions

In other countries they

Because of the text of the

that -- just to tell you what I think I would hope to

discuss -- are first that, because this law does not

impermissibly require the States to govern but, rather,

14

essentially applies Federal law to local law enforcement

15

officers and to gun dealers, requiring them to exchange

16

vital information, and because Brady uses local law

17

enforcement as the source of this information for the very

18

good reason that these offices have, for now, the most

19

ready access to the relevant information, and finally,

20

because the interim Brady provisions are by definition so

reasonable in their approach that it is necessary to

resort to resurrecting a rigid rule like the repudiated

Well, I think Justice Scalia has

The notion that the Federal

totally to administer some federally enacted program, all

the details of which are spelled out, is the question.

9
10

GENERAL DELLINGER:

I think it is important to

note what Congress cannot do.
First of all, in answer to your question and

11
12

Justice Scalia's about the extent of the burden, there is

13

some limit, as this Court suggested in Garcia, to how much

14

of a purely financial burden Congress could put on the

15

States if Congress made all the policy choices itself.

16

That -- and answering those hypothetically is difficult,

17

because it would depend on the degree of the national

18

interest.

19

In 1917, Congress had every State government

20

devote its entire resources for a brief period of time to

21

registering people for the World War I draft.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

It

would depend upon that and all the other circumstances as

5

to how great a burden Congress could put.

6

But I want to be clear that we believe that,

7

under the vital principles of New York v. United States,

8

there are provisions that would be unconstitutional, that

9

are different from the provision here.

10

For example, even if it only cost the State $5

11

and their officials 5 minutes of their time, the

12

Constitution would be violated if Congress had decided to

13

off-load some of the political responsibility here by

14

requiring each city council and county commission to vote

15

in the provisions of the Brady act.

16

Even though that's fairly costless, requiring

17

them to act like puppets and to call the roll saying, all

18

those in favor raise your hand, and they're required to

19

raise their hand when they're not in favor, or have some

20

other draconian alternative, such as taking title to

21

handgun liability.

22

principles.

23

That would violate the sovereignty

Similarly, if Congress had said that the States

24

must, by the year 2010, reduce the number of handgun sales

in the State by 50 percent, it would be worse than simply

carrying out their functions.

I think the more serious question is the one

that I think that Mr. Halbrook dealt with as well as he

can, which is, what is the principle that tells Congress,

going forward that this was always the last matter to be

14

done.

15

The fact of the matter is, Justice O'Connor I

16

think asked an important question, don't many CLEO's like

17

this law, and they're happy to comply with it.

18

the answer is not just some, the answer is most, but I

19

mean -- in fact, they wanted this duty.

20

major law enforcement organizations wanted this duty

21

placed on local law enforcement for some of the reasons

22

Justice Kennedy suggested.

23

QUESTION:

I mean,

They want -- the

other people have obeyed this law, and here you are

2

complaining about it?

3

(Laughter.)

4

GENERAL DELLINGER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

My

5

point is that they wanted it for a very good reason, for

6

the reason suggested in part by a question from Justice

7

Kennedy, that the alternative of having these duties

8

imposed upon a substantial Federal bureaucracy when they

9

are more easily done in the 3,000 counties that have more

10

local familiarity -QUESTION:

11

Well, but I suppose the answer to

12

that is, as the Constitution recognizes, that each branch

13

of the Government, State and Federal, has to make a

14

certain cost-benefit choice, and if Congress wants to have

15

some huge program, I suppose it can pay the political cost

16

for it.

17

GENERAL DELLINGER:

In this case the -- given

18

the fact that you have, for example, 56 FBI field offices,

19

one for every 30 counties, it would be extraordinarily

20

inconvenient, as well as inefficient, and the relevant

21

records are where local law enforcement is.
Congress didn't do this simply to off-load its

22

23

burdens.

fugitives from justice that are not on the NCIC, where you

25

could look up the local search warrants.

That's where the arrest warrants are for

Justice O'Connor naturally leads to the question

1

2

why not make it voluntary if most CLEO's want it?

3

there's something much more serious than a free ride or

5

than its weakest link, and I think the reason that local

6

law enforcement offices wanted Congress to make this

7

mandatory was that they understood that if you have one

8

county in a region or a State that simply announces we are

not going to look up and find out whether gun buyers are

I thought it was for just the opposite

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Federalism is being used

16

here, Justice Kennedy, to mitigate in this case the

17

effects of the enormous interstate mobility in handguns by

18

ensuring that there is some effort made to see which

19

illegal buyers are doing so before guns are sold.

surprising how often the Federal Government tells the

State -- or how rarely it tells a State you must do

something.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

6

Justice Kennedy, yes.

As opposed to the fact that you

shouldn't do something under the Supremacy --

7

GENERAL DELLINGER:

I agree with that

8

observation and I think that in a sense it cuts both ways

9

here.

It shows,

I think, that Congress has not abused the

10

fact that when it's acting under its legislative power it

11

may call upon -- impose, require some duties on local

12

offices.

13

founders would be surprised.

So if it is necessary and proper in

It has not abused that, even though I think the

or whatever, what's the distinction?
What is it that makes it okay to impose a duty

3

upon a State court to hear Federal cases, upon a Governor

4

to extradite officials, upon policemen to report missing

5

children, but doesn't impose a duty upon those same

6

officials that's really much more burdensome than that.

7

What's the principle?

8

GENERAL DELLINGER:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

How do you interpret the Necessary

10

and Proper Clause to get there, in light of the Tenth

11

Amendment interests, et cetera?
GENERAL DELLINGER:

12

I take your question to be,

13

where you have a law such as this that does not implicate

14

the concerns of sovereignty and accountability, what

15

happens if the number of those duties expands so greatly

16

that it begins to inhibit the ability of the States to

17

carry out their functions, unlike this law, which builds

18

in the flexibility to carry out State functions.

19

I think that is a question that, of course, you

20

need not decide here.

Kennedy's observation about how rarely Congress has used

this, you will probably never' have to decide --

it's the war power or some other very serious national

it is due in significant measure to commerce among the

States and the extraordinary mobility of handguns that

guns made anywhere are now available everywhere that roads

7

the harm of that cheap national availability that Congress

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Justice Kennedy, I think it

is significant that it's not merely their availability,

15

but the fact that they were uniquely well-situated.

16

The frustration is that a gun dealer who is

17

forbidden to sell a gun to a convicted felon but doesn't

know who they are -- he gets a form that they check off

Thank you for allowing me to

That is to say, if one CLEO could put up a sign saying, we

won't check for records, it will not, but it nonetheless

works as Congress intended, and therefore I think there's

no serious question of nonseverability here.
