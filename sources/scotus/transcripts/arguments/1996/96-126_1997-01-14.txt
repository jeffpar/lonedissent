CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALKER L. CHANDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHANDLER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1990 the State of Georgia adopted a law

11
12

requiring drug testing of all members of the State

13

government, State employees.

14

it adopted a law requiring drug testing as a condition of

15

employment or candidacy for candidates for public office.

16

Almost as an afterthought,

The first of those laws was struck down in the

17

lower courts.

18

Court by me and my co-plaintiff, who ran for office in

19

1994 .

This law was brought forward before this

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler --

21

MR. CHANDLER:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- you say that the petitioners ran

23

for office in '94, and in the petition you brought here

24

there's no assertion that any of the petitioners plan to

25

run again in the future, is there?

MR. CHANDLER:

Not in the - - as I recall, not in

the actual pleadings in the lower court.
QUESTION:

No.

However --

So how would we have

jurisdiction?
MR. CHANDLER:

Your Honor, I believe this case

6

would not be moot, because it would be capable of

7

repetition and yet evading --

8

QUESTION:

Well, how would it be if none of the

petitioners plan to run again?
10

MR. CHANDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CHANDLER:

Your Honor,

I plan to run again.

But that was not stated -That was not stated below.

Also,

13

Justice O'Connor, I -- my candidacy and the candidacy of

14

all Libertarian Party members is premised on the concepts

15

of limited government and freedom from unconstitutional

16

searches and seizures among all the other liberties

17

reserved to the people by the Founding Fathers, and in

18

that respect I would think that OCGA 21-2-140 is violative

1

of the interests of all candidates, whether or not --

20

QUESTION:

Well, that's a merits argument,

21

certainly, but normally we would look to see if there's

22

some situation in a case like this of being capable of

23

repetition and avoiding any review, and normally we would

24

look to see some avowal that yes, indeed, these

25

petitioners or at least one of them intends to run again.

MR. CHANDLER:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes, I understand that.

And you didn't seek to bring this on

behalf of a class of candidates.

4

MR. CHANDLER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CHANDLER:

7

QUESTION:

No, sir, Your Honor, I did not.

Mr. Chandler -Yes.

-- I'm wondering why, if you want to

8

raise this issue, you don't have to refuse to take the

9

drug test, rather than go ahead and take it and get on the

10
11

ballot and then challenge it later.
MR. CHANDLER:

Your Honor, we filed this action

12

prior to submitting to the test, prior to qualification by

13

having this little piece of paper that certified us as

14

being drug-free.

15

We were the nominees of our party.

We had an

16

obligation to take forward the message of our party, the

17

other messages of our party in the electoral process, so

18

we essentially had no choice but to submit -- unwillingly,

19

perhaps, but to submit to this State-ordered search.

20

25

QUESTION:

When did you file the suit, before

the election or after the election?
MR. CHANDLER:

Before the election, Your Honor,

in May of -QUESTION:

So at that time there's no doubt that

the case was not moot.

MR. CHANDLER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CHANDLER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

At that time it was very much alive.
Yes, Your Honor.

So the complaint is that you -- what,

5

that you didn't amend your complaint in order to assert

6

repetition after the election?

7

that, amending a complaint in a suit that originally was

8

not moot in order to aver that mootness has not occurred?
MR. CHANDLER:

9
10
11

Have we ever required

I don't know, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

I don't recall we've ever required

QUESTION:

Anyway, as an officer of the court,

that.

12

13

you represent to us that you intend to run again, that

14

this issue will arise again if the Georgia law stands?

15

MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, sir.

16

We search in vain the cases that this Court has

17

handed down which deal with suspicionless searches to find

18

where any blanket search of this nature, this magnitude,

19

and lacking any showing of any compelling State interest,

20

has been granted by this Court.
QUESTION:

21

Suppose that a State agency said, in

22

the interests of all of our employees, everyone once a

23

year must take a physical exam.

examination.

Is that a search?

2

MR. CHANDLER:

3

that would be a search.

4
5

QUESTION:

When does a search arise, when you go

into the doctor's office?

6

MR. CHANDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor, I would think

I would think so, Your Honor.

Even though the results are disclosed

only to you?
MR. CHANDLER:

I would think that it would be a

10

search, because if the result of that search is that you

11

can no longer serve in that agency, then --

12

QUESTION:

No, no.

No, the agency says, we

13

don't care what the medical exam discloses.

14

the interests of our employees we want you to be examined

15

once a year.

16

MR. CHANDLER:

We just, in

Well, I would think, Your Honor,

17

that's -- with all due respect, that's not before the

18

Court, and -- but the --

19

QUESTION:

Well, there are a lot of things that

20

are not before the Court that are going to be before the

21

Court based on this opinion, and so we have to write an

22

opinion that covers more than your particular case because

23

we're interested in the general principle.

24

MR. CHANDLER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I --

So I'm asking why this is a search.

MR. CHANDLER:

1

I would think that it would be a

2

search if, as a result of that search, a person could lose

3

employment.

4

QUESTION:

That's not my hypothetical.

All you

5

have to do is go to the doctor and just certify that

6

you've had a physical exam once a year at a doctor of your

7

choice.

8

interests of our employees, and that may well --we can

9

play with the hypothetical.

The agency says we want to do this in the

10

MR. CHANDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, sir.

The agency pays for it, or whatever.

Why is that a search?
MR. CHANDLER:

3

I would think it would be a

4

search under the principles of -- that were announced in

5

Schermberger, which drew a distinction between bodily

6

searches --

QUESTION:

8

MR. CHANDLER:

9

QUESTION:

That is to say, Schmerber?
Yes, sir.

Well, there the -- involuntarily a

20

needle was inserted in the -- with the patient by a doctor

21

who was not of his choice at a time that was not of his

22

choice.

custody.

He had --he was there, on the gurney, in
But that's quite different, it seems to me, from

It may well be, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

It may well be?

You think -- I

assume this physical exam requires a strip, right?

3

MR. CHANDLER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And you're saying that that's not a

5

search, requiring you to go to somebody else and strip

6

down and have that person examine your body?

7

MR. CHANDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

What possibly could be a search if

that's not a search?

10

MR. CHANDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

I think it's --

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, you might want to argue about

whether it's an unreasonable search, but you don't have

3

any doubt it's a search, do you?

4

MR. CHANDLER:

5

QUESTION:

No, sir, Your Honor.

Mr. Chandler, would you have any

6

problem if what the State did instead of requiring a drug

7

test within 30 days of filing your nominating petition is

8

require every candidate for the State office to file an

9

affidavit certifying that the candidate is not now and has

20
21

not in the past used or ingested illegal narcotic drugs?
MR. CHANDLER:

I would object to that, Your

22

Honor, because that would --

MR. CHANDLER:

QUESTION:

There's no search.
There is no search, but I --

It certainly wouldn't -- you wouldn't

be here on the basis that you are here today.

2

MR. CHANDLER:

3

QUESTION:

4

That would be true.

And a State has wide latitude, does

it not, to define qualifications for State office?
MR. CHANDLER:

5

Yes, so long as those -- so long

6

as they do not violate people's constitutional

7

protections.
QUESTION:

8

9

And what constitutional protection

would be violated by requiring such an affidavit, that to

10

be a candidate for State office you certify that you're

11

not a drug abuser?
MR. CHANDLER:

12

Or never have been in your

13

hypothetical, Your Honor.

14

and I would object not on a constitutional grounds --

15

17

QUESTION:

You asked if I would object,

I'm asking on what constitutional

basis.
MR. CHANDLER:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I fail to

18

know of a constitutional basis that that might fit within

19

that hypothetical.

20

QUESTION:

You just wouldn't like it.

21

MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that it

22

might have some implication for free -- free speech

23

implications under the First Amendment, Your Honor, but --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, if you had to take an oath that

you have never been disloyal to the Government of the

1

United States, of a State, or you've never been a member

2

of, say, the Socialist Party, then you might have an

3

objection under a different amendment than the one you're

4

claiming, but you are claiming the Fourth Amendment, and

5

you are doing it in relation to a bodily intrusion.

6

The Fourth Amendment puts on the same line as

7

the security of one's person the security of one's papers.

8

Would you then question the requirement that if you run

9

for office you must do a complete financial disclosure

10
11

which will involve disclosing papers?
MR. CHANDLER:

I think that there the Court has

12

drawn distinctions in the past between bodily searches and

13

financial disclosure.

14

financial disclosure.

15

QUESTION:

I did not object in this case to

But the Fourth Amendment does say

16

persons, houses, papers, so why would you say that it's

17

all right to demand papers but not have anything to do

18

with the person?

19

MR. CHANDLER:

Because I think there is a

20

strong, compelling privacy interest in the person that

21

goes far beyond the compelling -- any compelling

22

interest --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Where do you get that from in the

Constitution?
MR. CHANDLER:

Justice Ginsburg, I do not know.

1

QUESTION:

Well, isn't --

2

QUESTION:

And is it the personal interest in

3

not having to strip and have needles inserted, or is it

4

the personal interest in not disclosing the results,

5

because if it's the latter, then your case is perhaps more

6

difficult.

MR. CHANDLER:

QUESTION:

So you think most people would think

11

that that's more of an invasion of privacy, just going to

12

the doctor once a year, than having to disclose all of

3

your financial records, all of your holding, all of your

4

poverty or all of your wealth, as the case may be?

5

MR. CHANDLER:

There is a big distinction in

6

this case, Your Honor, and that is that if I disclose my

7

wealth I cannot be kept off the ballot.

8
9
20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, every invasion of

privacy is not a search, is it?

Are you willing to equate

every invasion of privacy with a search?
I mean, would you consider it a search if,

22

instead of having someone examine you physically to decide

23

whether you have cocaine in your body, you are required to

24

disclose whether you have cocaine in your body?

25

I mean, that may be an invasion of privacy, but

is it a search?
MR. CHANDLER:

2

3

Yes sir, I would deem it a

search.

4

QUESTION:

You think it's a search?

5

MR. CHANDLER:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So when I ask you, you know, are you

7

a drug addict, I'm searching you?

8

if we're going to talk like that.

Words have no meaning

9

QUESTION:

Why --

10

QUESTION:

You just told me it wasn't, so which

11

answer are you giving?

12

wouldn't be a Fourth Amendment search, but I'd object, and

13

now you tell Justice Scalia, yes, it's a search.

14

which answer do you want to abide by here.
MR. CHANDLER:

15

You answered to me that no, it

Now,

I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I'm

16

not exactly sure of the contradiction that I've voiced

17

here.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, going back to Justice

19

Ginsburg's question, assuming that you had actually to

20

disclose papers, produce papers as distinct simply from

21

producing information, so that there really were -- in the

22

same sense that we're talking with here, there really were

23

a search involved, I take it that your answer would -- I

24

take it that your answer to the question would not

25

necessarily be the same as your position here, because the

1

governmental interests involved are different.
You might or might not think the Government had

2

3

a sufficient interest in requiring that kind of production

4

from its political candidates, but at least the

5

Government's justification, what we would look to to

6

decide whether it was reasonable or not would, I take it,

7

in your view be different from the weight of the

8

government's justification in this case.

9

way to characterize your position?
MR. CHANDLER:

10
11

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that a fair

I think that

would be a fair way to characterize it.
QUESTION:

12

And your real argument before us, I

3

take it, doesn't go to the scope of what is or is not a

4

search, but the scope of what is permissible on the

5

grounds that the government does have a justification

6

which is sufficiently weighty to make that search a

7

reasonable one.

8
9

Is that it?

MR. CHANDLER:

Well, I certainly felt like it

was a -- that a financial search or a financial disclosure

20

was a more reasonable government requirement than a drug

21

test.
QUESTION:

22

All right, and what is your reason

23

for saying that this particular search is not a reasonable

24

one?

25

justification?

What's the nub of your attack on the government's

MR. CHANDLER:

1

First, there is no real evidence

of a real problem.

3

have been allowed by this Court have always been narrowly

4

limited to certain areas -- the front line in the war on

5

drugs, drug interdiction, the use of firearms, the train

6

accidents, things where a real problem or a real

7

potentiality has been shown, and not mere hypotheticals.
And so the essence of this case is that this is

There -- this -- the searches which

power over people for a very symbolic purpose, which is

11

put on the State of Georgia.

12

designed to keep drug abusers out of office.

12

MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, sir.

This -- a very similar case was

brought in the district court.

14

Thornburgh was also decided in the district court level in

1990, where the Justice Department wished to test, have

MR. CHANDLER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You're in a position to challenge the

4

requirement for lieutenant governor.

5

you're in a position to challenge requirements for other

6

offices which you didn't seek, and certainly, don't you

7

think there is an argument on behalf of the State that the

8

people have a right to have a lieutenant governor who is

9

free of drug use?

10

~

what, lieutenant governor?

MR. CHANDLER:

I don't know that

First, Your Honor, the --my co­

11

plaintiff, Sharon Harris, ran for commissioner of

12

agriculture.

13

drug abuse or drug use in high offices or any other

14

offices in Georgia has been any kind of a problem.

15

Secondly, there was never any showing that

Well, Georgia, then you feel can't

adopt a prophylactic rule that says we want to make sure

17

it doesn't become a problem?

18

MR. CHANDLER:

No, sir, I do not think they can.

19

I think that a potential problem, a hypothetical,

20

potential problem is not a real problem and is therefore a

21

symbolic problem.

QUESTION:

What if the Georgia statute, instead

23

of reading the way it does, had said everybody has to take

24

this drug test but anybody can get on the ballot.

Why --

I thought you were complaining about

MR. CHANDLER:

Yes.

The search would be exactly the same

in that situation, wouldn't it?

MR. CHANDLER:

14

Yes, Your Honor.

So how would it be any better?

I

should be, you know, no, it's just as bad.

MR. CHANDLER:

Well,

people of Georgia to decide whether or not you can be on

MR. CHANDLER:

I believe this Court has held, at

13

least since the Carroll case in 1925, that blanket

14

searches are intolerable, and that that would just be a

15

blanket search.

16

QUESTION:

And would that be the same if every

17

employee was required to get a physical examination once a

18

year?

19

MR. CHANDLER:

Yes, sir, I believe it would be.

20

It would be a blanket search required by government, and I

21

think a blanket search of people to determine whether or

QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, I guess the test under

the Fourth Amendment is whether the search is reasonable.
Now, does it enter into the balance of whether

8

it's reasonable at all if it were shown that the virtually

9

universal experience of private employers is to require an

10

annual physical of employees, or to require a periodic

11

drug testing?

12

^

MR. CHANDLER:

Does that affect the balance when we look at a

13

State-ordered search or not?

14

reasonable, the general practice in the private community?

15

MR. CHANDLER:

Does it affect what's

I do not think so, Justice

16

O'Connor, because there's a difference between the

17

contractual relationship between employee and an employer

18

and the political relationship between the government and

candidates, and people who wish to be a part of that

For one thing, that presupposes

MR. CHANDLER:

11

Your Honor, we would like always

for our elected officials to be people who obey the law.

13

However, when the Founding Fathers set forth the Fourth

14

Amendment's prohibitions against illegal searches, I think

15

they realized that people would be doing things that were

16

illegal, and the answer that they sought, the answer that

they would not allow would be blanket, suspicionless

QUESTION:

But Mr. Chandler, I think the issue

that's been raised is at least so far not an issue of

My way of answering that question

But my question to you is, then,

20

doesn't the Fourth Amendment always win on that balance

21

unless you have a good reason, a reason beyond, we want to

22

show that these people take tests.

23

One reason is that you would catch people, as

24

was the case in the train engineer, but here that's not

25

the purpose.

MS. GUILDAY:

I said that and I -- and that is a

4

quote from one of this Court's cases. However, obviously

5

the Constitution has to define everything.
QUESTION:

And the Constitution looks a little

more closely at totally suspicionless searches, doesn't

it?

MS. GUILDAY:

It does.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

I take it -- or I took it that part

12

of your argument for the State interest that sort of

13

overcomes the private interest here is based on the Tenth

14

Amendment, and I'm not sure that I understand that

15

argument.

16

I mean, I take it you do not argue that the

17

Tenth Amendment in effect gives the State some kind of

18

right or some dispensation from the Fourth Amendment, so

19

what is the Tenth Amendment argument?

20

MS. GUILDAY:

The Tenth Amendment argument is,

21

in this balancing test that's required in the Fourth

22

Amendment, that in the usual context the scales start out

23

even for both sides.

24

tips those scales from the outset on the side of the

QUESTION:

2

MS. GUILDAY:

Why?
Because the Tenth Amendment in the

cases this Court has held in the elections context say, we

are going to give great deference to the State's own

5

characterizations of its interest in the elections and in

6

particular in the qualifications of its elected officials.
QUESTION:

7

Well, there's no question of there

8

being an assertable Tenth Amendment interest there, but

9

there's no question about there being an assertable Tenth

10

Amendment interest to prosecute homicide, but that doesn't

11

affect the balancing that goes on in determining --or

that does not affect the Fourth Amendment analysis.

13

MS. GUILDAY:

14

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand --

Well, I suppose if someone challenged

the right of the State to prosecute murder we would say,
16

well, that certainly is not one of those powers that was

17

taken away from the State when the national Constitution

18

was ratified.

19

MS. GUILDAY:

20

QUESTION:

That's absolutely --

I don't see how that would affect the

Fourth Amendment analysis when somebody objected to an

evidence that the State wanted to introduce in a homicide

case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALKER L. CHANDLER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHANDLER:

13

An interesting aspect of the

14

Tenth Amendment question to me is that that the States --

15

that which was not granted to the Federal Government

16

specifically was -- the rights not granted to the Federal

17

Government was reserved to the States or the people

18

respectively, and when the States appear to jealously

19

protect their rights, they are not so jealous in

20

protecting the rights that the people reserved unto

21

themselves, and one of those rights is that a citizen

22

should be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

QUESTION:

Mr Chandler, do you think this case

24

would be stronger for the State if it was random drug­

25

testing?

MR. CHANDLER:

It would not comfort me, Your

Honor, and I'm not sure -QUESTION:

This is stronger, isn't it, because

it says -- basically what you said was that this is the

6

State's interest only in making certain that the really

7

serious drug users who can't stay off drugs for 30 days,

8

which you have to be quite a heavy user, that they want to

9

identify those people, so she said that's a very important

interest, identifying these very, very heavy drug users,

and against that it's a fairly limited intrusion.

this statute to make it random?

14
15
16

So what would your reply be to that?

MR. CHANDLER:

The State might be in a better

position if they had some sort of random search system for
people who had been elected to office.
However, I think even such a search would

17

violate the principles that have been enunciated by this

18

Court in Skinner, Von Raab, and the Vernonia School

19

District case, because there has to be some nexus between

20

the tests, and there has to be some compelling State

21

interest, and there has to be a showing of, not potential

22

harm, but an actual existing harm.

23

I don't know, for example, that they've ever

24

shown that commissioners of agriculture in Georgia have a

heavy drug problem, or for that matter lieutenant

MR. CHANDLER:

3

Georgia that no man's liberty or property is safe as long

4

as it's in session, and 21.2.140 is a perfect example of

5

that, where for the most cavalier of reasons, just pure

symbolism, they want to take away people's Fourth

take these tests so as to somehow show that they are --by

There's an old saying down in

QUESTION:

One point that you made in your brief

12

was that this is -- this test is not very serious because

13

it would catch at best the worst cases, but you certainly

14

wouldn't find more satisfactory a test that was less hard

15

to beat, a test more pervasive, so I didn't understand

16

your point about the lack of effect of this test.

MR. CHANDLER:

This test is even worse because

it involves cheap symbolism.

The other test would violate

I would like to just say finally that this all

There will be a possibility of hair testing to
show that people can -- have used something that the
government has declared illegal within the last 6 or 8
