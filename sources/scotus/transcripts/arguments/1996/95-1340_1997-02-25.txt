ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case brings before the Court three issues

11
12

under the False Claims Act that represents the Court's

13

first occasion to address some of the myriad issues which

14

have arisen under the 1986 amendments to that act, and

15

beyond, it is this Court's first qui tarn case since World

16

War II.

17

Two of the issues, the meaning of the public

18

disclosure provision of the 1986 amendments and the

19

meaning of the pivotal bedrock statutory term, false

20

claim, are of enduring and high practical significance to

21

the law.

22

The threshold issue in the case is

23

retroactivity, addressed, of course, in terms of first

24

principles by this Court in Landgraf.

25

pleases, I will speak to the retroactivity issue before

If the Court

1

turning to the other two questions, which are looming

2

large nationwide in Federal court litigation.
As to retroactivity, although issues of

3
4

retroactivity and, indeed, its very meaning are not

5

without difficulty, we believe that this case fits well

6

within the Landgraf analysis.

7

In particular, the public disclosure provision

8

of the

986 amendments did something very specific.

9

eliminated a defense, a very basic defense, namely the

10

defense of Government knowledge.

11

the conduct in question, Hughes' accounting practices

It

That is, at the time of

2

under a variety of Government contracts, the fact that the

3

Government had knowledge of the information or the

4

allegations would constitute a complete bar to Mr.

5

Schumer's lawsuit.

6

The

986 amendments wipe this out, thereby

7

expanding the circumstances under which a Government

8

contractor could face liability.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Starr --

20

QUESTION:

Do they wipe it out as to everyone,

21
22

or do they wipe it out as to suit by the Government?
MR. STARR:

Well, Government knowledge would

23

not, of course, be a bar with respect to the Government.

24

The Government can, in fact, bring a False Claims Act --

25

QUESTION:

So in fact he's liable.

Both then

1

and now he was liable for the same conduct, regardless of

2

the Government's knowledge.

3

the other side is that all the change does is to say in

4

the future we're going to let private people bring that

5

suit as well as the Government, right?

6

MR. STARR:

I think the argument made by

Your Honor, if I may, it seems to me

7

that under the Landgraf analysis, the fact that you are

8

permitting private parties theretofore barred to bring the

9

action is indeed an additional burden using the judgmental

10
11

process that this Court in Landgraf said is -QUESTION:

Mr. Starr, the conduct that can be

12

charged is the same, but in one case you have the

13

Government as a prosecutor.

14

prosecutor.

15

Now you have added a private

How does that differ from a U.S. Attorney's

16

Office that has no strike force at the time a crime is

17

committed and then beefs up with a -- just a tremendous

18

high-powered crew?

19

thin prosecutor's office when I did it, and therefore you

20

can't retroactively set the strike force after me?

21

MR. STARR:

Can the defendant say, well, it was a

Justice Ginsburg, we believe the key

22

distinction is the fact that there is an expansion in your

23

hypothetical of the public service, which is quite

24

decidedly different, in our view, than empowering private

25

individuals who do not take the oath of office and who do

1

not operate, as this Court has noted in case after case,

2

with the same sort of strictures that a public actor, a

3

public official acts under.
It's altogether different if you're in fact

4
5

facing the United States Government, including a beefed-

6

up United States Government, as opposed to a private

7

relator who is motivated by an entirely different set of

8

motivations.
This Court noticed -- noted that in its 1943

9
10

opinion, decision in Marcus v. Hess.

There may be issues

11

or motivations of greed, or an effort to seek vengeance

12

and retribution with respect to a particular qui tarn

13

action.

14

Those are inadmissible qualities of an orderly

15

public prosecution function, and there are any number of

16

safeguards in place to assure that the public prosecution

17

function that you identified is in fact carried out within

18

the context of a culture of regulations and procedures

19

and, indeed, those procedures are very important.

Justice Frankfurter who reminded us that the history of

21

liberty is in no small part the history of procedure.

22

QUESTION:

It was

Mr. Starr, are you then saying that

23

if the Government agency -- let's say there's an

24

antidiscrimination law that's put in the charge of a

25

Government agency, and then Congress decides to add on to

that a private right of action because the agency isn't

2

well-enough staffed.

3

private right, they cannot reach any conduct that occurred

4

before the private right was created?

5

MR. STARR:

The private actors who are given a

It seems to us that, while that is a

6

more difficult question in terms of the creation of that

7

sort of private right of action, yes.

8

under a Landgraf analysis that, in fact, is going to a

9

very material change in the exposure of the defendants in

10

an analytically distinct way.

11

QUESTION:

We believe that

Mr. Starr, you're not really saying

12

that they can't do that.

13

Congress wants to do that it has to make it clear.

14

Congress could say, this statute applies to acts committed

15

before the private right of action is created.

16

MR. STARR:

17

QUESTION:

So you're not speaking of the

MR. STARR:

Right.

We are speaking of

23

what is the default presumption, and we think, just in

24

terms of fairness considerations, this Court went to some

25

length in its Landgraf opinion to talk about fairness and

1

the burdens to the parties who are affected by this,

2

and - QUESTION:

3

Well, what fairness here seems to be,

4

in effect, an estimate of the odds of getting prosecuted,

5

or the odds of getting caught.

6

normally mean by fairness in this context.
MR. STARR:

7

That is not what we

It is -- I accept the point that the

8

odds of getting caught would not, I believe, harkening

9

back to Justice Ginsburg's hypotheticals, carry the day

10
11

12

for me.
Justice Souter, it is only if you accept what we
believe is an established proposition in this Court's

3

jurisprudence that an action by the sovereign is

4

qualitatively different than an action by a private actor

5

who is animated by a different set of considerations.

6

The Court has said it, and we believe that is

7

indeed an additional burden that should call upon

8

Congress, as Justice Scalia is suggesting.

9

talking about here is, what should be the default

20
21

What we are

presumption?
There's no indication that Congress believed

22

that it was enabling a new category of candidates to in

23

fact look retrospectively, and especially in this context,

24

where what was changed in the law -- what was changed in

25

the law was the fact that in the ongoing relationship

1

between the Government contractor and the Government, if,

2

in fact, in this relationship of information flow, if the

3

Government contractor is flowing information to the

4

Government in that relationship, that contractual

5

relationship, no stranger to the relationship under the

6

regime that existed since World War II could then come

7

into Federal court and assail a particular practice.

8

That seems to us to be a fairness consideration.

9

QUESTION:

0

Well, it's not only fairness.

I

suppose it's depriving you of a defense you earlier had.

11

What's your best case for the fact that if you're denied a

12

defense, that this is a substantive expansion of the

3

liability?

4

MR. STARR:

This Court has said with respect to

5

statutes of limitation in particular that the elimination

6

of that kind of defense does, in fact, work a change, and

7

should not, in fact, be retroactively applied.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. STARR:

20
21

What's your best case for that?
I can get you that on rebuttal, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But that's a defense against

22

everybody, isn't it, Mr. Starr, and this is not a defense

23

against everybody, and it's a defense that doesn't have

24

any relationship to the primary conduct.

25

MR. STARR:

It does have a relationship, Justice

Souter, I believe, if I may beg to differ, with respect to

2

what this bar is all about.

3

If one carefully reads 3730(a)(4)(A), it is

4

about the disclosure of information.

5

the information?

Who originally had

The information, by definition, is in the hands

of the Government contractor.

8

under a regime that existed for 40 years, 43 years, knew

that all it needed to do was to keep the Government

10

informed, and that insulated it from qui tarn relator

11

exposure.

is our submission.

13

the underlying conduct of what the contractor is doing and

14

the incentives --

15

That, to us -- if one doesn't accept that, that

QUESTION:

We think that is in fact looking to

Yes, but of course, your answer

16

assumes that in any event, even under the old regime, the

17

Government could have sued for precisely what this

18

particular relator is suing on.

19

MR. STARR:

That is correct.

There is no

20

question that the underlying issue could, in theory.

21

think it does bear noting that -- and this moves me, if I

22

may, to some of the other issues in the case, that -- and

23

what was Congress' policy that was being implicated here?

I

Congress' policy concern was that there were not
enough levels of activity with respect to ferreting out

What this case represents, a sort of -- the

2

3

extreme of the most elaborate and careful exacting

4

governmental scrutiny, and that in the context of highly

5

sophisticated and sensitive Government contracts where

6

there is. Justice Souter, a flowing of information

7

continually, including with governmental auditors resident

8

on premises.

9

That is a very different kind of regime that I

10

think the concerns that were animating Congress, which was

what?

12

public disclosure issue and the meaning of false claim.

13

With respect --

14

We want to -- and this moves me, if I may, to the

QUESTION:

Before you leave that, could -- if --

suppose we were to disregard the label, jurisdictional or

not, and look at it under --

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

I missed the first part of your -Suppose that in looking to see

19

whether it's retroactive or not you don't necessarily look

20

just to the label, which is what you want.

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.
Suppose we were to look at whether

23

there was fair notice, reasonable reliance, and the

It makes a material difference as

And what I want you to do is to

explain how.
MR. STARR:

It makes a material difference in

14

terms of the incentives to keep the Government apprised.

15

Under the prior regime, one has an enormous amount of

16

incentives, and obviously I'm speaking in the abstract,

17

because responsible Government contractors keep the

18

Government informed, and what is at issue here was an

19

extraordinarily hypertechnical dispute as to disclosure,

20

disclosure that was ultimately found, of course, not to

21

not only cost the Government any money, but the underlying

22

accounting practice actually saved the Government money.

23

QUESTION:

Well, you don't argue now and you

24

don't argue in your brief that it gives them the incentive

25

to disclose to some public group that there is a problem,

QUESTION:

-- there are 50 more lawyers.

2

MR. STARR:

No, that the incentives again are,

3

with respect to the underlying conduct, keep the

4

Government fully informed.

5

There was an additional set of incentives under

6

the Government knowledge bar, because as soon as you made

7

the Government aware -- there is a dispute as to whether

8

the Government was aware or not with respect to what we

9

were doing, but under the prior bar, as soon as you made

10

the Government aware of it you were free and clear.

11

was air-tight.

12

It

That strikes us as a material difference.

With respect, if I may, with the Court's

3

permission, move to public disclosure.

4

here in a very important ruling in this respect held that

5

the disclosure of allegations concerning these accounting

6

practices to employees, undisputed, of both Northrop and

7

of Hughes did not trigger the public disclosure bar.

8
9

The Ninth Circuit

Now, why did the Ninth Circuit conclude that?
It concluded that those employees operate within what the

20

court called a closed loop of secrecy.

21

all respect to the Ninth Circuit, is not moored to the

22

statute at all.

This holding, with

one of the enumerated categories of disclosure, and in an

3

investigation, another enumerated category.

4

Those categories we think are illuminating,

5

because in contrast to other categories such as the news

media, or a congressional hearing, or a congressional

7

anyone other than the wrongdoer is asked questions, other

under your interpretation it virtually wipes out an audit

MR. STARR:

The apparent harshness of the regime

that I am espousing and that you're discerning, Justice

15

O'Connor, is upon reflection true to Congress' intent.

16

one examines the background of these amendments, one sees

17

that what really had Congress concerned -- the National

18

Association of Attorneys General was up in arms on this.

19

This is undisputed -- was State of Wisconsin v. Dean,

20

which embodied the value of the original whistleblower.
That's the true qui tarn relator, Justice

I agree with that as well, because

6

there is, in fact -- but I don't think that that should

change the Court's disposition, but the Second Circuit's

approach is correct and the Ninth Circuit's approach is

wrong, because, in fact, of the concern that in this

There were two forms, Justice Stevens.

Whereas, if it had simply said disclosure, but not public

We believe that's the most natural meaning.

But an administrative investigation

7

doesn't necessarily mean disclosure outside the

MR. STARR:

No, it does not, but there has to be

the provision, there must be a disclosure, then apply

2

allegations or transactions in this -- so under my

interpretation of your redrafted statute, Justice Scalia,

it might very well be that under this disclosure would

Fine.

Then why isn't it a perfectly

minimal definition of public to say that disclosure to the

19

he's being disclosed in his capacity as member of the

Yes, but if you're interested in,

your requirements, why wouldn't that do it?

4

MR. STARR:

Because I think that will strike a

very different balance than what Congress struck, Justice

6

Breyer, because what you will be doing is, in fact,

encouraging, quote, whistleblowing actions by individuals

8

who have no information to provide to the Government.

that when the other side stands up the other side will

The underlying problem, Your Honor,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOLD:

3

Two things, if I could, Justice

4

O'Connor.

First of all, when the case was brought, the

5

audit reports within the Government had not reached the

6

conclusion that the Government had saved money --

7

QUESTION:

Right.

8

MR. GOLD:

-- but rather that the Government had

9

lost money.
Secondly, if in the end the only claim left here

10
11

is the claim based on the improper cost accounting

12

disclosure statement, we presume that all that would be at

13

issue in terms of the liability would be the penalty

14

provision for filing a false claim.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

And what is that penalty if no money

MR. GOLD:

Well, it is still -- at the time it

is lost --

18

was $2,000 -- a false claim, and I think the point of

19

this, Justice O'Connor, is shown first of all by the

20

particular provision we have here in the background, or as

21

we emphasize in our brief, a case like the Rohleder case

22

in the Third Circuit, where the contractors certified that

23

subcontracts had been let as was required by the

24

Government regulations through competitive bidding, when

25

in fact they hadn't.

1

Mr. Gold, I expect the $2,000 is

2

peanuts compared to what else you're entitled to, and that

3

is the costs of the action, the costs of the civil action.

4

I expect that by the time the discovery that the

5

Government hadn't lost any money was made, the plaintiff

6

here had invested well in excess of $2,000.

your costs, don't you, as well?

You would think that once it was found the

not worth expending a lot more money prosecuting this suit

21

for $2,000, but you're going to get the $2,000 plus all

22

that you've spent up to now prosecuting it.

go back to the law issues here, the two issues left in

2

this case.

3

The other one on which there are no audit

4

findings, and on which if you compare the original

5

Northrop request for an audit with the final audit reports

6

there's nothing but confusion, is whether Hughes misled

7

Northrop in terms of what costs would be charged to the

8

radar development for the B-2, and whether that generated

9

false claims.

10

Now, there is nothing in -- there is nothing but

11

discord at this point, and that's why the Ninth Circuit

12

sent that issue back, and therefore there may be real

13

money here.

14

That's just not clear yet.

There are two claims, one of which rests on the

15

issue that the -- that Hughes has brought up here, the

16

disclosure statement issue, and on that our position is

17

that if the Government requires as a condition of

18

contracting that you provide certain accurate information

19

in order to safeguard the contracting system and to assure

20

that the charges are proper charges, and if you knowingly

21

provide false and incomplete and misleading statements and

22

certifications, then there is a false claim, and that is

23

true whether or not the claim is overstated.

24
25

So we think the answer to the sole question that
the -- that Hughes raises in this regard is no.

In that

situation the False Claims Act does apply, and it

2

generates at least the penalty which assures the integrity

3

of the contracting system and provides the Government that

kind of benefit, and that's true whether it's, you have to

show us what your cost accounting system is, or you have

to let subcontracts by competitive bidding, or you have to

statute for a relator to bring an action if the Government

13

couldn't bring an action.

14

MR. GOLD:

There's no -- if the Government

15

brings the first case, there can be no relator.

16

relator brings a case there cannot be a second or third

17

relator, and if a relator brings a case, the Government

18

can always take it over.

19

QUESTION:

If one

But they're saying, I think, which is

20

bothering me too, that it just isn't fair.

21

that's, I think, relevant, because after all a statute of

22

limitations -- suppose Congress passed a statute of

23

limitations and tried to revive some action that expired

24

in 1810?

would be so upsetting of reliance interests that we

wouldn't permit it, and -- I don't think -- and so they're

3

saying here, you see, it's unfair.

4

against the private, and we had a course of action telling

5

the Government everything, working it all out with the

6

Government.

7

We're home free.

We had this defense

And now we don't.

So is it -- I mean, is there a way that you can

8

address this question that they say they reasonably relied

9

on the old statutes, it's unfair to upset that reasonable

10
11

reliance.
MR. GOLD:

The proposition that you can after

12

the fact, which is what we're dealing with here, tell the

13

Government something and save yourself from liability is

14

simply an erroneous statement.

15

QUESTION:

The Government --

Well, but now you're ignoring, I

16

think, the point, which is if you fail as a Government

17

contractor to disclose something on the form that the

18

Government said you should have put it on, and the

19

contractor later realizes, oh, that should have been on

20

that form 8929, and it wasn't, I'm going to tell the

21

Government, I really goofed, I made the mistake, the

22

Government can still sue, but you've told 'em.

23

But, under the new law, no qui tarn action could

24

have been brought by a third party for that because the

25

contractor had told the Government.

Yes, the Government

could file a suit, but a disgruntled employee could not.

2

MR. GOLD:

Well --

3

QUESTION:

So to that extent there is a

4

retroactive change, is there not?

5

MR. GOLD:

There is a retroactive change in

6

terms of the -- the openness of the courts to the private

7

party.

8

If that kind of change, which seems to me also

9

to be true of taking the jurisdictional amount out of the

10

Federal question jurisdiction which was done, or a change

11

which otherwise creates the ability after the fact of

12

somebody else to sue where before only the United States

13

could sue --

14

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't that what this

15

petitioner is coming before us and alleging, that until

16

the 1986 amendments we had assumed that while the

17

Government could still complain, that no qui tarn action

18

could be brought by this particular relator, and they say

19

that was this situation.

20

MR. GOLD:

Now, could it possibly be?

Well, two things, if I could, because

21

I'm down to my last 5 minutes.

One is that there is no

22

showing that Government contractors after the fact made

23

these representations to the Government in order to cut

24

off qui tarn relators, and there's no showing that Hughes

25

made any such showing.

1

All of this came out in the fullness of time,

2

and no showing that the Government didn't act after the

3

fact, if you came in and you said we knowingly gave you

4

false statements, or we knowingly misled a contractor, and

5

I don't think those kinds of expectations have ever been

6

seen to be the kind that are protected by this rule of

7

fairness on public disclosure.
The -- it seems to us the critical points are

8

9

that at no juncture in the evolution of the '86

0

jurisdictional bar provision were all Government

11

disclosures a basis for prohibiting the going forward of a

12

qui tarn suit.

3

At every stage, the forms of disclosure

which led to the bar were limited.
There was a set of negotiations which are not

4
5

public, and in this instance as opposed to Landgraf after

6

the discussions statutory language came out and nobody

7

tried to explain it.

8
9

Everyone seems to have kept their word that the
statute would be the statute, and at that point the forms,

20

or the means by which disclosure could be made, were

21

expanded.

22

But at the very same time, the word public was

23

added before the word disclosure for the first time, and

24

it's just impossible, if you read the statute for what it

25

tells you, to say that a disclosure within a contractual

relationship marked confidential, for business purposes

2

only, in the only way that a disclosure can be made to a

3

fictitious entity which is the other contracting party,

4

namely to its responsible officials, is a public

5

disclosure.
QUESTION:

6

But do you agree with the Solicitor

7

General's definition, because as I read the briefs, you

8

and the Solicitor General have a different approach.

9

MR. GOLD:

Well, in the peculiarities of this

10

case, our approach and the Government's come down to the

11

same thing.
We say a disclosure within the contractual

12

13

relationship as such is not a public disclosure.

14

Government says a disclosure to the allegedly wrongdoing

15

party is not a public disclosure and here, because the

16

allegedly wrongdoing party is a corporation, the

17

disclosure to its responsible officers is the only way you

18

can make such a disclosure.

19

The

I would point out that the Government's position

20

at least averts the problem that's inherent in the tiny

21

bit of concession that the petitioner makes, namely that

22

the petitioners would have you have a jurisdictional

23

inquiry into who in the corporation was involved in the

24

wrong, where the Government at least faces up to that

25

problem.

Mr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

5

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. WAXMAN:

6

7

please the Court:
I'd like to take the issues presented in the

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

reverse order, if I may.
On the merits as to the third point, the

10
11

assertion Hughes now makes as opposed to the assertion it

12

made in its petition that a claim under the False Claims

13

Act is false and fraudulent only if it involves the

14

submission of an inflated request for payment is quite

15

wrong.

16

As this Court stated 30 years ago in United

17

States v. Neifert-White Company,

18

reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that

19

might result in financial loss to the Government.

20

covers all fraudulent attempts to cause the Government to

21

pay out sums of money."

"The act was intended to

It

That interpretation was expressly endorsed in

22

23

the Senate report accompanying the 1986 amendments, and it

24

is consistent with virtually every decision applying the

25

act.

1

Thus, in our view, whenever a -- a claim is

2

false or fraudulent within the meaning of the act whenever

3

it knowingly misstates facts bearing on the claimant's

4

entitlement to payment or a benefit, regardless of whether

5

the misstatement relates to price, the character or

6

quality of the goods or services provided, the eligibility

7

of the claimant to receive the benefit, or compliance with

8

governing laws, regulations, or contract terms.

9
10

Turning to the second point -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

What if there's just a

11

violation of a contract term that is so minor that it

12

would not be the basis for the Government's refusal to pay

3
4

the contract price?
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, if the misstatement

5

could not as a matter of law have borne on the

6

entitlements claimant, or entitlement to payment, it would

7

not be a violation of the act, and there are many

8

statements that might be false statements under

9

would not qualify.

20

00

that

I mean, if I misstate my social security number,

21

unless there is a very strange regulation that makes it a

22

condition of receipt, it wouldn't be a false claim.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, there also may be some

24

provisions about you have to report this, that, and the

25

other thing.

Let's assume you don't report one thing.

I

1

wouldn't think in the ordinary case the result of that

2

would be the Government can refuse to pay the entire

3

contract.
MR. WAXMAN:

4

I think that's right.

In the

5

ordinary case, unless it was made an express or implied,

6

under the law, condition of payment, it wouldn't relate to

7

a false claim.
QUESTION:

8

9

that.

It has to be the condition of payment.
MR. WAXMAN:

10
11

Yes.

It has to bear on the

entitlement to payment in some way.
QUESTION:

12

3

So you're willing to be committed to

Is that another way of saying it must

be material?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.
Yes.
In fact, I think, although the

7

courts have torn themselves inside out trying to determine

8

whether in this provision and the criminal false claims

9

provision materiality is an element, in fact, to the

20

extent materiality is an element, it really is embedded in

21

the test of whether it bears on entitlement to payment or

22

a benefit.

23

I mean, taking this Court's definition from

24

Gaudin and Kungys, the natural tendency to influence or be

25

capable of influencing the decisionmaker seems to

2

is one that is capable of influencing.

Any fact that bears on entitlement

With respect to the public disclosure bar, we

4

believe that allegations and transactions are publicly

5

disclosed by the Government whenever they are revealed to

6

a member of the public outside the Government other than

7

to the suspected wrongdoer.

8

9

In the context of a corporate wrongdoer, I will
rush to the test that Justice Breyer identified as a clear

10

minimal definition and state that, since corporations can

11

only act through individuals, the test should be whether

12

the persons to whom the Government disclosed the

13

allegations or transactions received the information in

14

his or her capacity as an employee or agent of the

15

corporation, not just as an individual who happens to be

16

an employee.

QUESTION:

What about a disclosure to, say, not

just to Hughes but to Northrop in a case like this?
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think a disclosure to

20

Northrop would be in most instances a public disclosure.

21

Northrop actually is the whistleblower in this case, and I

22

think a disclosure to Northrop or Northrop employees would

23

have to be considered a disclosure to a member of the

24

public, in this case the paradigm qui tarn relator.

it is very important for this Court to announce some sort

2

of bright line rule so that we can apply this, this

3

provision, let me give you some examples of -QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Waxman, before you do that,

5

have you -- are you changing your position from what the

6

Government -- I didn't understand that to be the

7

Government's position in its briefs.
I thought the brief was not whether it's

8

9

disclosed to the employee as an employee or as a member of

10

the public, but rather, whether the employee to whom it

11

was disclosed had an obligation to keep it secret or was

12

free to disclose it to the rest of the public.

statement, but we -- in an effort to create a bright

line --

QUESTION:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

So you --- we are saying that if it's

23

disclosed, either by the Government or by Hughes

management, to someone in the corporation because they're

25

a corporate employee, that's not public disclosure.

On the other hand, if someone who happens to be

1
2

a public -- a corporate employee files an FOIA request,

3

and obtains it, that is a public disclosure.
If the Government, the Attorney General,

pursuant to her authority under 3733, files a civil --

6

sends a civil investigative demand out to persons who may

have knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing and one of them

happens to be a corporate employee, that is a public

2

With respect to retroactivity --

3

QUESTION:

On that point, with respect to

4

retroactivity, assume this is not a jurisdictional bar.

5

Assume we think that Congress has eliminated a defense.

6

Should the statute be applied retroactively?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

We think that the statute is not

8

truly retroactive even taking your point about the defense

9

as against a qui tam relator, because this Court stated in

10

Landgraf that a statute has genuine retroactive effect

11

only where the statute would either impair rights a party

12

possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for

13

past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to

14

transactions already completed.

15
16

QUESTION:

Here --

So how does it work with the statute

of limitations?
MR. WAXMAN:

Here, application of the new qui

18

tam provisions will not impair any legal rights that

19

Hughes possessed when it acted, it will not increase any

20

Hughes legal liability for its past conduct, and it will

21

not impose any new legal duties on Hughes with respect to
