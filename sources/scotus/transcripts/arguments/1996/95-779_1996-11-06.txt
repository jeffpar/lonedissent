ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONSTANTINE JOHN GEKAS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER WALTERS
MR. GEKAS:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the construction of Section

12

13

701(b) of Title VII, which defines the term "employer" as

14

follows:

15

person engaged in an industry affecting commerce, who has

16

15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or

17

more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar

18

year, and any -- any agent of such person.

19

The term "employer," says the statute, means a

We seek review of the holding of the Seventh

20

Circuit in this case, which was that the words, "for each

21

working day," can only be construed to have meaning under

22

a test that counts employees only on the days that they

23

are present at work or on the days that they are on paid

24

leave, except for salaried employees.

25

employees, the Seventh Circuit said it makes no difference

And for salaried

1

where they are, what they're doing or how they're paid.
We believe that this is wrong for several

2

3

reasons.

First of all, because the plain text of the

4

statute focuses on the ongoing employment relationship.

5

Second of all, because the suggestion of the Seventh

6

Circuit and all the other courts which have considered the

7

-- the meaning of the phrase,

8

are wrong when they say that only this day-by-day method

9

gives that phrase meaning.

"for each working day," they

And, thirdly, because if the

10

text is ambiguous -- and there is some suggestion, just

11

because of the stark split in the courts on this, that

12

perhaps the statute is ambiguous -- that the legislative

13

history and the purpose intent of Congress, the policy

14

underlying Title VII, and the EEOC's own administrative

15

interpretation of the -- of the statute and those words

16

favor the payroll method --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, what would be an example

18

of the kind of a person -- the -- the kind of job they

19

held -- who was counted under your view but not counted

20

under the Seventy Circuit's view?
MR. GEKAS:

21

Well, under our view, all employees

22

who have an ongoing employment relationship would be

23

counted.

24

employee, for example, who works 4 days out of the week,

25

but not the fifth day -- assuming a Monday to Friday

Under the Seventh Circuit's test, a part-time

2

case, we have assumed ourselves past the problem of

3

defining the term "workday" or "workweek," and we've

4

basically focused on the question of whether or not there

5

is a necessity to focus on whether or not someone's at

6

work or not.

7

QUESTION:

With this

Well, what if the employee is --

8

shows up for work one day a month to do some accounting

9

work and, therefore, is kept on the employer's so-called

10

overall list of employees to do this stuff one day a month

That's right.

QUESTION:

Because there's an

We submit that it's --

Well, what if the person is listed,

17

hasn't been taken off the computer base, but in fact

18

hasn't done any work for, let's say, 4 months; do we count

19

that person for the 4 months?

20

MR. GEKAS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that that

21

focuses on the question of whether or not, during the time

22

that the person is not there, that person is an employee.

23

There is a body of law, both from this Court -- Darden and

24

Reid and the recent decision last year, NLRB against Town

25

& Country, that sets forth a set of criteria having to do

with control.
And I would submit that, in that circumstance,

2

3

where there's ambiguity because of some long period of

4

time for which the employee is not present, that the

5

courts would look really at the -- at the circumstance of

6

the employee under those tests of employment control --

7

presence at work is one of them -- and it doesn't really

8

present, in our view -- that hypothetical doesn't really

9

present, in our view, the issue that's presented in this

10

case.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GEKAS:

13

QUESTION:

But there are some questions?
Yes, it's questions, but question -Do you completely endorse the

14

Department of Labor's regulations, adopting the payroll

15

method for the Family Leave Act?

16
17

MR. GEKAS:

Yes, we have, generally.

Do we

completely endorse -- endorse it?

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GEKAS:

Uh-huh.
Yes, we do.

We think that that's a

20

very sensible application for a couple of reasons.

21

seems to us that it has to do, in part, to the deference

22

issue that's presented by the court --by this case,

23

rather -- and it -- it -- one thing that the Department of

24

Labor regulations do suggest and do show is that this is a

25

reasonable interpretation.

QUESTION:

And so --

What does it -- what does it mean

8

when the statute says that the EEOC -- it not only does

9

not specifically confer rulemaking authority on the EEOC,

10

but it specifically denies rulemaking authority to the

11

EEOC?

12

that the EEOC is not to be given the -- the authority to

13

give content to the statute that most agencies possess?

Isn't -- isn't that a reflection in the statute

14

MR. GEKAS:

Well, clearly, under the case law,

15

as I understand it, that is a distinction about the degree

16

of deference that is given.

17

this -- and Mr. Waxman, of course, can speak more

18

authoritatively -- but looking at the question of the

19

Court's last two or three decisions in the EEOC area about

20

deference, Commercial Office Products -- and I think it's

21

Gilbert -- General Electric against Gilbert in the ARAMCO

22

case -- it seems to me that the deference issue for the

23

EEOC is treated somewhat differently between Commercial

24

Office Products on the one hand and ARAMCO and Gilbert on

25

the other.

It seems to me, in looking at

And as Your Honor -8

Yes, you did, indeed.

I was -- I was about to say --

authorship for that, but to attribute it to Your Honor's

MR. GEKAS:

And the point is I think that,

11

whatever the test -- whatever the test is, whether it's

12

the Commercial Office Products test or the Strickland test

from the -- the

decision of the EEOC fares fairly well here, because --

1

reasonableness and the validity of the reasoning, the

2

power of the persuasive force, it seems to me, is enhanced

3

by the fact that the Department of Labor has reached the

same conclusion; Congress, in adopting a different

statute, has reached the same conclusion -QUESTION:

10

anything other than the deference we would give to, for

example, unanimity of opinion among respected academic

12

commentators?

13

MR. GEKAS:

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's -You know, Williston and Corbin, and

15

if -- if -- you give certain deference to their views.

16

Does it mean anything more than that?

17

MR. GEKAS:

Well, that kind of detailed criteria

18

is not contained in the more recent decisions on that.

19

would say that there is -- there -- there is some force,

some rational force, to the EEOC's interpretation, whether

or not --

about?
MR. GEKAS:

2

Well, I'm saying -- I'm saying that

if the -- if the test is the Skidmore test, then it's --

this regulation satisfies it, because it has rational

force, internally coherent, sensibly based on the

statutory language.

Seventh Circuit and the other cases that go against it,

And there is also some unanimity of

thought both your interpretation and the EEOC's required

that somebody be a current employee.

Now -- now, I would like to ask what

10

sense it would make to take your person who comes in once

12

count the person who has worked, let's say,

0 hours a day

3

for 4 days, but leaves the job permanently on the fifth

day?

5

MR. GEKAS:

Well, with any reasonable test,

6

there are going to be hypotheticals, I think, perhaps more

7

infrequent in practice than not, that suggest that, at the

8

fringes, maybe the rule doesn't have intuitive sense.

1

nothing untoward in this scheme, which is one designed to

2

protect employees from discrimination.

3

QUESTION:

But, more specifically, you're

4

talking about the portion of the scheme that creates a

5

small business exemption.

6

sense to call a business a small business if it has 15

7

full-time employees who come in 5 days a week, but -- I'm

8

sorry -- 14, who -- who come in 5 days a week, call it a

9

small business, and therefore not covered by this; but if

Do you think it makes much

10

it has the same product, the same total amount of work,

11

but, instead, has 28 people, each of whom do part-time

12

work, and -- and come in only half a week, then it becomes

13

a large business?

QUESTION:

That doesn't seem to me to make much

MR. GEKAS:

Well, the reason for it is because

sense.

18

Congress had to draw a line somewhere.

19

matter is the legislative history shows very clearly --

20

Senator Dirksen's colloquy with his colleagues shows very

21

clearly what they wanted was a bright-line test, not just

22

to avoid complications in handling these cases in the EEOC

23

and in the judiciary --

24
25

QUESTION:

The fact of the

Well, it certainly could be a

bright-line test to say that the term,

1

2

were there each working day.

3

MR. GEKAS:

That's a bright-line test.

If there's any experience from this

4

case that we can gain, it is that that test, the working

5

day test, is not a bright-line test.

6

experience for us to go through the process of trying to

7

figure out who was present at work --

calculate, but the rule was clear.

It was an agonizing

Well -You could determine each person for

each working day, could you not?
MR. GEKAS:

Well, when I say statement of -- of

14

bright-line rule, I don't mean just one that can be easily

15

stated and capsulized in a phrase.

16

easily stated, but also easily applied.

QUESTION:

I mean one that can be

that, to the extent that the Senate debates focussed on

ease of administration -- and they did to a great extent

1

interpretation, I take it that an individual could be

2

employed by three or four different employers?

3

MR. GEKAS:

Absolutely correct.

And the -- the

4

case law under the various labor statutes says that

5

someone can be an agent of different masters -- can be a

6

servant of different masters.

7

about that.

So there's nothing untoward

To amplify a little bit on my answer to Your

8

9

Honor, Justice O'Connor, it seems to me that it's

10

important to realize that these two tests are not

11

exclusive.

12

for the respondents includes the test that we say, because

13

you have to be an employee, you have to be in an

14

employment relationship to be counted for the purposes of

15

-- for the purpose of his test.

16

The test that Mr. Falahee is going to advocate

You go on to determine whether or not someone is

17

at work or on leave.

18

whether or not they are on paid leave.

19

important analytical point to make here -- that our test

20

is included in their test.

should stop for a variety of policy reasons and ease of

administration, not just in the question of applying --

2

just reading it, without all of these other arguments, one

would tend, I think, rather naturally, to think it means

what it says.

MR. GEKAS:

"for each working day."

I

Well, the -- I guess our point is

6

that you can't read, "for each working day," just in

isolation from the rest of the statute.

8

an employer who has 15 or more employees.

9

that the Government's brief, by the Solicitor General, in

This statute says
And I think

10

this case, for the EEOC, very clearly points out, with

11

citations to appropriate references, that the word "has,"

12

in the context of the other words that are put together,

13

necessarily implies the existence of an employment

relationship.

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is the Government's position that an employer

22

is covered by Title VII when it has an ongoing employment

23

relationship with 15 or more employees for each working

24

day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks.

25

interpretation is correct for several reasons.

We think that

First, this interpretation, unlike the Seventh

Circuit test, fully comports with the text, which states

3

that an employer is a person, quote, who has 15 or more

employees for each working day.

or more employees present for each working day, but if

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10

MR. FALAHEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue before this Court is whether Congress,

12

back in 1964, intended to subject certain small businesses

13

to Federal regulation under Title VII.

14

Congress had the authority to subject virtually

15

all employers to that regulation, but Congress

16

specifically chose not to do so.

17

exclude small businesses by looking to the size of the

18

business's work force.

19

was defined with respect to the number of employees it has

20

working for each day.

statute, nothing in the legislative history, no canons of

22

construction, nor principles of deference to

administrative rulings or agency rulings, supports the

that Congress chose was the number of employees who were

working for an employee, not the number --

Congress chose to measure -- or the yardstick

markedly different from the language that ultimately found

its way into Title VII.

QUESTION:

Well, now, there is identical

language now in the Family Leave Act, is there not?

6

MR. FALAHEE:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

And what is the result there?

Are

8

there specific regulations and so forth that make that

clear?

10

MR. FALAHEE:

11

QUESTION:

12

Congress has --

The -- the payroll method is used, as

it's called?

13

MR. FALAHEE:

Congress has authorized the EEOC

14

to promulgate regulations for purposes of the Family and

15

Medical Leave Act.

16

Your Honor, the payroll method, as it's been described, is

17

the method that the EEOC had advocated.

18

QUESTION:

And pursuant to those regulations,

And that same construction,

19

apparently, is going to apply in ADA and ADEA cases, as

20

well?

21

MR. FALAHEE:

Arguably it could.

I believe the

-- the distinction, however, between the Family and

23

Medical Leave Act and between -- between the Family and

24

Medical Leave Act and between Title VII, the case before

25

declined to authorize the EEOC to promulgate any

2

regulations other than procedural regulations.

QUESTION:

But it is strange, is it not, that at

the end of the day, you might end up with the payroll

method used under the Family Leave Act, ADA, ADAEA, and a

different one under Title VII.

MR. FALAHEE:

9

I -- I find that a little

The possibility of arriving at

inconsistent results does indeed exist.

However, I

10

believe that the focus in this case is to be on the

11

definition of "for each" -- the definition of employee,

12

and the phrase,

13

light of what Congress intended in 1964, not what Congress

14

might have intended decades later, when the Family and

15

Medical Leave Act was -- was adopted.

advocate, it may well be that the regulations under the

I would think you would.

QUESTION:

May I ask you --

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Falahee, you -- you do

recognize that there is at least some legislative history

No -- but why not?

Why not?

Why

11

couldn't you have two work forces, one of them work Monday

12

and Tuesday and the other one works Wednesday, Thursday

and Friday, and each of them has more than

Okay.

Then my second question is, is it not

22

possible that the words,

"for each working day," simply

23

fulfill the function of deciding how long the workweek is?

24

Because some workweeks are 5-day, some are 4, some are 6,

25

and you have to know, for each working day in the week, in

order to determine how long the week is.
MR. FALAHEE:

2

That would be a -- a permissible

3

interpretation of the phrase,

4

QUESTION:

"for each working day."

And without that phrase in it, you

5

wouldn't know whether the whole week had been covered or

6

not?

7

-- nobody works 7 days a week.

He can't say every day of the week, because people

MR. FALAHEE:

I -- I -- I don't believe there

would be a way to determine that, Your Honor, no.
QUESTION:

10

To --

Well, it's been -- it's been argued,

11

or suggested, that the payroll method is much easier to

12

work with.

3

I'm going to ask you if you agree with that,

perhaps with an example.

4

If we were to adopt the payroll method, and an

5

employer had an employee who worked a few weeks in July,

6

and might or might not come back -- it was little bit un

7

-- unclear -- does the employer tell the payroll

9

and take this person's name off?

20
21

Is it subject to some

manipulation?
MR. FALAHEE:

Well, I -- I believe Your -- Your

22

23

one suggested by -- by Justice O'Connor.

24

that hypothetical set of facts, it would really determine

I suppose, under

whether the employer did call up his -- his payroll

2

department or his automated payroll service and instruct

3

the powers that be to remove John Smith or Jane Doe

4

because they're no longer here.

5

QUESTION:

Is there some clerical reason that

6

people are kept on the payroll, because there's a certain

7

amount of information, W-2 forms, et cetera, that it --

8

it's -- so it's just much easier to carry them forward

9

than to keep putting them back on and taking them off

10
11

every time?
MR. FALAHEE:

Well, while -- while an -- an

12

employer is required to maintain certain information for

13

tax purposes, particularly to generate W-2 forms at the

14

end of the year, I think the -- the answer to -- to Your

15

Honor's question would really depend on what type of a

16

payroll service was -- was being utilized.

17

could probably differ from case to case, depending upon --

18

upon the method of maintaining the payroll.

19

respect to an automated payroll system, I suggest that,

20

depending on the way that system works, there could be

21

different outcomes.

QUESTION:

I think that

And even with

Those -- and there were

employees on each of those days, and they were all the

same employees -- they -- they would be covered under the

Act, would they not?
MR. FALAHEE:

Yes.

Under -- under our approach, yes.

Those employees -QUESTION:

Because,

means that there are 4 working days, and they're there all

MR. FALAHEE:

QUESTION:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

But they wouldn't be covered if -- if

the -- if the business stayed open a fifth day and brought

in only one employee, right?

to do it -(Laughter.)

is -- does a working day happen?

3

when an employer does not conduct its full operations?

4

And I believe there -- there have been some lower court

5

cases recognizing that, in -- in -- in hypotheticals

6

similar to Your Honor's, that fifth day would not be

7

counted as a working day, to avoid precisely that result.
QUESTION:

8

9

Is -- is it a working day?

In other words,

Is there a working day

But, Mr. Falahee, I'm confused by

your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, because I

10

thought that it would be the other way on your method.

11

That is, take someone's 5-day week -- regular 5-day week

12

-- but this person works 10 hours a day, 4 days a week.

13

thought, under your method, that person would not count as

14

an employee, because that person is -- is not employed for

15

each working day?

16

MR. FALAHEE:

No, Your Honor.

Under -- under

17

the -- under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the count

18

would be 15 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

19

And, apart from the -- the four -- from the working day

20

issue, the issue of whether that fifth day is a working

21

day, as Justice Scalia had -- has asked, that one

22

individual who comes in on Friday would be -- would be

23

counted.

24

QUESTION:

Who doesn't come in on Friday.

QUESTION:

But the -- the question that I have

is you have 15 every day for -- for 4 days.

work 8 hours.

3

and so doesn't come in on the last day.

-- the fifth day, they're only 14 people.

But there's one person who works 10 hours,

MR. FALAHEE:

No.

So, on the last
I thought,

In -- in that particular

week, in a case in which the 15th individual does not
report for work on Friday, that individual -QUESTION:

So, in any week, somebody who comes

12

in 4 days a week, 10 hours a day, is not counted as an

13

employee for that week for this purpose?

14
15
16

MR. FALAHEE:

That -- that individual would be

counted for the days he or she worked.
QUESTION:

Is -- but that individual would never

17

be someone who has worked for each working day.

18

had that person the whole year -- just what I described --

19

15 people, but one of them works 4 days a week, 10 hours a

20

day, that employer would not come within Title VII, right?

21

MR. FALAHEE:

So if you

set of facts, carried forward for 52 weeks, that -- that

As -- as to the focus, yes, Your

Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, except you don't really say

compensated for that day, whether they show up or not.

That's not the -- the -- you would say

MR. FALAHEE:

1

Well, if the -- if the Christmas

bonus test used the same language as Title VII, I believe

3

we would have to apply the same test.

4

it would really depend on what the -- what the language of

the Christmas bonus policy was, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6

I think -- I think

Well, the bonus was you -- you get a

7

dollar a day for every day you're on the payroll, even

8

though you didn't work certain days.

9

compensation test, it'd seem to me he'd be an employee.

Under your

10

That's different from showing up at work, because you -- I

11

think you agreed with Justice Scalia, your test is not

12

presence, because you take people on sick leave and so

3

forth.

4

that any element of compensation that would accrue to a

5

person on the payroll at the end of the year or for -- for

6

any -- any benefit whatsoever, would make that person an

MR. FALAHEE:

No, Your Honor.

No.

The -- the

-- the -- the concept of a -- of a Christmas bonus, as --

as I understand it, is -- is typically an extra check at

the end of the year.

earned pro rata for -- for a period of employment.

I'd assume, other things being equal, Congress would want

to say is administratively easier.

5

It tends to look administratively easier.

MR. FALAHEE:

And

There -- there are several answers

6

to that question, Your Honor.

First of all, there is no

7

indication from either the statutory language or from the

8

legislative history of Title VII that Congress was

9

concerned about writing a test that would necessarily be

10

easy to implement.

11

however, that Congress was concerned about writing a test

12

that would be accurate, in terms of measuring the size of

13

a small business.

14

I think it's reasonable to assume,

And as this Court noted in Consumer Product

15

Safety Commission against GTE, the fact that a particular

16

interpretation might produce a result, or might -- might

-- might produce a burdensome result is not sufficient to

18

overcome an otherwise reasonable interpretation of the

19

statute.

20

interpretation of -- of the definition in Section 701(b)

is that it reads the phrase, "for each working day,"
