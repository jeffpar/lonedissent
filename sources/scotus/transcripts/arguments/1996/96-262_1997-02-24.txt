CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

Number 96-262, Jon Edmond v. United States.

Mr. Morrison.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MORRISON:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The question presented by this case is whether the

11

civilian judges of the Courts of Criminal Appeal of the Coast

12

Guard were properly appointed.

13

questions:

14

statutory authority to make the appointment, and 2) if he did,

15

is it constitutional for him to have done so because the

16

officers are principal offices rather than inferior officers.

17

In actuality, there are two

1) did the Secretary of Transportation have the

Congress first provided for civilian appellate judges in

18

the armed services in 1950, with the passage of the Uniform

19

Code of Military Justice, in particular, Article 66(a).

20

was available to all of the armed services, but the

21

legislative history is clear that it was intended principally

22

for the use of the Coast Guard.

It

23

Until 1993, the Coast Guard used civilian judges and,

24

like all of the other military judges who were appointed to

25

the military appellate panels, they were appointed, as they

were for the other armed services, by the person known as the

2

Judge Advocate General of the armed services, which in the

3

case of the Coast Guard is the general counsel of the

4

Transportation Department, and before that the general counsel

5

of the Treasury Department.

position by statute is the -QUESTION:

12

MR. MORRISON:

14

In the Transportation

Department -- there is no one in the Coast Guard.

11

13

That is correct.

General --- general counsel of the Department of

Transportation.
In 1993, the Court of Military Review for the Coast

15

Guard, as it was then known, recognized that there were

16

serious Appointments Clause problems with respect to the

17

civilian members of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review.

18

The problem arose because the Judge Advocate General is

19

clearly not one of those listed persons in the Appointments

20

Clause and therefore cannot constitutionally be designated as

21

an appointing officer even for inferior officers.

22

As part of its opinion in a case called Senior, the

23

Coast Guard Court of Military Review asked the Secretary of

24

Transportation to "reappoint" all of the civilian judges, and

25

he did that.

5
1

In fact, he did that for all of the judges of the Coast

2

Guard Court of Military Review, and although he did not cite

3

49 U.S.C. section 323(a), or, in fact, any other provision,

4

that is the statute on which the Government relies, and the

5

first question presented is, is that reliance justified?

6

The Government recognizes that, despite the broad

7

language of section 323 (a) , it cannot be used if there is

8

another statute that provides for another method of

9

appointment for this particular office or any other.

10

The question in this case arises because Article 66(a)

11

does not use the word, appointment.

12

initially establish, and then constitute, but the history is

13

clear that from 1950 until 1993, it was the Judge Advocate

14

General who actually did the appointing for the civilians.

15

The Government says because the word appointment wasn't used

16

we should not - -

17
18
19

QUESTION:

It uses -- it used

Well, Article 66 speaks in terms of

assigning, doesn't it, not appointing?
MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

Well, it first talks about

20

constitute and establish, and then it uses the word

21

assignment.

22

That is correct, Your Honor.

The Government argues from that that it should not be

23

treated as an alternative method of appointment.

24

answer we have to that is that it has been construed by the

25

agencies all across the military from 1950 to 1993 as

The first

providing the appointment power.
Indeed, there is no other provision of law that would

3

allow the appointment of civilian judges in the Coast Guard.

4

There certainly was nothing from 1950 to 1968 -- '66, when the

5

Coast Guard was transferred from the Treasury Department --

QUESTION:

But there weren't any civilian judges in the

other branches, were there?
MR. MORRISON:
also in the Navy.
QUESTION:

MR. MORRISON:

For how long?
It's in note 2 of my brief, Your Honor.

I'll --

Yes.

And it's also recognized in the

Well, the Coast Guard is the only place where

civilian judges are now used --

18

MR. MORRISON:

19

QUESTION:

That is correct.

--at the present time, and I guess -- I

20

mean, even if 866(a) were invalid, you still -- as long as

21

they are inferior officers you could look to 49 U.S. Code

22

323(a), I suppose, for the Coast Guard, for appointment by the

23

Secretary of Transportation.

24
25

MR. MORRISON:

Well, that gets to our -- that is the

question, Your Honor, whether you can, and the Coast Guard --

7

QUESTION:

1

Well, I just thought there was a fall-back

2

statute, so until you get to whether they're principal or

3

inferior officers, I'm not sure you can address your first

4

question.
MR. MORRISON:

5

No, Your Honor, I think not.

I think

6

that the question of whether 323(a) is a fall-back statute or

7

not is very much of an open question, and we first suggest

8

that 66(a) has been treated as though it were an Appointment

9

Clause in all of the armed -- in all of the armed service

10

appointment statutes, in all of the armed services, including

11

the Coast Guard, and the history is absolutely clear that it

12

has been construed that way, for there is no other source of

13

appointment.

14

But - -

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this, which gets further

15

into this principal or inferior business.

16

officers are there at present, more than 250,000 and some?

17

QUESTION:

And are all of those people principal

officers?

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

No.
I don't believe so.

So as far as you're --

It's never --

8
1

MR. MORRISON:

2

QUESTION:

-- been tested.

-- concerned, if one of those military

3

officers is reassigned to a principal office, then it would

4

require a new appointment and confirmation?

5

MR. MORRISON:

No, Your Honor.

The Appointment Clause

6

requires a method of appointment.

In - - under our

7

constitutional scheme, every inferior officer of the United

8

States could be appointed by the President with the advice and

9

consent of the Senate.
The Congress is given the option to make a law that

10
11

provides for one of three alternative methods of appointment,

12

but the fact that somebody is appointed by the President with

13

the advice and consent of the Senate does not make them, by

14

that alone, a principal officer, but --

15
16

QUESTION:

But you do - - you accept Weiss, in other

words.

17

MR. MORRISON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MORRISON:

20

Now, the Government seems to say that under the scheme

21

that they have devised using 323(a) to rescue them -- and by

22

the way, Justice O'Connor, there was a very simple solution in

23

1993 when this problem was recognized.

24
25

I have no choice, Your Honor.

You aren't suggesting any invalidity there?
Yes -- yes, Your Honor.

All the Government had to do at that point was to ask
the President of the United States to appoint the civilian

9
1

judges with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the

2

problem would have been cured prospectively at that point,

3

so - -

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, isn't that a bit much, when you

5

think of all of the ALJ's, all of the people who perform

6

comparable functions, the trial people at the tax court, and

7

to take this officer, as important as his job is, and to say

8

that this intermediate appellate judge is a principal

9

officer -MR. MORRISON:

10
11

Well, I'll be glad to turn to that

question, Your Honor.
First, let me - - our principal focus on the principal

12

13

officer point is twofold.

One is that these judges have very,

14

very broad powers of review, and second that they have

15

practical finality.
That latter characteristic distinguishes them from the

16
17

trial judges that Your Honor was talking about, the ALJ's, all

18

of whose decisions are reviewable as of right.

19

Judges' decisions by the Coast Guard Court of Military

20

Review and of the other armed services are reviewable on a

21

discretionary basis only, certiorari, in essence, to the Court

22

of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and less than 4 percent of

23

those cases get taken.

24
25

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

You say ALJ's are reviewable

as

MR. MORRISON:

2

QUESTION:

3

Of right.

The decisions --

Are routinely and automatically reviewed?

I'm not - -

4

MR. MORRISON:

As of right, Your Honor.

Yes, that is

5

correct.

6

cites on pages 26 and 27 of its brief, and obviously there may

7

be some ALJ some place whose decisions are not, but my

8

understanding of the basic structure of the APA is that every

9

person who is dissatisfied with the decision by the ALJ can at

10

least go to an agency head and in most cases to a court of law

11

as of right, in contradistinction to this case, in which the

12

reviews are entirely discretionary.

13

Certainly in all of the examples that the Government

world?

17
18

MR. MORRISON:

Isn't that a strange

It certainly is, Your Honor.

Sorry, you

mean the military officers, or the civilians, because --

19

QUESTION:

Both.

20

MR. MORRISON:

As far as the military officers are

21

concerned, they may be assigned by the general counsel, but

22

under Weiss, under this Court's decision in Weiss, the Court

23

held that there was no separate appointment required for them.

24
25

QUESTION:

But on your theory they jump from being, some

of them at least, inferior officers to superior officers based

on the general counsel's appointment, or assignment, rather.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MORRISON:

4

All of them do.

All of them do, unless --

All of the appellate judges, yes.

We're

not talking about trial judges here.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but --

6

MR. MORRISON:

They may well be -- it is entirely

7

possible for various officers in the military to reach certain

8

points in which they may be principal officers.

9

That is, for instance, somebody could be a high-ranking

10

person that could be a principal officer in the military.

11

Without knowing what the duties are, I couldn't tell for sure.

12

I would say the likelihood is not great, but there are

3

probably not very many in the Coast Guard, other than the

4

Commandant of the Coast Guard.

5

QUESTION:

As I understand your theory, what you do have

6

to say on your theory is that those who are not at the

7

superior level by virtue of their military appointments as

8

such suddenly become superior officers by virtue of this

9

assignment to sit on a court.

20

MR. MORRISON:

That is correct, Your Honor, and that

21

is -- but that is constitutionally acceptable, as this Court

22

held in Weiss, because they were appointed as principal

23

officers along the way.

24
25

QUESTION:

We didn't hold that in Weiss.

We left open

was involved, but as I recall the opinion for the Court never

2

addressed it.

MR. MORRISON:

5

QUESTION:

I'm talking about the problem of having a

6

requirement for the appointment of superior - - of principal

7

officers which can be evaded by simply having an inferior

8

officer reassigned to a task that is the task of a principal

9

officer, never appointing that inferior officer by the method

10

set forth in the Constitution.

11

it?

12

That's a real problem, isn't

I mean, I think it's a real problem.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, I think it is, but my burden today

13

is a more limited burden, which is for the civilians who were

14

never appointed by the President with the advice and consent

15

of the Senate to positions in the Coast Guard, that they

16

cannot be reassigned or anything by the Judge Advocate General

17

to these positions.

18

QUESTION:

Well, of course --

19

QUESTION:

But --

20

QUESTION:

It goes to the heart of your whole

21

contention, because it goes to the question of whether it is

22

reasonable to interpret 66 as you ask us to interpret it, as

23

being an authorization to appoint these people.

24
25

MR. MORRISON:

No, Your Honor, I - - well, we know for a

fact that -- and I don't believe the Government disputes this.

13
1

From 1950 until 1993, Article 66 was the only provision relied

2

upon for the appointment of civilians to the Courts of

3

Military Review for the Coast Guard and for the Navy, which is

4

the only two services that had them, and so insofar as that

5

fact is concerned, it's not disputed.

6

I would say, however, if the Court agrees with me on my

7

first issue -- that is, on the first, the statutory

8

construction issue, the Court need not reach this

9

constitutional question.

10

It simply says, the Secretary of Transportation,

11

construing the statutes together, does not have the authority

12

in part because it produces a series of results with regard to

13

the courts of military review that don't make any sense.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, but we do know that Congress

15

wanted to have these tribunals, and -- including civilians.

16

If we take your interpretation of the statute, then we are

17

demolishing what Congress wanted.

18

view that 323 -- is that what it is? -- can supplement 66,

19

then we save what Congress plainly wanted to do, so why

20

doesn't the statutory argument turn against you?

21

MR. MORRISON:

If we take the Government's

Well, we have two rules of construction

22

in conflict.

One is to try to save the statute, as Your Honor

23

has just suggested.

24

constitutional question, which I have suggested also comes

25

into effect here.

The other is to try to avoid the

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

14
1

But there is another way, of course, to have saved this

2

statute, which is to have had the President of the United

3

States make these appointments in January 1993, instead of

4

going through the short-cut of having the Secretary of

5

Transportation do it, because under the Constitution the

6

President has the power to appoint all officers of the United

7

States with the advice and consent of the Senate.

8

The only time he does not have that power is when

9

Congress expressly by law takes it away from him and gives it

10

in a valid law to somebody else.

11

civilians in the Coast Guard -- appointments by the Judge

12

Advocate General -- was not a valid law, the President's

13

residual power would come forward.

14

QUESTION:

Since the law as applied to

But the President's resid -- you make it

15

sound as though this was totally within the control of the

16

executive, but it wasn't, because the President's power is the

17

power to appoint by and with the advice and consent of the

18

Senate, not alone.

MR. MORRISON:

MR. MORRISON:

It would be --

24

MR. MORRISON:

25

That is correct, Your Honor.

So -I agree with that.

Well, not -- I think probably not, Your

Honor, as a practical matter.

There are two judges at this

point in the Coast Guard.

2

have been serving.

3

with appointment, but I don't think this would come within --

4

QUESTION:

The President says, these people

He reappoints them.

There are problems

It would be a fairly unusual provision,

5

though, for the office to be filled by presidential

6

appointment with advice and consent of the Senate for

7

officials of -- this far down the ladder.

8

9

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I don't know that that's -- I view

them as comparable to people in the -- as tax court judges,

10

Your Honor, and tax court judges are appointed by the

11

President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

12

There are various administrative boards whose members

13

are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of

14

the Senate.

15

There would, of course, be one anomaly, which is that

16

you would have some people who are chosen by the President and

17

other people who are chosen either by JAG or the Secretary of

18

Transportation.

19

That's what we're concerned about here.

If the Government's view is upheld, we have a situation

20

in which some of the members of the Coast Guard Court of

21

Criminal Appeals will be appointed by the President --by the

22

JAG, selected, assigned, chosen by the JAG, if I may use

23

neutral terms -- others will be appointed by the Secretary of

24

Transportation.

25

Article 66(a) specifically says that the chief judge of

QUESTION:

It says chosen I believe, Your Honor.

Well, that's quite different from appointed.
Well, in this --

It can mean -- chosen can mean selecting from

someone who already holds the office.

QUESTION:

MR. MORRISON:

10

Does Article 66 use the word appointed there?

Designated.

12

QUESTION:

Well, that's even further from appointed.

13

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, except that in this case if you look

appendix at A7 -- I'm sorry, at A6.

17

He has -- the Secretary of Transportation has designated

18

Chief Judge Baum, the only civilian, as the chief judge of the

19

court.

20

That is contrary to what the statute says.
Similarly, the statute --we have a situation, supposing

the Secretary get to fill it by appointment?

2

we would know, we would have a larger number of civilian

3

judges.

4

The next thing

I say this not because it's an insuperable problem, but

5

it creates a situation which seems to be very different from

6

what's created by the statute here.

7
8

QUESTION:

the JAG has to do what the Secretary tells him.

9
10
11

Well, it's not insuperable at all, given that

MR. MORRISON:

Well, Your Honor, that's not entirely

true.
QUESTION:

Any power given to the JAG, unless it's

12

expressly or implicitly limited to him alone, is certainly

13

exercisable by the Secretary, is it not?

14

MR. MORRISON:

Well, the JAG is independently -- general

15

counsel is appointed by the President with the advice and

16

consent of the Senate, and I don't think that the general

17

counsel of the Transportation Department could be removed by

18

the Secretary of Transportation if the President wanted to

19

keep him.

20

QUESTION:

It's not a question of removing him.

It's a

21

question of the Secretary saying, I know that this function is

22

assigned to you, but you are my subordinate, and I am going to

23

exercise this function directly myself.

24
25

MR. MORRISON:

Can't that be done?

Well, I think that's the question, but

it's by no means clear that that's correct, and the reason I

18
1

say that is because there are other things about this statute

2

which suggest that although Congress didn't use the word

3

exclusively here, that it did intend for the JAG's to be in

4

charge of the process.

5

QUESTION:

As this Court recognized --

Sure, and it intends, for example, in the

6

Justice Department for the subordinate heads of the divisions

7

to do what they want, but doesn't the Attorney General have

8

the power to direct them to do it the way he wants?

9

MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor --

10

QUESTION:

Even though it sets forth their duties?

11

QUESTION:

That's Andrew Jackson and the Bank of the

12

13

United States.
MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Well, that's right,

14

except that as I suggested --he said he would fire his

15

Secretary till he finds one that agrees with him.

16

suggest to you that the general counsel cannot necessarily be

17

fired by the Secretary of Transportation because the general

18

counsel is a presidential appointee.

Here, I

19

But there's an important set of reasons why I would say

20

that the Justice Department analogy doesn't apply, other than

21

the fact that there are no specific duties listed for most

22

high-ranking officials in the Justice Department.

23

says there shall be 11 Assistant Attorneys Generals who shall

24

carry out the duties.

25

It simply

Here, in Article 66, I believe the fair reading is that

1

Congress has constructed a system in which they are taking the

2

control over the workings of the courts of military review, or

3

now courts of criminal appeal, out of the line authority.

4

That is, from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of

5

Transportation, and put the control in the lawyers.
That is to prevent what this Court recognized in Weiss

6

7

was the possibility of improper command influence, and this

8

shows up in the selection of the chief judge, in the fact that

9

the

-- by the JAG, by the fact that the JAG designates who

10

shall sit on what panels, by the fact that the rules for the

11

courts of military review are decided by the JAG's, and that

12

the JAG's are regularly scheduled to meet on practices and

13

procedures.

14

This is more than simply interstitial law-making.

15

is, in our view, a deliberate decision by the congress to say,

16

for whatever reason - - and I suggest that there are many good

17

ones relating to command influence -- we want the JAG's rather

18

than the departmental heads to be involved in this process.

QUESTION:

This

Well, suppose they wanted the JAG's --

20

Congress passed a statute and said, we want the JAG's to do

21

all the appointing.

22

We want them to.

That's their job.

And one day somebody walked into Congress and said, you

23

know, you've made a little mistake here, because unfortunately

24

under the Constitution the civilian person doesn't have a

25

presidential appointment, and you've got to give the power to

So Congress says, ah, great idea.

We'll say he can be

appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

right?

5

MR. MORRISON:

6

QUESTION:

That cures it,

That is correct, Your Honor.

All right, and they say, you know, it could

7

come up again, so why don't we pass our statute in general

form and just say the Secretary of the Treasury can appoint

officers, and that would cure it, I guess.

He's an officer.

MR. MORRISON:

Well --

I mean, that's the difficulty I'm having,

okay as a curative statute.

Well, that --

It would certainly be okay as a specific

curative statute.

20

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

There's no question about that.

You could put the specific word in general

22

form, and if somebody points out you already have the statute

23

you don't need to pass it.

MR. MORRISON:

My submission is that this general

It's not -- in the words that this Court used just

3

recently in the Robinson v. Shell Oil case in part 2A of its

4

opinion, even were the plain language to apply, the result

5

must also be consistent and coherent and workable, and I

6

suggest to you that implying the authorization for the

7

Secretary of Transportation to make the appointment here runs

8

up against that problem, and therefore you should construe

9

this not to do so.

10

QUESTION:

But why?

11

QUESTION:

Well, how much implying are you doing when

12

the statute says the Secretary of Transportation may appoint

13

and fix the pay of officers and employees of the Department of

Transportation?

15

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I misspoke, Your Honor.

Let me

16

suggest this.

17

doesn't dispute it, that if there is another specific

18

statutory scheme for appointment of other officers, as there

19

is -- for instance, there's a general counsel in the

appointment whether the person is an inferior officer or not,

QUESTION:

But certainly there can be situations in

which more than one statute apply, can't there?
MR. MORRISON:

6

Yes, and the question is, did Congress

7

intend to allow this to apply, given the lengths to which they

8

went in Article 66(a)?

9

Now, there are two advantages in accepting this

10

approach.

11

so that Congress can look at this and say, now, which makes

12

sense?

13
14

Which system do we want to have?
Because the legislative history is clear that Congress

has never focused on the Appointments Clause - QUESTION:

case.

Congress can say, gee, we passed a fall-back

statute that covers this, and maybe we don't want to cover it

again, and the advantage is that you do not for reasons of

appointment formality disrupt a great many things that have

question, to which I'd now like to return.
As I said before, my two principal arguments on the

enormous power.

Every bad conduct

As the court of military appeals said in 1990 in the

10

Cole case, this is an awesome plenary power of de novo review

11

of facts and law.

12

of facts.

There is an unusually broad power of review

13

As Article 66, quoted on page 3 of our brief, says,

14

judges may weigh evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses,

15

and determine controverted issues, questions of fact,

16

recognizing the trial court had the opportunity to see and

17

hear the witnesses.

18

That's an extraordinary power of review, far broader

19

than the judges of the court of appeals have in our Federal

20

criminal system.

21

QUESTION:

Well, but it's no broader than the authority

22

of a district court to review the findings of a special

23

master, is it?

24
25

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I would say that that is correct.

Your Honor.

The Government has never suggested otherwise.

But the second -- and the second reason is the question

3

of finality, and that gets me to my Freytag point, which is

4

that in Freytag this Court ruled that the chief judge of the

5

tax court had the authority to appoint inferior officers, and

6

in my view, implicit in that decision was a recognition that

7

the judges of the tax court had to be principal officers, for

8

otherwise you would have a system in which inferior officers

9

were appointing other inferior officers, precisely the

10

diffusion of power and accountability the Appointment

Clause - -

QUESTION:

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

15
16

There are some differences -There are, Your Honor.

-- and for example there's a fixed tenure for

tax court judges that doesn't exist here.
MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Government makes a

point of that.

most important with respect to the office rather than the

19

office-holder.

20

My view on that is that the tenure question is

Surely, for example, if the Secretary of Transportation

21

for the last 40 years had had terms -- the Secretary of

22

Transportation serves at the will of the President.

23

could show that he was only there for a year or two each time

before there was a turnover, nobody would say they aren't

principal officers.

General exclusive power to select members of the courts of

QUESTION:

Are Coast Guard officers appointed in the

same manner as the officers of other services?
MR. STEWART:

Yes, they are.

They're appointed by the

14

President and confirmed by the Senate, and as with officers in

15

the other branches a separate appointment is required for a

16

promotion to a higher rank.

QUESTION:

So the -- 323 does not apply to Coast Guard

officers in the Coast Guard.

QUESTION:

Mr. --

QUESTION:

27
1

statute that not only is addressed particularly to the office

2

in question, but that provides an inconsistent method of

3

appointment.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, you were giving several reasons

5

why you say these officers are inferior, and yet in one sense

6

they do have more power than even a normal court of appeals

7

judge in the Federal system would have, insofar as they make

8

de novo fact-finding and so forth.

9

MR. STEWART:

It's correct that with respect to the

10

scope of review in cases falling within their jurisdiction a

11

court of criminal appeals may engage in de novo fact-finding

12

as opposed to the clearly erroneous standard that would apply

13

in the civilian courts.

14

In other respects, however, the powers of the courts of

15

criminal appeals are more limited.

16

obviously, the courts of criminal appeals hear cases falling

17

within a narrow class of jurisdiction, in contrast to Article

18

III courts of appeals, who can hear the full range of civil

19

and criminal cases.

Well, with respect to ambassadors,

QUESTION:

If I'm appointed as an independent counsel

for a little tiny offense, am I not a principal officer, as - -

10
11

12

13

MR. STEWART:

No.

The Court held in Morrison that it's

an inferior officer rather than a principal officer.
QUESTION:

Coast Guard court does sit in review on officers who were

themselves appointed by the President and confirmed by the

That seems to me a very substantial function.

MR. STEWART:

This

That's correct, but again in terms of the

19

limited nature of the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard Court of

Criminal Appeals,

21

hears only a small category of cases, but in the sense that

22

the only people potentially subject to its jurisdiction are

respects its review of court martial decisions is more limited

To what extent is it subject, in other words,

to control by some superior officer?
MR. STEWART:

11
12

Well, there are --

Well, all of its decisions are subject to

review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
There are two categories of cases as to which the Court

13
14

of Appeals for the Armed Forces exercises mandatory review.

15

Those are cases in which the Coast Guard Court of Criminal

Appeals has affirmed sentence of death, and cases in which the

Judge Advocate General of the service certifies the case for

decision which is not effectively subject to reversal by --

13
14

QUESTION:

Should that enter the balance on whether we

think it's an inferior officer?
MR. STEWART:

I think it enters the balance, but I think

15

the more important point is that in ensuring the practical

16

subordinacy of the court of criminal appeals within the

17

military justice system, the important point is that the Court

18

of Appeals for the Armed Forces may review all questions of

19

law, and the court of criminal appeals is subordinate not

20

simply in the sense that it is subject to reversal in an

21

individual case, but in the sense that it is obligated to

follow the precedents laid down by the Court of Appeals for

I think under our theory they were not

to the Secretary's January '93 memorandum were not properly

And to return to the point I was making earlier, in some

respects the court of criminal appeals' review of court

martial decisions is more limited than that which would occur

in an Article III court in the criminal context.

18

under the Sentencing Reform Act, a court of appeals within the

19

Federal system may hear a Government appeal from a district

court sentencing determination and may determine that the

21

sentence was not harsh enough.

22

That is,

In the military justice system, by contrast, Article 66

makes it clear that the review of the court of criminal

appeals is limited to the sentence as entered by the court

martial and approved by the convening authority.

MR. STEWART:

Well, we conceded in - - the Government

conceded in Weiss at oral argument and we would concede here

that if judges on the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals

were principal officers, there would be a substantial

civilian judges but as - - but of the military judges as well.

Now, with respect to the statutory question --

What you don't agree with is that it would be

MR. STEWART:

point that an inferior officer who was appointed by the

With respect to the statutory question, we

specifically contemplated that the Secretary's authority would

be used with respect to civilian judges on the Coast Guard

In our view, that's simply not the

23

The question first is whether section 323(a) by its

terms authorizes the Secretary to act, and we think it's clear

25

that it does.

Section 323(a) says specifically that the

Secretary of Transportation may appoint officers

employees within the Department.

3

and

There's no question that a judge on the Coast Guard

4

Court of Criminal Appeals is an officer within the Department

5

of Transportation, and so the real question is, does Article

6

66 of the UCMJ divest the Secretary of the authority that he

7

would otherwise possess with respect to these civilian judges,

8

and we think for two reasons that it shouldn't be read that

9

way.

10

First, Article 66 doesn't use the word appoint.

It says

11

the Judge Advocate General can establish a court of criminal

12

appeals, refers to judges assigned to that court, but there's

13

no plain language that would suggest that the Judge Advocate

14

General makes appointments at all, let alone that he is the

15

sole appointing authority.

16

With respect to one point made by the petitioners, in

17

our view the legislative history makes clear and this Court's

18

opinion in Weiss makes clear that the point of vesting this

19

authority in the Judge Advocate General was to remove the

20

matter from the influence of the commanding officer who

21

convened the court martial, not to remove the decision from

22

the control of the Secretary of Transportation and, indeed, if

23

Congress' purpose were to make it impossible for the Secretary

24

of Transportation to influence the assignment process, it

25

would have been bizarre to give assignment authority to - -

QUESTION:

1

But is it true -- but I take it that nobody

2

ever thought about this problem at all in Congress, so we're

3

not -- it's just totally imaginary to think what they were

thinking.

point, and so I think the argument is that just as you

responded to Justice Kennedy you said, well, look, the

Secretary under this clause doesn't appoint officers of the

Coast Guard, does he?

They weren't thinking anything, and the -- on this

No, because there's another provision for

that.

He says, well, read this provision.

12

provision fairly read says is that the JAG was going to do the

13

appointing, and just as the officer of the Coast Guard

14

provision is -- everybody understood that, and they know that

15

this general catch-all doesn't apply to that, so everybody

16

here understood that the JAG would do the appointing, and so

17

the catch-all doesn't apply to that, either.

MR. STEWART:

What's your response to that?
The definiteness of the language is one

point, but I think what we would say is even more important is

25

that the JAG is a subordinate official within the Department

1

of Transportation who is subject by statute to the Secretary's

2

control and who could be directed by the Secretary to assign a

3

particular individual to the court of criminal appeals.

4

And therefore while it would - - it would obviously

5

disrupt the statutory scheme for the Secretary of

6

Transportation to purport to appoint commissioned officers

7

within the Coast Guard, because that would subvert in a very

8

practical way the process that Congress had established for

9

making people a part of the Coast Guard, since the Secretary

10

could, in any event, direct the JAG to assign a particular

11

individual to the court of criminal appeals, there's no

12

practical disruption --

QUESTION:

MR. STEWART:

Well ---by saying that the Secretary can

exercise that authority himself.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the statute pertain to commissioning

of Coast Guard officers read the same way?

same way other officers are?

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

Aren't they

That's correct.

Mr. Stewart, isn't it, beyond that, your

22

position that to read the language here, which does not say

23

appoint, to mean appoint the civilian officers -- the civilian

24

judges would be unconstitutional?

25

think the JAG is the head of a Department.

Is that not -- unless you

You don't think

38
1

2

he's the head of a Department, do you?
MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

But the JAG certainly

3

could not assign civilian judges to the court without an

4

appointment from someone else, so - -

5

QUESTION:

So essentially petitioner is asking that

6

66(a) be interpreted, although it doesn't say it explicitly,

7

in a fashion that is unconstitutional.

8

9

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct, in a fashion

that's unconstitutional and also in a fashion that would

10

subvert Congress' intention that the services, and

11

particularly the Coast Guard, should be able to use civilian

12

judges.

That is I think -- one important point is that to the

13
14

QUESTION:

I think his point was that you -- how far do

15

you go in stretching 323 in order to rescue a scheme that

16

would be unconstitutional if you didn't stretch 323?

17

MR. STEWART:

I mean, with respect, we agree with the

18

Chief Justice that it's not a stretch.

19

categorically that the Secretary of Transportation may appoint

20

officers and employees within the Department.

21

Article 323(a) says

The only remotely difficult question is not whether

22

323(a) applies by its terms, but whether Article 66 takes away

23

the authority that was otherwise conferred, and we think it's

24

important to point out that to the extent that we can hazard

25

an educated guess as to what Congress anticipated, neither

39
1

side in this case is arguing that the system should work in

2

precisely the manner that Congress expected.

3

That is, probably Congress expected that the JAG's would

4

be solely responsible for placing individuals on the courts of

5

criminal appeals, but it surely expected that the pool of

6

potential judges would include all civilians who were members

7

of the bar of a Federal court, or the highest court of the

8

State, and we know that it can't work that way.

9

both sole authority in the JAG and that pool of judges, and

10

therefore it can't be a dispositive objection to our theory

11

that Congress didn't anticipate that it would work that way.

12

To the extent that Congress' expectations are relevant

We can't have

13

at all, the more accurate question is, which approach

14

preserves more of what Congress wanted than the other one, and

15

we think it would clearly have been more important to Congress

16

that the potential pool of judges remain the same, rather than

17

that the authority be lodged in the Judge Advocate General

18

rather than the Secretary, because the Secretary in any event

19

could direct the JAG to appoint -- to assign whatever

individuals he wanted.

MR. MORRISON:

I'd just like to add to Mr. Stewart's

2

response to Justice O'Connor's question about the de novo

3

review.

4

Forces cannot review sentences in the same way that the courts

5

of criminal appeals can do, and so that's an additional power

6

that extends beyond it.

7

In addition, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

For better or for worse, the Constitution creates only

8

two categories of officers of the United States.

9

either be principal officers or inferior officers and, thus,

10

if the Court reads 323(a) the way that Mr. Stewart suggests,

11

the Court must then face the constitutional question of

12

whether on balance these officers are more like principal

13

officers or more like inferior officers.

14

They must

We believe that the comparisons with the courts are the

15

most relevant comparisons, and that compared with the judges

16

of the tax court and other similar judges, these judges, who

17

deal not simply with money but with liberty and life in some

18

cases, are sufficiently important -- they're sufficient --

19

QUESTION:

On that subject, Mr. Morrison, do I

20

understand your argument to be that prospectively, if you're

21

right -- I know that you have a client concern -- because

22

there is the important liberty interest that you describe, all

23

of the judges of this tribunal would be military and none

24

would be civilian?

MR. MORRISON:

Congress could correct it, that is correct, Your Honor.

So -Unless the President - - as I said before,

the President -QUESTION:

If you prevail then, of course, there's one

7

result for your clients, but the result for the system is that

8

unless and until Congress does something further, all of the

9

judges must be military people.

10

MR. MORRISON:

No, Your Honor, that is not correct.

As

11

I said before, the President could step in tomorrow and send

12

these nominations to the Senate, and as soon as they were

13

confirmed, that would be constitutionally sufficient, because

14

under the Appointments Clause the President has the ultimate

15

fall-back authority to make these appointments and to cure the

16

constitutional defect.

17

So the question then is, under this choice that the

18

Court must make if it agrees with the Government's submission

19

on 323(a), are they more like principal officers or are they

20

more like inferior officers and we believe that, given their

21

wide-ranging powers and the practical finality of their

22

decisions, the balance favors principal rather than inferior

23

officers.

If the Court has no further questions --
