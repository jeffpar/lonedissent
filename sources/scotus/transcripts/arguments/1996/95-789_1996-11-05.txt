ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. REA

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. REA:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
California seeks reversal of Dillingham because

13

our California law does not relate to ERISA plans.

14

if it did, the relationship is one which is under another

15

Federal statute and regulation, the Fitzgerald Act, which

16

ERISA may not modify and impair.

17

Even

I would like to begin with the second argument,

18

because it allows me to talk about the practical effects

19

on apprenticeship of the Dillingham rule.

20

QUESTION:

But before you do that, could you

21

tell me, counsel, it seemed to be conceded by both sides,

22

certainly by Dillingham, that this is a plan.

MR. REA:

The answer, Justice Kennedy, depends

on which this.

at the point it got approved it became a registered

MR. REA:

QUESTION:

Well, are there apprenticeship

Yes, Your Honor.
And do those exist, or is this -- is

that just a hypothetical?
MR. REA:

10

No, that's not a hypothetical.

Of

11

course, the State doesn't know much about them if they

12

don't come to us for registration.

3

QUESTION:

-- apprentice programs that are not

ERISA plans?
MR. REA:

Yes, Your Honor.

We are -- our law is

4

indifferent as to whether they're covered by ERISA, and

5

the Fitzgerald Act has nothing to say about the areas of

6

ERISA concern, funding, money in or money out.

9

QUESTION:
by unfunded?

But those are the ones that you meant

You spoke of unfunded plans a moment ago.

MR. REA:

Yes.

The Secretary of Labor's

10

definition, we use unfunded as shorthand, and our law --

11

if someone comes to us and wants to register a plan or

12

have an apprentice work on public works we don't inquire

13

whether they're ERISA-covered or not.

14

if they meet the Fitzgerald Act standards, which we've

15

incorporated in our State law.

16

QUESTION:

17
18

We'll approve him

What do you mean by unfunded again?

Would you clarify that?
MR. REA:

That there is no trust fund or

19

arrangement by which the employer or a group of employers

20

put in money and then use that to pay for the operation of

21

the training.

22

23

QUESTION:

Is it easier to get certification if

you do have funding?

1

history of the Fitzgerald Act, these plans were being

2

organized during the Depression, when everybody had more

3

time than money, and single employer plans, typically

4

there's no reason, because apprenticeship is so closely

5

associated with work, to go to the trouble of setting up a

6

fund.

7

QUESTION:

Well, thank you.

That was, I

8

thought, a preliminary that helps me before you address

9

the points you were going to address.

10

MR. REA:

One of the reasons, Justice Kennedy,

11

why it's not -- we've asked ourselves the same question.

12

We can't tell how many funded plans there are because we

13

never asked the question in the registration process.

14

The effects of the Ninth Circuit rule that

15

States really have no business insisting that those paid

16

as apprentices under our public works be registered

17

apprentices would modify and impair the Fitzgerald Act,

18

because that act directs the Secretary of Labor to promote

19

standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of

20

apprentices, and to - -

21

QUESTION:

But the Fitzgerald Act is, you know,

22

I think precatory, isn't it, kind of a feel-good type of

23

thing that doesn't really impose any specific legal

24

requirements on anybody?

but it's not merely precatory either.

invites the States into a partnership.

It directs the

the policy of the United States, I'd be constrained to

agree with you, but it doesn't.
It directs the Secretary to promote, and the

history shows that they promote and formulate standards,

11

and this particular definition of apprenticeship at issue

12

here through the Fitzgerald Act and through the

13

regulations we rely on both the act, which is somewhat

14

general, and the rather long tail of regulations which

15

have followed from it.
We rely on both of those for our Savings Clause

they'll be able to not only do our work, but they'll be

We're very, very concerned with the

who do our jails in the future.

We want to have a skilled

11

workforce available even for such things as wireless.
It's our -- and the standards under the

12

13

Fitzgerald Act address those concerns very directly,

14

because they say that the people who will be brought on as

15

apprentices will have a commitment of at least 2,000

16

hours -- this is not just something tinkered together for

17

the plan -- that they'll have related and supplemental

instructions so that they'll have some theory behind what

19

they're doing, that they'll be - - most importantly to us,

we're here, because Dillingham said we are having funds,

our funds are being withheld from us.

20

not -- it's not that you can do this if you like, but if

21

you don't do it you won't get paid.

22

MR. REA:

That's coercive,

The coercive aspect is in the

23

prevailing wage law.

We set a prevail -- like most,

24

almost the majority of the States we set a prevailing wage

25

for public works for various reasons, and if you

1

misclassify or mispay someone, we will make you pay the

2

difference in a small penalty.

That is coercive, as here.

3

The reason apprenticeship is involved is because

4

when caught with this mispayment the contractor's response

5

was, oh, these are apprentices, so meeting apprenticeship

6

standards is voluntary, but when you get caught fooling us

7

about who the apprentices are, we'll apply the prevailing

8

wage law, as here.

9

QUESTION:

You are not -- going back to Justice

10

Kennedy's question you are not agreeing with the AFL-CIO

11

position that the training program is different from the

12

provision, the financial arrangement for gaining the

13

training, so that the training program itself, as

14

distinguished from how one pays for it, is not under

15

ERISA.

16

seem to reject that argument.

You seem not to - - you and the Government both

17

MR. REA:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. REA:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
And why?
The reason we're taking that position

20

is because, although it provides a neat answer in this

21

case, it addresses more -- it addresses larger issues of

22

ERISA jurisprudence than we need to answer, particularly

23

because you'd have the same question about funded-unfunded

24

in day-care centers and legal services plans and we think

25

we've bitten off enough without trying to answer those.

The funding-un -- nonfunded distinction in the

1

Department of Labor's definition seems to us to make sense

in apprenticeship, without trying to make a broader rule,

because apprentice -QUESTION:

MR. REA:

QUESTION:

4
5

It's ordinary work.
Is there any other case that

addresses that like -MR. REA:

the intera --

There's no other case.

The only

6

things in ERISA which are in the list of possible benefits

7

provided by an ERISA-covered arrangement that are similar

8

to this are vacations, because they're so much like
ordinary work, but apprenticeship or other training, and

10

other training is clearly covered in the same phrase, are,

11

showing up for work, getting assignments from your

12

supervisor, doing those, earning as you go, and that's why

13

it's so closely tied to work.

14

I believe the reasons stated by the Department

15

of Labor and the Federal Register section quoted in the

16

United States brief for using funding was because of the

17

great difficulty in separating out apprenticeship or other

18

training from ordinary work.

1

that you get after work, or health benefits that you buy

20

in a package and are handed.

21

and the only way they really had to keep from federalizing

22

vast areas of American employment law was by saying, well,

23

when it's funded, we'll look at the special ERISA-related

24

problems that funding brings.

defines an employee welfare benefit plan, does include in

2

terms apprenticeship or other training programs.

3

no way to get around that, is there.

4

MR. REA:

There's

There's no way to get around that, and

5

certainly we think it deserves the same treatment as the

6

issue of vacations, that there is a definitional problem

7

that this Court recognized in Morash, and you have to

8

resolve it with the purpose of what Congress wanted to

9

cover in benefit provision arrangements, and the Secretary

10
11

has I think made the best effort at that.
The problems that we have in operation of the

12

Dillingham law touch each of the groups mentioned in the

13

Fitzgerald Act.

14

programs that meet the Federal standards, they invest in

15

their apprentices, and -- especially in the early years.

16

That raises their labor costs.

As to the contractors, those who join

17

Every time that they lose a job to someone like

18

Sound Systems, Inc. who's just using temporary installers

19

and calling them apprentices, that discourages their

20

participation in plans.

21

as much as losing bids.

22

Nothing discourages contractors

As to the apprentices, the second effect on

23

State jobs where the temporary installers work is, those

24

are jobs on which the apprentices and registered programs

25

can't earn any money and can't learn anything.

Those

Those that manage to

This really discourages the use - - shrinking the

8

pool discourages the use of apprentices on Federal

9

proj ects.

10

The third problem is that having wildly

11

different kinds of work experience called apprenticeship

12

by two different levels of Government, and under the

13

Dillingham rule there will be State apprenticeship, which

14

can be pulling wires and hanging speakers, and somebody

15

telling you to go to school, and then registered

16

apprenticeship, where you, you know, engage and commit to

17

this long course of study.

18

That confuses the private sector that we rely on

19

to make the system work.

20

that train apprentices, and people thinking of going into

21

apprenticeship.

22

The contractors, the schools

The fourth bad effect of the Dillingham rule is

23

admittedly a prediction.

For nearly 60 years, the States

24

have been willing to engage in this partnership for high

25

quality standards.

We use the definition of apprentice,

1

the Federal Davis-Bacon uses it, all of these Federal laws

2

use it, other laws of ours, like minimum wage, use it.

3

If we can't use that definition, if we're forced

4

to take people like temporary installers as our

5

apprentices, the States will give the job back to the

6

Feds.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Rea, come back to the preemption

8

question.

I don't understand why the Federal Government

9

cannot continue to cooperate with the States, whether or

10

not this particular law of California is held to be

11

preempted.
All that the act requires is that the Secretary

12

3

of Labor is directed to cooperate with State agencies

4

engaged in the formulation and promotion of standards of

5

apprenticeship.

6

continue to set forth standards of apprenticeship.

7

only question is whether California can consistently, with

8

ERISA, enforce those standards by excluding ERISA plan

9

apprentices from State contracts.

It seems to me California agencies could

questions, and let me take them in reverse order.

prohibiting any company from calling something a, quote

requirements, which is a good deal short of this.

12

would promote genuine apprenticeship programs so that

somebody doesn't enrol in a program which really doesn't

MR. REA:

That

I suppose it would, but our interest

is not only truth in advertising and promotion but also

the State's interest, because -- in really getting

apprenticeship back for that wage rate, because those are

19

our youth, those are our trainees, and, frankly, that's

our jail.

The other point I would like to address is, the

22

Dillingham rule really interferes with the interest in

23

uniformity that motivated much of ERISA.

the need for uniformity was that uniformity promotes the

furtherance of benefits.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

14
15
16

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's the position of the United States that the

17

judgment in this case should be reversed, both because the

18

State's prevailing wage law does not relate to ERISA plans

19

and because, if it did, it would be saved under the

20

section 114040 -- 1144(d) savings clause.

21

With regard to the relates-to issue, our

22

position is that the general principle is that where a

23

State is regulating an activity, that an employer may

24

carry out through an ERISA plan or may carry out through a

25

non-ERISA plan, and where the State's regulation neither

1

encourages nor discourages, nor prohibits nor requires the

2

employer from doing it by means of the ERISA plan, that

3

the State regulation is not preempted.

4

In that case, it would be most natural to say

5

that the State's regulation relates to the activity at

6

issue, here training programs, and not to ERISA plans.

7

Now, in Shaw v. Delta Airlines, if you look at

8

the last few pages, the last issue that the Court dealt

9

with in its opinion in that case concerned a New York

10

State regulation of disability insurance.

11

that disability insurance could be offered either by an

12

employer through an ERISA plan, or it could be offered

13

through a non-ERISA plan.

14

It was clear

The Court held that even for those employees who

15

choose to offer it through an ERISA plan, that that

16

doesn't render -- they can't thereby immunize themselves

17

from the State's regulation.

18

19

therefore the State could continue to enforce those

regulations.

The difference is that as the

is, where it's just the -- it's impossible to distinguish

MR. FELDMAN:

No, but it is.

It is, I think, in

at the wording throughout the statute where it talks about

give was, if you take a --

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

If you look

No, I didn't mean -If you take an internship at a

7

hospital, which is very much like an apprenticeship

8

program, and it's certainly a training program, according

9

to the Ninth Circuit's rule in this case -- and an

10

internship could be organized with a separate, as an ERISA

11

plan, and in our view it could be organized as a non-

12

ERISA training program.

13

Under the rule that California -- that the Ninth

14

Circuit adopted in this case, the State would be entirely

15

disabled from regulating how many interns -- how many

doctors you need to supervise interns in a hospital, under

17

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

That's right.

And Morash recognized that, and if

you don't read it whole this way, in effect you are going

to federalize a vast area of State activity which in fact

has nothing to do with the -- with kind of the gut notion

6

of administering trust funds.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

That's exactly right, and if

That was

You could do that.

11

QUESTION:

Just as you could --

MR. FELDMAN:

But you have to look at it in the

context of the whole statute and what Congress was trying

to accomplish here.

QUESTION:

So if that's so, and -- the fact that

an employer sets aside a trust fund to buy vacations for

his employees does not make all the travel agencies and

MR. FELDMAN:

Because -- I think because the

set up is not going to some outside provider.
QUESTION:

6

Well, in other words, if the vacation

travel agent happens to be somebody who does the

employer's vacation planning, the travel business becomes

an ERISA program?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

No, I don't think that's right,

reality.

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't it mean that in any

4

case like this, for example, in which the employer in

5

effect wanted to exempt himself from the apprenticeship

6

obligations and the wage differential that that implies,

7

he would have a perfect way to do it simply by agreeing to

the apprenticeship scheme as part of his contract, then

9

funding his apprenticeship scheme with a trust fund like

10

this, then claiming on your theory that all of the State

11

regulations on apprenticeships relate to the plan and

12

becoming free of the regulations?

if he thought in this particular instance it was in his

interest to do that?

Would that, then, leave your client

in the same position that the client is in if the State

apprenticeship scheme under the contract?
MR. HILL:

8

Well, I think the difference between

my client's situation and the one I just outlined is that

written standards, with supplemental training, with a wage

12

progression that corresponds to periods of training,

3

in effect, his apprenticeship obligations, and by virtue

of having done it by an ERISA plan he now claims that

The incentive, the carrot, as it were, under the

they can bid on Federal public works projects and other

You could always create a

Isn't that your response?
I think my answer is yes, as long as

you set up an apprenticeship plan that meets the ERISA

10

standard, and that may be very different from the State

11

standard of what an apprenticeship training program ought

12

to be.

QUESTION:

The definitions section mentions

11

12

that the quality standards imposed on day care by the

State are removed, would it?

MR. HILL:

QUESTION:

Well then, that's what -- I'm

struggling with this statute that lists them in a row,

20

believe that you could set up a day-care center and escape

all the State regulations, quality controls on that, if

you put it under the head of ERISA, so why should it be

different for training?

system, this voluntary system that the Federal Fitzgerald

2

Act regulations set up the standards that one must meet in

3

order to gain Federal approval, and I think it's that.

4

It's the incentive of complying with that system that

5

makes this case -- makes apprenticeship unique among

6

employee welfare benefit plans.

7

QUESTION:

Why isn't it easier to make a

8

different kind of classification and in effect respond to

9

the problem that Justice Scalia raised that in theory you

10

could oust any State regulation by forming an ERISA plan?

11

And the answer to the classification I have in

12

mind is, if the ERISA plan is in fact funding what is a

13

requirement of a traditional area of State regulation,

14

which I dare say apprenticeship is, the regulation of day­

15

care centers is, and so on, just as the regulation of

16

hospital rates could be, then the fact that there is an

17

ERISA plan does not so connect the plan to the area of

18

regulation as to require preemption.

19

answer here?

MR. HILL:

Why isn't that the

Well, I guess my response to that is

21

that the connection in a case like this is that the

in that way, you are interfering with the congressional --

4

QUESTION:

No, but you're not interfering with

5

the plan if the object of the plan is to fund whatever you

6

are required or permitted to do by or consistent with the

7

traditional State regulation.

8

It seems to me that your argument is circular,

9

and both Justice Ginsburg's question and my question are

10

basically saying, there's got to be a limit to what is

11

connected to or related, and that limit is established by

12

looking for certain areas of traditional State regulation,

13

and if the effect on the ERISA plan is incidental to that

14

regulation, as it would be when a plan is set up simply to

15

fund the regulation, then you don't have preemption.
Why isn't that the answer?

16
17

Why isn't that the

key to this case?
MR. HILL:

I think there are a couple of

MR. HILL:

You also have the risk of, or have the

QUESTION:

What would you disclose about an

MR. HILL:

Well, there may be very limited

disclosure requirements, but you may have to disclose who

is administering the plan, what the relationships of those

12

people are to the participating employers, what the

3

standards are, how one gets training, what kinds of

We have a

And in response to the larger argument made by

10

the Government, it is that once you concede that this

I don't think it necessarily would

apply because that wouldn't be inconsistent with what the

14

apprenticeship program provides.

15

QUESTION:

No, but they say -- the group of

16

employers drafted an apprenticeship program that said they

17

shall wear a different kind of safety gear, less

18

protective of the employee that the State regulation

19

required.

not, why not?

Would that preempt the State regulation, and if

prevailing wage rate you don't preempt everything else.
MR. HILL:

2

And I suppose the only difference

3

about safety is that that is really not an integral part

4

of ordinary apprenticeship programs, but I'm not sure

MR. HILL:

10
11

It is possible that apprenticeship

programs will have safety standards.
QUESTION:

12

Does the California regulation in

question here deal at all with the way the apprenticeship

14

plan is funded?

15

MR. HILL:

I don't believe that the labor code

16

provision makes any distinction between funded or unfunded

17

plans.

18

QUESTION:

But I mean, does it attempt to

19

regulate the funding itself, the way the employer pays in,

20

or the kind of reports he has to make in connection with

21

what he pays in?

22

MR. HILL:

I don't believe there is.

23

QUESTION:

Might not that be a possible

24

distinction, that if the State regulation doesn't deal

25

with the funding aspect, then perhaps it doesn't relate

to?
MR. HILL:

2

Well, again, if -- regardless of

3

whether we have a funded or unfunded plan, if the State is

4

telling the apprenticeship program they can't comply with

5

their own standards, in our view there is preemption, and

6

I think that's what happened in this particular case.

7

QUESTION:

But why doesn't that help --

8

QUESTION:

You wouldn't let the State decide,

9
10

for example, that employers shall not -- shall not have
vacation plans other than a certain type, would you?

11

MR. HILL:

No.

I believe that that --

12

QUESTION:

Don't you think that would be

13

preempted by ERISA, and that doesn't relate to the

14

funding.

15

MR. HILL:

Once you get to the point that a

16

vacation plan is covered by ERISA as opposed to being a

17

Morash-type payroll practice, then yes, that is my

18

position.

19

QUESTION:

Can -- why doesn't it help to cut

20

through the morass just what the Chief Justice said, which

21

is, we make a basic distinction between the funding

22

mechanism, which is the heart of ERISA, and that which the

23

funds are used to buy, and once you get into the second

24

category, the question of whether a State statute relates

25

to ERISA depends.

It all depends.

If it's pensions,

1

that's just money that's being

2

paid out, and it would be harder for the State to survive.

3

If it's day-care centers, or vacations, that's at the

4

other extreme, very, very distant, and this seems more

5

like the other extreme.
But that basic distinction, why isn't that

6
7

really the key to this?
MR. HILL:

8
9

My best response to that is that the

statute does not make that distinction between the

10

funded - - the funding aspects of an apprenticeship program

11

and all the other aspects of the program.

12

requires a judicial gloss on the statute which just isn't

13

apparent from the explicit words of the statute.

14

QUESTION:

Of course, you could have said the

15

same thing about Morash.

16

you?

17

I think that

You don't challenge Morash, do

You don't ask us to reexamine that case, do you?
MR. HILL:

No.

I -- my position is this is a

18

different case because it involves many employers,

22

QUESTION:

it's a

Yes, and involves pension -- I mean,

apprentice rather than vacation.
MR. HILL:

And I believe it is possible to limit

23

this decision to funded apprenticeship programs like we

24

have in this particular case, although that is not the

25

position that I'm advocating here.

Nevertheless,

2

be a way of deciding the case.
In conclusion, I think the point that -- about

3

ERISA and the Fitzgerald Act is that it creates a

4

voluntary system for promoting apprenticeship.

5

are encouraged to create apprenticeship programs with the

6

carrot of being able to participate in Federal public

works projects.

Employers

When the State --

QUESTION:

You could call it that, or you could

call it the stick of not being able to participate in

10

public works projects.

I mean, that's -- whether it's a

11

carrot or a stick is surely in the eye of the beholder,

12

don't you think?
