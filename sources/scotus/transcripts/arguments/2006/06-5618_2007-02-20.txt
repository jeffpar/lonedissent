ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DWYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The district court's 15-month sentence

11

combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned

12

on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a

13

reasonable sentence.

14

tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district

15

judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an

16

individual.

17

doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in

18

every case.

19

disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that

20

deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances

21

to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his

22

family, and to his community.

23

In the uniform and constant

She considered the guidelines and after

She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted

The court of appeals, in contrast to the

24

district court's careful attention to the 3553(a)

25

factors, focused solely on the guidelines.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The court of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule.

2

That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would be your test

of reasonableness for appellate review?

5

MR. DWYER:

I think a sentence would be

6

reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and

7

circumstances of that case would find that the sentence

8

imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to

9

satisfy 3553(a) standards.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that gives

11

very little weight to the goal, which I think is a

12

congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in

13

eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system

14

which cause great disrespect to the justice system.

15

MR. DWYER:

I think that the statute speaks

16

of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of

17

uniformity.

18

the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and

19

concerns about nationwide uniformity.

20

And there is necessarily a tension between

But I think that what distinguishes

21

sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the

22

Presentencing Reform Act system are several.

23

we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors

24

the judge must consider.

time.

One is now

3553 didn't exist before that

Secondly, in every case, as a practical

2

matter, the guidelines are going to exert a

3

gravitational weight because they are there.

be considered as part of the statute.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They must

Can I substitute

6

"substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your

7

position or affecting your position?

8
9

MR. DWYER:

I don't -- my position would be

that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration

10

of the guidelines.

11

a practical matter, I think it's going to get -

12
13

It's just one of seven factors.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
gravity like the Moon.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. DWYER:

As

Kind of a weak law of

It's only at one-seventh.

As a legal matter weak.

As a

16

practical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be

17

very strong.

18

advisory guideline -

19

And I think one of the real dangers of an

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I guess the question

20

is how strong should we say or can we say, or can

21

Congress say it is?

22

MR. DWYER:

I think that the strength should

23

be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I

24

think the danger, particularly after 20 years of

25

guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of

2

exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full

3

limit of 3553(a).

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then it seems to me that

5

to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in

6

this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from

7

the process.

8
9

MR. DWYER:

I think the appellate courts

are -- I think Booker considered a very deferential

10

standard of review.

11

cited to illustrate the standard of review of

12

reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions

13

regarding revocations following supervised release,

14

affirming sentences that were many times what the

15

chapter 7 policy guidelines would require.

16

appeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it

17

pushes the system back into a mandatory -

18

The cases that the Booker Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

The court of

Well, suppose the court of

19

appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but

20

it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever

21

to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own

22

evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in

23

the Sentencing Reform Act.

24

there?

25

MR. DWYER:

Would there be a problem

I think there would,
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of

2

the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for

3

the application and weight applied to the 3553(a)

4

factors for the district court.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

derive from what?

7

Sentencing Reform Act?

8

MR. DWYER:

9

That's a principle that you

From the Sixth Amendment?

From the

From where?
Well, I think it derives in part

from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated

10

individualized sentencing.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Sentencing Reform Act

12

required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges

13

to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines.

14

you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now

15

precludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial

16

judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad

17

discretion?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. DWYER:

And

Certainly extremely broad

discretion.
JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you get that out of

the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?
MR. DWYER:

Even under a mandatory

23

guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it

24

recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an

25

important goal of individualized sentencing.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their

2

institutional position have a special competence to

3

determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a

4

case.

5

competence.

6

of guideline cases.

7

The court of appeals lacks that special
It sees only a tiny fraction of the number
It doesn't have -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So one of the guides

8

for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a

9

particular type of case?

10

MR. DWYER:

I think that what guides the

11

court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to

12

the particular case and determine if the reasons on the

13

record in that case, the district court's -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's impossible to

15

do in the abstract.

16

particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is

17

reasonable or not.

18

so that you know that in this type of case, people

19

usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a

20

sentence of 10 years.

21

ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in

22

determining what's reasonable.

23

If you're just looking at a

There has to be a background to it

MR. DWYER:

And it seems to me that what's

I think the court of appeals'

24

job is to ensure that the district judge provides

25

reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that case that establish that the district court had

2

complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case,

3

selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater

4

than necessary.

5

I don't believe that it is the court of

6

appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a

7

sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh

8

district courts' decisions.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if you're

10

looking at not just the number, but the reasons.

11

other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got

12

nine district judges, they all say we do not depart

13

downward for military service, and you've got one

14

district judge that says we do.

15

the court of appeals can't review that to bring about

16

some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to

17

consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.

18

MR. DWYER:

In

It seems to me that if

I think it is not lawless in the

19

sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether

20

in a particular case, the differences it finds are

21

warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case,

22

whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines,

23

has looked at the history and characteristics of that

24

defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of

25

the crime.

And if those reasons satisfy the court that
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a reasonable judge looking at those facts -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On my particular

3

case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals?

4

They've got two cases before them.

5

departs three years because of military service.

6

prosecutor appeals.

7

depart because of military service and the defendant

8

appeals.

9
10

One, the judge
The

The other, the judge refuses to

Should those -- what should happen with
those two cases?

11

MR. DWYER:

I think the same process of

12

review applies to each.

13

process of review is on the record in that case, would a

14

reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence?

15

And it may result -- and that

And that review may result in both cases

16

being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being

17

reversed.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does that come from

19

as a matter of law?

That is, suppose -- now you can say

20

I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I

21

start with an assumption that Congress did want the

22

court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in

23

sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts

24

of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the

25

sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals

2

create a degree of uniformity.

3

Suppose I start with that assumption and say

4

that's what the guidelines were about and the reason

5

that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among

6

many.

7

guideline bill.

8
9

After all, it was attached to a bill that was the

And indeed, the part we excised was a floor
amendment that came along later to make it even tougher.

10

So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress

11

wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is

12

there something in the Constitution that forbids it?

13

That's where I start -- I am starting

14

personally with that question in mind, always, if this

15

is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless

16

there's something in the Constitution that forbids it.

17

And is there something in the Constitution that would

18

forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they

19

did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it?

20

Now, just going through the different

21

elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that

22

what the district judge did was unreasonable?

23

MR. DWYER:

I think there is a

24

constitutional problem with that.

25

it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system.

And it is that if -

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think if there is to be an effectively advisory system,

2

sentencing cannot center on the guidelines.

3

district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that

4

advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes

5

the focal point for sentencing.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

It's not mandatory.

It

7

says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now,

8

let's think here.

9

sentencing commission that have really looked into that.

We have 8 -- 7 people on the

And they think that in an ordinary course with this

11

small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many

12

months.

13

reasonable to us.

14

him half that or 40 percent of that without a good

15

reason that we can find.

16

That reflects a lot of thought.

Seems

And here the district judge is giving

The judge said he did it because it was just

17

one little episode and we think there were many

18

episodes.

19
20
21
22

And that's basically their reason.
Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment

forbids that?
MR. DWYER:

Of course, the court of appeals

did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. DWYER:

25

In -

Yeah -

The Eighth Circuit in this case

simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extraordinary variance and we are reversing.

2

district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines

3

and generally that must be part of the reason -

4

elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be

5

considered on appeal.

6

The

But the notion somehow that simply because a

7

sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems

8

have been resolved, is clearly not true.

9

briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a

As the amici

10

mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased,

11

regional disparity increased.

12

individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion

13

necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing,

14

can counteract.

It's disparity that

And that is genuine uniformity.

15

As -- as you pointed out in the Koon

16

decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your

17

language from Rivera, the district court's special

18

competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is

19

exactly the kind of information the sentencing

20

commission needs to determine whether a guideline works

21

or doesn't work.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Aren't you really saying

23

that the most weight that the guidelines can be given,

24

or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my

25

voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is,
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the weight of necessary advertence?

2

in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a).

3

rest of them say individualized sentencing.

4

guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the

5

guidelines.

6

The guidelines,
The

The

Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in

7

effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I

8

think the most that you can concede is that before a

9

district judge sentences finally, he must show that he

10

has considered the value of uniformity as something

11

different from individualized sentencing, but that's as

12

much as he can be required to do.

13

Is that a fair statement of your position?

14

MR. DWYER:

Yeah.

And I think 3553(a), in

15

fact -- I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this -- talks about

16

uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4),

17

which requires consideration of the guidelines, and

18

3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted -

19
20

JUSTICE SOUTER:
corrected here.

21

Yes.

I -- I stand

I'm sorry.

MR. DWYER:

But I agree with you that it is

22

a consideration -- and I'm not talking about a check

23

list.

24

enough.

25

advisory system requires reason and judgment.

I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's
There has to -- I think sentencing under an

Alderson Reporting Company

We tried

Official - Subject to Final Review

to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow

2

different.

3

determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the

4

guidelines require.

5

It may involve fact-finding but is not the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, as one of the themes

6

that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is

7

followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over

8

time.

9

I assume they would be adjusted to be more

10

precise, but then we are right back where we started

11

because you want to give the guidelines very little

12

effect.

13

against yourself.

14

It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing

If your view is accepted and the result is

15

considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can

16

do is have mandatory minimums.

17

MR. DWYER:

I don't believe that, that the

18

results are going to be considerable disparity.

19

Certainly no more disparity than existed under the

20

mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed

21

particularly.

22

I think indeed there may be more

23

non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity,

24

because it really is kind of idle to talk about

25

disparity unless you are measuring it against something.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity

2

is measured -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think it is idle to

4

talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act

5

was adopted?

6

You remember those days.

MR. DWYER:

I do remember those days.

And I

7

think there are two significant points about that.

One,

8

judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act,

9

knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served.

10

So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the

11

defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was

12

going to get out soon.

13

The real number was parole eligibility

14

sentencing.

So that looking at just the actual sentence

15

imposed did not tell you very much about disparity.

16

none -- in the study that the sentencing commission in

17

its amicus cited -- that study explicitly said that none

18

of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act

19

interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served

20

as opposed to actual sentences imposed.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, yeah.

And

But there -

22

you know, we can go back into that, but there was a

23

whole history that people testified, tremendously, no

24

opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge

25

wheel.

Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of

2

the judge?

3

across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a

4

possibility of explaining that the judges didn't

5

understand what the parole commission was like.

6

a different issue.

7

And why did you get different sentences

That's

So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we

8

followed your position literally, what we're saying is

9

that the Constitution of the United States prevents any

10

effort to create uniform sentences throughout the

11

country for people who different judges -- God doesn't

12

tell us what the right sentence is.

13

There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range

14

of possible sentences.

15

We don't know.

And you're saying we have to go back to

16

that.

17

for you to tell me something that says we don't have to

18

be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid

19

either.

20

with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.

21

And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words,

And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest

MR. DWYER:

I don't believe that sentencing

22

under an effectively advisory system under the standards

23

of appellate review that I've described, which I think

24

is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty

25

exercise on appeal, and leading simply 17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you describe it

2

again?

3

what the appellate court stance is.

4

appellate court would owe deference to the district

5

court's determination?

6

MR. DWYER:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

Because I'm not clear what your answer was to

Yes.
And no particular

deference to the guidelines?

9
10

I take it the

MR. DWYER:

That would -- yes, I would agree

with that.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?

13

MR. DWYER:

So what is it other

I think that the court of

14

appeals will first look to ensure that there was

15

reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with

16

3553(a), that the district court considered all of the

17

factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was

18

sufficient but not greater than necessary.

19

Secondly, I think that the court of appeals

20

under that deferential standard of review that Booker

21

described would look to see if this is a sentence that a

22

reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater

23

than necessary on those facts.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- one problem is

that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

facts in this very case differently.

That is, one as in

2

this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence

3

him to more than 15 months would throw away his life.

4

Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he

5

just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had

6

been out on that same street every night for two and a

7

half weeks.

8

in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him

9

to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less.

So the quantity is much larger.

And he was

10

Those could be reasonable determinations,

11

two different reactions that judges would have to the

12

same set of facts.

13

MR. DWYER:

Yes.

That is correct.

And I

14

think that is what will result under an effectively

15

advisory system.

16

But here we're talking -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In any case, you -- you,

17

you are not driven to the alternative that

18

Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve

19

absolute uniformity.

20

doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of

prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dwyer, before we get

to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district

court -- different district judges could act reasonably,

9

one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the

10

other giving 15 months, both of those would be

11

reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal.

12

But one of, one of the arguments that was

13

made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there

14

is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack

15

and the penalty for powdered cocaine.

16

Your predecessor thought that was so wrong,

17

he thought it was unconstitutional.

I think at the very

18

least you ought to take into account that if this man

19

were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered

cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the

guideline sentence range would have been six months to a

consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be

free to shape and tailor that advice as the

circumstances of that case require.

19

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

20

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court in Booker concluded that the

23

remedial severing of the statute's provision for

24

mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision

25

governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

statute constitutional.

2

of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on

3

appeal, and it did not elaborate what that

4

reasonableness requirement means.

5

It further implied a standard

The Government submits that the best

6

interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would

7

be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's

8

original intent of minimizing and eliminating

9

unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly

10
11

situated defendants.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

As closely as it can, and

12

the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth

13

Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences

14

determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.

15

Suppose in this case the court of appeals

16

instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it?

17

And then in the next case that comes up involving what

18

was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of

19

cocaine powder rather than crack, okay?

20

next case it would have been 30 grams of powder.

21

the district court judge once again departs just the way

22

the departure was here, and the court of appeals says

23

no, that departure is unreasonable.

24
25

Suppose in the

grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams,

5

decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams.

6

difference does it make whether that factual difference

7

produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of

8

the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a

9

series of opinion by a court of appeals?

10
11

You have

It's a judge who
What

Isn't the

Sixth Amendment equally violated?
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, as I think we

12

talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be

13

if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on

14

appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a

15

commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals

16

does is essentially function as a sentencing commission,

17

literally prescribing particular levels of punishment

18

for recurring sets of facts.

19

The Government's submission here is not that

20

the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a

21

proportionality principle.

22

will look to all of the facts of the case and will try

23

to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in

24

response to all of the facts and circumstances that the

25

judge articulated within -

A proportionality principle

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if you have two cases

2

that are in other respects similar, and the court of

3

appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the

4

guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this

5

judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes

6

up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower

7

sentence.

8

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, he doesn't, Justice

9

Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a

10

judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same

11

level of leniency or any leniency at all.

12

will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at

13

the totality of the facts and conclude whether a

14

sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable

15

sentence.

16

prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that

17

like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the

18

system of reasonableness review on top of advisory

19

guidelines will not produce perfect levels of

20

consistency.

And unlike a situation that some of us might

And what the defendant is entitled to under

22

the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing

23

that if the law says if I commit this crime and these

24

are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is

25

this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's

you.

4

That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles

But no defendant who commits a crack offense

5

can say that even after a series of court of appeals

6

rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness.

7

That defendant will not know whether the judge that he

8

or she appears in front of will give the same kind of

9

weight to those facts as some other judge did who was

10

affirmed or reversed.

11

say what is the constellation of policy and factual

12

reasons that this particular judge will find in

13

announcing the judge's sentence.

14

Nor will that judge be able to

So I don't think that a proportionality

principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.

don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or

17

any other part of the statute.

with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I

submit it should ask the same question that it asked in

the substance of what the district judge does.

It may

reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a

appropriate sentence.

5

concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but

6

beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to

arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away,

8

whether a particular sentence is reasonable.

is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when

12

principle.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that

May I ask this question:

15

It seems to me that in sentencing there are two

16

different broad categories of decision that the judge

17

has to make, one involving the severity of the crime,

18

and the other the characteristics of the particular

19

offender.

20

And might it not be the case that you give a

21

greater presumption of following the guidelines when

22

you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a

23

greater deference to the trial judge when you're

24

evaluating the factors of the individual that might

25

affect the sentence?

There might be a difference in the

MR. DREEBEN:

I think at a high level of

circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that

person's characteristics may map onto the policies of

sentencing.

11

But I don't agree that that distinction

12

would support a two-track form of appellate review that

13

would give the district judge greater deference to take

14

personal characteristics into account and to impose

15

widely varying sentences.

16

that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when

17

any district judge could choose whatever policies of

18

sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and

19

impose a widely disparate sentence.

20

well knows, there was no appellate review of that

21

exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the

22

judge didn't exercise discretion at all.

That is exactly the situation

And as the Court

23

Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a

24

judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same

25

sentence.

That would not take into account the full
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

range of facts and factors that are present in the

2

sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an

3

exercise of discretion.

But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era,

5

the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what

facts mattered.

it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve

You couldn't think those three things?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So one big power a judge

22

has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to

23

say the guideline itself is unreasonable.

24

let's just say -- and there if they say that, the

they'll be few and far between.

4

But leave those cases aside.

I imagine

problem that led to the constitutional problem in

Booker.

3

proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a

typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe

5

what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the

reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker

7

system, that could have been problematic legally.

8

Today, it is not forbidden.

But what it should be

10

that take a look at what are the reasons that the

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why, why do we assume that

13

the district judge cannot depart from the guideline

14

recommendation unless he thinks the guideline

15

recommendation is unreasonable?

He doesn't -- does he

16

have to find it's unreasonable?

There can certainly be

17

two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation

18

to select the guidelines sentence, is he?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So he doesn't have to

21

determine that it's unreasonable.

22

should approach the discussion as though that's, that's

23

the situation.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think we

I do think, though, that the

Court should be concerned about each district judge
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing

2

guidelines and then applying them in the court to the

3

cases that appear on that judge's docket without any

4

check on appellate review to ensure that, although the

5

sentence might be in some possible world reasonable,

6

it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission

7

has prescribed and what other district judges are doing.

8

If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the

9

clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the

10

Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a

11

reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial

12

opinion thought it was accomplishing.

13

remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was

14

providing an important mechanism that Congress itself

15

had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron

16

out sentencing differences.

17
18

What the Booker

And our submission is that inherently means
some form of substantive proportionality review.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the other thing I'm

20

not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason

21

I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means.

22

That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something,

23

but proportional to what?

24

problems.

25

the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and

I mean, I can think of two

One problem, of course, is that the chart in

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to

2

10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to

3

30, it's 2 years.

4

Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether

5

you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just

6

have nothing to do with your reason for departure.

7

might have added on something for having a gun and your

8

reason for being lenient might have to do with the

9

person's having a gun.

You

So you're going to say it make a

10

difference whether you were high up or whether you were

11

low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to

12

do with whether you're high up or whether you were low

13

down?

14

think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to

15

say what's proportional.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

You see?

It doesn't actually work, I don't

I think what is proportional

17

is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that

18

have been using this rule have not had a great deal of

19

difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to

20

which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you

21

look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and

22

have a sense of is this a significant deviation away

23

from what the guidelines would actually describe.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why use the word

"proportional," because the other thing is what the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a

2

person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason

3

justify a little departure rather than a lot?

4

has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot

5

just as much as it might justify a little?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

And if he

If the sentencing court

7

articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's

8

irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the

9

case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at

10

all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate

11

it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the

12

district court to articulate the reasons why the

13

sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an

14

appropriate sentence under 3553(a).

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of

caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.

12

And on that record -- and this is what the

court of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between

14

the judge's conclusion that, with little information

15

more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved

16

leniency versus the fact that he had already had that

chance and he had not -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, supported by the record

is something of a judgment call.

5

that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months

6

after he had previously been arrested for crack

7

offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the

8

very first time after his arrest that he had been in

possession of drugs, that just he got extremely

unlikely, the police caught him.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the court of appeals

12

is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in

13

fact distributed during that 6-month period?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right.

And I would say

15

that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that

16

conclusion.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But should the court of

appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the

case?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Not in my view.

And I think

on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on.

22

It's not a fact that the Government -

MR. DREEBEN:

This aspect of the court of

2

appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the

3

judgment that it reached, which is correct.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It may not have been

5

essential, but it may have contributed to their

judgment.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

It may have, but what they did

8

not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding

9

that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist

10

even though he had no criminal history.

He had been

11

previously arrested for crack distribution crimes.

12

had admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his

13

arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal

crack.

did not really factor that into her sentence at all.

And the court of appeals, although it may

have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that

this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the

20

sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had

21

treated him as, the record does indeed support the court

22

of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant,

despite his criminal history, really looks more like a

recidivist.

2

satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is

3

a first-time offender and meets certain other

4

requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory

minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been

substantially reduced under the guidelines because of

the safety valve and because of his criminal history.

Our view is the judge can look at the facts

productive of unwarranted disparity.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask just one other

15

question?

16

court of appeals can apply a presumption of

unreasonableness just because there's a departure.

18

I do not understand you to argue that the

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

We're not

19

arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal.

20

We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a

21

guidelines sentence.

22

there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the

look and require increasingly strong reasons with the

Perhaps the best way to do this

22

is to give a example.

4

going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she

He didn't take advantage of that

His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm

I submit that in that circumstances the

7

Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines

8

recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and

9

this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is

10

not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very

11

usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this

12

deviation is unreasonable.

13

And I have no problem with a Petitioner

14

making that argument if that's what happens to his or

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, I don't think

2

that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very

3

unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a

4

sentence.

5

courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom

6

sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on

7

this particular constellation of facts.

8

reflect as sense of potential impatience with a

9

ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals

10

says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge,

11

and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day

12

lower.

13

There have been a couple of instances where

I think that

Another solution to that problem would be

14

reassignment to a different judge who would start with a

15

clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion

16

and apply the section 3553 factors.

17

We are not suggesting that the court of

18

appeals should assume the sentencing role here.

19

we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to

20

have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to

21

identify and select unreasonable sentences versus

22

reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory

23

ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't

24

have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark,

25

it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have
45

All

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their

2

tasks.

3

look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the

4

farther that it goes outside the guidelines range,

5

without violating the statute and without violating the

6

Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the

7

Court to ask at that point is which approach, that

8

approach of proportionality, or and approach that

9

basically says appellate review is procedural only,

And if the courts of appeals can do that, can

10

11

to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of

12

uniformity and consistency.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it wouldn't be, just

14

be procedural only.

15

plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on

16

which the district court was -- was proceeding.

17

if you could find that the determination that this was

18

just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an

19

unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER,

suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or

means something different from extraordinary.

19

already demonstrated in our brief why relying on

20

percentages as the court of appeals also did, is

21

pointless, because, one, if -- the arithmetic gets very

22

complicated at the low end and the percentages just

23

don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule

24

of law.

And the Government doesn't

And we've

The Government's proposal, apart from having

2

not susceptible of any kind of application because

3

nobody really knows what it means.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about Mr.

5

Dreeben's parting challenge?

What are you going to do

6

if your client gets 10 years?

You're going to argue

7

that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines,

8

right?

9

MR. DWYER:

I'm certainly going to argue

10

that under the facts and the record before the Court,

11

that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not

12

greater than necessary.

13

prior record, the young man's work history, all of those

14

factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his

15

age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed

16

out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision,

17

could not possibly support a 10-year sentence.

18

And I think the absence of a

And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in

19

a hypothetical sort of way.

But the district judge -

20

and this was a very experienced district judge -

21

looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on

22

judgment.

23

respect in the court of appeals.

24

away as an extraordinary variance.

And that call was not treated with any
