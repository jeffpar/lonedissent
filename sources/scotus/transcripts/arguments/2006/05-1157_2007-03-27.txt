ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The pivotal question in this case is whether

12

this Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require

13

implied antitrust immunity as the district court

14

believed.

15

'33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very

16

purpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market

17

manipulation.

18

as the anchor of Federal economic policy in the

19

securities field.

20

down detailed regulations applicable to the very

21

practices that are at issue in this case with active

22

supervision by the SEC and the NASD.

23

And we submit that the answer is yes.

The

And this Court has referred to these laws

And under these laws the SEC has laid

And it has done this with full understanding

24

that syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted

25

action.

An underwriting requires joint action in
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accumulating information and setting the price of the

2

offering along with allotting shares to customers.

3

Now the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly

4

here because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict

5

which the SEC cited.

6

past, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress

7

required this expert administrative agency to take

8

competition into account when issuing its standards.

9

And review in antitrust courts across the country would

As in cases of this Court in the

10

once again raise the danger of false positives and

11

conflicts and wasteful redundancy.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did it, did it specifically

13

state that, or is it that or just the principle that all

14

Federal agencies have an obligation to -

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very

16

express in 75 and then again in the 96.

17

formation, investor protection and competition have to

18

be weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon

19

this Court attached great importance to that standard,

20

which differs from the competition first standard of,

21

the antitrust laws impose.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Capital

Mr. Shapiro, to what

23

extent has the SEC regulated the specific

24

vertical restraints that are alleged here?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

The SEC regulates the -- the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive

2

compensation claims.

3
4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And laddering, for

example?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Laddering, tying, and

6

excessive compensation.

7

enforcement actions.

8

exactly on those practices.

9

guidance in a document that we attach to our petition

10
11

And it's had a number of

Its regulation M is focused
It's issued very detailed

appendix on what constitutes JUSTICE STEVENS:

And are we to assume that

12

if the allegations are true, which they of course may

13

not be, that this is a violation of the -- of the

14

securities laws?

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well the SEC has said it

16

depends on the circumstances.

17

lines in this area, Your Honor.

18

And they draw very fine

And if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a

19

tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes.

20

But that's the critical issue here.

21

term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but

22

when the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in

23

the Invemed case it found that there was no excessive

24

compensation and no commercial bribery.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is very easy to

And -

How about in this case

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case?

2

And did it take any position?

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

In this case it took no

4

position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it

5

said that there would be serious problems if antitrust

6

law were applied to these allegations.

7

interfere with the agency's ability to define what is

8

manipulation and to amend its definitions.

9

ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to

It would

It has

10

this issue; and it said further that it would discourage

11

underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition,

12

which is very important in this area.

13

Because if they don't step over the line and

14

they engage in book building conversations, that's

15

critical to setting the right price for the IPO.

16

--

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so

How should we, we

18

weigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities,

19

private securities litigation, Congress looked at that

20

and thought some restraint had to be placed on private

21

actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to

22

antitrust private action.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

We think part of the

24

repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that

25

these securities claims have simply been repleaded as
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

antitrust claims.

2

of this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities

3

violations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as

4

antitrust claims.

5

Congress wasn't aware of any problem

And Congress of course relied -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Doesn't, doesn't the

6

statute specifically provide for -- for exactly this

7

possibility?

8

a saving other remedies clause?

9

Doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have

MR. SHAPIRO:

It doesn't refer to antitrust

10

cases.

11

Congress later contracted with the -

12
13
14

Those were references to state law remedies that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Was it -- were those two

clauses expressly limited to state law remedies?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

They referred to other

15

claims, Your Honor, but they don't refer to antitrust.

16

So we don't believe -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20
21

But do they have to?

We don't believe None of the claims includes

an antitrust claim on its face.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we think -- we think

22

they don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD

23

those same provisions were in place but that didn't

24

deter the Court from finding them -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't even think we
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mentioned them.

Did we mention them?

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Pardon me?

those cases?

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

9

Did we mention them in

I don't believe the Court did.
Well, maybe we just forgot.

They -- well, they -- they

don't pertain to antitrust.

If you look at the history

10

of those provisions they are talking about state causes

11

of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such

12

in them.

13

That's quite different from Trinko where

14

there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in

15

detail about saving the antitrust cause of action.

16

The danger of conflict that the SEC is

17

talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to

JUSTICE BREYER:

And here the SEC has expressed its opinion in
The Court is aware of those

11

12

flippings I don't see how in the world you would ever

13

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

If there

Well, Your Honor, the conflict

15

is different, but it's really quite a more serious

16

conflict than it was in Gordon.

17

concern was the SEC might reinstitute fixed rates in the

18

future, and it never did that in 30 years.

19

says the conflict goes to our ability to define

20

manipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the

21

process of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.

22

In Gordon the only

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Here the SEC

Well, Mr. Shapiro,

23

you're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests

24

but your position goes considerably beyond their

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the SEC in the lower

2

courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the

3

Supreme Court, of course, they've -- they've urged for a

4

vacator of the lower court decision.

5

the SG echoes many of the concerns that the SEC

6

expressed in the lower courts.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the brief of

That's why I wonder about

8

primary jurisdiction.

You put a burden on the, on the

9

plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take

10

a range of positions.

court has no business mucking around in this.

could take which was the purpose of the primary

jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the

particular conduct, not general but in the context of

21

the particular conduct, what the agency thought about

22

this in terms of its regulatory mission.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think Gordon is very

24

informative on that point.

It rejected primary

25

jurisdiction because the agency's views were already

But they've not had an opportunity to

Well, what this Court said in

Gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is

sufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if they've

I suppose if primary

22

jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any

23

cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace

That's absolutely right.

In

with the SEC scheme.

7

And

Here we have a pure legal

That's for the Court to decide.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The difference between

8

this case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of

9

their allegations are failure to disclose which is

10

quintessentially the SEC's business, making sure

11

disclosures are right.

12

disclosure, they would have a problem in this case.

13

I missing something on that?

14

I don't think if there were

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, what the SEC says is

15

that if the conduct is ordinary book building,

16

communications about future transactions, at future

17

prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That certainly highlights why

2

this is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems

3

to me, because that -- disclosure is for this

4

administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made

5

clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer

6

welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are

taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments.

Oh, yes.

Under these two

First, the

approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is

collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts

innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting

JUSTICE ALITO:

In light of the very fine

line, how is the Court to distinguish between -

intertwined with authorized conduct?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think if you were

11

looking at a challenge that took place solely within the

12

context of a single IPO, it would probably be so

13

difficult that I think we would concede that you can't

14

practically separate the two.

15

from the standpoint of the Justice Department and its

16

antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an

17

immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a

18

conspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to

19

fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements,

20

or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting

21

process.

suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion,

2

where that conclusion is highly uncertain.

3

And I don't see how your -- your solution of

4

inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of

5

treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I

6

don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any

7

more than the current situation does.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, Justice Scalia I wouldn't want to roll the

10

dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined,

11

with treble damages at the end.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

13

think that you could certainly perform this test and

14

make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect

15

against that threat.

16

threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine

17

line between two closely related areas of conduct.

18

They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a

19

practical matter if the regulated community knows that

20

the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that

21

line will be treble damages in a class action suit.

22

We are certainly sensitive to the

On the other hand, we would caution against

23

adopting some sort of broad immunity that would

24

preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating

25

and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across

Alderson Reporting Company

IPOs.

And of course, the Congress has addressed the

2

problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas.

3

And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the

4

antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between

5

private treble damages suits and Government enforcement

efforts.

Now, that's a little hard to do -

I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no.

the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty

close to what the SG says.

good point, is that you would have to allege facts such

19

that it was clear from the face of the complaint that

you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was -

that's what he means by protected -- and there's an

ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district

judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out

24

of this conduct that is arguably okay.

5

the other hand, applied immunity is an affirmative

6

defense.

7

428 US 579, which didn't make it into our brief, that

8

applied antitrust immunity is an affirmative defense.

9

As we brief, there's a long line of cases from Your

10

Honors that say that you don't have to plead in the

11

complaint to negate an affirmative defense.

12

It was held in Cantor versus Detroit Edison,

I don't think that unlawful conduct under

13

the securities laws is entitled to more protection than

14

free speech or some of the conduct in these other cases;

15

16

standard as particularly inappropriate where an

affirmative defense is involved.

came down.

Court said that's their baby, we're going to stay out.

different.

patterned after the antitrust laws.

like the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. 15. the antitrust

The securities laws said we want to give the
We want to

The single damages point raised by the

So the answer to primary jurisdiction is that it's

always worked this way, that the private plaintiff is

19

supposed to sue in court.

20

under securities laws to sue in court, As he's expressly

empowered under the antitrust laws, and the courts have

issues can't be left in the hands of the SEC.

8

Congress put these issues in the hands of the SEC.

9

There are three separate provisions that give the SEC

The

Well,

10

power to define what is forbidden manipulation, what is

11

a forbidden tie-in, and what is excessive compensation.

12

The SEC this Court has said is an agency

13

that Congress had considerable confidence in in the

14

Gordon case and that confidence is well justified here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's your test,

Mr. Shapiro?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Our test is the one the Court

18

laid down in those two cases:

Is there active

19

supervision or is there pervasive regulation?

20

answer is yes to either of those, you ask, is there a

21

potential conflict, and if so immunity applies and the

22

complaint has to be dismissed.

23

you're talking about one IPO or an agreement that cuts

24

across several IPOs, because even in the multiple IPO

25

situation the jury would still have to decide, was that

If the

And this is true whether

a tie-in or was it something innocent; was it

2

unreasonable compensation or was it something that was

3

proper?

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

We all agree, say a group

5

of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that

6

every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30

7

percent more for 50 percent more shares next month.

8

Absolutely illegal, isn't it?

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

10
11

Well -

JUSTICE BREYER:

They write it down, just

what I said.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

The same circumstances were

13

presented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case.

14

They had a Three-week trial, 17 experts, and they

15

concluded that those charges were quite permissible

16

considering the whole range of services that were given.

17

Now, if this occurred with concerted action the SEC has

18

power to deal with concerted action.

19

they could deal with multiple party manipulations.

20

have many cases where they proceeded against multiple

21

parties.

22

Congress said that
They

In the NASD case the claim was that there

23

was a horizontal conspiracy involving many brokers and

24

many underwriters, it was industrywide, it went on for

25

years and years.

And the Government argued there it was
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

improper, it was contrary to the SEC's policies this.

2

This Court held squarely that that is within the SEC's

3

power to regulate and if something of that sort is

4

occurring the SEC can deal with it.

5

The test there wasn't whether it was

6

connected to something that was permissible.

7

was whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory

8

responsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort

9

of concerted action on an industrywide basis.

10

The test

Now, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct

11

has always been forbidden.

12

There are many case from this Court that we cite in our

13

reply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat

14

immunity because it's always possible to characterize

15

conduct in that fashion.

16

its expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change

17

its rules over time, which the SEC is now doing.

18

has to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes

19

up to the line of prohibition.

20

essential to protect investors and to protect issuers.

21

The markets couldn't function efficiently if

22

underwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of

23

conversations that get twisted in this litigation into

24

something characterized as tie-ins.

25

He labels it that way.

But the agency has to apply

And it

Here that conduct is

Now, there are 310 private suits now pending
57
Alderson Reporting Company

under the securities laws brought by many of these same

2

lawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to

3

manipulate the stock market.

4

a panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed,

5

including single damages, restrictions on class action

6

abuse, serious loss causation requirements.

7

Those suits are subject to

The only purpose for stretching the

8

antitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards

9

that Congress has passed, each and every one of them.

10

We think NASD and Gordon are very important in

11

preventing that kind of a pleading tactic.

12

And of course, when counsel talks about

13

concerted action and manipulating the stock market, what

14

did Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that?

15

There were extensive hearings about concerted

16

manipulation involving pools and groups that were

17

manipulating the market.

anti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give
