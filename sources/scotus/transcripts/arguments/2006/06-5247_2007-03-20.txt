CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler.

Mr. Haltom.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM

7

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HALTOM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The constitutional error that occurred in

11

Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can

12

result in a conviction of an innocent person.

13

Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in

14

Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of

15

that error or evaluated the effect of that error under

16

the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard.

17

Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is

18

entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple.

19

California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court

20

should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional

21

trial error that occurred in this case.

22

complied with this Court's precedent, that court would

23

have first identified the constitutional error that

24

occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and

25

second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

In the

Had that court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

effect of that error under the Chapman test.
The failure of that court to do so, the

3

unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated

4

Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings.

5

It scarcely seems reasonable -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7
8
9

I suppose he could have

come here on direct.
MR. HALTOM:

He could have, Your Honor,

however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come

10

following his appeal to the State appellate court, and

11

then after the denial of his petition, it would be a

12

discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he

13

no longer had the right to counsel.

14

And the fact of the matter is if he had

15

filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that,

16

it would have effectively been asking at that stage for

17

a type of error correction.

18

It scarcely seems logical that the scope of

19

the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the

20

constitutional violation that he suffered, that that

21

should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable

22

decision-making of the State appellate court in the -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if we're talking

24

about what -- where is the logic in the result that I

25

believe you're position produces, which is that a
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness

2

grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless,

3

obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the

4

error actually prejudiced him.

5

court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred

6

on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred,

7

whether there was any constitutional violation, then he

8

would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable

9

probability of harm.

Whereas if the State

10

Now, you know, why would there -- what does

11

he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in

12

an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous

13

determination that there was no violation?

14

there be a different standard of review between the two?

15

MR. HALTOM:

Why should

Justice Scalia, that's the

16

point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief

17

here.

18

there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit

19

truncated, by the State appellate court.

20

a Chapman analysis.

21

appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is

22

contrary to this Court's precedent.

23

it also would be an attack on -

24
25

And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that

But it was not

And that failure of the State

violation at all.

harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a

4

constitutional violation.

5

standard of review for one error and a different

6

standard of review for the other, regardless of whether

7

the State court conducted Chapman or not?

8
9

Its error is not with regard to the

MR. HALTOM:

Why should there be one

I don't know that necessarily

there has to be one standard of review for the other -

10

for one or the other, Your Honor.

Our position in this

11

case is simply following the logic of this Court's

12

decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or

13

any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the

14

State appellate court did.

15

is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred

16

in Mr. Fry's trial.

17

a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of

18

that error under the Chapman standard.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You cannot divorce -- there

Then that error is compounded when

You could say the same

20

thing when the State court has erroneously determined

21

that there was no violation.

22

In that case, you apply the Kotteakos

23

standard.

24

applying a higher standard to the other error.

25

I just don't understand the rationale of

MR. HALTOM:

Well 6

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the State court

2

didn't find that there was error.

3

court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it

4

in.

5

MR. HALTOM:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the State

That's correct.
It wasn't until we got

7

into the Federal court that there was an error found.

8

As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason

9

to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman

10

or not, because there was no error.

11

MR. HALTOM:

That's correct.

That's in

12

pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix.

13

appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter

14

of State law in this case.

15

that there was no constitutional error.

16

The State

The court also concluded

Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97

17

of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated

18

in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice

19

that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case.

20

However, in making that alternative holding, the State

21

appellate court, the California court, was applying

22

what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court

23

has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent

24

of the Kotteakos type standard.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it is that
7

1

determination that you are objecting to here.

2

harmlessness determination.

3

MR. HALTOM:

I am, Your Honor.

The

Obviously,

4

we are objecting to the State court's finding of no

5

underlying substantive constitutional violation, as well

6

as the State court's determination that there was no -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But for the former, you are

8

perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos.

9

the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman.

10

I just don't see the logic of that.

11

MR. HALTOM:

And for

Well, first of all, this case,

12

since it has now been determined in the Federal courts

13

that there was an underlying constitutional violation,

14

does not present that question.

15

understand the position that you are raising,

16

Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the

17

logic there.

18

that here.

19

We do -- and I

I don't think the Court has to resolve

Some of the lower Federal courts have

20

determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht

21

standard has been completely supplanted.

22

have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus

23

is Esparza to lead to that conclusion.

24

very well be the case.

25

needs to ultimately address that proposition in this

Some courts

And that may

However, I don't think the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

case.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As I read the

3

Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on

4

harmlessness is based on the structural consideration

5

that your under collateral review at that point, rather

6

than under direct review.

7

harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into

8

account the fact that it's collateral review rather than

9

direct.

10

MR. HALTOM:

You would apply a different

Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht,

12

can result in a more deferential standard of harmless

13

error inquiry.

14

this Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than

15

Chapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases.

The -- those considerations that led

16

However, a central theme of the Brecht

17

decision was that there have been Chapman analysis

18

conducted by the State appellate judiciary -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess that's

20

where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the

21

central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review,

22

and that calls for a different standard, or whether the

23

central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken,

24

and therefore, that calls for a different standard.

25

I'm not sure I agree with you that the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

latter is the case.

2

MR. HALTOM:

I agree that it could be -- it

3

is a debatable point.

4

circumstance that this Court stressed, I think

5

undoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that

6

State appellate review is to basically divorce the

7

holding in Brecht from the factual context in which that

8

case -- or out of which that case arose.

9

But the -- to ignore the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The dissenters certainly

10

thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in

11

Brecht.

12

the State court has found that "no violation has

13

occurred."

They said that Kotteakos would apply even where

14

MR. HALTOM:

That's true, Justice Scalia.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, never

16

approached the harmlessness thing.

17

dissenters thought.

MR. HALTOM:

That's what the

The dissenters thought that the

import of Brecht was that it was going to apply

10
Alderson Reporting Company

What I wonder, though, is why does the -

2

how does this case present the issue you want to argue?

3

I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that.

4

understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to

5

let this witness testify, it is cumulative.

6

And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a

7

mistake.

8

this witness added nothing.

9

prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that

As I

All right.

And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that
There could no possible

10

person.

That means it was cumulative, that means it did

11

nothing, and that was the appeals court.

12

court finds no error.

13

So the appeals

Now, we get over to the Federal court.

And

14

they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot.

15

couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the

16

point where the constitution is violated unless they

17

disagreed with that decision of making no possible

18

difference.

19

of case.

20

Very well.

Well, they

We disagree, send it back.

End

Now, where does it raise all this stuff

21

about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard

22

for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so

23

complicated.

24
25

How does this case raise it?

MR. HALTOM:

Well, I suppose, Your Honor,

because of the fact that the State appellate court
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at

2

that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised

3

the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner,

4

that there is no possible -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Was that as a reason for

6

there not being error?

Or was it in the context of

7

saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no

8

possible prejudice.

9

your opinion?

What does the footnote mean, in

The second?

10

MR. HALTOM:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Yes.
What is the footnote

number?

13

MR. HALTOM:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. HALTOM:

17

It's footnote 17.
Okay.

I'll read it.
Page what?

It's 97 in the Joint Appendix,

Your Honor.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

Thank you.

Very helpful.

20

The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well

21

get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a

22

decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression

23

on me.

24

different context, it's the same problem.

25

And he was a very good judge.

It's in a

He said, I originally thought this was the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could

2

conscientiously say, although I consider the findings

3

clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's

4

decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial

5

evidence.

6

from an agency.

7

And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes

But when I think about it, I don't think

8

there's substantial evidence either.

Okay.

In other

9

words, has there ever been a case in the history of

10

mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to

11

himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that

12

this is harmless, so I'll affirm.

13

it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll

14

reverse.

15

But I don't think

I mean, I find it very difficult to get

16

myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing

17

is possible.

18

MR. HALTOM:

I agree with you, Your Honor.

19

It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the

20

phrase here, and this case may be a case where the

21

difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of

22

consequence.

23

treatment of this case, at the district court level the

24

court stated:

25

If you'd look at the district court's

"Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating

Alderson Reporting Company

3

court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in

4

the district court.

5

The district court states:

"I cannot rule

So seemingly had that

Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the

6

dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice

7

even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the

8

panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the

9

prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples'

10

testimony been admitted that would have substantially

11

bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence.

12

statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is

13

harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not

14

inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying

15

the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in

16

Mr. Fry's -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That

If I could come back to,

18

may I ask this question:

Is part of your argument that

19

even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?

20

MR. HALTOM:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is a case, am I

22

correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then

23

a five-week deliberation in this case?

24

harmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen

25

a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?
14

And there was a

MR. HALTOM:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

Correct, Your Honor.
Where is that in the

question presented?

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It says that if the Brecht

5

standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear

6

the burden?

7

has the burden.

8
9

I guess that's the narrower question, who

MR. HALTOM:

Well, the Respondent has

essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear

10

the risk of non-persuasion.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But O'Neal, I thought

12

O'Neal just says that this word "burden of proof" is out

13

of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading

14

the record.

15

MR. HALTOM:

I think that that was what the

16

holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as

17

Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion,

18

the effect of that is to allocate the risk of

19

non-persuasion to the State.

20

that's -- I could be wrong, but it seems to me a

21

semantic point.

22

And so I think that

And to Justice Stevens' question, as you

23

pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos

24

standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an

25

exacting standard.

And in applying that standard, if
15

you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions,

2

Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the

5

Here we have a jury in the third trial that

question presented?

20

Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman.

Does it matter which harmless error
My answer to that is no, because

And this Court could in this case simply

22

decide this case on that very narrow question, like many

court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually

challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply,

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The trouble with reading

12

that second question that way is that, you know, it

13

follows from your first question, which speaks in the

14

generality of cases.

15

Your first question presented is, if constitutional

16

error in a State trial is not recognized by the

17

judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is

18

the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set

19

forth in Chapman or in Brecht?

20

question.

21

It's not speaking to this case.

That's the first

Very generalized.

to mean does it matter in this case which of the two.

what it means?

13

MR. HALTOM:

You think that's

I think that that is the import

of that portion of the question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that a question on

which we would be likely to grant cert?
MR. HALTOM:

Perhaps not if that was the

14

only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because,

15

as I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in

16

his concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard

17

is a demanding standard.

18

error in this case can be deemed harmless under any

19

standard, then what cannot?

you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury

where nine days into the deliberations at least five of

22

them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty.

MR. HALTOM:
Your Honor.

No, it certainly would not,

fashioning a decision which is faithful to the

requirement that -- or the principle that Kotteakos is

constitutional principle.

court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error

MR. HALTOM:

As I understand that question,

3

the Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of

its amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where

5

there's been an intervening change in the law which

6

could involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman.

7

And I've cited in my brief a district court case, United

8

States versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in

9

accordance with the position that I'm advocating, that

10

it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas

11

proceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without

12

regard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather

13

there's no need for deference, where the -- the big

14

issue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was

15

concerned about simply repeating a harmless error

16

analysis that the State court had already done; and

17

we're not asking this Court to do that in this case.

over in certain limited 2255 cases.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. MOODY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Federal habeas is limited in scope and

4

purpose.

It is not a continuation of the appellate

5

process.

Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited

6

by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State

7

sovereignty.

In Brecht, this court held that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said in your brief

that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's

going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should

have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's

conviction.

Did you say that?

7

MR. MOODY:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
But realistically, the

likelihood that such a petition would be successful,

10

passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to

11

have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would

12

grant cert on such a question is very slim.

13

MR. MOODY:

I agree, the likelihood of the

14

cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not

15

change the fact that once you come to court under 2254,

16

you are asking for collateral review.

review, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman

18

standard.

This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd

2

appreciate your commenting or straightening this out.

3

The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG

4

in the briefs.

5

let's look at this witness.

6

Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was

7

unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of

8

clearly established Federal law, because that testimony

9

of the witness that was excluded was not only material,

He states them very well.

The first is

The testimony was excluded.

10

it would have substantially bolstered the claim of

11

innocence.

12
13

So that's their finding on the merits.
Then they go on to say, but the exclusion

was harmless.

14

How could both those things be true?

How

15

could it be true that the reason that there was error in

16

excluding it was that the evidence is so important that

17

it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence?

18

That's one thing they say.

19

But the exclusion was harmless.

20

to understand how anyone could think both those things.

21

But maybe in the context of the case it was possible,

22

but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.

23

MR. MOODY:

I just fail

I think that the explanation is

24

as follows.

When you're analyzing the denial of a

25

defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first

what they were doing.

3

case.

And that is

You're not looking at the entire

You're looking only at the defense.

4

And so in the sense that something is better

5

than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven

6

may improve the defense case.

7

And yet nonetheless, when you move to the

8

next question, which is, was there a substantial and

9

injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now

10

you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking

11

at everything that was available to the jury -- it may

12

be that there was still so much other evidence that it

13

could overcome whatever increase you received on the

14

defense.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is it necessary for us

16

to try to reconcile those two statements?

17

Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there

18

was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for

19

purposes of the question that's presented to us.

20

shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question

21

independently of what they said about whether there was

22

a Chambers violation?

MR. MOODY:

We would not object to that.

one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and

we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine

21

whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this

was so close that there would have to be a finding of

MR. MOODY:

Well, but then at that

6

point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples'

7

testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation,

8

becomes more relevant.

9

MR. MOODY:

I would disagree, simply because

10

she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to

11

really give her testimony any true probative value in

12

the case because she was in and out of the room.

13

didn't hear the beginning.

14

And when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she

15

says, I don't know.

16

something very different -

She

She didn't hear the end.

So this could be -- this could be

MR. MOODY:

That's classic going to
That goes to the weight,

Ordinarily I would agree with

that.

And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking

about these killings, then certainly it would go to the

weight.

24

she said she didn't know if they were in California, New

25

But since he was speaking about killings that

therefore -- in California we ask that before you

present third party culpability evidence you tie it to

3

this crime.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So we don't assume that

he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?

6

MR. MOODY:

Well, it's -- he may have

7

committed other killings, but if did not confess to

8

committing these killings then there's no probative

value to her testimony.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think the

11

question of the application of Brecht is included within

12

the questions presented?

13

MR. MOODY:

No.

I briefed it because I was

14

concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't

15

think it is fairly presented.

16

The only other point that I wanted to make

17

is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will

18

basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a

19

near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral

20

review.

21

times Petitioners come to court and they have a case

22

where there was no finding of constitutional error in

23

State court and therefore no Chapman application, but

24

they're going to assert that in Federal court.

25

if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then

As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many

40
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

you really have reduced application of Brecht.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But on the other side,

3

State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother

4

in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into

5

the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.

6

MR. MOODY:

I don't think we should assume

7

that the State courts are going to do that.

I think

8

that what -- it's sort of like what we said earlier in

9

the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary

10

ruling is a constitutional violation.

I would say most

11

of them are not.

12

line of exactly where that is.

13

is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best.

14

so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a

15

Chapman standard because it would not be finding error.

And this Court has not drawn a bright

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The distinction between collateral review
and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review

2

for harmlessness in collateral review become the same

standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct

5

That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this

6

Court.

7

They didn't cite it here.

He got Chapman review.

They cited Chapman.

That's the only difference.

8

Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they

9

unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it

10

again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a

11

deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral

12

review and direct review and that distinction turns upon

13

the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not

14

to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a

MS. MILLETT:

The tie would go to the

8

prisoner, yes.

Were it in equipoise, because the State

9

would have the burden the State would lose.

I don't

10

think that's what happened in this case.

I think what

11

Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the

12

way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is

13

that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court

14

and what the judge will say in, what the court said in

15

O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially

16

contributed to the jury's verdict?

17

essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very

18

bottom when it said "The court doesn't find that there's

19

an insufficient showing" -- that's the same way of

20

saying I haven't been persuaded -- that the error

contributed to the verdict.

that requires not just looking at what, in isolation,

MS. MILLETT:

The jury takes five

And

If it's a

close question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht

mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State

there's no possible prejudice.

prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment

not find that a reasonable conclusion.

MS. MILLETT:

Well, a Respondent is entitled

to defend on any ground supported by the record.

15

even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that

16

there was an error and one assumes that it was -- which

17

is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly

unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call

19

that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing

this, and the combination of lack of foundation and

that rises to the level of unconstitutionality.

9

this is not filling in the gaps in direct review.

10

We're

not going to give you -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no evidence

12

or inference that it was close on the alternative

13

murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples'

14

testimony goes to.

15

MS. MILLETT:

That's exactly right.

In

16

fact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz

17

has a couple of references in a two-day closing

18

argument.

19

That was not the centerpiece of his case.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

It has to be close on an

20

alternative murderer.

21

he didn't do it, somebody else did.

22

case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the

23

second.

24
25

It wasn't suicide.

MS. MILLETT:

So if it's a close

No, but as to who did it and

whether Hurtz did it or whether -- remember, what the

2

this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or

3

someone else is what we don't know.

4

Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before

5

this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of

6

a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court

7

has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were

8

involved, was so -- that simply disallowed the twelfth

10

clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the

There's nothing close

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but we don't know

what they would have done if they had this evidence that

was excluded.

23

MS. MILLETT:

One never knows that in habeas

corpus.

But what you do when you look at what they were

focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics

experts.

They had them read back right next each other.

2

They made that call.

3

It's their job to do it.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the reason they may

4

have been doing that is that they may very well have

5

thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt

6

was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to

7

know was whether the evidence going specifically to this

8

defendant was strong enough to overcome it.

9

MS. MILLETT:

May I answer?

One would have

10

expected at least one readback on third party

11

culpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's
