CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

Mr. Kellogg.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. KELLOGG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

I think the most important point that I

11

can make today is that this is a case about the

12

substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just

13

as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court

14

articulated the substantive requirements for pleading

15

a claim under the securities law, and just as in

16

Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated

17

General Contractors, in Trinko.

18

case, the Court is faced with the question of what a

19

plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim

20

and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust

21

laws.

22

And in the instant

In that regard, I'd like to direct the

23

Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's

24

complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the

25

joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract

2

combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.

3

complaint states, and I quote, "in the absence of any

4

meaningful competition among the defendants," and,

5

quote, in light of the parallel course of conduct

6

that each engaged in to prevent competition, the

7

plaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The

Well, but isn't the next

sentence, the substance of the sentence is

10

"plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that

11

defendants have entered into a contract combination

12

or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their

13

respective telephone and/or high speed interstate

14

markets, and agreed not to compete with one another

15

and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one

16

another."

17

Sherman Act?

Now, does that state a violation of the

18

MR. KELLOGG:

It does not, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. KELLOGG:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It does not?

It does not state a claim.
I mean, you could leave

22

out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted,

23

that's not part of the declaration in the sentence.

24

But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of

25

the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. KELLOGG:

The sentence recites the

2

language of the Sherman Act, that is correct.

3

what this Court's cases indicate and what Rule 8

4

requires -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

It's got the language of

6

the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive

7

entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed

8

markets.

9

description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.

10

That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a

MR. KELLOGG:

It is true that they have

11

described the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura,

12

Associated General Contractors, and other cases of

13

this Court require is a statement of facts that

14

warrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs

15

wish to -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kellogg, the

17

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid

18

using the word fact throughout.

19

has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead

20

facts.

21

shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is,

22

and you're not required to plead facts.

23

that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust

24

of your argument.

25

And from 1938 on, it

The index of forms, the appendix of forms

MR. KELLOGG:

And yet

Your Honor, every case of
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court dealing with pleading standards has

2

indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite

3

a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to

4

relief therefore.

5

plaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss

6

causation, and the Court said -

7

In Dura, for example, the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Mr. Kellogg, that's

8

not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact

9

that there was an agreement to prevent competitive

10

entry into respective markets.

11

antitrust complaints that are no more specific than

12

that.

13

MR. KELLOGG:

There are dozens of

Your Honor, in the context

14

in which this claim is made, the allegation of

15

agreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact.

16

It is an inference that the plaintiffs seek to draw

17

from the facts that they allege in the complaint.

18

Context here is everything.

19

Justice Ginsburg, or in the case of Sherkovitz, you

20

had a specific context.

21

individual participants named, a clear injury in form

23

In form 9, for example,

You had a time, a place,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light.

Doesn't say whether it was speeding.
6

It doesn't say

2

MR. KELLOGG:

That is correct, Justice

3

O'Connor, but you have a direct context -- Justice

4

Ginsburg, you had a direct context in which an

5

eyewitness participant in the event is claiming

6

negligence on behalf of the driver of the car.

7

the instant case, we have no injury that's separate

8

from the alleged conspiracy, and we have no time,

place or participants for the alleged conspirators.

I do not think so, because I

don't think -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

complaint does just what I said in the field of

3

MR. KELLOGG:

I would cite, for example,

4

the Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the

5

plaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a

6

minimally adequate education.

7

factual statement.

8

in that case is that we do not have to accept legal

9

conclusions in the guise of factual allegations.

10

That sounds like a

But what the Court expressly said

But of course, there the

looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you

read Dura.

20

MR. KELLOGG:

I think Dura is an exact

21

analogy.

In Dura, they allege proximate cause, they

22

allege loss causation.

23

let's look at their statement of facts, which only

24

showed that they had bought at an inflated price.

25

And the Court said there was a fatal gap between that

wished to draw.

You can get into trouble

by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege

a lot, you might leave something out.

missing there are some facts.

saying a complaint has to have facts?

MR. KELLOGG:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

So now you're

Absolutely.
Well, I thought you were

22

also making a different argument.

I thought you were

23

making the argument that they have, by their

24

pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that

they don't have enough facts to support a general

allegation.

of the preface that you began reading, that in view

simply of the fact that they are not competing, and

in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the

Act.

6

I thought you were saying that because

So I guess my question is, would your

7

position be different if there were no allegation

8

simply of an absence of competition and parallel

9

action if -- would your position be different if they

10

had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized,

11

that here were these parties and they had -- they had

12

taken some action, not specified, which resulted in

violation of the Act?

Our position would not be

But as you point out, in this case -

enough, but are you saying that this is worse

specification.

24

made affirmatively show that they don't have enough

25

for the agreement.

And the specifications that they have

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KELLOGG:

It is certainly true that

2

all they have alleged is conduct from which they seek

3

to draw an inference of conspiracy.

4

made that quite clear, that they have made no direct

5

allegation.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And they have

And you're saying that

7

inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts

8

that they have alleged.

9

MR. KELLOGG:

That is correct.

Our

10

position is that as a matter of substantive antitrust

11

law, what this Court said in Matsushita is that

12

antitrust law limits the range of permissible

13

inferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct.

14

And if all you have is parallel conduct that's

15

consistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on

16

the other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you

17

cannot draw an inference of the sort that the

18

plaintiffs depend upon in this case.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, that may be

20

true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on

21

the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation

22

that the defendants have agreed not to compete with

23

one another is not a statement of fact?

24

MR. KELLOGG:

I am.

I would say that

25

that's a -- that's a conclusion 11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, what if they said

2

they agreed in writing not to compete with one

another, would that be sufficient?

If there were a specific

that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?

11

MR. KELLOGG:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

the words orally out?

14

allegation of fact?

15

Or if they have

MR. KELLOGG:

Yes.

Because you require Then why did you leave

Why is it not a statement,

Because the plaintiffs here

16

were very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make

17

any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest

18

that there was a time and place -

19
20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's a direct

allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.
MR. KELLOGG:

But they make it clear in

22

that paragraph that it's an inference.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They make it fairly

24

clear that they may only have the evidence of

25

parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a

2

summary judgment.

3

allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.

4

But how you can say this is not an

MR. KELLOGG:

I'm saying that it's not

5

sufficient to state a claim.

6

that there was lost causation in Dura, or that there

7

was harm to the union in Associated General

8

Contractors or there, that there was harm -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just as the allegation

Now you're, that's the

10

part precisely which you're following that I don't,

11

that I actually don't know, is the extent to which

12

you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of

13

law, you can allege a fact.

Or you say, they treated

19

and there is just no notion that you have a what and

20

when, how, under what circumstances.

21

totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't

22

know what, what period of time he is supposed to be

23

thinking about, what, what happens to such a

complaint?

14

they're using the fact that there was parallel

behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than

MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

The fundamental concern of the United

States is that the decision of the Second Circuit can

alleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the

bare assertion of an agreement.

portions of the decision that talk about a

20

you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only

interpretation I can draw from that passage.

22

Court held that if you allege parallel action unless

Well, is that really what

2

they -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I

3

thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of

4

facts, only on the assumption that there had been a

5

pleading which did raise a plausible, possible

6

inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the

7

Court was saying if the, if the plausibility

8

criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that

9

the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that

there is no set of facts which would actually support

the action.

And I'm not sure that that can be done

But I thought the Court did not get to

Am I about that?

MR. BARNETT:

Well, Justice Souter, I read

20

that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not

21

expressly referencing the plausibility requirement.

22

There is language saying that the allegation needs to

23

be plausible but when you get to this specific

24

passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a

25

court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no set of facts that could be proved.

2

regardless, even if I am, your interpretation is

3

potentially permissible interpretation, the

4

fundamental concern of the United States is that this

5

Court, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1

6

Sherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a

7

motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond

8

mere generic parallel action.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

So, so that if

10

plausibility is the standard this does not meet the

11

standard of plausibility, that's your argument?

12

MR. BARNETT:

Well, we prefer the

13

formulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura

14

that says that the facts need to demonstrate some

15

reasonably founded expectation that there is an

16

unlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of

17

the Sherman Act.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And some parallel action

19

would indicate that wouldn't it?

20

example they, you have nine companies that change

21

their price at the same hour of the same day, 10

22

months in a row.

MR. BARNETT:

I mean, if for

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

I agree.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're, you're not
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying that parallel action can never create this,

2

this kind of -

3

MR. BARNETT:

That is correct.

If all you

4

know is that there is parallel action or inaction,

5

that in and of itself tells you nothing.

6

start to add the facts and circumstances surrounding

7

it, particular parallel action can be suspicious

8

enough, and the example you give is a good one, that

9

demonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for

Once you

10

believing that discovery may yield evidence showing

11

that that parallel price increase at the same time by

12

nine different companies was the result of an

13

unlawful conspiracy.

14

If I can turn to, in -- in deciding

15

whether or not there is such a reasonably founded

16

expectation, you do need to look to the substantive

17

law.

18

Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

19

I think I've heard go to this issue.

20

specifically limits the kinds of facts that can be

21

used to establish an agreement that is cognizable

under the Sherman Act.

some economists might argue is a form of an

25

agreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of

that they've agreed not to compete with one another

There are four essential dimensions to the

problem that's before the Court and on every one of

those dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor

negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile,

But we're trying to get this

I care about what the right answer

Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?
MR. RICHARDS:

There's a big difference

between -- the answer is I don't know, perhaps.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. RICHARDS:

Perhaps?
Perhaps.

But that's very

12

different from this case and it's different in that

13

an automobile accident is something that happens all

14

in one moment in time.

15

the conspiracy alleged -

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

The agreement happens at

MR. RICHARDS:

Oh, it could happen in many

moments.

22

Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.

23

I used to each Contracts.

MR. RICHARDS:

But what the Second Circuit

24

said on this point, and I submit that the Second

25

Circuit was correct, was that the complaint does set
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

forth the temporal and geographic parameters of the

2

alleged illegal activity and the identities of the

3

alleged key participants, and I think that's correct.

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But where does it

set forth agreement?

6

MR. RICHARDS:

It alleges -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Temporal,

8

geographic, the identities, but where does it set

9

forth anything evincing an agreement other than the

10
11

allegation of parallel conduct?
MR. RICHARDS:

It alleges that there was

12

an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an

13

agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a

14

plaintiff's burden in the complaint.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have any,

16

is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the

17

parallel conduct?

18

MR. RICHARDS:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

Yes.
And what does that

consist of?
MR. RICHARDS:

The leading plus factor

22

that's generally used in, in the Matsushita context,

23

in the Monsanto context, is action that would have

24

been against the self-interest of the conspirators in

25

the absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

alleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering

2

into one another's territories and competing among

3

the ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have

4

been -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it states -

6

would it state an antitrust violation if had you a

7

grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet

8

store on the other corner of the block and you say,

9

well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies

10

and they could make money if they did, therefore

11

that's an antitrust violation?

12

MR. RICHARDS:

If that conspiracy were

13

implausible, if it made no sense.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

That's all the

facts that are alleged.
MR. RICHARDS:

Right, but the Second

17

Circuit standard and the standard we defend is that

18

if someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no

19

sense because it's obvious from the face of the

20

complaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the

21

same product market, not in the same geographic

22

market or something of that kind, there is no

23

conceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of

24

conspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

If my case, the gasoline,
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four

2

gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations,

3

and they didn't cut their prices.

4

MR. RICHARDS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Complaint?

Yes.
Well, then that's the

6

economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this

7

economy.

8

engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism,

9

and I know there are economists who think that that

Every firm in a concentrated industry

10

should be the case, but I thought the law to date was

11

that the Department of Justice is not given by the

12

Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire

13

American economy.

14

it is.

15

But if we accept your view I guess

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, Justice Breyer, in

16

the NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which

17

is one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon

18

for a circuit conflict to get here, what the court

19

said is that allegations that defendant's action

20

taken independently would be contrary to their

21

economic self-interest will ordinarily tend to

22

exclude the likelihood -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ordinarily, if you take

24

that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a

25

consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Act section 2, then we have that radical change that

2

many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that

3

half the economy is in violation, because in any

4

concentrated industry, after all, it is in the

5

interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large

6

market unless he knows his three competitors will

7

also keep prices up.

8

you'd cut them.

9

parallelism.

Now, you have to know that or

And that's called conscious

And I had always thought that this

10

Court had not said that that in and of itself is a

11

violation of the Sherman Act.

12

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, Justice Breyer, we

13

don't just allege conscious parallelism.

14

allege -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

We

I know that, but if in

16

fact all you have to do in order to bring a

17

price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege

18

conscious parallelism and then add without further

19

foundation, and we think there was a real agreement

20

too, but there's nothing other than the conscious

21

parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I

said, with the exception you might not win at the end

23

of the day.

What have you is a ticket to conduct
Now, that's what's bothering the

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

answer to that problem.

2

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, Justice Breyer, the

3

difference between that, a critical difference

4

between that scenario and what we have alleged in

5

this complaint is that we do allege in great detail

6

that not entering into one another's territories

7

would have been contrary to the interests of -

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that does not help

you with respect to the other claim, the claim that

10

there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors

11

from coming in.

12

understand it alleged there, and I also understand

13

that it would have been entirely in the interest of

14

each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and

15

that there is no need for them to agree to do that.

16

It would be the most natural thing in the world to do

17

it.

18

There's no plus factor as I

What do you say about that part of your case?
MR. RICHARDS:

As to that aspect of the

19

case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but

20

they are essentially allegations of common motive,

21

which is a less strong, I'll grant you -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but a common, isn't

23

the common motive consistent, just as consistent with

24

no agreement as with agreement?

25

didn't have to agree; their common motive was

In other words, they

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

operative agreement or not?
MR. RICHARDS:

The important thing as to

3

that aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case

4

in this Court, which said that you're not supposed to

5

dismember -- it's an inappropriate way to approach a

6

conspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it

7

in isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself

8

and then wipe the slate clean at the end of that

9

analysis, and that's essentially what the other side

10
11

is trying to do repeatedly.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, what the other side

12

is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when

13

it would be in the interest of each of the alleged

14

conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing

15

in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged

16

something that gets to the threshold of plausibility.

17

That's their argument and I, I -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think, by the way, that

19

that argument applies not just to the keeping out the

20

upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other

21

alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you

22

want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter

23

your field I know that you're going to enter mine.

24

It just doesn't pay for me to do it.

25

make money, but I'll lose money.

Yeah, I can

It seems to me

35
Alderson Reporting Company

perfectly natural for companies that have a certain

2

geographic area in which they are the, the principal,

3

the selected instrument and although they technically

4

can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know

5

that if they do it they will be subjected to the same

6

thing.

7

parallelism.

8
9

That is nothing more than conscious

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You may reply to us

jointly or severally, however you may want.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. RICHARDS:

If I may, I'll try to pose

12

a hypothetical that I think addresses Justice

13

Souter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try

14

to address your question.

15

example would be suppose one alleges a conspiracy to

16

rob a bank and to steal a number of getaway cars at

17

the same time and one comes -- in order to get away,

18

so that the conspirators couldn't be found at the

19

site of robbing the bank.

20

there's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally

21

independent of the bank and without a conspiracy.

22

Why do they need a conspiracy to steal a car?

23

isn't that something that they wouldn't individually

24

do?

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Justice Souter, a good

One could say, well,

But the difference
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Why

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between that case and this is that the allegation

2

with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway

3

cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not

4

present here.

5

conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in.

6

And at that general level the answer is, of course

7

anyone in his right mind would want to make it

8

difficult to let the upstarts in.

9

assume that they might have agreed on some matter of

Here the allegation simply is parallel

There's no need to

10

detail which is not essential to the scheme.

11

a general characteristic of competition and

12

resistance of competition.

13

MR. RICHARDS:

This is

I understand, but the point

14

I'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what

15

one does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to

16

keep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary

17

aspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and

18

analyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway

19

car theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well,

20

they have a reason individually to steal the cars, so

21

I guess that couldn't -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't understand

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

you.

MR. RICHARDS:

I understand that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. RICHARDS:

Conduct contrary to

JUDGE STEVENS:

Do you agree you must -

do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement

MR. RICHARDS:

There must be an inference

of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn

from circumstantial evidence, and that's what

Matsushita is all about.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then when we

statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that

plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that

they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion

17

based upon your prior allegations, it's not an

independent allegation of an agreement.

because of this parallel conduct, because we think

20

it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they

have agreed.

It's not a

statement that independently there apart from all of

this, there's an agreement.

there is agreement.

for what they did.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if they don't do

4

that, is it your argument that simply by behaving

5

differently from the way Congress assumed when it

6

passed the statute, that raises the plausible

7

inference of violation?

8
9

MR. RICHARDS:

Within the other facts that

I was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here

10

that competition as a CLEC would have been, in the

11

absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege

12

here, would have been a profitable endeavor.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But is part of the

14

plausibility of that inference the fact, in your

15

argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would

16

happen?

MR. RICHARDS:

That's one factor that I

point to among several to JUSTICE SOUTER:

congressional assumption is part of your case, in

other words?

MR. RICHARDS:

It is.
Yes.
I believe that along with

other factors such as the constant complaints to

Congress about how CLECs had the better side of the

2

deal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the

do.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I used to work in the

6

field of telecommunications and if the criterion is

7

that happens which Congress expected to happen when

8

it passed its law, your case is very weak.

9

MR. RICHARDS:

Well, Your Honor, that -- I

10

certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that

11

we would be relying on at trial or at summary

12

judgment to support our case, but in our motion to

13

dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support

14

our case.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you need what is

16

called the plus factor, and I gather that you

17

acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this,

18

this parallel action seemed to be against the self

19

interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus

20

factor and you would lose.

MR. RICHARDS:

I don't think that the

22

Court, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own

23

that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it

24

would have been in their interest to do this in the

that might be a different consideration.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Richards, didn't

12

the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor?

13

They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs

could show it, but the second sentence is you don't

15

need a plus factor.

16

MR. RICHARDS:

That's correct.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that can be wrong

18

or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that

19

Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL KELLOGG,

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

13

MR. KELLOGG:

Thank you.

Your Honor.

14

I have three quick points that I would

15

like to make.

First following up on Justice

16

Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have

17

an authority to issue purely investigative

18

complaints.

19

issue civil investigative demands, but for private

20

plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery,

21

particularly to the sort of massive discovery at

22

issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking

23

the plaintiff -- the defendants have done something

24

wrong.

25

plaintiffs there specifically alleged that the

The Department of Justice of course can

In that regard, in the Trinko case, the

56

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendants were engaged in actions against self

2

interest by not cooperating with new entrants.

3

what the Court did is it went behind that mere

4

allegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts

5

concerning the industry, looked at the statute,

6

regulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous.

7

course it is in the self interest of the incumbents

8

to not go out of their way to cooperate with new

9

entrants to allow them to take business away.

10

And

Of

Now the flip side, the second half of the

11

conspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our

12

failure to enter new markets.

13

recognize that they are suggesting we should have

14

relied upon a regulatory regime that we were

15

successfully challenging in the courts.

16

struck down three separate times, and it was simply

17

not a viable business opportunity in light of those

18

facts and there is no reason to suggest that it was

19

anything but in the self interest of the defendants

20

to decline to enter these markets.

21

parallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under

22

the antitrust laws.

23

have here, and as a consequence they failed to state

24

a claim.

25

And it's important to

We got it

Even conscious

And at best, that is what we
