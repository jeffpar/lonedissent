CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. HOWLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court.

12

These are tax enforcement lawsuits.

If

13

jurisdiction existed, the only issue a court would

14

decide is whether a tax is owed.

15

not fall within any real property exception to sovereign

16

immunity before Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign

17

Immunities Act and Section 1605(a)(4) of that act did

18

not create a new exception where none had otherwise

19

existed.

20

This type of case did

Congress chose JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course you could say the

21

same thing if the mission here sold its property to

22

someone and someone was claiming the right to possess

23

the property by reason of the sale.

24

up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the,

25

the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

And you could come

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HOWLEY:

Uh -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it would clearly come

3

within the property right exception, wouldn't it?

You

4

-- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction

5

that created the, the right in real property assuming

6

the right in real property exists.

7

MR. HOWLEY:

Actually, Justice Scalia, I

8

believe that if you had a dispute over what happened

9

with the sale of property that it would fall within the

10

based upon commercial activities exception in

11

1605(a)(2).

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's assume that, let's

13

assume that exception didn't exist.

14

MR. HOWLEY:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.
And you had nothing but the

16

real estate exception.

17

ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but

18

whether there was a proper contract or not.

19

frankly we wouldn't accept that.

20

MR. HOWLEY:

You would come in and say this

No.

And I -

And I think that's a very

21

different case from what we have here because in that

22

case the issue for the Court to decide is which of the

23

parties has the right, has the title in the real

24

property.

25

York does not seek title in this property.

That is not in issue here.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

The City of New
Their action

Official - Subject to Final Review

is to declare the validity of a tax lien and the issue

2

in an action to declare the validity of a tax lien is

3

whether the tax is owed and whether it has been paid.

4

That is the issue that's presented to the Court.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what New York is

6

seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest

7

in the land.

8
9

It runs with the land, doesn't it?

MR. HOWLEY:

I -- I -- yes.

I acknowledge

that there are some similarities between a lien and a

10

right in property.

12

numerous and far more significant.

13

property a lien does not give the lien holder any right

14

to own, access, possess, cross over, collect rents from,

15

17

For example, that it runs with the

But there are dissimilarities that are far more

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unlike rights and

Can't he force a sale of

the property to collect the lien?

18

MR. HOWLEY:

This action does not.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that this

20

action does not because of the sovereign immunity.

21

-- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien

22

is.

23

sale of the property so that he can get out the money

24

represented by his lien?

25

But

In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes.

If the lien holder

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

commences an action to foreclose on the property, then a

2

consequence of that could be the sale of the property.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, how can he commence

4

an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any

5

ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the

6

property?

7

MR. HOWLEY:

I do not dispute that a lien

8

holder has an interest, a security interest in the

9

property.

But Congress did not write in Section

10

1605(a)(4) all interests that are in issue in property.

11

Congress in fact had the European Convention in front of

12

it which said rights, interests and obligations in

13

property.

14

Convention elsewhere but did not choose that language

15

here.

16

Congress chose language from the European

Congress said only rights in property.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're distinguishing

17

between rights in property and interests in property?

18

would think that every right in property is an interest

19

in property and vice versa.

20

MR. HOWLEY:

No.

I do not believe so,

21

Justice Scalia.

There -- there -- there has to be a

22

reason why Congress chose language verbatim from the

23

European Convention in other sections of the statute

24

such as the counterclaim exception, but in this

25

exception said we are not taking interest and
6
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obligations from the European Convention, we are only

2

saying rights.

3

And this Court -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The counterclaim sounds

4

to me very much like it comes straight out of the

5

Federal Rules, not out of any convention.

6

transaction and occurrence, right?

7

MR. HOWLEY:

8

Yes.

The, the

counterclaim exception -

9
10

Yes.

It's the same

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's exactly what

it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory -

11

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes, but Congress said, in the

12

House report Congress refers to the European Convention

13

as the source for the counterclaim exception in the

14

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so Congress said we are

15

taking this from the European Convention.

16

language also -

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:
it.

Congress didn't really say

I mean the committee said it to be precise.

19
20

This -- this

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes, that's absolutely correct,

Justice.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Good.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

What was your distinction

23

between a mortgage and a tax lien?

24

MR. HOWLEY:

25

I don't think there is a

distinguished, a distinction between a mortgage and a
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tax lien.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, so think they can't

3

enforce mortgage under this?

4

can't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?

5

MR. HOWLEY:

That is to say the bank

No.

But Congress, Congress

6

passed another exception here, 1605(a)(2) that said

7

actions based upon commercial activity provide an

8

exception to sovereign immunity and these exceptions

9

have to be read together.

10

They have to be read -

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's, that's where it's

11

hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell

12

the real estate.

13

is secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an

14

interest in property, I think.

15

there any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest

16

in property?

17

Ordinary secured interest in mortgage

MR. HOWLEY:

I mean is there, is

Well, actually there is.

In

18

the, in -- when the United States waived immunity from

19

suit concerning real property it limited its waivers to

20

liens and mortgages and not rights in property.

21

there has been distinctions made between mortgage liens

22

and liens on the one hand and rights in property on the

23

other.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so

Well, on that point in

some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that

2

tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that

3

they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as

4

opposed to an attachment.

5

Is it not true?

And I don't, and I'm not

6

talking just about order of priority for creditors.

7

talking about the superiority insofar as being or not

8

being an interest in property.

9
10

MR. HOWLEY:

Well, yes.

I'm

It is superior to

other types of liens.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes.

It is an interest, a security

13

interest in the property, but it is not a right in the

14

estate of the property, and it doesn't give any type of

15

the possession and ownership rights that every other

16

right in property gives.

17
18
19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there New York law to

that effect?
MR. HOWLEY:

Yes, there is.

And we have

20

cited it in our brief.

The Respondent has attempted to

21

distinguish it, because a Court of Claims jurisdictional

22

act was passed that deemed a lien an interest in

23

property for purposes of jurisdiction in the New York

24

Court of Claims but the essential nature of a lien is

25

not, under New York law, a right in the estate.

Because I had -- I had

thought that it is an estate in land in at least some

There are different kinds of

There appears to be in

law or Federal law?

This is a question of Federal

This Court has held -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So even if you have

15

different rules in different States, there is going to

the meaning that the restrictive theory of sovereign

immunity required at the time in 1976.

3

court here in the United States or anywhere in the world

4

had held that sovereign immunity was abrogated merely by

5

having a statutory lien on the property.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And in 1976, no

Had the State Department

7

taken a position at that point, at the time the Act was

8

passed?

9

MR. HOWLEY:

There is -- not to my

10

knowledge.

11

the House report, general language about 1605(a)(4)

12

relating to real property disputes, but there is not

13

precise language about whether liens are or liens are

14

not -

15

There is vague language in the testimony in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was nothing vague

16

about the State Department's brief in the Englewood

17

case.

18

MR. HOWLEY:

No, there is not, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

20

the Englewood Court relied on a D.C. Circuit decision.

21

And I believe that the Solicitor General will say that

22

they have reconsidered their position, they have

23

reconsidered Article 29 of the European Convention,

24

which they relied on heavily in the Englewood brief.

25

But they lost in Englewood.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They lost and

But anyway, at a time

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department

2

was taking the position that a lien was an interest in

3

land.

4
5

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes, that is correct.

But they

have since decided that that position was wrong.

be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were

JUSTICE SCALIA:
of the conceivable, is it?

11
12

That's not beyond the realm

MR. HOWLEY:

It's not beyond the realm of

the conceivable.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I take it there has

14

never been a case in the history of the world you'll

15

tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned

16

money to build an embassy has ever brought a case

17

against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won

18

under anything like this exception, because they can't

19

sue them.

20
21
22
23

MR. HOWLEY:

Not that we're aware of, and

not that we've seen JUSTICE BREYER:

Ever.

And there is none

the other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.

24

MR. HOWLEY:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

So why do people

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lend money to build embassies?

2

MR. HOWLEY:

Well, because once you lend

3

money and you engage in commercial activity, if the

4

claim is based upon the commercial activity, Congress

5

had provided a separate section, 1605(a)(2) that

6

protects the American citizen who has lent money to an

7

embassy.

8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And how did it work before

1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th
century, embassies, if you know.

11

MR. HOWLEY:

I don't know about 19th century

12

embassies.

13

predates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there has

14

been a commercial activity exception here in the United

15

States.

16

I do know that since the Tate letter, which

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't buying land that

17

you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the

18

residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying

19

that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes

20

on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?

21

MR. HOWLEY:

Well, this Court held in Saudi

22

Arabia against Nelson that it's not just engaged in,

23

related to commercial activity, but the cause of action,

24

the claim has to be based upon commercial activity.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the Indian embassy could

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

own real estate throughout New York City, which it

2

wouldn't have to pay taxes on?

3

could be done about it?

4

MR. HOWLEY:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Why?

No.

You're saying,

you're saying it's not a commercial activity.

8
9

It depends on the use they put

that property to.

6
7

Or if it didn't, nothing

MR. HOWLEY:

I mean -

The mere ownership of the land

is not JUSTICE SCALIA:

It depends upon the use,

11

and the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy

14
15

MR. HOWLEY:

As long as it's not commercial

activity, it would not be taxed and -

16

17

occupying of it is commercial activity.

18

I mean, they

MR. HOWLEY:

But the buying and

Well, the buying of it, if the

19

claim is based upon the buying of the property, under

20

Saudi Arabia against Nelson, then the commercial

21

activities exception would apply.

22

ownership of the property is not commercial activity.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the mere

activity for New York to say, we provide garbage

services, electric services, et cetera.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. HOWLEY:

Well, separate and apart from

2

the jurisdictional issue, the Vienna Conventions do say

3

that if there are fees for services provided, such as

4

garbage collection, water, those types of services, then

5

there is no immunity from the fees for those services.

6

And those fees should be paid.

7

whether that's commercial activity, it may be.

as water, or a private entity provides a service such as

transformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and

8

recharacterizing the case as one to determine the

9

validity of the lien.

10

And I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice

11

Ginsburg, on the question you just asked, because I

12

think it's very important to emphasize that under

13

Respondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the

14

potential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in

15

the FSIA in the following sense:

16

doesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the

17

debt that's secured by the lien.

Respondent's theory

18

So under Respondent's view, the fact that

19

this case involves a debt that arises out of property

20

taxes is largely beside the point.

21

weight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed

22

effects of the lien on the property.

23

example, you could have a case in which a commercial

24

activity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues

25

a foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that the

What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm

looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case,

which you argued that these liens were interests in

property.

14

Are those arguments no longer valid?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, we, of course,

reviewed our position in that case, and we have come to

the conclusion that it was incorrect.

those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.

All of

Well, let me try to take up

First with respect to the

10

question of whether holders of a lien are entitled to

11

compensation in eminent domain, we don't take issue with

12

the proposition that a lien is property.

13

property, but the question under the statute is whether

14

a lien confers a right in the underlying immovable

15

property.

16

just be that just compensation is owed to a lien holder

17

because to the extent that the eminent domain proceeding

18

takes that lien there's compensation owed for that

19

property.

disappears the lien disappears.

You know, if it's blown

MR. SRINIVASAN:

the property goes the lien follows it.

6

that that's not an interest in the property?

7

Well, I think :

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But otherwise wherever
How can you say

Well, I don't think it's a

8

right in property, Justice Scalia.

The lien is a

9

species of property, of intangible personal property, in

10

the same sense that a cause of action would be, because

11

after all what a lien is is essentially at bottom a

12

claim.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how can the,

14

how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin

15

waste of the immovable property?

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, a lien holder can

17

bring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to

18

understand what interest the lien holder is protecting

19

in that situation.

20

is to protect the security interest.

21

from an action for waste by someone who holds a right in

22

the property.

23

this because New York I think has two species of waste

24

actions, one brought by a security interest holder and

25

one brought by the holder of property rights.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

clouded by this lien.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think liens

14

generally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that

15

something's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in

the property.

17

And I could give you one other example.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't have to be a

18

right in the property.

If you look at it from the

19

owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's

20

title in the property.

21

Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the

22

lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner.

23

And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in

which rights in immovable property are an issue, and

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think our arguments apply

3

equally both to the lien holder and to the property

4

owner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with

5

respect to both of them a lien -- the lien doesn't

6

affect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right

7

to exclude others, which this Court has characterized as

8

the most fundamental of property rights.

9

affect the right to receive income from the property.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't

It affects the right to

11

convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous

12

right that goes along with the real estate.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it has a practical

14

consequence on conveyance because it, as Justice

15

Ginsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title.

16

are other instruments that result in a cloud on title

17

but that wouldn't be considered rights in property.

18

example would be a contract, a purchase option contract

19

to purchase property.

20

wouldn't be considered to have a right in the property

21

unless and until the option was exercised.

22

that's the general rule, even though the purchase

contract in a sense constitutes a cloud on the title in

the same way that a lien might constitute a lien on the

in other areas of the law the Court has looked to
27

1

questions concerning whether there is a right to exclude

others, whether there is a right to obtain income from

the property, whether there is a right to assert

5

types of considerations this Court takes into account in

the tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can

attach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is

8

a right to property at stake.

9

sorts of consideration should inform the Court's

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. CARDOZO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

1

please the Court:

2

There are three reasons this case puts in

3

issue rights in immovable property:

4

language of the statute; second, the statute's purpose

5

and legislative history; and third, international

6

practice as it existed in 1976.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First, the plain

Mr. Cardozo, before you go

any further, I had been under the impression from your

brief that you're not trying to enforce anything

MR. CARDOZO:

So

2

conceded as soon as we filed the action, we can't

foreclose because of the provisions of Section 1610.

4

But it doesn't mean that the fact that we can't

5

foreclose doesn't mean that we don't have a right in

property.

7

there is a possessory dispute, someone, an embassy,

8

rented premises and agreed that if they didn't pay the

9

rent they would lose their ability to continue to occupy

10

the premises and they failed to pay rent, that's a title

dispute.

property and there is clearly a right in property in

14

Section 1605.

15

Congress intended to say, well, you can bring an action

for nonpayment of rent and seek possession except for

1610, that's okay.

MR. ROBERTS:

And the stopping place I think

19

is a Federalism concept and a due process concept,

because as this Court has held in a number of cases,

21

there's a real due process question if liens are created

22

with no concern about the effect on the defendant.

Now JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why didn't you just say -

3

you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of

4

countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if

5

they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of

6

stuff easements, which, which the other side says is

7

undoubtedly a property interest.

that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give

you an easement over the property of, of the defendant

2

others are trying to distinguish between whether the

3

lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't

4

grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to

5

work with and so I want to know how you see it.

6

And I noticed that the Restatements and

MR. CARDOZO:

And what I see, Justice

7

Breyer, is when you take a look at the cases in this

8

Court such as Connecticut against Doehr and the other

9

cases which put limits, the constitutional limits on

10

liens, of course if a State passed a statute that runs

11

afoul of the various due process concerns that this

12

Court has articulated that is certainly one check that

13

we have.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, let's take the

18

MR. CARDOZO:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that

19

would be a hard question, but if it does not run afoul

20

of the constitutional concerns that I just articulated

21

and it was a lien applicable not just of course to

22

foreign sovereigns, but to any unpaid parking ticket -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the only thing they

would have to do I suppose -- you've mentioned the due

before the lien was declared and that would be enough?

MR. CARDOZO:

I think, I think it certainly

would, Justice Souter, if in fact there was a hearing.

Well, provided that,

We are not talking about the abstract

JUSTICE STEVENS:

in final analysis is whether they have to pay their

taxes, isn't it?

8

MR. CARDOZO:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

I'm sorry.
The ultimate issue is

whether they have to pay their taxes.

11

MR. CARDOZO:

The ultimate substance -

12

underlying substantive issue is that but -- and of

13

course, the State Department even today says these taxes

14

should be paid.

15

there is a right in property.

16

you don't create a lien, if a particular State did not

17

create a lien, that would not give you the right, which

18

is what the statute, statutory language says.

kind of a footnote kind of question?

I mean you

3

referred again to the text.

4

on a very strict reading of the text as I understand it,

5

you don't have to claim a right in property, you have to

6

have a claim in -- in which someone's rights in

7

immovable property are in issue.

8

and so long as you create a cloud on the title, however

9

that cloud is classified, it puts in issue the title of

And if we are going to go

So whether the, the -

11

distinction between a lien and easement and so forth is

essentially irrelevant as long as it's a cloud on the

title.

be literal, isn't that so?

15

If we are going to be that, if we are going to

MR. CARDOZO:

I, I agree with that.

And

16

here today the right that India and Mongolia claim in

It looks at it from the foreign

MR. CARDOZO:

The European Convention

7

phrased differently looks at it from both sides, Justice

8

Scalia, which is why they needed the words obligation.

9

If you look at Article 9 of the European Convention it

10

first talks about the foreign sovereign's right or

11

interest in property, and then it says "or the foreign

12

sovereign's obligations arising out of that property."

That's a different phrase than the FSIA which doesn't

use the word foreign sovereign; it says "its" rights in

It would include a controversy

over that absolutely.

international practice because we should take a look at

It says it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you don't go

that far.

16

MR. CARDOZO:

That -- we don't have to go

that far because we believe we, as a -- we have a right

18

in property arising from the lien.

19

the foreign cases before we get to the European

20

Convention and we cite a number of them in footnote 24.

21

There is for example the case I referred to in response

22

to Justice Breyer, a suit over a mortgage.

23

24

over a mortgage.

25

Now let's look at

A suit over

It's not the commercial exception; a suit

analyzes broadly what's the meaning of this real

property exception.

3

cite says a security interest, a suit over security

4

interest for a mortgage, there is jurisdiction within

5

the immovable property exception.

6

And that case in England which we

There is a large number of cases.

You look

7

at the Harvard Review of 1932, the status of the law at

8

that time, extensive review of all the relevant cases,

9

says the same thing.

Then that brings us to the

10

European Convention which was adopted shortly before the

11

FSIA and which the State Department told Congress was

12

consistent with the FSIA.

13
14

25

there is a very broad immovable property exception that

I'm not looking just at

I'm looking at what does this convention

And that practice at the time as reflected by the

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should cover this kind of dispute.

2
3

Now let me make one, one or two final
points.

If this -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the -- the

5

convention used language quite different than that was

6

used by Congress.

7

international practice reflected in or arising out of

8

the convention is terribly pertinent.

9

So I'm not quite sure how that

MR. CARDOZO:

I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

I'm not talking just about the language.

11

about the European, the international practice as

12

reflected by that convention because the 1976

13

legislative history of the FSIA says we are trying to

14

conform United States practice into the, the practice

15

that is followed internationally.

16

I'm talking

And I -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in some cases

17

they used language directly from the convention and in

18

this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly

19

ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying

20

to do.

21

MR. CARDOZO:

Then I would say where did

22

they get that source from?

And that's where I cite the,

23

first the international cases themselves which reflect

24

as of 1976 the same philosophy reflected by the European

25

Convention.

There is no question that the wording is
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different.

2

saying is that wording conveys an intent from the

3

international point of view to have the broad parameters

4

of an international, of an immovable property exception

5

and that was consistent with the international cases

6

that have been decided at that time.

7

I'm not, I'm not disputing that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What I'm

Did their practice draw a

8

distinction between occupied by the ambassador himself

9

and property occupied by employees of the embassy?

10

MR. CARDOZO:

As a substantive matter,

11

Justice Stevens, the answer to that question is of

12

course yes.

13

-- 23 says that the premises of -- of the mission may

14

not be, may not be taxed.

15

1 to look at what is the meaning of premises of the

16

mission and they talk about where the business of the

17

mission is conducted, or where the ambassador resides.

18

It doesn't talk about the rest of the employees.

19

since 1952, the State Department even before the Vienna

20

convention and subsequent has been advising missions in

21

New York, it's on their web site today that they must

22

pay taxes on staff housing.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because the Vienna convention in Article 20

And then you look at Article

And

Can I ask you what, what do

24

you get out of this case?

You've withdrawn your claim

25

for judgment of foreclosure.

What are you going to get

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

out of it?

Declaratory judgment that they owe the

2

taxes?

3

don't owe taxes.

I'm not sure they have ever contested that they

4

MR. CARDOZO:

Oh yes I think if you look, if

5

you look at the Petitioners' brief I think they do

6

contest that they, that they have to pay the tax.

7

what we'll get out of this is the following.

8
9

But

First of all, start with the fact that the
statute says you can bring an action in this

10

jurisdiction even if you can't execute.

11

State Department telling us, the Solicitor General

12

telling us in their briefs, footnote 17, that countries

13

pay lawful taxes.

14

to judgment and get that, and get that declaration, we

15

believe based upon what the Solicitor General has said

16

they will pay their taxes.

So if we can get, if we can proceed

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. CARDOZO:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

You say he is wrong about a

lot of other stuff.
(Laughter.)

24

Yeah, but -

In addition -

21

23

We have the

Why do you believe him

about that?
MR. CARDOZO:

And the -- the reason I

believe him about that is that Congress has passed a law
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that says if you don't pay your taxes reflected by a

2

judgment, whatever the amount of that tax is, you're

3

going to lose 1110 percent of your foreign aid.

4

I believe we are going to get a lot out of that.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so

Can I -- can I can ask you

6

to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into

7

a muddle here.

8
9

I'm still now being very, very literal.

I

think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in

10

which is involved rights to property.

11

this is a right to property in this case; if I win this

12

case then I have a right to sell that house.

13

I have a right in property.

14

And you say, but

Therefore,

Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't

15

that apply to every case where a State might say if you

16

win this case you can sell his house?

17

easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a

18

State would say, you win, you can sell their house to

19

collect the judgment.

20

MR. CARDOZO:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I can

And So I'm still back in a

22

different route at where I'm having the problem, which

23

is a problem of distinguishing in principle between

24

either your absolute principle, "do it," his absolute

25

principle, "don't do it," or something in the middle.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. CARDOZO:

And I think the something in

2

the middle, Justice Breyer, is if you're talking about a

3

prejudgment lien which I think is your hypothetical.

4

It's -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The hypothetical was doing

6

away with the prejudgment lien.

I would say the exact

7

same words apply with just as much force if there is no

8

prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State

9

were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell

10

this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in

11

which there is at issue your right to sell his property,

12

just as there is here.

13

MR. CARDOZO:

But Justice, Justice Breyer,

14

in that hypothetical, you don't have a right in property

15

until you win the case.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. CARDOZO:

Do you?

We have, we have a, there is

18

an in issue today our right to property and I believe

19

that that is a distinction and I believe also -- and of

20

critical importance.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait a minute.

But

22

the -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is

23

brought, even before the final judgment.

24

let's give the devil his due.

25

which rights in immovable property are in issue.

So you know,

It would be a case in

MR. CARDOZO:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

And if You want to look at it from

the embassy side too so -

4

MR. CARDOZO:

Yes.

And if you want to look

5

at it from the embassy side under my theory, their right

6

-- under my lien their rights are an issue today.

7

under Justice Breyer's hypothetical if it meets the

8

other due process concerns which I think under that

9

hypothetical would raise a number of interesting ones -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Well, that's your big

11

defense.

To do that they would have to do it for

12

everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as

13

well as for the embassy, right?

14

MR. CARDOZO:

That's right.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

Is it only the case that

16

the, that the only instances in which, consistent with

17

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say

18

you get the house, would be instances of litigation

19

arising out of commercial activity?

20

MR. CARDOZO:

Yes.

That is -- that is -

21

that is correct.

Because it's only in the commercial

22

activities exception can you execute and then only in

23

certain limited circumstances -

24

don't that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act answers

the underlying substantive question.
