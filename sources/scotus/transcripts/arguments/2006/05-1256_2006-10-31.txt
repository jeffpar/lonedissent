ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. FREY:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case is here following this

10

Court's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their

11

decision in light of State Farm, a task at which we

12

submit the Oregon courts completely failed.

13

two independent but thematically interrelated issues,

14

both of which implicate what the Court said in State

15

Farm, which is that, and I quote, "courts must ensure

16

that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and

17

proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and

18

to the general damages recovered."

19

It presents

Now significantly, Respondent defends

20

neither -- oh, I should stop for a minute and describe

21

the issues.

22

Supreme Court properly held that Philip Morris was

23

correctly denied an instruction which would have told

24

the jury that it was not to punish for harm to

25

nonparties.

So the first issue is whether the Oregon

The Oregon Supreme Court held that that
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instruction was legally incorrect, it was proper for the

2

jury to punish for harm to nonparties, and therefore the

3

instruction was correctly denied.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

about what is numbered, is it number 34?

6

MR. FREY:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. FREY:

9

Mr. Frey, are you talking

Yes.

Yes.

That's the The key paragraph from

number 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as

10

well as numerous other places in the materials.

11

says, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable

12

relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the

13

defendant's punishable misconduct.

14

consider the extent of harm suffered by others in

15

determining what that reasonable relationship is, you're

16

not to punish the defendant for the impact of its

17

alleged misconduct of other persons who may bring

18

lawsuits of their own, etc.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

Although you may

You don't think that

20

would confuse the jury if they are first told that they

21

may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and

22

then the next instruction seems to say they can't?

23

MR. FREY:

I don't.

First of all, I don't

24

think that's what it says, and I don't think it would

25

confuse the jury, and I'm confident that with that
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instruction, counsel could explain it.

2

here, because I know this was something that Justice

3

Scalia expressed some uncertainty about in the State

4

Farm argument, and that the Oregon Supreme Court said

5

they didn't clearly understand.

6

But let me stop

To consider the conduct means to evaluate it

7

in connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the

8

conduct being punished.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't that the problem?

If

10

the instruction had said that, you would have a very

11

different instruction, and I'm bothered by the

12

instruction too for just that reason.

13

consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction,

14

I would say, "why?

15

to punish them."

16

It says you may

You've just told me I'm not supposed

MR. FREY:

Well, the second part of it is,

17

what punishment means is what would be done in a class

18

action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the

19

harm suffered by Oregon smokers.

20
21
22
23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

This is an argument

you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror
is supposed to figure this out.
MR. FREY:

Well, let me say a couple of

24

things about that.

First of all, the Oregon Supreme

25

Court did not rely on this aspect.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

It held that it was

Official

1

proper to punish for harm to nonparties.

2

our view, this instruction, and there's always a danger

3

when you add words to an instruction that you will add

4

something that a court will find was incorrect and

5

therefore deny the instruction, even though the essence

6

of it was correct.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now this, in

Where did the Oregon

8

Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to

9

nonparties?

Your brief quotes something to that effect,

10

but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to

11

the petition.

12

Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State

13

acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages

14

to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.

15

Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it

16

in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to

17

exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly

18

disease.

19

It says, what the Oregon court said is,

MR. FREY:

The

Well, I would refer the Court to

20

pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court

21

discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point.

22

it says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from

23

punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged

24

conduct on other persons even if those persons were

25

Oregonians who were harmed.

But on 28(a) it says,
6

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

because the proposed jury did not accurately reflect

2

the law, this is not a statement about Philip Morris's

3

position, the trial court did not commit reversible

4

error when it refused to give it.

5

was quite clear in saying -- let me complete my answer,

6

because I think considering it moves the needle along

7

the scale of allowable punishment for the harm to Jesse

8

Williams, but it does not abandon the principle of

9

proportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it

So I think the court

10

is what you would do in a class action.

11

punish for all the harms to all the Oregonians.

12

a one-way class action in which Philip Morris was

13

exposed to global punishment by the jury without any of

14

the protections of a class action.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You would
This is

So -

Let me -- let me -- let me

16

focus the problem that I have right now this way.

If

17

I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and

18

particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21,

19

I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the

20

opinion.

21

they were saying.

22

I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of

23

your client was not a clear instruction, I have great

24

difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error

25

to refuse to give the instruction.

I read them the same, just what you claimed
The difficulty that I have is because

MR. FREY:

Well -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So my problem is, if I

3

think they really did have the wrong view of the law but

4

the issue was focused at the trial court by a request

5

for an instruction which I think was properly denied,

6

what do I do?

7

opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the

8

deficiency of the instruction?

9

Do I concentrate on what they said in the

MR. FREY:

Well, I think what you do is

10

decide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they

11

were correct in the legal proposition that they

12

asserted.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But then they would

14

respond, when they made that, when they gave that

15

explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were

16

responding to a claim of error which was focused and

17

raised at the trial level by the request for an

18

instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound

19

instruction, an unsound request.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I guess we could

21

leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the

22

instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they

23

disallowed it for the reason that you say.

24

MR. FREY:

That's correct.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we can say that is
8

error and remand it to them.

very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not

MR. FREY:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

That might not make you

That's correct.
In effect, it would give

you another chance in Oregon.

7

MR. FREY:

But I do want to question the

8

premise.

First of all, the instruction says basically

9

what this Court said in BMW, which is where it drew

10

precisely that distinction.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

weren't instructing a jury.

13

MR. FREY:

It was a good thing we

Well, I don't think there is -

14

the concept may be abstract, the difference between

15

considering and punishing, but it's quite clear in this

16

Court's jurisprudence and I think it can be made quite

17

clear to the jury with the benefit of the proper

18

instruction, and I don't -- I don't have any -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I do too.

20

any trouble with the distinction.

21

MR. FREY:

I don't have

If we had this instruction, if we

22

had this instruction which I believe is correct, there

23

is nothing incorrect about this instruction.

24

correct that the jury may consider.

25

challenging that the jury may consider the conduct and

It is

But it doesn't answer the

It doesn't

How?

5

6

not to punish?

MR. FREY:

Consider for what?

Why am I

said -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. FREY:

I think the instruction says that

11

you are to consider it in connection with

12

determining the reprehensibility of the conduct.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

If it had said that, I

14

would have no trouble with it.

15

consider it in determining what the reasonable

16

relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse

17

Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed.

don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon

whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable

MR. FREY:

What it says is, you may

That's my problem

Well, they do, because conduct

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. FREY:

I don't.

But as this Court has made quite

3

clear, the reprehensibility of the conduct is an

4

important factor in determining where along the scale of

5

reasonable relationships in a particular case you might,

6

the relationship might be reasonable.

7

that is calculated to harm large numbers of people can

8

be found more blameworthy as to warrant a higher

explain the difference this way.

But let me try to

up with a number that can be properly replicated in case

causes of action for punitive damages that various

If you are punishing for the

10

Oregonians had.

11

that respect between considering and punishing for it,

12

and the Court has said repeatedly, and I don't think

13

we can contest this, that the character of the conduct

14

can be considered in determining the proper level or

15

allowable level of punitive damages, that included the

16

character of the conduct is the intended scope of the

17

harm, if it's an isolated incident, if it's a consistent

18

pattern of misconduct.

19

So there's a fundamental difference in

So, I don't think we could properly have told

enormous.

24

punitive damages class action and a jury that was told

25

that they had to punish for the harm to the particular

So -- and I

If you think about a jury that was deciding a

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiff in the, in the particular case, it's, it's

2

obvious that the results would be vastly different in

3

those cases.

4

that the jury would think of itself as the punishment

5

agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to

6

all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris -

7

And the problem we were worried about was

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Frey, let me

8

ask you a question.

Suppose this was a criminal case

9

and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the

10

judge in working out the sentence realizes he also

11

committed crimes B, C, D, and E.

12

into account in determining the extent of the sentence

13

given for crime A.

14

He could take those

Why isn't that similar?

MR. FREY:

It is similar, but what he can't

15

do is punish for crimes B, C, D, and E.

16

a mail fraud prosecution -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Suppose we had

And if there was a second

18

-- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X.

19

At that sentencing the judge could again take into

20

account the harm to defendants B, C, and D.

21

MR. FREY:

That's true.

That's certainly

22

true.

That's why our point is that it's one thing to

23

produce a punishment that can properly be replicated in

24

case after case without producing an excessive total

25

punishment.

It's another thing to punish in case after
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

case for the same harms.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's not the same harm

3

if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff

4

in the second case.

5

to be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal

6

case, why can't you in both cases take into account

7

that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?

8
9

You're punishing him for the harm

MR. FREY:

If this was a mail fraud

prosecution for defrauding Jesse Williams into buying

10

cigarettes and the punishment was five years for that,

11

the judge could consider in setting the punishment

12

between zero and five the fact that this was part of a

13

scheme that was intended to or may have deceived large

14

numbers of other people in setting the punishment

15

between zero and five.

16

what we were worried the jury would do here and what we

17

think the size of its verdict may suggest it actually

18

did here is to think that they could punish it that time

19

not just 5 years, but 10 or 15 or 20 for all of the

20

other punishments, for all the other wrongs that they

21

find to have been done.

22

What the judge cannot do and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In that respect, how does

23

the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this.

24

Oregon says that if a corporation commits

25

manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the corporation gained by committing the offense -

2

MR. FREY:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- is my understanding.

4

Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits

5

five manslaughters.

6

for $1 million.

7

dollars in every manslaughter case?

8
9

Would they be liable -- and gained

Would they be liable for twice a million

MR. FREY:

No.

But I think the disgorgement

argument that has been made by the other side suffers

10

from exactly the same problem as the global punishment

11

problem.

12

every case all the profits that were earned from selling

13

cigarettes to Oregonians and to Oregonians became who

14

sick -

15

That is, you can't -- if you disgorged in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mr. Frey, we don't

16

know what Oregon law is on that point.

17

have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they

18

must adjust in the next case.

19

would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said

20

part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff,

21

but to some State fund?

22

MR. FREY:

They do

And how would you deal -

I don't, I don't think that -

23

our complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the

24

money.

25

punished and what the procedural regime is that has led

Our complaint is with how much we're being

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the law in Oregon

3

were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive

4

damages or you can get only the difference between what

5

the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already

6

paid out in punitive damages?

7

9
10
11

MR. FREY:

Well, first of all, that's not

the law in Oregon.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We don't know what it is.

We haven't had the second case.
MR. FREY:

Well, we have no -- well, the

12

Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this, on this

13

statute, for purposes of dealing with the harm to

14

others, harm to nonparties problem.

15

not require giving credit, only consideration.

16

it, even if it did, it operates as a one-way ratchet.

17

That is, you keep making awards until you've reached the

18

maximum that would be allowable for all the conduct even

19

though juries, properly instructed, might have awarded

20

substantially less and even though many juries might

21

exonerate the defendant totally, as many juries have in

22

tobacco cases.

23

for having what amounts to excessive punishment or at

24

least unfair punishment.

25

The statute does
Even if

So the Oregon regime is, is a formula

And finally, the, the 30.925, which was
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

referred to by the court of appeals, requires submitting

2

this evidence to the jury and, as the trial court said

3

in this case at page 195a of the joint appendix, there

4

is no telling whether submitting the prior awards to the

5

jury would produce higher or lower awards in this case.

6

So I think it's an entirely illusory protection to rely

7

on that.

Can I ask you -- are you

finished?

10

Yes.

11

because our concern is structural with the design of the

12

Oregon system as it's been approved by the Oregon

13

Supreme Court, I don't think this inadequate remedy can

14

save that system.

it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you

think.

20

say, there are many issues in this case, some of them

21

very difficult, but one thing we're certain about:

22

cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause

23

in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from

24

the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the

25

purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did

I don't know whether he was making

We wouldn't

Mr. Frey, I suppose

your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying

tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses

12

that might be available with respect to other, other

13

individuals who are harmed.

14

MR. FREY:

Certainly.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this argument

16

wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't

17

susceptible to those sorts of defenses.

18

MR. FREY:

It would still apply because

19

different factfinders, different juries, might reach

20

different conclusions on the same evidence, assuming

21

that a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper.

22

What you're doing is preempting, you're allowing a

potentially aberrational verdict, which there could be

24

in many cases, to preempt the work of other juries.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The jury can't really find

that other people were harmed.

The jury doesn't have

the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20

MR. PECK:

Thank you, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

21

I'll start with the proposed

22

instruction because that is where Philip Morris began

23

and the Oregon courts properly treated that as an

24

enigma.

25

both that they could consider the extent of harm and not

It told the jury, it would have told the jury,

25

consider the extent of harm with respect to a reasonable

2

relationship.

3

Clearly, that is not what this Court has said.

4

what, it's not what the Oregon Supreme Court did.

5

also significant if you look at the actual proposed

6

instruction, which is, starts on page 240, 279(a) of the

7

joint appendix, the, the proposed instruction says you

8

may consider whether the imposition of punitive damages

9

is necessary to punish and deter similar misconduct by

That's the disparity guide post.
And
It's

10

defendant and others in the future.

Now, that's part of

11

a calculation that considers harm to others in the

12

future as a potential harm.

13

things that the Oregon Supreme Court discussed when it

14

said that this does not reflect our law.

So that is one of the

15

It's also significant that they said that

16

you could consider financial condition and you cannot

17

consider financial condition which is part of the Oregon

18

statute.

19

that we have conflated an alternative instruction with

20

one that they offered but if you look at page 280(a) -

21

Now Philip Morris in their reply brief says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

counsel.

23

instruction proposed here?

You're losing me,

What, what specifically is wrong with the

24

MR. PECK:

This instruction -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As briefly as possible,

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one, two, three.

2

MR. PECK:

This instruction basically

3

advises the jury to do precisely what Philip Morris

4

argues before this Court it cannot do and that is to

5

take into account the harm suffered by others in

6

determining this disparity.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- you object to in

8

this instruction.

I mean, and I thought our cases

9

clearly established that you can consider the harm to

10

others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the

11

conduct.

12
13

You don't disagree with that?
MR. PECK:

We don't disagree with that and

that's precisely what the Oregon Supreme Court did.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On the other hand,

15

you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the

16

defendant for those harms particularly in a case where

17

the defendant might have defenses available with respect

18

to those others.

19

sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but

20

the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior

21

cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between

22

assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to

23

others.

24
25

So I understood what the instruction

MR. PECK:

We submit that it was

unsuccessful in conveying properly what this Court has
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

held and that is sufficient grounds for the Oregon

2

Supreme Court to uphold the trial court's decision.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would it have been a proper

4

instruction if the second sentence had read, although

5

you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in

6

determining what the -- what that reasonable

7

relationship is, although you may consider the extent of

8

harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the

9

crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence -

10

what, what that reasonable relationship is?

11

just added in that additional thought.

12

MR. PECK:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

that's left out of it.

15

make it erroneous?

16

MR. PECK:

If you had

Justice Scalia, if that It seems to me that's all

Now does leaving that out of it

Leaving that out made it

17

erroneous because it said, not with respect to

18

reprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable

19

relationship.

20

That was erroneous.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes but reprehensibility

21

analysis is part of the reasonable relationship.

22

more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be,

23

according to our cases as I understand it.

24
25

MR. PECK:

The

Let me take a step back because I

think there is a confusion here over also the word

1

punishment.

2

they punish misconduct.

3

distinction because harm is a compensatory concept.

4

compensate others for harm and of course you cannot

5

compensate others for harm in the course of this case.

6

But you can consider the potential risks, the potential

7

harm and the future harm if this course of misconduct is

8

not deterred.

9
10

Punitive damages do not punish for harm,
And this is an important

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PECK:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I'm saying -

MR. PECK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

to consider harm.

14

16

You're saying this

instruction was too favorable to you -

11

13

You

--this instruction -And you don't think they

should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?
MR. PECK:

This instruction as the Oregon

18

Supreme Court said, you know, doesn't provide the

19

clarity that Philip Morris hoped to provide to the jury.

20

And it says and they can't see how this summarizes

21

Philip Morris' interpretation of Campbell.

22

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's in

at first blush that it's completely right.

2

consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others

3

in determining what the reasonable relationship is.

4

you have to be sophisticated in this.

5

the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that

6

the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the

7

ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered

8

by this victim in court.

You may

13

ratio should be.

14

the conduct.

15

for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other

16

persons who aren't here in court.

17

you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who

has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in

19

court, think about her suffering, which is real and

20

serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant

21

because of what he did to her.

22

human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless,

23

the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do.

24

So reading it as I just read it naturally,

25

That means it goes to the evilness of

In other words, what

MR. PECK:

I'm looking for a real

I'm posing it in a hostile way

instruction had been given the way you have just stated

But it's not

how it reads.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. PECK:

Yes.

And it's not what it does.

It

13

starts out saying that reasonable relationship is about

14

the harm to Jesse Williams and then it says you may

15

consider the harm suffered by others in determining that

16

reasonable relationship.

17

help you figure out what the relationship to Jesse

18

Williams is?

19

Well, how does harm to others

It doesn't compute.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, because the

20

instructions indicate and juries often do this that

21

punitive damages are certain multiple of the

22

compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are

23

saying.

24

consider whether they have harmed others.

25

instruction would make all the difference to the world

In determining what that multiple should be you

And this

in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about.

If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say,

5

perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the

Counsel, it seems to me the

17

point you're making is not the basis on which the

Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was

19

properly disallowed.

20

it was properly disallowed because you can take into

21

account directly the harm to other people, isn't that

22

the case?

The Supreme Court of Oregon said

23

MR. PECK:

That is not the case.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. PECK:

Okay.

Why not?

As Justice Ginsburg pointed out
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

earlier, the citations that they have used in their

2

brief are to the characterization of Philip Morris'

3

argument.

4

and that second paragraph there starts out with "using

5

harm to others as part of the ratio may have been correct

6

under the plurality opinion in TXO" --and then you jump

7

down to, "however, it no longer appears to be

8

permissible if it ever was."

9

But if you look at 30(a) in the petition -

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what about footnote 3, on

10

page 18(a)?

11

punish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is

12

difficult to see why it may consider it at all.

13

On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot

MR. PECK:

And that's because of the nature

14

of this conduct.

This is not conduct that was directed

15

at Jesse Williams and he was the sole recipient of what

16

Philip Morris did here.

18

decisions at the highest levels of the company to

19

deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health.

20

They knew that this would have a special impact on those

21

22

this is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter.

of misconduct if instead society's interest has to be

for that type of conduct?

MR. PECK:

And as long as

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

When it

What do you say, I mean

20

Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote.

21

And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the,

22

your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you

23

basically the same question about what the Oregon

24

Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the

25

bottom of 20(a) up to 21.

It says "Philip Morris's
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the

2

jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its

3

alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other

4

persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same

5

conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way.

6

As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter

7

of Oregon law," and so on.

8
9

That is not a totally unambiguous statement.
I will concede that, but isn't the most obvious

10

reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can

11

punish for harm to others, so long as those others are

12

Oregonians and not people in other States?

13

MR. PECK:

I believe, Justice Souter that

14

what the court was doing there which is somewhat similar

15

to the analysis below in the Oregon Court of Appeals,

16

was to talk about the prospective future victims of this

17

fraud, that if it were not deterred which is a

18

consideration that the Oregon statute makes clear, if it

19

was not deterred then this kind of consideration for the

20

same acts having the same effect on others then doesn't

21

allow you to make sure that on that scale that this is

22

at the high end of what we are -

23

Justice SOUTER:

That's a, that's a, I will

24

assume that's a legitimate reading in your favor.

25

the answer, I mean, I think the response has to be after

before, isn't perhaps the better, the better course to

to enact a statute that guides the courts on the, guides

9

the juries and the courts in the assessment of punitive

damages.

11

You know, first there is a threshold.

12

Before you can even plead punitive damages you must meet

13

that threshold and you must demonstrate to the court by

14

admissible evidence that there was a reckless and

15

outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of

16

harm, that they've acted with a conscious indifference

17

to the health and safety and welfare of others.

18

this is part of what infuses it with public purpose.

19

Then -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
is the division?

Now,

May I just ask you what

How much of this -

MR. PECK:

60 percent of an award by statute

23

goes to a crime victims fund of the State of Oregon and

24

as soon as the judgment is rendered then the State

25

becomes a judgment creditor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That has no

2

relevance to the question of the extent to which the

3

defendant is being punished, does it?

4

MR. PECK:

No, but the statutory criteria

5

which requires that the jury find by clear and

6

convincing evidence the following factors, which was

7

given to this jury in the fashion that I'm about to tell

8

you, constrains this award and I think properly makes it

9

reasonable.

10

First, you have to consider whether there is

11

a likelihood that serious harm would arise from the

12

defendant's misconduct.

13

defendant's awareness of that likelihood.

14

profitability in the State of Oregon.

Four, duration of

15

the misconduct and concealment of it.

Five, the

16

attitude and the conduct of the defendant upon discovery

17

of the misconduct.

18

condition of the defendant, which cuts both ways.

19

protects a defendant from being bankrupted by punitive

20

damages while at the same time assures that punitive

21

damages are enough to have that deterrent effect.

22

Second, the degree of the
Three,

And then finally, financial
It

Now even after that, the defendant could opt

23

to have the jury address whether they had been

24

previously punished for this misconduct or choose not

25

to, which you would expect most defendants to choose,

and instead post verdict, present that to the trial

JUSTICE BREYER:

The trouble with the more

4

basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but

5

it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors

6

like that, or many do.

7

quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you

8

know.

9

products liability.

Alabama did.

You know, not

And there are other cases that would bring up
And it's pretty hard to think of a

10

products liability case where the jury found negligence,

11

where they might not also find these factors.

12

in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the

13

company.

14

seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim

15

in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often

16

is, at least in this instance.

17

five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been,

18

well, you read the jury factors like that and they can

19

do almost anything.

20

anything goes that I found disturbing.

21

Because

Somebody will have been hurt and likely

And now you read these

And it's that, it's that fact that

MR. PECK:

But this last factor that I was

22

about to get to, which I think provides a constraint

23

that's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases,

24

and that is the total deterrent effect of other

25

punishment imposed in any remedial measures the
39

defendant has taken.

2

the trial judge, saying okay, we have this huge award,

3

but, you know, we have been fined by the government, we

4

have had punitive damages assessed against us in other

5

cases, and as a result we have taken the following

6

measures which assure that we will not engage in this

7

kind of misconduct again, and as a result also, this

8

award should be cut.

Now this can be presented first to

Do you say this after the

The jury doesn't hear this?

11

MR. PECK:

The jury does not.

You have the

12

option of presenting it to the jury but you do not have

13

to present it to the jury.

14

the trial judge and you can also present it at the

15

16

You can present it first to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems very odd that a

major argument for constraint is something that the jury

18

can't hear.

19

irrational nature of the exercise.

20

It just goes to show, really, the

MR. PECK:

I would suggest it's not

21

irrational because what you do is, you've given the

22

defendant the option as a strategic matter either to

23

present it to the jury or if they think that will

24

guarantee an award of punitive damages against them,

25

they can withhold it and present it only to the trial

2

than, you know, an oddity, I think.

3

This is a protection to the defendant rather

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

4

Assuming there's a distinction, and the instruction

5

does, between taking into account the extent of harm to

6

others on the one hand and punishing for the extent of

7

harm on the other.

8

about the five parts of the instructions, none of them

9

really authorized punishment for harm to others.

As I understand what you recited

10

MR. PECK:

That is correct, and -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And is it also true that

12

the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems

13

to me that could be an argument that you should take

14

into account the extent of harm to others, but it does

15

not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on.

16

And the question I want to ask, are there other parts

17

of the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel

18

argued that you should take into account, that you

19

should punish for harm to others?

20

MR. PECK:

There is not.

The only argument

21

that was made in closing was that you can think about

22

the others, which was clearly intended to go towards

23

that reprehensibility analysis.

24

the criminal law context, an attempted crime is punished

25

as badly as an actual crime when all the elements that

You know, certainly in

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

are required to, to accomplish that crime have occurred.

2

And in the context of this very unusual long in duration

3

misconduct, what you had to do was you had to look at

4

that broad attempt to effect Oregon -

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think juries can,

6

Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what

7

they are told if they are told, you can take into

8

account conduct directed at other people for the purpose

9

of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you

10

can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?

I believe they can.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. PECK:

First of all, if they They can understand that

distinction and -

15

17

This -- this

I believe they can.
And you would have them

apply that principle in this case?
MR. PECK:

They understood contributory or

19

comparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis

20

of negligence.

21

claim by only awarding a little bit more than $21,000,

22

even though the request was much higher.

23

They made a distinction in, in the fraud

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if they can

24

understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense

25

counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing

2

reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say,

3

but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you

4

answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that

5

distinction?

6

MR. PECK:

I believe the defense counsel

7

would have been entitled to make such an argument.

8

don't think there would have been any need for

9

corrective instruction.

I

But what they proposed, which

10

was conflicting in two different respects, just did not

11

meet the muster.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it

13

would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if

14

they had proposed an instruction that said, you may

15

consider the harm to others in assessing how

16

reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish

17

Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had

18

no objection to that instruction?

19

MR. PECK:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have had no objection.
So your only objection is

21

that they left out the reason why it is relevant to

22

determining what the ratio should be?

23

say you can consider it in connection with

24

reprehensibility.

25

They just didn't

Why is that crucial?

MR. PECK:

I think it was critical and of
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

course, you know, Oregon is entitled to run its court

2

system as it has for more than 30 years.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But why was it critical?

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why was it critical?

5

MR. PECK:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why was it corrected?
Yeah.

Justice Scalia said,

7

you know, they left out this one little bit.

8

that critical?

9

Why was

What's the answer.

MR. PECK:

Well, the answer is because,

10

again, it was not directed for the specific purpose for

11

which harm to others may be considered, and that's in

12

the reprehensibility analysis.

13

between the parties on that.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is no disagreement

You're saying, I think

15

you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out

16

without somebody telling them?

17
18

MR. PECK:
him -

19
20
21

But what this instruction told

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't that what you're

saying?
MR. PECK:

No, I'm not saying that.

What

22

the instruction told them is to consider it with respect

23

to the reasonable relationship.

24

That means proportionality.

25

Justice Stevens suggested, that they might multiply it

That means the ratio.

And that would suggest, as

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

by how many people are out there, because I think this

2

instruction was an enigma and was confusing.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Too favorable to you.

Too

favorable to you again, right?

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. PECK:

You know, perhaps so.

But you

7

know, the fact of the matter is that, you know, we did

8

not advocate that the jury punish for harm to others.

9

We do not believe the Oregon court upheld this judgment

10

for that reason.

11

If I can go on to the, some of the other

12

points that are made by Philip Morris.

13

this Court's decision in State Farm as if it were

14

nothing more than a ratio, so they reduce the decision

15

to ratio.

16

reprehensibility, into a subsidiary role in the ratio

17

analysis.

18

They talk about

They transform the most important indicium,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I make, just to

19

get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to

20

reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive

21

damages precedents?

22

MR. PECK:

No, we are not asking you to do

23

that.

We think that this, this judgment is valid under

24

those precedents.

25

which this Court has said is the first consideration,

They denigrate the State's interest

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the State's interest in deterrence to this

2

fractionalized sort of passenger on each individual

3

lawsuit, even though the State's interest here when we

4

get to the punitive damages phase, it's infused with

5

public purpose, that State interest is in deterring

6

misconduct, not in figuring out how many dollars might

7

be additionally awarded to the plaintiff or even into

8

its crime victims fund.

9

flexibility and ability to experiment with different

It removes the State's

10

ways to address the concerns that this Court has stated

11

with respect to punitive damages.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It depends when you say

13

something about duplicative recoveries, because that

14

seems to be a major concern.

15

MR. PECK:

This total deterrent effect

16

requirement is the key here, that this is a part of a

17

State statute that says that to the extent that there

18

had been prior punitive damage awards that have operated

19

to affect that deterrence that the State is interested

20

in, to the effect that there have been other

21

punishments, to the effect that there had been remedial

22

measures taken to prevent such misconduct again in the

23

future, then the judge is to reduce this award.

24

Oregon Supreme Court has said that this fully addresses

25

the concern with multiple awards, duplicative awards,
