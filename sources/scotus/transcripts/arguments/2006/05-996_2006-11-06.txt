Mr. Baker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BAKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Section 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code

11

provides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter

12

7 to a case under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code

13

at any time if the case has not been converted previously

14

from another chapter, and that any waiver of the right

15

to convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable.

16

Other subsections of section 706 give rules for the

17

Court to decide about conversion in the case where some

18

party other than the debtor requests conversion of the

19

case and also provides that the conversion must lead to

20

a chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a

21

debtor.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Baker, as I

23

understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in

24

this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13

25

and that relief was denied.

You're now seeking under 3

10

present -- the new case, the court decided that he was not

14

eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory

15

limitations that exist section 109(e).

16

three-year time span between the two, and we believe

17

that the existing case is not moot because he still has

18

remedies that he can obtain in Chapter 13.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact, in that -- in the

There is a

But if he isn't

20

eligible -- the new case determined that he was not

21

eligible because his debts were too high.

23

proceeding one and proceeding two?

24

MR. BAKER:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He didn't

Or he didn't reduce the

that he is ineligible, that is number one condition

3

to convert into Chapter 13.

4

condition, that's the end of the matter.

5

If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court

MR. BAKER:

If you don't meet that

I wouldn't say it would be the

6

end of the matter in the present case because the

7

eligibility was never questioned below, was never a

8

factor below.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But now there has been a

10

finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be

11

eligibility.

12

findings in the later case have preclusive effect?

13

And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's

MR. BAKER:

In the prior case?

I would say

14

no, Your Honor.

16

never raised below.

18

clearly within the statutory limits based -- just

19

looking at his schedules.

20

First, because as I mentioned, the

And in fact, if you look at his

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's a question you

21

can argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but

22

for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that

23

determination, which I think would be preclusive on

24

another bankruptcy court.

25

MR. BAKER:

The -- well, the -- the

bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case,

2

the new case, but they haven't dismissed it.

3

is in fact on appeal to the District Court for the

4

District of Massachusetts.

5

is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly

6

looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior

7

case.

8
9

Dismissal

The reason is, in our view

Now, it is a difficult issue in some
respects because there is case law at least in

10

Massachusetts or the First Circuit that says a debtor

11

does not have standing to object to claims in a Chapter

12

7 case.

13

filed and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case,

17

ultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we

18

will be within the statutory limits.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the decision is

20

affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think

21

you could still argue that there's qualification for

22

Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a

23

determination that there isn't?

We have now a judgment that

a three-year difference between the two and

8

substantially different facts.

case that are the issue.

12

of doing objections to those claims and I think that

13

ultimately we will come within them.

14

The -- we have to go

As I say, we are in the process

They're not at issue as far

15

as this mootness question goes.

16

And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to

18

file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.

21

still on appeal.

22

there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and

23

yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you

24

can apply under Chapter 13.

So I

Should we not take as a given that

MR. BAKER:

It doesn't make any sense.

Well, I would respectfully say 7

suggest that it does, Your Honor, because once -- we don't

2

really get to the eligibility question until the court

3

below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar.

4

We have to, as I say, we are in the process of objecting to

5

claims and resolving them.

6

Now the -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, didn't you make that

7

argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you

8

were not eligible?

9

MR. BAKER:

No, Your Honor, because as I

10

mentioned before, the case law in the First Circuit up

11

to this point has held that a Chapter 7 debtor does not

12

have standing to object to claims.

13

in fact, the bankruptcy court -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now in the new case,

That's what I'm asking.

15

Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor

16

presumably does.

17

to the bankruptcy court.

So didn't you make the same argument

Didn't you make before that court the same

MR. BAKER:

I did.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BAKER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. BAKER:

They rejected it, right?

Pardon?
And they rejected it?

The bankruptcy court did reject

10

it, yes.

But they rejected it because, as I say, up to

11

that point the case law had held that we did not have

12

standing to object to the claims, so we were bound by

13

what was there.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BAKER:

Right.
But you are applying under

Chapter 13.
MR. BAKER:

Right.

What I'm trying to say

20

is in the previous Chapter 7 case we lacked standing to

21

object to those claims and that in the new Chapter 13

22

case the court took the Chapter 7 case claims and said,

23

you're bound by these in the new chapter 13 case.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Didn't you object to that

and say you should look at these claims afresh?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BAKER:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what did the court say?

3

Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found

4

them over the limit.

5

MR. BAKER:

It -- the bankruptcy court in

6

the new case said -- pardon?

The bankruptcy court in

7

the new case said that there are circumstances under

8

which a debtor would have standing.

9

a new rule of law for that, for this district.

This was in effect
So

10

subsequent to that decision we did, in fact, object to

11

quite a number of claims and substantially reduced the

12

total of those claims, and I think that once -

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What did the bankruptcy

court say?
MR. BAKER:

The bankruptcy court sustained

16

our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the

17

total substantially.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

19

But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for

20

Chapter 13 treatment?

21
22
23

MR. BAKER:

We are not finished with the

claims objection process.

I believe that once we are -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course you are.

They've

24

rendered a decision.

How could you not be finished with

25

the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has

MR. BAKER:

Because the bankruptcy court

4

case.

5

old case.

6

We are objecting to the Chapter 7 claims in the
I apologize if this is confusing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is terribly confusing.

7

It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had

8

the responsibility for determining whether you qualified

9

under the, you know, under the amount of debt.

10

MR. BAKER:

And it did so by reference to

11

the claims that had been filed in the previous Chapter 7

12

case.

13

that haven't been filed.

14

back to the Chapter 7 case and do the claims objections

15

within the context of the old Chapter 7 case.

16

We can't object to claims in a Chapter 13 case
So procedurally, we had to go

Now, in the Chapter 13 case we used the -

17

the bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that

18

had been filed in the Chapter 7 case to determine

19

eligibility in the 13.

20

In doing so, the bankruptcy court basically

21

announced a new rule of law that the claims that had

22

been filed would be essentially I suppose, res judicata

23

in the subsequent case, but that in some cases a

24

Chapter 7 debtor -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you objected to that, I

11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

gather?

2

MR. BAKER:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Sorry?
You objected to that, to

that ruling?

5

MR. BAKER:

Not necessarily, because it does

6

give you a vehicle to go back to the old Chapter 7 case

7

and do the procedural claims objections in that case,

8

which is what we did, and we substantially reduced the

9

total of the claims.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the status of the

11

If we just could go to the

2

means you can convert no matter what?

MR. BAKER:

The plain language of the

statute says that, yes, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No matter what?

Okay,

6

suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert.

can you convert?

9

MR. BAKER:

I'm sorry.

Then

Would you repeat

that?

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm just producing examples

11

where it's clear you can't convert.

Now, suppose

12

Congress -- there is no Chapter 13.

Could you convert

13

then?

14

MR. BAKER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BAKER:

Yes.

No inheritance, no

nothing.

Suppose he dies.

Could you convert then?

17

19

No, okay.

MR. BAKER:

Well, there is a rule, I believe

it's JUSTICE BREYER:

Even though there's no such

23

person existing any more.

He's gone and his whole

24

family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing.

25

Then can he convert?

No.

convert.

That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but

rule says -

conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of

12

people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as

13

a signal that they should mail their life savings into a

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Baker, couldn't the

8

thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7

The first

case, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back

19

court's reasons for wanting to say that.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but your claim doesn't

21

rest on a due process denial of hearing does it?

That's

22

not, that's not the question you brought to us.

23

seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not

24

answered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that

25

case.

So it

The fact remains that in that case the, as I
15
Alderson Reporting Company

understand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately

2

deconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?

3

MR. BAKER:

4

immediately reconvert.

5

requirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be

6

heard on the issue.

7

Well, I wouldn't say he could
Again, there is the due process

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But due process is not the

8

issue here.

The fact is the bankruptcy court could

9

deconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect,

10

following the election that the debtor makes.

11

so, isn't it?

12

MR. BAKER:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's

Yes.
Well then, why would we

14

have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court

15

from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of

16

election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of

17

converting to 13, and immediately turn around,

18

admittedly having the power, to deconvert?

19

be a rather foolish system.

That would

20

MR. BAKER:

21

system that Congress has given us.

22

the debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not

23

been converted previously.

24
25

Well, perhaps, but it is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Congress has said

When cases are

reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?
MR. BAKER:

Most of the time, a plan is -- I

3

don't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a

4

plan at the same time as they file the notice, the

5

motion to convert.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. BAKER:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9
10

But they don't have to.

They don't have to.
And the deconversion could

be done prior to the filing of the plan?
MR. BAKER:

I suppose arguably it could.

In

11

my view, the statutory provisions of section 1307 have to

12

be applied to the question of conversion.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I think -

Creditors -- under

14

Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the

15

plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they

16

would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?

17

MR. BAKER:

That's correct.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So presumably the

19

creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan

20

looks like themselves.

21

MR. BAKER:

Exactly.

Exactly.

Exactly.

22

And I think it's the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy

23

Appellate Panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor

24

files a plan and gets it confirmed, pays creditors,

25

and everybody winds up better off.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the district

Could the bankruptcy court make

3

that same determination in deciding whether or not to

4

allow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted?

5

could make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding?

6

says:

7

because there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the

8

creditors come out.

of this transfer back and then the transfer back, which

11

is a waste of time.

12

MR. BAKER:

Well, again, the statute says

13

that the debtor may convert except in certain

14

circumstances.

15

to convert a case gives the court the procedural

16

mechanism for looking at the case, seeing, making sure

17

that the debtor -

18

I think that the requirement of a motion

Now, assuming you're going to have some
exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?
MR. BAKER:

Because ultimately the Chapter

13 trustee has the same powers of the Chapter 7 trustee

16

with the exception, as Your Honor is pointing out, of

17

possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate.

But that's how Congress wrote the statute.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I think You can't provide any reason

why there's a difference between those two?

14

MR. BAKER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

You deny -- do you dispute

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it gives notice and

an opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period 20

you have to give 20 days notice before the conversion

2

takes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?

I believe that's correct.

When

you file a motion, a 20 day notice is required, yes.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it has the hearing during

6

that period, you don't dispute that the court could do

7

that, or do you?

8
9

MR. BAKER:

Well, again we come to the

question of when the plan gets filed.

The plan isn't

10

filed until after it's converted, according to the

11

rules.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

hearing on the motion to convert, right?

14

hearing?

15

MR. BAKER:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But here there was a
There was a

Yes, Your Honor.
And as I understand it,

17

there was no objection to the character of that hearing?

18

There was no request for an evidentiary hearing?

19

there was a hearing.

20

just the way, the determination that you couldn't

21

convert?

22

MR. BAKER:

So

Now, does that get wiped out too,

The procedure I would, I would

23

expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact

24

with respect to whether the case had been converted or

25

whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an

2

evidentiary hearing would be required.

3

If -- the fact that there was no evidentiary

4

hearing in the particular case here, I think, I think we

5

have to go back to recognize the fact that most issues

6

in bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion

7

practice.

8
9

And it is my feeling that, the
jurisprudence of rule 56 has to apply.

If a court

10

sees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court

11

must schedule an evidentiary hearing.

12

cannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance

13

issue of fact.

14

that on these two -- the two particular points -- and

15

obviously, the question of whether it has been

16

previously converted is very easy to determine.

17

previously discussed, the issue of eligibility, whether

18

the claims and the debt is within the statutory

19

limitation, is an issue of fact that ultimately might

20

require an evidentiary hearing.

21

It cannot, it

So this is why I say that,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But as

But your case as I

22

understand it, your case does not turn on the question

23

whether there was or was not, should or should not have

24

been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in

25

this case; is that correct?
22

MR. BAKER:

That's correct.

That's correct,

2

5

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I

7

have a question on a matter that really upsets me

8

and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can

9

rely upon your description here.

You claimed in the

10

petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter

11

7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time.

12

And that he decided to go to 13 after he became

13

employed.

14

Yet, on -- as shown in the supplemental

15

appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty

16

of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at

17

the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath

18

that he was employed.

19
20

What was it?

Was he employed or not

employed?

21

MR. BAKER:

On the petition date itself, he

22

was not.

And if you look at schedule I, which is at

23

page 30 of the supplemental joint appendix, at the

24

bottom line, bottom of the -- and it indicates that he

25

was in the process of having a second tenant in his

No, he was -- he was not employed

15

at the time.

If you look at his page 18, as you

16

point out, it says at the bottom the income given is

17

estimated based on a new job which is about to start.

18

He had -- he had been the principal of a company called RLM

19

Flooring, which had been closed by Citizens Bank.

20

was, in fact, unemployed because Citizens Bank had taken

21

all of the assets of the corporation and shut it down.

22

And this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he

was very concerned about finding employment so he could

makes the motion to convert, which you say he has an

22

absolute right to make, what if the record then

should the bankruptcy judge do in that case?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The bankruptcy court need not sit idly by

3

and grant a motion which is part of an abusive scheme.

4

The power of the court is there to deny such a motion.

5

It is there by statute under section 105; it is there

6

because the courts have always had power.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under -- you think

8

105 is an affirmative grant of power?

9

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think the second sentence

10

of 105(a) supports the traditional powers that courts

11

have had to grant relief, to prevent or to deny relief

12

to prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct.

13

fact that the debtor has the authorization under section 706

14

to convert a case cannot be construed to prevent the

15

court from sua sponte taking action to prevent abuse -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

105(a) is much more

17

limited than that.

It is only if you take the second

18

clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been

19

done, that it looks like an affirmative grant.

20

"No provision of this title providing for the raising of

21

an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to

22

preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action."

23

That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you

not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement

25

that a particular party raise an issue.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Chief Justice Roberts,

5

I think that in order to understand 106(a), the second

6

sentence, completely, I think it is important to

7

understand it was added to 105 in 1986 in response to a

8

number of decisions that were holding that the courts

9

did not have the -- the bankruptcy courts did not have

10

the authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse,

11

to monitor their own calendars, to make sure that

12

inappropriate things weren't happening, and that Senator

13

Hatch when he introduced this legislation which was

14

ultimately enacted, the goal was to overturn cases like

15

the Second Circuit's decision in Grissom to provide

16

expressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they

17

intended, to give the courts this power.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I -

Was that Second Circuit's

decision a decision that said the court didn't have the

power because it had not been moved to take that action

issue?

the fact that a party has the right to make an action shall

It doesn't say exactly that the courts may take any
It says shall not be construed;

But I think that the implication of the

10

statute is clear.

courts may take action to prevent abuse.

17

they must do so.

complicit in the fraud or misdealing.

you're arguing for here?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

But the debtor could argue in

the context of the motion to convert, well, I would like

to propose a Chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct

5

wasn't that severe, and the court can take that into

consideration allowing the debtor to proceed.

8

be entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular

of limitations that require the district court, when it

recognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and

case, the bankruptcy court looks at the circumstances,

17

holds a hearing as was held this case, considers the

18

views of the parties who are involved, and then decides.

19

Now it is a relatively high bar.

Where those occur as in this

You know,

bad faith -- it is a continuum.

clearly no bad faith implication would apply.

the other end of the spectrum where you have a debtor

think the second bankruptcy case that was filed while

higher.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, the creditors are hurt

13

because in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case

14

is filed, the trustee takes possession of all the

15

debtor's property, which becomes property of the estate.

16

The trustee's role is to liquidate the property and

17

distribute the proceeds to creditors.

revests in the debtor, including any concealed property.

said, quote, "neither the permissive language of the
