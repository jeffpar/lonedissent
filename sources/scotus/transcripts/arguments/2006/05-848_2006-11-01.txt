CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument first this morning in Environmental Defense

5

versus Duke Energy Corporation.

Mr. Donahue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN H. DONAHUE

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8

10

MR. DONAHUE:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Clean Air Act requires that the owner of

11

a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of

12

significant deterioration permit before engaging in a

13

modification, which is defined to include any physical

14

change that increases the amount of any pollutant

15

emitted by such source.

16

Since 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have

17

measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in

18

tons per year.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a disputed

20

point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the

21

regulations measured PSD emissions through that device

22

rather than the hourly emissions.

23

MR. DONAHUE:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, but the text of the regulations refers

25

pervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

major modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and

2

subsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers

3

pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions

4

exclusively in tons per year.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is a little of an

6

exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the

7

issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the

8

way that you prefer.

9

program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the

10
11

In fact, the director of the PSD

interpretation that opposing counsel took.
MR. DONAHUE:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

12

Respondent has relied heavily on two early applicability

13

determinations.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Rightly so, I think.

I

15

mean, it was the earliest, application of the

16

regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in

17

charge of the program.

18

MR. DONAHUE:

Well, Justice Scalia, as we

19

point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt

20

Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it.

21

that a new source performance standard modification must

22

precede a PSD major modification.

23

relies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations

24

for increases in hours of operation and the production

25

rate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous

He doesn't say

Instead, in both he

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

preamble, that provision by its terms is an exception

2

from the definition of physical change.

3

It is not a provision that says -- increase

4

is attributable to a physical change, to increased hours

5

that are enabled by physical change, are not considered.

6

The plain language of the regulation actually

7

contradicts this reading.

8

themselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are

9

two of dozens of such determinations.

10

These determinations

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, whatever the reason

11

he gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when

12

the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not

13

participate, when that challenge was brought, were

14

these -- were those opinions already out there?

15

MR. DONAHUE:

Those opinions were out there

16

but the plain language of the regulation and the

17

preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion

18

was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to

19

link the coverage of PSD to construction activity.

20

we have here is a physical change in the plants, massive

21

renovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and

22

tubes that compose a central component.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What

I understand that, and I

24

think you may have the better of the argument on me on

25

the interpretation of the PSD regulations.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

But what I

Official

1

am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed.

2

They don't challenge the regulations when they come out

3

because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting

4

them in a way that they favor.

5

later, when it turns out the agency is using a different

6

interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.

7

MR. DONAHUE:

And then some years

Well, Justice Scalia, these

8

regulations were challenged early on and there was a -

9

as the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement

10

in 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that

11

proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely

12

absent from these regulations.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But could Duke have had a

14

challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations?

15

have reopened the issue at that point?

16

MR. DONAHUE:

Could they

They did in fact precisely that,

17

Justice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York

18

proceeding by the D.C. Circuit.

20

was to move away from the potential emissions test of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Duke didn't challenge

I don't want to jump ahead

23

to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about

things for several days.

We've wrestled with these

It's disappointing to hear you

tell us they're clear.
MR. DONAHUE:

They're clear in this respect,

12

they did not include an hourly rate test.

13

in the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument

14

that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a

15

challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations

16

because they don't say it, they don't provide for it,

17

and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn

18

on actual annual emissions.

19

EPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real

20

world changes in emissions.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

can you account for Mr. Reich's interpretation?

circumstances the increased hours -

He misapplied in quite sort of anomalous

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

I know you say he's wrong,

5

but if somebody in his position with his expertise can

6

interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show

7

that they're not clear on their face?

8
9

MR. DONAHUE:

We think that this Court can

resolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness

10

of EPA's construction of the increased hours exclusion.

11

What it can't do is certainly what the Fourth Circuit

12

did, which is to say that the PSD regulations must be

13

the same.

14

different in multiple respects.

15

challenge could have been raised, and certainly that

16

challenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals

17

expressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts

18

and interpretations of the regulations.

19

what a court is supposed to be doing.

20

They are obviously not the same.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are

And certainly that

Right.

That's exactly

In deciding whether

21

the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper

22

for a court to take into account that the regulations

23

must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD

24

definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS

25

definition?

I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory 8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

or regulatory construction.
Cannot a court give great weight to that in
interpreting these ambiguous regulations?
MR. DONAHUE:

Well, that -- they're not

5

ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold

6

that they have to be is certainly an invalidation.

7

the D.C. Circuit, of course, held that the statute

8

doesn't require identity as between the two sets of

9

regulations.

And

And we're not here on certiorari from the

10

New York decision, we're here on an enforcement action

11

in which a court leapt over the express limitations

12

imposed on it, declared the language of the regulations

13

irrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather

14

dramatically.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't think the

16

same argument has necessarily to be made, but the

17

question still before us is how you interpret the

18

regulations.

19

interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.

Let's assume that's just a regulatory

20

MR. DONAHUE:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

But in deciding that,

22

whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that

23

we're entitled to take into account the necessity that

24

the regulations comply with the statute.

25

are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the

And if they

direction that it seems to us would provide consistency

2

with the statute.

3

jurisdictional bar?

4

Now does that violate the

MR. DONAHUE:

No.

I have no problem with

5

any of that.

If the regulations are ambiguous, take

6

into account the statutory text, structure, policies.

7

What the court below did, of course, was say it doesn't

8

matter what the regulations say, these have to be the

9

same.

It forgot that in fact, these regulations were

10

very different.

The D.C. Circuit said there's no

11

statutory mandate of identity and that the -- and, of

12

course, Respondent was there in the D.C. Circuit.

13

was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence,

14

as the court called it, between NSPS regulations and

15

PSD.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the regulations

are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in

different ways and can change its interpretation over

time.

20

is that the agency changed its interpretation in the

21

context of an enforcement program.

22

premise, what is the -- what should Duke have done when

23

that interpretation was changed in an enforcement

24

program?

25

vires.

EPA had been -- and subsequent

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Donahue, were there

8

earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the

9

position that it took in this action against Duke?

10

MR. DONAHUE:

Well, in the WEPCO decision -

11

I mean, EPA has always taken the position that actual

12

annual emissions is the standard under the 1980 rules.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But were they, in fact,

14

enforcing that standard?

15

could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at

16

the time Duke started up its -

17

MR. DONAHUE:

So that -- you said that Duke

Certainly.

I mean, WEPCO was

18

an applicability determination.

That was in 1989-90.

19

Puerto Rican Cement was an applicability determination.

20

Duke instead, knowing that EPA believed that increased

21

utilization that is caused by physical change has to be

22

considered under this, as is prescribed in these very

23

detailed regulations, Duke decided not to do that, to go

24

forward, and it didn't, in fact, come to the State or to

25

EPA.

1

Of course, the increased hours -- I

2

understand the Court's concern about the Reich memos.

3

But EPA's construction of the increased hours exception

4

is completely correct under the plain language of the

5

regulations.

6

there was no question that not only was it consistent

7

with the plain language, but whatever Reich had said,

8

the express language of the regulations was as far as

9

the exception went.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals exceeded its

21

jurisdiction and misconstrued the Clean Air Act in

22

holding that EPA was required to define the term

23

"modification" identically for the separate NSPS and PSD

24

programs, and on the jurisdictional point I'd like to

25

address the whipsaw question, because in fact it's quite

2

reasons.

3

cursory 1981 statements from Mr. Reich, who was a

4

subordinate official within EPA.

5

administrator of EPA, the head of the agency, in the

6

WEPCO decision, the applicability determination, made

7

very clear what EPA's position is on the application of

8

the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this

is an annual tons per year test.

It's true that there are those ambiguous and

12

position beginning with the 1980 preamble.

13

He made that perfectly clear and it has

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But again -

Should a challenge

14

to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that

15

time, or would you have argued that's too late?

16

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, I'm not sure whether it

17

could have been brought at that time.

18

the matter is a challenge was brought on this issue

19

in -- to the 1980 regulations.

20

it, but General Motors and the steel industry did assert

21

in the 1981 brief they filed in that challenge to the

22

1980 rule -

23

But the fact of

True, Duke didn't assert

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, presumably

24

Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we

25

were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing came up and they are surprised by that.

2

you're saying it's already too late because somebody

3

else challenged it in 1980?

4

MR. HUNGAR:

Now

Well, they might have that

5

argument, Your Honor, except for the fact that the

6

challenge to the 1980 rules was stayed and was not

7

reopened until 2003.

8
9

In 2003, Duke and other parties sought to
reopen and were granted permission to reopen that

10

challenge to the 1980 rules.

11

issues in 1984 and a brief in 1984 challenging the

12

regulation on the ground that if EPA's interpretation

13

was correct and that it did not require an increase in

14

maximum total achievable emissions, as the NSPS did,

15

test did, they argued that it was invalid.

16

the very incorporation theory that they advance here,

17

that is the statutory argument that Congress was

18

required to follow for the PSD regulations the same

19

regulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had

20

followed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable

21

test.

22

the D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and

23

rejected that argument on the merits.

25

They filed a statement of

construction.

Yes.

adoption of the regulatory definition from the NSPS

12

program.

13

made by Duke in its brief in 2004 in the D.C. Circuit.

14

The D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument at

15

pages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 New York

16

decision.

17

That argument, the incorporation argument, was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why was that rejection

18

wrong?

Because this issue is still important to me for

19

purposes of statutory construction.

20

that when Congress says the word widget in this statute

21

has to mean the same as the word widget in the other

22

statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the

23

apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I

24

mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can

25

adopt regulations under one statute which regulations
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Is it conceivable

Official

1

say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations

2

under another statute that says it means something else.

3

I mean, to say that they have to mean the same

4

thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to

5

say they mean the same thing.

6

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, it is a fundamental

7

principle of administrative law and deference to agency

8

decisionmaking that when Congress adopts an ambiguous

9

statutory phrase and charges the agency with

10

implementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has

11

a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking

12

authority to choose from among the various permissible

13

interpretations.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course it does, but when

15

Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to

16

be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among

17

those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.

18

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor, because

19

Congress has not mandated, as it could have done, that

20

the choice of the specific interpretation from among the

21

permissible options must be identical across both

22

programs.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then it's meaningless

to say the definition has to be the same.
MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

Entirely meaningless.

The statutory definition is

ambiguous, but within the limits of the ambiguity it

4

6

permissible given the range of language that Congress

Think of it this way, Your Honor.

9

program, if we were talking only about the NSPS program,

But within that range the agency has discretion.
If there were no PSD

10

Congress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the

11

agency would have discretion to adopt different tests

12

for determining whether emissions increased for

13

different types of equipment even within that single

14

program, because the statutory definition is ambiguous.

15

The statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits

16

all approach and the agency in its discretion could well

17

determine that one emissions test is appropriate for

18

some types of equipment, another emissions test is

19

appropriate for other types of equipment, as long as

20

both of those tests are within the permissible bounds

of the statutory ambiguity.

do that.

The court is simply precluded from

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you about an

argument I think they did make?

I think they made this

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument.

2

explained well.

3

that a major modification is "any physical change in the

4

method of operation that would lead to a significant net

5

emissions increase."

6

is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which

7

leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of

8

operation or the production rate.

9

On page 26 of your brief, I think it's
You set out the regs and the reg says

Then you have little (iii), which

So that's out of it.

Now, the question is

10

what's in it?

11

think what they've said is, if you think about that,

12

we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical

13

change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but

14

just means you can run it more hours.

15

proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation

16

for years and years and years.

17

did thinking that was it.

18

If that's out of it, what's in it?

I

And they say their

Indeed, we did what we

And then after we did what we did, they

19

pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't

20

it; now it means any physical change, like you change a

21

nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased

22

capacity to emit more.

23

It's just you run it more hours.

Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's

24

not what this reg has been about.

And they made that

25

argument, according to them, very strongly and the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all

2

around and made some propositions of law that it's hard

3

for even them to defend.

4

All right.

Now, that's what I think, that's

5

what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the

6

heart of it.

7

And if it is, what do you say?

MR. HUNGAR:

There are several things, Your

8

Honor.

First of all the language of the regulation

9

simply does not support that interpretation.

What the

10

regulation says is that hours of -- a change in hours of

11

operation is not a physical change.

12

a physical change here.

13

physical changes to its facilities, major modifications,

14

sort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but

15

substantial replacements of physical equipment at the

16

facilities.

17

of operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any

18

relevance because it applies only at the physical change

19

step of the analysis.

20

Fine.

But we have

It is undisputed that Duke made

So physical change has occurred.

The hours

There has been a physical change here

21

regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not.

22

Therefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer

23

applies.

24

physical change that did occur resulted in a significant

25

net emissions increase.

The next question is whether the -- if the

Here it did under the plain

language of the regulations and under the test that EPA

2

applies.

3

mistaken to the extent one can discern what the,

mistake in interpretation.

6

administrator of the agency, the head of the agency,

7

made very clear EPA's position, the very same position

8

exclusion.

It is true that 1981 they were arguably

But in 1988, the

regulatory history immediately in the wake of the 1980

rules.

Because it seems to me it is very clear that the

2

understanding of everyone in the industry, outside the

3

industry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the

4

way up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply

5

under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in

6

the capacity.

7

would be an increase in the hourly rate of the

8

emissions.

and asked for a determination of applicability, and was

told categorically PSD applicability is determined by

The only statements that I

10

which I just quoted to you, says exactly our

interpretation. But even more powerful at least in my

12

view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the

13

State of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the

14

Region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that

15

amicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you

16

know -- how do you determine what is a modification?

17

You know does something that doesn't increase the hours,

18

the emissions per hour, constitute it?

19

Since the modification does not cause any increase in

20

the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual

21

emissions should be calculated.

And -

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think

23

Puerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem.

24

Because what you are dealing with there is the

25

elimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a
28
Alderson Reporting Company

replacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been

2

a modification under any -- I think under anybody's

3

theory, because there would have been an increase in the

4

hourly emissions anyway.

5

subject to the PSD.

6

the truth is it would have been fully -- the way that

7

decision came out would have been exactly

8

consistent with the way that they analyzed it.

9

So it would have been a NSPS

It didn't get analyzed that way but

JUSTICE BREYER:

The analysis which was

10

probably pretty much based on what they said, I think

11

was that the reason there was increased potential here

12

to pollute, was really because this change would permit

13

the plant to be run more intensively or more hours,

14

something like that.

question of involving you know, normal operations or

was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate.

But if you are saying what couldn't have been

anticipated was the argument you actually made to the

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes. Well, I think that, that

6

is precisely what we are saying.

But you know, Judge

7

Tatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong.

8

Because the interpretation of modification under NSPS

9

and under the regulatory PSD was identical.

The

10

regulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard

11

because if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know,

12

the modification, this is the NSPS definition -- I'm

13

sorry, better go back a page.

14

modification defines emission rate and the emission rate

15

is expressed as kilogram per hour.

16

absolutely clear that that is the NSPS --

17

Dobbs modification.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PHILLIPS:

So that is

That's the NSPS section.
That's the NSPS section.

20

Then you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the

21

PSD regulatory definition, and it comes right back to

22

emission rate, or the regulatory history that says the

23

emission rate as used in this provides is identical -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

applies when there is no SIP.

15

that, why would Congress have adopted the same word,

modification, as the construction trigger that existed

Because you can use the

What's wrong with that?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because by the time the

6

extensive regulatory history about the meaning of the

7

term "modification."

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think what's wrong

with it is that you could have achieved that same result

10

by simply not saying that modification in one program

11

has to mean the same as modification in the other.

you didn't say that, that would be the result.

Justice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the

part of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going

21

to do what you say it's going to do.

interesting argument, major modification is not a subset

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yeah.

And if the Solicitor,

you do it twice, and you do it in the context of an

entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement

6

this statutorily -- or implement this before the statute

9

they leave this language exactly in the way it is, the

10

only fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to

11

me -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Because the language,

13

I don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words

14

of modification are, it's a physical changing or change

15

in a method of operation which increases the amount of

MR. PHILLIPS:

is where it makes this specific cross-reference, because

if all they wanted to do was get that definition, all

25

they had to do was use the word modification.

Alderson Reporting Company

They

1

didn't have to use modification as defined -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Phillips, I want to be

3

sure I understand your position.

4

statutory text in effect says every regulation using the

5

word modification must employ the same definition, or

6

are you relying on a general principle that when the

7

same word is used it should be used in the same way?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Are you saying the

It's a general principle

that -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So there's nothing in the

11

statute itself that says that principle shall apply to

12

this case?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, but the general principle

14

is that if the same language is used in two different

15

portions, you presume they have the same meaning.

16

you go beyond that -- because otherwise, their

17

interpretation rendered superfluous the specific

18

cross-references to as defined in and as used in; and

19

while I know some don't like the legislative history,

20

the legislative history is quite clear that they had in

21

mind, and regulatory history as well -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When

Your answer is you

23

are not relying simply on the general principle.

24

not just that they used the word modification in one

25

place and the word modification in the other.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

It is

It's that

1

in the latter place, they said modification as defined

in the first place.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

It depends on which general

4

principle, I suppose you're talking about.

5

relying on the mere presumption.

6

stronger than the mere presumption.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not

I think this is much

But your reference of

8

modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the

9

scope of the statutory meaning.

That's not the same as

10

saying every regulation that is a modification must be

11

the same no matter what the program.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think if you read it in

13

context, when you recognize that what Congress was doing

14

is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a

15

regulatory scheme that was well established with very

16

specific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly

17

picked and chose -- I think that's the way to say it -

18

from the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these

19

and not take those, and has a provision at the end -

20

168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until

21

they get changed at some point, suggesting -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just be sure I

23

understand the point.

If instead of saying as defined

24

in X, the second statute had merely quoted the same

25

words that were in X, would your argument be the same?

MR. PHILLIPS:

presumption -

4

No.

It would not be nearly

We would still have a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying that if

5

you used the definition as defined in another statute,

6

that implicitly says all regulations defining this term

7

must be identical.

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know if I have to go

quite that far because I have more evidence than that in

10

this particular case, because I have the fact that they

11

say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just

12

a definitional point.

13

that seems to have in mind this regulatory background;

14

and we've been told by EPA that when Congress

15

incorporated modification, it really did incorporate

16

that luggage, baggage as well.

17

We do have a legislative history

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is very helpful to

18

me, because the government has accused you of abandoning

19

the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think

20

you're endorsing the court of appeals.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

I do endorse it.

The only

22

question I have -- I mean, I don't think that it

23

necessarily has to be -- that every word has to be

24

identical in the two provisions, but I do think they

25

have to be congruent.

And so, that's the strong version
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the

2

Fourth Circuit was.

3

The weaker version of our argument, which

4

gets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and

5

capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if

6

Congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in

7

two statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing

8

that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it

9

is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term

10

modification.

11
12

And the reason -

JUSTICE SCALIA:
using the same word.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

It's not just a matter of

Yes.

You're right.

It's a matter of a statute

which says it shall have the same meaning.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

They owe us some

17

responsibility to explain, how do you not follow that

18

course.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could they have said

20

that construction means both modification and then come

21

up with a new word, alteration?

22

says the term construction includes modification, so

23

I -- construction can be broader.

24

alteration, they would come up with a new term of art,

25

and add that -

Because the statute

with that?

argument.

6

but see, the point here is if they had done that, or if

7

they had done what they proposed in 1979, which is just

8

to simply redefine major modification to be

9

modification, then we would have taken that issue

10

I mean, that would have been a much stronger
It seems to me the better argument, and -

directly to the D.C. Circuit at that point in time.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you do have a brief

12

here.

You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which

13

is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions

14

Definition.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And throughout that brief

17

it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed

18

reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which

19

is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or

20

whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even

21

though you don't change the capacity of the machine.

22

There's a whole brief on that.

23

that whole brief, that what they were doing was

24

inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

So you already argued

The other side has not argued

2

trying to make, Justice Breyer.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

As being outside the

statute at that time, and you did.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, you have to put that

6

into context.

We're talking about a matter that was

7

closed for 25 years and then was reopened.

And this

I don't think it's the full argument that

10

we've made before this Court.

15

argument is -

16

And it was rejected by

But if you're arguing that as a

estoppel and it's not 307(b)(2), then -

So you are doing it as -

5

see, I don't think it -- I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s

Justice Stevens.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could you explain to

7

me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem?

8

is an action by the administrator?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

You said this

Because there is no

10

action of the administrator that we would challenge.

11

The only action of the administrator was the 1980

12

regulation, which we interpret as not changing

13

modification.

If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains

14

modification.

We have no quarrel, then, with what the

15

administrator did in 1980.

16

Then they adopt preambles to the subsequent

17

regs.

18

we're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an

19

enforcement action.

20

there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the

administrator.

administrator for us to challenge.

question would be, do we have some obligation -

I don't know how that's a

final action.

The filing of a complaint, as this Court

4

held in Harrison, is not a final action.

5

doesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out

6

there for us to serve as a hook.

7

minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to
