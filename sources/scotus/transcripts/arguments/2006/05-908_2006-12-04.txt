Mr. Korrell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KORRELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
In an effort to achieve its desired racial

12

balance in its popular high schools, the Seattle school

13

district denied over 300 children, both white and

14

minority children, admission to their chosen schools

15

solely because of their race and without any

16

individualized consideration.

17

of the Equal Protection Clause which commands that

18

Government treat people as individuals, not simply as

19

members of a racial class.

20

This strikes at the heart

This fundamental equal protection principle

21

was reiterated in Grutter and in Gratz.

22

question in this case is not, as the school district and

23

many of its allies suggest, whether integration is

24

important or whether desegregation is compelling.

25

central question in this case is whether outside of the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The central

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedial context, diversity defined as the school

2

district does, as a white/non-white racial balance, can

3

be a compelling interest that justifies the use of race

4

discrimination in high school admissions.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Korrell Do you disagree in general

7

with the Solicitor General's brief?

MR. KORRELL:

Justice Kennedy, we -- we

MR. KORRELL:

Justice Kennedy, I think the

3

answer turns on the reason that the schools have the

4

racial compositions that they do.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- there's -- well, we

6

can have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but

7

there's residential housing segregation, and it wants,

8

it wants, the board wants to have diversity.

9

MR. KORRELL:

10

that if, if the resulting -- if the racial composition

11

of those schools is not the result of past de jure

12

segregation -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

It is a new school.

It's a new school.
MR. KORRELL:

In that case, Your Honor,

16

Parents' position is that the Government can't be in the

17

position of deciding what right racial mix is.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it'd have to take the

19

three sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of

20

them equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it

21

would be using a -

MR. KORRELL:

Your Honor, obviously it is

23

not the facts of the Seattle case.

25

something similar to the, a redistricting cases.

Your Honor, school districts

7

can do many, many things through race neutral means that

8

they could not do with race discrimination.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But can they have a race

10

conscious objective?

11

that Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a

12

clear answer.

13

But can you have a racial objective?

14

to achieve balance in the schools.

15

I think that that's the question

You say you can't use a racial means.

MR. KORRELL:

That is, you want

Justice Ginsburg, our position

16

is that that is prohibited by the Constitution

17

absent past discrimination.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You would object, then, to

19

magnet schools?

You would object to any system that is

20

designed to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a

21

system that is more racially mixed?

22

MR. KORRELL:

Justice Scalia, our objection

23

to the Seattle program is that it is not a race neutral

24

MR. KORRELL:

Your Honor, it is certainly

2

difficult if race -- if racial balance can be a goal of

3

government, then it is more difficult to defend a racial

4

balancing plan as unconstitutional, or to attack one as

5

That is true.

repeatedly that racial balancing is unconstitutional.

Well, we have said it

repeatedly in contexts different from this.

13

point of the affirmative action case is that some

criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial

That is not what is happening here.

So why should the statements that have been

made in these entirely different contexts necessarily

22

that the analysis in the Grutter and Gratz cases is

entirely different from the analysis in this case.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, when you state

Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as

your brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit

that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand

it, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they

can choose, but there's a big difference.

similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and

The object of the people who run

this place is not to create a school better than others,

14

it is to equalize the schools.

15

in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that

17

would shift radically from year to year, preferences was

can say either in theory or in practice, that one of

14

In fact, if you look at the program and how

it operates in practice, the triggering critical mass

Counsel, if I could

you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools,

clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

think that those decisions are different primarily

17

because the resulting decision is not a racial

classification.

19

an overt racial classification, like you clearly do in

20

these cases, then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny

21

questions and look for a compelling interest.

22

instead you start with a race-neutral government action

that doesn't classify people directly based on race,

7

My humble point is simply that in the real

I would say that -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose it was faculty,

8

and the school district makes a deliberate effort to

9

have members of the white race and members of other

10

races represented in -- on the faculty of every school,

11

so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so

12

that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit.

13

That's their objective and they're using a racial

14

criterion criterion to get there.

15
16
17

Would that be impermissible, to have a mix
of teachers in all the schools?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

18

think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of

19

teachers that might be okay.

20

assigning teachers to particular schools and have sort

21

of racial quotas for the faculty at various schools, I

22

think that crosses a line.

the exact opposite way, and I would think that if you

got to the point, which the Ninth Circuit did on page

But

I would have

While you're talking about

the way, let me ask a practical question.

2

in Swann, this Court said that a school board,

3

particularly an elected one -- it didn't say that

4

-- "could well conclude that to prepare students to live

5

in a pluralistic society each school should have a

6

prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting

7

the proportion of the district as a whole."

8

radical than anything that's at issue here.

9

Then it adds:

Far more

"To do this as an educational

10

policy is within the broad discretionary powers of

11

school authorities."

14

opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration.

think about it.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question, of course, is

21

simply this.

When you have thousands of school

22

districts relying on this to get a degree of integration

23

in the United States of America, what are you telling

24

this Court is going to happen when we start suddenly

25

making -- departing from the case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Do you want us to

overrule it?

Why?

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

General?

If I could answer the

4

question, I think that the fact that you point to the

5

specific language of Swann is helpful, because the Court

6

there in dictum -- I think everybody would agrees that

7

was dictum -- said that you could achieve a prescribed

8

ratio.

9

side, of the Ninth Circuit, of Judge Boudin, with all

10

And that's exactly where the logic of the other

respect, that's where it takes you.

11

And I think anybody that relied on that

12

language in the wake of cases like Crosson, in the wake

13

of Freeman against Pitts, that said achieving a racial

14

balance for its own sake is not constitutional, and

15

Bakke and Grutter against Gratz, that all said that

16

racial balancing is verboten, I think those school

districts would have been misguided in relying on that

language.

MR. MADDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
When Seattle was last before this Court you

struck down a State law that prevented bussing for

2

integration purposes because that law prevented the

school board from seeking to provide the educational

benefits of integrated schools.

5

it was clear enough that all children benefit from

6

exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom

7

by preparing them for citizenship in our pluralistic

Could the -- could the government achieve that objective

by barring people from moving into Little Italy or

giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in

Little Italy if they are of Italian ancestry?

5

do that?

Could it

Absolutely not, right?

6

MR. MADDEN:

I would agree with you.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it would appear that

8

even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by

9

any means whatever.

And the mere fact that the

10

objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is

11

perfectly all right, although certainly not the only

12

objective in the world.

13

doesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?

MR. MADDEN:

The mere fact that it's okay

I would submit that there's a

15

fundamental difference between the circumstances you've

described and a school system which takes all comers and

is tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a

presents narrow tailoring problems.

not present narrow tailoring problems if -- if the -

And then as to those that live further away, we look to

the board wanted to preserve those.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the, one of

12

the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the

plan has a logical end point.

14

point in this plan?

15

MR. MADDEN:

What is the logical end

Well, the board actually at

16

every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it

17

was necessary to continue the use of race, whether to

18

narrow it, and eventually to end it.

19

in the joint appendix at 408, the superintendent's

20

testimony of the, simultaneously the measures that the

21

board was implementing in terms of resource allocation,

22

implementation of new programs, because they realized

23

that by diversifying choice, they could hopefully

24

achieve some of these same ends, not as quickly, not as

25

efficiently, but that they could achieve them.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think it is

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been indeed the entire trajectory of Seattle's

2

integration efforts since the first Seattle plan.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in Grutter we said, to

4

shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the

5

U.S. Reports, 539, "the law school's interest is not

6

simply to assure within its student body some specified

7

percentage of a particular group because of race ...

8

that would amount to outright racial balancing which is

9

patently unconstitutional."

10
11

And that seems to be what

you have here.
MR. MADDEN:

I think that the term racial

12

balancing has two significant meanings.

One is a plan

13

that does not foster a compelling interest.

14

a plan that is too rigid, a quota, for instance, that

15

might not pass narrow tailoring given the context.

And second,

16

In this case we're not after a rigid set of

17

numbers, and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers

18

for their own sake.

19

that had become diverse through integration efforts not

20

stray too far from the community's demographic because

21

we're trying to prepare students to live in those

22

communities.

23

The purpose was to have schools

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The problem is that unlike

24

strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources,

25

special programs in some schools, you're characterizing
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

each student by reason of the color of his or her skin.

2

That is quite a different means.

And it

3

seems to me that that should only be, if ever allowed,

4

allowed as a last resort.

5

MR. MADDEN:

The board here was trying to

6

distribute, sort out seats that were available at these

7

popular schools; and so it devised a system whereby

8

every student had the opportunity to be assigned to at

9

least one of those popular schools; and as far as the

10

record shows in plaintiffs' briefing, there's no

11

material differences between those -- those popular

12

schools.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have quotas for, for

racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?

15

MR. MADDEN:

No.

across town, to try to integrate those schools.

20

no longer do that, but it was also of the firm

conviction that it would allow students who wanted the

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so Are the students who are

attending those schools getting the benefits of

they're not, why are you not concerned about that, if

improving the quality of education in all the schools.

We do not mandate that a student attend a school for

require some trade-offs.

MR. MADDEN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Madden, there was a

10

question raised about your categories, that is, you have

11

white and then everything else.

12

that if you are looking for diversity, what was -- the

13

schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage

14

of Asian-Americans, but they don't count.

And it was suggested

15

What is your response to that?

16

MR. MADDEN:

Well, the -- the problem that

17

the board was addressing was principally a, a problem of

18

the distribution of white and non-white students.

19

-- as a generality, 75 percent of all non-white students

20

in the district lived in South Seattle.

true for all the ethnic groups except Native Americans,

22

who are a very small -

And there are no African-American students at

You would consider that to be a racially balanced

5

MR. MADDEN:

I would say if that

6

circumstance occurred, that that would be something that

7

the board would have to pay attention to and consider.

8

But the fact of the matter is that -

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Nothing under the

plan requires that, does it?

11

MR. MADDEN:

No, because the numbers in

12

terms of the distribution of ethnic groups, separate

13

ethnic groups and the benefits or impacts of the plan

14

were spread proportionately -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what is the theory

16

behind that?

students there or the Asian students or the Latino

18

students would not benefit from having African-American

19

classmates?

20

classmates or Latino classmates or white classmates?

21

How do you -- how do square that with your, your

objective of providing benefits that flow from racial

balance?

Is, the theory is it that the white

It is enough if they have either Asian

the ground, which was that we did not have that kind of

think that would be something the board would have to be

mindful of.

6

themselves quite integrated, that the movement under

this plan did not produce disparities for or against any

I was saying, however, that if that existed, I

of no abuse of that.

It seems like one but according

to the record, it's not an issue.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't defend the

choice policy on the basis that the schools offer

11

education to everyone of the same quality, do you?

12

MR. MADDEN:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

They offer -

13

the popular schools to which everyone had access under

14

this plan who wanted access, I think it's -- there is no

15

dispute.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that

17

different from the separate but equal argument?

In

18

other words, it doesn't matter that they're being

19

assigned on the basis of their race because they're

20

getting the same type of education.

21

MR. MADDEN:

Well, because the schools are

22

not racially separate.

The goal is to maintain the

23

diversity that existed within a broad range in order to

try to obtain the benefits that the educational research

MR. MADDEN:

Yes.

But this is not like

being denied admission to a state's flagship university.

12

I think for that proposition, I would cite Justice

13

Powell's opinion in the Bakke case where he was at some

14

pains to point out that a school integration plan is

15

wholly dissimilar to a selective university admissions

plan.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we look at the things

18

that Parents are concerned about when they're

considering where their children are going to high

school, we look at things like SAT scores, for example,

or performance on statewide tests, would we see that,

the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed

23

schools have similar test scores?

24
25

MR. MADDEN:

It depends on what school

you're talking about, Justice Alito.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

In this case, I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think the most important point to start with is that

2

there was no contention that there was any material

3

difference in quality between the five popular high

4

schools.

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we looked at

Garfield and Cleveland, what would we find?

7

MR. MADDEN:

You would find a reasonable

8

basis to perceive a quality difference between those two

9

schools, but this plan didn't assign any students to

10

Cleveland.

11

I want to take a moment, if I can, to turn

12

to the issue of individualized consideration, because so

13

much emphasis has been placed on it in the earlier

14

discussion.

15

It seems to us, first of all, that this

16

Court in Grutter said that not all uses of race trigger

17

the same objections and that the Court must be mindful

18

of the context.

19

or merit-based system where we adjudge one student to be

better than the other.

21

factors before we get to race, starting with choice and

22

family connection, and how close you live to the school.

23

This is not, as I've said, a selective

We do consider individual

But ultimately, this is a distributive

24

system which, as Justice Powell -- as I noted, Justice

25

Powell said in the Bakke case, is quite wholly
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dissimilar to a merit or selective-based system.

What

2

it seems to us is being suggested by the United States

3

and by the petitioner is a system that would force an

4

individualized merit-based review on any kind of race

5

conscious program, specifically an assignment to public

6

schools.

7

That rule allows the means to define the

8

ends; and it ends up, I think, defeating the purpose

9

that the Court had of not stigmatizing -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the reason that

11

our prior tests have focused on individual determination

12

is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to

13

ensure that people are treated as individuals rather

14

than based on the color of their skin.

15

this doesn't involve individualized determinations

16

simply highlights the fact that the decision to

17

distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and

18

not any other factor.

19

MR. MADDEN:

So saying that

Mr. Chief Justice, in Grutter

20

you said specifically that individualized review was

21

required in the context of university admissions.

22

this context, the kind of review, the specific kind of

23

review that I understand the United States to urge and

24

the petitioner to urge, serves no purpose, and it may

25

itself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the

objective here.

MR. MADDEN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me

is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can

14

get into the school that you really prefer.

some cases depends solely on skin color.

There are many areas of the

law, certainly in the First Amendment and the Fourth

21

Amendment, that have considerable flexibility.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But what about the

23

Fourteenth?

I thought that was one of the absolute

restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people

on the basis of their race.

You can pursue the

objectives that your school board is pursuing, but at

some point you come against an absolute, and aren't you

just denying that?

4

MR. MADDEN:

I think that in Grutter and

5

Gratz, this Court rejected the absolute and instead

6

described discretely, which we feel we need, and which

is why we are not urging an absolute position.

that we indeed comply with the requirements of narrow
