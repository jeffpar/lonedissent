ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. CAMPBELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

pleast the Court:
When an officer makes a traffic stop,

11

activates his flashing lights, he seizes not only the

12

driver of the car but also the car and every person and

13

everything in that car.

14

what Petitioner asks this Court to rule on, rule today.

15

This simple rule is not only firmly rooted in this

16

Court's precedence, it also protects police officers and

17

the liberty interests of everyone traveling on a public

18

State highway.

19

This unremarkable conclusion is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it wouldn't

20

apply in a taxicab, right?

21

erratically, the officer pulls it over.

22

passenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch

23

another cab, right?

24
25

MS. CAMPBELL:

I mean, the cab is driving
If I'm a

Whether or not you can get

out and catch another cab is sort of a separate issue,

but at the moment that the car comes to a stop you've

2

been stopped by a Government means intentionally

3

applied, and I believe you are seized at that point.

4

After that it may become a factual question with the

5

totality of the circumstances and it may be

6

significantly different from that, from the question we

7

face in a case like this where it's a passenger in a

8

private car.

JUSTICE ALITO:
bus was pulled over?

11

MS. CAMPBELL:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13
14

And would that apply if a

If a bus Everybody on the bus is

seized?
MS. CAMPBELL:

Once again, a forward motion

15

stopped by government means intentionally applied is a

16

seizure under this Court's holding in Brower.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you would have

18

no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal

19

case to assume that the officer was concerned about you.

20

Your view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd

21

think they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a

22

red light or whatever.

23

MS. CAMPBELL:

With all due respect, I

24

believe at that point what you believe is not

25

necessarily the dispositive issue.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

The dispositive

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue is that your freedom of movement has been

2

curtailed by government action.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, are you saying then

4

that in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is

5

stopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a

6

reasonable person would regard himself as free to leave

7

is a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends,

8

as distinct from when the seizure begins?

9

MS. CAMPBELL:

10
11

Exactly, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's no other role for

that test.

12

MS. CAMPBELL:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And I

13

believe that's the rule we apply with respect to

14

drivers.

15

because usually there's a directive from the officer

16

saying okay, you're free to leave, there's a clear point

17

where the seizure ends.

18

We don't normally formulate it that was

But -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but you're taking the

19

position that whenever you are in a vehicle that is

20

stopped, you are seized?

21

MS. CAMPBELL:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Exactly.

Yes, Your Honor.

In this case, is it correct

23

to view this as -- to view it this way:

24

officer approached the car, as I understand it, he

25

recognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator.
5

As soon as the

MS. CAMPBELL:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
And there would be

3

reasonable suspicion then from that moment on,

4

least a brief detention of the individual to determine

5

whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual.

6

So all we're talking about, the only period of potential

7

seizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment

8

when the officer sees Mr. Brendlin.

9
10

MS. CAMPBELL:

In terms of determining when

Mr. Brendlin was seized, yes.

11

for at

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- there -

In other words, any seizure

12

after that point would be supported by reasonable

13

suspicion?

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, except in this case of

15

course, it would be fruit of the poisonous tree, since

16

the State has continued -

arrest itself is still a product of the exploitation.

which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an

Well, Your Honor, I don't

have a case that has these specifics in it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a

I didn't think you did,

murders and so forth.

13

the search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence

14

is excluded.

But I'm just not aware of

What's your best -- what's your closest

to the cases that talk about searches incident to arrest

Thornton, I'm not familiar

I'll look it up.

MS. CAMPBELL:

Thornton and Knowles are two

cases that this Court has decided relatively recently
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where you talk about the rationale for searches incident

2

to arrest.

3

considered to be directly on point for the seizure issue

4

in this case, but in Knowles the Court held that you

5

can't search a car incident to arrest on a minor traffic

6

stop because -

7

They're not cases that I would have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

This was the

8

search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really

9

jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice

10

Alito was proposing.

11

which the officer did not have the authority to act and

12

he did, but it seems to me that once he has this

13

knowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the

14

arrest is proper, and the search as well.

15

There may have been a moment in

MS. CAMPBELL:

If I can divide this into two

16

issues.

17

and I am aware of no mechanism by which Mr. Brendlin

18

would be entitled to suppress the arrest itself, to not

19

be arrested on the parole warrant, or to get out of jail

20

free, so to speak.

21

than discussing whether or not the evidence that comes

22

out of this auto search which is a direct product of the

23

illegal stop should be admissible.

24
25

First we have the issue of the arrest itself,

That is a separate issue, however,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -

Well, it's a direct product

of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to me the search incident to the arrest is legal.

And

2

are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that

3

whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require

4

you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and

5

you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you

6

don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the

7

car.

You can arrest the person, right?

8

MS. CAMPBELL:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And So the arrest is legal.

If

10

the arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must

11

be legal.

12

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, I think we have to

13

look, as I said, at the purpose -- the rationales for

14

allowing a search incident to arrest are the need to

15

disarm the suspect or take him into custody, and the

16

need to preserve evidence for trial.

17

case he's arrested on a parole warrant.

18

what evidence in that car would be needed to be

19

preserved in order to proceed on the parole warrant.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this specific
I can't imagine

What authority do you have

21

that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on

22

the offense for which he was arrested?

23

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, the search incident to

24

an arrest is an exception to -- to the exclusionary

25

rule.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you have any authority

2

for the proposition you just offered?

3

MS. CAMPBELL:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The proposition The search incident to an

5

arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in

6

another case, depending on the charge on which he was

7

arrested?

8
9

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, if what we are talking

about is whether or not the exclusionary rule should

10

apply, we look to the purposes of the exclusionary rule

11

which is to deter unlawful police conduct.

12

officers to make a stop on a hunch that someone has a,

13

has a, has a warrant or whatever, we have essentially

14

reduced the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule as

15

it applies to traffic stops, as it has historically

16

applied to traffic stops.

17

If we allow

This is, this is not a new proposition that

18

if you stop a car and -- if you saw something in plain

19

view after an illegal stop, it wouldn't be -- it would

20

still be excluded.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but why -- why

22

doesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is

23

conceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was

24

making the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully?

25

if he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why
10
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to

2

the extent that he saw any evidence before him at that

3

point?

4

And I take it the plain view exception would

5

at least cover the, I forget what it was, but the

6

materials that were in the, in the passenger well of the

7

passenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a

8

source of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?

misunderstood me.

doctrine would allow admission of that evidence.

13

I wouldn't say that the plain view

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I realize.

If the

But we've

14

got -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice

15

Kennedy's questions brought this out.

16

choice here of two ways to look at the State action at

17

the moment of -- of the arrest.

18

would be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop.

19

Another way to look at it would be to say it was an act

20

of executing a validly issued warrant.

21

that they at least could lawfully have executed the

22

arrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there

23

was an arrest warrant issued for them and they could

24

lawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that

25

point.

We've got a

One way to look at it

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And you concede

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Let's assume that those are our two choices.

2

On choice number one the State, the police officer, is

3

acting someplace where he shouldn't have been.

4

choice number two, the parole violator, your client, is

5

in a place where he shouldn't have been because he

6

should have been arrested and he should have been back

7

behind bars at that point.

8
9

On

If we have a choice between those two ways
of looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose,

10

give the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest,

11

to the warrant which was issued by a neutral and

12

detached magistrate at some point?

13

then why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest,

14

but the seizure of materials which were in plain view at

15

the moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an

16

admissibility rule?

17

MS. CAMPBELL:

And if we do that,

Well, first, Your Honor, a

slight correction.

evidence that this was an issue issued by an detached

magistrate because what we call in California a Powell

do this, it's the reason we exclude evidence in general

8

when it's unlawfull seized, when it is the direct result

9

of a -- of a stop that is illegal from its inception.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, all right, but you're

11

simply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on

12

act A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully

13

arresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the

14

car.

MS. CAMPBELL:

the temporal proximity to the initial illegality.

I don't see where the interest would lie in,

or where the justification would lie, in our saying

14

we've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket

15

of the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the

16

lawful arrest.

17

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, Your Honor, I think,

18

actually I'm not sure that the driver in this case is

19

going to have a remedy.

20

case, first we have this officer who makes an illegal

21

stop.

22

warrant checks on both parties; he finds probable cause

23

to arrest Mr. Brendlin; he searches the car incident to

24

the arrest, even though the Belton rationale search

25

incident to arrest perhaps is a bit shaky in the case,

If we look at the steps in this

He continues that detention in order to run

14
Alderson Reporting Company

because Mr. Brendlin is in the back of the car, and it's

2

a parole warrant.

3

searches the driver, and if the evidence is, or if the

4

taint is attenuated, as to Mr. Brendlin, and this is a

5

lawful search incident to his arrest, I don't really

6

understand how the driver is going to have a remedy as

7

well.

And in fact -

2

Then you got another category of cases in

3

which there is no question that someone is stopped, that

4

a police officer can exercise control, and that control

5

if so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for

6

Fourth Amendment purposes.

the officer really is exercising control, so we ask the

question would a reasonable person in the position of

the individual stopped have believed that he was free to

that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about

That's a physical stop, but

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD E. ZALL

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. ZALL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

5

I'd like to respond if I could to Justice

6

Souter's point earlier.

The State sees this as having

7

two distinct components in a situation where a passenger

8

is subject to a, in a vehicle that's subjected to a

9

routine traffic stop.

First, you have the stopping of

10

the vehicle, the physical stopping of the vehicle.

11

our view that does not result in a seizure of a

12

passenger.

13

discussed, which is directed at the driver.

14

is the operator of the vehicle.

15

to that show of authority, under this Court's precedents

16

the driver is seized.

17

In

It's a show of authority much like Hodari D
The driver

When the driver submits

The passenger is not seized.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even, even when the reason

18

the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car

19

was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it

20

is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the

21

only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon?

22

You would still say that, that the show of authority is

23

only directed at the driver and hence it is only the

24

driver that's seized?

25

MR. ZALL:

Justice Scalia, the way I'd
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

answer that question is to say yes at the outset,

2

because the driver is in control of the vehicle.

3

necessity, the show of authority to stop if it's done in

4

a routine manner, as was done here, is directed at the

5

driver.

6

Therefore JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the right answer.

7

think you're being consistent.

8

You have to say that.

9

MR. ZALL:

10

By

I

You have to say that.

Thank you.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, consistent with that

11

answer, consistent with that answer, what we're

12

concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like

13

this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the

14

moment of the stop plus one.

15

the -- I take it you concede the question is would the

16

passenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that

17

situation feel free to leave.

18

hypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the

19

loudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is

20

free to go, and so on, absent something like that, what

21

is the argument that the, that a reasonable person in

22

the passenger seat would feel free to open the door and

23

traipse off?

24
25

MR. ZALL:

And in cases like this

And in the absence of a

Have you ever been stopped?

MR. ZALL:

The heart rate went

But -

But I was the driver, I was the

driver.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Don't you think that a

14

reasonable passenger at that point would assume that the

15

officer is in control and that, in the absence of some

16

affirmative indication that the passenger can go, that

17

he's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over

18

with?

19

passenger?

20

Isn't that the reasonable response of a

MR. ZALL:

No, Justice Souter, I don't think

21

so.

I think again, because the, the traffic stop is

22

such a common occurrence and in the overwhelming

23

majority of cases involving a routine traffic stop, it's

24

an investigatory stop of the driver.

25

reasonable for the passenger and the driver to see it
30
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that way, I would submit that if I am a passenger in a

2

car and I'm riding with somebody and they, and one

3

patrol car signals for the driver to pull over, I think

4

the natural reaction is the driver says, what did I do,

5

and the passenger says, what did you do?

6

think that's the natural reaction.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, I

The fact that the action

--

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but the policeman

usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car:

Stay in the car.

not feel free to immediately open the door and start

15

walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman

16

to tell me:

17

that the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the

car until the policeman investigates?

Policemen don't like people jumping
They don't know why they're jumping out

And I would certainly if I were a passenger

Well, I think, Justice Scalia, I

think if the officer did tell you to stay in the car -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, even if he didn't

22

tell me.

I would have expected him to tell me.

23

wouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell

6

down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car

7

door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away?

thought he had seized not just the driver but everything

Just the driver, the

in the car, too?

11

MR. ZALL:

Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I

think that if, if the officer -- our position is that if

13

the officer does something to the passenger to indicate

14

--

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm talking about

the suitcase.

I mean, a suitcase can't go

You're representing the

3

States all the passengers are free to immediately leave,

4

absent some further countermanding officer -- order by

5

the officer.

I think that's a quite surprising

6

proposition.

Now, we don't have empirical studies and

7

so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial

8

notice and I think indications from the bench are we

just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel

you have no social or empirical documentation for that

position.

MR. ZALL:

Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I

4

Rodriguez, with Royer, with Drayton, with Bostick -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But those are encounters

6

in an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no

authority to make the person stay, where here I think

you've conceded that there is legal authority to require

the person to stay where he was.

MR. ZALL:

Yes, yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

But I think the point is that if JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if it wasn't a seizure

what's the source of the legal authority?
MR. ZALL:

Well, again, I think, though,

15

that it's a question of seizable versus seized.

the police have the authority to make, to arrest him.

occurs when the police exercise some authority over you.

clear that the traffic stop is to deal with the driver,

24

whereas in the street encounter -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
38
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

If it's not, if the

Official - Subject to Final Review

opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they

2

stop the car?

3

MR. ZALL:

Then, Mr. Chief Justice, I would

4

say that it's a seizure that at the outset, again per

5

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, that the, the driver only

6

is seized at the outset, but then once the police make

7

it clear that their interest is with the passenger then

8

the passenger would not feel free to leave, and then the

9

passenger would be seized.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if they make

11

that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the

stop?

13

MR. ZALL:

Yes, I think it would sort of

happen instantaneously.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

They pull up

16

next to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger

17

and they yell over:

18

Pull over, Brendlin.

MR. ZALL:

So they direct their action, they

19

direct their attention at the passenger at the outset.

20

Yes, then I would say the driver is seized by the stop,

21

and then right immediately the passenger, the reasonable

22

passenger, would not feel free to leave and then he

23

would also be seized at that point.

24

back to the Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence.

there's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has

serious doubts whether or not the evidence is

is whether the passenger is detained.

All we've been asked in the question is,

MR. ZALL:

I concede that that's true.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

While the questions

15

indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who

16

cares, it's a lawful arrest.

17

MR. ZALL:

Well, I think that because it's

18

fairly clear that the arrest would, would remove the

19

taint from the seizure, that there would be little

20

reason to send the case back to the California Supreme

21

Court.

been argued here.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there's -

3

you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test

4

for determining when the illegal seizure has been

5

attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the

6

California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test

7

in this case.

8
9

MR. ZALL:

That is correct, but again I

think because the warrant is such a clear intervening

10

circumstance that has nothing to do, you couldn't in any

11

way say it's an exploitation of the, of the illegal

12

stop.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But don't we have two

14

problems if we go to that stage?

The first one is we

15

would be applying a test that was not applied by the

16

court we're reviewing.

17

I'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were,

18

on the general point about the significance of the, of

19

the arrest warrant, there are still going to be

20

questions about the suppression of the evidence because

21

there are going to be questions about whether the

22

legality of the arrest on that theory suffices to

23

justify the seizure of the evidence.

colloquy I had with opposing counsel about the

25

possibility of applying a plain view test here.

The

And one further point I'd like to make on that

22

is, would be to draw a parallel between a parked car

23

situation, in which the lower courts have uniformly held

24

that no seizure results when the police turn on their

25

lights and approach a parked car, and even when they rap

there is no seizure.

3
4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No seizure of a

passenger or a driver?
MR. ZALL:

Of anybody.

Lower courts have

6

uniformly held that, and yet that seems to be a more

7

ambiguous situation and a situation in which the

8

occupants' natural reaction would be to turn to each

9

other and say:

What's going on here?

Whereas again in

10

the traffic stop I think it's, it is probably the most

11

likely place that a citizen encounters a policeman, much

12

more so than a, an officer approaching me at an airport

13

and saying, can I see your identification, or

14

approaching me on a street corner, or, as in Chesternut,

15

following me as I'm walking home in his squad car.

16

Those seem to me to be more anxiety-creating and yet the

17

Court has held that those are consensual encounters.

18

And in the parked car, there's ambiguity

19

about what the police want, whereas in the routine

20

traffic stop there isn't that ambiguity, so there's no

21

reason why the passenger shouldn't feel free to leave.

have a liberty interest in free travel on the highways,

9

and because if we look at every case this Court has

10

decided in the last 20 or 30 years regarding when a

11

seizure occurs, the case of a passenger in an auto test

12

-- in an auto stop meets the test.

13

need a show of authority or physical control; in this

14

case we have both.

15

officer's show of authority and as a result the

16

passenger is, is subject to physical control, as a

17

direct line.

18

Under Hodari D we

We have the driver response to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What have we done in a

19

case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done

20

in a case where there is a warrantless entry in

21

violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's

22

apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does

23

not belong to the owner of the apartment?

24

is that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been

25

subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that
54

My impression

correct?

2

MS. CAMPBELL:

If the person has no

3

expectation of privacy in that suitcase that is correct,

4

Your Honor.

5

vs. Prouse that a passenger does have a privacy liberty

6

interest in free travel.

But this Court has recognized in Delaware

So it's a different situation.

7

Once again, going back to the Brower case,

8

the, there was some question about whether or not the,

9

the seizure of a bystander would be, would be a seizure

10

under the rule proposed by, by Petitioner in this case.

11

Brower talks about an entirely accidental seizure.

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

one, there was just the driver in the Brower case.

14

MS. CAMPBELL:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16
17

Well, but there was only

Yes, Your Honor.
There was no passenger as

I recall.
MS. CAMPBELL:

No.

But - but under the rule

18

proposed by the State if there had been a passenger that

19

passenger would not have been seized.

20

how this Court -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I mean in the

22

case it's just not directly on point.

23

are arguing about.

24
25

MS. CAMPBELL:

But if we look at

That's what we

Yes, Your Honor.

But if we

look at the case next in line case, the County of

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Sacramento versus Lewis case, there was a passenger in

2

that case who was struck by the officer in the pursuit,

3

and although the Court found no seizure it didn't base

4

that on the fact that the person was a passenger, but on

5

the fact that it was an accidental application of force.

6
7
8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that's just another

case that doesn't help us.
MS. CAMPBELL:

I think it certainly informs

the discussion, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what of the question

11

that was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for

12

the moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up

13

behind the car that's been stopped?

14

difference between the passenger -

15

MS. CAMPBELL:

What's the

In that case, Your Honor,

16

there hasn't been an intentional impeding of those

17

people's free, free movement by the officer.

18

officer has intentionally stopped this vehicle.

19

-- I don't think it's really, it's really far-fetched to

20

argue that it's reasonably foreseeable that automobiles

21

often have passengers in them, and there is certainly a

22

large body of statutory law at least in California that

23

shows that the car can be stopped for reasons related to

24

the passenger.

an intentional seizure of the car.

We are looking at

3

Just to address for a moment whether or not

remand is appropriate in this case, just to clarify the

procedural posture.

California did rule this, that the evidence seized in
