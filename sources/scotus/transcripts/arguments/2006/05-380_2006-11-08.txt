ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Congress held six hearings over four

11

different Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses

12

in determining that partial-birth abortions are never

13

medically necessary, pose health risks, and should be

14

banned.

15

congressional factfinding, those determinations should

16

be upheld as long as they represent reasonable

17

inferences based on substantial evidence in the

18

congressional record.

19

Under familiar principles of deference to

That standard is amply satisfied here.

The

20

evidence before Congress was clear that partial-birth

21

abortions were never medically necessary, and that safe

22

alternatives were always available such that no woman

23

would be prevented from terminating her pregnancy.

24

result, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in

25

furthering its legitimate interests that they were going

1

to ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred

2

the line between abortion and infanticide.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, couldn't

4

a similar record be made with respect to what is the

5

more common procedure, the D&E, that involves

6

dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb.

7

you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to

8

ban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning

9

apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with

So assuming

10

respect to what is the most common method for second

11

trimester abortions?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Justice

13

Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in

14

particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle

15

to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this

16

Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the

17

majority method of inducing a second-term abortion.

18

And I think in the same way, there is quite

19

a different situation when Congress comes in and tries

20

to deal with the primary abortion method in the second

21

trimester.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so I

Even though we are told

4

by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are

5

basically the same, they start out in the same way and

6

that the difference -- the differences are not large in

7

particular cases.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

let me make a couple of points in response to that.

I

10

think -- taken at the broader level first, I think there

11

is one very important difference between these two

12

procedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the

13

other to stand.

14

place in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all

15

abortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act takes

16

place when the fetus is more than halfway out of the

17

mother.

18

And that is whether fetal demise takes

Now, as to their suggestion, I think most

19

particularly by Respondents in the second case, that

20

there really is no meaningful difference between those

21

two procedures.

22

the record supports that.

23

this case, it's very clear in the district court opinion

24

that you have some doctors, and examples would be

25

Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska

And with respect, I just don't think
If you look at the record in

2

case, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&E,

3

procedure.

4

They go in, in each and every

And because they're trying to perform the

5

D&E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only

6

modestly.

7

testimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters

8

or two and a half centimeters.

And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his

9

Now, in contrast, you have other doctors,

10

and here the examples I would point to are two of the

11

Plaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson,

12

they, in every single case, set out to perform the D&X

13

procedure.

14

example, the dilation regimen that they use.

15

Dr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of

16

laminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much

17

greater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of

18

dilation.

19

And that has material differences.

For
And so

And of course, not only do they set out to

20

perform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform

21

different procedures.

reflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent

23

of the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment

There are different numbers for different

and in here, there are some doctors who think this is

safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.

3

And if you look at the -- sort of by

4

counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of

5

testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough,

6

it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases

7

and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than

8

there were when we considered the other case.

9

are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other

10

case.

11

doctors or what.

12

And there

So I don't know if you're supposed to count

My question would be, if this -- do we owe

13

more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress

14

than we owe to a State legislature?

15

I take it a State legislature is democratically elected,

16

and don't we owe similar deference to both?

17
18
19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

What is -- I mean,

Well, Justice Breyer, I

think you certainly owe deference to both.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I think -

Well, if we owe deference

20

to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I

21

think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that

22

was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the

23

statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it

24

lacked an exception for the health of the mother,

25

something that came from preceding cases.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

So if giving

Official

1

deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there,

2

and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if

3

the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we

4

reach a different conclusion here?

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, I

6

mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in

7

discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion,

8

which you wrote.

12

critical part of the opinion, which would be Section

13

2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this

14

Court did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the

15

D&X procedure was not, in fact, safer.

16

But this Court focused on what the

17

20

and four different times cited the district court

22

various eight arguments were made by the State in its

Now, I think if you compare the record

2

before the courts and before Congress, compare that to

3

what was before the district court in Stenberg, I think

4

there is a much more robust factual record here.

5

look at the Stenberg case -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you

General Clement, are not

7

some of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous?

8

example, there is a statement that no current medical

9

schools provide instruction in the procedure.

10

For

Now

that's clearly wrong, isn't it?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, specifically

12

what Congress found in that finding was that none of

13

them provided it as part of a curriculum.

14

what the record here clearly reflects -- you know, I

15

don't know that the idea of a curriculum -- I don't know

16

exactly what Congress had in mind.

correct, based on the curriculum.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Supposing there was a lot

23

of evidence introduced in the district court that there

24

were schools like Yale and New York University that did

25

include this as part of a curriculum, could the district
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court disregard that finding and make a contrary

2

finding?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think if the evidence in

4

the district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary,

5

I think that the district court could effectively

6

undermine that one finding.

7

anything turned -

8
9
10

I don't think in this case

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, on other findings,

is there a different standard of review of what the
district court found as opposed to what Congress found?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

12

would answer you this way.

You might first want to

13

isolate those situations where, if the district court

14

was addressing something, an issue that just wasn't

15

before Congress at all, but it's somehow relevant, and

16

makes factual findings, I suppose the district court is

17

entitled to the normal kind of deference on review.

18

But I think if you have situations, which

19

you have in this case, where the district court heard

20

some of the same witnesses who testified before Congress

21

and before the district court, and the district court

22

makes a different credibility finding than the Congress

23

made, I don't think that's a basis for the district

24

court to be able to overcome the contrary findings of

25

Congress.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I don't understand

2

Congress to have made credibility findings.

3

the -- I read the whole finding.

4

seven pages of findings, and I don't find a single

5

reference in those findings to the performance of an

6

abortion on a nonviable fetus.

7

the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just

8

inches away from becoming a person.

9

you can even find the word fetus in those findings.

There were six or

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Sure, Justice Stevens, I

12

think I need to clarify an important point there, which

13

is to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus

14

nonviable, because it applies to both sides of the

15

viability line.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

21

Justice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all

22

remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain

23

procedures without regard to whether the procedure is

24

applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when

25

Congress does make specific findings that the procedure
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's banning would have the effect of preventing a

2

lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born.

3

not -

It's

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt?

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Sure.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not preventing the

7

lethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be

8

performed prior to any part of the delivery, because

9

there is no doubt there will be a lethal act.

10

The only

issue is when it may be performed.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

The issue is whether -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes.

Because the issue is

14

to whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the

15

child is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of

16

course -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Whether the fetus is more

18

than halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand

19

in the procedure, are only four or five inches long.

20

They are very different from fully formed babies.

21
22
23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, again,

you're right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

When it's halfway out, I

24

guess you can call it either a child or a fetus.

25

sort of half and half isn't it?

12

My point is,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you not agree that it

has no chance of survival, in most cases?

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

If we are talking about

18

previability then by definition chances are it won't

19

survive.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, that's right.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But again, I don't think

22
23

that, you know, that anything in this act JUSTICE STEVENS:

Congress has made the

24

judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal

25

demise takes place before any delivery begins.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official

1
2

the big issue.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I'm not sure if it's

3

whether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary.

4

you know, the line isn't that fetal demise has to be

5

done before any delivery begins, but the basic point of

6

this statute is to draw a bright line between a

7

procedure that induces fetal demise in utero and one

8

where the lethal act occurs when the child or the fetus,

9

whichever you want to call it, is more than halfway

10
11

I mean,

outside of the mother's womb.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would it, would it be

12

lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus

13

entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to

14

keep it alive?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, in the

16

postviability context it would clearly be, it would

17

clearly be infanticide.

18

context, if you have a complete delivery but the child

19

isn't going to survive, I don't think it would be

20

infanticide to necessarily let the child expire -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. But I do think by contrast

23

if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know,

24

perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to

25

live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed

2

another statute -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, that's

4

not what this case is about, because I think you have

5

recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking

6

about whether any fetus will be preserved by this

7

legislation.

8

whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing

9

an abortion.

The only question that you are raising is

So anything about infanticide, babies, all

10

that, is just beside the point because what this bans is

11

a method of abortion.

12

because you just do it inside the womb instead of

13

outside.

14

It doesn't preserve any fetus

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsberg, that's

15

right, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's

16

interest in maintaining a bright line between abortion

17

and infanticide.

18

that line, even if you might think it has a temporal

19

line, in the sense that viability versus previability is

20

relevant, it clearly has a spatial dimension as well and

21

the best illustration of that I think is think about a

22

lawful postviability abortion.

23

the mother's health, there is a problem with her life so

24

it's a lawful postviability abortion.

25

anybody thinks that the law is or should be

And the way I would illustrate it is

There is a problem with

16
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't think

Official

1

indifferent to whether in that case fetal demise takes

2

place in utero or outside the mother's womb.

3

abortion, the other is murder.

The one is

4

And I think that just recognizes that even

5

in the postviability context you have a very important

6

line which is a spatial line, and that line is basically

7

in womb, outside of womb, and what Congress tried to do

8

in this statute is to draw that line and differentiate

9

between one procedure where fetal demise takes place in

10
11

utero JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if this case were

12

limited to postviability abortions it would be a

13

different matter.

14

majority of these abortions are going to be performed

15

previability?

16

But isn't it so that the vast

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's probably

17

right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would

18

make is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the

19

spatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with

20

respect to previability fetuses and that's true for at

21

least two reasons.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- I see what you're

23

driving at in terms of the procedure.

the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A,

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

It just wouldn't be a

question of the doctor's preference.

refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk

16

about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor

simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be

this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of

the area generally.

I don't know if you could just go to a district

judge and say I need an order, the judge would take -

3

would have to take many hours to understand that.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy, what I

5

think I have in mind principally would be a

6

preenforcement challenge that was an as applied

7

challenge.

8

something that there is in other areas of the law,

9

Steffl against Thompson is an example.

And what I have in mind, you know that's

But what you

10

would have in mind is a doctor who had standing under

11

this Court's abortion jurisprudence would come in and

12

say, look, in my practice I've seen that this procedure

13

would be particularly useful in dealing with

14

preeclampsia or placental previa or some condition.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't that already in

16

the record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit

17

and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts,

18

proceedings in those circuits?

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, there is an effort

20

to make that showing.

I don't think that it's been a

21

successful effort to make that showing.

22

if you look at the findings of the district courts in

23

these cases, two of the three district courts found that

there was no particular condition where the D&X abortion

25

was medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits 22

those findings.

In this case, the Nebraska case, the

evidence, you might have additional experience with

But General -- General

20

Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract.

21

Wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the

22

vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't

23

bring a preenforcement challenge as to that.

24

it's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a

25

combination of what the condition is and the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Maybe

Official

1

vulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see

2

how that could be tested in advance.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg my

4

understanding is even when you talk about an

5

idiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform

6

these abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a

7

year and they can identify those conditions and they

8

have names for those conditions and I think it would be

9

amenable to bringing a more as applied challenge.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General, do you

11

understand the scope of this statute to be different

12

than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg,

13

focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional

14

language?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I certainly do, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, and I think that this statute, unlike the

17

Nebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark

18

approach that is based in the text of the statute and

19

clearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the

20

one hand and the D&X on the other hand.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't it quite

22

independent of the anatomical approach that the health

23

exception is denied?

24

depend on the anatomical approach.

25

approach may well be an answer at the facial

I mean that's an -- that does not

24
Alderson Reporting Company

The anatomical

Official

1

challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example.

2

But the health excepton problem is not affected by that.

3

And the difficulty that I have with your argument that

4

somehow the health exception issue should be left to an

5

as applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and

6

it's on 938.

7

I'm quoting:

"But where substantial medical

8

authority supports the proposition that banning a

9

particular abortion procedure could endanger women's

10

health, Casey requires the statute to include a health

11

exception where the procedure is necessary in

12

appropriate medical judgment for the preservation --"

13

-- excuse me -- "of the life or health of the mother."

14

Now, your position, it seems to me, requires

15

us to do one of three things.

Either we, we overrule

16

Stenberg in that respect, or we, we find -- I don't know

17

how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no

18

substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face

19

of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the

20

Stenberg statement.

21

to be a tension between the showing of substantial

22

medical authority which occurred in the litigation in

23

these cases and the findings made by Congress, and under

24

those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore

25

the record in the cases and go with Congress's

Or three, we say well, there seems

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

apparently contrary judgment.

2

Which of the three do we take?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

4

take any one of them.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

(Laughter.)

7

JUDGE SOUTER:

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

Well, we would urge you to

Take all three.

No, but seriously But in fairness, I mean,

you know, we have an obligation to defend the statute.

10

So our first, you know, our first effort would be to say

11

we distinguish the -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but the problem, I

13

guess -- focus the problem this way.

14

opinion talks about substantial medical authority as

15

triggering this requirement for a statutory element.

16

That problem is not focused simply by saying Congress

17

made some findings and the district court made other

18

findings and Congress should prevail.

19

The, the Stenberg

The fact is the substantial medical judgment

20

finding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the

21

record in the district courts in these cases.

22

not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can

23

reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is

24

substantial medical judgment.

25

as you say we should defer to Congress, haven't we got

This is

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Justice

rebuttal, but let me try to answer it this way, which is

5

our way of looking at Stenberg is Stenberg really

6

doesn't address what you do when there are congressional

7

findings.

8

and Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest,

9

well, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that

10

would normally get you past a summary judgment, you

11

defer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when

12

you have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of

13

doubt that might get you past summary judgment normally,

14

you defer to Congress.

15

other.

16

and we would say resolve that tension, but when there is

17

congressional findings, something that you obviously

18

didn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the

19

congressional approach.

20

Let me just -- I'd like to save some time for

And there is some tension between Stenberg

And it has to be one or the

It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways,

If Stenberg means something contrary, that

21

even in the face of congressional findings that you have

22

to defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know,

23

kind of invert what would normally be the way of

approaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent

with this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and

The Government throughout this case has

know that in some practices it's quite frequent, in some

25

practices it's not as frequent because those are mostly

2

there's extensive evidence in this case, much more

3

evidence frankly, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, than there

4

was in the Stenberg case, of the, of the -

5

But on the other hand,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have just one other

6

question that, it's generally related to the first.

7

If there is substantial evidence that other procedures

8

or alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X,

9

alternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although

10

they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of,

11

of medical expertise, they are not available because

12

hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted?

13

was going to ask that same question to the Government,

14

because there is some indication in the record that

15

certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this

16

purpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question.

17

I was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.

18

MS. SMITH:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

I

Because it's what sir?
Because it's purely

elective and not medically necessary.

in the sense that the Government's argument that there

are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative.

attached if you don't use it in some instances.

More statements in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if we look to the

other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it

isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably

safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then

there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly

any in Stenberg, not too many.

-- there were in Congress eight

live witnesses that testified.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, so I'm left with

17

a record where I guess you have a subjective

18

characterization that there is at least as much evidence

19

in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress

20

supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case.

21

But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with

22

the finding?

23

MS. SMITH:

Right.

Well, the important

24

point, Your Honor, is that even if the Court applied the

25

highest level of deference under Turner, the findings
33
Alderson Reporting Company

would be rejected and must be rejected, as all three

MS. SMITH:

That's fine, Your Honor.

I've

lost track of my train of thought, though, I think.
I think what I was saying was there were
eight witnesses who testified live.
JUSTICE BREYER:

My question basically I

20

think you might have been going after is, I was saying

21

that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence

22

supporting your side in these cases than there was

23

before Congress, than there was in first Stenberg.

24

MS. SMITH:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But still there was a

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the

2

Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the

3

finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska

4

legislature -- what kind of legal difference does that

5

make?

6

MS. SMITH:

And Your Honor, what I would say

7

in this case, it makes none.

While it's an extremely

8

interesting academic question about the level of

9

deference that should be applied in this kind of

10

circumstance, here it really is academic because under,

11

even under the Turner standard, if applied in a way that

12

Turner actually applied deference, to carefully review

13

the findings in light of the evidence in Congress and

14

again in light of the evidence in the district court -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you this

16

question about what you think we should do.

17

thought the evidence did support the conclusion that

18

it's never medically necessary, it merely -- the

19

evidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor

20

has to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather

21

than the other because there are more risks involved in

22

one procedure rather than the other, would that be

23

sufficient to support the -- I can see the argument that

24

the intact delivery may have less risk of complications

25

and so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely
35
Alderson Reporting Company

If I

Official

1
2

necessary.
MS. SMITH:

Well, I think there is, there's

3

been some confusion about the word "necessary" and it's

4

been used sometimes to talk about whether there are

5

other procedures that could be used, as opposed to the

6

determination that it is the safest procedure that

7

reduces significantly the risk of very serious

8

complications, not the risks of minor complications.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess that gets

10

back to the point earlier.

11

the discussion earlier that this act is not going to

12

prevent abortions?

13

MS. SMITH:

I mean, do you agree with

No, not at all, Your Honor.

I

14

-- the issue of the scope and breadth of the law is -- I

15

think the evidence clearly shows that this is a very

16

broad law that applies to D&E abortions and, contrary to

17

what the Solicitor General said about the intent of

18

abortions, abortion providers like Dr. Vibhakar and

19

others, they actually, their intent is always to remove

20

the fetus as intact as possible, and the district courts

21

have recognized that as an intent that's covered under

22

the terms of the act.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What degree of

24

marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to

25

override the State's interest?

I mean, if you have

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent

2

of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of

3

the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to

4

override the State's articulated interest?

5

MS. SMITH:

I don't believe a marginal

6

benefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's

7

what we have here.

8

least 11 board-certified OBGYNs, from the American

9

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that the

The testimony from over, from at

10

reduction in risk is significant and that it reduces the

11

risk of serious complications, such as uterine

12

perforation, which can lead to hysterectomy and

13

infertility.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought your

15

submission earlier was that we don't have any record

16

evidence about how often the complications arise, so

17

it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference

18

is in terms of safety under your submission.

19

MS. SMITH:

We don't have a quantification

20

of the safety.

What we what we have is the clinical

21

experience of major leading physicians in the field,

22

fact, many of them have testified that they perforated

uteruses in non-intact D&Es and they've never perforated

25

a uterus in an intact D&E.

And that in fact is borne

out by the Chasen study, a very small study with very

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we could go back to

5

the first question that the Chief asked you, you said

6

yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain

7

line between the D&X and the D&E.

8

Congress could have written the statute that would have

9

insulated the physician who's performing a D&E?

10

MS. SMITH:

Is there a way that

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I think

11

that the blueprint that this Court laid out, that

12

certainly is suggested in Justice O'Connor's concurrence

13

in Stenberg, was rejected by Congress.

14

three statutes, that if they had included a health

15

exception, she thinks would have been constitutional.

16

They all include the word intact.

17

She references

I think there's another narrower

18

construction of the act too that is possible.

19

the word intact, reading in the word intact, it seems to

20

me, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute as

21

it is, but certainly Congress could have done that and

22

other States have done it, but Congress set out not to

23

do that.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Adding in

May I ask you to focus on

one particular problem that I think is implicated by
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg's question.

2

correctly a moment ago, and I think this is in your

3

briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is

4

that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if

5

they can, because it involves less risk to the mother

6

from, from acts performed inside.

7

case, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very

8

difficult for Congress to define a difference between

9

D&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you

10

If I understood you

And if that's the

understand it, to have an intact result.

11

Your brother on the other side, the

12

Solicitor General says there certainly is testimony to

13

the effect that that is not so.

14

to perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have

15

a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do

16

the D&E and not have a totally intact procedure.

17

That doctors who intend

Would you comment on what I think is the

18

factual difference between you and the Solicitor General

19

there?

20

MS. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

21

problem with the law is that because it's not limited to

22

intact, it would in fact cover the procedures that are

23

performed by physicians who intend to perform a

24

procedure as intact as possible but simply don't expect

25

that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. SMITH:

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I understand that.

Yes.
But could you start simply

4

with the factual predicate for your argument and his

5

argument.

6

the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from

7

basically different factual assumptions.

8

could you start by commenting on that?

9

You seem to be starting from, if I understand

MS. SMITH:

Yes.

Could you,

The doctors perform the

10

same dilation protocols whether they are going to

11

perform a D&E or an intact D&E, and that's true for

12

Dr. Chasen and Dr. Westhoff, who performed both intact

13

and non-intact procedures.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought the

15

evidence was that you're looking for a different degree

16

of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if

17

-- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're

18

intending to perform a D&X.

19

MS. SMITH:

It doesn't play out that way.

20

Doctors do have different dilation protocols, but they

21

are often looking for as much dilation as they can get.

22

On the other hand -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your submission

24

that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're

25

intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

the same?
MS. SMITH:

It varies by doctor.

For

3

example, Dr. Carhart uses the same dilation protocol

4

whether he's going to do an intact or a non-intact.

5

Other doctors might try to do more dilation.

6

doctors, importantly, can't control the amount of

7

dilation they get, so a decision happens.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the

Well, they may not be able

to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go

10

about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather

11

than more dilation?

12

MS. SMITH:

Not -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It can't guarantee results,

14

but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know

15

how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to

16

produce less rather than more, and hence come within the

17

safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?

18

MS. SMITH:

19

for a minimal amount of dilation.

20

to do another day of dilation, for example, that could

21

add additional dilation.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They need a minimal amount and they are

Can you tell us where to

look in the record for the evidence on that?

10

MS. SMITH:

Each doctor testifies about

11

their own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe

12

that's in the Eighth Circuit appendix.

13

-- portions of that testimony, and are cited more

14

specifically in the Eighth Circuit briefs, which goes

15

more into the factual detail, Your Honor, but I don't

16

have the cites right now.

The health of the woman,

21

would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth

22

problems that you bring up?

23

to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first

24

and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do

25

it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way.

Because then after we say

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about

2

overbreadth fade?

3

MS. SMITH:

Not if this is not limited to

4

intact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting

5

D&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to

6

circumstances where the doctor could prove that it was

7

in fact the safest procedure.

8

testify in trial, for example, that they refused to

9

describe even intact -- regular D&Es to their patients

And we've had doctors

10

because they believe induction is always safer.

11

those doctors, I think would still be at risk, and it

12

would put 95 percent of second trimester abortions at

13

risk in that case, to prosecution for performing a D&E

14

when you should have been performing an induction

procedure.

want to do.

interpret the statute to say that that is not the

prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from

prosecution in that case?

In this case I had an intact delivery and

MS. SMITH:

Are you saying that we could

No.

I don't believe that's the

19

line that could be drawn, Your Honor, because anyone who

20

does a D&E is intending to remove the fetus as intact as

21

possible, and always can have the intent to go to the

22

anatomical landmark that's here.

23

different interpretation that uses the "for the purpose

fetal demise at that point, rather than what the doctors

do, which is perform the action that causes fetal demise

in order to facilitate delivery of the fetus.

6

it's not to facilitate delivery of the fetus -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If that language was

So if

Well, give me one instance

8

in which your proposed interpretation would work in the

9

real world.

10

MS. SMITH:

Well, there are allegations in

11

the Congressional Record, for example, in reference -

12

in Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela

13

Smith, about circumstances where the physician actually

14

holds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause

15

fetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because

16

it's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the

17

woman's uterus.

18

under that interpretation.

19

And those circumstances would be banned

But I want to get back to the Turner point,

20

if I may for a minute, the issue of deference to

21

congressional finding.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, just on that last

23

point, I mean, we are interested of course in different

24

interpretations, but it just seems to me that your

25

interpretation would have very little practical effect.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. SMITH:

Well, it would -- it would ban

2

certainly a certain type of intact procedure that was

3

discussed, and I think is the image many people have of

4

"partial-birth abortion" frankly, that this is something

5

that's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of

6

making this procedure the safest for the woman, and

7

avoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and

8

hysterectomies, which are serious complications that

9

though rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and

10

life changing and disastrous.

11

high of any complications, but the complications when

12

they occur are, are devastating.

13

doctors are experiencing when they perform intact D&Es,

14

that they are not having these types of complications.

15

So the numbers are not

And this is what the

So -- if I can move to the deference point,

16

I would like to talk a little bit about deference to

17

congressional findings because there is significant

18

authority from this Court of course, saying that where

19

there are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the

20

Court recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the

21

Court must independently and carefully review

22

congressional findings.

23

findings that attempted to change either by findings of

24

fact or legal findings, that attempted to change a

25

constitutional standard.

And the Court has rejected

are simply unreasonable and not supported by the

actually relying on the preceding findings, it says,

6

"for these reasons, Congress finds that partial birth

abortion is never medically indicated," and then you go

8

backwards and look at the reasons.

9

findings that are not defended by the Government, that

10

were not defended by the Government witnesses and that

11

are blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them.

12

If you go to the findings themselves, the

The reasons are the

15

The Government witnesses

Their findings that partial-birth abortion

16

is not taught in medical schools.

17

that is simply not true, it's an integral part of

18

abortion training at major medical institutions like

19

Cornell, Columbia, Yale, NYU, Northwestern, etc.

It says that abortion, partial-birth

abortion is a disfavored practice among abortion

providers.

23

Of course, we know

That is absolutely not true.
And it says that there are no comparative

and non-intact.

It is still true that there are no

Turning back, Your Honors, to the health issue.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

Could I ask you just

one thing?

9

MS. SMITH:

10

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The statute, of

11

course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries.

12

How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?

13

MS. SMITH:

Not very common.

Not very

14

common, Your Honor.

15

where there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind

16

of a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal

17

anomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but

18

it's very rare.

19

It would occur in circumstances

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in giving your

20

arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I

21

couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the

22

total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery

23

situation.

MS. SMITH:

I'm sorry.

understand.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't know if I

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, my

2

understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are

3

already outside the mother.

4

MS. SMITH:

Yes.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the objection in

6

the feet first is that you want fewer instrument

7

passes and so on.

8

MS. SMITH:

Yes.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But in that case,

10

it's not the skull itself that is preventing the

11

delivery of the fetus.

12

MS. SMITH:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
So your arguments

14

about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't

15

that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as

16

well?

17

intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway?

18

Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the

19

fetus?

20

In other words, if you want as much of the fetus

MS. SMITH:

Yes, but these are circumstances

21

where the fetus can't be delivered.

22

Your Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the

23

overt act that takes place is -

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the point,

In the case of a

vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that your

10

argument is that there is always a constitutional right

11

to use what the physician thinks is the safest

12

procedure.

MS. SMITH:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

No, Your Honor.

I think the -

I inferred that from your

comments.
MS. SMITH:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

17

What, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the

18

appropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that

19

there had to be a substantial body of medical opinion,

20

an objective standard that in fact supports the use of

21

that procedure.

22

against protecting a woman's health with a concern of

23

unfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.

24
25

And that both, that balances concerns

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then, you think there

are instances in which the State can require that a
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

procedure be used, even if it's not the safest

2

procedure?

3

MS. SMITH:

I'm sorry.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MS. SMITH:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -

So then, the -

Yeah.
The obverse of the

7

proposition I put at first, it must be true that there

8

are some instances in which the State can prohibit a

9

procedure even if it is the safest procedure.

10

MS. SMITH:

That's true, Your Honor, as long

11

as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which

12

as you know, certainly the circumstance with the D&E,

13

which is 95 percent of abortions, under the Stenberg

ruling.

on that?

MS. SMITH:

Yes.

that.

20

procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden?

2

MS. SMITH:

4

burden.

5

some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the

6

safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue

7

burden.

8
9

And I was just following up to say that so, in

MS. SMITH:

No.

I understood Justice

Kennedy's question to be, could the State prohibit what

10

it thinks is not the safest.

11

ruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that

12

question directly, under Stenberg what the Court has

13

said is, the Court can ban procedures only where there

14

is not significant medical authority supporting their

15

use as the safest procedure in some circumstances.

16

perhaps I misunderstood your question.

17

And under the Stenberg

So

But the Court has not ever addressed the

18

question, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest.

19

I think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has

20

to be significant medical authority that in some

21

circumstances it is the safest.

22

argument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's

23

used in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of

24

the cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the

25

right to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10
11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let me make just a couple of points in rebuttal.

12

I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's

13

question, about whether or not there are going to be

14

alternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a

15

practical matter.

16

always be an alternative available as a practical matter.

17

The alternative will always be the D&E procedure, which

18

the district court in this case called the gold standard.

19

And the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that

20

their own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when

21

they set out to perform the D&X procedure, they are only

22

successful about 33 percent of the time.

23

in the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually,

24

even though they tried to perform a D&X, will perform a

25

D&E. And so all of the clinics that provide D&X also

And the answer to that is there will

53
Alderson Reporting Company

What happens

Official

1

necessarily provide D&E, because the D&E is what they

2

end up with if they are not able to remove the fetus

3

intact.

4

know, the induction procedure has to be done in a

5

hospital, but the D&X and D&E procedures are both

6

equally available in clinics, so no woman as either a

7

theoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be

8

denied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy.

So in every single case, there are some, you

9

I wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's

10

question as well.

11

the record on this dispute between us.

12

record is really overwhelmingly in our favor.

13

you to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this

14

side, 135a.

15

in every case because it would necessitate a second

16

round of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he

17

doesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment.

18

Dr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a,

19

he says the procedure would require greater dilation.

20

You asked for factual citations in
I think the
I point

He says he doesn't try for intact delivery

And if I could just finish on the citations,

21

Dr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the

22

time, 148a -- all of these are in the petition appendix

23

of the district court opinion -- Dr. Cranen explains his

24

procedure at 174a to 177a. Thank you
