Mr. Himelfarb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft

12

offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and

13

Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting.

14

That holding is incorrect.

15

incorrect that even respondent does not defend it.

16

Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his

17

violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not

18

a theft offense under the INA, not because the

19

California statute covers aiding and abetting and the

20

theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but

21

because the California statute covers a certain kind of

22

aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable

23

consequences rule, and a theft offense does not.

24
25

Indeed, it is so clearly

That theory is slightly narrower than the
Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reasons.

One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's

2

holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit

3

the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated

4

felons based on a conviction obtained in any

5

jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes

6

between principals and aiders and abetters and it is

7

ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a

8

particular case was not convicted as an aider and

9

abettor.

Respondent's theory would have the same effect

10

when a conviction was obtained in any jurisdiction that

11

obtains the natural and probable consequences rule.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Will you help me out on one

13

mechanical point?

As you probably know from your brief,

14

I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and

15

I'm just not used to it.

16

I'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable

17

consequences theory were used to prove, let's say,

18

ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out

19

as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate

20

charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be

21

the natural and consequences extension of aiding and

22

abetting so that there would at least be on the record a

23

charge of assault.

I had thought -- and I guess

24

And I take it that's not the case.

25

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I -- I don't think it is.

I JUSTICE SOUTER:

Otherwise, you wouldn't

have this problem.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, it is the case that

5

the aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what

6

is sometimes called the target crime.

7

the case that the principal has to then go on to commit

8

some other crime, a subsequent crime.

9

arises whether the aider and abettor who intended to

It also has to be

The issue then

10

assist the target crime is held liable for the

11

subsequent crime.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in any case in my

13

example of -- of theft, and the further offense under

14

natural and probable consequences being assault, the

15

only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted

16

would be a charge of theft; is that correct?

17

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It could be.

It could be.

18

But in the course of proving the aider and abettor

19

guilty of the subsequent crime on this natural and

20

probable consequences theory, there would have to be

21

proof that bore upon the target crime to show what his

22

intent was with respect to the target crime and also

23

whether the subsequent crime was a foreseeable

24

consequence of the initial crime.

I don't understand it.

Mr. Himmelfarb, does the

government urge that we consider the point that you're

now arguing and the other points?

Justice Ginsburg, but it bears upon the question of what

to the Ninth Circuit's holding that aiding and abetting

If the Court simply holds contrary

7
Alderson Reporting Company

is included in an aggravated felony, it will leave open

2

a very important question which we think the Court

3

should provide guidance to the lower courts on.

4

would leave open the question of whether that means that

5

there is some general Federal immigration law definition

6

of aiding and abetting with which the law of aiding and

7

abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction would have to

8

be compared in every single removal case, at least

9

potentially, or rather as we would submit, that Congress

it would still be fair for the government to argue that

wiser exercise of the Court's discretion would not -

issue raised in respondent's brief.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the only thing

14

that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a

15

theft offense in California is broader than the generic

16

definition of theft.

17

being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling

18

is supported.

19

considered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.

20

All of these arguments that are

I don't know why they wouldn't be

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we

21

don't read the Ninth Circuit's order that way.

We think

22

the Ninth Circuit simply reversed on the strength of its

23

prior decision in Penuliar.

24

Circuit clearly held the reason this California statute

25

was not a theft offense was that conviction under it is

And in Penuliar, the Ninth

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possible under an aiding and betting liability theory.

2

So insofar as the order relied on Penuliar, it was

3

saying nothing more and nothing less than that

4

respondent's conviction was not a theft offense because

5

it is theoretically possible he was convicted as an

6

aider and abettor and the definition of theft offense

7

under the INA does not include aiding and abetting.

8
9

Now as I was saying, I think it's important
for the Court to make clear what it means to say, that

10

aiding and abetting is included in the aggravated felony

11

definition.

12

respondent raises here, I think is important to keep in

13

mind, is not limited to the particular aspect of aiding

14

and abetting law on which he relies.

15

And this -- the type of argument that

jurisdiction to jurisdiction but even within

19

jurisdictions.

20

an alien or removal case arguing that because some other

21

requirement of aiding and abetting law in the

22

jurisdiction in which he was convicted is broader than

23

the more typical formulation, that even though he was

24

clearly convicted of, for example, murder, and even

25

though the elements of murder in that jurisdiction

Not only that they -- they vary not only from

So in the next case, you could imagine

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you're

4

ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question,

5

but I take it your rationale for not reaching these

6

other grounds would also apply to your argument that

7

whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant

8

was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the

9

charging documents.

10

That wasn't a basis for the Ninth

Circuit's decision either.

11

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's true, Mr. Chief

12

Justice.

Our main submission is that the Ninth Circuit

13

relied on an issue of aiding and abetting.

14

petitioned on that question and the Court granted

15

certiorari on that question.

We

16

The three grounds on which respondent relies

17

on defense of the judgment, even though they all vary in

18

some sense from the Ninth Circuit's ground, two of them

19

simply have nothing to do with aiding and abetting.

20

first ground is an aiding and abetting argument.

21

slightly different from the one, slightly narrower than

22

the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied, but we think

23

it's fairly included and we think the Court should

address it.

reasons I am attempting to articulate now.

If you have a jurisdiction with a law of

aiding and abetting that is broader, it can be

characterized as broader in some sense than what might

be thought to be the general notion of aiding and

abetting, under the premise of respondent's theory, you

6

could conceivably have this kind of argument in any

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if a particular

jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally

different theory of aiding and abetting?

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Is it simply

Well, Justice Alito, we

13

think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to

14

leave open the question that if at some point in the

15

future, some entirely novel radical far-reaching theory

16

of aiding and abetting were adopted, that would not be

17

sufficient.

18

there is any such theory in any jurisdiction; and I

argument as well?

Well, we think that that's

3

not fairly included within the question presented.

4

think that's just a -- accessory after the fact is a

5

separate crime

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We

Well, it may not be fairly

7

included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument

8

asserted to defend the judgment.

9

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

We think

10

that the Court could resolve that issue along the lines

11

we've suggested in our reply brief.

12

submission on that point is that the term -- the phrase

13

in the California statute, any person who is a party or

14

an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or

15

unauthorized taking or stealing, that in that phrase the

16

term accessory means accessory after the fact.

17

accessory after the fact is not included in the

18

definition of the theft offense.

19

California statute is broader than a theft offense.

20

It's our submission that the Court can assume that he's

21

right about that but still rule for the government on

22

the accessory after the fact issue, because whatever the

23

statute might say, he was charged as a principal.

24

the law is clear that somebody charged as a principal -

MR. HIMMELFARB:

How do we know that

In the appendix to the

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it

5

tracks the language of the statute up to the point where

6

the statute uses the phrase I just read.

7

So it's principal language.

It's

8

theoretically possible that he was convicted as an aider

9

and abettor because the law in California, as it is

10

elsewhere, is that somebody charged as a principal can

11

be convicted as an aider and abettor; but the law in

California, as it is elsewhere, is that somebody charged

as a principal cannot be convicted as an accessory after

23

they're all entirely insubstantial and could be rejected

24

quite easily.

25

think that the better course is not to address the

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't the better

3

course be also not to decide the principal question you

4

want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us

5

to take, which is that if there are minor differences

6

between what you might call the general law of aiding

7

and abetting, it doesn't matter.

8

wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind

9

of consequential liability is part of the general law of

Why wouldn't it be

aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief?

11

So that would be the narrower ground.

ground.

would not be at all unhappy if the case were resolved on

just inconceivable that Congress would have intended

Taking account of minor variations in

jurisdictions would not only have the consequence of

of establishing that someone was convicted as a

16

mentioned.

17

It would

The premise of respondent's aiding and

18

abetting theory would suggest that in any case, it would

19

be necessary for the immigration judge, board of

20

immigration appeals and the reviewing court, to engage

21

not only in an analysis of whether the principal offense

22

of conviction matches some Federal definition, which

23

itself can be a quite complex enterprise, but having

24

done that, it would then have to go on and compare the

25

aiding and abetting law of the state of conviction with
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some Federal aiding and abetting law.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In that former question as

3

to whether California theft is general theft, do you

4

propose the same rule?

5

minor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but

6

in what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what

7

the general national rule is, they should be

8

disregarded?

9
10

That even if California has some

And if not, why not?

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, we think that -- we

don't, first of all.

11

And I think no court would say that and we

12

certainly wouldn't.

But there's a very important

13

difference insofar as that type of comparison was

14

concerned between on the one hand a principal offense

15

and on the other hand aiding and abetting.

16

important differences are if you have a general

17

definition of the principal offense, whether it's a

18

theft offense or burglary, any reasonable framework

19

would contemplate that in a great many cases you would

20

be able to tell whether the alien before the court was

21

convicted of that offense, of the Federal definition of

22

that offense, simply by looking at the State statute of

23

conviction; and if it matches it, that's the end of the

24

analysis.

25

to look at the charging instrument and see whether that

The two

If it's broader, in most cases you'd be able

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person was charged with something narrower than the

2

whole range of conduct that's covered by the statute.

3

Under respondent's theory, if you were

4

to apply that same approach to aiding and abetting you

5

would never be able to look at the statute to see

6

whether somebody was convicted under an aiding and

7

abetting theory that matches the Federal definition

8

because every statute includes aiding and abetting, so

9

it's impossible to tell from the statute whether

10

somebody was convicted as a principal or an aider and

11

abettor.

12

Then if you look at the charging

13

instrument, that won't suffice either because the law

14

everywhere as far as I'm aware is that somebody charged

15

as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor.

16

So the only cases in which you'd be able to establish

17

that somebody was not convicted as an aider and abettor

18

are the unusual cases where there happens to be

19

something in the files of the criminal case that will

20

explain in some admissible fashion whether the defendant

21

22

That's the first important distinction.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The second -

So you would limit your

24

rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor

25

variations, just minor variations in the aiding and
19
Alderson Reporting Company

2

abetting definition?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

I mean, our

3

submission is that Congress's intent in enacting an

4

aggravated felony provision that captures aiders and

5

abettors was that minor variations in formulation

6

wouldn't matter for the reasons I'm giving.

7

ultimately a matter of Congressional intent.

8

So it's

The second reason why this is important is

9

because if you were to apply that rule to aiding and

10

abetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any

11

jurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and

12

abetting every single crime in the criminal code would

13

not qualify for aggravated felony status, because an

14

aiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the

15

criminal code and is a potential theory of liability for

16

every substantive criminal offense.

17

that in those, those broader aiding and abetting

18

jurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated

19

felony unless the government could somehow search

20

through the criminal files and find something to prove

21

that in fact the defendant was not convicted under an

22

aiding and abetting theory.

Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called

5

Do you know what the difference between

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, the theft offense

6

that covers cars under than this one in California that

7

I'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg, is just a grand theft

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

That's

14

right.

And as I understand it, that is essentially a

15

larceny statute, which encompasses a common law larceny

16

rule, which is that there has to be an intent to steal

17

or, stated differently, that there has to be an intent

18

to deprive the owner of the car, of the car permanently,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MEADE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

please the Court:

2

I would like to pick up on the point made by

3

Justice Ginsburg.

This case does not involve a

4

conviction under California's car theft statute, which

5

is Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal.

6

Rather, it involves a conviction under California's

7

Vehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious

8

conduct including liability with or without the intent

9

to steal and also expressly reaching accessories after

10

the fact, which the Government concedes would make it

11

broader than the generic definition of theft.

12

The question is whether a conviction under

13

this statute is a theft offense and therefore an

14

aggravated felony triggering the extremely serious

15

consequences of automatic deportation from the United

16

States, a permanent bar from the United States, and in

17

the sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2

18

to 20 years for illegal reentry.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend began

20

his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of

21

the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting.

23

MR. MEADE:

We do defend the judgment of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied.

because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that

5

is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical

treatment?

7

MR. MEADE:

As an abstract general matter

8

divorced from the facts of this case and divorced from

9

California law, we agree that aiding and abetting

10

liability is part of a generic definition of any crime,

11

including the theft offense here.

12

However, that's not what the Ninth Circuit

13

stated in either this case or in Penuliar.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could I ask a factual

I'm just curious.

If the Government's

23

question?

24

statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a

25

Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994,

2

and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in

3

1998.

4

how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent

5

resident?

How does that happen?

6

MR. MEADE:

Is that a mistake or -

I don't know the answer to the

7

question except to state that those two, those

8

convictions did happen in the years that you state and

9

he did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998.

10

I believe it was through a waiver provision

11

under the INA that that's how he became a lawful

12

permanent resident.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. MEADE:

He's not a joyrider anyway.

I would disagree with that.

All

15

we know in this case from the record is that he was not

16

charged with 487(d) car theft, which requires an intent

17

to steal.

18

which covers joyriding.

19

He was rather charged under a conviction

In my reading of the Government's brief, the

20

Government doesn't contest that joyriding would put a

21

statute outside the generic definition of theft offense.

22

Even in the Government's presentation today, the

23

Government suggested that in most States joyriding would

24

be outside the generic definition of -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then the Ninth Circuit

26
Alderson Reporting Company

2

as the taking or exercising control over property

3

without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of

They're wrong in your opinion?

MR. MEADE:

MR. MEADE:

Why not?

No, it's not inconsistent.

don't take the position that a permanent deprivation is

required, is required.

17

is sufficient, as the Ninth Circuit stated in

18

Corona-Sanchez.

19

that a joyriding offense is outside that definition

20

because it includes a brief taking with an intent to

21

return, and the last footnote of the Government's brief,

forth the requisite mens rea for theft offenses.

7

MR. MEADE:

shorthand for the generic definition of a certain crime.

10

But we don't rely on the Model Penal Code.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would you describe

12

the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or

13

aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence

14

of general law?

MR. MEADE:

I would say that the Model Penal

of accessory liability under California law.
108.51 expressly covers accessories.

The

22

Government concedes that if that term means accessory

23

after the fact, then this statute is outside the generic

24

definition of a theft offense.

25

accessory has only one meaning, and that one meaning is

Under California law,

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accessory after the fact.

2

3

offense and would provide a -- an alternate ground of

4

affirmance in this case.

5

On that ground alone, this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Meade, the Government

6

says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but

7

it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal

8

code would carry over to the vehicle code.

9

MR. MEADE:

I have two responses,

10

Justice Ginsburg.

First, there's a similar provision to

11

108.51 covering the taking or operating of an airplane.

12

It is in the penal code.

13

mirrors the language of 108.51.

14

Government would agree that the definition of accessory

15

under California law in the penal code would cover

16

499(b) for the same reasons it would cover under 108.51.

17

Moreover, accessory under California law only has one

18

meaning.

19

provision at issue, Section 32 and said accessory is

20

defined to be accessory after the fact.

21

time, the legislature passed other provisions which also

22

used accessory in that consistent way.

It is 499(b).

It exactly

So presumably the

In 1872 the California legislature passed the

At the same

23

The California Supreme Court as early as

24

1898 stated that accessory means accessory after the

25

fact and relatedly, accessory before the fact, the only
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other plausible meaning of the term, has no meaning

2

under California law.

3

So with all due respect to the Government,

4

accessory in 108.51 means accessory after the fact and

5

that alone makes a broad and generic definition of theft

offense.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's also the case of Sandoval which is also

JUSTICE STEVENS:

squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an

accessory after the fact on a general indictment like

this?
MR. MEADE:

No, none of them do.

They talk

3

about the general principle under California law, about

4

that a charging document does not necessarily control

5

the ultimate conviction and sets forth the test that

6

needs to be applied.

7

But on this question -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

-- it is not only that.

9

going the other way.

Well, the Government

The Government has authority

People versus Prado, "in the

10

absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must

11

be indicted and convicted as such."

12

information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as

13

an accessory after the fact.

14

MR. MEADE:

If you look at this

Well, we think People v Prado

15

supports our view which is a statute specifically that

16

allows for accessory liability on its face.

17

therefore, a person need not be charged under the

18

different accessory statute.

19

So,

However, to the extent this Court finds the

20

charging documents or ultimate conviction ambiguous,

21

which it sounds like some members of the Court may

22

believe it is, this is a question of California law, as

23

a first point; but moreover, the question here is

24

whether the Government has met its burden under Taylor

25

and Shepard.

And under Taylor and Shepard the inquiry
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

is whether it can necessarily be shown that someone was

2

convicted of a generic definition; and here, given the

3

ambiguity under California law, it can't be said that -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what do we do about

5

that?

No, you have no interest in answering my

question, but the question, it seems to me under the

7

law, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference

I imagine some very weird case that the statute could

And

they need to show is that all the elements are within

On round two, on the modified categorical

second chance to -- based on actual documents in the

14

Here the Government relies on the charging

document in an abstractive judgment, but the Government

does not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea

MR. MEADE:

I would acknowledge the

better position to consider a matter of California State

I'd like to also stress that if the Court

holding.

that expressly include accessories after the fact.

JUSTICE ALITO:

In order to agree with you

on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide

10

two disputed issues of California law?

11

accessory here in this statute means accessory after the

12

fact, and whether if somebody is charged under that

13

statute as an accessory, that has to be alleged

14

specifically in the indictment, or whether it is just

15

sufficient to charge the person with the offense.

16

MR. MEADE:

Whether

The Court would only need to

17

decide that first question, not the second question.

The first question is what is the meaning of accessory

under California law.

view that the Court need not send it back to the Court

of Appeals.

approach is outside the core of what this case is about,

That is sufficiently clear in our

MR. MEADE:

I do not know one way or the

other, Your Honor.

4

whether anyone has been prosecuted under 108.51 on that

5

ground, we also do not know whether someone has been

6

prosecuted under Section 32, which is the accessory

7

after the fact provision, or more generally on that

8

ground.

9

But I also note that we don't know

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if no one has

10

ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for

11

joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to

12

construe this charging document which charges him as a

13

principal as actually meaning to charge him as an

14

accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?

15

MR. MEADE:

Not necessarily, because what we

16

have is a statutory provision that clearly covers

17

accessories after the fact.

18

of someone who was charged under 108.51, but there are

19

many reasons why that may not show up, partly because

20

the charging documents don't need to so provide, in our

21

view.

accessory after the fact or a principal under 108.51 is

23

not so easy to distill.

Missouri, in the very case cited by the government,

The same is true with

So what, the government here is seeking to

10

hold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated

11

felony without the requisite mens rea, and something

12

that's a minority view of the states.

13

Just to put this into context, under the

14

natural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if

15

California passed a statute saying that in some cases

16

someone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea

17

of burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft

18

without the mens rea of theft.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your argument isn't

20

limited to theft offenses, correct?

21

across all of these areas in which the federal law

refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?

did X and the natural and probable consequence was

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would it be completely

11

inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to

12

say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of

13

potential liability such as proposed by the respondent,

14

which would exonerate him from application of this

happened?

17

MR. HIMMELFARB:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Well, we think Would Taylor allow us to

do that sort of burden shifting?

20

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well ultimately,

21

Justice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on

22

the question of what Congress's intent was under the

24

intent in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, and

25

every aspect of that decision was tied in some way to

Ultimately Taylor was a question about Congress's

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

Congress's intent there.
We think Congress's intent in enacting the

3

aggravated felony provision of the INA has to be that it

4

didn't intend that you would have these highly arcane

5

comparisons of some general definition of aiding and

6

abetting, which either would or wouldn't include the

7

infinite variety of formulations of aiding and abetting.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so your general rule

to accomplish your objective would be?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

It's the one I suggested

11

when I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this

12

Court that Congress intended to include aiding and

13

abetting liability in the aggravated felony provision,

14

and intended to cover whatever formulations were extant

15

in 1988 when the provision was enacted.

16

leave open the possibility that if in some future case,

17

some jurisdiction were to enact an extraordinarily far

18

reaching theretofore unheard of formulation, for

19

example, anybody who intentionally insists -- assists -

20

without regard to whether the person even knew about the

21

principles of criminal conduct, could be held liable as

22

an aider and abettor.

23

well be the case that a state, by adopting such a far

24

reaching theory of aiding and abetting, would in effect

25

forfeit the right to have any of the subsequent

2

felonies unless the government in the immigration case

3

could somehow prove that the alien wasn't convicted as

4

an aider and abettor.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think that, the problem I

6

guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory

7

of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that

8

there was a concept of a generic offense.

9

aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural

And when

10

and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that

11

regardless of what the actual count is, even on your

12

count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it.

13

And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore,

14

form an element of a generic offense when it is -- or a

15

generic concept of the offense -- when it is a minority

16

view.

17

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, even under our

18

fallback position, Justice Souter, under which you would

19

have to come up with some general definition of aiding

20

and abetting and then make a comparison with the law of

21

aiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction.

22

And even if it's, you know, 20-20 or 18-18 among the

23

states on this particular wrinkle in the law of aiding

24

and abetting, we think it is frankly dispositive in this

25

case, that it is the Federal rule, and my friend
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mr. Meade has not disputed that.

2

We think it's just inconceivable that

3

Congress would have intended that in a Federal criminal

4

case if you're charged with murder, you can be convicted

5

under a natural and probable consequences theory such

6

that you could conceivably spend life in prison the same

7

way a principal would, and yet you would not be subject

8

to the same immigration consequences as somebody

9

convicted of the principal offense of murder, and

10

indeed, that you wouldn't even be able -- the government

11

wouldn't be able to -

12
13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why didn't we simply take

the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, I -- in Taylor?

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

16

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think that one of the

17

problems in Taylor was that there really is no Federal

18

definition of burglary.

19

part of it is to some extent, the Court did rely on the

20

Federal definition in Taylor.

21

original version of the office statute defined burglary,

22

and it defined it in a generic way which was broader

than the common law rule.
