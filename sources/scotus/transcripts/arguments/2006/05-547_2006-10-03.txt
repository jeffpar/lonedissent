ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ

9
10

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S.

12

Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the

13

Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes.

14

"Punishable" is a key term.

15

remaining phrase, "any felony under the Controlled

16

Substances Act," clearly refers to felony violations of

17

the Controlled Substances Act.

18

"punishable" means "subject to criminal sanctions."

19

"drug-trafficking crime," under 924(c), is conduct that is

20

subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances

21

Act.

22

If that word is omitted, the

The parties agree that
So, a

State felonies are not, themselves, punishable

23

under the Controlled Substances Act.

It is not a Federal

24

crime to violate State law.

25

be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a

The defendant's conduct may

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

State felony is not a felony punishable under the

2

Controlled Substances Act.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do you agree that if

4

there were a State conviction for an offense that would

5

have been punishable under the Federal law, their both

6

being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that

7

instance, and that that does meet the definition?

8
9

MR. LONG:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

Our position

is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the

10

Controlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal

11

statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18

12

U.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an

13

aggravated felony.

14

But there are three additional textual

15

indications, in addition to simply the "felony punishable"

16

language, that misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled

17

Substances Act are not drug-trafficking crimes under

18

Section 924(c).

19

provisions of Section 924 -- (e), (g), and (k) -- where

20

Congress actually used very similar language.

21

to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act

22

or the two other statutes, or offenses under the

23

Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal

24

statutes.

25

The first one is, there are other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. LONG:

3

-- the implication is that when

Congress meant to include State offenses, it said so.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. LONG:

6

Where -

Where are those sections?

The -- you can find them; they're in

the appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. LONG:

Okay.

-- and the provisions on (e), (g),

9

and (k) -- 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e)

10

begins on 5A, and you can pick up -- (g) is on 6A, (k) is

11

on 7A.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. LONG:

14

What are the sections -- (b)?

They're subsections (e), (g), and

(k).

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that doesn't carry

17

too much weight, though, because the provision that -- I'm

18

looking at (g)(3), "violates any State law relating to any

19

controlled substance," can be broader than what's

20

punishable under the Federal Controlled Substances -

21

MR. LONG:

It -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. LONG:

-- Act.

It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the

25

implication is clearly that Congress was referring to
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State law when it meant to include State law.

2

-- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a

3

parallel construction; it's not broader.

4

the government would say, "Well, we're talking about

5

offenses."

6

"offenses" is actually a broader term.

7

I mean, the

I think perhaps

That's a little different from a felony, but

I'll mention an additional statute, which was

8

not in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H).

9

This provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a

10

"serious drug offense" as an offense that is punishable

11

under the specific sections of the Controlled Substances

12

Act, or an offense under State law that, had the offense

13

been prosecuted in a court of the United States, would

14

have been punishable under the CSA.

15

An additional textual indication is, it's agreed

16

-- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against

17

the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under

18

924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal

19

crime.

20

prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that

21

clearly refers to a Federal crime.

22

drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for

23

purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress

24

would have wanted to include State felonies in a

25

definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision

924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be

7

The definition of

that all concede applies only to Federal predicate

2

offenses.

And -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. LONG:

In -

-- the Government's interpretation

5

would significantly broaden Section 924(c) to include

6

Federal misdemeanors.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B),

8

what, in your view, does the first phrase, "illicit

9

trafficking in a controlled substance," add to the

10

reference to a drug-trafficking crime -

11

MR. LONG:

Justice -

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. LONG:

-- as defined by 924(c)?

Justice Alito, in our view, "illicit

14

trafficking" means any offense that has a trafficking

15

element -- that is, distribution, possession with intent

16

to distribute, manufacture --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But are there any trafficking

18

offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a

19

"trafficking offense" that way?

20

MR. LONG:

Yes.

They're -- most offenses under

21

the Controlled Substances Act are trafficking offenses.

22

There are a few that are simple possession.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- are possessory -- there are

3

"mere possession" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c),

4

but is it not the case that any -- if you interpret

5

"trafficking" to mean trafficking in the way the word

6

would be used in ordinary speech -- that any State

7

trafficking offense you can think of would have a

8

corresponding felony violation under the Controlled

9

Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way,

10

the initial phrase is superfluous?

11

MR. LONG:

I believe the Government has a

12

footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some

13

State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a

14

parallel in Federal law.

15

of them.

16

position, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking

17

-- any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or

18

not it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,

19

is an aggravated felony.

20

Soliciting, I think, may be one

So, I think there are, in fact, some.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And our

Let me ask the same question a

21

different way.

If -- since 924(c) includes some "mere

22

possession" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a

23

controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c),

24

doesn't that show that the way Congress used "illicit

25

trafficking in a controlled substance" is not in the sense
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much

2

broader, so that it can include "mere possession"

3

offenses?

4

MR. LONG:

The -- Justice Alito, there is an

5

argument -- it's developed in the brief of the American

6

Bar Association -- that, because illicit trafficking is

7

the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in

8

this category should have a trafficking component; and,

9

therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled

10

Substances Act that are "simple possession" offenses

11

should not, in fact, be included.

That is not an argument

12

that we have pressed in our brief.

We read the phrase to

13

say "illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable

14

under the Controlled Substances Act."

15

with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable

16

under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by

17

definition, that it is included in the category of illicit

18

trafficking.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, I would agree

But that's ambiguous.

That's

perfectly ambiguous.

8

Justice Kennedy, I don't see how it limits it.

And there

9

have been other cases -- Taylor is an example -- where the

10

Court adopted a single definition of "burglary" for

11

purposes of 924(e).

12

mean, it's a principle that has been applied in a number

13

of this Court's cases.

14

That applies the Jerome principle.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But has it ever been

-- when we get to that language, Mr.

Chief Justice -- and I do think it helps the analysis to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

first decide, What is the definition of a "drug

2

trafficking crime" under 924(c), the criminal statute?

3

Once you've decided that -- now, when you move back to the

4

INA, there is this language.

5

applies to an offense described in 101(a)(43), whether in

6

violation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign

7

country.

8

has to be an offense described.

9

money laundering.

The term "aggravated felony"

Now, we think that's pretty straightforward.

It

So, the simple example is

It -- the offense described in 18 U.S.

10

Code Section 1956, "money laundering," is an aggravated

11

felony.

12

can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense

13

described in 1956.

14

a broader definition of "money laundering," that can't

15

count, because it's not the offense described.

16

you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense

17

is described in 101(A)(43) is -- Congress picked up, in

18

its entirety and without any modification, the definition

19

of "drug-trafficking crime" in 924(c), a felony punishable

20

under the Controlled Substances Act.

So, a violation of State law or of foreign law

If States or a foreign government has

And when

21

So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute,

22

that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances

23

Act, the offense described is the felonies in the

24

Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the

25

misdemeanors.

And State -- if State law wants to call a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

-- something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a

2

felony, they can do that, but they can't expand the

3

offense described.

4

Congress did that, is -

The offense described, the way

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But are you saying it would

6

also include State trafficking offense, because it's

7

described in the word "trafficking"?

8

MR. LONG:

Yes.

I'm focusing on the definition

of "drug-trafficking crime."

It -- also, there's the

10

illicit trafficking piece of this.

11

State offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be

12

an aggravated felony.

MR. CROOKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would first like to address the Government's

22

contention that Mr. Toledo-Flores's appeal is moot.

His

23

appeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he

24

is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of

25

that appeal.

Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to

2

Mexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release

3

portion of his sentence, because supervised release is not

4

automatically extinguished by deportation.

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there's no

supervised release of people outside the United States.

7

MR. CROOKS:

There's no supervision of people

8

outside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is

9

still subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court,

10

and still subject to the conditions of supervised release

11

that are not dependent upon supervision.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. CROOKS:

Well, like what?

MR. CROOKS:

20

from Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in

21

prison.

favorable factor for him to get a waiver of

inadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant

10

And, in this case, we point to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have a case involving

11

standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of

12

standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the

13

conceivable.

And this seems to me an exercise in the

14

conceivable.

Nobody thinks your client is really, you

15

know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's

on supervised release in the United States, or is going -

20

This is just not the real world.

21

MR. CROOKS:

Well, my answer to that, Justice

22

Scalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal

23

of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is

24

expired.

25

v. Kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and,

And in cases like Lane v. Williams and Spencer

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

therefore, the Court had to look for collateral

2

consequences of the now-expired sentence.

3

consequence -- in contrast, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still

4

under the sentence, which is a direct consequence --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here, in

That depends on whether you

6

consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he

7

leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised

8

release, which is impossible once he leaves the country.

9

Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a

10
11

realistic consequence of the prior conviction.
MR. CROOKS:

But that argument could be made

12

with respect to a person who is in the United States, who

13

is subject to a term of probation where the only condition

14

is that he not further violate the law.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. CROOKS:

In that -

Well, no, because -

-- instance --- in that -- in that

18

instance, action can be taken against him if he does

19

further violate the law under the terms of probation.

20

point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or

21

the District Court doesn't extend to Mexico.

22

MR. CROOKS:

Well, that's true.

The

But if we're

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- you don't want to say

4

that your case is not moot because your client is going to

5

violate the law again in the future.

6

MR. CROOKS:

No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm

7

saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for

8

the U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court

9

retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release,

10

and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it is different, in the

12

respect that he would first have to violate the law by

13

entering the United States.

14

MR. CROOKS:

That is true.

But in most cases,

15

that is the only violation of supervised release for which

16

they are later revoked.

17

no different from a person who violates his probation by

18

driving while intoxicated or committing some other legal

19

violation.

And, in that respect, it would be

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In order for a State drug offense to be an

aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of the INA,

But the -- but the operative provision is

section 1101(a)(43) of the INA, and there are three

features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion.

19

The first is that the consequences of aggravated felony

status under the INA turn on whether one is convicted, not

21

whether they have committed the crime, and that's true

22

both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under

24

think it makes particular sense when you're talking about

way for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- for the INA?
Our point is not that 924(c)

3

4

it's that the immigration consequences of that

5

incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an

6

aggravated felony.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why is -So --- that?
Well, the ground of deportation

11

that refers to "aggravated felony" refers to someone who

12

has been convicted of an aggravated felony.

13

ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether

14

someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and

15

the enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone

16

whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for

17

a conviction for an aggravated felony.

18

that, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction,

19

and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of

20

conviction -- here, State law -- to see whether it -- to

look at the -- to determine the status of the crime.

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- if there is room for more

2

than one construction of this statute, it seems to me

3

unseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two

4

people who have committed the identical acts, one of them

5

is barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the

6

dispensations, and the other does, because of the

7

happenstance of the State in which they were convicted.

That kind of disuniformity in an area where the

make uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law

specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of

the interpretation that Mr. Long was --

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- presenting to us?

-- we think it does, for several

16

reasons.

First, with respect to the constitutional

17

requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform

18

rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship.

19

we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking -

20

we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in

21

the country.

22

Clause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel

23

Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been

24

interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct

25

under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and

This -

Beyond that, even where the Uniformity

2

exemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good

3

example of that.

4

The State-law homestead

But, going beyond that, with respect to the

5

issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established

6

uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of

7

identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other

8

instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was

9

actually imposed.

In this case, we think, with respect to

10

drug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform

11

standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has

12

to be a felony.

13

That's -- that is uniformity.

But the -- to answer your point more directly,

14

it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to

15

State law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform

16

standard of Federal law.

17

several subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is

18

set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief -

19

three subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the

20

sentence that may be imposed for a violation.

21

you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly

22

referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State

23

law for a conviction.

24

(g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was

25

actually imposed.

And, for example, if you -

trafficking.

when you put the whole statute -- all the -- all the

down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words "for purpose of

All right, Mr. Kneedler,

assuming that -- as I understand it, the answer you just

4

gave, your second point, as well as the point that you and

5

Justice Stevens were debating, turns, in your view, on a

6

definition, or a reading, of the statute that would work

7

this way: that if, under State law, the act were a felony,

8

but, under Federal law, the action was merely a

9

misdemeanor, it would still, for purposes of this

10

definition, be an aggravated felony.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.

13

strange, that Congress would have wanted a reading of the

statute that would turn its definition of a "misdemeanor

crime" into an aggravated felony for purposes of the

But, if

we're asking, "What is important in the mind of Congress,

that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way

Federal law deals with it -- i.e., in the case of a crime,

whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls

16

to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary

And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores

I should point out that in the District Court

20

Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight-

sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony,

I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to

think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ

20

MR. LONG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

In answer to Justice Breyer's question, Mr.

22

Kneedler said that a Federal misdemeanor is a drug-

23

trafficking crime under Section 924(c) if a State punishes

24

it as a felony.

25

never prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section

He said, "Well, the Federal Government

He said, "The reason is because of

924(c)(1)(A)," and the language there is, it has to be an

3

offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court

4

of the United States.

5

be prosecuted in a court of the United States for a

6

misdemeanor.

7

that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any

8

court, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a

9

criminal context, and that would significantly expand

But that language -- a person may

So, the Government is making an argument

10

Section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that

11

we cite in our brief that used the same definition of

12

"drug-trafficking crime."

The -- Mr. Kneedler also said that the

14

aggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer

15

to State law, but I read them just the opposite.

6

the Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes.

even when it's a generic offense, you would -- you would

10

still have a uniform definition.

11

consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies

12

both in criminal law and in immigration law.

13

there's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities

14

are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity,

15

uniform Federal law -- uniform Federal criminal law, and

16

uniform immigration law.

17

is arguing that -- is that States can banish noncitizens,

18

and can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a

19

simple possession offense a felony.

20

that a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons

21

that have little or nothing to do with immigration, and

22

it's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that

determination to States.
