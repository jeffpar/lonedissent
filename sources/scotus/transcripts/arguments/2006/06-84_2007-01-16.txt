ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

I'd like to turn first to the Ninth

13

Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its

14

determination that the case had to be remanded for

15

further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore

16

Petitioners' communications with their counsel.

17

this Court to find that there is no necessity for any

18

such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege

19

because summary judgment should have been affirmed in

20

this case.

21

We ask

Petitioners and their counsel, if you think

22

about what communications you might find, they could not

23

have known anything more about these statutory issues of

24

first impression than the district court did.

25

questions of law.

It's

And if the district court's opinion
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the

2

reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate

3

to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same

4

views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the,

5

of the FCRA.

6

The first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless

7

reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to

8

go ahead and look at privileged communications if the

9

Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made

10

self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.

11

And the first is that they read willfully in

12

this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several

13

cases where this Court has read the term willfully in

14

civil statutes to mean recklessly.

15

But this Court has said repeatedly that the

16

word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at

17

all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used

18

to determine whether it means with knowledge that your

19

conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations

20

are sufficient.

21

the other three that were at issue, Congress has used

22

the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean,

23

as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that

24

their conduct violates the Act.

25

And in this particular statute, unlike

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's also used in the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

phrase "knowing and willfully."

2

other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any

3

sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.

4
5

MS. MAHONEY:

That appears in several

Well, it actually says

"willfully and knowingly --"

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In one formulation or

7

another, but it combines the two words, knowing and

8

willful.

9

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, this Court, though, has

10

held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is

11

used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases

12

including Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully

13

means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and

14

knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts.

15

that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so

16

the term willfully when, again, used -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MS. MAHONEY:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

You mean willfully alone?

It Where -- where it -- where

20

it means what you think it means, which is knowingly,

21

that does not mean knowing the facts?

22

the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the

23

facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?

24
25

MS. MAHONEY:

If you mistake

Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the

phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court held that it meant that you knew that your

2

conduct violated the law.

3

reasonable reading here because if you look, there are

4

also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing

5

conduct, and that would require the conclusion that

6

Congress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a

7

less -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than

8

knowingly.

9

And that seems to be the most

And that's CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if you're

10

the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel

11

comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair

12

Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we

13

need to make an important decision about whether we are

14

complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I

15

don't want to know about it.

16

willfully violating the statute?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

That would not be

Well, under -- some cases have

18

suggested that there could be a willful blindness

19

instruction that would govern whether you define that as

20

knowing or not.

21
22
23

Certainly -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it doesn't have

to be actual knowledge?
MS. MAHONEY:

I think that the best reading

24

of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is,

25

that is everything but, you know, that really is 7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How about reckless

disregard?

3

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, conscious disregard is a

4

recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit

5

correctly determined that this should be interpreted as

6

a recklessness standard, this Court has defined

7

recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious

8

disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of

9

harm or in this case illegality.

And in these

10

circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk

11

of illegality because what the district court found is

12

that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute

13

were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and

14

having -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Since the term knowingly or

16

knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer

17

from that that willfully in that provision also means

18

something different?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

I think the way it's used, it

20

says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a

21

permissible purpose.

22

be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that

23

your purpose wasn't permissible.

24

using it -

25

Permissible purpose, that may not

JUSTICE ALITO:

And even if they were

I thought the statute says
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what the permissible purposes are.

2

MS. MAHONEY:

It does, but it doesn't

3

necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what

4

the statute said.

5

what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit

6

report from, from a credit agency.

7

importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the

8

term knowingly there can also be explained.

9

Because for instance, users are told

But more

If you look at Section 1681h, it actually

10

provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless

11

there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided

12

in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions

13

that are carved out in 1681n.

14

And so I think it was to make clear, I think

15

it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a

16

willful intent to injure.

17

be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law

18

there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just

19

surplusage.

20

have a willful intent to violate.

21

So even if they meant it to

It was to clarify that they didn't have to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would you say it's all

22

right to use the model penal code definition of

23

reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here,

24

you would have to consciously disregard a substantial

25

and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you come across anything

3

that would use that, I mean "reckless" itself is

4

unclear.

5

on this Court's opinions primarily.

6

MS. MAHONEY:

The model penal code tried to clarify it based

But I think you can look to

7

the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs.

8

Brennan as well, though, as well as -

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
MS. MAHONEY:

What's the difference?

The difference is just, there

11

is two forms of recklessness.

12

the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have

13

known, you could be -- you could be liable.

14

the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used

15

here in this setting, where there is the potential for

16

very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to -

17

Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal," the criminal

18

recklessness standard.

19

One which says that if

But that

And that means that not only do you have to

20

have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you

21

must be actually conscious of that risk.

22

case, you don't even need to get to the issue of

23

consciousness.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in this

Well, you said there is no

way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers.

2

They know there's risk that this is unlawful.

3

MS. MAHONEY:

The question is -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But consciousness, I mean,

5

maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't

6

know that that would help you.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

I think the issue of conscious

8

-- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk.

And if

9

it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or

10

even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is

11

fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of

12

success, then how can you say that is a high risk of

13

illegality, so high that we should say that Congress

14

wanted to sanction you for taking that position?

15

And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't

16

be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was

17

a fair ground for believing that it was lawful.

18

here what the Ninth Circuit did -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Suppose there is a fair

ground for believing it was lawful.

it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it.

Is that a willful violation?

14

These are not

And so in that area, it's much like what

15

this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a

16

case involving a willful violation of, or interference

17

with rights secured by -- by Federal law.

19

Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy

the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close

question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in

4

violation, it was a close question; it's okay?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think you would look

6

at the intent until you found that there -- there was no

7

reasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground

8

for debate about the question.

9

Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of

And at that point, Your

10

illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they

11

consciously aware of; what did they do?

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I must say that -- that is

13

not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating

14

the law.

15

MS. MAHONEY:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Well, I think in Screws You're changing it to mean

willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.

18

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think so.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, if I know that what

20

I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a

21

close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating

22

the law.

23

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, Screws says you

24

can't know the unknowable.

And if the law, if it's

25

really, truly an issue of first impression, you may
13
Alderson Reporting Company

think you're violating the law, but you -- you can't

know the unknowable.

important, because you can't, you know, put -- impose

an industry facing billions of dollars without any

And that's why this setting is so

Here we're talking about the potential for

Is it really billions?

How many of these have been certified as class actions?

9

MS. MAHONEY:

I believe that there are two

10

11

cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your

12

Honor.

But many -- there are many

Certainly if the classes are certified, and -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you, would you, as

14

representative of the insurers, would you have a sound

15

objection to class action certification in these cases?

would be some bases to resist.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

judgment?
MS. MAHONEY:

I do not believe any have gone

22

to judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the

23

point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or

24

the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every

25

consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

may have gotten a better price if they had even better

2

credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute

3

that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand

4

dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply

5

that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have

6

the potential for very, very substantial liability.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a question how many

8

will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation

9

costs.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, given that these are

11

proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is

12

plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys

13

to bring these class actions, and they have been

14

brought, and this is a class action.

15

class actions.

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are two

They haven't -- neither

has been certified, has it?

18

MS. MAHONEY:

19

putative class actions, Your Honor.

20

that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look

21

at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind

22

when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive

23

damages based on a willful violation in a technical area

24

where there is no potential for harm?

25

No, it has not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They are

And certainly -

I have just two, two

questions on, on willful and then -- because you may

2

want to talk about the other issue in the case.

you began by saying that here a district judge has come

4

to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be

6

that proposition, where we have said that?

Do you have any authority, where we -- for

That's my

And the second is willfully, as Screws

13

itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently

14

in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.

15

MS. MAHONEY:

Except Screws, Your Honor,

16

actually says that it was adopting a criminal

17

recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a

18

reckless standard.

19

has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully

20

in the punitive damages context.

21

And that is the same standard that

So I think it's exactly the same standard in

22

that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't

23

just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad

24

purpose to violate clearly defined rules.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals correctly concluded

21

that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here,

22

includes a reckless disregard component or a

23

recklessness component.

24

held in a number of cases that have similar uses of

25

willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have

That is what this Court has

18
Alderson Reporting Company

held.

2

three that have been most discussed in the case, in the

3

papers here.

4

Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the

But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here

5

was in the application of that standard.

And in

6

particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it

7

concluded that a creative but unlikely position

8

constitutes recklessness, it erred.

9

an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care.

Recklessness speaks

10

It requires that the defendant act in the face of or

11

fail to act -

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is a subjective

standard or an objective standard?

14

MS. MILLETT:

It has both in this context.

15

It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective

16

component, because there is -- this is a civil case.

17

It's not purely subjective.

18

component is very important because that is what makes

19

the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk.

20

There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that objective

So if the potential

22

liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to

23

be even more careful because there is liability so

great.

MS. MILLETT:

No, to the extent you're

3

talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's

4

true.

5

generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury

6

that could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk.

7

the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to

8

somebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree

9

of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you

I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness

If

10

know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or

11

maybe even a dollar injury.

12

And it's not set.

It's a variable

13

calculation.

14

that when we talk about a high and objective risk in

15

this context, we are talking about the dollars that a,

16

that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they

17

are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers.

18

So in that sense, it is.

I don't think

What we are talking about here -- and this

19

is a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the

20

liability itself, not just the damages, but the

21

liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from

22

law.

23

there is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes

24

for just a violation.

25

You have to -- there is no recovery here like

That isn't it.

You have to show either a willful violation
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

or a negligent violation, and that requires a

2

determination not only that the defendants violated the

3

law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how

4

many standard deviations from correct their position was

5

and that is an objective determination.

6

Once an objectively high risk has been found

7

by a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking

8

into subjective things.

9

entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has

I think a plaintiff would be

10

been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a

11

jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to

12

infer the existence of willfulness from that.

13

that's often when defendants -- I'm sorry.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct me if I'm

20

wrong.

You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm

21

paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and

22

they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your

23

rates, that's an adverse action because they might have

24

lowered the rates even further if they had notified me

25

about the credit report and there were some errors in
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it?

2

MS. MILLETT:

Right.

It's a complicated

3

answer, in part because that assumes that you have an

4

existing account and you're not an initial account here.

5

And when you have an existing account, there's a

6

definition of adverse action for insurance provisions,

7

but in iv there is a separate, there's another

8

definition, and this is on, on page -- sorry.

9

me.

Excuse

On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under

10

big I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks

11

about reviewing an existing account, and it

12

cross-referenced another provision which talks about

13

reviewing an account for purposes of termination.

14

that would include, in our view, not only completely

15

canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging

16

you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate.

17

which would govern in that particular context is a

18

little bit harder.

19

And

So

But it could, and here's logically why,

20

because I think the understanding of "increase" that's

21

at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation

22

of this statute, and that is, did the content of your

23

information in your credit report, if it had been

24

better, could you have had a better rate or a better

25

deal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MS. MILLETT:

3

Right.

So have you been hit in the

pocketbook.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if they lower, if

5

they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the

6

meaning of adverse action because they might have

7

lowered them further if the information hadn't been

8

erroneous?

9

MS. MILLETT:

10

this sense, it could be:

11

of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the

12

hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get

13

a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off,

14

but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of

15

my gender or because of my credit report, it's an

adverse action.

And

then it says an increase is -- and if you take an

change in the terms.

MS. MILLETT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean unfavorable change

Exactly.
Well, suppose you don't

before.

17

There's no change in terms.
MS. MILLETT:

If you're a new customer -

18

and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to

19

existing accounts is complicated -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean those words

21

"change in terms" refer to rates, in other words?

22

That's a rather odd way to refer to it.

23

you refer to an "increase"; in the other place, you'd

24

refer to it as a "change in terms."

odd way to write a statute.

send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to

send notices whenever you read a credit report.

think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's

basically the argument.

16

And it can't be that the statute intends you to

So what's your response?
And Justice Breyer, my

17

response is that if the content of the information in

your credit report would have made you -- had it been

better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a

20

better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as

hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the

question, it's important to read "adverse action" in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10

Thank you.

MR. SHORR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

When Congress intended to require a knowing

12

violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly

13

said so.

14

here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A).

15

where Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher

16

mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with

17

liability that was greater.

18

rea for the criminal provision.

19

mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages

20

that are available under the act.

21

It did not do so in connection with the claims

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In each instance

They required knowing mens
They required knowing

What do you say to the

22

argument from drafting history that looks at the history

23

both of little n and little o and it points out that as

24

originally, in the original bill, little o providing for

25

the actual damages required a finding of gross
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

negligence?

Little n used the word "willful" just as it

2

does now, suggesting that willful would not include

3

gross negligence or something close to gross negligence

4

like recklessness.

5

standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but

6

they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed

7

whatever it always was, and if the argument from

8

contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than

9

reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was

Then in, then in o, they changed the

10

changed to negligence in o.

11

argument?

12

MR. SHORR:

What do you say to that

Justice Souther, I think the

13

only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the

14

culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence

15

to negligence.

16

willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.

17

I don't think that tells us much about

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the fact that they had

18

originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the

19

original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about

20

what they had in mind in n.

21

something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n

22

which was a standard higher than gross negligence.

23

MR. SHORR:

And they must have had

No, Justice Souter, I suggest

24

that what you can infer from that is that, if anything,

25

is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or

2

reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence

3

in that circumstance.

4

separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful"

5

had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases

6

involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless

7

disregard.

8
9

But that still doesn't tell us

And I respectfully disagree with JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I mean, there's no

question it has been and that is sort of the usual

10

reading in the civil context.

11

repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many

12

meanings and you always look to the context.

13

the argument is that if you look to the context of the,

14

of the two statutory sections right up next to each

15

other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful"

16

means.

17

MR. SHORR:

But we also keep

And here

I think if anything, Justice

18

Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory

19

terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly

20

required the knowing standard and that's a knowing

21

violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed

22

to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose.

23

statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is

24

under this law.

25

And the

So that reference to knowing could not refer
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to a knowing, knowing the facts.

2

in some sense always includes some knowledge of the

3

factual circumstances.

4

And of course, willful

In addition, the logical structure of the

5

act -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual

6

damages.

7

reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but

8

then an even higher level for the criminal and higher

9

statutory penalty provisions.

We have a reckless standard, a knowing or

And as I started to say,

10

a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely

11

consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term

12

in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about

13

the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and

14

McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and

15

other similar cases.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, even if

17

you're right about the standard, how can you suggest

18

that it's willful here when you have no judicial

19

construction, you have no administrative construction,

20

you have the statutory language that at least the

21

questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly

22

clear?

companies on this case even under your standard was

24

willful?

How can you suggest that the action of the

MR. SHORR:

Mr. Chief Justice, of course we
31

Alderson Reporting Company

1

believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not

2

need further interpretation by the Court.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we don't agree

4

with you on that, you would lose on the application of

5

the willfulness standard?

6

MR. SHORR:

If you don't agree with us -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words,

8

your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful

9

violation depends upon your assertion that the statute

10

is perfectly clear?

11

MR. SHORR:

I think that there is a level of

12

objective component that the statute at least has to be

13

understood by a reasonable person at some level using

14

standard statutory construction.

15

suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a

higher court or even a district court for counsel to get

guidance.

the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district

12

that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor.

13

In a -- I guess I'll address quickly your

14

question.

15

FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was

16

16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that

17

instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and

18

comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined

19

very broadly and it includes any action that can even be

20

considered to have a negative impact.

21

the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your

22

question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory

23

language -

24
25

There's additional guidance provided by the

an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a

product to buy and there's the best rate, and they

That's true, and it's a

14

discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate.

15

decreased it.

16

MR. SHORR:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

You

I think It's still a

discrimination, it's still unlawful.
MR. SHORR:

Applying it to credit, a natural

20

definition that is charging someone more than you charge

21

others is an increase.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you say more, in order

23

for there to be an adverse action there has to be an

24

increase or an unfavorable change.

25

initial application you have to figure out what is the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

And when you have an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

baseline in order to determine whether there has been an

2

increase or an adverse action.

3

Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that

4

situation is the best possible rate that you can get,

5

but I don't understand where that comes from.

6

MR. SHORR:

And you and the

Because charging someone more

7

than someone else who qualifies for that better rate

8

based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them

9

more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose,

10

which I think was a question you asked -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me look at the

12

language.

13

English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase,

14

but maybe there is a technical term in the technical

15

language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word

16

increase means decrease.

And if you -- is there

17

anything you want -- no.

It's a serious question, at

18

least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses

19

this word increase in the way you just suggested.

20

Go back to give me -- because in ordinary

MR. SHORR:

We believe that it's a standard

21

dictionary definition, to charge someone more for

22

insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is

23

increasing their charge.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which dictionary shall I

look at?

MR. SHORR:
dictionary.

3

I think we can look at any

I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but JUSTICE SOUTER:

They're making this

4

argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago

5

when you alluded to statutory purpose.

6

what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong.

7

purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the

8

consumer's credit report may contain errors which are

9

doing the consumer some kind of damage.

10

MR. SHORR:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think this is
One

Yes, Your Honor.
And you want this consumer

12

alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and

13

correct it if possible.

14

MR. SHORR:

That's exactly right.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Reading the adverse action

16

the way you read it, it would give the consumer or

17

consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases.

18

every case in which the consumer might have done better

19

if the credit report had assumed different facts, on

20

your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say

21

I want to look at that report and correct it if it's

22

wrong.

23

fallacy of saying because that is one object of the

24

statute, every term within the statute has got to be

25

read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that

But isn't the fallacy of that argument the

39
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

object?

And the trouble that we're having on the bench

2

is that discrimination and increase are different terms.

3

Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline

4

that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination

5

does not.

6

discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that

7

the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the

8

basis of your argument?

9

And your reading in effect, increase to mean

MR. SHORR:

I think it has to be an increase

10

based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to

11

that statutory purpose is an increase above what you

12

would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit

13

and of course -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that's a way to give

15

every conceivable effect to that policy.

16

statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of

17

adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to

18

give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if

19

we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer

20

described.

21

notices will be meaningless.

22

But the

Everybody will be getting notices and the

MR. SHORR:

I don't think the notice is

23

problematic because you're alerting the consumer to

24

check that the information that the insurance company

25

expressly relied on to increase your charge 40

JUSTICE SOUTER:
that's circular.

6

8

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I walk into a candy

By that you're talking

10

linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose.

So

11

I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent

12

of the people have the best credit score and that's

13

about 1 percent.

14

have the best possible credit score.

15

means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly

16

right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps

17

a little more when they look at that report that, since

18

it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite

19

possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate

20

which might be reserved for just perfect people.

21

that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out

22

notices.

the people who apply for insurance or any other thing

get notices?

So 99 percent of the public doesn't

that the notices are more likely to go into the

2

wastebasket than they are if there was really a

3

decrease.

4

that?

5

Now, do you have any light you can shed on

MR. SHORR:

Sure.

The -- as an initial

6

matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the

7

standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's

8

best rate.

9

don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA

And that's a much broader standard.

We

10

6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six.

11

And of course not everyone is going to get the notice.

12

If your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have

13

great credit but your driving record eliminates the

14

possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you

15

wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either.

16

the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but

17

the information that the insurance company looks at is

18

incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect

19

information without ever having the opportunity to tell

20

the insurance company or whoever is collecting that

21

information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount

22

and I in fact qualify for that better rate.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

Don't you have that

24

right independently, though, every year to look at a

25

42
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SHORR:

Well, what's significant here,

2

that has been added to the statute in the last two

3

years.

4

notice at a critical time, when the insurance company

5

tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an

6

adverse action.

7

But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving

I wanted to also mention, here it's not just

8

an increase.

There's also been a denial, and that

9

Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied

10

insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so

11

that is also an adverse action under the act.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say you

13

look at the increase with respect to the best credit

14

rate, why is that?

15

to say the average insured who walks in the door?

16

Why wouldn't you look at it relative

MR. SHORR:

Because that -- GEICO's

17

argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes

18

they're looking at accurate credit information.

19

problem is, Congress has always told that there is

20

significant inadequacy in the credit information.

21

think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center

brief.

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't understand

2

what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do

3

you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline

4

from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?

5

MR. SHORR:

Because under GEICO's theory of

6

the statute you may never get notice, even though you're

7

being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate

8

information, as long as you're not charge -- your charge

9

doesn't move below average.

So a lot of people who are

10

in fact intended to be protected under this act will not

11

be protected until their charge goes below average, even

12

though the insurance company is continuing to charge

13

them more based on inaccurate information.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do we -- how do we know

15

that they were intended to be protected in this way by

16

getting this notice?

17

MR. SHORR:

That's the issue in the case.
Because going through the

18

statute and the increase based on credit, and then the

19

notice will give them the opportunity to check.

20

the consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and

21

balances, and unless you give this consumer the

22

opportunity to check that they are in fact using the

23

correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't

driven down by identity theft, you can continue to

charge people more 44

Your basic argument is the

a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer

MR. SHORR:

had presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court

interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not

putting someone in the best tier based on credit -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Who's GEICO?

I

15

mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a

16

particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law

Assume that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MS. MAHONEY:

If I could start by just

11

responding to the issue of the new document, I just want

12

to emphasize that this document was created by people

13

who weren't lawyers.

14

started using credit to price insurance.

15

said they were brainstorming about what the statute

16

might mean.

17

supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO

18

implemented the policy that we're talking about here,

19

the -- they said that the intent was that we would send

20

to the people who were supposed to get the adverse

21

action notice.

22

didn't have the ability to identify whether they were

23

supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because

24

they had not yet developed the way to do with what they

25

call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant

It was done before GEICO even
They were -

And I would point the Court to the

With the early systems development we

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't

2

taken credit into account at all.

3

procedure that's required actually in most States in

4

order to ensure that those who don't want to allow

5

access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient

6

credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning

7

of those State laws, and that means worse than the

8

average loss ratio.

9

even if you take into account the documents they're

And this is a

So there's nothing in this record,

10

talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a

11

knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.

12

With respect to a few of the factual or -

13

issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately

14

80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new

15

insurance to now have to get notice under the standards

16

established by the Ninth Circuit.

17

With respect to who can qualify for the top

18

tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO,

19

approximately 10 percent.

20

consumers would not qualify for that.

21

So 90 percent of the

And the statute very plainly does not

22

prohibit differential treatment based on persons with

23

better credit, nor do State laws.

24

to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because

25

there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you

And so the analogy as

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't treat any person of a different race in a

2

different way, and that's not true under this statute.

3

And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has

4

concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if

5

we're treating you worse than we would have treated you

6

if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if

7

you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll

8

send you the notice.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why did they use credit

10

reports?

11

the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk

12

factors generally?

13

Is it just a hedge against late premiums and

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, generally there are

14

about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up

15

with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a

16

good credit history is generally regarded as

17

responsible, and responsible people tend to make less

18

claims.

19

though.

20

And so, again, it's just one factor of 15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yeah.

May I ask this

21

question?

The reading of the statute in subsection i

22

about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to

23

favor your view.

24

employment really seems to read in favor of the

25

government's reading.

But subsection ii about denial of

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. MAHONEY:

Well actually, I think that

2

when you factor in employment, it has -- it has the

3

opposite effect.

4

using employment verification reports, consumer reports

5

about employment, there are all kinds of consumer

6

reports.

How do you tell who had the optimal employment

7

history?

How could the baseline be the best employment

8

history possible?

9

Because what happens here is if you're

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

But my point is, it

10

seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems

11

like the first applicant would be an adverse employment

12

action under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what

13

I'm trying to say?

14
15
16

MS. MAHONEY:

That if you -- that in other

words, if you gave someone a lower salary JUSTICE STEVENS:

It adversely affects any

17

current or prospective employee.

Now the language in i

18

isn't, it doesn't read that way.

But the thing that's

19

troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the

20

light of what ii seems to say.

21

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I think that if

22

GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less

23

because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO

24

would concede that that is in fact an adverse action.

25

So I don't think it's inconsistent at all.
