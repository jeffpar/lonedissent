ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10
11

MR. KESTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago

12

to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument

13

challenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of

14

1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract.

15

And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a

16

unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined

17

by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held

18

fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution.

19

This morning, you are here because an action was

20

brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical

21

manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a

22

license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is

23

invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying

24

royalties under protest in the meantime.

MR. KESTER:

a provision would be enforceable?
MR. KESTER:

I doubt it would be enforceable.

10

This is a jurisdictional ruling.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well, but as a matter of

later case, may have to address the question of whether or

MR. KESTER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce

20

this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits,

21

et cetera, et cetera.

MR. KESTER:

And those reasons, I would suggest,

23

Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most

24

part, in 1969.

MR. KESTER:

if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm not

8

wouldn't it?

9
10

MR. KESTER:

If the licensee said, "I am not

contesting that patent," that could be.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, but the patentee

12

would just say, "Look, we have a license.

13

I'm trying to see how

far you want -- are willing to push your argument that

5

just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a

6

settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the

7

controversy, the underlying legal dispute.

8

gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee,

9

can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the

Why aren't you -- you said,

16

"The only question before the court is jurisdictional."

17

If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal

18

Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is

19

listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the

20

outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was

MR. KESTER:

question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you

2

are in a situation like the business forms case in the

3

Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear.

the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out

MR. KESTER:

-- good would it do?

Suppose

13

we said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it.

14

It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c),

as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties,

you have -- and they just put a different label on it -

in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the

8

other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the

9

licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped.

Would

that be effective?
MR. KESTER:

That is a question that would arise

14

be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy

that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear,

and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of

17

this Court?

18

And the question before this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, you have rejected both of

the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder

20

might do to protect itself.

21

that you would concede the patent holder could do?

With respect to -- whether we

are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we

2

are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming

3

jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us

4

to accept your position, other than the reason that you

5

have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption

6

and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent

7

challenges freely?

we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally,

9

in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing

11

Is that the nub of our reasoning, if

with the affirmative defense in another case?
MR. KESTER:

Not quite, Justice Souter.

I would

say the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the

13

you, isn't it?

different policy issue?
MR. KESTER:

Well, I would say what it -- what

21

it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a

22

necessary fact.

23

specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an

24

injunction there, there would be -- there would be the

25

danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;

Because this Court, in Altvater,

and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of

JUSTICE SOUTER:

An

And -

But that is -- that is a good

6

reason.

7

good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part

8

of the licensee to challenge.

9
10

And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a

MR. KESTER:

Right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words, the nub of your

11

position, as I understand it, is the public policy that

12

favors relative -

13

MR. KESTER:

It -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. KESTER:

-- freedom to challenge --

It's more -- it's more than public

policy, it's Article III.

Article III says that you can

bring a lawsuit in this situation.

19

MR. KESTER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that was settled -

No -

-- in Aetna.
No, I realize that.

But, I

21

mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these

22

cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III.

23

And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you

24

want it drawn primarily because there are practical

reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now,

Now, is -- if -- I guess there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

I'd like to start with the fact that there are

4

four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief.

The

5

first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims.

6

The other three are styled as patent law claims.

7

important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in

8

Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the

9

cases, has said it's very important to look behind the

And it's

10

labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on

11

their claims.

12

of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an

13

accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing,

14

ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.

15

We need to actually see what is the cause

I want to start by explaining why there is no

16

contract claim at issue here.

You heard today, they're

17

trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract

18

dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract.

19

didn't argue that below, and with good reason.

20

just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit.

of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact

23

these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page

24

25

proper interpretation of the contract terms.

They

And I'd

Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

And let me

Official - Subject to Final Review

explain why.

2

The contract terms, which were just read to you,

3

is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says

4

that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis

5

on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has

6

not been held invalid by a court or other competent

7

jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken.

8

Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we

9

can come to court and have the court decide whether this

10

patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not,

11

then we can stop paying."

12

that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred

13

years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel.

14

15

we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid."

mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation"

21

that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that

22

the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would

like to have the Court say so now," end quote.

24

And the reason they didn't make

Your Honor.

4

"Well, there really is a dispute about the contract."

5

they never argued, below, and is foreclosed --

6

They can't just show up here today and say,

JUSTICE BREYER:

But

Shouldn't we send that back?

7

mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that

8

the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a

9

reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a

10

declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution

11

of the United States."

12

up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now

13

hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a

14

requirement.

15

just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory

16

Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a

17

contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to

18

get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the

19

contract.

I

Now, I have to admit, I've looked

Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've

But I might be wrong about that.

20

But you've now argued a different point.

21

MS. MAHONEY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well So, isn't the right thing for

23

us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send

24

it back?

25

they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not

If you're right that they have to pay, whether

2

win.

3

But should we decide those grounds today?
MS. MAHONEY:

Why?

Well, first of all, with respect

4

to this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a

5

real live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your

6

Honor.

7

didn't address it, because they didn't argue it, because

8

it's foreclosed by -

9

It's not part of this case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MS. MAHONEY:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Federal Circuit

But the question -

-- a precedent a hundred The question that is

12

presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral

13

argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to

14

us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "You

15

have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a

16

reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, that is the right -

18

that is the right starting point for a test, depending on

19

the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate.

20

here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that

21

they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an

22

infringement action under the patent laws.

23

In

And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to

24

adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement

25

action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that enforcement action.

2

language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for

3

failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution.

4

then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say,

5

Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because

6

the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their

7

legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that

8

would be cognizable coercion?

some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the

is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that

they could never get out of the deal.

12

could repudiate and then go ahead and sue.

13

14

they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the

15

costs and risks of litigation.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It is the reason --

But had they gotten to the

17

point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which

one party was saying, "You may not do this," and the other

party was saying, "Oh, yes I can," so that there -- there

20

was a focus controversy that would have been the subject

22

there not been this license agreement?

MS. MAHONEY:

they headed it off at the pass.

They understood that -

But the question is, How far

All right?

Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing

that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I don't think so, Your

18

Honor.

I think every single contract case in the lower

19

courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a

20

contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute

21

about the interpretation of the terms.

22

trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is

specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part

of it.

cases ever that allowed it.

to dismiss similar kinds of claims.

15

a surprise that a licensee could do this.

16

-- by the time that this license was executed in the

17

Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where

18

the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take

19

advantage of the protections of Lear until it has

20

repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it

21

wants to challenge validity.

4

different direction from where the Federal Circuit was

5

before.

6

MS. MAHONEY:

The District Court, at least as I

In all of the prior Federal

7

Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties.

8

And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is

9

the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish

10

jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge

11

validity, if it's still paying royalties.

12

Wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,

I don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because

14

I think they have to have their own right to bring the

action, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't.

16

Because they don't have an implied right of action under
