ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's

11

troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the

12

Armed Career Criminal Act.

13

of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this

14

Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida

15

attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as

16

they -- these types of convictions do not involve

17

explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious

18

potential risk of physical injury to another.

Under the text and structure

19

The Respondent in their brief has enunciated

20

a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify,

21

and that test that they enunciate is basically a

22

district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their

23

common sense and experience to determine whether an

24

offense should qualify.

25

kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and

That type of test is not the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at

2

determining whether convictions should qualify.

3

The categorical approach that this Court

4

enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of

5

prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements

6

of those crimes.

7

As such, the Government's argument would

8

open up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to

9

bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to

10

be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act.

11

instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree

12

felony in Florida.

13

Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated,

14

it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory

15

maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs.

16

if the Government's approach to the interpretation of

17

the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple

18

possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using

19

their common sense and everyday experience determines it

20

presents a serious potential risk of physical

21

injury to another.

22

For

It's a five-year statutory maximum.

Yet,

Obviously -

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we were looking at

23

attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that

24

involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk

25

of physical injury to another?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CRAWFORD:

Your Honor, in Taylor, this

2

Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or

3

generic burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that

4

serious potential risk when the person actually enters

5

the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an

6

attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most

7

other States, that act has not occurred.

8

entered, the defendant has not entered the property.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

You haven't

If the would-be burglar is

10

climbing through the window or on a ladder with the

11

intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that

12

involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

If the conduct -- again,

14

we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry.

15

Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far.

16

Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that

17

actually occurs.

18

attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to

19

get into the place and the person actually didn't get

20

in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the

21

person enters.

22

dwelling than inside the dwelling.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you were to say that the

The risk is much less outside the

But in Florida, that

24

would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the

25

curtilage around the house?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CRAWFORD:

The curtilage is a unique

2

concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the

3

enclosed space around the house that has some kind of

4

enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes.

5

the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to

6

the residence, that would actually be a burglary within

7

the State of Florida.

8
9

So if

In other States, it may not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And we don't

even have to ask whether that presents a serious

10

potential risk under the statute, right?

Because, if

11

burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without

12

the need to resort to the definition?

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, it would be a burglary

14

in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated

15

in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very

16

specific.

17

And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary

18

without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a

19

curtilage burglary.

20

It is the entering a dwelling or structure.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you could do it in a

21

noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the

22

ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of

23

the ladder.

24

a substantial step.

25

why would that not qualify under the words of the

statute that referred to a potential risk?

2

created the potential for the risk of harm that the

3

statute is getting at when you take the substantial

4

step?

5
6

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, trying to use the

Court's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that -

7
8

Haven't you

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, how about my question

first?

9

MR. CRAWFORD:

10

Okay.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, haven't you in the

11

words of the statute, created the potential for the risk

12

when you take that substantial step by starting up the

13

ladder?

14

MR. CRAWFORD:

If you started up the ladder

15

and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction

16

came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that

17

would be a potential risk.

18

potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.

19

Whether it's a serious

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you wouldn't analyze it

20

on the basis of whether this defendant started up the

21

ladder.

22

analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted

23

burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk;

24

isn't that the way it has to be done?

25

MR. CRAWFORD:

As I understand, you would -- you have to

That's the way that we submit
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those

2

facts.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but I thought your

4

argument was that that analysis would not lead to the

5

result unfavorable to your client because the nature of

6

starting up the ladder did not create or could not

7

reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.

8

In other words, I thought you were saying -

9

maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason

10

the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a

11

substantial step -- which is what the indictment would

12

charge -- could not be seen as creating the potential

13

risk that the statute talks about.

14
15
16

Now if I'm not understanding your argument
correctly, you know, straighten me out here.
MR. CRAWFORD:

I think I understand.

That

17

substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder,

18

Mr. James would submit based on the language of the

19

statute, would not qualify and would not create that

20

serious potential risk of physical injury.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's why simply

22

charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the

23

statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.

24

MR. CRAWFORD:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
But even if it would,
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's only one manner of attempt.

And it seems to me,

2

if you're going to do it generically, you have to look

3

over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does

4

the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say,

5

a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the

6

specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or

7

extortion?

Indeed, I guess you have to use the least

8

dangerous.

Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of

9

those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or

10

the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct.

11

Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes

12

already mentioned, and I would say that means that the

13

unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a

14

risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes

15

mentioned, which I would take to be extortion.

16

Wouldn't you say?

17

MR. CRAWFORD:

Of those four, extortion does

18

seem to potentially have the least risk of all those

19

crimes enumerated.

20
21

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:
risk, by the way?

MR. CRAWFORD:

MR. CRAWFORD:

2

potential and serious, some of those worlds potentially

3

knock each other out, and I apologize for using that

4

very word, but -

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:
just risk really?

7

MR. CRAWFORD:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

You think potential risk is

I think it is a risk.
But isn't one way of

looking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I

10

thought it's just redundant.

11

that the word potential is in there in order to

12

accommodate attempts.

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

But it may very well be

If that were true, I mean,

14

Congress when they wrote the statute, and in

15

924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically

16

enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that

17

violence.

18

of, or threatened use of physical force.

19

prong two, they specifically deleted that word

20

"attempt".

21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

But under

23

So it has an element, use of or attempted use

MR. CRAWFORD:

They did not include it, and

under CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
10
Alderson Reporting Company

That's quite

Official

1

different than specifically deleting it.

2

words, it was never there in the proposal.

3

MR. CRAWFORD:

In other

In 1984 actually, there was a

4

proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted

5

burglary would qualify.

6

never passed by the House, never enacted.

7

That was passed by the Senate,

So later on when burglary was actually

8

defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary

9

that Taylor came close to defining the same way.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, do I understand

11

your submission to be that putting a ladder against the

12

side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the

13

ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential

14

risk of physical injury?

15

MR. CRAWFORD:

If that were the only way to

16

prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that

17

would be -- that would be the requirement, the legal

18

requirement that you have to put the ladder against the

19

house and that's an element of the offense, that to me

20

would be a much closer call; but still, under the

21

analysis that we have provided the Court with the

22

Russello presumption, it should not qualify.

23

a closer case.

24
25

But it is

Whereas categorically when you look at
attempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

side of the house is an element of the offense.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We understand from

3

your friend on the other side that an overt act toward

4

fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.

5

In other words, it's not just enough to have burglary

6

tools in your house.

7

MR. CRAWFORD:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

You've got to take

an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.

10

Correct.

MR. CRAWFORD:

It is an overt act that is

beyond mere thinking about it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

structure.

9

I'm going to break into that, you know, business
That would be enough under Florida

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess we have to decide

10

how many attempts involve that kind of initial action,

11

which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how

12

many of them involve putting a ladder up against the

13

side of the house.

14

How do we possibly figure that out, to

15

decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from

16

attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of

17

risk from extortion?

18

MR. CRAWFORD:

That may be -- that may be a

19

very difficult question to answer, and maybe the

20

Respondent had that obligation in the district court,

21

because they have the obligation to prove that this

22

enhancement has that substantial or that serious

23

potential risk of physical injury to another and of

24

course they didn't do that.

1

Garner, this Court was talking about completed

2

burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a

3

4

percentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time.

5

But that's in a completed burglary.

That's

6

not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the

7

risk -

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:
question:

May I ask you this

It seems to me there are two ways to read the

10

burglary, arson or extortion examples:

11

clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to

12

individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put

13

in the statute to say, even though they don't involve

14

serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered,

15

because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that

16

burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime

17

that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the

18

statute nevertheless defines it.

19

That they are

So do you read those terms as giving

20

examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of

21

injury or as examples of crimes that would?

22

MR. CRAWFORD:

I think it can be read either

23

way, although I think even the Government's brief in

24

-- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about

25

extortion and burglary being crimes that can be
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

committed with no risk of physical injury to another

2

person and yet Congress still specifically

3

enumerated those -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Crawford, if you had

5

that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word

6

"otherwise".

7

arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or

8

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk.

9

The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in

You would have simply said is burglary,

10

some other manner, some other manner -- other from what?

11

Other from the preceding ones.

12

I don't think there is any sensible way to

13

read it except, you know, in some other manner than

14

these previously named crimes involves a physical risk;

15

and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the

16

least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and

17

any crime you want to get into this residual category

18

has to be at least as dangerous as that.

19

I think that's extortion.

20

MR. CRAWFORD:

As I've said,

Using that analysis, it's

21

hard to figure out, but again the Government had this

22

obligation or we submit the Government had this

23

obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary

24

to be any more dangerous.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Do you think that,

Official

1

is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a

2

serious potential risk as burglary does?

3

MR. CRAWFORD:

In Florida, or in the

4

Eleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracy

5

to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious

6

potential risk.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. CRAWFORD:

9

Sorry, go ahead.
So in the Eleventh Circuit

they have determined that.

But again, we submit under

10

that Russello presumption or even the statute itself,

11

Congress enumerated those four property crimes,

12

primarily property crimes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't that seem

like a fine line?

8

sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think

9

11

attempted burglary, but that is something that is

12

possible to know.

13

In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to

15

do it and that is the sentencing commission.

17

absence on a question like this of my being able to get

18

anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a

19

borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as

20

21

what the sentencing commission did in the absence of

22

better information from some other place?

23

All we have to do, as I said before,

They have the ability.

MR. CRAWFORD:

So they

And so in the

Well, the sentencing

24

commission when they were interpreting the career

25

offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

guideline that is worded different than the -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're trying to find out

3

the same answer to the same kind of question:

How many

4

of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how

5

many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being

6

hurt?

7

question in a borderline case without trying to find the

8

numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I

9

don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second

And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that

10

best alternative, which is at least they could get them,

11

and I hope they did get them before coming to the

12

conclusion they did.

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, they came to that

14

conclusion dealing with whether a career offender

15

provision should include attempted burglary not under

16

the armed career criminal statute and they specifically

17

recognized that.

18

Moreover, when they dealt with whether they

19

wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing

20

with career offender, which has, although it increases

21

the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it

22

certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero

23

to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.

24
25

So for those reasons, even if the sentencing
commission feels that the career offender statute or
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed

Moreover, the career offender statute says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Crawford, we've held

that the named crimes have to be considered generically

10

according to their elements, right?

Burglary, arson.

11

Have we ever held that the residual category or

12

"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious

13

potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be

14

decided generically?

15

residual category, not generically but according to the

16

crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant

17

has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against

18

the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to

me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't

to -- the Court decides it's a factual-based approach,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
21
Alderson Reporting Company

You don't have any

Official

1

doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other

2

named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential

3

risk?

4

of explosives?

5

don't you?

6

In other words, attempted arson or attempted use
You concede those would be covered,

MR. CRAWFORD:

Actually, no.

Those crimes,

7

attempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's

8

something about an attempted arson statute that has as

9

an element or something that presents a serious

10

potential risk of physical injury to another, which at

11

least in Florida that's not the case.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you think attempted

13

use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion?

14

I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is

15

concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is

16

much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.

17

MR. CRAWFORD:

Getting back to your

18

question, maybe this answers part of it:

Although the

19

Court -- you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question

20

about why can't we make this basically maybe a

21

fact-based inquiry.

22

categorical approach that we're dealing with in all the

23

other sections would almost become irrelevant because if

24

something doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to

25

a fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole

And if you were to do so, the whole

purpose of the categorical approach.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Crawford, does the

3

record show that the facts in the PSR came from police

4

reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the

5

court records?

6

MR. CRAWFORD:

The plea colloquy was not

7

ever presented or produced, and it does show that they

8

came from police reports.

9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where is that in the record?

MR. CRAWFORD:

I believe that is stated in

11

the PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under the

12

attempted burglary, which again were objected to.

13

Specifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to,

14

but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to,

15

and both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit

16

took that as being an objection to using anything

17

regarding the attempted burglary.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a

19

question about the relationship between generic burglary

20

and what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt?

21

And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was

22

alluded to in the Jones case.

23

Do you understand Florida law on attempted

24

burglary to be as follows:

that there must be an overt

25

act taken toward entering either a dwelling or a
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

structure, as distinct from an overt act taken to get

2

within the curtilage?

3

MR. CRAWFORD:

The evidence -- I see my time

4

is up.

Little me briefly answer this question.

5

want to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal.

6

Very quickly, the overt act has to refer to the

7

attempting to enter the dwelling.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Or -- I

And so -

So there's no such thing as

attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense
under burglary under Florida law.

11

MR. CRAWFORD:

Under Florida law attempting

12

to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is

13

the same thing.

14

the curtilage.

15

Dwelling is defined as the building or

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, so when you say

16

dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include

17

curtilage.

MR. MARCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
Petitioner's conviction for attempted

burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is a violent

5

felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because like

6

the crime of burglary Petitioner's crime categorically

7

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk

of physical injury to another.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Marcus, do you agree

10

with your brother's answer to my last question that

11

there would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under

12

Florida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an

13

overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from

14

entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?

15

MR. MARCUS:

Yes, while I would disagree

16

with that, but while there are -- with your

17

characterization.

18

reported cases involving an attempted burglary that

19

involved an attempt to get on to the curtilage, if -- I

think -- based on -

But there are no -- the number of

what Florida law is?

We don't know basically

it then if someone did have a fence around the house,

5

and I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn

toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the

an attempted burglary under Florida law?

MR. MARCUS:

10

Yes -- it could.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It could -

Would that be true if I

11

simply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get

12

on the other side of the fence but not into the

13

dwelling?

pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a

22

sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that

qualifies under the act?

MR. MARCUS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I mean Florida, in the State versus Hamilton case, we

1

discussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage

2

narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage

3

narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that

4

immediately surrounds the dwelling.

5

discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts

6

of appeals where the courts construed the concept of

7

curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana

8

that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling

9

house, in another case a whiskey still that was a

And the case

10

distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house,

11

that those were too far out to be considered part of the

12

curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds

13

the dwelling that's associated with the intimate

14

activities of the dwelling.

15

-- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme

16

Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly

17

construe that concept, and when it said it's not going

18

to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable

19

results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of

20

burglary is.

21

So Florida -- and Florida

So I think the -- so the first step, I

22

think, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way

23

Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress

24

had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it

25

presents a categorically different set of risks such that it
27

would even fall outside the otherwise clause.

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are a number of

3

Florida cases that involve open carports.

apply it there?

5

not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the

6

street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a

7

garden rake?

8
9

How would you

Somebody, if you had a carport that's

MR. MARCUS:

Well, I think under the

current, I think under the current statute, it has been

10

amended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is

11

relevant, the statute is relevant to this case.

12

now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself,

13

the structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under

14

the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not

15

enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other

16

structure it would not be considered part of the

17

curtilage.

18

it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that

19

had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and

20

noted that the court in that case hadn't determined

21

whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.

22

I think

And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case,

So it does -- the statute does -- the

23

concept does require an enclosure and the area

24

immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is

25

very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that way, in that limited way, that someone who's

2

intending to get on to a residence into the area either

3

in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not

4

sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that

5

Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of

6

the paradigmatic offenses in the statute.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in an ordinary city street

8

in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of

9

houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in

10

front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or

11

there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes

12

up to the house and starts to monkey around with the

13

window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted

14

burglary, not burglary, in Florida?

15

MR. MARCUS:

16

understanding.

17

That -- yes.

That is my

If it was not enclosed.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So then I doubt

18

-- then again I'm left at sea.

I don't know how often

19

that happens or is dangerous.

So if I think that this

20

is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it

21

is -- and the Government is in the best position, they

22

have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over

23

there.

24

In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a

25

statistical question, and the Government doesn't have

So what about a presumption against the Government?

14
15

I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit

Well, there are several things

First you can look at the text of the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I read the text several

times.

16

MR. MARCUS:

Congress provided some guidance

17

by setting out four examples of crimes that do present

18

the type of risk they had in mind.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.

And here I think

20

it might be less than burglary.

And extortion, though

21

one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or

22

something and revealing a secret from the past -- many

23

such crimes are threats of violence.

24

just read through the statutes, and that's what they are

25

aiming at.

I mean, and that

So I would say extortion is something that
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

quite often could involve violence.

2
3

But again that's cogitating.
to attempted burglary.

4

MR. MARCUS:

I don't know.

So I get

Now what do I do?

Well, I think -- I think you

5

have to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enacting

6

the statute, Congress directed your attention to the

7

serious potential risk that an offense presents.

8

think that just -- and criminal law requires courts and

9

juries all the time to take into account and to use

I

10

their common sense and experience to judge the risks

11

that are presented by a particular crime.

12

very concept of recklessness itself refers to a

13

substantial disregard of -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the

Mr. Marcus, it is a lot

15

easier to do that with respect to the facts and

16

circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it

17

generically -- you know -- picking out attempted

18

burglary.

19

read this, this residual category to refer to the facts

20

and circumstances of the particular crime of which the

21

defendant has been convicted?

22

to do that.

23

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year

24

that involves conduct that presents a serious potential

25

risk of injury, physical injury to another.

It is very hard to do that.

Why shouldn't we

The language enables you

The term violent felony means any crime

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean

2

generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which

3

this defendant stands convicted?

4

MR. MARCUS:

Well, all that -- this law has

5

been interpreted for many years.

No courts of appeals

6

have, have construed that it way.

They have construed

7

it to require a categorical approach.

8

look at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly

9

with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort

And then if you

10

of a categorical approach that, while these courts had,

11

sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post

12

basis, it might not present any risk, the idea that

13

these crimes categorically present a potential -- a

14

serious potential risk of physical injury.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And would you agree,

16

Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard

17

excludes that interpretation?

18

particular crime?

19

MR. MARCUS:

If you look at the

Well, I think the Court

20

referred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- to

21

Congress's approach.

22

of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to

23

crimes that are inherently presented -

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

And under the statute, that sort

Didn't we -- didn't we also

go further and say one reason to construe it that way is
32
Alderson Reporting Company

we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having

2

sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to

establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials.

5

there was.

what -

7

Yeah, I wrote Shepard.

MR. MARCUS:

There

I think

And I think that's

There was that as well.

And I

8

don't think it is beyond the ability of courts to

9

take a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure

10

out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements

11

and then use common sense and experience to make a

12

judgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by

13

that conduct.

14

Looking at the situation -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Marcus, isn't there

15

this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway?

16

Because this language if it said -- that sometimes

17

presents a serious risk, then the answer would be

18

obvious.

19

presents a serious risk, then it might be closer.

20

which do you think is the more normal reading of it?

21
22

If otherwise it said that characteristically

I think either is -- certainly fits the
language.

23

MR. MARCUS:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

And

And either Either means sometimes

presents a potential risk of physical injury, then
33
Alderson Reporting Company

2

characteristically presents the risk, potential risk,

3

then do you have to decide whether that, it is a

4

characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it

does present this risk or that just once in a while it

6

does.

7

MR. MARCUS:

No.

Or if it says

think it has to, characteristically taken at a general

9

level, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of

12

as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's

13

only three percent of them actually involve risk to -

14

15

must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent.

16

would think that.

18
19

21
22

Would that satisfy the characteristic

MR. MARCUS:

I think it would.

First of

all, Congress -

I

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why is it two or three

percent?
MR. MARCUS:

The statistics he is referring

23

to came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986

and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as

25

one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

presented a serious potential risk of injury.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I don't think that's

3

perfectly clear.

The "otherwise" language does suggest

4

that you are right.

5

saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct

6

that presents a serious risk," which I think is a

7

permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but

8

if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as

9

a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent

But if the statute instead of

10

requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether

11

or not they do.

12

MR. MARCUS:

Well, this Court interpreted

13

the statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on

14

page -- on page 597 of Taylor.

15

that Congress's choice of language indicates that

16

Congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as

17

burglaries involving some aspect making them especially

18

dangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential

19

risk to count toward enhancement.

20

in the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be

21

the correct reading of the statute.

22

Congress identify -- they created two categories of

23

violent felonies.

24

element of the offense that goes to targeting a person

25

for physical harm.

I mean this Court said

Because why did

that don't necessarily target a person for physical harm

physical injury to a person.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be fine if

5

burglary were the only thing that Congress said there,

6

but it also said extortion.

7

fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically -

8

characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm.

9

I just don't think it does.

10

MR. MARCUS:

And I think it absolutely

Well, Congress identified it as

11

a violent felony presumably because it believed it had

12

-- it had the criteria.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but is the criterion

14

"characteristically," or is the criterion whatever

15

minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?

16

MR. MARCUS:

Well, that it carries the

17

potential risk, because when any -- when someone

18

commits extortion there might be a tendency to -- if

19

there -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is the level of potential

risk the level that exists in extortion?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe, the same point,

2

isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in

these attempt cases is characteristically going to be

4

pretty close to zero?

5

They're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples

6

we've been talking about.

7

I mean, they're not in the house.

MR. MARCUS:

I don't agree, Your Honor.

9

risk.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

One way to do that is to

11

say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of

12

the harm that comes from the commission of the crime

13

itself.

14

I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo

15

it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the

act itself of putting the ladder up against the building

measurable.

victims get shot when they appear in the course of

that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it.

I'm

I mean -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't believe it for

a minute.

9

(Laughter.)

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why do you look at

11

the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of

12

lesser included offense?

13

have their own independent risk of physical injury.

14

Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of

15

my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's

16

a risk of injury there, even though there's no -

17

regardless of whether the person gets into the house or

18

not.

19

I mean, attempts themselves

And I think perhaps there's even a greater

20

risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury

21

with respect to attempts because they don't succeed.

22

Why don't they succeed?

23

them.

And what interrupts them, it may well be the home

24

owner.

So I don't know that you have to look to sort of

25

attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.

Because something interrupts

MR. MARCUS:

Well, Congress doesn't look to

2

attempt as a lesser offense.

We pointed out in our

3

brief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S.

4

Criminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the

5

completed offense.

6

of the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results

7

of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is

8

focused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has,

9

has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior

And if you think about the purpose

10

violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage

11

in behavior that is dangerous, that presents

12

dangers to public safety.

13

attempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone

14

who has committed attempt by definition has intended to

15

commit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event.

17

Why would Congress in this statute want to differentiate

18

between the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't

19

succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the

20

successful burglar?

21

language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as

22

you said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the

23

equivalent -

24
25

So if you think about the

I think the serious potential risk

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would suppose the

unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

injury than the successful burglar.

2

MR. MARCUS:

Arguably.

I mean, if you look

3

at the case law, the vast majority of cases, the

4

furthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find,

5

the most extreme case that he's found involves someone

6

who's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or

7

casing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme

8

example.

9

case law, you do find the physical proximity to the

10
11

So even with attempts, you find in all the

premises.
And one of the main reasons it wouldn't

12

succeed is because somebody, there's the presence of

13

someone who frustrates the entry.

14

level, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any

15

lower risk presented by the attempt.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that even on that

Well, what do you say about

17

your brother's argument that the statistics show there's

18

a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of

19

violence in the course of committing the burglary?

20

take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want

21

to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the

22

potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at

23

the near attempt stage.

24

MR. MARCUS:

25

I

But again, I think -- I don't

think you need to have those statistics.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I don't think you do

2

either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got

3

to rest really on the potential for harm in the

4

commission of the offense.

5

MR. MARCUS:

That's the very reason that

6

attempts are prohibited, because they present the

7

serious potential to produce the harms that the

8

completed offense presents.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do I correctly understand,

10

we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not

11

available, but in your view if we did have statistics

12

and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the

13

category of crimes across the nation, there was this

14

risk, that would be enough?

15

MR. MARCUS:

For attempts?

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

Well, for attempts

17

or complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what

18

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if

19

1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the

20

category, did present such a risk, that would be

21

sufficient under your view.

22
23

MR. MARCUS:

Yes, I think Congress wanted to

treat a frustrated burglar the same -

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. MARCUS:

Yes.

The answer is yes?
They've shown the same

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

propensity to engage in the conduct that Congress was

2

concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So then it's a really easy

4

case, because really there is some risk in every case.

5

There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump

6

into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.

7

MR. MARCUS:

But that's not what we're

8

asking the Court here.

We're asking the Court to look

9

at the elements of the offense, and to look at the

10

elements of the offense to see whether that creates a

11

situation in which violence is likely to arise.

12

you're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a

13

dwelling where you have -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Here

Yes, but none of the

15

elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical

16

injury in the burglary case.

17

burglars.

18

MR. MARCUS:

You can have unarmed

But in considering the conduct

19

involved in the offense, the attempting to get, the

20

attempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home,

21

someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in

22

which violence could occur -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

Right.

And as I

understand your view MR. MARCUS:

That doesn't 42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If in 1/10 of 1 percent of

2

the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation,

3

that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.

4

MR. MARCUS:

Yes.

But again, first of all,

5

I don't think the statistics would show that.

I don't

6

think logically they would show that in light of the

7

numbers that are shown for completed burglary.

8

again, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that

9

are covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't

But

10

see why you would distinguish between the person who

11

tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen

12

event.

13

triggered the same set of risks that the successful

14

burglar has.

They have created the same set of risks, they've

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

So in other words, you're

16

saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider

17

not just what this particular defendant succeeded in

18

accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to

19

accomplish?

20

MR. MARCUS:

That's correct.

I think the

21

statute permits you to do that with its plain language

22

of focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, the

23

serious potential risk.

24

at the rationale for attempts and why we punish

25

attempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished

And that -- and also in looking

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your

2

dangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed

3

the offense.

4

of State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt

5

behavior.

6

attempted burglary as well as burglary.

7

--

8
9
10

Again, the State codes, the vast majority

They predicate felony murder convictions on

JUSTICE BREYER:
assault?

And as I said

What about attempted

I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an

attempted assault.

11

MR. MARCUS:

Well, I think, my understanding

12

would be that would be covered under the first subsection

13

for the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of

14

force.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But it wouldn't

16

fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens

17

when you try to get away from numbers.

18

a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or

19

embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during

20

an embezzlement and start hitting each other.

Maybe there are

21

I can't get away from the numbers.

22

MR. MARCUS:

But there in those type

23

offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense,

24

there's no nexus between those elements and the -- a

25

reaction that someone might have just to being
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

prosecuted.

I mean, that's not JUSTICE BREYER:

So what's the test?

The

3

test is either a high statistical number of injuries or

4

if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high

5

statistical number of injuries?

6

because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea

7

what it means.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. MARCUS:

I like the word nexus

Well, in this statute you're

10

talking about career criminals, people who have

11

committed a number of crimes and have recently just been

12

convicted of being an armed felon.

13

that's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting

14

point, and take -- so this case doesn't present

15

questions about other cases that might present -

16

arguably present, or present a serious risk of physical

17

injury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the

18

crimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress

19

had in mind.

20

falls at the core of the statute; we're talking about

21

someone who intends to commit the core crime Congress

22

was talking about.

23

And I think

I think that's another case.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This case

Mr. Marcus, assuming we

24

accept your view about the way the statute should be

25

read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that

2

burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?

3
4
5

MR. MARCUS:
generic burglary.

We haven't argued that it is

That's correct.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I guess my -- so that leads

6

me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my

7

understanding is it's not a generic burglary.

8
9

Therefore, even on your reading of the
statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't

10

necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in

11

under the residuary clause, of course.

12

there is a possibility that the only burglary charged

13

was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't

14

we have to send the thing back to find out either from

15

court records whether something more than a mere

16

penetration of curtilage was involved here?

17

whether -- whether that penetration carried with it the

18

potential for harm?

19

MR. MARCUS:

I mean, no.

And because

And if so,

That's why you

20

have the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just as

21

this Court said in Taylor, that they weren't -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the only thing we

23

know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an

24

attempt at burglary.

25

burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the

If the burglary were a generic

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

end of the case.

2

MR. MARCUS:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But this is not a generic

4

burglary.

5

in this case could have been nothing more than stepping

6

across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over

7

to take the apple.

8

to court records?

9

advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor

10
11

Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt

And therefore, don't we have to go
In other words, don't we have to take

before this case can finally be decided?
MR. MARCUS:

No.

I mean, you've identified

12

an additional step that the Court has to consider in

13

deciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't

14

necessarily require you to go to court records.

15

it's our position that even including the curtilage, the

16

area, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling

17

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean,

Well, could you tell us

19

what your position is if we choose to use the

20

noncategorical or the modified categorical approach?

21

Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence

22

report and some other charging documents, or is it just

23

in the presentencing report?

24
25

MR. MARCUS:

Yes.

The charging documents

are not part of the record in this case.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

The record

Official

1

right now is solely comprised of the presentence report.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And we don't have any

3

transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like

4

that?

5

MR. MARCUS:

No.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, what about -- do you

7

think the facts in the presentence report are admitted

8

by your opponent or not?

9
10

MR. MARCUS:

in the presentence report.

11
12

He didn't object to the facts
He also did not object -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Therefore, can we consider

them?

13

MR. MARCUS:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So therefore, then the

15

question is whether throwing the hammer through the

16

window is sufficient; is that right?

17

MR. MARCUS:

Well, that would resolve

18

Justice Souter's question about whether it would involve

19

the curtilage at all, which would show that there was an

20

attempted physical entry into the residence.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you think that the

22

hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do

23

look at the individual case?

24
25

MR. MARCUS:

Well, we don't -- yes,

certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dwelling presents a serious potential risk

2

categorically.

3

and you thought that only a subset of attempted

4

burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential

5

risk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly

6

satisfy any conception of that.

7

But if you didn't agree with that, then,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because the hammer is

8

thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be

9

sure I understand your view of the importance of the

10

hammer.

11

MR. MARCUS:

12

physical entry into the residence.

13

on the threshold of the dwelling.

14
15

Because there was an attempted

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The person was right

I'm still a little unclear

as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.

16

MR. MARCUS:

Again, we don't think you have

17

to attribute any particular significance to that.

18

mean, it's our position that categorically this crime is

19

covered.

20

that with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical

21

proximity to the dwelling, but even if there was -

22

I

And again, the case law shows that there's -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though there's some

23

cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't

24

involve any risk to anybody.

25

careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see

Say the enterprising but

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses

2

to make his entry.

3

MR. MARCUS:

That's correct.

You can always

4

posit, under the categorical risk, you could always

5

posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that

6

equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted

7

burglary.

8

where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might

9

seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think

And so while you could posit a hypothetical

10

categorically about people who are trying to surmount,

11

get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the

12

dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're

13

presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the

14

Court can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise

15

clause, the burglary under Florida law is not so

16

different from the kind of burglary that Congress had in

17

mind that it would just drop out of the picture

18

entirely.

19

into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in

20

the house or right around the house, present the very

21

kind of risk that Congress was concerned about.

22

Armed felons who have the propensity to go

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you agree that this

23

presentence report cannot be consulted under the

24

reasoning of Shepard, we need more?

25

Well, under Shepard, the

Official

1

defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police

2

reports.

3

affidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of

4

anything in the police report.

5

distinguishable in that there was no objection to the

6

facts in the PSR and there was no objection

7

specifically to using the police report as the source

8

for those facts.

9

My understanding is he also submitted an

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think this case is

You don't think the PSR

10

has some kind of significance that the police report did

11

not?

12

MR. MARCUS:
it would.

It wouldn't, no.

I don't think

But -- no.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is the following sort of

15

summary fair:

16

State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy

17

the burglary prong in subsection 2?

18

argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary

19

State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the

20

"otherwise" prong; is that correct?

21

MR. MARCUS:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23
24
25

Because Florida is not a generic burglary

But on your

Argument Is that a fair statement of

your argument?

potential for violence in either one of those.

that would leave open any potential felony to qualify

couldn't have intended that.
Moreover, there's still an issue that was

brought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance.

these necessarily determinations that were found by the

Florida court or by the Florida system for a Florida

attempted burglary conviction?

And you're going beyond the mere fact of the
prior conviction.

You're looking at many other

components, the risk of the conviction, which is not the

same thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction.
