ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. McLEAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that

11
12

chapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the

13

time of AEDPA's enactment.

14

cases, this is determined by the filing date of the

15

application for habeas relief.

In the general run of habeas

This case will resolve a split between the five

16
17

circuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the

18

Ninth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the

19

pre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital

20

case.

21

We believe that the five circuits are correct.

22

Neither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphy

23

identifies the commencement event that triggers the

24

application of chapter 153.

25

determine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is

In light of this, we must

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course,

2

AEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide

3

greater deferential review to State -- State criminal

4

convictions.
Chapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a

5
6

merits petition.

It repeatedly contains express language,

7

such as that contained in 2244(d), which is found at

8

petitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute of

9

limitations provisions and provides that the statute of

10

limitations applies to the application for habeas relief.

11

Similarly, the standard of review in 2254(d) at

12

petitioner's appendix 191 --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well, what do we do about McFarland's

approach?
MS. McLEAN:

Your Honor, I believe that -- that

16

these are easily reconciled.

17

there's a -- I think the habeas proceedings can be -- are

18

unique and can be extended.

19

into -- into segments.

20

I believe that it -- that

They can also be divided

The first phase is the pre-application phase,

21

which is what McFarland was concerned about.

In that

22

case, this Court was concerned about providing, pursuant

23

to 21 U.S.C. 848 -- concerned about the pre-application

24

grant of counsel to habeas petitioners.

25

entirely separable from the merits proceeding that occurs

But that is

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

after the filing of the -- of the petition itself which

2

brings the merits before the court.
QUESTION:

3

It's the difference between a case

4

and a proceeding.

How -- how do you get us here under the

5

words of the statute?

6

MS. McLEAN:

The -- actually, the provisions of

7

chapter 153 themselves do not contain the word case.

8

That -- we only come to that term at all because in this

9

Court's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to -- created

10

a -- viewed the -- as being a negative inference from the

11

absence of the pending cases language that appears in the

12

154 provisions.
The 153 provisions do not have that -- those --

13
14

that term in them.

Instead, they use the specific express

15

words of an application.

16

application.

17

the portion of the case that we're talking about is the

18

merits portion of the -- of the case.

They clearly apply to an

And the case -- that's reconcilable because

This Court recognized that there can be multiple

19
20

cases in a habeas proceeding.

21

the Court recognized that there could be a separate

22

appellate case that -QUESTION:

23

In Slack versus McDaniel,

How was it treated on the court's

24

docket?

I mean, the -- something was going on.

25

a request for a stay.

There was

There was a request for the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

appointment of counsel.

So something was initiated, and

2

what was that something called?

3

MS. McLEAN:

That would -- it could be

4

characterized as -- you could use the word case.

5

could use the word habeas corpus proceeding.
QUESTION:

6
7

You

Do you know how it was in fact?

How

was it treated on the court's docket?

8

MS. McLEAN:

9

QUESTION:

Was it given a case name and a file?

MS. McLEAN:

10

It --

It was -- it was certainly given a

11

case name and assigned a case number, undoubtedly, but I

12

do not -QUESTION:

13
14

And would that number indicate that

it was a habeas petition?
MS. McLEAN:

15

I'm sure it did because our courts

16

in California, the -- the district courts have numbers

17

that specify that it's a habeas proceeding.
QUESTION:

18
19

So it was on the docket as a habeas

case.

20

MS. McLEAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. McLEAN:

That's correct.
And that's not good enough.
That's not determinative.

23

I'm -- my position is, or our position is, is that

24

these -- that the habeas proceeding is unique and

25

extended.

What

It includes three phases; includes the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pre-application phase, which is the -- what McFarland was

2

concerned about.

3

phase that begins with the filing of the application for

4

habeas relief.

It -- it then has the merits application

It then also has the appellate phase.

QUESTION:

5

Well, McFarland was a totally

6

different statute from AEDPA, was it not?

7

it's a totally separate statute.

8

MS. McLEAN:

9

QUESTION:

It -- it was --

That's correct, Your Honor.
And really, what we're trying to

10

interpret here, I take it, is the meaning of some of the

11

language in Lindh.

12

specific language in -- even in AEDPA.

We're -- we're not talking about any

MS. McLEAN:

13

Well, we're concerned about --

14

Lindh used the phrase that -- that there was

15

non-retroactivity of chapter 153 to cases -- to cases

16

pending under 153.
So the question is, what is the commencement

17
18

event that we talked about, that -- that we're referring

19

to?

20

chapter 153?

21

What -- what creates the pending case for purposes of

For that, we have to look back to the express

22

terms of the statute.

23

the -- the pre-application phase --

24
25

QUESTION:

Since 153 can -- doesn't apply to

Why -- why would we look to the

express terms of the statute when Lindh itself didn't rely

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

on any express terms of this statute?

Why wouldn't we

2

look to -- to what makes sense with respect to the rule

3

that we have created?

4

MS. McLEAN:

I would agree with that, that

5

the -- what I'm saying is that in the absence of -- in the

6

absence of language -- there's clearly an absence of

7

language in 153 that addresses this commencement event.

8

So that puts us into a position of looking to see what

9

Congress intended based on what the express words of

10

chapter 153 are.

Is -- is there anything in chapter 153

11

that tells us that, no, we didn't mean the -- the -- a

12

commencement of a habeas proceeding based on the filing of

13

an application?

14

motion for -- for a request for appointment of counsel.

We meant something earlier, i.e., the

And the answer to that is no.

15

Simply no.

There

16

is nothing in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the

17

pre-application proceeding.

18

demonstrated by their terms and also the habeas corpus

19

rules concerning chapter 2254 cases -- those only can

20

apply -- expressly apply to applications for habeas

21

relief.

22

doesn't -- it thwarts the purposes of AEDPA by -- by

23

unduly confining the number of cases covered by it,

24

capital cases covered by it.

25

QUESTION:

Those provisions, as is

They do not apply to any earlier event, and it

It --

That's the part I wonder.

I was

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thinking that if it's open to -- pend -- the -- the

2

case -- what is it called?

3

that it's at least open to calling this pending.

4

possible construction.

5

MS. McLEAN:

6

QUESTION:

Is it -- McFarland -- suggests
It's a

Yes, it's a possible construction.
And then -- and then it being a

7

possible construction, I wonder, well, there was an awful

8

lot of proceeding that went on here.

9

It was opposed.

There was a stay.

And all of this took place before the --

10

the petition was filed.

11

least as we've interpreted it, is to stay away from

12

proceedings that were already underway, this would seem to

13

have been well underway.
MS. McLEAN:

14

So if the purpose of AEDPA, at

It was -- the -- the proceeding was

15

well underway, but that doesn't -- is not determinative

16

in -- in the sense that counsel had been appointed and a

17

petition was in the works.
QUESTION:

18

But that --

That's -- that's what I want you to

19

address precisely.

That's where I'm uncertain.

20

as if the language -- you could -- you could -- you

21

could -- the language is open to either interpretation --

22

MS. McLEAN:

23

QUESTION:

It seems

I don't -And yet -- well, you -- you think

24

it's more strong in your direction.

25

that.

I -- I understand

But if -- say, if it's open to either

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretation, then why doesn't the purpose of the

2

application provisions, as we've interpreted them, suggest

3

don't apply it where proceedings are well underway, which

4

would mean the other side would win here.

5

asking you.

6

That's why I'm

I want to see what your response is.

MS. McLEAN:

In order to deviate from -- from

7

the normal -- also, there is no question that in -- in the

8

general run of habeas cases, it's triggered by the filing

9

of the application.

So the question is whether there's

10

some justification, some harm that would be caused by

11

not -- by treating them -- them being the capital cases --

12

under the Ninth Circuit's ruling differently than we do

13

the normal run of habeas cases.

14

the fact that a counsel had been appointed or that -- that

15

a application was in the works, but not yet filed, that

16

would prevent us or harm in any way those petitioners from

17

ultimately being subject to the greater standards of

18

deferential review that -- that AEDPA ultimately imposed.

19

There's no harm whatsoever.

20

And there's nothing about

And it doesn't further -- it thwarts the

21

purposes of AEDPA to do that.

23

differently --

MS. McLEAN:

He did not need to, but he -- he

was fully compliant.
To the extent that the Court's concern here

24

appears to this counsel to be concerned about the statute

25

of limitations, there was no issue here.

This case came

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

in timely.

And in fact, in the Ninth Circuit, they

followed the same rule that all the other five circuits

followed all the way up until 1998.

of limitations is virtually a non-issue in this situation.

So really the statute

There is no harm in this

The only issue is that now, once this case was

9
10

in the district court and in the Ninth Circuit, should it

11

be subject to the deferential standards of review that

12

AEDPA imposed, and the answer to that is yes.

13

no -- there is absolutely no harm in now saying that

14

because the filing of the application came in after the

15

enactment of AEDPA, that it should be subject, just as all

16

other habeas cases are, to --

MS. McLEAN:

QUESTION:

23

MS. McLEAN:

That's correct.
How many cases are in that category?
We believe -- we believe that it

24

affects approximately -- in the Ninth Circuit,

25

particularly in California, it affects approximately

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

45 capital cases.

2

QUESTION:

45 cases.

3

MS. McLEAN:

It also -- it also, of course,

4

affects the other -- those cases, those capital cases,

5

that are covered by the other circuits which currently

6

use -- all of which, other than the Ninth Circuit, as to

7

those 45 cases, use the filing date of the application.

8

So if the Court, obviously, was to choose the position

9

advocated by respondent, it would change the standard of

10

review from AEDPA to non-AEDPA in those States covered by

11

those circuits.
In the Ninth Circuit, what will -- would happen

12
13

if you adopted the position that I'm advocating is that

14

you -- that those 45 cases in California, approximately

15

45 cases in California, will now become AEDPA cases.

16

that will primarily affect the standard of review that is

17

applied to them.

1

MS. McLEAN:

That's certainly true, but it's

2

very important.

Garceau is the perfect example of why

3

this is an important issue for this Court, the -- in

4

Garceau, the -- the State -- the State supreme court

5

issued a very well-reasoned opinion issuing -- saying that

6

it had decided that error was harmless, upholding the

7

conviction that occurred in this case.

It went through

The district court agreed.

It went

10

In -- in 2001, it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which

11

did -- because it did not believe it was an AEDPA case,

12

refused to apply the deferential standard of review,

13

refused to apply the precedents of this Court, instead

14

looked at its own -- its own cases, and reversed it.

15

And this is -- you know, this is the most

16

important -- a capital conviction in California is the

17

most important cases -- some of the most important cases

18

that that State issues.

19

for the failure to apply this -- the standards that

20

Congress imposed in 1996 is a very, very serious matter.

21

And that's just one case.

22

And -- and so, we believe that it's very important to have

23

this issue straightened out.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNNE S. COFFIN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MS. COFFIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The issue is not whether this harms Mr. Garceau,

10

but whether it is appropriate under this Court's precedent

11

to rule the way the State asked this Court to rule.

12
13
14

For two independent reasons, the amendments to
chapter 153 do not apply to Mr. Garceau.
First, it simply cannot be, as the State

15

suggests, that after this Court found in McFarland that

16

a capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion for

17

counsel, that Congress then passed a new statute,

18

intending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent

19

in this case.

20

informed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland.

21

The McFarland Court ruled that -- that Congress had

22

permitted a capital proceeding to be initiated by the

23

filing of a motion for counsel.

24

2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas

25

corpus law in AEDPA.

Congress must be presumed to have been

That ruling was only

Under statutory construction

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

principles, Congress must be found to have been aware of

2

and followed this Court's precedent set in McFarland.
QUESTION:

3

Well, are you -- are you saying,

4

Ms. Coffin, that McFarland is controlling in the very

5

strict sense of the word here, that if -- we must rule in

6

your favor without looking anywhere else just because of

7

the decision in McFarland?
MS. COFFIN:

8
9

No.

What I'm -- what I am saying

is that I believe that this Court should look to what

10

informed Congress when they wrote AEDPA.

And I think once

11

that is done, this Court will conclude that if you

12

interpret the ruling in Lindh, where -- where 107(c)

13

applies to 153 and 154 -- where did Congress get the word

14

case when they were determining who would be subject to

15

this law?

16

case is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket.

17

That is your case, and that is consistent with what this

18

Court decided in McFarland.

And I agree with Justice Ginsburg that when a

What is not consistent is to believe that

19
20

Congress used the word case rather than petition when they

21

quite clearly used petition in many other parts of the

22

statute.

23

QUESTION:

When -- when did Congress pass the

24

law that -- that overturned the result in McFarland?

25

say they passed a law that overturned the result?

MS. COFFIN:

No, no.

What I said was that they

2

passed AEDPA, and when they did that, they were informed

3

in how they wrote that statute by McFarland.

'96.

QUESTION:

with the issue of McFarland.

7

Okay.

MS. COFFIN:

That was in

And they -- they haven't dealt

Well, in -- yes and no.

I mean,

8

I think that they -- they had an opportunity to change

9

848(q) and looked at 848(q) --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. COFFIN:

12

chose to leave 848(q) in place.

13

Yes.

QUESTION:

-- when they wrote AEDPA, and they

Well, now, is that supported by

14

something in, say, the legislative history, or is that

15

just your -- your own view of what must have happened?

16

MS. COFFIN:

There is nothing in the legislative

17

history that supports one side or the other.

However, if

18

one looks at McFarland -- the majority decision, as well

19

as Justice O'Connor's concurrence and dissent -- one sees

20

that this Court made it very clear to Congress that if

21

they meant something like petition or application, which

22

are pretty much used synonymously, that they better put

23

those words in because, in fact, the majority in this --

24

in -- of this Court refused to read that kind of language

25

into McFarland, and that's part of how McFarland got

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decided.
So very shortly thereafter, Congress wrote a law

2
3

completely revising or, you know, substantially revising

4

habeas corpus.

5

at that point, they decided not to look at the majority

6

opinion in McFarland which uses the word case.

And it's simply difficult to believe that

QUESTION:

7

But it's -- it's not at all an

8

unusual phenomenon that -- that a word in -- in statutes

9

has different application in different contexts where

10

you -We had a case the other day.

11

When is something

12

final?

Congress says, you know, when -- when it's final.

13

It depends on what the context is, and nothing -- nothing

14

says that just because you -- you think that the case for

15

one purpose, for the McFarland purpose, begins with the --

16

with the initial filings, for -- for all purposes it has

17

to begin there.

18

And what impresses me about this case is that I

19

don't see what is gained by extending the inapplicability

20

of AEDPA earlier than the filing of the habeas petition

21

because the purpose of -- of the non-retroactivity

22

provision is certainly not to cause somebody to be

23

frustrated in actions that he took in reliance upon the

24

prior law.

25

frustrated in events that occur after the filing of his

And -- and a -- a habeas applicant could be

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

habeas petition.

But all of the events prior to that

2

filing that were covered by McFarland, they aren't covered

3

by AEDPA anyway.

AEDPA could not possibly affect those

4

earlier events.

So -- so nothing -- nothing is served by

5

making the retroactivity go back further.
MS. COFFIN:

6

Well, I -- I think there are

7

actually two answers to that question.

The first one is

8

it isn't really an issue of whether or not -- in my

9

opinion, it's not an issue of whether or not some harm is

10

going to come to -- to Mr. Garceau by interpreting this

11

one way or the other.

That's not the issue.

The issue is what did Congress mean when they

12
13

did this.

They had one purpose, I agree with you, which

14

was to reform habeas corpus and make things move in a --

15

in a more orderly fashion.

16

QUESTION:

Right.

17

But they had another -- there -- there is also

18

another part to that, and that is, they determined that

19

certain cases would not be covered by AEDPA.

20

QUESTION:

And so --

Well, those cases -- those cases, in

21

which they did not want to frustrate legitimate

22

expectations.

23

But my point is, there is no possible legitimate

24

expectation that would be frustrated by AEDPA in the

25

pre-application stage.

AEDPA simply doesn't have anything

to do with that.
MS. COFFIN:

Well, the language of the statute

says case, and -- and I think there -- I think -QUESTION:

Okay.

You're back to that argument,

5

but on that argument, you know, what's a case depends on

6

the context.

7

MS. COFFIN:

I also think that there is a -- a

8

reason that can be discerned from their retroactivity

10

QUESTION:

Well, in your -- in your answer to

11

Justice Scalia, you said, well, you're not sure about the

12

harm, but the harm exists, it -- it seems to me, in not

13

giving full effect to the congressional scheme.

14

the Congress obviously thought that this was a -- that

15

AEDPA was a preferred regime, and you are delaying what

16

Congress has found a preferred regime.

17

that sense, maybe not the harm in a particular case that

18

would come out one way or the other, but you are delaying

19

the effectiveness of -- of a congressional scheme.

20

MS. COFFIN:

The --

So it's a harm in

But Congress chose to determine

21

that not everyone would be immediately affected --

immediately affected by AEDPA, and they --

Well, of course, for -- for the

reasons given.

We -- we want -- we want cases that

have -- where the merits have been addressed to be decided

MS. COFFIN:

2

Justice Kennedy, I believe that, in

3

fact, the -- the cases that were in the pipeline, this

4

finite number of cases, were exactly the cases -- not the

5

154 cases, but the 153 capital cases that were in the

6

pipeline that Congress was aware that they were

7

pre-petition cases, petition cases, various kinds of

8

cases.

statute would be interpreted in a way so that anyone that

And if they wanted to make sure that it -- this

10

place, but that had not filed a petition yet, all they had

to do was put the word petition in.

13

are bound by what Congress did.

14

they want --

15

QUESTION:

And I believe that we

I understand that

But -- but that -- but that's just

16

not true that -- that we give a word the same meaning in

17

all contexts.

18

many instances of that, that your argument cannot --

19

cannot rely just upon that.

20

other courts that have come out the other way from the

21

Ninth Circuit have done so for a very sensible reason, and

22

that is that there is nothing to be gained, nothing

23

whatever to be gained, by refusing -- or by -- by refusing

24

to apply AEDPA to these pre-petition activities inasmuch

25

as AEDPA cannot affect them at all.

We -- we evidently don't.

There are so

And it seems to me all of the

1

MS. COFFIN:

Well, if -- to give you a brief

2

answer, on the other -- on the other circuits, the fact of

3

the matter is none of them analyzed this in terms of

4

Congress' intent at the time that they wrote AEDPA and how

5

they were informed by McFarland.
However, even if this Court is not convinced

6
7

that Congress' awareness of McFarland is dispositive as to

8

the meaning of case pending, Garceau had a case pending

9

pre-AEDPA under this Court's definitions of what

10

constitutes a case.
Prior to AEDPA, Garceau had begun the process of

11
12

challenging a State conviction and death sentence in part

13

by filing in the district court a pleading detailing two

14

fully exhausted claims of Federal constitutional

15

violations.

16

to raise claims and challenge a State conviction and death

17

sentence.

just mentioned with their factual and legal foundation

19

which were ripe for adjudication.

21

presented viable grounds for habeas corpus relief.

Garceau sought and received counsel in order

He filed a document detailing the two claims I

The district court made

Under Hohn, we believe Garceau had a case

pending.

The determination in Garceau's case is very

24

analogous to the judicial determination in Hohn concerning

the COA application.

No, but not -- not to any decision

that is taken before the filing of the -- of the formal

made a difference, no.

QUESTION:

And I guess the answer to that could

affect a later determination in the case.
MS. COFFIN:

3

I don't know.

I would concede that, in fact, in

4

this case and I think all the pipeline cases, that even if

5

AEDPA had applied at the time that the case originated,

6

there would not have been a different determination in

7

terms of those early proceedings.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MS. COFFIN:

However, the -- the point I'm

10

trying to make now is that even if this Court doesn't

11

believe that -- that case pending can be determined by

12

looking at McFarland and Lindh, I think that the -- what

13

Hohn has identified as what is needed for a case is, in

14

fact, found in the Garceau case and that's because of the

15

proceeding that Garceau followed where he actually filed

16

what could have been a petition had that name been put on

17

it.

18

QUESTION:

Can you specify what were the

19

pre-petition -- I thought that there was -- there was also

something submitted by counsel, a kind of skeletal

statement of issues, and -- and because there was an

Counsel then -- there was a stay before counsel was

I'm sorry.

What I was thinking is

17

that if the standard for reviewing the State court

18

determinations is different, depending on whether you

19

apply AEDPA or not, I don't see why, in principle, that

20

couldn't affect the outcome of a judge's decision as to

whether the issue in the petition in front of me is or is

22

not a frivolous issue.

-- and the outcome of an early stage

MS. COFFIN:

Well --

Well, in fact -- in fact, in this

7

case there probably would have been a different

8

determination at least as to one of the two issues that --

9

that Garceau put forward.
QUESTION:

10

I wasn't even aware that these things

11

were reviewable.

You -- you mean to say that you get

12

judicial review of whether, when counsel is appointed,

13

the -- the trial court allows counsel to proceed with a

14

habeas?

You -- you can take that up on judicial review?

15

MS. COFFIN:

ultimately is reviewed is the -- is the substantive

MS. COFFIN:

No.

I -- I don't believe so.

In

20

fact, had the district court determined that there were no

out of court.

determined that, in fact, it was a frivolous issue because

There are factual issues put forth.

11

The factual and legal foundation of the claims that --

that are in the Specification of Non-frivolous Issues are

But I think that there's an additional question

15

that -- that needs to be examined, which is, is what

Garceau filed, under this Court's precedent in Hohn, a

case?

The Ninth Circuit didn't apply

So you're saying even if AEDPA had

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been -- had been applicable, your client still should have

2

prevailed.
MS. COFFIN:

3

No.

What -- what I'm suggesting is

4

that AEDPA should not be applied to Garceau either because

5

of the first argument that I made about McFarland, or if

6

this Court is not satisfied that, in fact, Garceau had a

7

case pending, which is the language from Lindh that

8

determines whether or not AEDPA should be retroactive.
And I'd like to make one other point, which is

9
10

that there are -- it is a finite number of cases that were

11

in the pipeline.

12

you had to be post-State court determination and in

13

Federal court and somewhere along in -- in the process in

14

Federal court in order to be in this sort of bubble area.

15

And I think -QUESTION:

16

It's a very unusual situation.

In fact,

Well, Lindh was a similar case, was

it not?

18

MS. COFFIN:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but it was non-capital.
I have a question about this -- the

20

proceeding.

21

the counsel that represented this petitioner was the same

22

counsel who represented him in the State court.

23

that so?

24
25

AEDPA was pending when this was going on, and

MS. COFFIN:

Actually not.

Isn't

What happened was

and neither counsel that -- there were two counsel that

2

participated at one point or another in State court, but

3

neither participated in the whole case and neither was

4

lead counsel.

5

court appointed two new counsel who had some familiarity

6

with the case.

And so lead counsel was unavailable and the

QUESTION:

7

Knowing that AEDPA was on the front

8

burner, counsel having some familiarity with the case, why

9

did they use all the time that the district court gave

10

them instead of filing before AEDPA went into effect?
MS. COFFIN:

11

Well, there were a number of

12

reasons for that.

The first is that in State court,

13

they -- there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary

14

hearing.

15

money and there was no mechanism by which counsel could

16

pull together an entire petition.

17

agreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court.

18

However, the district court set forth a schedule

There was no mechanism -- there was very little

And the district court

19

by which funds would be -- would be given, and those

20

funds -- you did some investigation, you got -- you

21

satisfied the district court, you got more funds.

22

last funds were not -- were not given to counsel until,

23

I believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks

24

before the petition was filed.

25

The

So that's one reason.

The other reason is that counsel had to make a

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

determination, under this Court's precedent, whether or

2

not it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the

3

best petition that could possibly be made and because it

4

would be possible that it might not have been able to be

5

amended.

6

And so -QUESTION:

Ms. -- Ms. Coffin, you -- you have to

7

make the best argument for your client here, and -- and

8

you're doing that.

9

But it strikes me that -- that there -- this is

10

sort of a mixed bag, that actually, in agreeing with you,

11

we would probably be -- be harming most capital

12

defendants, that is to say, your client will win on this

13

retroactivity point which will eventually vanish.

14

a -- it's a temporary problem.

15

It's

But the effect of our holding that -- that the

16

habeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the --

17

the initial request for counsel is that all -- all of the

18

transactions -- I mean, if -- if that provision that all

19

factual determinations by the State court must be deemed

20

to be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future,

21

apply to those -- to those determinations.

22

came out the other way, until the habeas application is --

23

is applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't -- are -- are

24

not applicable.

25

a -- not a win-win game, but it is for your client, I

Whereas, if we

So, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's not

35
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

suppose.
MS. COFFIN:

Well, actually, Your Honor, since I

3

have clients in many different positions here, I actually

4

don't believe that it would be a problem for other capital

5

defendants, and I do believe that it's the correct result

6

on either basis that I have put forth for Garceau.

7

QUESTION:

Because even under AEDPA, if you just

8

come in at the threshold, the court -- the Federal court,

9

in general, is quite liberal about letting you develop the

10

facts necessary to present your claim.

11

problem with amending a petition in habeas, but your

12

point, I take it, is that you can't envision any real harm

13

to any of your clients if the starting date of AEDPA would

14

be considered the filing of the stay application and the

15

request for counsel.

16

MS. COFFIN:

17

QUESTION:

It may be a

No.
May I just ask one question?

The --

18

the proceedings that took place between the appointment of

19

counsel, which involved the -- whether the -- the

20

statement as to the kind of issues and so forth and the

21

State's motion to vacate the stay and so forth -- were

22

they all given the same number that Justice Ginsburg

23

referred to earlier?

24
25

And then after the habeas application itself was
filed, was the case given a different number, or was the

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

same number continued?
MS. COFFIN:

This case has only had one number

in district court, and it is one of the kind of ironies of

all of this.

5

very obvious.

6

7

case and that's your case number.

that Garceau had all the way through his district court

proceedings.

10

I would have thought that the word case is
You go to district court.

You have a number.

They stamp your

That's your district court
And that's the number

He then got a different number stamped on

his case by the Ninth Circuit when he was on appeal --

11

QUESTION:

Oh, yes --

12

MS. COFFIN:

-- but there's been one -- one

13

number all the way through and you don't get a get a

different number when you file a habeas petition.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

QUESTION:

Thank you, Ms. Coffin.

Ms. McLean, we've been talking about

21

the statement of non-frivolous issues that's filed.

In

22

your view -- and I -- I would assume, at least for

23

purposes of my question, that AEDPA might make a

24

difference, that it might be non-frivolous before AEDPA,

25

but -- but then frivolous after.

I'm assuming that could

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be true because of clear -- clear and convincing evidence

2

standing, for instance.
MS. McLEAN:

3

Your Honor, I respectfully disagree

4

with that.

There's nothing in AEDPA that applies

5

whatsoever to the pre-application period.

6

provisions of 2254(d) can only apply once an application

7

is filed by its express terms.

8

QUESTION:

9

district court is interested.

The deferential

Well, I'm -- I -- I take it the
That's because they --

10

that's why they require this filing -- whether or not

11

there's going to be anything here for the court to

12

adjudicate.

Is there some substantial issue?

13

And the point of my question was going to be

14

let's assume that post- and pre-AEDPA, the standard of

15

frivolity changes.

16

Would you say that there is an expectation that's

17

legitimate and that exists if there's a filing of a

18

statement of non-frivolous issues pre-AEDPA and then

19

before the complaint is filed -- before the petition is

20

filed, AEDPA comes into effect?

21

expectation has been established?

Let's assume that.

MS. McLEAN:

22

No.

Or non-frivolity.

Would you say an

And the reason for that is

23

that that document that is filed is so skeletal that it

24

absolutely bears no resemblance to a -- ultimately to a

25

petition.

Its sole purpose is to satisfy the local

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

district court rules that require that there be some

2

showing for the court to exercise its discretion in

3

issuing a stay.

4

This Court recognized that requirement, or at

5

least a -- the discretionary nature of the State grant in

6

McFarland.

happens.

8

way the local rules in -- in California work are that they

have to file the statement -- a specification of non-

by Mr. Garceau that that was treated as any sort of a

petition --

In

It -- it doesn't -- it's not

There was no expectation whatsoever

QUESTION:

16
17

It doesn't ask for habeas relief.

The only expectation is you'll get a

stay until you file your petition.
MS. McLEAN:

18

Exactly.

That was its sole

19

purpose.

There's absolutely nothing that is in --

20

contained in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the

21

pre-application proceedings.

22

QUESTION:

Well, why -- why --

23

QUESTION:

Would you just confirm for me the --

24

the language of 153 applies to an application for a writ

of habeas corpus.

Okay.

That's (d) and also (e) in a

provision in 21 U.S.C. 848 specifies that there's an

QUESTION:

So you think instituted by an

application for a writ of habeas corpus means just that.

20

It has to be instituted by the application.

21

MS. McLEAN:

It's extremely explicit.

And it

22

also is consistent with how we're treating all other

23

habeas cases.

24
25

QUESTION:

Can you -- forgetting the -- the --

I -- I'm still slightly confused on what I'd call the

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

practical point.

Imagine on January 1, before AEDPA is

2

passed, they file a petition -- no, not a petition --

3

a petition for a lawyer.

4

And everything under the sun is litigated on that stay

5

application, as it often is in a capital case.

6

once the stay was granted, they file their official habeas

7

petition.

8

question is whether AEDPA will govern future proceedings

9

in the case.

And there's stay applications.

On December 1, AEDPA is enacted.

On June 1,

Now, the

And what we've said is it doesn't govern

10

those future proceedings if, in fact, that petition had

11

been filed on June 1.

12

MS. McLEAN:

13

Right?
Well, this Court hasn't -- that's

what this case -QUESTION:

14

No.

I'm saying the petition for

The habeas is pending as of the time that AEDPA

15

16

was there.

17

The petition for the lawyer and so forth was filed

18

6 months before.

19

up that.

20

The petition for habeas was filed on June 1.

Am I right?

MS. McLEAN:

Am I right?

Maybe I mixed

I -- I -- in all -- the only cases

21

that this Court has addressed is in the non-capital

22

context, and you have -- you've said that AEDPA applies

23

once the filed petition is -- if the filed petition

24

occurred prior to the enactment of AEDPA --

25

QUESTION:

If the filed -- the habeas petition

applies -- was filed, and habeas proceedings are underway,

2

and then later on AEDPA is enacted, does AEDPA apply?

MS. McLEAN:

MS. McLEAN:

Yes, the habeas petition.
-- the application for merits is

filed before --

QUESTION:

MS. McLEAN:

Once -- if the habeas petition --

Before AEDPA.
-- the enactment of AEDPA, yes,

there -- that is not an AEDPA case in --

10

QUESTION:

Thank you.

11

Now, what I'm saying is -- is January 1, they

12

ask for a lawyer and then they go through the stay.

13

June 1 they file the habeas petition.

14

AEDPA is enacted.

15

because the habeas proceeding was underway.

On

On December 1,

Now, we don't apply it to that case

16

MS. McLEAN:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.
All right.

Why don't we?

Because

18

that judge might have made up his mind about various

19

things because there could have been things decided.

20

why isn't precisely the same thing true as to the period

21

January 1 to June 1, where all kinds of things were

22

decided, the stay was litigated, the judge has made up his

23

mind, who knows how it affected the future proceedings?

24

That's what -- do you see the question?

25

MS. McLEAN:

I do.

MS. McLEAN:

What's the answer?
Respectfully, though, I believe

that that ignores the express wording of -- of AEDPA.
QUESTION:

I get the linguistic point.

That's

5

why I said that I wanted to know the practical point,

6

which I think maybe Justice Kennedy's question was trying

7

to get at; I'm trying to get at.

8

MS. McLEAN:

Practically also, there is no --

9

whatever litigation might occur with regard to the State

10

proceedings has nothing to do with the merits of the case

11

which is what AEDPA goes to.

12

The fact that this was tremendously litigated State

13

proceedings doesn't decide any issues that ultimately will

14

be affected by AEDPA.

15

QUESTION:

So there can be no harm.

So there's no harm whatsoever.
Well, you -- you described the -- the

16

State proceeding as, quote, tremendously litigated, close.

17

What did that -- what did that involve?

18

MS. McLEAN:

And in our -- I'm not saying that

19

that happened in our case.

20

don't have -- there's virtually no litigation involved.

21

I think that usually they

In this case, what happened was that they're

22

required under our local rules to present the

going to be raised.

They didn't file anything.

What they

constitutional claims that would be made.

rules.

And so, it was that -- that was the sum total of

And we objected

It

Wasn't there also a request for

funds?
MS. McLEAN:

10

There was -- there was a request

11

for funds under -- there was a request for funds under

12

848.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And that was before the -- before the

habeas corpus petition was filed, yes.
MS. McLEAN:

That's correct.

Under 848 because

16

of -- it's part of that -- or that post-conviction

17

proceeding that was construed in McFarland.

18

QUESTION:

I thought what had happened here was

19

that the petitioner asks for a lawyer and a stay, and then

20

the district court granted the stay.

21

in and said, we want you to vacate the stay.

22

the district court asked the petitioner to file the non-

23

frivolous issues, et cetera, and so there was a

24

considerable argument about whether the stay should be

25

vacated or not vacated, which I guess eventually the

Then the State came

I think -It sounded to me like a fairly

substantial proceeding.
MS. McLEAN:

I think that overstates the

situation.

7

QUESTION:

What is it now?

8

MS. McLEAN:

We filed papers that objected to

9

the fact that the stay had been granted based on a

10

failure -- failure to comply with the local rules.

11

filed papers that stated that and the court ruled against

12

us because they corrected the deficiency, and that's all

13

that happened.

14

QUESTION:

And we

But you say that whether or not this

15

case is governed by AEDPA, AEDPA has no effect whatever on

16

all of that.

17

MS. McLEAN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

AEDPA does -By its terms, it simply does not

affect it.
MS. McLEAN:

That's correct.

And that is really

21

demonstrated -- also another a twist on that is that an

22

848 appointment, by its very terms -- if you look at

23

848(q)(9), I believe is the provision, it talks about how

24

a -- how the appointment of counsel survives the habeas

25

proceeding.

It goes on.

The appointment continues on

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

into clemency proceedings and competency proceedings and

2

other things.

3

track.

4

that habeas corpus proceeding under chapter 153, and then

5

it survives and may go on into other areas.

So clearly this is sort of an independent

There's an appointment of counsel.

It includes

It also would survive the dismissal of a

6
7

petition.

We've had experiences in the Ninth Circuit

8

where the petition that ultimately ends up being filed is

9

deficient.

It gets dismissed out.

They go back into

10

State court and they've allowed them to continue with that

11

appointment of counsel.

12

clearly is a separate phenomenon.

And so it continues on.

13

QUESTION:

But doesn't it --

14

QUESTION:

Suppose Garceau had filed a

It

15

handwritten thing, and he called it petition for habeas

16

corpus, and it had the same thing as the statement of

17

issues?

18

MS. McLEAN:

I think he would have -- if --

19

assuming that it had been -- asked for relief and stated

20

at least one claim with a summary of facts, fact pleading

21

that's required --

22

QUESTION:

Would there have been a problem then

23

for counsel, once counsel is appointed?

And my scenario

24

is Garceau files his own petition, it's handwritten, and

25

it's got one -- one issue.

Then the lawyer is appointed,

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and a Dandy petition is filed with 28 issues.

2

that -- would be any problem about that being considered a

3

successive petition?

4

MS. McLEAN:

No.

Would

In my experience with the

5

Ninth Circuit, they're very liberal in that situation.

6

occurs frequently.

7

a -- a petitioner is initially unrepresented and files a

8

limited petition, the court's very liberal about granting

9

the ability to amend the petitions later.

10
11

It

Especially in non-capital cases where

They're not

considered successive.
QUESTION:

Is it ultimately beside the point

12

that AEDPA itself doesn't say anything about this -- the

13

so-called pre-petition, the stay stage?

14

stay is dependent upon the Specification of Non-frivolous

15

Issues, and frivolousness has some reference to the

16

standards that you're going to have to meet for success

17

and AEDPA affects those standards, doesn't, as a matter

18

of -- of implication, doesn't AEDPA affect your

19

frivolousness standard and hence have at least a potential

20

effect at the stay point?

21

MS. McLEAN:

Because if your

Your Honor, I don't believe that

22

that's the case.

The -- the non-frivolous issue

23

standard -- very low.

24

that there's some colorable claim, that -- that the stay

25

is not being just granted on something that has -- that is

They're just trying to make sure

just air.

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MS. McLEAN:

They want something there so that

4

the court is reasonably exercising its stay discretion

5

and -- and appointment of counsel discretion.

6

That's a substantially -- that's unaffected, in

7

my opinion -- unaffected and substantially different than

8

the question that comes up once the merits petition is on

9

file, and we're looking to see whether or not this is --

10

this is -- there's a valid constitutional violation -QUESTION:

11

Oh, I -- I quite agree.

But if -- if

12

the State decided that it simply was going to be less

13

complacent at the stage at which there is a request for

14

stay and said, okay, we're going -- we're going to start

15

contesting the non-frivolous character of these -- these

16

claims that are being raised, number one, wouldn't the

17

State be able to do that if it thought it was worthwhile

18

to spend its time doing that?

19

that, wouldn't the ultimate standard of persuasion that

20

AEDPA applies have an effect on -- on the argument that

21

you would make as to what was or was non-frivolous at that

22

stage?

23

MS. McLEAN:

And number two, if it did

A State could do that.

The --

24

I don't believe, again, though, that AEDPA has any

application to that.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

looking at at that phase is whether there's enough to

2

justify the stay.

3

The -- AEDPA goes to the issue of whether the --

4

you know, what the State court adjudication of the claim

5

was and whether it was a -- involved a reasonable

6

application of Supreme Court precedent and an entirely

7

different analysis.

8

a) any intent to affect that, or any actual effect

whatsoever from changing the deference that's ultimately

I don't believe that there was,
