ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has made clear that conspiracy is an

12

inchoate offense, the essence of which is the agreement to

13

commit an unlawful act.

14
15

QUESTION:

What does the word inchoate mean?

I

realize you're getting it from our opinions, but --

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

18

it means an uncompleted offense, activities that have not

19

yet progressed to the point of having violated a

20

substantive provision of the criminal law, yet which

21

represent a sufficient step to warrant legal intervention

22

under the doctrine of either attempt or conspiracy.

23

QUESTION:

24

offense, I assume, is it not?

25

It's the opposite of a choate

QUESTION:

it?
MR. DREEBEN:

3

Justice O'Connor, under the drug

statute, this Court held in United States v. Shabani that

5

there is no requirement of proof of an overt act in order

6

to punish a drug conspiracy.
QUESTION:

7
8

When does the conspiracy terminate,

in your view?
MR. DREEBEN:

9

The conspiracy terminates, Justice

10

O'Connor, either when the conspirators achieve the

11

objective that they have agreed to carry out, or when they

12

have abandoned efforts to do so.

Scalia.
QUESTION:

Suppose one of them knows that it's

no longer possible and he leaves the conspiracy.
MR. DREEBEN:

That individual will -- in order

23

to accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do

24

more than simply leave it.

25

on withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the

2

existence of the conspiracy either by going to law

enforcement, or by communicating to his fellow

of it.
But the termination of the participation of one

6
7

co-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or

8

telling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy.

The very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals

who have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and

15

continues.

18

Other members may drop

But so long as there is a common agreement to commit

QUESTION:

What if all but one drop out?

Does

a -- does a conspiracy continue as to that one?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this Court has never

19

addressed the question, and I could find no cases in the

20

common law that had addressed the question.

21

under the common law, you cannot have a unilateral

22

conspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have

23

allowed that.

24
25

Certainly

There may, however, be policy reasons to hold
that once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture,

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

even if all of the other conspirators are arrested and

2

give up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still

3

soldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators

4

have abandoned it, might properly be held liable for

5

seeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy.

6
7
8

10
11

QUESTION:

It's a conspiracy of one, so to

speak, right?
MR. DREEBEN:

If such an animal exists, it would

be a conspiracy in which all members but one have
abandoned the objective.
In a case like this, however, where what happens

12

is that two members of a multi-member conspiracy are

13

arrested, one of them becomes a Government agent, the

14

other one perhaps does not -- and it's not clear that he

15

did abandon the efforts to accomplish the goals of the

16

conspiracy -- but there are many others at large who are

17

continuing to carry out the conspiracy, the criminal

18

agreement persists.

19

And where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong

20

foot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its

21

goals have been defeated.

22

conspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought,

23

the conspiracy is over.

24
25

When the object of the

That, however, is contradictory to the
fundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry

2

out an unlawful act, and to take the --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, what about --

4

QUESTION:

Would you -- would you tell me what

5

the conspiracy was that survived the -- the claimed end of

6

the conspiracy?

What -- what -- conspiracy to do what?

MR. DREEBEN:

7

Conspiracy to distribute and

8

deliver marijuana and cocaine.

9

QUESTION:

Was it the marijuana and cocaine that

10

had already been seized by the Government, or some other

11

marijuana?
MR. DREEBEN:

12

As the case comes to this Court,

13

the conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to

14

distribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been

15

seized.

16

But what's crucial is that those conspirators

17

who remained liable were entirely unaware that the

18

Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of

19

the conspiracy.

20

And I think that the hypothetical that makes

21

clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance

22

where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting

23

operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering

24

to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to

25

pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that the Government is offering.

2

the Government has no intention and never had any

intention of delivering actual drugs.

unlawful.
QUESTION:

And the difference between an attempt

12

and the conspiracy, in the attempt you need a dangerous

13

probability of success or something along that line, but

14

you don't need that in a conspiracy case.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

Conspiracy

16

intervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens.

The

17

traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need

18

the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial

19

step towards its completion.

20

always required a little bit more activity on the part of

21

the defendant before the Government can intervene and

22

penalize it.

23

have some corroborating evidence that the defendant

24

actually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to

25

avoid penalizing something as a thought crime.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, the first trial in this

2

case described a narrower conspiracy, did it not, than was

3

involved in the second trial?

4

the difference was in the conspiracy charge initially

5

made, and the conspiracy charge in the second trial?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

And would you explain what

Well, the conspiracy charge,

7

Justice Ginsburg, remained the same in both.

In the --

8

the indictment was not changed.

indictment that alleged the conspirators formed an

It was a single

10

agreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by

11

November 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent

12

to distribute cocaine and marijuana.

13

In the original trial, the parties were unaware

14

of the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus

15

Cruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the

16

Government challenges here.

17

on the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory

18

that respondents could be held liable for joining that

19

conspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become

20

couriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho.

21

They did not know that the drugs had actually been seized

22

earlier by the Government and that the Government was

23

watching them.

24

meant that what the Government had argued in the first

25

case no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy

And it, therefore, proceeded

So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz

liability.
QUESTION:

2

Is -- is there a temporal component

3

to your argument?

If the initial defendants had been

4

arrested and detained for a month and then they got around

5

to the sting operation, would it still be a conspiracy, or

6

does it lapse after some reasonable time?
MR. DREEBEN:

7

It doesn't lapse through a period

8

of time, Justice Kennedy.

What could cause the conspiracy

9

to end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of

10

the objectives of the conspiracy.

11

of the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in

12

Arizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on

13

the delivery end -- had all concluded that something has

14

gone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared,

15

they could have abandoned the narrowest version of the

16

conspiracy -QUESTION:

17

In other words, if all

But so long as one of the end

18

delivery people didn't know about it and thought that the

19

drugs were still on the way, he could continue to recruit

20

people and so forth even if the principals had been in

21

jail for a month and the drugs had been seized for a

22

month?

23
24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the people who were in jail

were the couriers, not the principals.
QUESTION:

Well, let's -- let's -- all right.

But even those -- some couriers had -- had been in jail.
MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, because so long as those

3

individuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still

4

trying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is

5

still alive.

6

Government sting where there's never any drugs in the

7

outset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact

8

for the conspirators to successfully accomplish.

9

it is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a

And as the -- as in the case of the

But if

10

Government sting at the outset, then surely the

11

Government's intervention in midstream doesn't

12

automatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law,

13

which is what the Ninth Circuit held.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. --

15

QUESTION:

But explain again what you mean now?

16

If, instead of cocaine, it had been powdered sugar, can

17

there be a conspiracy conviction?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, it would depend

19

on whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the

20

Government under the representation that it is cocaine, or

21

whether the defendants are actually seeking to move

22

powdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move

23

powdered sugar.

24
25

QUESTION:

No.

They think they're -- they have

a load of cocaine and that was their intent, but

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

unbeknownst to them, it's powdered sugar.
MR. DREEBEN:

Liability.

Because the -- the

3

question of conspiracy liability is judged by what the

4

actor perceives to be the facts.

5

QUESTION:

How is that different from an

6

agreement to receive stolen goods and then we find out

7

the -- goods are not stolen?

8

actionable I -- I had thought.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

That's -- that's not

Well, it is the same, Justice

10

Kennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal

11

courts is that it is.

12

and when the conspirators or the person who's attempting

13

to commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and

14

takes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst

15

to him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't

16

complete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of

17

the objective.

18

QUESTION:

That would be a mistake of fact,

Well, if -- for a conspiracy

19

conviction, I mean, because the whole -- the whole purpose

20

is to prevent people banding together for wicked purposes,

21

but if -- if there's no conspiracy involved and he's

22

mistaken in the fact, I assume there's no crime.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

The -- the modern rule,

24

Justice Scalia, is that there is a crime.

In this

25

country, the earliest case that addressed it and the case

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that all of us are familiar with from law school is People

2

versus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906.

3

And that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has

4

described it -- that if the person is receiving what he

5

believes to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen,

6

he is not liable.
But the modern focus on attempt law is on the

7
8

intent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact

9

that unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that

10

prevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does

11

not defeat his liability for an attempt.
In other words, attempt law and conspiracy law

12
13

have, to an extent, converged on the policy that the

14

importance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous

15

actors.

16

QUESTION:

What case would you cite to us for

17

this notion under attempt law?

18

from this Court?
MR. DREEBEN:

19

Is -- is there anything

There -- the only thing that there

20

is from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions

21

that have addressed the obstruction of justice statute,

22

Unbeknownst to him, the

Does the Model -- Model Penal Code

take a position on this?
MR. DREEBEN:

12

Yes.

The Model Penal Code goes

13

very far in the direction of the intent-based focus of

14

attempt law and conspiracy law.

15

there is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or

16

law.

17

In the Model Penal Code,

What the Model Penal Code does, however, is

18

allow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to

19

craft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce

20

the grade of a crime or to dismiss it.

21

And the Model Penal Code was thinking about

22

hypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that --

23

that anyone has actually found, such as where an

24

individual believes that he can kill through incantations

25

and voodoo and sets about to do so.

Well, what -- what's the difference

between being inherently impossible and the other kinds of

MR. DREEBEN:

Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code

13

rejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent

14

impossibility and said that it's really something that

15

should go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a

16

crime or dismiss it.

The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made

12

cases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is

context, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon

their efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are

In this case, for example, one of the two

That shows that although the conspiracy

in your view continues -- B, C, D -- but A has withdrawn?

19

Is that what it shows?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

What it may show is that the

21

statement wasn't made in furtherance of the conspiracy.

22

If he's simply talking to his neighbor, it may not be

doing anything to carry out the aims of the conspiracy.

A has never been arrested?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

Right.

The statement to be

3

admitted as a statement of a co-conspirator must be both

4

during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.

5

So to continue your hypothetical, if you suppose that

6

A comes out, and then tries to communicate through

7

intermediaries that he knows where the drugs are and that

8

people should take efforts to secrete them before the

9

authorities seize them, then that statement could be

10

admitted as a co-conspirator's declaration.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Dreeben, could we just clarify

12

this particular case?

13

when the two people involved -- the proof as to them goes

14

only from the next day on?

they're part of began presumably much before that.
MR. DREEBEN:

Actually, I -- I think the -- the

way the case comes to this Court, the involvement of the

22

two couriers begins on November 19th, the day after the

23

drugs are seized, when they're recruited.

Yes, but they're charged with a

conspiracy dating from the 18th.

That's right.

MR. DREEBEN:

As the case comes to this Court,

5

that's right.

When -- when the case was charged, the

6

parties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just

7

charged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the

8

grand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence

9

by a particular date when it could be certain that it did

10

come into existence.

11

earlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date

12

uncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a

13

conspiracy in place and the following four individuals

14

were -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others

15

unknown to the grand jury.

16

It may have come into existence

Now, in light of the way the facts actually

17

panned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of

18

the Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove

19

pre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent

20

couriers, the indictment might have more accurately been

21

written to say that on November 18th, at least, a

22

conspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the

23

respondents joined it.

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,

agreement.

agreements.

1

you hadn't completed your answer to why it's okay that

2

even though the proof as to these two defendants starts on

3

the 19th, not on the 18th, it's okay to have the

4

indictment say they were participants from the 18th.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, if you read the

6

indictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th

7

and we didn't show that they were involved until the

8

19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what

9

we showed -- you have a variance between the allegations

10

of the indictment and the proof at trial.

11

law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant

12

if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the

13

indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is

14

within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included

15

conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no

16

prejudice from the variation.

17

And the settled

Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset

18

that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against

19

respondents was going to be the observation of them

20

driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona

21

supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and

22

driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho,

23

following which they were stopped and gave completely

24

unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving

25

around with a truck filled with drugs.

There was no

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prejudice to the defendants in defending against a

2

conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of

3

the 18th because those events were always going to be at

4

the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable.

5

So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the

6

allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does

7

not warrant any relief.
QUESTION:

8
9

But your -- your principal argument

is not in response to variance.

It's simply that on

10

the 19th they became -- excuse me -- they became part of a

11

conspiracy that had begun at least by the 18th.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That's correct.

That's -- that's the essence of your

position.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's -- the essence of our

16

argument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that

17

the evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles

18

of variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any

19

other fact-based, record-based analysis that would show

20

that the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in

21

the indictment.

22

What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding

23

in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the

24

Government intervenes and renders its completion

25

impossible.

And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy

2

alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as

3

a factual matter, over.

4

Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this

5

case is if the Government showed that respondents joined

6

the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they

7

were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other

8

drugs.

9

Circuit think that the Government could prevail.

Accordingly, the only way on the

Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth

And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was

10
11

not sufficient to prove either of those other

12

conspiratorial activities.

13

evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to

14

participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th,

15

when respondents showed up and got in the truck.

It never questioned that the

And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its

16
17

holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes

18

factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its

19

analysis also crumbles.
I'd like to save the remainder of my time for

rebuttal.

6

However, having said that, we would not wish to have it

7

taken that we abandon that argument.
Mr. Chief Justice, a number of the questions

posed seemed to go to the heart of what this case is

10

about.

11

that survived?

Justice Stevens asked, what was the conspiracy

The Government argues at length in the brief and

13

here today that -- notwithstanding the charge in the

14

indictment and the trial of this case below -- that by

15

November 18th, 1997, Mr. Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa could be

16

charged with the crime.

that the indictment framed what this case was about by

I -- I understand that,

Mr. Chief Justice, and -- and we do speak to that.
The -- the question was posed, What conspiracy

9

survives, and I'm suggesting that no conspiracy survived,

10

and that the answer is, is that the Government framed the

11

case as they would have it and that the issues that the

12

Government talks about here today and in their brief at

13

length as to when the -- these two late-comers to the

14

conspiracy enter -- came into it -- obscures that notion.

15

Your Honor -- or Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the

17

with all due respect, I don't think has been really argued

18

here much today by the Government.

19

correctly whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law

20

when the Government frustrates its objective.

The -- the question is

21

That is taken from the formulation of former

22

Chief Judge Browning in this case below that he -- all

23

they said was -- in describing the case here and referring

24

back to Cruz -- in Cruz we ruled that a defendant could

25

not be charged with conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs

after the law enforcement authorities had already

that intervention.
The Ninth Circuit didn't say that this was an

impossibility case, that it was impossible for the

evidence.
MR. SHURTLIFF:

Indeed, Justice Ginsburg, there

was sharp disagreement.

Justice -- Judge O'Scannlain and

8

eight other members of the court dissented from the -- not

9

granting the rehearing en banc.
However, what -- the point I seek to make, not

10
11

very well, apparently -- is -- is that what the court

12

below did not say was that it was impossible to have a

13

conspiracy, but that they added to abandonment and

14

accomplishment a new ability to frustrate or end the

15

conspiracy.

16

Government intervention that frustrates its objective and

17

that Government intervention invited the new participants

18

into it.

That is Government -- and -- and narrowly.

And Justice Ginsburg, you -- you inquired as to

what the Model Penal Code might say about that.

would suggest that in that regard, Wharton, in describing

3

And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was

saying in this case, that if we look at this historical

traversed that in its briefs and its reply brief -- that

MR. SHURTLIFF:

4

QUESTION:

Indeed, Justice Scalia.

But you say it does -- it is not a

5

criminal conspiracy if the reason there is no money in --

in the bank is that the Government has removed the money

from the bank knowing that there's going to be a -- a

8

break-in?
MR. SHURTLIFF:

9

There would be no conspiracy if

10

the Government had intervened in that conspiracy early on

11

and the involvement of the participants charged was only

12

as a result of that involvement.

So if the Government took the money

Indeed.

So you're saying it's like an

MR. SHURTLIFF:

It's -- it's similar to, but

different -QUESTION:

No, no.

It's not quite as strong as

18

an entrapment.

So what you're argument is, is that where

19

the Government has joined, thereby frustrating the

20

objective, and in addition brings about the circumstances

21

through which the later membership, A, B -- of my three

22

extra people take place, that's close enough to

23

entrapment, plus the fact that the conspiracy can't

exceed -- can't succeed.

and you have grounds for not convicting.

entrapment or enticement, and -- and that's -- I think

that -- and so I can't say that -- that that's part of the

predicate for how they got where they got -- went in this

QUESTION:

It relied on Cruz, and in Cruz it

all that remains is for a new recruit to be added.
But there is no reason given for that in -- in

Cruz.

There must be some legal doctrine that it rests

upon.

Impossibility or entrapment are the -- are the two

categories that we know.

That's not -- it

But, Mr. Justice Kennedy, the --

QUESTION:

I -- I --

Mr. Dreeben said that was a variance

The question is what did they join, and why should it make

MR. SHURTLIFF:

As far as they're concerned,

Justice Ginsburg, the -- the

19

question of variance is another one of those little things

20

that pop up and confuse some of us.

But the issue in this case, there was no

variance because the Government said, we indict you for

activity by November 18th, 1997.

these persons were engaged in this activity for either a

single load -- the load at issue -- or that they were

members of a larger conspiracy before November 18th, 1997.

4

QUESTION:

But that's not --

5

MR. SHURTLIFF:

6

QUESTION:

That's not variance.

-- that's -- that's not part of the

7

question before this Court.

The question before this

8

Court is whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when

9

the Government frustrates its objective.

And whether

10

there might be some other grounds that the Ninth Circuit

11

might have decided it on, that is not before us.

12

MR. SHURTLIFF:

And as to that issue, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, as we said it in our briefs and I said it in my

14

brief specifically, I believe, that the policy that's come

15

down through the -- through the -- conspiracy is not that

16

old -- that there is no good reason why the answer to that

17

question ought not be yes, that a -- that a -- it is

18

terminated as absolutely as if the conspiracy were

19

abandoned or if it were accomplished because there is no

20

good -- there is no chance of it being successful.

21

There's no chance of the unified activity creating the

22

dangers that we speak of and -- when we're -- when we're

23

trying to combat conspiracy.

that would also be true if the project was impossible from

Well, why doesn't that violate your

MR. SHURTLIFF:

MR. SHURTLIFF:

Thank -- thank you.
The

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretation and -- and law.

I suggest, and we suggest

2

that the decision below is not as far-reaching as it might

3

otherwise appear, that Justice Browning formulated a

4

result in this case that's much narrower than what we're

5

about.
But on the other hand, having said that, and

6
7

being here, the question is whether the Government

8

intervention in these circumstances, in these extant

9

circumstances, ought end the opportunity and the ability

10

to join a conspiracy.

We simply urge that frustration of

11

the purpose of the -- by the Government -- invitation to

12

join by the Government in these circumstances is no less

13

or is no more in keeping with the termination of the

14

conspiracy than would be had they -- some of the people

15

abandoned the conspiracy or had it been accomplished.
The Government argues that the answer to this

16
17

question, if we answered it in the affirmative, would

18

raise havoc with our ability to prosecute these kinds of

19

cases.

We would suggest that that's not the instance

20

here.

Here in -- here and in Cruz, as near as we can

21

tell, Cruz has been cited once; this case not at all.

22

It's not a set of circumstances that are likely to reoccur

23

often or with great --

neither of the participants at that point cooperated with

the police except to tell the police that their

3

instructions were to drive the truck to a certain place.

It was, Justice O'Connor.

instructions seem to say that -- one of two things.

2

can only find him guilty of the conspiracy if he joined it

3

prior to 1:18 a.m. on November 18th.

4

if you find there's a larger conspiracy, you can find him

guilty, but that larger conspiracy must be to distribute

conspiracies.

you send it back to the Ninth Circuit for a determination

applied in the facts in this case, would the decision

20

below remain the same.

Government's position in this case, that the -- that it

Assuming

I'm assuming Cruz is wrong, and then

it would seem to me the evidence is fully sufficient to

convict if Cruz is wrong because it doesn't make any

difference if they joined it before or after 1:18 a.m. on

12

the 18th.

13

QUESTION:

Can I ask another question?

Is

14

there -- is it conceivable that the jury found that the

15

evidence after the impossibility was sufficient to sustain

16

the verdict?

Because they weren't asked to find that.

17

I mean, I don't -- as I understand Mr. Dreeben's

18

argument, there was plenty of evidence later on, that they

19

joined the -- they joined an ongoing conspiracy, but the

20

charge didn't ask them to find that, as I -- maybe

21

Mr. Dreeben will comment on it in his rebuttal.

22

MR. SHURTLIFF:

I --

I -- I think that's entirely

23

correct, Justice Stevens.

The -- the jury wasn't asked to

24

find that, and the -- and the Government was very careful

25

in the way they tried this case.

We will show you that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
To address the jury instruction issue first, the

14
15

jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the

16

requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to

17

find whether there was evidence of respondents'

18

involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the

19

drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a

20

broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were

21

seized.

22

At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the

23

petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what

24

happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal

25

rule is incorrect.

And in essence, our position is that

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz

2

instructions also would have found that respondents were

3

involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that

4

they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up.

5

centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents

6

were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury

7

may have found that respondents were involved in a longer

8

conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from

9

the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the

10
11

That was the

respondents were also involved in this conspiracy.
Even if this Court didn't agree with that

12

rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note

13

that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find

14

insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the

indictment.

20

conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the

somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a

new trial.

That doesn't leave the Government with the

evolution of conspiracies.

3

versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs,

4

but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that

5

conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally

6

are not born full-grown.

7

successive stages which are necessary to bring in the

8

essential parties.

In a case called Blumenthal

Rather, they mature by

9

And in this case, two essential parties were

10

brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but

11

after events that the conspirators were aware of required

12

that new couriers were brought in.

13

that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew

14

that they needed new couriers.

15

Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one

16

conspiracy.

17

They were not aware

They brought them in.

Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model

18

Penal Code provisions.

The Model Penal Code at section

19

5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt

20

law and concludes that the defense should not be

21

recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for

22

conspiracy.

Finally -- thank you.
