ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The complaint in this case alleges that a

12

national bank charged excessive interest.

13

held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that

14

section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both

15

the exclusive standards governing the interest that a

16

national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial

17

remedies for any violation.

18

This Court has

And as a result, any claim that a national bank

19

charged excessive interest necessarily arises under

20

Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court

21

or Federal court.

22

reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a

23

national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or

24

deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the

25

Federal courts and may either be filed there by a

Any well-pleaded complaint would

2

plaintiff or removed there by a defendant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, normally when the Federal

3

Government creates a cause of action that preempts State

4

causes of action, it attaches an element to that cause of

5

action that does not exist under some of the State causes

6

of action.

7

against the owners and -- and managers of nuclear

8

facilities, but the cause of action must be based on

9

something more than mere negligence.

10
11

Let's say, it -- it creates a cause of action

It has to be

intentional malfeasance or gross negligence.

Okay?

Now, what if somebody comes in and brings a

12

cause of action in State court, alleging mere negligence

13

by the owners of the nuclear facility?

14

position that that case is removable even though it

15

wouldn't -- it wouldn't survive a motion to dismiss for

16

failure to state a claim under -- under Federal law?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Is it your

Justice Scalia, with respect, I

18

don't think that I would concede the premise of your

19

question, that is, that a Federal cause of action

20

ordinarily has an additional element.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

All right.

Well --

But leaving that aside --

Leaving -- in my hypothetical --

Your -- your hypothetical actually

Alderson Reporting Company

is an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with

2

respect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in --

3

has federalized the cause.

QUESTION:

MR. WAXMAN:

It created an express Federal

law standards will apply and it will be the law of

whatever State the incident occurred.
QUESTION:

10

But take my hypothetical.

you do in my hypothetical?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Is it removable or not?

If -- if --

Yes or no.
If -- if any -- I hope I can

remember your hypothetical.

15

What do

The --

The hypothetical is you plead a State

16

law cause of action that does not claim all of the

17

elements which are necessary for the Federal cause of

18

action.

19

dismissable.

20

So it's clear on the face of it that it is

MR. WAXMAN:

It is definitely removable.

It

21

definitely is completely preempted if it comes within the

22

scope of a cause of action that has been determined to be

23

exclusive.

24
25

Now, that's --

QUESTION:

It's very strange to say that you can

remove something that on its face does not constitute a

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Federal cause of action.
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, there may -- in

3

preemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the

4

margins about whether something is or isn't preempted.

5

This is a heartland case and the example -- the

6

hypothetical you're giving is let's say that State of

7

Alabama or the State of Delaware created strict liability

8

for excessive interest.

9

to be knowingly under section 86.

The Federal statute says it has
There is no question --

10

no question -- under this Court's decided cases that a

11

claim that a national bank charged excessive interest,

12

with whatever state of mind or lack of state of mind, is

13

governed exclusively by Federal standards and an exclusive

14

Federal cause of action and that --

15

QUESTION:

Right, but the question is whether

16

the consequence of that is that the State law cause of

17

action must be dismissed by the State court because it's

18

preempted, or rather, the consequence is that you can

19

remove into Federal court a pleading that plainly on its

20

face does not -- does not claim a Federal cause of action.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the --

It just seems very strange to me.
The -- the pleading -- the

24

complaint in this case on its face does satisfy the

25

Federal cause of action and --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I understand that.

I understand

2

that.

We're -- we're not talking about what happens here.

3

But I -- with regard to the general principle that you

4

want us to set forth.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

QUESTION:

I think --

That's -- what's -- what I'm

7

concerned about.

Is it that all cases automatically come,

8

or is it only those that -- that set forth a Federal cause

9

of action?
MR. WAXMAN:

10

It has to be one that if well

11

pleaded -- I mean, a -- on a removal -- on a notice of

12

removal, the Federal court is obligated, like any court

13

determining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as

14

if it were well pleaded.

15

complaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily

16

presented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded,

17

the court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that

18

claim.

19

guy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well

20

pleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question,

21

then you remand.

22

And if, when the court reads the

If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this

And it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean

23

to quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is

24

very straightforward is simply an application of this

25

Court's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original

2

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, is what you're

4

saying essentially there is a Federal claim or there is no

5

claim?

6

no claim.

Certainly the plaintiff doesn't want there to be
If there is a claim, it is necessarily Federal.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

Yes.

And that's what makes it removable.

It is treated as though it were well pleaded, when, in
fact, it's badly pleaded.
MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed.

And the -- the perplexing

12

thing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque

13

situation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus

14

briefs on both sides where this particular instance where

15

the plaintiff says usury under State law even though the

16

Supreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years

17

after the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is

18

no such State claim, we now have a -- a group of

19

plaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to

20

establish a right to plead something that in their own

21

case they say is only, quote, defensively preempted.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

If they had -And no one has -- I'm sorry.

If they had pled it correctly, they

could still be in State court, but the defendant could

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

remove.

2

Federal claim -- it arises only under Federal law -- it

3

could be brought in State court or Federal court.

4

In other words, this is not -- although it's a

MR. WAXMAN:

Correct.

There is concurrent

5

jurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has

6

explained.

7

are litigated to the merits in State court and instances

8

in which they're litigated in Federal court either because

9

they're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff

And there are instances in which these cases

10

could have here, or they're removed there as the

11

defendant.

12

And the other principle that this case reflects,

13

as I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal

14

question jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and

15

defendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they

16

choose, but the requirement that this Court has stated

17

over and over and over again that in -- in determining its

18

own jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the

19

complaint as well-pleaded.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles

21

me about -- about the proposal that you make and that the

22

Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case

23

that established this principle and in the ERISA case,

24

which is the only other case that has -- has held to the

25

same effect, those cases refer to this as being an

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

extraordinary, an unusual event.

But I don't think it's

2

going to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there

3

is created a Federal cause of action, and at the same

4

time, State causes of action are preempted, it may be

5

removed to Federal court.

6

unusual at all.

I don't think that will be

And I sort of looked upon the -- the Labor

7
8

Management Relations Act case as really sort of a -- a

9

platypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts

10

just didn't want these labor things to go into State

11

courts because they didn't trust State courts.

12

they said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create

13

this whole new law of -- of contracting, of collective

14

bargaining.

15

you're telling me it's really just a little piece of a

16

much broader proposition which is not at all -- not at all

17

narrow.

18

That's how I always regarded it.

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

And so

And now

Justice Scalia, I think it

19

actually is very, very narrow.

And we can go through in

20

detail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that

21

the -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact,

22

examples of complete preemption.

23

only in the instance where there is not only substantive

24

preemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal

25

cause of action, but the determination that that cause of

But it -- it comes up

10
Alderson Reporting Company

action is, in fact, exclusive.

And that is the difficult

and close question that this Court --

sense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice.

contending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make

State law, because there was no general Federal question

22

jurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law.

23

We're not

The relevant question and the relevant question

24

that this Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in

25

the ERISA context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

has substantively preempted the field or by conflict or

2

whatever.

3

of such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive?

4

And that, I think, is what this Court decided

Is the creation of the Federal cause of action

5

first in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the

6

borrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that

7

under New York State law, it was entitled to void not --

8

to forfeit not just the interest, but the note.

9

Court said, look, New York State law has nothing to do

And this

10

with this.

This is a claim of usury by a national bank.

11

The Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal

12

penalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note.

13

Only the interest.
QUESTION:

14

But -- but certainly under the -- the

15

statute itself did not preclude the possibility of that

16

action having been brought in State court.
MR. WAXMAN:

17

Not at all.

And in fact, it was

18

expressly contemplated.

that we have so far where we have recognized that there is

only a Federal cause of action, that cause of action could

have been brought just as well in State court, but it's up

25

to the defendant to remove it.

So we're not talking about

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

an exclusive Federal forum.
MR. WAXMAN:

For example, the

Copyright Act.

14

QUESTION:

Which is -- which is not this case.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

The Copyright Act certainly is an

example of complete preemption, but there's a statutory

17

provision that -QUESTION:

18

Okay, why didn't we express this --

19

this principle before instead of -- instead of adhering so

20

narrowly?

21

this -- this broad theory.

22

very much like the section 301, and the legislative

23

history referred specifically to 301, and therefore we

24

come out the same way.

25

I mean, even the ERISA case, it didn't express

MR. WAXMAN:

It says, this is -- this is

Pretty -- pretty narrow.
Here's -- here's why, Justice

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Scalia.

The very difficult -- this Court made clear in

2

Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it

3

wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very

4

lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of

5

action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would

6

displace State causes of action.

7

and longstanding presumption to the contrary.

There's a very strong

8

But that difficult question was decided in the

9

context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning

10

in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's

11

opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the

12

Government cites that precipitated the enactment of

13

section 30, which is that this was war legislation.

14

was a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by

15

Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the

16

means with which the Government could continue to fund the

17

war, and national banks would knit the country together

18

when the war was finished.

This

19

And the one thing that comes out of the history

20

of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is

21

that they feared, based on their experience with the first

22

bank of the United States and the second bank of the

23

United States, that jealous States, States that were

24

jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing

25

paper at the time, would engage in predations against the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

national banks that were created at the very same time

that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this

important Federal infant in its crib.

from congressional silence that a Federal cause of action

19

is to be exclusive.

And the other examples in -- in which -- in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

5

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

6
7
8

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For more than 125 years, it has been clear that

9

the National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of

10

action for a claim of usury against a national bank.

11

Because the National Bank Act provides the sole available

12

avenue of relief, any claim that a national bank has

13

committed usury can arise only under that Federal law.

14

The National Bank --

15

QUESTION:

16

I asked Mr. Waxman?

17

a claim of usury, but it does not contain all of the

18

elements necessary to make out a Federal cause of action?

19

Is that removable?

20

Can I ask you the same question that
What if -- what if the pleading makes

MR. ROBERTS:

A failure to state a claim on

21

which relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court

22

of jurisdiction over the claim.

23

state a claim wouldn't prevent it from being removable if

24

the -- if the claim was within the scope of the Federal

25

cause of action, if it was a colorable claim.

So the simple failure to

Well, it's not colorable.

one of the elements is just not there.
MR. ROBERTS:

If -- if the claim was not

colorable -QUESTION:

It -- it claims usury when -- when

7

what they charged was 3 percent and that would not violate

8

the Federal statute.

MR. ROBERTS:

If it doesn't, then it can remand

MR. ROBERTS:

15

Well, to the extent that the State

there were excessive interest charges by a national bank,

I wonder if you

Assume a case in which the plaintiff alleges

16

that 3 percent is usurious as a matter of Alabama law, and

17

under Federal law it must be at least 5 percent, say.

18

I understand it, that would be removable because he's

MR. ROBERTS:

There is no Alabama claim because

it is removable and then the Federal court would assert

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

Then the answer to Justice Stevens,

MR. CLARK:

The only claim that

Well, and again, that is a

15

defense -- the claim -- as the Court said in MetLife, the

16

touchstone is not whether or not preemption is obvious,

jurisdiction.

understand your argument completely.

2

But I think one can read section 86 as creating

an affirmative Federal cause of action, and one can argue

that that's the only cause of action that can be

prosecuted.

6

would it not -- not -- would you not have to say then that

is, is the fact that there's a Federal remedy provided, in

provide removal jurisdiction, the answer would be -- would

be no to that question.

QUESTION:

I'm still trying to get back to my --

2

I'm beginning to see what I think your answer is, but

3

please don't agree with me if you really disagree.
All right.

4

First, if I were to ask the

5

question, is there Federal law in the area?

6

question, does Federal law preempt State law?

7

MR. CLARK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

Ask the

Yes.

Ordinarily.
Yes, here.

Yes, well, you'll say

right here, but wait.
So you -- if I ask this question, is this

10
11

State -- Federal cause of action -- did Congress intend it

12

to preempt a State cause of action substituting the

13

Federal cause of action therefor?

14

prepared to say the answer to this question is yes.

15

MR. CLARK:

16

QUESTION:

I think now you're

Ordinarily preempt.
But you will answer the following

17

question no.

Is there an intent here by Congress that

18

this Federal cause of action that preempts the State cause

19

of action by substituting an exclusive Federal remedy --

20

is there an intent of Congress to allow removal when it's

21

pleaded?

The answer is we have no evidence of that.

22

MR. CLARK:

23

QUESTION:

The answer to that question is no.
And what they're saying on their

24

side -- and now this is exactly the issue between them and

25

the lower courts.

And indeed, there's language that's

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unclear in the lower cases -- is that we need evidence of

2

that latter point.

3

they're saying no.

That's what you're saying.

4

MR. CLARK:

5

QUESTION:

And

Well -They're saying, look, all you have to

6

have are the first three things I mentioned.

7

you decide that Congress has created a Federal action with

8

the intent that it provide an exclusive substitute for

9

this State action.

Stop there.

Stop after

Don't ask for any further

10

evidence of anything.

11

Congress never thinks of this sort of esoteric issue.

12

second, because there's just no reason.
Now, okay.

13
14

19

Now I get the -- the clash, and now

MR. CLARK:

I'm sorry if I -- I misunderstood

your question before.
QUESTION:

17
18

And

I can get the answer.

15
16

One, because you'll never get it.

No, no.

It's my fault.

I didn't get

it.
MR. CLARK:

And in fact, in the -- in Justice

20

Brennan's concurring opinion in the MetLife/Taylor case,

21

he said, you know, that -- that congressional intent is

22

the touchstone here, and that this Court would be well

23

served not to infer removal jurisdiction unless there is

24

some clear evidence of congressional intent to do so like

25

in an ERISA case or like in the LMRA case.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, I should perhaps have

2

asked this question of the other side, but they're not

3

going to have a lot of time left when they get back up.

4

I assume that it -- it is a given that merely

5

setting forth all of the elements of a Federal cause of

6

action in a complaint is not enough to provoke removal.

7

That is to say, if there is both a Federal cause of action

8

and a State cause of action which has the same elements,

9

if you plead those elements, which would constitute a

10

Federal cause of action, but you protest that you are not

11

asserting a Federal cause of action, you are only

12

asserting a State cause of action, that would not be

13

removable.

Would it?

14

MR. CLARK:

15

QUESTION:

No, it would not be.
Okay.

And that --

So we're -- we're talking

16

about a -- a distinctive rule here that where you set

17

forth the elements of a -- of a cause of action that you

18

do not assert to be a Federal cause of action, we are

19

going to allow it to be removed nonetheless.
MR. CLARK:

20

If -- if what the defendants are

21

arguing, it would be a new rule.

22

those same facts as a Title VII case.

That's where there's concurrent lawmaking authority, both

State and Federal.

Here the argument is there is no State lawmaking

authority.

There is no parallel source of law, State and

13

state a claim under either State law or Federal law.

3

But not usury.

I mean, you -- it's a

4

question of how you characterize this, but I think you

5

agree that on the question of usury, the Federal

6

legislation is conclusive and it was done, indeed, for the

7

very purpose of having national banks escape from whatever

8

jealous, mean legislation the State might pass.
So the only law -- I mean, the choice would be

10

if you want to say, yes, I want to stick with Alabama law,

11

12

You can't get past the door because there is no such

13

claim.

14

MR. CLARK:

If -- if the preemption, ordinary

15

preemption, is -- is applied, it -- it would -- applied as

16

it has been, it would be dismissed.

17

However, that is a wholly separate question from

18

whether the case arises under Federal jurisdiction.

a question of ordinary preemption that the State courts --

22

QUESTION:

It is

Why would a plaintiff want to bring

us a suit that inevitably must be dismissed?
MR. CLARK:

Well, and -- plaintiffs have

23

different reasons for pleading the things they do.

24

the well-pleaded complaint rule, of course, it's their

25

prerogative to rise and fall on the causes of action that

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

Under

1

they choose to plead.
However, I go back to the MetLife case which the

2
3

Court said it's not the obviousness of preemption defense

4

but the intent of Congress.

5

question over there, is why -- why go that extra step?

6

Well, because this Court has decided in MetLife that that

7

extra step is necessary to stop this slippery slope down

8

where every case that is removed out of a State court, you

9

now have this other layer of -- of litigation over, well,

10

is there another cause of action and -- and perhaps that

11

we have to find some -- we have to litigate over whether

12

it's an exclusive cause of action.

And I think in answer to the

And the answer to that is this Court has

13
14

provided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we

15

follow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the

16

language in the -- at the end of the Gully opinion saying

17

that what you need is a clear bright line limitation.

18

only where we find some clear congressional intent, such

19

as in the LMRA situation, such as in the ERISA situation,

20

do we make this extreme and extraordinary grant of field

21

preemption or complete preemption or whole preemption.
If there are no further questions, I will sit

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

question is yes, if there are --

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, the answer to your

What was my question?

Your question was if -- if you --

8

you said this would take time, and it will.

You pleaded

9

all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it

10

also -- it also satisfies a State cause of action.

11

Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that

12

rare instance, it is not removable.

13

If the

Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop

14

at point 3.

That is, you determine whether or not this is

15

the rare instance in which there's not only substantive

16

preemption but exclusive Federal remedies.

17

you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction.

18

It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction,

19

and therefore, the question is, does the complaint

20

well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action?

21

Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and,

22

if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court

23

indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under

24

the law that creates the cause of action.

25

action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's

And the reason

Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the

3

most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not

4

fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the

5

question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in

6

particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in

7

Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action

8

misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a

9

necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law

10

was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise

11

under Federal jurisdiction?

12

In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated

13

dicta that suggests that the answer is yes.

14

versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court

15

seemed to indicate yes.

16

the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that

17

the embedded Federal question has to be central to the

18

State cause of action and really important.

19

And in Smith

But in Moore versus Chesapeake --

And the result, as I -- as I think things stand

20

now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's

21

opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have

22

difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but
