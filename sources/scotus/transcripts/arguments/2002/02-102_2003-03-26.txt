v. Texas.

Mr. Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
The State of Texas in this case claims the right

12

to criminally punish any unmarried adult couple for

13

engaging in any form of consensual sexual intimacy that

14

the State happens to disapprove of.

15

It further claims that there's no constitutional

16

problem raised by a criminal statute that is directed not

17

just at conduct, but at a particular group of people, a

18

law that criminalizes forms of sexual intimacy only for

19

same-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State who

20

has -- has the right to make a free choice to engage in

21

the identical conduct.

22

Petitioners are two adults who were arrested in

23

a private home and criminally convicted simply because

24

they engaged in one of the forms of sexual intimacy that

25

is on the banned list in the State of Texas for same-sex

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

couples.
They bring two constitutional claims to the

2
3

Court today.

4

implicit in our concept of order of liberty, must be the

5

right of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be

6

free from unwarranted State intrusion into their personal

7

decisions about their preferred forms of sexual

8

expression.

9

justification under the Equal Protection Clause for a law

10

that regulates forms of sexual intimacy that are permitted

11

in the State only for same-sex couples, thereby creating a

12

kind of a second class citizenship to that group of

13

people.

14

First, among the fundamental rights that are

Second, there's no legitimate and rational

QUESTION:

On your substantive due process

15

submission, Mr. Smith, certainly, the kind of conduct

16

we're talking about here has been banned for a long time.

17

Now you point to a trend in the other direction, which

18

would be fine if you're talking about the Eighth

19

Amendment, but I think our case is like Glucksberg, say,

20

if you're talking about a right that is going to be

21

sustained, it has to have been recognized for a long time.

22

And that simply isn't so.

23

MR. SMITH:

The Court's cases, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, say that history is a starting point, not the end

25

point of the analysis.

And I think that it's important to

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

look at history as a whole and one of the errors that I

2

think that the Court made in Bowers v. Hardwick was only

3

looking at the issue in terms of homosexual sodomy and not

4

looking at the issue in general terms, which is the right

5

of everyone to decide for themselves about consensual

6

private sexual intimacy.

7

whole, you find a much more complicated picture.

8

all, you find that sodomy was regulated going back to the

9

founding for everyone and indeed the laws in the 19th

If you look at the history as a
First of

10

century didn't focus on same-sex couples, they focused on

11

particular --

12

QUESTION:

Well, you're getting to your equal

13

protection argument now.

14

The first is, your -- your -- your fundamental right

15

argument, which has nothing to do with equal protection?

16

MR. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Let's -- let's separate the two.

Well, Your Honor -So the same-sex/other-sex aspect

doesn't come into it -MR. SMITH:

I think it does come into it,

20

because if you're going to suggest that the state of the

21

law on the books in the 19th century is the touchstone you

22

have to take into account that in the 19th century at

23

least on the face of the law married couples were

24

regulated in terms of their forms of sexual intimacy that

25

were created for them.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

It may well be, but so were same-sex

3

MR. SMITH:

Indeed, they all were, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

So all same-sex couples could not --

2

couples.

5

could not perform this act lawfully.

6

need than that?

7

that and say, oh, but it was also prohibited for -- for

8

other sex couples, you're getting into an equal protection

9

argument, it seems to me, not a fundamental right

10

It was prohibited.

What more do you
When you go beyond

argument.
MR. SMITH:

11

I guess I'm suggesting Mr. --

12

Justice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this

13

State, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years

14

ago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter

15

of substantive due process in their personal sexual

16

expression in the home.

17

law on the books in the 19th century can't be the deciding

18

factor.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

That means that the state of the

They conceded it.

I haven't conceded

it.
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor.

That may well be true.

22

I was -- I was working with the assumption that there may

23

be Justices who -- of the view that married couples do

24

have such a right and I am suggesting that the real issue

25

here is whether that fundamental right extends outside the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

marital context into other unmarried couples who form

2

bonds and have -- and -- for whom sexual intimacy plays an

3

equally important role in their lives.

4

QUESTION:

Were you talking specifically about

5

this Eisenstadt against Baird where there was an unmarried

6

couple -- while there was an unmarried person and the

7

conduct in question would have been perhaps in the 19th

8

century, early 19th century, criminal?

9

about fornication?

10

MR. SMITH:

Are you talking

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

I think the

11

Court in -- has moved from Griswold to Eisenstadt -- has

12

moved in the contraception area outside of the marital

13

context to the unmarried context, certainly the right --

14

the qualified right to abortion applies to unmarried

15

people, as well as married people.

16

Court in -- in looking at this issue of the scope of the

17

fundamental right to make choices about sexual intimacy

18

ought to take into account not just the state of law on

19

the books in the 19th century but a couple of other

20

factors, one the change in enforcement in the last 50

21

years because the Court's fundamental rights cases all do

22

look at current laws, as well as 19th century law and also

23

even in the 19th century, the fact that there's no record

24

of active enforcement of these laws against conduct -- of

25

adults consensual occurring in the private setting and

And I think that the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that's true for married couples, it's true for different-

2

sex couples who weren't married, it's true for same-sex

3

couples.

4

country going back to the founding involves coercion, it

5

involves children.

6

doesn't involve the kind of conduct that's at issue here.

The enforcement of the sodomy laws of this

It involves public activity.

It

7

So you really have a tradition of respect for

8

the privacy of couples in their -- in their home, going

9

back to the founding and I think then what began to happen

10

in 1960 was a recognition that we should take that

11

tradition and -- and turn it into positive law on the

12

books.

13

And so you now had three quarters of the States

14

who no longer regulate this conduct for anyone based on a

15

recognition that it's not consistent with our basic

16

American values about the relationship between the

17

individual and the State.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it depends on what you mean by

19

our basic American values, to revert to what the Chief

20

Justice was suggesting earlier.

21

this case is whether we're going to adhere to -- in the

22

first part of the case, not the equal protection aspect.

23

It's whether we're going to adhere to what -- what we said

24

in -- in Glucksberg, mainly that before we find a

25

substantive due process right, a fundamental liberty, we

Really what's at issue in

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have to assure ourselves that that liberty was objectively

2

deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.
That's what we said in Glucksberg and we've said

3
4

it in other cases.

Or are we going to depart from that

5

and go to the approach that we've adopted with regard to

6

the Eighth Amendment, which is it evolves and changes in

7

-- in social values will justify a new perception of what

8

is called unusual punishment.
Now, why should we -- why should we slip into

9
10

the second mode?

11

had laws against flagpole sitting at one time, you know,

12

there was a time when it was a popular thing and probably

13

annoyed a lot of communities, and then almost all of them

14

repealed those laws.
Does that make flagpole sitting a fundamental

15
16

I'm -- I mean, suppose all the States

right?
MR. SMITH:

17

No, Your Honor, but the Court's

18

decisions don't look just at history, they look at the --

19

at the function that a particular claimed freedom plays in

20

the lives of real people.

21

an issue.

22
23

That's why contraception became

That's why abortion became an issue.
QUESTION:

I don't know what you mean by the

function it plays in the lives of real people.

24

MR. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

The Court has said that -Any law stops people from doing what

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

they really want to do.
MR. SMITH:

2

The Court has said that it's going

3

to use reasoned judgment to identify a realm of personal

4

liberty that involves matters of central and core to how a

5

person defines their own lives, and relates to key other

6

people.
It's about moral upbringing of children in the

7
8

home.

It's about procreation or nonprocreation in your

9

sexual relations with your mate.

It's about basic

10

questions of what kind of a family you're going to live

11

with and other intimate associations.
QUESTION:

12

Well, you say it's about procreation

13

or nonprocreation, but none of the cases that you have

14

talked about involved nonprocreation, did they?
MR. SMITH:

15

They certainly involved the right to

16

decide to engage in sexual relations with -- while

17

preventing procreation, that's what -- that's what

18

Griswold and Eisenstadt and Carey all say you have a right

19

to do.

20

beget children and then that right resides with unmarried

21

people as much as it resides with married people.

22

That there's a right to decide whether to bear and

And I submit to you that it's illogical,

23

fundamentally illogical to say that an unmarried couple

24

has a right free of State intrusion to decide whether or

25

not to have procreative sex or nonprocreative sex, but

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

doesn't have the right to be free from State intrusion --

2

free from a law that says you can't have any sexual

3

intimacy at all. There's a -- there's a jagged piece

4

missing from the edifice of this Court's substantive

5

fundamental rights jurisprudence.

6

QUESTION:

It doesn't say you can't have -- you

7

can't have any sexual intimacy.

8

sexual intimacy with a person of the same sex.

9

MR. SMITH:

It says you cannot have

This particular law does that, yes,

10

Your Honor, but certainly our -- our submission is that

11

fornication laws and -- and laws involving sodomy

12

regulation more broadly would be equally unconstitutional,

13

because they involve --

14

QUESTION:

But your position, as I understand

15

it, is even if you take the narrowest view of Glucksberg

16

and even if you say there's got to be a positive

17

historical sanction, that in fact there is no historical

18

-- no substantial historical evidence to the contrary

19

because, A, the -- the sodomy laws were not enforced

20

against consensual activity historically and B, they were

21

not aimed at homosexual as opposed to sodomy in general?

22

MR. SMITH:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Right.
Is that -- your historical point, you

say even if I accept your argument, I should win?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think first of

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

all that the positive law, the law on the books proves too

2

much because it intruded right into the marital bedroom

3

and that the record of enforcement which may be more

4

informative actually supports us rather than supporting

5

the notion that this is something that can be regulated.
QUESTION:

6

What do you mean by the record of

7

enforcement, that there were -- that what happened in this

8

case was an accidental intrusion of the police?

9

didn't come into the bedroom looking for people conducting

They

10

illicit sexual relations?

11

reason and happened to discover these -- these men in that

12

conduct.

13

They were there for another

What do you mean by lack of enforcement? The

14

police have not gone around knocking on bedroom doors to

15

see if anyone -- I mean -- this is not the kind of a crime

16

that the police go around looking for, but do you have any

17

evidence to show that when they -- when they found it

18

being committed, they turned a blind eye to it and did not

19

prosecute it?

20

MR. SMITH:

The evidence we have is the -- is

21

the absence of reported cases discussing arrests for that

22

kind of conduct.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's because it's -- it's an

24

act committed in private, and -- and the police respect

25

the privacy of -- of one's home, of one's bedroom, and so

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

they don't investigate and find it.
But it seems to me what you would need is

2
3

evidence that when the police discovered this matter, they

4

said, oh, well, these are not laws that we enforce.

5

don't see any evidence of that sort.
MR. SMITH:

6

I

Certainly it seems to us there's a

7

significance to the fact that it has never been treated

8

as, for example, drug use in the home has been treated.

9

And people do -- the police obviously do actively seek to

10

infiltrate homes to find that kind of activity, it's been

11

treated in a categorically different way.
QUESTION:

12

But perhaps --

To what extent can you characterize

13

it?

14

this line.

15

characterize it as saying that the history has gone

16

exactly the opposite direction than what's been suggested.

17

But if you go back to colonial times really, the laws not

18

only were different but look at the prosecutions.

19

they did prosecute people for sex crimes.

20

prosecute people for same-sex crimes.

21

across the history, it's only recently that people have

22

been prosecuted for same-sex crimes.

23

characterization?

24
25

I mean, the ACLU brief has a lot of evidence along
I -- and it seemed to me they want to

And

But they didn't

And then if you go

Is that a fair

What is the real record?

MR. SMITH:

The argument about 19th century

enforcement is that they didn't prosecute anyone for

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

private and consensual crimes involving adults, that they

2

worried about children, they worried about public

3

activity, they worried about coercion, but that they

4

didn't worry about same-sex or different-sex sodomy.

5

as to the equal protection point which I think I should

6

get to in my remaining time.

7

addition to intruding into that area of important

8

fundamental protections, limits its focus just to one

9

small minority of the people of the State of Texas.

Now

This is a statute which in

It

10

says that these specified forms of sexual intimacy called

11

deviate sexual intercourse are illegal only for same-sex

12

couples and not for anyone else in the State of Texas.

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, what about a statute that

covered both?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think that would be

unconstitutional under my first point, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SMITH:

Right.
I think there is a multiple --

19

multiply unconstitutional statute, because it does the

20

second thing as well, it says that --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, if the statute covered both,

would there be an equal protection argument?
MR. SMITH:

If there was a record of enforcement

24

almost exclusively as to same-sex couples, I think there

25

would be potential constitutional problems there, but the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

statutory language itself would not involve an equal

2

protection problem of the same sort that we're dealing

3

with here.

4

QUESTION:

5

statutes like that?

6

about adultery that don't cover sexual relations of one of

7

the married couple with someone else of the same sex?

8

they unconstitutional because of denial of equal

9

protection?

10

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Smith, aren't there a lot of
Aren't there statutes in many States

I don't know whether statutes

11

actually are written that way, Your Honor.

12

would make is that when a statute --

13

QUESTION:

What about rape laws?

The point I

There are --

14

there are rape laws that -- that only apply to -- to

15

male/female rape.

16

MR. SMITH:

That may be as well.

17

QUESTION:

You think that they're

18
19

Are

I think --

unconstitutional?
MR. SMITH:

I didn't suggest that they're

20

unconstitutional.

My point is that when a statute is

21

limited to one particular group of people, particularly a

22

minority of people in the State, that that limitation

23

itself has to be justified under equal protection, that

24

that's a classification of people, not merely a definition

25

of conduct.

And that if the -- if the justification of

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the line that was drawn here is -- is insufficient as a

2

matter of mere rationale basis analysis.
QUESTION:

3

Because --

I don't understand that. Suppose the

4

State has a rape law that -- that, you know, that really

5

requires the penetration of the female sex organ by --

6

which is the classic common-law definition of rape, and it

7

has no -- no law of -- about homosexual rape.

8

that that law would be unconstitutional?
MR. SMITH:

9

You think

I think it would have to be

10

justified by the State.

11

evidence that this is not a problem that needs to be

12

addressed or that the victims are more able to protect

13

themselves, they may have -- they may have -QUESTION:

14

They may well come in with

One step at a time?

This is -- or this is something that we find

15

common?

16

more -- more -- more -- more odious?

17

This is more

MR. SMITH:

Well, the one thing that I submit,

18

the Court, the State should not be able to come in to say

19

is we are going to permit ourselves the majority of people

20

in our society full -- full and free rein to make these

21

decisions for ourselves but there's one minority of people

22

don't get that decision and the only reason we're going to

23

give you is we want it that way.

24

unequal in their choices and their freedoms, because we

25

think we should have the right to commit adultery, to

We want them to be

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

commit fornication, to commit sodomy and the State should

2

have no basis for intruding into our lives but we don't

3

want those people over there to have the same right.
QUESTION:

4

I mean you you can put it that way,

5

but society always -- in a lot of its laws makes these

6

moral judgments, you can make it sound very puritanical,

7

the -- you know, the laws -- the laws against bigamy, I

8

mean, who are you to tell me that I can't have more than

9

one wife?

You blue-nose bigot.

Sure.

You can make it

10

sound that way, but these are laws dealing with public

11

morality.

12

ever told them they're unconstitutional simply because

13

there are moral perceptions behind them.

14

different from bigamy?

15

They've always been on the book, nobody has

MR. SMITH:

Why is this

First of all, the first law that's

16

appeared on the books in the States of this country that

17

singles out only same sex sodomy appeared in the '60s and

18

the '70s and it did not -- and it does not go way back,

19

this kind of discrimination.

20

protection of an institution that the State creates for

21

its own purposes and there are all sorts of potential

22

justifications about the need to protect the institution

23

of marriage that are different in kind from the

24

justifications that could be offered here involving merely

25

a criminal statute that says we're going to regulate these

Now, bigamy involves

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

peoples behaviors, we include a criminal law which is

2

where the most heightened form of -- of people protection

3

analysis ought to apply.

4

McLaughlin, Your Honor, where you had a statute that said

5

we're going to give an specially heightened penalty to

6

cohabitation, but only when it involves a white person

7

with a black person.

8

different, and the State there made the argument we're

9

merely regulating a particular form of conduct, and that's

This case is very much like

That interracial cohabitation is

a different form of conduct than -- than intro racial

11

cohabitation.

12

You're classifying people.

13

be justified.

And this Court very clearly said no.
And that classification has to

And this Court at many times said a mere

14
15

disapproval of one group of people, whether it be the

16

conduct.

That's why people legislate.
MR. SMITH:

And what this Court does under the

equal protection clause is -- is -- standard as a bull

is no rational justification for the line that is drawn.

Well, do you -- do you -- in order to

win under an equal protection argument, do you have to

2

apply some sort of heightened scrutiny?
MR. SMITH:

3

We certainly do not think we do,

4

Your Honor.

We think this fails rational basis scrutiny,

5

just as the law did in Romer, in Cleburne, in Moreno, in

6

Eisenstadt, all of those laws were thrown out under

rational basis scrutiny, because the State basically

didn't come up with anything other than we want it that

MR. SMITH:

Well, certainly Bowers is not an

discrimination.

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

I understand.

We had the same

problem in the last case --

3

MR. SMITH:

Three weeks ago, yes, Your Honor.

4

The -- but the Court in applying even the

5

rational basis standard has not been insensitive to the

6

reality of what the world is like, and to the fact that

7

some groups of -- some classifications tend to be

8

involving minorities that have had histories of

9

discrimination against them and that the overall effect of

10

some line-drawing can be very harmful.

11

the Court looked at the actual effects of the -- of the

12

amendment in the Constitution and all of the many ways in

13

which it caused harm.

14

it -- while it purports to just to regulate sexual

15

behavior, has all sorts of collateral effects on people.

16

People in the States who still regulate sodomy everyday

17

they're denied visitation to their own children, they're

18

denied custody of children, they're denied public

19

employment.

20

they're labeled as criminals merely because they've been

21

identified as homosexuals.

In Romer itself,

Here you have a statute that while

QUESTION:

And that we submit --

If you prevail, Mr. Smith, and this

23

law is struck down, do you think that would also mean that

a State could not prefer heterosexuals to homosexuals to

teach kindergarten?

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

I think the issue of -- of

2

preference in the educational context would involve very

3

different criteria, Your Honor, very different

4

considerations, the State would have to come in with some

5

sort of a justification.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

A justification is the same that's

alluded to here, disapproval of homosexuality.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think it would be highly --

highly problematic, such a -- such a justification.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SMITH:

Yes, it would?
If that were the only justification

12

that could be offered, there was not some showing that

13

there would be any more concrete harm to the children in

14

the school.

15

QUESTION:

Only that the children might -- might

16

be induced to -- to follow the path of homosexuality.

17

that would not be -- that would the not be enough?

18

MR. SMITH:

And

Well, I -- I think the State has to

19

have a greater justification for its discrimination than

20

we prefer pushing people towards heterosexuality.

21

amounts to the same thing as disapproval of people's

22

choices in this area and there has to be a more -- more

23

reasons and justifiable distinction than simply we prefer

24

this group of people, the majority, instead of this group

25

of people, the minority.

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

That

1

Justice Jackson in the railway express case said

2

very eloquently that the equal protection clause is an

3

important bulwark against arbitrary government because

4

it's there to make sure that legislators don't avoid

5

political retribution by imposing onerous burdens only on

6

one minority, but that in fact the majority will live by

7

the same rules as purports to impose on everybody else.
QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Smith before you continue down to

the equal protection line.

Your first argument was the

10

right of personal privacy in one's most intimate sexual

11

relations, you were asked and you didn't get a chance to

12

answer because you went back on your equal protection

13

track, you are asking the Court to overrule Bowers against

14

Hardwick.

I thought that was very --

15

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

We're asking you to overrule it and we think

17

that the right of -- of the fundamental right of unmarried

18

people to make these choices about private adult

19

consensual intimacy applies for different sex couples as

20

well as same sex couples and that Bowers was wrong for

21

essentially three reasons, first it posed the question too

22

narrowly by focusing just on homosexual sodomy, which is

23

just one of the moral choices that couples ought to

24

have -- that people ought to have available to them.

25

And second in its analysis of history, which I

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

think I explained already and third, and perhaps most

2

importantly, in the assumptions that the Court made in

3

1986 about the realities of gay lives and gay

4

relationships, the Court simply asserted in the Bowers

5

case that there's no showing that has been demonstrated

6

between the opportunity to engage in this conduct and

7

family.

8
9

And certainly while it may not have been shown
in that case or even apparent to the Court in 1986, I

10

submit it has to be apparent to the Court now that there

11

are gay families that family relationships are

12

established, that there are hundreds of thousands of

13

people registered in the Census in the 2000 census who

14

have formed gay families, gay partnerships, many of them

15

raising children and that for those people, the

16

opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in

17

the privacy of their own homes performs much the same

18

function that it does in the marital context, that you

19

can't protect one without the other, that it doesn't make

20

sense to draw a line there and that you should protect it

21

for everyone. That this is a fundamental matter of

22

American values.

23

So those are the three reasons we ask you to

24

overrule Bowers v. Hardwick as to the fundamental rights

25

aspect of the case and that we think that that is an area

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

where the Court should go -- should go back and reconsider

2

itself.
The Court has now left open for nearly 30 years

3
4

the question of whether anybody outside has a right -- has

5

a privacy right to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in

6

the privacy of their home.

7

And I submit to you, you know, while the Court

8

has left that unanswered, the American people have moved

9

on to the point where that right is taken for granted for

10
11

everyone.
Most Americans would be shocked to find out that

12

their decision to engage in sexual intimacy with another

13

person in their own home might lead to a knock on the door

14

as occurred here and a criminal prosecution.

15

And that -- that reality is something that the

16

Court needs to take into account and certainly in so

17

doing, it shouldn't -- in constructing its fundamental

18

rights edifice draw distinctions between gay couples and

19

other couples.

QUESTION:

You probably say the same about

adultery, you think adultery laws are unconstitutional?

22

MR. SMITH:

I think that the state has --

23

24

same way about that, you know.

25

to do, but I certainly don't expect a knock on the door

I mean think people probably feel the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

and go to jail for it.
MR. SMITH:

2

Your Honor, adultery is a very

different case.

4

protecting the marital contract which people voluntarily

5

take on.

6

It involves the State interests in

And -- and so in assessing.
QUESTION:

to the State?

8

generation, right?

Why is the marital contract important

Because it's the source of -- of the next

9

MR. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

Sure, the State is -And you think that there's not some

11

of the same thinking behind the conscious choice of the

12

State to favor heterosexual and marital sex over

13

homosexual sex?

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, I can understand a law which

15

says we're going to attempt to channel heterosexuals

16

towards marriage by making them -- making it illegal for

17

them to have sex without marriage.

18

that law under -- under that kind of rational which only

19

regulates same sex couples and says you can't have sex but

20

everyone else has a right to do that.

21

I can't understand

As for adultery and all of the other parade of

22

horribles which people have raised in their briefs, it

23

seems to me you've got to look at the individual interests

24

and the State interests and their dramatically different

25

in all of those cases incest, prostitution, all of

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

these -- bestiality, all of these things either there's

2

very little individual interests or there's very

3

heightened State interest or both, in all of those cases,

4

so the idea that by recognizing the right of all adult

5

couples to make choices like this in their own home the

6

Court is going to open up a whole can of worms, I submit,

7

is correct.
If I could reserve the balance of my time, Your

Mr. Rosenthal, we'll hear from you.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROSENTHAL, JR.

13

ON BEHALF OF TEXAS
MR. ROSENTHAL:

14
15

Give me just a moment. Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court.
The State humbly submits that enforcement of

16
17

Texas Penal Code Statute 21.06 does not violate the 14th

18

Amendment of the Constitution because this Court has never

19

recognized a fundamental right to engage in extramarital

20

sexual conduct and because there is a rational basis for

21

the statute sufficient to withstand equal protection

22

scrutiny.

23

I'd like to begin with a brief discussion of

24

substantive due process.

From a practitioner's

25

standpoint, it appears that the jurisprudence of this

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court appears to resolve the means by which the Court

2

entertains a claim of novel protected liberty interests.
Since the Constitution does not expressly

3
4

address the issue of privacy or of sexual conduct, we look

5

to the Court's precedents and to the history of our

6

people.
If a historical, traditional analysis applies,

7
8

it then serves as objective guideposts to guide this

9

Court, as long as those ideals and laws do not infringe on

10

fundamental rights.
The Court has maintained that designation of a

11
12

liberty interest is done -- not done with impunity.

13

only those interests that appear to be carefully

14

identified asserted rights should be drawn and should be

15

considered as liberty interests.

16

does not particularly show which rights the petitioners

17

are asking to uphold.
QUESTION:

18
19

by that.

20

uphold?

21

But

The record in this case

I -- I don't understand what you mean

Aren't we clear what right they're seeking to

MR. ROSENTHAL:

No, sir, they're -- they're

22

asking for the right of homosexuals to engage in

23

homosexual conduct.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Right.
But there's nothing in the

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

record to indicate that these people are homosexuals.

2

They're not homosexuals by definition if they commit one

3

act.

4

also violate this code if they commit an act of deviate

5

sexual intercourse with another of the same sex.

It's our position that a heterosexual person can

QUESTION:

6

Why aren't -- why aren't they seeking

7

to vindicate the right of either homosexuals or

8

heterosexuals to commit homosexual act?

9

does that make?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

10

What difference

The difference it makes is as

11

the -- as the record is set out, it does not really define

12

the issues such that the Court can actually give the

13

petitioners a -- a specific form of relief.
QUESTION:

14

But the -- the -- the statute, Texas
It has called this

15

has already decided that for us.

16

homosexual conduct, so whether it's a heterosexual person

17

or a homosexual person, the crime is engaging in

18

homosexual conduct.

19

MR. ROSENTHAL:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You don't even have to get to the --

21

as I understand it, you don't even have to get to the

22

characterization of homosexual.

23

defines certain acts committed by or together with

24

individuals of the same sex and that's your class, isn't

25

it?

The statute clearly

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROSENTHAL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, it is.

What more do we need?
We're -- the class actually is

4

people who violate the act, not classes of individuals

5

based upon sexual orientation.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I can see that your point

7

may have some relevance on the equal protection side of

8

the equation, some relevance, I don't think it may be

9

controlling.

It -- it doesn't seem to meet the arguments

10

that's made under the substantive liberty part of the

11

argument with reference to Bowers.

12

MR. ROSENTHAL:

13

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

It doesn't meet the petitioners'

14

argument with respect to Bowers versus Hardwick, which

15

they say should be overruled.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

16

Well, of course we -- we believe

17

that Bowers versus Hardwick is -- is good law.

18

substantial law and that this Court should not overrule

19

Bowers --

20

QUESTION:

It's

But that question is certainly

21

clearly before us.

22

convicted the people for these acts and you have to be --

23

you have to defend it.

24
25

I mean this is your statute.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, sir.

You

And it's our position

that Bowers versus Hardwick is still good law, that

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there's nothing that's changed about the fundamental

2

liberties or the -- or the history or traditions of our

3

country that should make the analysis in Bowers incorrect

4

any longer.

5

The petitioner also claims that the mores of our

6

nation have changed to the point where physical homosexual

7

intimacy is now part of the fabric of American values.

8

And it's our position this cannot be correct.

9

infer that various States acting through their legislative

Even if you

10

process have repealed sodomy laws, there is no protected

11

right to engage in extrasexual -- extramarital sexual

12

relations, again, that can trace their roots to history or

13

the traditions of this nation.

14

QUESTION:

Their basic argument, I think --

15

QUESTION:

I -- I'm sorry.

I didn't get that

16

argument.

17

responding to the argument that the morals haven't

18

changed, or that the morals have changed so that

19

homosexuality is now approved.

20

saying that there's no tradition?

21

that's a totally different argument from tradition.

22

mean, the -- the argument is tradition doesn't matter.

23

I thought you were going to say -- you were

MR. ROSENTHAL:

And you respond to that by
I mean, that's -I

Well, history -- tradition does

24

not matter in terms of whether or not it -- it can be a

25

protected liberty interest.

1

QUESTION:

Why -- why do you think that the

2

public perception of -- of homosexual acts has -- has not

3

changed?

Do you think it hasn't?

4

MR. ROSENTHAL:

5

QUESTION:

6
7
8
9

Yes, yes.

Do you think there's

public approval of it?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Of homosexuals, but not of

homosexuality activity.
QUESTION:

What do you base that on?

10

MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROSENTHAL:

13

QUESTION:

14

The public perception of it?

I beg your pardon?

What do you base that on?
Well, even --

I mean I think there ought to be some

evidence which -- which you can bring forward?

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

16

QUESTION:

Sure.

Like perhaps the failure of the

17

Federal Congress to add the sexual preference to the list

18

of protected statuses against which private individuals

19

are not permitted to discriminate, that addition has been

20

sought several times and it's been rejected by the Federal

21

Congress, hasn't it?

22

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, sir, and -- and in

23

addition, what I was trying to say by the fact that

24

various States have changed their position on sodomy,

25

they've done it through the legislative process.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

that's where we believe this belongs, is in the State

2

House of Texas, not this Court.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but I thought you were

4

responding to the argument that the public perception

5

hasn't changed.

6

disapproval of homosexual acts.

7
8
9

That there still is -- is a public

And you can't establish that by saying that the
States have repealed their homosexual laws.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, I think it goes back to

10

whether the -- where -- whether people in Texas and people

11

in the other States that had this law on their books

12

actually accepted through their representative government.

13

I think it comes down to the -- the actual people who --

14

who determine the consensus and mores of the State or

15

the -- or the elected legislators.

16

QUESTION:

Might there be a difference between

17

the people's willingness to prosecute something criminally

18

and the people's embracing of that as a fundamental right?

19

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, certainly.

And just

20

because someone has decriminalized sodomy doesn't mean

21

that they embraced that practice as something that ought

22

to be taught in the schools as was mentioned before.

23

QUESTION:

But the argument of -- of Bowers, to

24

overrule Bowers is not directly related to sodomy.

25

related, but not directly.

It's

It's that people in their own

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

bedrooms, which have their right to do basically what they

2

want, it's not hurting other people.

3

other side -- says Bowers understated the importance of

4

that.

5

relationship of the sodomy to families and in addition,

6

Bowers has proved to be harmful to thousands and thousands

7

and thousands of people, if not because they're going to

8

be prosecuted, because they fear it -- they might be,

9

which makes it a possible instrument of repression in the

It got the history wrong.

And they -- the

It didn't understand the

10

hands of the prosecutors.

11

argument that they're making.

12

wrong in theory, understating the constitutional value.

13

MR. ROSENTHAL:

14

QUESTION:

15

Now, that's the kind of
Harmful in consequence,

All right --

All right, now how do you respond to

that?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

16

Okay.

First of all, let me --

17

let me correct something that -- that's very minor at this

18

point, but the allegation was made in petitioners'

MR. ROSENTHAL:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

My question was, getting those sort

3

of three or four basic points, I would like to hear

4

your -- your straight answer to those points --

5

[Laughter.]

6

QUESTION:

-- because on their face, they're --

I mean, I'm not -- not a criticism, I mean, directly

8

responding, directly responding to the -- to the -- to the

9

question.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

10

Well, it's our position that the

11

line should be drawn at the marital bedroom, through which

12

we can -- through the law enforcement or anyone else

13

cannot pass unless something illegal happens inside that

14

bedroom.
QUESTION:

MR. ROSENTHAL:

25

You're right about that, but --

First of all, let me say --

-- as long as it doesn't hurt

anybody?

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROSENTHAL:

First of all, let me say that

2

consent may be alleged in this case, but consent is not

3

proven in the record in this case.

4

nothing in the record that shows that people are capable

5

of giving consent or that consent was, in fact, given, but

6

even given that, I -- I think that the -- that this Court

7

having determined that there are certain kinds of conduct

8

that it will accept and certain kinds of conduct it will

9

not accept may draw the line at the bedroom door of the

10

heterosexual married couple because of the interest that

11

this Court has that this Nation has and certainly that the

12

State of Texas has for the preservation of marriage,

13

families and the procreation of children.
QUESTION:

14

There's -- there is

Does Texas permit same-sex

15

adoptions -- two women or two men to adopt a child or to

16

be foster parents?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

17
18
19

I don't know the answer to that,

Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, in portraying what Texas sees

20

as a family and distinguishing both married and unmarried

21

heterosexual people from homosexual people, those things

22

wouldn't go together if the State at the same time said

23

same sex couples are qualified to raise a family.

24

adopt children, you can be foster parents.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I do not know what that Texas

law -- what the Texas law says in that regard.
QUESTION:

I think it would be relevant to your

5

argument that they're making -- that Texas is making the

6

distinction between kinds of people who have family

7

relationships and can be proper guardians of children and

8

those who can't.

9

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, again, Your Honor, we're

10

not saying that they can't be proper guardians and we

11

can't say that they can't raise children.

12

not the issue.

13

That -- that's

The issue --

QUESTION:

You're fairly certain that they can't

MR. ROSENTHAL:

It does not criminalize it, it

What about adultery?
I beg your pardon?

What about adultery?
Again, adultery is not penalized

in Texas, but it is certainly not condoned in Texas.

10

[Laughter.]

11

QUESTION:

All right, so you said -- you said

12

procreation, marriage and children, those are your three

13

justifications.

14

see what it has to do with marriage, since, in fact,

15

marriage has nothing to do with the conduct that either

16

this or other statutes do or don't forbid.

17

what it has to do with children, since, in fact, the gay

18

people can certainly adopt children and they do.

19

don't see what it has to do with procreation, because

20

that's the same as the children.

21

Now from what you recently said, I don't

All right.

I don't see

And I

So -- so what is the justification

22

for this statute, other than, you know, it's not what they

say on the other side, is this is simply, I do not like

24

thee, Doctor Fell, the reason why I cannot tell.

QUESTION:

Now, what is aside -- aside from

that?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

3

I think what -- what I'm saying

4

is -- and I had not gotten into the equal protection

5

aspect of the -- of the argument yet, but under the equal

6

protection argument, Texas has the right to set moral

7

standards and can set bright line moral standards for its

8

people.

9

believe that they can say that certain kinds of activity

10
11

And in the setting of those moral standards, I

can exist and certain kinds of activity cannot exist.
QUESTION:

Could they say, for example, it is

12

against the law at the dinner table to tell really serious

13

lies to your family?

14
15
16

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, they can make that a law,

but there would be no rational basis for the law.
QUESTION:

Oh, really.

It's very immoral.

I

17

mean, I know there's certainly -- it's certainly immoral

18

to tell very serious harmful lies to your own family under

19

certain circumstances and around the dinner table, some of

20

the worst things can happen.

21

[Laughter.]

22

But the -- the -- so Texas could go right in

23

there and any kind of morality that they think is just

24

immoral or bad, cheating, perhaps.

25

serious rudeness, et cetera?

What about rudeness,

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, again, if -- if Texas did

2

pass the law, it would have to -- have to show through

3

some rational basis test that it's rationally related to

4

some State interest.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Rosenthal, don't you think that

6

what laws a State may constitutionally pass has a lot to

7

do with what laws it has always been thought that a State

8

can constitutionally pass, so that if you have a 200-year

9

tradition of a certain type of law -- and I don't know of

10

a 200-year tradition of laws against lying at the dinner

11

table -- the presumption is that the State is within the

12

bounds of -- of the Constitution to pass that law in -- as

13

declaring what it has proscribed as contra bonos mores, a

14

term that's been in the common law from the beginning as

15

against good morals, bigamy, adultery, all sorts of things

16

like that, and isn't that determined pretty much on the

17

basis of what kind of laws the State has traditionally

18

been allowed to pass?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

19
20

Certainly.

And it goes -- it

goes to things as diverse as -QUESTION:

21

I don't suppose you're going to argue

22

that Loving against Virginia was incorrectly decided, are

23

you?

24

MR. ROSENTHAL:

And that was certainly a long

tradition that supported that -MR. ROSENTHAL:

But it also violated a

fundamental right.

4

QUESTION:

And that's the issue here.

5

[Laughter.]

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, sir.

And the fundamental

7

right that was asserted there is -- is a long-established

8

fundamental right that we don't -- we don't treat races

9

differently because we think that one's inferior or we

10
11

stereotype someone -QUESTION:

There was a constitutional text

12

there, wasn't there, with Loving versus Virginia.

13

thought there was something about a Civil War and no

14

discrimination on the basis of race.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, and the same with -- with

the case that was cited from Florida.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

a longstanding tradition of the history of Texas of sodomy

there a law in the books in 1803?

QUESTION:

1803 or the first date of the Texas

18

legislature's meeting, did they pass it at the -- at the

19

first meeting of the legislature?

20

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, certainly in the -- in the

21

1854 Penal Code, the -- the kinds of activity that -- that

22

were classified now as sodomy were against the law.

23

However, I think to address your question --

24
25

QUESTION:

When did -- when did they single out

homosexual sodomy?

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

MR. ROSENTHAL:

In 1973, in the passage of the

1974 Penal Code.
QUESTION:

3

So the issue here doesn't have much

4

of a longstanding tradition specific to this statute, does

5

it?

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, not specific to -- not

7

specific to that statute, but it has a longstanding

8

tradition in Texas as being something that should be

9

proscribed and something that is regarded as immoral and

10

unwholesome.

11

QUESTION:

12

in Texas from when?

13

just to that.

14

homosexual -- but homosexual sodomy included, and that law

15

goes back how long?

16
17
18

Well, homosexual sodomy was unlawful
There was not a statute addressed

It was addressed to sodomy in general, but

To 1803?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

To the -- to the time that Texas

was a republic, before it -QUESTION:

But what about the statute which this

19

Court I think once had to grapple with, people felt during

20

World War I that it was immoral to teach German in the

21

public schools.

22

every right to do that, parents want their children to

23

learn German, but the schools forbid it?

24

question here is can the State, in fact, pass anything

25

that it wants at all, because they believe it's immoral.

So then would you say that the State has

See, the hard

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

If you were going to draw the line somewhere, I guess you

2

might begin to draw it when the person is involved inside

3

his own bedroom and not hurting anybody else.

4

that now -- so you say it's morality.

5

people do believe that that's a question of morality.

6

Many do not, but nonetheless, what can you add to what

7

you're saying, other than simply asserting its morality?

8

Because I don't think you think that the State could pass

9

anything in the name of morality?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

10

Now that --

I -- I agree many

Certainly not.

But it would

11

have -- any law that would pass would have to have some

12

rational basis to the State interest.
QUESTION:

13
14

You've not given a rational basis

except to repeat the word morality.
QUESTION:

15

Is the rational basis is that the

16

State thinks it immoral just as the State thinks adultery

17

immoral or bigamy immoral.

18

QUESTION:

Or teaching German.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that --

20

[Laughter.]

21

QUESTION:

Maybe we should go through counsel,

QUESTION:

Isn't the -- Mr. Rosenthal, isn't the

22
23

yes.

24

thrust of Justice Breyer's question that when -- when the

25

State criminalizes behavior as immoral, customarily what

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

it points to is not simply an isolated moral judgment or

2

the moral judgment alone, but it points to a moral

3

judgment which is backed up by some demonstration of harm

4

to other people.
We -- we've heard questions for example about

5
6

harm to a -- a marital institution.

It makes sense to say

7

whether you think the law is enforceable or not.

8

sense to say that adultery threatens the -- the durability

9

of a particular instance of marriage.

It makes

What kind of harm to others can you point to in

10
11

this case to take it out of the category of simple moral

12

disapproval, per se?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

13

Well, part of the -- part of the

14

rationale for the law is to discourage similar conduct,

15

that is, to discourage people who may be in jail together

16

or want to experiment from doing the same kind of thing

17

and I think -- and I think that the State can do that.

18

People can harm themselves and still be -- and still have

19

it be against the law.

20

that.

21

QUESTION:

But they can take drugs and do

Well, do you point to a kind of harm

22

here to an individual or to the individual's partner,

23

which is comparable to the harm that results from the --

24

the harm to the deterioration of the body and the mind

25

from drug-taking?

I mean, I don't see the parallel

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

between the two situations.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

2

Well, not -- not only do we say

3

that morality is a basis for this, but of course the

4

antecedents have raised that there may also be health

5

considerations.

QUESTION:

6
7

I don't know whether there are or not.
That is not the State's claim in any

case?

8

MR. ROSENTHAL:

9

but I can't say that it's not true.

10

That's not the State's claim,
Obviously this --

this has -QUESTION:

11

Did you read -- I don't know -- I

12

can't remember now who filed it, but there was one medical

13

brief filed on that subject and the argument there was

14

that, in fact, these laws are -- are directly antithetical

15

to health claim.

16

make on that brief?

Do you -- do you have any comment to

MR. ROSENTHAL:

17

Yes, sir.

There was a law filed

18

on behalf of the respondents that took exactly the

19

opposite position.
QUESTION:

20

So the issue was open, so far as --

21

as we're concerned that that would be your position, I

22

take it?

23
24
25

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, sir, for each expert

there's an equal and opposite expert.
QUESTION:

But you're not saying the State of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Texas is doing this for -- to protect the actors who are

2

involved in this?

3

to see that people don't harm others or themselves.

4

You're not suggesting that that's the reason for -- for

5

this particular law?

One can say the State is taking action

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

7

right to prohibit certain conduct.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, I think Texas has the

But if that's the reason for it, why

doesn't Texas prohibit the conduct in a heterosexual

10

relationship?

11

because if there were a harm, beyond moral disapproval,

12

the law would not be restricted to homosexuals.

13

I mean, it doesn't seem to be any harm

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, because heterosexual

14

conduct is -- the same kinds of conduct -- and by the way

15

it's not distinguished, it's still called deviate sexual

16

intercourse with heterosexuals.

23

QUESTION:

But it's not prohibited?
But it's not prohibited.

Yeah.
But it also can lead to marriage

And that's -- and that's a legitimate

But -- but procreation -- many people

24

with the blessings of Texas can have sexual relations who

25

are unable to procreate, so I don't see how -- whatever

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the line might have meant in times gone, it certainly

2

isn't true that sexual relations are for the purpose of

3

procreation and anything that is not for that purpose is

4

beyond the pale.

5

You can't make that distinction.

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

No, but I think as a matter of

7

public policy, the State can make -- have -- can have

8

preferences -- and again it doesn't say that simply

9

because heterosexual people can -- can have deviate sexual

10

intercourse, the State approves it.

11

other sanctions that the -- that the State may imply.

12

There are just simply

I did want to briefly distinguish this case from

13

your decision in Romer v. Evans.

And obviously the

14

distinction there was -- was that the Colorado amendment

15

sought to classify people based on their orientation and

16

not their conduct.

17

certain class of people from the political debate.

18

on the contrary, Texas welcomes all into the political

19

debate and -- in the last Texas legislature, fortunately

20

our legislature meets only every other year, but in the

21

last Texas legislature, there was a hate crime statute

22

passed which made it a more heinous crime to make someone

23

a victim of crime based upon their sexual orientation and

24

it included all sexual orientations.

25

homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals, all, so I don't

And by so doing, they excluded a
Now,

It included

think we can say across the board that there's some sort

2

of Texas policy that we're trying to overall discriminate

against -- against homosexuals as a group.
QUESTION:

5

political process, run for political office who is

homosexual and the charge is made on the other side don't

breaker, there is a closer connection to Romer in that

9

charged as law-breakers.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

No, ma'am, they can't be charged

19

only be charged as law-breakers if they commit that

particular act.

And then, again, the State does not allow

I'm sure it's obvious to this Court that the

23

issues of homosexual rights are highly emotional for the

24

petitioner in these quarters but equally anxious in this

25

Court's -- for this Court's decision are those who are,

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

number one, concerned with the rights of States to

2

determine their own destiny, and, two, and possibly more

3

important, those persons who are concerned that the

4

invalidation of this little Texas statute would make --

5

would make marriage law subject to constitutional

6

challenge.

7

Then again, how far behind that can there be

8

other acts of sexual gratification brought for

9

constitutional challenge also.

There's already movements

10

to lower the age limit of consent for children engaged in

11

sexual practices.

particularly in Texas law, where we are a common law state

13

and the common law is based upon community property shared

14

by both spouses.

in this case, so as not to disenfranchise 23 million

I

1

just have a couple of points to make.

2

address this question of what it was that we proved in the

3

record below and whether or not we have, as a result,

4

adequately teed up the issues before the Court without

5

having put into evidence directly that this was a

6

noncoercive act or a noncommercial act or a nonpublic act

7

or things of that kind.

8
9

I thought I might

Our position is that this is a criminal statute
that has only two elements, it has a list of particular

10

kinds of sexual intimacy that you're not allowed to engage

11

in and it they have to prove as well that the two people

12

involved were of the same sex.

13

There was a complaint that was filed that listed

14

those two elements.

15

those two elements but said that there is an insufficient

16

basis for imposing criminal liability on them, because,

17

first of all, they invade fundamental rights and second of

18

all, because the law is discriminatory, while it's

19

supposedly got a moral basis, it's a discriminatory

20

morality, a morality imposed only on one category of

21

couples in a State which does not penalize in any way

22

adultery, fornication or sodomy for people of -- of

23

couples that are different sex.

24
25

My clients pleaded no contest to

Those are the arguments that were made and -- so
our position is that that the statute is unconstitutional

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

both facially and as applied here, because the State

2

purports to impose liability based on those two elements

3

alone and that they are constitutionally insufficient

4

bases both for fundamental rights reasons and because it's

5

a discriminatory state.
The other point I thought I might just address

6
7

for the moment is the public health rationale which didn't

8

come up before.

9

think this comes out to a large extent, it's undisputed in

Essentially, what the facts are -- and I

10

the amicus briefing -- the issue is not briefed in here

11

because the Texas brief doesn't even attempt to make this

12

argument, but it is -- the facts are that if this was the

13

line between safe and unsafe forms of sexual intimacy it's

14

as if the law cuts right across it.

15

the most safe forms of sexual activity possible,

16

including, for example, lots of safe sex -- same-sex

17

activity involving women and leaving completely

18

unregulated all sorts of forms of unsafe sexual activity

19

involving different sex couples.

Regulating some of

So if there was ever a case of a law where the

20
21

fit is egregiously improper and insufficient to justify

22

the law under the rational basis test, this would be such

23

a case.
