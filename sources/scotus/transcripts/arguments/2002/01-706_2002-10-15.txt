ORAL ARGUMENT OF LESLIE A. BRUECKNER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. BRUECKNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

10
11

State common law tort claims that a boat engine was

12

defective because it lacked a propeller guard are

13

preempted either by the Boat Safety Act of 1971 or by an

14

unpublished Coast Guard letter stating that the agency had

15

decided not to take any regulatory action with respect to

16

propeller guards.
There is no express preemption here because the

17
18

Boat Safety Act includes a savings clause that expressly

19

preserves the availability of common law claims.

20

light of this clause, this case boils down to the question

21

of whether our claims are impliedly preempted because they

22

conflict with some valid expression of Federal law.

23

the answer to this question is no for two distinct

24

reasons.

25

And in

And

First, as the United States has argued, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Coast Guard letter itself lacks the force of law

2

regardless of its content.
And second, even if the Coast Guard could

3
4

preempt State law in this fashion, there's no preemption

5

here because our claims are entirely consistent with the

6

Coast Guard's stated reasons for not taking any regulatory

7

action with respect to propeller guards.
QUESTION:

8
9

What would happen if there were no

savings clause in this case?
MS. BRUECKNER:

10

If there were no savings clause,

11

our position is that there would still be no express

12

preemption because section 4306 of the Boat Safety Act, by

13

its terms, in our view does not encompass common law

14

claims.

15

But the savings clause -QUESTION:

Well, except that -- that this clause

16

is different, say, than the one we had in Geier.

17

Geier clause -- savings clause begins -- or preemption

18

clause begins with the assumption that there is a

19

regulation.

20

may not have any regulation unless it's consistent with an

21

existing Federal regulation.

22

This begins the other way.

MS. BRUECKNER:

The

It says the State

That's true, Your Honor, but

23

here, as in Geier, reading this preemption clause as

24

encompassing common law claims would render the savings

25

clause of this statute superfluous, and that is exactly

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the result that this Court rejected in Geier.
QUESTION:

2

Well, suppose a State said there can

3

be a common law action in the courts of this State for the

4

violation of any safety regulation which this legislature

5

proposes, and we hereby direct that there be a propeller

6

-- a guard on every propeller.

7

valid under -- under 4306?
MS. BRUECKNER:

8
9

Would that statute be

In our view that statute would

be valid because we read 4306 as not even preempting State

10

positive law, that is, laws and regulations, unless

11

there's an actual Coast Guard standard.

12

need not resolve that -QUESTION:

13

But this Court

But -- but 4306 doesn't require a

14

Coast Guard standard.

15

disability on the State legislature unless there is a

16

Coast Guard standard and that State statute is parallel to

17

it.

18

It -- it says that there's a

MS. BRUECKNER:

Section 4306 in our view can be

19

read -- read two different ways.

20

statute is that it only kicks in where the Coast Guard has

21

regulated.

22

reads 4306 as expressly preempting all forms of State

23

positive law, that is, laws and regulations, even where

24

the Coast Guard hasn't regulated.

25

One, our reading of the

The United States disagrees on this point and

But the United States and we agree that however

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you read 4306 with respect to State positive law, common

2

law claims are preserved, and the reason is that 4311(g)

3

would be stripped of any meaning if 4306 is read as

4

encompassing common law claims.
QUESTION:

5

Not -- not when -- I mean, that's why

6

I think yours is the better view, actually.

7

on your view you needn't drive a wedge between the common

8

law and positive law because there's meaning for both.
MS. BRUECKNER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And I've never -- I guess it's a

11

better question for the Government.

12

want to drive a wedge between those two.
QUESTION:

13

But I mean,

I don't see why you'd

Well, let's -- let's take the

14

Government's position which is that the State could not

15

pass a statute on a -- requiring a propeller -- a

16

propeller guard.

17

that, why is it that a jury should be able to require the

18

same thing?

If -- if that's true, if we accepted

MS. BRUECKNER:

19

Because that is what Congress

20

made clear in section 4311(g) that juries should be able

21

to do.

22

Jury -QUESTION:

Ms. Brueckner, here's -- here's my

23

problem with 4311(g).

You can -- it not only is a savings

24

clause for common law, it's also a savings clause for

25

State law.

It says it does not relieve a person from

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

liability at common law or under State law.

Now, I -- I

2

do not know how an intelligent Congress could have --

3

could have written such a thing.

4

at common law or under State law.

But that's what it says:

Now, you can't read the savings clause portion

5
6

that says under State law to mean all State law because

7

then the savings clause would totally cancel the

8

preemption clause.

Right?

MS. BRUECKNER:

9

QUESTION:

10

I agree, Justice Scalia.

So you -- you have to limit State law

11

to mean, well, not all State law.

12

not be natural to read common law also not to include all

13

common law, for example, not including any common law that

14

specifically imposes liability for failure to have certain

15

propeller standards?
MS. BRUECKNER:

16

And why -- why would it

First, Your Honor, the fact that

17

this savings clause is slightly broader than that at issue

18

in Geier, because of the reference to State law, is not a

19

reason to construe it narrowly.
Second, the reference to State law can easily be

20
21

understood as a reference to, as the statute itself says,

22

liability imposed under State law, which we read to mean a

23

reference to State damages statutes such as wrongful death

24

and survival.

25

that.

And this case is a perfect illustration of

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, that really is a bit of a

2

stretch, isn't it, to say you're talking -- when you say

3

State law, you're only talking about wrongfully tendered

4

an act and that sort of thing?

5

MS. BRUECKNER:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

6

because section 4311(g)'s language is -- is quite clear

7

and it is set forth at the blue brief at page 6.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, to say it's quite clear -- it

does not relieve a person from liability at common law or

10

under State law.

11

meaning of that or you may suggest, I don't think you

12

could say it's clear.

13

Whatever we may come up with as the

MS. BRUECKNER:

I disagree, Your Honor, because

14

the reference to liability at common law or under State

15

law to my mind suggests a reference to liability under

16

State law, and liability under State law in this context

17

is liability by which the measure of damages is a State

18

statute, such as the wrongful death statute or the

19

survival statute here that this complaint arises under.

20

QUESTION:

21

of clear than I do.

I guess you have a different meaning

22

MS. BRUECKNER:

That -- that may be, Your Honor.

23

I would note, however, that in -- in Cipollone

24

this Court noted that language exactly like this, a

25

savings clause that specifically preserved liability at

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

common law or -- or under State law in the Comprehensive

2

Smokeless Tobacco Act, preserved common law claims.

3

is the same language.
QUESTION:

4

This

And again --

Why do you need that?

I mean, I'm --

5

I'm interested.

I might -- why do you need that if, in

6

fact, your interpretation of the preemption clause is

7

correct?

8

preempt positive common -- common law and positive law,

9

and some that don't.

There are some regs of the Coast Guard that do

And so the savings clause simply

10

makes clear that those that don't, don't.

11

meaning to it.
MS. BRUECKNER:

12
13

QUESTION:

So you don't need this damages thing,

do you?

16

MS. BRUECKNER:

17

QUESTION:

18

You're absolutely right, Your

Honor.

14
15

It gives

No, we don't, Your Honor.

Well, no, but the savings clause says

even those that do, don't.

19

(Laughter.)

20

QUESTION:

I mean, isn't that the --

21

QUESTION:

No, it doesn't necessarily have to --

22

the -- the -- I'm certain it's not clear to the contrary,

23

but it's at least arguably to the contrary.

24
25

MS. BRUECKNER:

Even without the savings clause,

we read section 4306 on its face as not encompassing

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

common law claims, and the main reason why, putting aside

2

the savings clause, is that the language of 4306 tracks

3

the language of section 4302 of the statute, which is the

4

affirmative delegation of rulemaking authority of the

5

Coast Guard.

6

the blue brief.

It's on the first page of the appendix to

And 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to do two

7
8

things:

9

associated equipment.

10

promulgate minimum safety standards and require

language that's in 4306.
QUESTION:

11
12

Well, this is the kind of thing that

the Coast Guard could require, isn't it?
MS. BRUECKNER:

13
14

And this is exactly the same

Propeller guard?

Absolutely, Your Honor, under

4302 -QUESTION:

15

And in Arkansas Electric, I think we

16

held that a Federal decision to forego regulation in a

17

given area may imply an authoritative Federal

18

determination that the area is best left unregulated and

19

would have as much preemptive force as a decision to

20

regulate.

21

Is that the situation here?

22

Guard looked at it and decided not to regulate.

23

apply Arkansas Electric and say that's binding?

24
25

MS. BRUECKNER:

Certainly the Coast
Should we

No, Your Honor, and here is why.

This case really presents the question, putting aside the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

express preemption issue which we believe is resolved by

2

Geier, of under what circumstances does an agency's

3

affirmative decision not to regulate pack a preemptive

4

punch such as -- so as to wipe out common law claims.

5

there are -- there are two preconditions that must be met,

6

neither of which is present here.

And

First, the agency's decision not to regulate

7
8

must take the form that itself possesses the force of law,

9

and that is lacking here for reasons I'll explain in a

10

moment.

11

Second, the agency --

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That was the holding of Arkansas

Electric; it doesn't have to take the form.
MS. BRUECKNER:

Actually the holding of Arkansas

15

Electric was that there was no preemption at all in that

16

case, but perhaps Your Honor is --

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but the -- the passage I read to

18

you indicates that a decision not to regulate can, in

19

fact, be -- have preemptive effect.

20

MS. BRUECKNER:

Yes, Your Honor, but a pure

21

decision not to regulate or a pure agency inaction has

22

only been held to exert preemptive effect in the context

23

of statutes that preempt the field where there's total

24

Federal occupation of the field.

25

Here, however you read 4306 with respect to

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State laws and regulations, common law claims we believe

2

are excluded from the regulated field.

3

has to be a conflict.

4

affirmative agency decision not to regulate to preempt

5

State law under a conflict preemption analysis, there both

6

has to be an agency action that possesses the force of law

7

and there has to be an actual conflict between the

8

agency's underlying reasons for not regulating and the

9

common law claims.

10
11

Therefore, there

And for affirmative -- an

And both of these criteria are absent

here.
First, as the United States has argued -- and we

12

agree -- this unpublished letter -- Coast Guard letter

13

itself lacks the force of law.

14

here that not only is there no agency regulation, but

15

there was never any rulemaking.

16

publication of a notice that the Coast Guard was even

17

considering --

18

QUESTION:

It's important to remember

There was never any

Let -- let me ask you this question.

19

Let's assume a -- a hypothetical case in which the engine

20

manufacturer is sued and is -- and is found liable by the

21

jury for having a propeller guard which makes the boat

22

difficult to turn so the boat hits the dock.

23

can't turn fast enough to avoid the dock.

24

case and it's consolidated with yours.

25

case where they're liable for having the guard and another

It -- it

We have that

So we have one

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case where they're liable for not having the -- the guard.

2

Would you argue the case the same way and would we have to

3

affirm both cases?

4

MS. BRUECKNER:

Yes, Your Honor, and -- and Your

5

Honor's hypothetical actually illustrates my point.

6

There's no question that a boat manufacturer could not be

7

held liable for installing -- could not be held -- a -- a

8

claim alleging that a boat manufacturer was negligent per

9

se for installing a propeller guard couldn't be based on

10

an existing Coast Guard regulation because the letter

11

lacks the force of law with respect to boat manufacturers.

12

There's no agency action here that could form the basis

13

for any common law claim one way or the other.

14

QUESTION:

But -- but if the manufacturer is

15

subject to conflicting jury verdicts, as you indicate -- I

16

suppose we could change the hypothetical so we have two

17

States, one which requires it, the other of which -- and

18

-- and you would say those weren't preempted, either.

19
20
21

MS. BRUECKNER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

-- and this is -QUESTION:

That seems to me to -- to give very

22

little effect to the wording of the clause which says that

23

a State cannot have a standard unless it's parallel to a

24

Federal statute.

25

MS. BRUECKNER:

But it does give meaning to the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

language of section 4311(g) which says that even where a

2

Coast Guard has promulgated a minimum safety standard,

3

common law liability is preserved except to the extent

4

that there's an actual conflict.
QUESTION:

5

But you could -- you could read that,

6

couldn't you -- you -- you argue that to accept your -- to

7

respondent's view would mean the savings clause has no

8

work to do, but the savings clause could still be for

9

cases of negligent -- negligent operation, for cases in --

10

of negligent -- negligence in manufacturing a piece of

11

equipment.

12

of this, there would be something saved.

13

I think you have to modify your argument.

14

clause would be nullified.

So there -- there would be -- on any reading

MS. BRUECKNER:

15

So -- so you -The savings

I respectfully disagree, Justice

16

Ginsburg, and -- and here's why.

17

contend that the savings clause applies to breach of

18

warranty and negligent manufacturing claims.

19

argument fails, first of all, because such claims are not

20

encompassed within 4306 on its face, and therefore there

21

wouldn't have been any need for Congress to save those

22

claims.

23

The respondent here does

And that

Secondly, this Court construed a similar savings

24

clause in Geier as expressing Congress's intent that mere

25

compliance with minimum safety standards would not be an

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

absolute defense to liability in a product liability

2

action.

3

establishing a minimum safety standard could never be an

4

absolute defense in a case involving negligent manufacture

5

or a breach of warranty, for example.

6

respondent's theory leaves really no meaningful role for

7

the savings clause to play.

So, the

And I would emphasize that these arguments were

8
9

And compliance with a Coast Guard regulation

all asked and answered in Geier, and the Court held that a

10

similarly worded savings clause, albeit without the

11

reference to State law, has to mean that common law claims

12

are not expressly preempted.
Now, that doesn't mean that our claims must

13
14

necessarily be permitted to go forward if they conflict

15

with Federal law, but there's clearly no conflict here

16

again for two reasons.
First, the Coast Guard letter lacks the force of

17
18

law.

And on that point, before turning to the reasons why

19

our claims are actually consistent with the Coast Guard's

20

stated reasons for declining to regulate, I would further

21

note that not only is there no regulation, no rulemaking

22

here, but the Coast Guard letter was never even published

23

in the Federal Register.

24

the public in any formal way whatsoever.

25

2

that the agency is going to continue to consider the

3

matter and gather further data.

4

itself lacks the force of law.

5

What the letter says is

And so, this letter

The second reason, of course, is that even if

the Coast Guard could preempt simply by writing a letter,

our claims are not inconsistent with the Coast Guard's

stated reasons for declining to regulate.

was focusing on the lack of a universally acceptable

11

such other matters, and there's no inconsistency between

13

QUESTION:

What if the Coast Guard's reason had

14

been we think putting the coast -- putting a propeller

15

guard on would make the -- the vessel even more dangerous?

16

MS. BRUECKNER:

There would still be no

17

preemption here because the Coast Guard letter lacks the

18

power to preempt.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Would that satisfy the second

condition of -- of your two-prong test?
MS. BRUECKNER:

It would, Your Honor, but our

22

position is that there still has to be a regulation and

23

there's no regulation here.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I understand. I'm just asking

you about the second part of your test.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

9

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The Coast Guard is the Federal agency charged

13

with administration of the Boat Safety Act and with the

14

promulgation of safety standards.
And to understand the Coast Guard's traditional

15
16

view of these issues and the backdrop against which

17

Congress legislated, it may be helpful to look to what the

18

Coast Guard said at the time the Boat Safety Act was

19

proposed.

20

brief, this is the answer provided by the Commandant of

21

the Coast Guard when he was asked, in written form,

22

whether it was his view that compliance with Federal

23

safety standards would furnish a complete defense to

24

liability under common law or State law.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

Go ahead.
For many years the Coast Guard has

required compliance with standards by inspected vessels.

10

Courts have consistently held that a vessel owner's

11

compliance with Coast Guard inspection requirements is not

12

synonymous with seaworthiness under maritime law.

13

the analogy is apparent, we would have no objection to an

14

express provision to clarify that a manufacturer's

15

compliance with promulgated standards does not by itself

16

relieve him of any tort liability which otherwise could

17

pertain.

18

And I think the --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEWART:

Though

Is he -- is the Commandant a lawyer?
I'm not sure whether the

21

Commandant was a lawyer, but the -- the questions were

submitted to him in written form.

25

QUESTION:

He was given time to

But the Commandant's lawyer or the

Commandant might well admit that if, as Justice Ginsburg

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pointed out, there's defective design, if -- if the

2

propeller falls apart and -- that then there's liability.

3

MR. STEWART:

4

QUESTION:

5

I think -- I think what --

So that -- this -- this thing that

you quote us just brings us right back to where we began.
MR. STEWART:

6

Well, I think a couple of things

7

are noteworthy about the way that the Commandant

8

responded.
First, when he gave -- first, he made clear that

9
10

the Coast Guard was familiar and was comfortable with the

11

idea that even when it had inspected a vessel and had --

12

the -- the vessel had passed the Coast Guard's own

13

regulatory standards, nevertheless there was a -- the

14

possibility of damages liability based on unseaworthiness.

15

QUESTION:

Would --

16

QUESTION:

What do we care whether the Coast

17

Guard was happy?

I mean, this isn't even plumbing the

18

mind of Congress.

It's plumbing the mind of the Coast

19

Guard.

20

What do we care?
MR. STEWART:

Well, I think part of the argument

21

on the other side has been that whatever the text of the

22

statute might say, the Court should strain to hold common

23

law claims --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, maybe.

That may -- but what I

don't see here is whether he's aware of the fact which is

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and I'm aware of it and you are -- that whatever

2

standard the Coast Guard has -- let's say you have to have

3

a 1-inch wire, and what my -- they mean by that is you

4

don't have to a 2-inch wire.

5

And there is no point in telling the State of Idaho you

6

can't pass a law for a 2-inch wire when any jury in the

7

State of Idaho can come in with a judgment that does

8

precisely the same thing as that rule.

9

Coast Guard Commandant doesn't care about whether it can

10

preempt at all, but it doesn't seem to me logical to take

11

the position you can't have a regulation but you can have

12

a tort judgment that is identical.

13

MR. STEWART:

Okay?

Absolutely clear.

I mean, maybe this

Well, first of all, the tort

14

judgment is not identical because it fulfills an important

15

purpose that the prescriptive standard doesn't, namely

16

compensating people who have actually been injured by

17

reason of defects.

18

QUESTION:

You could say we don't care if, in

19

fact, the rules that we're about to promulgate are totally

20

ignored by the States, as long as the purpose is to

21

compensate someone.

22

MR. STEWART:

Well, as this Court made clear in

23

Geier, the effect of holding that State common law suits

24

are not categorically preempted is not that the Federal

25

judgments can be ignored; that is, there's still a role

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for principles of conflict preemption.

2

said the point of the savings clause would be eviscerated

3

if common law claims were -- that were not identical to

4

Federal standards were categorically preempted.

5

Nevertheless, particular common law claims can conflict

6

with the -- the text or purposes of particular

regulations.

The Court in Geier

The Commandant didn't seem to

In -- in your endorsement of the

10

Commandant's statement, I thought you were disagreeing

11

with -- with counsel for the petitioners here who -- who

12

did say that there could be conflict preemption of common

13

law claims, anyway.

14

recognize that.

15

The Commandant doesn't even seem to

MR. STEWART:

I think what he is saying is we

16

have always understood that compliance with our regulatory

17

requirements will not furnish a categorical defense to

18

suits at common law and we would understand the same --

19

QUESTION:

Well -- well, maybe it ought to be

20

interpreted, to try to make sense of this scheme, as

21

certainly covering the situation where the State by its

22

common law doctrine tries to make a requirement that the

23

Coast Guard has -- and the Federal Government has flatly

24

contradicted by regulation.

25

but if the Coast Guard were to pass a regulation saying no

That may not be this case,

1

propeller guards should be put on boats because we think

2

it is more dangerous, if they have them, now we should

3

interpret the savings clause as not allowing a cause of

4

action on that same ground.
MR. STEWART:

5

That's exactly right and that's

6

precisely the analysis that the Court went through in

7

Geier and it's the analysis we urge the -QUESTION:

8
9

But -- but under your -- your

rationale, you say, oh, but there's a duty to compensate,

10

and that's different.

11

apply so that you tell Justice O'Connor, oh, yes, the jury

12

can -- can go full speed ahead?
MR. STEWART:

13

Why doesn't that same argument

I mean, I think the Court has

14

often pointed out in various contexts that even where it

15

can be said that a primary goal of Congress was X, we

16

shouldn't assume that Congress intended to pursue that

17

goal at all costs.

18

a somewhat different balance with respect to common law

19

actions than it did with -- with respect to prescriptive

20

rules.

21

The point is simply that Congress drew

And I think part of the reason for that was that

22

Congress was establishing a mechanism by which the Coast

23

Guard could itself promulgate prescriptive safety

24

standards.

law with something else.

In ousting State law, it was replacing State
But the Boat Safety Act doesn't

1

contain any mechanism by which an injured person can seek

2

compensation for his injuries, and therefore it was

3

natural for Congress to determine that subject to conflict

4

preemption principles, the remedial mechanisms that had

5

previously been available should continue to be available.

6

And I think -QUESTION:

7

Well, maybe -- maybe it doesn't do

8

that much.

of action for breach of warranty, for negligent operation

10

I mean, maybe the savings clause allows causes

of the boat, and things like that.
MR. STEWART:

11

I -- well, the -- the same could

12

have been said of the savings clause in Geier, but the

13

Court, nevertheless, concluded that common law actions

14

were not categorically preempted.

15

as Ms. Brueckner said, was that no one could have supposed

16

that common law claims going to an entirely different

17

aspect of the manufacturer's conduct than the divine,

Guard's regulatory -QUESTION:

20

And I think the reason,

I -- I don't see how you -- you talk

21

about straining.

All -- there is some -- number of

22

statutes.

23

isn't really that much substantive difference between

24

them.

to take the view, treat statutes and common law alike, and

They all read a little differently, but there

probably they're not preempted either unless the agency

2

comes in and makes it pretty clear that they are.

3

that's pretty easy for people to follow.

argue pro and con preemption, they go to the agency.

5

MR. STEWART:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

Now,

If they want to

I think that may --

So wouldn't I reach that same

position here?
MR. STEWART:

That -- that might be a legitimate

rule to follow in the absence of statutory language

10

expressly addressing the subject, but here we have one

11

provision that says a State may not establish a law

12

requirement of setting forth a safety standard or

13

requirement for associated equipment unless it is

14

identical to a Federal safety standard.

15

And then in the savings clause it says -- and

16

this is at page App. 6 of the blue brief -- compliance

17

with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders

18

prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person

19

from liability at common law under State law.

20

that means, it has to mean there will be some

21

circumstances under which the manufacturer complies with

22

all applicable Federal rules and yet is nevertheless held

23

liable under the common law.

24
25

QUESTION:

So whatever

And --

Very simple.

In those situations

where you -- as you just heard, the ones that the

24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

petitioner just argued for.

2

QUESTION:

Design defect.

3

MR. STEWART:

But -- but if -- if the same rule

4

of preemption were applied to common law suits as to

5

prescriptive regulations, namely that the State couldn't

6

do anything that was not identical to Federal law, it

7

could never be the case that a manufacturer who complied

8

with Federal law could, nevertheless, be held liable at

9

common law.

The -- the preemption clause and the savings

10

clause, read together, compel the conclusion that Congress

11

at least intended a different rule of preemption to apply.
QUESTION:

12

That's -- that's not -- that's not

13

true.

14

propeller should be manufactured, out of a -- an eighth of

15

an inch or -- or of a tenth of an inch blade.

The Coast Guard doesn't say how the -- the

And if the

But I -- I don't think anyone

18

would have contended that such a suit would be preempted

19

by the preemption clause even in the absence of the

20

savings clause.

21

And again, this is exactly the same situation

22

that was before the Court in Geier.

Had -- had that

23

argument been a sound one, the Court would presumably have

24

construed the -- the Motor Vehicle Safety Act savings

clause that was at issue there --

distinguish State -- not just State common law, but State

exclude State statutes as well as the common law.
MR. STEWART:

10

You have to draw some line that is going to

Well, it does refer to -- may I

finish?

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MR. STEWART:

It refers to liability under -- at

13

common law or under State law, and therefore State law is

14

most naturally taken to be a reference to laws that

15

accomplish purposes similar to those of the common law.

Mr. Shapiro, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I think a word of history here explains some of

23

the mystery surrounding the statutory language.

For over

24

90 years, Congress has specified the safety equipment that

25

has to be installed on motorboats, and it was in 1937 that

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court ruled in Kelly v. Washington that the States

2

may not impose their own requirements for safety equipment

3

on boats that travel in interstate waters.

4

the background of this legislation.

5

And that was

This act preempts State law creating any

6

requirement for boat equipment that is not identical with

7

the prescribed Coast Guard regulation.

8

critical fail-safe purpose.

9

guards may not be imposed on the public under State law

And this serves a

Risky devices like propeller

10

unless and until they're approved by the expert regulatory

11

agency under the criteria that Congress has laid down.

12

Now, this preemption provision has three

13

exceptions which are written right into the provision, but

14

none of those exceptions fits this case.

15

have to make the argument that this general savings

16

clause, which says nothing about preemption, is another

17

implicit exception, but that's inconsistent --

18
19

QUESTION:

So my friends

Unless there's just no Federal

regulation at all on this.

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

21

QUESTION:

And -- and --

Maybe the Federal Government has not

22

-- acting through the Coast Guard, has made no

23

requirement, no decision at all.

24

MR. SHAPIRO:

25

And the -- the wisdom of this

statute is that until the Coast Guard makes a decision

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about a device like propeller guards, they may not be

2

imposed on the public.
Think of what happens under Justice Kennedy's

3
4

example.

5

devices and backs up that judgment with millions of

6

dollars in damages, people in 49 other States are exposed

7

to the risks and burdens of propeller guards.

If Illinois commands installation of these

word.

The common law never imposes a requirement.

MR. SHAPIRO:

17

This

There's no State

Well, we agree with the statement

18

in Garmon that the Court, for preemption purposes, should

19

assume compliance and then ask what are the implications.

20

The implications are that Illinois could coerce the

21

installation of these devices.

22

disagree.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I don't see how you get from one jury verdict, that that

2

becomes the positive law of the State, that you must have

3

a propeller guard.
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

Well, after the first jury

5

verdict, then the -- in come the claims for punitive

6

damages in the next case, and there is a powerful coercive

7

effect from damage actions.
QUESTION:

8
9

This Court has said so.

Mr. Shapiro, isn't it true that there

all -- aren't there -- isn't it true there are all sorts

10

of cases in which different designs of boats may have a --

11

be more dangerous than other designs, depending on whether

12

they have a propeller guard?
I notice that one of the allegations in the

13
14

prayer for relief in the complaint was they provided an

15

unreasonably dangerous design in utilizing an unprotected

16

propeller.

17

necessarily mean every boat needed a -- a propeller guard,

18

but rather some particularly dangerous designs might need

19

one.

That -- as I read that, that wouldn't

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

said we're still keeping this under advisement.

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

They

And in April of 2001, they looked

19

at this again, and the Coast Guard representative on the

20

safety council said we realize we cannot mandate

21

installation of propeller guards.

and the propeller guard subcommittee said again, these

23

will increase blunt trauma injuries.

24
25

QUESTION:

They're not feasible,

This is something that's published,

that's -- that's a formal kind of action?

13

don't know that their -- their announcement has any

14

particular status that's relevant here.

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, because of the wording of

16

this statute, which is so different from Geier -- it's the

17

exact opposite of Geier -- under this statute, unless

18

there's an identical Coast Guard regulation in place,

19

State law is preempted.

20

QUESTION:

I don't see how it is so different

21

from Geier.

22

regulation at all, no requirements, then the State

23

couldn't have any tort law?

24
25

I mean, you read it as saying if there's no

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, as to equipment, associated

equipment, for boats, unless there's a Coast Guard

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regulation in place, the States can't mandate that

2

equipment.

3

QUESTION:

All right.

Then you would say, for

4

example -- not just that, but in your view if you had,

5

like a propeller that shot torpedoes, I mean, something

6

that was absolutely absurd, you -- the State would not be

7

able to have a tort judgment based on that even though the

8

Coast Guard has never had the chance to look into it?

9
10
11
12

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well --

Now, I mean, I grant you that's a

possible reading.
But I think perhaps a better reading of it would

13

be that you can't have a -- a rule or a regulation or a

14

tort judgment or any other requirement of law different

15

from a Coast Guard requirement when there is a

16

requirement.

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor --

But not when there isn't.
Your Honor, we -- we think that

20

overlooks the history that I began with because under this

21

22

requirements for equipment or -- or construction, design

23

or structure for boats moving in interstate waters.

24

was Kelly v. Washington, a unanimous opinion by Chief

25

Justice Hughes.

2

setting, the Coast Guard said, when this Boat Safety Act

3

was new, States, until we get around to doing this, your

5

State law regulating equipment that was there for the

6

Coast Guard to say, it will take us time to get our

regulations.

8

there must have been some law to apply in the States.

9

So there must have been some scope for

In the meantime, State law applies.

MR. SHAPIRO:

So

Oh, yes, there -- there are three

10

exceptions to the preemption provision.

11

exceptions, and we don't have to go looking to the savings

12

clause for a fourth, implied exception.

13

They're explicit

There -- there is an exception if the Coast

14

didn't do that here.

There's another exemption for local hazardous

conditions, but that exception doesn't fit here either.

But I'm talking about in the interim.

It's from -- what was it -- '71 to '73?

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The rules that applied were State

22

rules because the Coast Guard said, States, your law

23

controls while we haven't got any yet.

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's the key point, Your Honor.

That was done by formal exemption, and that shows that

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this statute has the exceptions built right into

preemption provision.

QUESTION:

But it shows that there must have

4

been State law.

it's been forever or for a very long time that only

Federal law sets the standards.

7

Yes.

The Coast Guard must have thought

there were standards in existence that could be applied.

What -- what was happening,

11

according to the legislative history, is the States were

12

beginning to require battery covers, anchors, lines, and

13

other pieces of associated equipment, including warning

14

decals on the boats, and Congress says, this has to stop.

15

There's nothing wrong with these requirements, but we

16

can't have 50 sets of them.

17

preempted for associated equipment requirements until the

18

Coast Guard adopts a regulation or the Coast Guard gives

19

an exemption, which it did in 1971.

20

So this field is being

And I think the structure is very important.

21

This is so different from Geier.

There was not a

22

structure like this with three exceptions written right

23

into the statute, and to treat the savings clause, which

24

doesn't say a word about preemption and which the

25

legislative history says is simply a matter of State law

defenses, as a fourth, implied exception to preemption

2

truly does violence to the structure of this law.

3

QUESTION:

Well, what do you --

4

QUESTION:

How do you treat the savings clause?

5

What -- what do you think it means?
MR. SHAPIRO:

6

It does not address preemption at

7

all.

8

could be available under State law.

9

compliance with Coast Guard regulations or orders or any

10

It addresses an affirmative defense that it -- that
That's the defense of

provision of this entire statute.

11

Now, section 288C of the Restatement of Torts --

12

this is an echo of section 288C which was published just a

13

few years before Congress passed the savings provision.

14

It doesn't deal with preemption at all.

15

with compliance.
QUESTION:

16

Right.

It deals with --

To make this clear, would you

17

identify the kinds of cases that you envision at State law

18

that this clause, in effect, says you may not defend

19

conclusively by claiming compliance with a Coast Guard

20

reg?

21

What kinds of cases?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It has a huge scope of operation,

22

unlike Geier.

To start with the Coast Guard's example,

23

the ordinary negligence case, negligent operation was very

24

important to Congress because most of these propeller

25

accidents occur because of negligent operation or reckless

operation of the boat.

That's what the Coast Guard says

2

on its web site today.

And so the defendant couldn't

3

defend by saying, gee, my boat complies with all the Coast

4

Guard regulations -QUESTION:

5

Okay.

No, no, I understand your

6

point.

7

what else do you have in mind?

8
9

But you've got negligent operation and what --

MR. SHAPIRO:

The -- the next thing the Coast

Guard referred to is express warranty.

The defendant

10

couldn't say simply because I've complied with this long

11

list of Coast Guard requirements, I don't have to honor my

12

contractual promises or --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Okay.

How about negligent

manufacture?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Negligent installation is

16

certainly covered, and defective manufacture is also

17

protected by the savings clause.

18

unit comes off the assembly line and it's defective.

19

Those were the original tort cases --

20

QUESTION:

That's when a particular

I -- I suppose there would be some

21

close cases.

Suppose there's two ways to make a

22

propeller.

23

teflon cover and -- and a gear mechanism that makes it

24

stop the minute it hits a hard object.

25

cheaper way, to make it terribly sharp and no -- no

One is to have it slightly canted with a

The other is the

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

ability to stop.

Could the injured party sue the

2

manufacturer of the second kind, the -- the cheap,

3

dangerous kind of propeller?
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

It is possible and for this

5

reason.

The language of the statute for associated

6

equipment only preempts requirements for associated

7

equipment.

8

requirements to install propeller guards, which you've not

9

installed.

And that could be construed to mean simply

10

Now, if you took a different interpretation of

11

requirements for, it might encompass that case, but this

12

Court could give a narrow construction to requirements

13

for.
And this case is the paradigm case because

14
15

manufacturers have decided not to use this kind of safety

16

equipment because they know it's a hazard.

17

hazard.

18

21 safety experts of the Coast Guard have pointed out the

19

dangers this creates.

20

--

21

It's a known

Several courts have disapproved these devices.

QUESTION:

So manufacturers have consciously

Mr. Shapiro, I'm not sure you

22

answered my question before.

Again, supposing 90 percent

23

of the boats really don't need a propeller guard, using

24

the reasoning of the committee that decided not to

25

recommend.

But there are 10 percent that are some exotic

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

design that's particularly dangerous and they really are

2

dangerous unless they have a -- a propeller guard on them.

3

Could you say that -- that 10 percent has to be treated

4

like the 90 percent?

5
6
7

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, because the manufacturer

doesn't know -QUESTION:

Well, it's the design.

I'm just

talking about a particular design -MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- that seems to be particularly

11

hazardous if you had the propeller too close to the person

12

operating the boat or something like that.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the reason that's preempted

14

and that that is a requirement for associated equipment,

15

even in the case that you give, is because the

16

manufacturer has no idea what hull is going to be put

17

together with this motor.

18

hull to hull.

19

The motor can move from hull to

And what the Coast Guard found -- the -- the

20

committee found in its report was that you have to have an

21

exact hydrodynamic fit between the particular engine and

22

the particular hull and the particular propeller guard.

23

So if juries, say, impose propeller guards on -- on

24

designs we think are dangerous --

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but what if the manufacturer of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the propeller is on notice that it's being -- was being

2

purchased for a particularly dangerous design, as I've

3

described?

4

could know what kind of boats it's going on.

It seems to me sometimes the -- the company

MR. SHAPIRO:

5

Well, we -- we rely on the logic

6

of this committee report which says that -- that for all

7

planing boats that go 10 miles an hour or faster, these

8

devices are counterproductive because they interfere with

9

steering.

They double the amount of fuel that's consumed.

10

They increase air and water pollution and they create

11

serious hazards of blunt trauma injury.

12

So what the -- the committee found was that

13

these devices for any category of planing boat -- and here

14

we have a boat that goes 50 miles an hour.

15

18-foot ski boat with a 115 horsepower engine.

16

QUESTION:

We've got an

But you could -- it seems to me as a

17

matter of defense to tort liability, you could put all

18

that evidence in, and say in this particular case, our

19

design was sensible for the very reasons you just

20

described.

21

Therefore, we're not negligent.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that's true in many of these

22

preemption cases, but all it takes is an errant jury

23

verdict or two or three to coerce a decision by the

24

manufacturer to install devices that are very hazardous to

25

the public.

39

QUESTION:

Then all you'd have to do is go to

2

the Coast Guard and say, look what's happened, and then

3

they'd be explicit, if you're right.

4

there would have a chance to argue to the Coast Guard that

5

you're not right.
MR. SHAPIRO:

6

And the other side

Justice Breyer, that's cold

7

comfort.

8

submitted saying that it's up to the jury to decide

9

whatever the jury wants.

10

They would hand us this brief that they've just

QUESTION:

Well, fine.

If that's the policy of

11

the Coast Guard, then I don't see why you should rely upon

12

them for preemption.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, because Congress had a

14

different vision.

15

Kelly, Kelly against Washington.

16

Congress was going with the rule of

Well, why did Congress then say

17

minimum standards?

It didn't say the Coast Guard

18

standards are necessarily adequate.

19

Guard, set minimum standards.

It just said, Coast

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the legislative history is

21

very explicit on that.

The boating associations and the

22

manufacturers associations had all kinds of very elaborate

23

standards of their own, and everybody said during these

24

hearings that is to be encouraged.

25

more of that.

We want them to do

The statute shouldn't stop that.

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But there was no suggestion that the States could

2

intervene and impose their own standards and their own

3

requirements.

4

Court said minimum standards under another similar statute

5

do not mean -- do not mean that the States can embroider

6

on and supplement those -- those standards.

And in fact, in the Ray decision, this

And after all, the preemption provision here

7
8

doesn't say anything about minimum standards or maximum

standards.

It says all requirements for boat safety

equipment are preempted unless there is an identical Coast

11

Guard regulation in place.

And I'd like to suggest to the Court that it

makes a huge difference here that this is a case that

arises in the maritime context.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

understood those.

2

But this is maritime context, and this lake --

3

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held

4

that is -- it's a navigable interstate body of water.
QUESTION:

5

Yes, because it -- it happens to lie

6

on the border between two States, but not every landlocked

7

lake is subject to -- to Coast Guard maritime

8

jurisdiction.
MR. SHAPIRO:

9
10

Oh, absolutely not.

It has to be

an interstate body of water.
But since the 1850s, this Court has held that

11
12

interstate waterways are subject to the maritime

13

jurisdiction.
And this waterway, by the way, was constructed

15

by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

17

business, the pleasure boating business, on Dale Hollow

18

19

It's surrounded with

And because this is a maritime context, that

20

says a lot about the savings clause, because this Court

21

has held that in maritime cases, savings clauses should be

22

interpreted narrowly to avoid obstructing the carefully

23

constructed preemption provision in the statute and to

24

avoid making an end run around the Coast Guard's expert

25

supervision, which is what Congress wanted.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And we go further and say that because the court

2

below was right in characterizing this as an admiralty

3

case, any conflict between Illinois law and Federal law is

4

just imaginary.

5

Federal maritime jurisdiction, and there can't be --

That's because Federal common law follows

QUESTION:

6

But you didn't argue that.

I mean,

7

in Illinois -- all through the Illinois State courts, the

8

assumption was that the -- the law to be applied, if you

9

could have a common law, would be Illinois common law, not

10

some Federal maritime common law.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the Illinois Supreme Court

12

agreed with us on this point.

13

their opinion -QUESTION:

14

They have two pages in

They -- all they said is that the --

15

the preemptive force is different.

They did not say that

16

Illinois common law was displaced.

That is, if there is

17

State law to -- if there is law other than the Coast Guard

18

regulations to apply, it was Illinois State law all -- all

19

along.

20

that you raised the question, never mind State law, the

21

Federal maritime law would control in any event.

And as far as I know, it wasn't until this Court

MR. SHAPIRO:

22

Well, we think this is an included

23

question.

It was certainly addressed by the court below.

24

The court below cited this Court's Jensen decision, which

25

is the leading maritime preemption decision.

And it was

using maritime analysis to support the preemption holding

2

that the court ultimately made.

3

one in our preemption argument below, but we're entitled

4

to elaborate it in this Court and cite additional cases.
QUESTION:

5

Now, this was step number

Well, why was the argument that

6

Illinois law is preempted, why was that at issue at all

if, as you say, there is no State law in this area?

all Federal.
MR. SHAPIRO:

9

It's

Well, we -- we proceeded to argue

10

in the alternative that under express preemption and under

11

a conflict preemption that -- that State law was

12

preempted.

13

on maritime, I think it is an addressed and included

14

question.

But with a two-page discussion in this opinion

And if the Court doesn't consider -QUESTION:

15

Did you -- in your -- in the briefing

16

of this case in the State court, did you make the argument

17

Federal law covers the waterfront?

18

to apply?.
MR. SHAPIRO:

19

There is no State law

We made the first part of the

20

argument.

We said Federal law covers the waterfront

21

because Congress conceived of this as a maritime question

22

and was preempting State law broadly, exerting its

23

traditional, under Kelly against Washington, the usual

24

Federal Government role over equipment installed on

25

motorboats.

And we said that this is an enclave of

3

cases and we said it was an admiralty case.
QUESTION:

5

And we cited this Court's Yamaha decision
We cited admiralty

But Yamaha said that this is an open

question, and it didn't resolve it.
MR. SHAPIRO:

6

Right, but our -- my point is that

7

we were citing this Court's admiralty decisions.

And then

8

the Illinois Supreme Court went further and cited a host

9

of additional admiralty decisions.

Now, when you have

10

that kind of discussion in a State court opinion of a

11

Federal law issue, this Court, I believe, can reach that

12

as an included question and it's an intertwined question.
And let me suggest it is the easiest way to

resolve and the narrowest way to resolve this case because

where it was, you'd have a different result or you might

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

in damages, that would impose these devices on all the

these are risky devices with serious problems.

don't know why the Illinois State legislature couldn't say

MR. SHAPIRO:

13

But that is

And I think that is a true disservice to

14

federalism, to have these kinds of conflicting judgments,

15

and it shows the wisdom of Congress's architecture in this

16

statute, that the States may not impose requirements for

17

propeller guards unless and until the Coast Guard vets

18

these proposals, finds that they're safe, finds that they

19

satisfy Federal criteria of feasibility and safety, and

20

adopts the rule and a regulation.

It's like FDA legislation, protect the public

against common law claims of this sort that could have

They might not say that, of

But suppose they do just refuse to

have any requirement.

I mean, that's equally absurd to

me.

On the one hand, you point to one absurdity one way,

11

but it seems equally absurd to have no law in the area

12

where the Coast Guard just refuses to act.
MR. SHAPIRO:

13

The -- there's a good reason for

14

refusing to act in this instance, and that is, these

15

devices are very hazardous.

16

safely.

17

worse than the propeller slices.

18

propeller slices occasionally, but the blunt trauma injury

19

from a propeller guard is lethal if it hits you in the

20

There's a

Now, these devices clearly raise policy concerns

of nationwide significance and that's why the Coast Guard

24

had to consider these issues in proceedings around the

25

country that lasted for 18 months.

But Congress did

pursue its safety agenda through a particular method, and

that was uniform standards for marine equipment.

wanted the whole Nation to benefit from safe and efficient

standards, and it wanted the whole Nation to be protected

against standards and requirements that represent risky

experiments.

standards have to meet stringent Federal criteria before

And that's just what propeller guards are.

And that does bring us back to congressional

intent because when Congress passed this preemption

that the savings clause must be read simply to preserve

which is itself broad, but the legislative history of the

Well, first

11

of all, the Coast Guard letter doesn't say anything about

12

the hazards of propeller guards.
And contrary to Mr. Shapiro's contention, in

13
14

April 2001, the Coast Guard's advisory committee issued --

15

stated in its minutes a recommendation that the Coast

16

Guard actually require propeller guards as one of four

17

permitted options on boats exactly like this one.

-- the cite is on page 11, footnote 14 of the yellow

brief.

This is

On the conflicting judgments point, Mr. Shapiro

22
23

raises the specter of conflicting jury verdicts in these

24

cases and Congress cannot possibly have intended that

25

result.

And even where

But if -- and indeed there are conflicting jury

verdicts that arise, the Coast Guard can step into the

8

breach, and as Justice Ginsburg suggested, State

9

legislatures could pass a rule saying that no liability

could be imposed in cases like this one.
