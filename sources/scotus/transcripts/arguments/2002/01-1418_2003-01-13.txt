versus Arlene L. Warner.

Mr. Goldblatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDBLATT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
An individual debtor at the end of a bankruptcy

11
12

case will typically receive a discharge of that debtor's

13

pre-bankruptcy debts.

14

to a number of statutory exceptions, each exception

15

reflecting a congressional judgment that a particular

16

category of debt be paid notwithstanding the prior

17

bankruptcy.

18

money obtained by fraud, debts for injuries caused by

19

drunk driving, and amounts due for alimony and child

20

support.

That discharge, however, is subject

Those exceptions include not only debts for

With respect to the fraud exception at issue

21
22

here, under the Bankruptcy Code and this Court's cases, a

23

debt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if the creditor can

24

establish that the underlying debt arises out of an act of

25

fraud.

The question presented in this case is whether a

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

debt that would otherwise be nondischargeable for that

2

reason becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a

3

settlement agreement that resolves the amount of the debt.

4

The court of appeals said that a settlement did

5

have that effect, emphasizing that the effect of a

6

settlement was to trade a fraud claim for a contract

7

action that would be discharged in bankruptcy.

8
9

QUESTION:

Is it your understanding that if the

Fourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in

10

this case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing

11

rule in all of the States, or would certain States differ

12

on whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when

13

there was a settlement agreement?

14

State-by-State?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Would we have to go

No, Your Honor.

The question of

16

dischargeability is a question of Federal law.

17

how each of the courts of appeals that have addressed the

18

question has treated it.

19

versus Garner, has emphasized that the construction of

20

section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is a question of

21

Federal law.

22

QUESTION:

That is

Indeed, this Court, in Grogan

Well, my -- my question, perhaps, was

23

not as clear as it ought to have been.

The Fourth Circuit

24

placed substantial reliance on the fact that this was a

25

novation under State law, that there was a new debt

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

created superseding the old, et cetera, and my question is

2

whether or not -- if we affirm its judgment, that we will

3

find in almost every other State a settlement is also a

4

novation, or will the rule vary from State to State, and

5

if it does vary from State to State, will the Fourth

6

Circuit rule from this particular State be the majority

7

rule or minority?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

8
9

Your Honor, the court of appeals

did, indeed, say that the -- the settlement effected a

10

novation.

That is a common rule.

11

jurisdiction in which that -- that wouldn't be the

12

principle.

13

is the effect as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law of

14

that settlement.

The question, nevertheless, before this Court

QUESTION:

15

I'm unaware of any

I'm -- I'm well aware of that, but

16

what I'm just asking is -- this case came from South

17

Carolina, was it?

18

MR. GOLDBLATT:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GOLDBLATT:

21

QUESTION:

From North Carolina, Your Honor.

Oh, from North Carolina.
Yes.

Is the North Carolina rule about

22

novations and settlements the majority rule for most of

23

the States?

24

novation?

25

In most States, would this be called a

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm unaware of

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any jurisdiction in which a settlement doesn't effect

2

novation.

3

dispute, it is commonly the case that -- indeed, in every

4

jurisdiction of which I'm aware, following that

5

settlement, the -- the creditor or the plaintiff is unable

6

to bring a new lawsuit for fraud.

7

left to enforce the -- the settlement.
QUESTION:

9

When the parties to a dispute settle that

Mr. Goldblatt, I take it you're

saying, yeah, a novation is fine with you.

$200,000 and a promissory note for $100,000.

21

this case perhaps you can clarify for me.

22

Leonard Warner stipulated that this was a nondischargeable

23

debt, but his wife, who's in the bankruptcy with him, says

24

yes, it is dischargeable.

25

stipulation by Leonard Warner that this debt is

It's odd that

What is the effect of the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

nondischargeable?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

2

Your Honor, Leonard Warner

3

stipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him.

4

With respect to Mrs. Warner, it would remain our burden in

5

bankruptcy to show that -- that there is an act of fraud

6

that is properly attributable to her, either because she

7

committed it herself or by some principle of agency that

8

it is nondischargeable because of her, so I -- I don't

9

believe that the -- the stipulation by its terms is -- is

10

dispositive on the question of whether it is

11

nondischargeable as -- as to her.
QUESTION:

12

But does that mean that -- let's say

13

the Fourth Circuit is affirmed, that you could still,

14

post-bankruptcy, go after Mr. Warner because he stipulated

15

that the debt as to him was nondischargeable?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

16

I -- I believe that -- that's a

17

final and unappealable order at this point, and yes,

18

that's right, of course.

19

have the right as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law also

20

to continue to recover on this debt as against

21

Mrs. Warner, who also is an obligor on the promissory

22

note.

23

Petitioners assert that they

On the essential point that, Justice Ginsburg,

24

you were making with respect to the holding below, the

25

description you offered is -- is exactly right.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It is

1

true that there is a novation.

2

underlying claim of fraud has been released, but just --

3

that was equally true in this Court's decision in Brown

4

versus Felsen.

5

It is true that the

In Brown, the parties to a State court

6

litigation resolved that litigation by agreeing to the

7

entry of a consent judgment.

8

there, as it is here, that the parties who had been --

9

whose litigation had ended in the consent judgment were

It was as equally true

10

barred, in that case by the preclusive effect of the

11

consent judgment, here by the binding effect of the

12

settlement, from bringing a new suit claiming fraud.

13

they could do was enforce the consent judgment.

All

14

Nevertheless, this Court held in a unanimous

15

opinion in Brown versus Felsen that in bankruptcy, the

16

creditor nevertheless had the right to seek to establish

17

that the underlying debt arises out of an act of fraud,

18

and the -- the reason this Court --

QUESTION:

Well, of course, there it wasn't just

20

the underlying debt.

go beyond the terms of the judgment to determine what the

23

judgment actually resolved.

25

It was trying to find out what the

MR. GOLDBLATT:

They were -- they were able to

I'm not quite sure it's

Well, yes, Justice Stevens,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's right, and here what -- what petitioners seek to do

2

is go behind the settlement agreement --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GOLDBLATT:

5

Yes.
-- and see what the settlement

actually resolved.
QUESTION:

6

Supposing the settlement -- they had

7

gone along with the settlement, and then they came up with

8

a -- a third proposal where the debtor said, I'm not sure

9

I'm going to be able to meet my obligations, but I've got

10

another proposal, we'll go in the joint venture to do

11

something else and we'll release the contract claim and

12

substitute a third, could you go -- still continue to go

13

behind to find out what the original source of the debt

14

was?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

So even if, say, they had five or six

17

different transactions, each of which purported to be a

18

complete substitute for the deal they had just been unable

19

to -- you can always go -- say, Well, the whole thing

20

started because you cheated me out of something?

21

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well -- well, for each

22

particular debt that one asserts is nondischargeable, the

23

creditor bears the burden of proving in bankruptcy that

24

that debt arises out of an act of fraud.

Directly or indirectly out of.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's right, but nevertheless,

under Brown versus Felsen, that is the creditor's -QUESTION:

Suppose I have an indebtedness.

I'm

4

running a business and I have one indebtedness, and in

5

order to cover the payments for that indebtedness, I incur

6

a second indebtedness which I otherwise would not have

7

incurred, is that traceable to fraud?

11

MR. GOLDBLATT:

If the original indebtedness

arises out of an act of fraud, Justice Scalia, then -then yes, it is all debt -QUESTION:

Anything that happens later is --

12

that -- that wouldn't have happened but for the original

13

indebtedness is, within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act,

14

traceable to the fraud?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Scalia, we -- we

16

certainly acknowledge that there must be some principle

17

of, say, proximate causation.

18

QUESTION:

Exactly, and that's all we're talking

19

about here, isn't -- isn't it?

20

how far down the line do we carry traceable to, and does a

21

novation end the traceability, but you -- you have to

22

acknowledge it has to end somewhere.

23

MR. GOLDBLATT:

How -- how -- you know,

There certainly is a principle

24

of proximate causation.

You -- you need to show that

25

there is a direct connection between the act of fraud --

QUESTION:

Wait, but what about -- I mean, this

2

doesn't make too much sense to me.

3

$100,000 because of a fraud that A committed against B, so

4

they settle it, and they say, our settlement arrangement

is the following.

6

Macy's Department Store, and many years later there's

7

another debt between the partners arising out of buying

8

furniture for Macy's that has nothing to do with fraud,

9

and now you're saying that that debt's going to be never

10

dischargeable because the cause of Macy's was the fraud?

We enter into a new business called

MR. GOLDBLATT:

11

You say, A owes B

No, Justice Breyer, I'm not

12

suggesting that there is never a point in which the

13

causation becomes too tenuous that you can't prove that

14

the debt that one is contending is -QUESTION:

15

No, I -- absolutely.

Macy's would

16

never have been created but for the debt, no doubt about

17

that.

QUESTION:

Well, you're talking not just about

cause, but about proximate cause.

Exactly.

It's not just a

question of but-for causation, but as in common law,

What's the difference between this case and

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Your Honor, here, all that

6

happened is that the -- the form of the debt changed.

parties entered into a settlement agreement in which they

8

changed the debt from an unliquidated cause of action for

9

fraud into a liquidated promissory note.

side said to the other, I don't care whether this has come

out of fraud or not.

14

quits.

15

because the averment of both parties is, never mind fraud,

settle this.

Whether there was fraud or whether there

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That -- that's right, Your

20

Honor, and all a creditor seeks to do in showing a debt as

21

nondischargeable is seeks to enforce the debtor's promise

22

to pay the amount of money given in that settlement.

QUESTION:

That's true, but -- but here it

was -- there was no acknowledgement of the fraud.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It was

This debt is just to settle this controversy

between us whether there was fraud or whether there wasn't

fraud.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

QUESTION:

That's --

Why isn't that enough to terminate

6

the proximity necessary for -- for nondischargeability in

7

bankruptcy?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

8
9

Just a couple of -- of answers.

First, it -- it doesn't terminate the proximity any more

10

than the consent judgment in Brown versus Felsen might

11

have terminated the proximity in that case.

12

course, true that a -- a consent judgment operates as a --

13

extinguishes the prior cause of action and the claims

14

merge into the consent judgment.

It's, of

Nevertheless, this Court said in Brown versus

15
16

Felsen that notwithstanding the preclusive effect of that

17

judgment, a creditor has the right in bankruptcy to

18

establish that the debt is traceable to fraud, and what it

19

said is -QUESTION:

20

But doesn't a consent judgment

21

always, at -- always hinge upon the existence of a cause

22

of action?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

1

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's right, and unless the

2

creditor can prove in bankruptcy that the debt that's now

3

reflected in -- in the settlement agreement is traceable

4

to an act of fraud, the creditor will lose the

5

nondischargeability action, and the only question is

6

whether the creditor should have the opportunity to

7

establish in bankruptcy that there is, in fact, an act of

8

fraud that -- that is reflected in and resolved by the

9

consent judgment.
The consent judgment that says expressly -- it

10
11

doesn't say there's no fraud.

12

compromise of disputed claims, and in exchange for the

13

release, what the creditor got was a clear carve-out from

14

that release for the right to enforce the $100,000 of debt

15

that's reflected in the promissory note.
QUESTION:

16

It says that this is a

It doesn't say there's no fraud, but

17

it does say that this indebtedness has nothing to do with

18

whether or not there was fraud.

fraud --

20

MR. GOLDBLATT:

21

QUESTION:

Whether or not there was

That's right.

The settlement --

-- this indebtedness exists.

It

22

seems to me it severs the connection between the fraud and

23

the indebtedness.

24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

But it is completely silent on

the question of whether fraud had occurred, just as the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consent judgment in Brown v. Felsen was completely silent

2

on the question whether that debt arose out of contract or

3

fraud.

4

the opportunity to look behind the fraud -- to look behind

5

the settlement to determine whether or not it was for

6

fraud, and there -- there's no difference here.

In Brown, this Court said that the creditor has

Your Honor --

8

QUESTION:

9

Would there be -- would there be a

difference if the settlement had expressly said, we

10

stipulate that there was no fraud leading to the creation

11

of the debt of -- for which this in effect is a -- a

12

novation?

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Souter --

Would that make a difference?
Justice Souter, that would be a

16

much harder case for reasons we set out in -- in our

17

briefs.

18

are reasons why such an agreement shouldn't be enforced,

19

but that would certainly be a much more difficult case

than this one.

But your argument here is we don't

really have to get to bankruptcy policy.

character of the debt.

Justice Souter.
The way this works in bankruptcy is that when

3

the debtor files for bankruptcy with this promissory note

4

outstanding for a hundred-and-some-thousand dollars, the

5

creditor comes into bankruptcy and files a proof of claim

6

saying, I have a claim of a hundred-and-some- thousand

7

dollars, and I'm entitled to my pro rata distribution on

8

that hundred-and-some-thousand dollars.

9

claim is on page 82 of the joint appendix.

10

The proof of

No one's contending that the release bars the

11

creditor from seeking recovery on the amount of that debt.

12

The only question is whether they can receive recovery in

13

the full amount of the debt by showing it's

14

nondischargeable, or whether they're limited to simply the

15

cents on the dollar that the claim will pay in bankruptcy,

16

because the text of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that

17

the form of the debt doesn't matter, that a debt -- that

18

under section 523, a debt can take any number of

19

different -- under -- I'm sorry.

20

Under section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, any

21

debt, the code says, is nondischargeable if it's traceable

22

to an act of fraud, and the code defines debt very broadly

23

to include debts that are liquidated, unliquidated,

24

reduced to judgment, et cetera.

25

of the debt doesn't matter, unless --

It's quite clear the form

QUESTION:

But the traceability does, and that's

what we're talking about here, how traceable is traceable.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's right, Justice Scalia,

4

and with respect to that question there is -- there is no

5

difference between a consent judgment that is a final

6

adjudication of the claims between the parties and a

7

settlement agreement, both of which are equally

8

preclusive, and both of which are equally silent on the

9

question of whether fraud occurred.

Unless the Court has further questions, I'll

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

19

When a creditor settles a fraud claim without

20

resolving the disputed issue of fraud, the creditor has

21

the right to enforce the settlement debt for the full

22

amount in bankruptcy by filing a proof of claim and by

23

establishing fraud in response to the defense of

24

But the real inquiry in Brown, as I

read it, is can we go behind a judgment to see what was

opinion.

8

MS. BLATT:

9

QUESTION:

It wasn't any

Right.
And I guess the holding is, yes, you

10

may go behind a judgment to see what was decided, and that

11

seems to me a little different from going behind a

12

settlement.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, didn't Brown decide two

separate issues?
MS. BLATT:

The Court in Brown did two things.

16

The Court -- the question of fraud was not litigated in

17

Brown because the case was settled, and the Court

18

mentioned in its last footnote that there would be a

19

different situation if the question of fraud was actually

20

litigated.

21

The question before the bankruptcy court in

22

Brown is whether the money owed under that consent

23

judgment was money obtained by fraud.

24

same question is relevant here.

25

QUESTION:

So, too, the exact

It didn't look to what the Court had

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decided, but what the claim was about, but here we have

2

something in addition.

3

was a complaint filed, and it was dismissed as part of the

4

settlement.

5

dismissed with prejudice.

6

There is a judicial order.

There

That complaint in the court action was

MS. BLATT:

What effect should that have?

Not -- a dismissal with prejudice

7

following a settlement.

As this Court stated in Lawlor

8

versus National Screen Service, it's cited in the reply

9

brief at page 9, is that it has -- does not have

10

preclusive effect on the disputed issue unless the

11

judgment is accompanied by specific findings on the

12

disputed issue, and that's the classic requirement for

13

issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, that the matter

14

be actually litigated.

15

QUESTION:

We're not talking issue preclusion,

16

just -- just as far as whether it suffices to terminate

17

the traceability.

18

coextensive with -- with whether there was issue

19

preclusion.

20

That -- that isn't necessarily

MS. BLATT:

No, the -- the dismissal with

21

prejudice doesn't impair the creditor's right to walk into

22

court and sue to enforce the settlement debt, including

23

the right to try to get the full amount of the settlement

24

debt in bankruptcy, and on this issue of traceability,

25

it -- it is not only identical to Brown, but the code by

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

its express terms disclaims any distinction between a

2

liquidated debt and an unliquidated debt.

3

in Brown and the settlement here converts an unliquidated

4

fraud claim into a liquidated claim to collect on the

5

settlement debt.
QUESTION:

6

The settlement

May I -- would you just clear up one

7

thing for me?

8

the contract was -- the novation was $200,000, in the

9

bankruptcy court do you contend they can get the full 300

10

Say the fraud claim was for $300,000 and

or just the 200?
MS. BLATT:

11

No.

Under -- under -- he would

12

be -- the -- the creditor would be bound by the settlement

13

agreement under principles of State law that the amount of

14

his debt would only be the $200,000.
QUESTION:

15
16

It seems like a strange result,

doesn't it?

17

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

18

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't he get the full amount?

19

QUESTION:

You conduct this big inquiry and find

20

out that the guy's been defrauded of $300, and then that

21

the settlement agreement really covers up a fraud and you

22

say, Well, but you know, a deal's a deal.

23

defrauded him of it and the whole thing's traceable to

24

fraud, we're only going to give you $200,000.

25

strange.

Even though you

MS. BLATT:

I'm sorry, are you talking about the

settlement agreement itself was procured by fraud?
QUESTION:

No, no, no, no.

No, the settlement

4

agreement was just an arm's-length agreement, but if you

5

find that, in fact, the debt underlying that -- that

6

agreement was fraudulently obtained, having gone through

7

all the trouble of determining that fact, why don't you

8

make the guy cough up all the money that he got by fraud?

9

MS. BLATT:

The Court -- the Court addressed

10

this very issue in Brown.

11

a fraud judgment for exemplary damages and special --

12

special damages under State law.

bankruptcy, of just seeking this settlement debt, and what

14

the bankruptcy code does is, it gives the creditor a

15

statutory right to render that settlement debt

16

nondischargeable if fraud can be -- can be shown.

18
19

The creditor there did not get

He was limited to, in

You don't -- and there's another way of looking
at it, too.

The Court --

QUESTION:

But -- but what's the policy reason

20

behind that.

I mean, if -- if what we're concerned about

21

is vindicating the Federal policy that the -- the

22

Bankruptcy Code protects only honest debtors and not

23

dishonest debtors, why not give them the whole $300,000?

24

I mean, I -- I know Brown didn't do that, but why didn't

25

it do that?

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BLATT:

The Court in Grogan -- it's because

2

of two issues, Justice Kennedy.

3

determines the amount of the debt that is owed, and

4

there's just no question, at least I don't think that the

5

creditor could make an argument that he's owed any more

6

than $300,000.

7

$600,000.

8
9

Under State -- State law

He can't relitigate and try to get up to

That's just governed by State law.
QUESTION:

Well, the Fourth Circuit -- the

Fourth Circuit says State law says that this is a

10

novation, too, so -- and you're -- you don't want us to be

11

bound by that interpretation of State law.

12

MS. BLATT:

The -- again, this Court in Grogan

13

versus Carter said that State law determines the amount of

14

the debt, and I just don't think the creditor would have a

15

good faith argument that he could go beyond the settlement

16

agreement, but on the question of nondischargeability,

17

what the creditor is trying to do is collect the entire

18

amount of the debt by -- by showing fraud, and we think

19

applying Brown --

20

QUESTION:

What their main argument, I think, on

21

the other side is, you get a debt, that's what it is, a

22

debt for money obtained by fraud, and this is not a debt

23

for money obtained by fraud, this is a debt for money owed

24

under a settlement agreement.

25

Now, the virtue of that is, it's a bright line,

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and what we're saying, I think, in the negative -- the

2

negative of it is that if you depart from that, well

3

there's no end to it.

4

and no matter how long you go into the future, whatever it

5

is, that -- whatever it says you're supposed to do in that

6

settlement agreement, it is.

7

cause, use whatever they want, but it is a debt.

8

comes from is the fraud.

9

You have a settlement agreement,

Use the words proximate
Where it

That's where the source of the debt is, no

10

matter what it says in that settlement agreement, and

11

there's just no stopping place, no way to look into it, no

12

attenuation forever, et cetera, so that's what I'd like

13

you to here address.

14

MS. BLATT:

15
16
17

Well, this Court already crossed

that bridge in Brown.
QUESTION:

Well, all right, so then maybe Brown

was wrong.

18

MS. BLATT:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. BLATT:

But the second point is that -Maybe it was wrong.
Whatever the limits of the

21

traceability point, which this Court addressed in a

22

separate decision, Cohen versus de la Cruz, which dealt

23

with the traceability aspects --

24
25

QUESTION:
never a problem.

There is no traceability.

There's

Underlying this was the fraud.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Whatever

1
2

it says in that settlement agreement is based on fraud.
MS. BLATT:

The code itself says that any

3

enforceable obligation, whether or not it's liquidated or

4

unliquidated or appears in a judgment, if you can prove

5

that there has been a fraudulent acquisition of money, the

6

resulting debt is nondischargeable, and that is --

7

QUESTION:

Ms. Blatt, what is your -- what is

8

the Government's position if the parties had expressly

9

dealt with it in the settlement agreement?

10

MS. BLATT:

We think the right would be subject

11

to waiver.

12

code that would be --

13
14
15
16
17

We don't think -- we don't see anything in the

QUESTION:

So you don't agree with petitioner's

counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?
MS. BLATT:

We think the right can be waived.

What we do think, though -QUESTION:

All right, now, the language in this

18

particular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out

19

of or relating to the matter of the State court

20

litigation.

21

Was that not a waiver of this claim?

MS. BLATT:

No, it certainly wasn't a waiver of

22

the right to collect on the debt, and in fact there's an

23

express preservation of not only the right to collect all

24

the obligations under the promissory note, but to collect

25

the amounts under the settlement agreement, and we think

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to apply a contrary rule, the rule that the court below

2

applied, would be unsound for three reasons.

3

It would force creditors and parties trying to

4

settle a case to start negotiating over bankruptcy

5

contingencies that are purely hypothetical, may never

6

happen, and are entirely extraneous to the settlement.

7

The rule adopted by Brown also, our second point, is that

8

it reflects the common sense and ordinary understanding

9

that settlements preserve the creditor's right to enforce

10

the settlement agreement and the statutory right to prove

11

fraud to render the debt enforceable, notwithstanding

12

bankruptcy, and that has been the premise of hundreds, if

13

not thousands of settlement agreements entered into by the

14

Government that do not refer to bankruptcy contingencies.

15

Third, to hold that those settlement agreements

16

waive the creditor's rights in bankruptcy would render

17

debts dischargeable even where the debtor committed fraud,

18

and that result would undermine congressional policy to

19

favor the rights of innocent victims of fraud over the

20

perpetrators of fraud.

21

QUESTION:

But you do agree that some fraud

22

claims could be waived as far as the dischargeability,

23

because you wrote the rights settlement agreement.

24
25

MS. BLATT:

Yes, if there was an affirmative

manifestation of an intent.

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

QUESTION:

Why isn't that inconsistent with the

statutory policy, just as this case would be?
MS. BLATT:

3

Because there is a background

4

presumption, Justice Stevens, that rights are subject to

5

waiver, and so if there's an intentional relinquishment of

6

a Federal statutory right, then a court can give that

7

effect, but not only is there silence on that issue in

8

this case, there is an express reservation of the right to

9

enforce the settlement agreement, and --

MS. BLATT:

To enforce the settlement agreement.
Yes, and that includes -But that's not a reservation of the

right to sue for fraud.

They're suing to collect on the settlement agreement for

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Alderson Reporting Company

2

it please the Court:
I would like to make four points this morning.

3

The first one, to pick up on what Justice O'Connor said, I

4

think there's a fundamental misconception in the question

5

as it's presented and as it was described by Mr. Goldblatt

6

this morning, and this conception is that what we're

7

dealing with here is a categorical rule that says that

8

whenever you have a settlement, because it's a contract,

9

it bars any further pursuit of a nondischarge claim.

10

That is completely inconsistent with the

11

holdings of the court below, all of which looked

12

specifically at the language of the release and concluded

13

that what had specifically been released was the right to

14

pursue the claim under 523.

15

Second --

16

QUESTION:

17
18

This would have been a release in

State court proceedings?
MR. AYER:

Correct, Your Honor, and -- and that

19

leads to the second point, which is that what is at issue

20

here really is the interpretation of the language, the

21

specific language --

22
23

QUESTION:

There's no language about 523, which

you just said --

24

MR. AYER:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
-- this is a standard settlement.

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It's a compromise.

2

One side is not admitting fraud, and the other side isn't

3

saying we've proved fraud.

4

MR. AYER:

Neither side is admitting anything.

It's just a zero on there.

Well, Your Honor, I think what you

5

said in terms of the language is certainly correct.

6

I think the important issue is that this is a settlement

7

and, indeed, there is also a -- a voluntary dismissal with

8

prejudice in a State court case.

9

proper analysis of that is to interpret the settlement

I would submit the

10

under State law and then ask the question, is there some

11

problem with Federal bankruptcy law that requires you to

12

somehow override what's been agreed to or what's been done

13

in State court.

14

QUESTION:

But isn't -- isn't the problem with

15

approaching it that way -- I -- at least, I think the

16

problem with approaching it that way is that there is no

17

State law analog to the issue that is being raised here.

18

In other words, under -- under State law, there was a

19

fraud claim, there was a settlement of the fraud claim,

20

but there is no issue under State law about bankruptcy,

21

and that is strictly a -- a Federal policy --

22

MR. AYER:

Well --

23

QUESTION:

-- and I don't know how we get --

24

we -- we look to State law to find out whether there is

25

doubt or not, but I don't know why State law should be a

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

source of an answer to this Federal question, which is

2

peculiarly Federal.

3

MR. AYER:

Well, I -- I don't think, Your Honor,

4

that it is the final answer, but it seems to me it's

5

entirely possible for parties in a State court proceeding

6

to enter into a settlement that says, and we hereby

7

specifically release our 523 claim, and had that been --

8
9

QUESTION:

They -- they might be able to -- I

mean, I'll assume for the sake of argument that they might

10

be able to do that, but in -- in that case, the -- the

11

issue here would be resolved, on -- on your theory,

12

certainly, by the express agreement with the parties, and

13

they didn't do that, so we've got a case in which they

14

didn't agree on the issue expressly, and I don't see why

15

State law, which doesn't have the issue, is a good place

16

to look for the answer.

17

MR. AYER:

Well, I think -- I guess my point,

18

Your Honor, is that the question of whether they expressly

19

agreed to it becomes a question of interpretation, and I

20

would like to get to arguing that they did, in fact,

21

expressly agree to it.

22

QUESTION:

The first --

Well, didn't Brown versus Felsen

23

suggest some discouragement to the idea of anticipatory

24

litigation in State courts of issues that would arise in

25

bankruptcy court?

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. AYER:

I -- I think Brown versus Felsen

2

certainly expressed the view that they didn't want to

3

encourage people to have to affirmatively determine fraud

4

in State court when it had been, in fact, been -- been --

5

the issue of nondischargeability had been put into the

6

bankruptcy court, but nothing in Brown versus Felsen in

7

any way qualifies the proposition that parties can, in a

8

State court proceeding, resolve, for example, by trial an

9

issue of fraud that would be preclusive under collateral

10
11
12

estoppel.
QUESTION:
proposition.

You say it doesn't qualify the

It doesn't address the proposition.

13

MR. AYER:

Correct.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose --

15

MR. AYER:

But it does, Your Honor, address it

16

in the sense, and then Grogan confirms that collateral

17

estoppel does apply, so that if you have a State

18

proceeding --

19

QUESTION:

There's -- there's no collateral

20

estoppel here.

That argument absolutely dumbfounded me,

21

frankly, because for collateral estoppel, issue

22

preclusion, you must have raised, actually litigated,

23

there must be a court determination of the issue, and that

24

determination must be essential to the judgment.

25

don't have any actual litigation here, so I don't know how

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

You

1
2

you can -MR. AYER:

Your Honor, under this Court's

3

Matsushita decision, it is perfectly clear that in order

4

to determine whether there's issue preclusion, you have to

5

look at the State law in the State where the judgment is

6

entered, and -- and the State law, as we indicate in our

7

brief, in North Carolina is that if you have a voluntary

8

dismissal with prejudice under the Miller Building case,

9

under the Barnes case, that voluntary dismissal with

10
11

prejudice resolves the issues that were put in issue -QUESTION:

The only decision that you cite from

12

the North Carolina Supreme Court says, we go down the line

13

with what is the standard understanding of issue

14

preclusion, actually litigated, decided, and essential to

15

the judgment.

16

MR. AYER:

Your Honor, I --

17

QUESTION:

That's what the North Carolina

18

Supreme Court said.

19

MR. AYER:

I disagree, Your Honor.

The -- the

20

Thomas McInnis case that you're referring to is a case

21

where what actually happened with regard to the issue of

22

whether prejudgment interest was available was that a

23

husband, in litigating that issue, in fact, failed to

24

timely raise it, and when he failed to timely raise it,

25

the wife was subsequently collaterally estopped from

Alderson Reporting Company

1

There's one sentence in the Thomas McInnis case

2
3

that says, we apply the usual principles of collateral

4

estoppel.

5

Carolina that are entirely clear that the rule is that if

6

you have a voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that

7

voluntary dismissal is determinative as though the matter,

8

and this of -- almost a quote, as though --

There are multiple cases, Your Honor, in North

QUESTION:

9

Well, that would certainly run

10

entirely against the stream, and it would run against the

11

Restatement of Judgments, which you cite, and that says

12

you must manifest -- yes, parties can make a stipulation

13

finding.

14

they can in the settlement, but they have to make that

15

manifest.

They can do it in a consent judgment just as

16

MR. AYER:

Right.

17

QUESTION:

The court does not infer that an

18
19

issue that was never litigated was, in fact, decided.
MR. AYER:

I guess what -- what I would like to

20

suggest to -- to the Court is that what we do have here is

21

a settlement of a State court litigation followed by a

22

voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that the effect of

23

that, of those acts, including the language, because

24

that's what the courts here -- all three of these courts

25

focus specifically on the precise language, and they

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

concluded that that language was a waiver.

that was -QUESTION:

I would submit

waiver of claim, and we don't have any -- I presume no one

5

6

is -- is a waiver on the disputed fact issue, and -- and

7

my -- my question to you is, you -- you refer to the

8

myriad State law cases that hold in your favor.

9

clear that those are cases on issue preclusion --

The question is whether there

MR. AYER:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

MR. AYER:

Yes, Your Honor --

QUESTION:

-- or res judicata?

14

MR. AYER:

The -- the Miller Building case and

15

the Barnes case, both of those cases involved collateral

that expressly addressed the -- the fact issue?

MR. AYER:

Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there

that a matter which is not actually litigated in the sense

15

that it went to trial and was determined after a trial or

If the parties intend for a settlement

QUESTION:

Well, are you relying on -- I thought

you were relying on North Carolina law.
MR. AYER:

We are.

I'm simply trying to point

23

out that the notion that there is some sweeping,

24

overarching general law that says it always must be

25

actually litigated, that that, in fact, is not correct.

QUESTION:

No, I -- no, no, we made it plain,

2

and I don't think there's any question here that the

3

parties can stipulate, and the stipulation will have --

4

will have the same effect as a finding, but, as the

5

Restatement of Judgments points out, that must be made

manifest.

7

and we stipulate that this claim is going to be

dischargeable in bankruptcy.

MR. AYER:

You don't imply it from words that don't say,

Well, what -- let me suggest to the

10

Court a -- a way in which this was clear.

11

I -- I do really want to emphasize that -- that all three

these cases are all about, all three of them, and the

question of whether the settlement released the claim is a

holding of all the courts below went beyond what Your

Honor is saying.

The words that you read --

-- are simply supportive of that --

MR. AYER:

-- let me -- let me --

-- but you can't -- you can't get

anything more than the amount of the promissory note that

results from the settlement.

MR. AYER:

analysis in all of these courts.

dischargeability claim which they now seek to assert.
QUESTION:

2

Well, that's a new, different issue

3

than we granted, isn't it?

I mean, that's -- the

4

question, I take it, is, we're assuming there is a

5

novation, there is a settlement, and fine, and that

6

settlement says, I promise to pay $200,000, so it's a

7

debt.

8

debt for money obtained by actual fraud?

It's a debt for money, and the question is, is it a

MR. AYER:

Well --

10

If so, how do we characterize that

MR. AYER:

I --

QUESTION:

You're saying it was, but it was

released.

I -- I don't see that we reach that.
MR. AYER:

Well, whether -- whether this is a

16

different issue than you granted, I guess -- I -- I agree

17

that the question as it was presented in the petition --

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. AYER:

-- is most easily read as this broad,

20
21

blanket rule.

That is not --

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I would assume that the

22

text and the wording here that you're relying on, and the

23

rule of the State about a novation and so forth, are --

24

are prevalent, not universal, but are -- are the standard

25

form of -- of settlement and release in almost every

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State, and apparently the novation rule is standard as

2

well, so the -- the result that you're asking us to reach

3

is that this also forecloses any Federal characterization

4

of this as being a debt incurred by fraud, and -- and

5

that's a very sweeping statement, and a very sweeping

6

rule.

7

MR. AYER:

Well, I -- I think -- I think there

8

is -- I think the ultimate question, and the last question

9

and the fourth question I'm hoping to get to, and I will

10

get to now, is the question of, if -- if you agree with me

11

for purposes of argument that initially, you look to see

12

what the State settlement does and, indeed, here also what

13

the effect under State law of the voluntary discharge with

14

prejudice is -- voluntary dismissal with prejudice is,

15

and -- and you see, as these courts below held, that the

16

effect is, in fact, to give up the right, then the

17

question is, is there something about Federal bankruptcy

18

law or policy that prevents parties from voluntarily

19

agreeing to do that?

20

QUESTION:

May I go back just one step?

Suppose

21

this settlement had been entered as a consent judgment,

22

just as was the case in Brown against Felsen, what then?

23
24
25

MR. AYER:

I think it would depend, Your Honor,

what was in the consent judgment.
QUESTION:

Nothing.

The Court just enters --

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's -- the parties' settlement is incorporated in the

2

consent judgment.
MR. AYER:

3

I -- I think it would become a

4

question of whether, under the laws of the place where the

5

consent judgment is entered, the fact that there's a

6

settlement that is somehow appended to that order, if it's

7

appended, whether that becomes limiting or defining of the

8

terms of what's agreed to.
If all you have -- I would agree with this.

9
10

all you have -QUESTION:

11

Wasn't -- in -- in Brown against

12

Felsen, there wasn't -- the settlement was not on the

13

record?

14

If

MR. AYER:

There's -- there's no discussion,

In fact, what's pretty clear in Brown versus

15

Your Honor.

16

Felsen, and the critical difference between Brown and this

17

case is that there was no -- there was no kind of any

18

release of a fraud claim.

19

and the -- the creditor got paid, and -- and nobody had

20

yet proven affirmatively that there was fraud.

21
22
23

You simply had the settlement,

What this Court said is, on those facts, you get
to come in and prove fraud.
QUESTION:

Okay, so you're -- you're then

24

conceding the following, is that right, that if, in fact,

25

I owe you $300,000 because I cheated you by fraud, we then

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enter into a settlement which might be approved by the

2

court, assume it is, and what that settlement says is, in

3

light of what you claim I did to you, cheat you through

4

fraud, I promise to pay $200,000, and you are conceding if

5

that's all there is to the case, that that is

6

nondischargeable?
MR. AYER:

7
8

there's no waiver of the right to argue -QUESTION:

9
10

I -- I am at least conceding that

Well, I want to know on my -- the

facts I just gave you --

11

MR. AYER:

Well, it -- it --

12

QUESTION:

-- in your opinion --

13

MR. AYER:

Your --

14

QUESTION:

-- is that 200,000 debt

15

nondischargeable?
MR. AYER:

16
17

that there was fraud, yes.
QUESTION:

19

If it amounts to a clear concession

No.

What I'm saying is, you have the

facts I gave you.

20

MR. AYER:

Okay.

QUESTION:

Remember what they were.

22

MR. AYER:

In consideration of --

23

QUESTION:

You said it was $300,000 obtained by

fraud.

I said, I will settle that by entering into this

piece of paper which says, I promise to pay 200.

MR. AYER:

I would -- I would say that that is

proving fraud, although you would --

There are -- there are too many

negatives in your statement.

yes or no?

MR. AYER:

It is not non -- it is --

that it is nondischargeable, but it is certainly not --

MR. AYER:

In the respect --

QUESTION:

In the release?

MR. AYER:

In the respect that our case included

courts as a release -- under State law as a release of the

right to go to bankruptcy court and pursue -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

12
13

Fine, and the reason that's in the

Yes, it isn't in the question

presented, that's what I thought.
MR. AYER:

14

The reason it's in the question

15

presented is because it's --it is the holding of the case

16

below.

17

QUESTION:

Well --

18

MR. AYER:

The case below doesn't --

19

QUESTION:

-- the -- the question presented,

20

Mr. Ayer, is whether a debt that would otherwise be

21

nondischargeable becomes dischargeable if the parties

22

enter a settlement agreement under which the amount of the

23

debt is -- it literally doesn't say anything about fraud

24

or collateral estoppel.

25

MR. AYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I guess

1

what I would say is that that question is -QUESTION:

2
3

You

just want to answer it, maybe, right?
MR. AYER:

4
5

You're answering the question.

Well, that's right.

The answer is

maybe, and it depends --

6

QUESTION:

Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

7

MR. AYER:

-- and what it depends upon is, has

8

there been a basis on which to conclude that that right

9

has been given up, and the answer is that no such basis

10

arises simply because there's a settlement contract.

We

11

do not claim that, and neither did any of the courts

12

below.

13

in this case who says, that's the rule of law.

14

can say it's not the rule of law and everybody will agree

15

with you, but that's not the issue in the case.

There -- there's nobody here in this courtroom or

QUESTION:

16

That you

Okay, taking your terms, everybody, I

17

guess, agrees that if the settlement agreement said, we

18

agree, the two parties, that there was no fraud involved

19

in the creation of the debt which this agreement settles,

20

that that would, in fact, be preclusive, that they could

21

not, in fact, prove fraud and -- and nondischargeability.

22

Why is the settlement here like the settlement I just

23

described, because that, as I understand it, is your

24

argument.

25

settlement we've got here, which says nothing about fraud,

There's no legal difference between the

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the settlement that I described in which fraud is

2

expressly addressed.

3

MR. AYER:

Why are the two alike?
Well, one reason why, and this --

4

this gets back to my point that I think you have to take a

5

State court settlement under State law first to understand

6

it, this -- this settlement, among the other language of

7

releases which we've talked about, also includes language

8

that commits to filing a voluntary dismissal with

9

prejudice.

10

Now, as I've indicated, in order --

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, isn't -- isn't that what any

neither party settlement does?
MR. AYER:

Well, it may or may not, Your Honor,

14

but in this case in North Carolina, under North Carolina

15

law, under Miller Building and Barnes, when you file a

16

voluntary dismissal with prejudice, it is as though the

17

matter were litigated to a conclusion and the plaintiff

18

lost, and --

19

QUESTION:

I thought that --

20

QUESTION:

So far as --

21

QUESTION:

I thought that was true, certainly

22

true as far as claim preclusion goes.

23

MR. AYER:

It's claim-precluded, but you

It's --

4

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor --

5

QUESTION:

-- and yes, a voluntary dismissal

6

with prejudice is preclusive of that claim.

7

bring that claim again, but it resolves no issues.
MR. AYER:

8
9

You can never

Well, Your -- Your Honor, that --

that is the law in many places.

That is not the law in

10

North Carolina, and I simply -- I know this Court doesn't

11

spend its time deciding State law issues, but -QUESTION:

12

I haven't seen a single North

13

Carolina Supreme Court decision that so holds, that a

14

voluntary -- I thought that North Carolina rules, by the

15

way, were based on the Federal rules with respect to the

16

voluntary dismissal rule.
MR. AYER:

17
18

similar.

19

parallel they are.

20
21
22

Isn't that so?

I -- I think the rules are somewhat

I've not studied them to know how precisely

QUESTION:

And -- and the voluntary dismissal is

claim-preclusive but not issue-preclusive?
MR. AYER:

Well, let me -- let me just quote,

23

because I -- I've found it -- the language in Miller

24

Building and Barnes is that a voluntary dismissal with

25

prejudice, quote, precludes subsequent litigation to the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

same extent as if the action had been prosecuted to a

2

final adjudication adverse to the plaintiff.
QUESTION:

3

All right, Mr. Ayer, let's assume

4

that that particular reason isn't necessarily going to

5

persuade all of us here.

6

say that the agreement, the settlement here should be

7

treated in law by this Court under the Bankruptcy Code

8

just like a settlement that expressly says there wasn't

9

any fraud?

Do you have any other reason?

MR. AYER:

10

Do you have another reason to

I think the language of the release

11

is quite clear.

The language of the release talks about

12

releasing any and all rights, including future rights.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but it's a question of Federal

14

law as to whether that includes a nondischargeability

15

claim.

16

I think that's --

I mean, that's what we're here to talk about, and

17

MR. AYER:

Well, let me --

18

QUESTION:

-- that's going to be the same in

19

every State, which is what I've asked.

20

question we asked, or I asked, was whether or not this was

21

a rule depends on the -- the vagaries of the law of North

22

Carolina or not.

23

25

MR. AYER:

The very first

Well -- and let me suggest, Your

Honor, that -- that in order -QUESTION:

And I would -- I would have to agree

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with what Justice -- Justice Ginsburg seems to be

2

indicating, that this -- that what you're saying is that

3

there's issue preclusion as to an issue that's never been

4

litigated.

5

MR. AYER:

Well, and the parties --

6

QUESTION:

That's astounding.

7

MR. AYER:

But I think we know under Arizona v.

8

California and other decisions that parties can do that if

9

they in -- if they indicate an intention to do it, and the

10

question is, have they done that here.

11

Let me --

12

QUESTION:

Can I ask -- this -- this puzzles me.

13

Is it, indeed, a question of Federal law whether a

14

contract which -- which gives up all future rights in

15

connection with this claim includes -- whether -- whether

16

the contract includes the right to claim

17

nondischargeability?

18

MR. AYER:

No, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Is -- is that a Federal question or a

20
21
22
23
24
25

State question?
MR. AYER:

I think -- I believe it's not, and I

really feel -QUESTION:

What do you -- you think it's a

question of State law?
MR. AYER:

I believe it's a question of State

Alderson Reporting Company

1

law.
QUESTION:

2
3

It's a question of Federal law what

the consequence --

4

MR. AYER:

Correct.

5

QUESTION:

-- of that State contract is.

6

MR. AYER:

Absolutely.

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

8

MR. AYER:

And let me address, if I could, what

9

I view as the logical way to think about this.

Once you

10

have a State contract that is given meaning under State

11

law, the question is, is that somehow to be modified or

12

overridden in light of Federal bankruptcy policy, and what

13

we have here, on the other side, I think, are two

14

different views.
We have one view of the petitioners that it can

15
16

never be done, there's no way, bankruptcy policy won't

17

allow it, and the other view of the Government is that,

18

well, you can do it if it's clear enough, and then you get

19

into nice questions of what, I guess, our Federal common

20

law --

21

QUESTION:

Your view, Mr. Ayer, would simply

22

encourage anticipatory litigation of issues that might

23

arise in bankruptcy, which I think Brown suggests is not a

24

good idea.

25

MR. AYER:

Your Honor, I think all -- all our

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

approach does is allow parties to enter into settlements

2

to be given what effect they have.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but, I -- I think here, too,

4

probably there's general agreement.

5

you say in the State court settlement, I waive my right to

6

claim nondischargeability in bankruptcy, probably

7

everybody would say, or a majority would say yes, but you

8

don't have that here.

9

MR. AYER:

If in so many words

Well, what it -- I mean, I guess the

10

next question would be, what else might be adequate, and

11

do you really want to develop a -- a body of Federal law.

12

Let me, if I could, just point to the arguments on the

13

other side why this should be treated as essentially a

14

Federal override of State law interpretive principles is

15

based first upon citation of a number of express

16

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code which have nothing to do

17

with the subject and, I think, prove the opposite point.

18

There's a whole section on debtor reaffirmations

19

which set up detailed procedures that the bankruptcy court

20

enforces to make sure that debtors don't get taken

21

advantage of, and they are specific, and they're clear,

22

and the bankruptcy court follows them.

23

for the bankruptcy court to get involved.

24
25

That's an occasion

There's the idea that the automatic stay cannot
be voluntarily given up.

Again, that's the product of

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

specific language that creates an automatic stay to

2

protect the debtor and has 18 itemized exceptions,

3

specific language.

4

provisions which let, of course, the bankruptcy court go

5

back into transactions that occur prior to bankruptcy, and

6

look at them on very specific terms set forth in section

7

547.

8

does the same thing in a slightly different way, but there

9

are no such provisions whatsoever with regard to waivers

There -- they invoke the preference

They talk about the fraudulent conveyance section

10

of section 523 claims.

11

that the creditor loses if he does not affirmatively file

12

within 60 days of the first meeting of creditors.

13

are no protections with regard to that in the code, and

14

if -- if something isn't filed, they disappear.

15

Section 523 claims are something

There

Indeed, the whole idea that creditors are --

16

that -- that the issues with regard to nondischargeability

17

under (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(15), are made a

18

matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, the reason for

19

that, and your case and Brown talk specifically about

20

that, was because creditors were abusing the process by

21

pursuing them.

22

This is a -- a way of making sure creditors don't come in

23

after bankruptcy and basically put the screws to -- to

24

debtors who have gotten a discharge.

25

This is not a protection for creditors.

What language there is -- and we talk about this

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in both the briefs, I think specific language runs counter

2

to this.

3

(a)(19), which specifically mention settlements, and I

4

would submit the better interpretation of that language is

5

to say, in those instances where the language specifically

6

says that any settlement may give rise to a

7

nondischargeable claim, is to allow the bankruptcy court

8

to go back in and look at those facts even if the right to

9

a nondischarge -- right to pursue nondischarge was given

10
11

We talked in the briefs about (a)(11) and

away.
I think the bottom line is that the arguments on

12

the other side relate to a series -- they don't relate to

13

any language of the code, other than the much overbroad

14

idea that it -- that it's any debt, and of course that

15

doesn't mean that a party can't be foreclosed from

16

litigating the 523 claim because he's already lost it in

17

State court, so any doesn't mean absolutely every.

18

The policies that are invoked are, first, the

19

honest but unfortunate debtor policy, but nobody here,

20

I think, seriously suggests that a party can't give the

21

thing away, give the right away if they want to, and so

22

I think -- give the right to pursue the 523 action away by

23

clear enough language.

24

petitioner I think disagrees with me, but other than that,

25

I think the better view is that they can, and I don't

That seems to be the -- the

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think this Court in any of its cases has ever suggested

2

that the honest but unfortunate debtor policy forecloses

3

relying on prior resolutions under State law.

4

estoppel certainly applies, and we think settlement

5

language that's clear ought to apply.

6

Collateral

They claim that allowing this is some sort of a

7

trap for the unwary.

It would be a trap if the rule were

8

this categorical rule that says, boy, you enter into a

9

settlement contract, you lose your 523 claim.

That's not

10

the issue in the case.

11

here support the -- the idea that the -- the right to

12

pursue the 523 claim has been given up, and to hold

13

parties to the State law effect of releases that they sign

14

is no trap for the unwary.

QUESTION:

question:

19

I'm just curious as to what three was.

20

You started out telling us you were going to

MR. AYER:

I know what one, two, and four are, but

Three was the State law point.

I --

21

I guess -- three was the point that when you look at State

22

law here, the reading of -- the fair reading of State law

23

does, indeed, support the State law rulings of all three

24

of the courts below, and point four, of course, is that

25

there's no reason in Federal law to go back and say no, we

have to second-guess that.
QUESTION:

I -- I suppose after this case, no

3

matter which way it goes, you can have an Archer clause

in -- in the settlement agreement.

5

settlement agreement in which the parties agree that it's

going to be nondischargeable.

course, do these clauses appear in contracts, or --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Okay.

Thank you.

I only have

18

four points.

First, with respect to the State law

19

question of preclusion, we say in our reply brief on pages

20

7 and 8 that that issue had been waived.

21

belabor that point, but I -- I will point out that the

22

brief respondent filed in the court of appeals, which

23

is -- which is, of course, in the record here, states

24

State law correctly.

25

appeals respondent said, there is no issue of collateral

I don't want to

There, on page 29 in the court of

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

estoppel in this case because there have never been any

2

evidentiary findings.
We submit that's a correct statement of State

3
4

law.

5

involved a case in which a settlement agreement is given

6

preclusive effect.

7

None of the North Carolina cases cited by respondent

Second, with respect to the language of this

8

particular release, it would certainly present a harder

9

case if you had a situation which the release said, we

10

give up all of our rights in bankruptcy, and in the event

11

you file for bankruptcy, we will not make any effort to

12

collect on the debt.

13

and expressly preserves the right at all points to recover

14

on the amount that was promised in the promissory note,

15

and this Court's opinion in Brown makes clear as a matter

16

of Federal law that what a nondischargeability action is

17

is simply an action to enforce the obligations that were

18

promised as part of the settlement.

19

This release is quite far from that,

Finally, the question of the form of the debt,

20

and whether the form of the debt drove the decision below,

21

there -- the court of appeals certainly does say -- and

22

this is in the joint appendix at page 8 -- I'm sorry,

23

page 9a, footnote 8.

24

basis for its decision is the notion that the creditor was

25

substituting the tort claim, the fraud claim for a

It explains quite clearly that a

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

contract claim and rests its decision on that basis.
The consequence of that decision would be that

3

from the creditor's perspective, if a creditor has an

4

unliquidated claim, and this applies not only to claims

5

for fraud but, say, an injury caused by drunk-driving, any

6

of the categories of nondischargeability, if you have an

7

unliquidated claim and they file for bankruptcy, you can

8

contend its nondischargeable.

9

If, on the other hand, you've litigated all the

10

way to judgment, under Brown you can say in bankruptcy,

11

even if the judgment doesn't say what it's for, that

12

that's nondischargeable.

13

situation in which the middle category, cases that are

14

resolved in settlement agreements that don't resolve the

15

question of liability, the rights in bankruptcy to show

16

nondischargeability is given up, and because the code

17

makes clear that the form of the debt is irrelevant to

18

persons of dischargeability, and because this Court's

19

decision in Brown versus Felsen is essentially

20

indistinguishable from this case, we submit the decision

21

below should be reversed.

22

QUESTION:

It would create an anomalous

It's rather unfortunate,

23

Mr. Goldblatt, that there's nobody in the room to defend

24

the position that I understood was taken by the question

25

presented, namely that a novation -- a novation is all you

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

need.

I think that's, at least, an arguable position,

2

but -- but nobody -- nobody seems to want to --

3

MR. GOLDBLATT:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

We agree that -- that --

-- discuss the issue on -- on which

we took the case.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Your Honor, we -- we agree, as

7

we say in our reply brief, that the principal basis of the

8

decision below has been abandoned by respondent here, and

9

we believe it's been abandoned because it can't be squared

10

with this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen, which

11

holds squarely to the contrary.

12

QUESTION:

Thank --

QUESTION:

What about the (a)(11) and (a) -- the

14
15

19, the express provisions for nondischargeability?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Your Honor, what Congress was

16

doing in -- in sections (a)(11) -- I -- I see my time

17

has -- has run out, but what Congress was doing in (a)(11)
