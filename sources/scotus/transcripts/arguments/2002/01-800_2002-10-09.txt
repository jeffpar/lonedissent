ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. FRIEDBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is at least a little irony in the fact

11

that Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27

12

years past the time when it started with Dean Witter and

13

Byrd the -- the move toward closing the courthouse doors

14

to public investors and forcing them into industry-run

15

arbitration.

16

place a hurdle in the way of the public investor who

17

ironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration

18

agreement.

19

Dean Witter is now back here attempting to

The issue today before the Court is the extent

20

to which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court

21

involvement to interfere with a customer's claims before

22

arbitration and -- and to decide whether the customer's

23

claims are timely under a section of an arbitration code

24

providing for a time limitation on eligibility.

25

is who decides.

The issue

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is clear that -- that over the years a

2

presumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where

3

there is an arbitration clause in a contract.

4

cases say that that presumption can only be overcome by

5

clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to

6

have a court decide arbitrability issues within a --

7

within the scope of an arbitration agreement.

8

case, there is no such evidence.

And the

In this

between the parties is as broad a clause as one can

imagine.

her and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account

13

or any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client,

14

whether or not it occurred in the account, or the

15

construction, performance, or breach of this or any other

16

agreement between us.

17

arbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible.

18

intent clearly is to move cases against brokers by

19

customers out of the courts and into arbitration.

20

The client agrees that all controversies between

It's an industry-designed
The

That -- that 1992 agreement was, of course,

21

followed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by

22

Ms. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned

23

party, she and her trust submit the present matter in

24

controversy, as set forth in the attached statement of

25

claim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

by-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration

2

procedure of the sponsoring organization.

3

it's the NASD, but the -- the other self-regulatory

4

organizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-

5

year rule.
QUESTION:

6

In this case,

It seems to me that some of the

7

language in First Options, which the respondent relies on

8

cuts against your case.

How -- how do you deal with that?

MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

Well, first of all, First

10

Options is a case in which there was a question about

11

whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the

12

case here.

13

wrote that -- that in that situation, the presumption

14

shifts.

15

And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court,

The AT&T case -- clearly the -- when the

16

question is just the scope of an arbitration agreement,

17

but there is no question about the existence of the

18

agreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable

19

evidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather

20

than the arbitrators decide.

21

QUESTION:

The respondents here, of course,

22

argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the

23

6 years, that limits the scope of the -- of the

24

arbitration agreement.

25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

The -- the respondent, of

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

course, is -- is referring to rule 10304, which says that

2

-- that disputes which arose out of transactions or events

3

more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to

4

arbitration.
First of all, that -- that rule is found in a

5
6

section of the arbitration code.

7

agreement itself.

8

of Arbitration Procedure.

And it's found in a section of the Code

QUESTION:

9

It's not found in the

Well, so is 10324 which you're

10

relying on.

That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to

11

interrupt and determine the applicability of.

12

that's -MR. FRIEDBERG:

13

I mean,

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

And

14

the point I was -- was trying to make is that -- that the

15

code has to be read as -- as one code in that -- in that

16

respect.

17

The -- it's also, I think, illuminating that the

18

-- the section, the 300 series of the code in which that

19

is found, is -- is not the eligibility section in the

20

sense that the 100 series is.

21

basically a procedural, instructive portion of the code

22

for the arbitrators to apply.

23

The 300 series is -- is

There is some -- we -- we've made the argument

24

and -- and I think it's a valid argument -- that eligible

25

for submission can mean a number of things.

And -- and

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that it refers, in this case to -- it could refer in this

2

case to when the arbitrators take the case under

3

submission, just as this Court takes the case under

4

submission after the petition, after the briefing, after

5

the arguments are made.
There -- there is, of course, the need to get

6
7

the case in front of a tribunal in order to -- to decide

8

whether or not the case is timely.

9

prevent the case from going all the way to the end zone,

So while the rule may

10

it -- it certainly doesn't prevent the -- the litigant

11

from or the -- the person arbitrating from -- from getting

12

out of the starting gate.

13

Moreover --

14

QUESTION:

Is -- is that your criterion, that --

15

that -- the -- on -- on the question of what -Â­

16

arbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front

17

of the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to

18

how long do you stay when you get there?

19

if -- if it's a question of whether you get there at all,

20

it's -- the question is arbitrability and the presumption

21

goes one way.

22

if you get in front of that person, that's not an

23

arbitrability question and the presumption goes the other

24

way.

25

In other words,

If the question is how long you stay there

Is that -- that's your point.
MR. FRIEDBERG:

That -- that is one point,

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Souter.
The -- the other point that -- that needs to be

2
3

made is that whether or not this is part of the code, part

4

of an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses

5

Cone case law as opposed to the First Options holding.

6

And in -- in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there

7

were prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing

8

for arbitration, which the Court said, because there was

9

an arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about

10

that, were for the arbitrators to decide.
In Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were -- there

11
12

were prerequisites of timeliness.

13

arbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an

14

opinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting

15

claims.

16

clearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration

17

Act establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts

18

concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be

19

resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract

20

involves construction of the contract language itself or

21

an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to

22

arbitrability.

23

The -- as I recall, the

And so -- and -- and the Court -- the Court

QUESTION:

-- definition of the domain of

24

arbitrability?

You're saying shall be eligible for

25

submission just means that the arbitration forum doesn't

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

get to the merits if more than 6 years have elapsed.

2

-- so you say that's not a question of arbitrability but

3

how the arbitrator will proceed.

4

What is your definition of arbitrability?

5

MR. FRIEDBERG:

But

Justice Ginsburg, our -- our

6

definition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than

7

that.

8

There is the --

9

But there is -- there is the merits arbitrability.

QUESTION:

Well, the question that doesn't go to

10

the arbitrator -- you're saying this one does.

11

he has to take it up first -- or she.

12

with, if it's a question of arbitrability, the courts

13

decide it.

14

the -- the range of other questions, then it's for the

15

arbitrator.

16

It's just

But we're dealing

If it's not a question of arbitrability, but

So my question is, what -- the domain for the

17

court -- the question is it arbitrable is a question for

18

the court.

19

What is the content of that label, arbitrable?

MR. FRIEDBERG:

It's a hard question for me to

20

get my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there -- there

21

is no question that in the first instance the court has to

22

decide whether a claim is -- is arbitrable.

23

the court finds that -- that there is an arbitration

24

clause that covers the merits of the dispute, then the

25

court should defer to arbitrators on any question

And -- and if

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regarding scope.

2

QUESTION:

Well, now --

3

MR. FRIEDBERG:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think --

-- this -- this is a contract matter.

5

Right?

I mean, if -- if the parties clearly didn't want

6

the arbitrator to do this and wanted the court to do it,

7

you -- you don't dispute that the court would do it.

8

Right?
MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

Right.

10

QUESTION:

11

Now, you concede the point that arbitrability is

12

for the courts.

So it's just a question of contract.

Right?

13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

14

QUESTION:

Right.

So presumably if 10304 had read no

15

dispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay,

16

under -- under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that

17

would -- would that exclude this from -- from the

18

arbitrator?

19

MR. FRIEDBERG:

20

QUESTION:

I believe not, Justice Scalia.

My goodness, it's using the exact

21

term that you concede sends it over to the -- to the

22

court.

23

MR. FRIEDBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

It -- what do you have to do beyond

using the -- the very word that you say bounces it to the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court?

They say it.

It shall not be arbitrable.

2

even that will not -- will not get it to the courts.

3

-- what does one have to do to get it to the courts?

4

MR. FRIEDBERG:

5

QUESTION:

And
What

Well --

And my next question is going to be,

6

is there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall

7

not be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for

8

submission to arbitration?

9

MR. FRIEDBERG:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FRIEDBERG:

12

I'm not --

And I don't think there is.
I don't think there is either,

Justice Scalia.

13

QUESTION:

14

me so hard on this.

Okay.

Which is why you're fighting

Right?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. FRIEDBERG:

17

I think what we have to do is look to the case

Precisely.

18

law, including the ATT case and -- and its progeny, and

19

First Options says the same thing really, that the court

20

has to decide in the first instance is there an

21

arbitration agreement.

22

it's undisputed -- that there is an arbitration agreement,

23

then the question is, does it go to the substance of the

24

case or is it a matter of the scope?

25

starting with the Gulf and Warrior --

Having decided -- and in this case

And the cases say,

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

What happened to the intent of the

parties?

3

MR. FRIEDBERG:

4

QUESTION:

That -- that's what --

I mean, you're talking as -- as

5

though this is some law being sent down from on high.

6

thought we established that step one is what did the

7

parties intend.

8

MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

QUESTION:

I

Right.

And you say that even if the parties

10

say it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter.

11

still go through this -- this game that seems to come down

12

from on high.

13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

We

But the question is who will

14

decide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and --

15

and Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once

16

you find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the

17

substance of the -- the dispute, then the question is did

18

the parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the

19

courts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that

20

scope issue.

21
22

QUESTION:

So then you're saying arbitrability

under our cases is not for the court necessarily.

23

MR. FRIEDBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I'm saying --

I mean, you can't have it both ways.
There -- there's a --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

If you say arbitrability is for the

2

courts, then if the -- if the agreement between the

3

parties says this is not arbitrable, that question of --

4

of whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the

5

courts.

6

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I think that's true for that

7

threshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues

8

that -- that may preclude ultimately submitting the case

9

to the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by

10
11

the court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley.
QUESTION:

I -- I didn't understand it that way.

12

I thought the question was not what the parties intend.

13

It's how we find out what they intend.

14

we're trying to decide between a tough burden of proof

15

standard on that that favors courts and where you apply no

16

burden of proof standard or, if anything, favor the

17

arbitration.

18

what the party intended.

19

court unless there is clear and convincing evidence they

20

wanted this arbitrable.

21

In both instances, we're trying to find out

Breyer, although --

23

QUESTION:

25

But we assume that they intended

Am I right?

MR. FRIEDBERG:

22

24

And I thought

I think you're wrong, Justice

Because?

Then I may not have stated

it correctly.
MR. FRIEDBERG:

I think what -- what the --

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

again, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the

2

parties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute.
QUESTION:

3

Yes, of course, and I thought what

4

my opinion said was that when we're trying to decide

5

whether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly

6

tough standard.

7

they did.

8
9

They have to show rather clearly that

What were the -- what was the word you quoted at
the beginning from the opinion?

Didn't you quote a phrase

10

that said on that -- in deciding whether an issue is

11

arbitrable, we apply the standard of?

12
13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I believe I quoted from the

Moses H. Cone --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I'm sorry.

You go ahead.

-- decision which -- which says

16

-- which says that the presumption is in favor of the

17

arbitrator's deciding.

18
19
20

QUESTION:
not communicating.
QUESTION:

I'll get the phrase and then -- I'm
I'm sorry.
I -- Justice Ginsburg asked a

21

question that I'm also interested in.

Quite apart from

22

the reference of -- in the agreement to the fact that the

23

arbitrator shall decide this, your second argument, on

24

your first argument, what do you want me to say if I write

25

the opinion or another member of the Court writes the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

opinion in your favor?

If the essence of the dispute

2

involves the particular issue, then that is arbitrable and

3

that's for the arbitrators to decide?

4

MR. FRIEDBERG:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

us to write.

No.

I --

I -- I just don't know what you want

It's the same question Justice Ginsburg had.

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Justice Kennedy, it's basically

8

what was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back

9

to the court to decide who decides certain questions.

10

Court should decide in this case that where there's a

11

valid, written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter

12

or the merits of the dispute, particularly where the

13

arbitration clause encompasses all controversies and the

14

parties have not clearly and unmistakably reserved certain

15

issues of arbitrability for a court decision and -- and I

16

mean, within the scope as opposed to the basic dispute --

17

the presumption in favor of arbitrability should apply,

18

and issues relating to the scope of the arbitration

19

agreement are for the arbitrators.

The

20

And in this case -- AT&T, when the Court sent

21

the case back to the lower court said, these issues are

22

for the arbitrators to decide unless you find unmistakable

23

evidence that the parties agreed -- and this is the intent

24

of the parties -- that the court would decide.

25

I -- I would like to reserve --

QUESTION:

Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with

2

the Government?

The Government did say there are two

3

considerations.

The first one you agree with obviously,

4

whether the parties entered into a binding arbitration

5

agreement.

6

question, that is, whether the subject matter of the

7

dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.

8

are the two things.

9

the one, did they agree to arbitrate.

10

And then the Government says there's a second

Those

You seem to be saying there's only

MR. FRIEDBERG:

No.

I'm not -- obviously I'm

11

not doing a very good job of expressing our position.

12

Where the subject matter of the dispute, the merits-

13

related issue -- as in First Options, it was the question

14

of whether the Kaplans owed money or not -- is within an

15

arbitration agreement, then any ancillary type dispute as

16

to timeliness should go to the arbitrators to --

17

QUESTION:

What -- what if I have an arbitration

18

agreement that says all -- all disputes arising from an --

19

an accident on the employer's premises shall be

20

arbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident

21

occurred on the employer's premises or not?

22

parties -- or the -- the employer contends that this

23

injury occurred elsewhere entirely.

24

it occurred on the premises or elsewhere?

25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

One of the

Who decides whether

I think in the first instance

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the court would decide that because the parties did not

2

agree to arbitrate any claims.

3

QUESTION:

4

Why is that different from here?

The

parties --

5

MR. FRIEDBERG:

6

QUESTION:

Because --

-- did not agree to arbitrate any

7

claims that -- with -- with regard to an accident that did

8

not occur on different premises, but that incurred --

9

occurred more than 6 years before.

10

MR. FRIEDBERG:

11

QUESTION:

Because --

They didn't agree to arbitrate it.

12

They said it shall be -- shall not be eligible for

13

submission to arbitration.

14

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Because of the principle,

15

Justice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the

16

Moses H. Cone --

17

QUESTION:

But I don't see how that principle

18

applies -- doesn't apply here, but applies in the other

19

premises situation.

20

between the two.

21

I -- I just don't see any distinction

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I -- I think because the Court

22

has previously said that a timeliness issue is -- is a

23

procedural issue.

24

substantive issues, of course, but --

25

It's intertwined with -- with

Well, can't you make it a -- I mean,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

18

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

19
20

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

21

For two reasons the question whether

22

petitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time

23

limit is for the arbitrators to decide.

24
25

First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in
John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration,

2

the question whether the dispute was presented within a

3

contractual time limit is presumptively for the

4

arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that

5

conditions the duty to arbitrate.

6

Second, the time limit in this case is imposed

7

by the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure, which the

8

parties incorporated into their agreement in full.

9

QUESTION:

What is -- what is the general

10

principle that Justice Ginsburg was asking for that

11

controls your first conclusion?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

Arbitrability is, as used

13

in the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two

14

questions.

15

are bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other

16

question is whether the subject matter of their underlying

17

dispute is within the scope of that agreement.

18

subject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is

19

whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the

20

primary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to

21

the underlying claim.

22

One of those questions is whether the parties

And by the

And what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is

23

once the parties -- once the court has determined that the

24

parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of

25

the -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

questions about their litigation conduct and how those --

2

how that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are

3

presumptively for the arbitrators to decide.
QUESTION:

4

What was the text in John Wiley &

5

Sons?

6

did the agreement say that no controversy shall be

7

eligible for submission to arbitration?

8
9

What was the language of the agreement?

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Did it --

The -- the

agreement didn't use that -- that language.

It said the

10

failure of either party to file a grievance within this

11

time limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an

12

abandonment of the grievance.

13

QUESTION:

Why?

But the point --

That -- that seems to me -- let

14

me put -- it's the same question.

Let me put it to -- to

15

you another way.

16

reading of this clause, shall be -- shall not be eligible

17

for submission to arbitration, and the -- the way you

18

would read a clause which said, no dispute, claim, or

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

6

MR. ROBERTS:

The --

This is not phrased as a statute.
There may be differences, Your

7

Honor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the

eligible for submission language, what that indicates is

that the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to

10

arbitration of the merits of the claim.

MR. ROBERTS:

You presume -- you presume that

2

because if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that

3

they would arbitrate about disputes arising from the --

presumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have

anything to do with any questions connected with such a

dispute.

But when they did -- no.

They didn't think they were going to

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

When --

And therefore, they didn't think the

language of -- of the parties and parse that language to

10

see whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to

11

then decide whether the presumption in favor of courts

12

deciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra

13

layer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to

14

reflect the -- the real intent of the parties.
The -- what we're trying to figure out is not

15
16

whether the parties thought this was a question of

17

arbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who

18

they intended to decide the question.

19

the underlying claim is within the scope of their

20

agreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary

questions would be decided by the party that they

It reflects their intent that --

MR. ROBERTS:

9

Yes.

So what the NASD

Is that

It's -- it's concerned --

10

the -- the code is concerned with the rules of the

11

arbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators

12

are the ones to interpret and apply those rules.

13

that's confirmed by Rule 10324.

And

But -- but yes, the -- the question whether a

It has been mentioned in

What did the parties intend?

In response to the specific question posed by

pertinent.

arbitrate the particular grievance, not whether there's an

-- and the NASD has described -- and we set this forth at

makes no sense whatever, and indeed it's inconsistent with

But you can agree to a temporal

restriction and still not commit yourself as to who

decides whether that restriction is true.

right, and so you then go to what is that temporal

restriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction.

In that submission agreement, the petitioner did, indeed,

agree to submit the issue for arbitration to the NASD

under the rules.
QUESTION:

To one of three -- I think

under this Court's presumption -- this Court's law and

it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act as well

-- it makes sense for the courts to be the gatekeeper.

And I want to come, if I may, to Justice

Souter's concern about litigation chaos.

11

The rule that is being suggested here ushers in all manner

of difficulties and we would describe or refer the Court,

in particular -- this is in our brief -- to the Edward

the following kind of question.

16

No one went to court, but an eligibility defense offered

17

to the arbitrators.

18

20
21
22

To the contrary.

The Seventh Circuit had before it
Eligibility claim made.

The arbitrators simply noted it.

Some of these arbitrations go on for years.
Literally 2 years is not unknown in the industry.
In that particular case, the arbitrators never
decided the eligibility issue.
And the NASD has said this -- we refer you to

23

page 7 of our brief, as well as page 25.

There was a need

24

for the eligibility rule -- for that rule to be clear and

for there to be a gatekeeper.

says, this rule says -- one interpretation of it,

plausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the

eligibility question first.
Do you agree, Mr. Starr, that this 6-year rule

is a rule for the arbitration forum?

13

dispute.

14

This is a limit, as I understand it, this 6-year

MR. STARR:

That is correct.

But the issue is

15

who then decides whether this forum -- who is the

16

gatekeeper?

17

That's what's before you.

QUESTION:

That's now -- now, that's my puzzle

18

because isn't it odd that a limitation period that applies

19

only in the arbitration forum is then decided by a court

20

where the court would have a different limitation?

21

MR. STARR:

Not -- not at all because if there

22

is a different limitation -- and, indeed, 10304 draws the

23

very distinction between the eligibility requirement to

24

get in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of

25

limitation which might vary.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Now, the 6-year limitation -- the eligibility

2

rule -- and we would guide the Court back to the meaning

3

of the word eligible for submission.

4

clear, but we think it's clear for the reasons Chief Judge

5

Becker said.

6

the NASD has said.

But we would again refer the Court to what
It is a substantive jurisdictional --

QUESTION:

7

We think that's

It said more than that.

I mean, it

8

said -- you quote it on page 25.

It said -- and this -- I

9

wanted to ask you how that got into the Federal Register.

10

It said, the courts determine the scope of the agreement

11

to arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for

12

arbitration on subject matter, timeliness, or other

13

grounds.

14

doing in the Federal Register?

15

MR. STARR:

And that's the NASD in the Federal -- what's it

Yes.

The self-regulatory

16

organization, which is what the NASD and the exchanges

17

are, submit their proposed rules to the SEC which could

18

change this at the stroke of a pen.

19

for lo these years while these issues have been

20

languishing in -- in the courts.

21
22

QUESTION:

I -- I would like to get back to the

question --

23

MR. STARR:

24

QUESTION:

25

It has not done so

Yes.
Well, why is these interpretations

that are not part of the agreement that the respondent or

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the petitioner here signed -- why are they binding on the

2

petitioner?
MR. STARR:

3

Because she agreed in the submission

4

agreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of

5

procedure.

6

signed, which goes back to paragraph 19 --

It's an express agreement by her which she

QUESTION:

7

Well, so we're just talking here,

8

when you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in

9

the code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?

10

MR. STARR:

No.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

said something else.

13

MR. STARR:

I thought -- I thought you

What I tried to say is that the NASD

14

has described the reasons for the rule to which she

15

agrees.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STARR:

Well, why should that bind her?
It binds her only in the sense of it

18

helps the Court understand what the background of the rule

19

is.

20

does the rule mean and what's the purpose of the rule.

21

think, Mr. Chief --

22

QUESTION:

She is bound the rule.

We are now moving to what
We

Well, supposing I enter into a

23

contract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something,

24

and then Sears has a publication which says, you know,

25

here's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty.

And

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then Sears puts out a magazine and says, what we really

2

mean in this warranty is A, B, C.

3

doesn't affect the terms -- how you interpret the terms of

4

the warranty.
MR. STARR:

5

Now, certainly that

There may very well be, under those

6

circumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract.

7

The other side doesn't dispute that there is a

8

contract and that the NASD rule is a part of the contract.
QUESTION:

9

But it's the NASD's interpretation of

10

the rule.

11

a view as to what the contract means, I just don't think

12

it binds the other side.

13

I mean, if you have a private entity expressing

MR. STARR:

I'm not suggesting binding

14

authority.

15

by the NASD's explanation, which also goes to the purpose.

16

Why is this?

17

is a rule that is borne of experience of the entire

18

industry --

19

I'm suggesting that illumination is provided

Is this simply an arbitrary rule?

QUESTION:

No.

It

But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a

20

question about the meaning of the rule?

It may not really

21

be germane to this ques -- but I've been puzzled.

22

Supposing you had a case in which the conduct occurred 7

23

years ago and it was fraudulently concealed until 1 year

24

before the arbitration is requested.

25

arbitrable or not?

Would that be

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STARR:

Well, there would be an issue that

2

the Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or

3

event.
QUESTION:

4
5

Well, I'm talking about the

occurrence is 7 years ago.
MR. STARR:

6

And -- and in terms of purchase or

7

sale of security, it might very well that that would not

8

be arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence

9

or event.

There are also, as the Court knows, statutes of

10

repose in the statute of limitation -- in -- in the

11

Federal securities context as well.

12

But the point is the --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

So this is an absolute rule without

any tolling provision.
MR. STARR:

That's correct.

It -- it is a

16

absolute eligibility rule that simply tells the person --

17

and again, there's no choice here in the sense of if she

18

had gone to the New York Stock Exchange or the American

19

Stock Exchange because the rule is exactly the same.

20

QUESTION:

But I'd -- I'd like you to go back to

21

what I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's

22

initial question.

23

What is this term arbitrability?

That the context -- I've gotten not to an

24

answer, but I've gotten to a beginning with First Options.

25

First Options says that the question of whether you agreed

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to arbitration is basically a matter of intent and apply

2

State law.

That's the basic rule.

3

Then there's a subsidiary rule.

4

is, but if what you're interested in is whether the

5

parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability

6

-- see Justice Ginsburg says what is that -- at subsidiary

7

rule, what you do is assume that silence means no because

8

only if it's clear and unmistakable.

9

The subsidiary

Then First Options goes on to say we'll give you

10

a couple of examples.

11

particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it

12

was within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement,

13

that is not a question of arbitrability.

14

Because the parties, after all, have a contract for

15

arbitrability.

They thought about the question of

16

arbitrability.

It won't -- it -- it's all very likely

17

that they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable.

18

then they give you an example of where it is, where there

19

is no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties

20

never thought about arbitration, in all likelihood.

21

An example whether or not a

Why not?

And

Now, with those examples, it seems to me that

22

we're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the

23

question Justice Ginsburg asked.

24

contract and it's a thing they likely thought about and

25

it's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's

Well, if there's a

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something that the arbitrator knows about and courts

2

don't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in

3

the sense of requiring a special presumption.

4

there's nothing at all in writing, if it's something

5

courts know about, there is.
All right.

6

That's where I am.

But if

That doesn't

7

help you because I think in this case, yours would fall in

8

the first category.

9

response because I -- I need my thinking developed on

10
11

But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a

this.
MR. STARR:

Justice Breyer, I believe that the

12

question of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that

13

question is guided by the -- is determined by the intent

14

of the parties.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. STARR:

And we agree with that.
We now look to the contract.

17

There's some discussion as what does the contract include.

18

The parties have been in agreement that the contract

19

includes the rules, including 10304.

20

specific and targeted provision, that we then go to that

21

rule, and we say, what is the parties' intent with respect

22

to whether this issue is eligible -- this matter, dispute,

23

claim, or controversy shall be eligible for submission.

24

It does not say specifically the courts are going to

25

decide that.

Right?

That is the most

But the First Options presumption,

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

since the language is not clear that the court shall

2

decide it, is that that is the baseline.

3

fact, the default position unless, indeed, the parties

4

have clearly and unmistakably provided that that is an

5

issue for the arbitrator.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. STARR:

That is, in

Which brings you to 10324.
And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly

8

worded provision that says on its face that the

9

arbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the

10

like, the provisions of the code.
Several points.

11

The first is this is a very

12

general, as opposed to a quite specific, provision, and

13

when we then analyze it, and we analyze it in the context

14

of the remainder of the code -- and I would guide the

15

Court especially to rule -- or section 10104 that says

16

arbitrators shall be appointed --

17

QUESTION:

Where do we find that in your brief?

18

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

20

MR. STARR:

21

And that's 10304.

10104 is at page 35 -Thank you.
-- of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice.
And then at the bottom

22

paragraph, 10104 says that arbitrators shall be appointed

23

by whom?

24

shall be eligible for submission under the code.

25

words, when we take the code and we look at various

11

those provisions are not ones that the court decides

either.

13

And I'd like you, Mr. Starr, to tell me why I'm

14

wrong, because I take it from your argument you would say

I'm wrong, in saying we have an agreement to arbitrate

1

What is wrong with that division?

2

MR. STARR:

Because it is building in a

3

procedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of

4

way of looking at the code as opposed to determining --

5

and you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of

6

limitations.

7

would guide the Court again -- refer the Court to the

8

second sentence of 10304 which draws the distinction --

9

this also goes back to Justice Kennedy's question -- that

This is not a statute of limitations.

The issue of eligibility is, in

So then am I correct -But --- that if the -- if the claimant

court?
MR. STARR:

2

Well, you're suggesting a procedural

3

issue, namely, filing an answer which suggests to me that

4

the company has, under those circumstances, agreed for the

5

arbitrators to decide that issue.
QUESTION:

6
7

Why?

Why?

The whole reason for

filing the answer is to get it out of the arbitration.

8

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

10

MR. STARR:

No, I'm sorry.
That's why you file.

Go ahead.

You can, under those circumstances,

11

say the arbitrators -- I will allow the arbitrators to

12

take this initial cut at that.

QUESTION:

But you can, but what if you don't

14

say that?

1 month and for that reason this eligibility question is

16

jurisdictional and it goes to a court?
MR. STARR:

What if you say, I am saying it was 6 years and

Exactly.

Exactly.

And that's

what -QUESTION:

All right, and if that's what they

20

say, then they go to the court.

21

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

That's right.
So all they've got to do is file a

23

paper and we're out of arbitration and into court.

What you would do under those circumstances is

You would, in fact, say you go to

say that the accident occurred somewhere other than in the

You're saying this is an eligible arbitration.

are you going to stand on your rights under the contract.

exactly what happened in Sorrells.

MR. STARR:

Can you step back one second -- one

Because I'm seeing

6

it not as a matter of detail.

arbitration in this area is either neutral or sometimes

favorable to arbitration.

What we're after is the

10

The one exception is where the parties may or may not have

interestingly enough, use a presumption that's very

hostile to finding the intent to have the arbitrators

arbitrate arbitrability.

how does that apply here?

it shouldn't apply at all.

that box, then I think we're right into what Justice

10

Kennedy said and that's the end of the case.

11

it's only those words, clear and unmistakable, that help

12

you, and that's what I mean by the hostile presumption.

13

MR. STARR:

But, I mean,

But again, the presumption and the

14

analysis in First Options goes to where, in fact, the

15

parties have not spoken to this issue.

16

parties have spoken to the issue through the NASD rules

for the reasons that we have stated, and that is, it's not

18

that we're seeking to build in some new presumption.

relying on is the intent of the parties as articulated in

2

for the rule.
QUESTION:

3

Can I -- can I ask you about the

4

rules, about 10324 in particular which deals with the

5

interpretation of provisions of code?

6

MR. STARR:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
I assume your -- the -- the other

8

side says that -- that that provision gives the arbitrator

9

the power to decide whether 6 years have elapsed or not.

10

If it did that, I suppose it would also give the

11

arbitrator the power to decide whether the injury was one

that occurred in the work place; that is, whether the

subject matter was also --

they are empowered to interpret the code.

passing strange to suggest that prior to arbitration a

number of the provisions of the code precede the

appointment of the arbitrators and go to the powers of the

The dispute might be alive for 12 years

8

Isn't it odd that -- to read a contract to say

9

that a rule governing only the arbitration forum and not

the court is decided by the court?
MR. STARR:

It's not odd in this context where

12

the original agreement -- there was not, Justice Ginsburg,

13

an agreement, in paragraph 19 of the original client

14

access agreement, to arbitrate in some generic,

Ginsburg is resisting -- I'm inferring -- resisting the

It is the same principle in terms of

What I was saying is that there's a

I think, with all due respect, that that interpretation
