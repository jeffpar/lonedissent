ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BUSCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a gang-related murder in

12

which a jury found the defendant guilty beyond a

13

reasonable doubt.

14

defendant was sentenced to life in prison.

15

There was one trial conducted, and the

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its

16

conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision on

17

double jeopardy was unreasonable.

18

habeas corpus relief where a State court makes reasonable

19

factual determinations.

20

decision was not only reasonable, but also correct.

21

The Michigan Supreme Court's decision was

22
23
24
25

The AEDPA precludes

The Michigan Supreme Court's

correct for three reasons.
First, this was a factual matter which was
reasonably decided.
Second, the trial judge's --

1

QUESTION:

When you -- when you say this was a

2

factual matter, I got the impression that as to basic

3

facts, there really wasn't any dispute about them.
MR. BUSCH:

4

Mr. Chief Justice, the Michigan

5

Supreme Court was evaluating what exactly this trial judge

6

said.

7

he said, then we could understand, or they could

8

understand what he had done and what legal import that

9

had.

10

It was ambiguous.

QUESTION:

And in trying to determine what

But -- but there was no -- all I'm

11

saying, there was no doubt about what -- what he said.

12

The -- the legal import is -- may be much more difficult

13

to figure out.

14

MR. BUSCH:

Your Honor, the factual question in

15

terms of what it was that he said is -- is different than

16

what he had actually done.

17

understanding what this judge had done or said, the

18

meaning of it, then would give us some understanding of

19

what the legal import was.

20

QUESTION:

And therein lying --

Well, I guess there are really three

21

questions, aren't there?

One is what he said, and

22

there -- as the Chief Justice says, there's no dispute on

23

what he said.

The second question is what he meant by

24

what he said.

And the third question is, once you know

25

what he meant, at law does that constitute a -- a final

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

judgment.

2

MR. BUSCH:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
So there are three questions, and --

4

and which one -- is the middle one, what he meant, as

5

opposed to what he said -- is that a factual or a -- or a

6

legal one?

7

MR. BUSCH:

That -- it would be our position

8

that it is a factual question and courts -- the Court in

9

Parker versus Dugger and Wainwright versus Goode have

10

dealt with this issue.

11

a trial judge, that has been found to be a factual --

12

QUESTION:

Where we have ambiguous rulings of

I'm not sure actually -- your

13

inference.

14

wouldn't say necessarily that what he meant has anything

15

to do with it.

16

world, and if he had a secret meaning, we don't care nor

17

does the law.

18

the world, then the question would be, can the Michigan

19

Supreme Court -- does it -- did it -- it characterized

20

those things, and it said as a matter of Michigan law,

21

those things said in the world do not amount to a judgment

22

of acquittal.

23

I mean, it's quite a fine point, but I guess I

That is, he said certain things in the

But having said these particular things in

So then I guess we would -- if that's the way to

24

look at it, then we would have the problem of deciding

25

whether, even though as a matter of Michigan law, those

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

events that took place in the world do not amount to a

2

judgment of acquittal.

3

Federal Double Jeopardy Clause, do they amount to a

4

judgment of acquittal?

Nonetheless, for purposes of the

5

Those would be two legal questions.

6

State law question, and one, a Federal question, and no

7

factual question.

8

MR. BUSCH:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

One, a

Well -But that's something of a quibble

because I don't know that leads us to a different place.
MR. BUSCH:

The Michigan court found that this

12

trial judge's decision was, in fact, tentative.

13

decision and conclusion was reasonable.

14

page 12 of the joint exhibit, speaks of -- and if I could

15

turn to that page.

16

my impression is at this time -QUESTION:

18

MR. BUSCH:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BUSCH:

22

The judge, at

The judge starts out by saying, well,

17

21

And that

What page?
Page 12 of the -Page 12 of what?
At the bottom of page 12 of the

joint -- the joint appendix.

Excuse me.

The court says, nothing?

Well, my impression at

23

this time is that there's not been shown.

And then at

24

page 18 of the same exhibit, the court actually schedules

25

an 8:30 motion the following day when the prosecutor in

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this case -- the assistant prosecutor asked the court if

2

he could be heard.

3

hear you.

4

the attorneys to be there at 10:00 and then changed the

5

time for them to show up before the jury came back.

6

And the judge said, I'll be glad to

And in fact, the court had originally scheduled

And lastly I think it shows that no one who was

7

involved in this case at the trial level actually believed

8

that a final ruling had been made.

9

page 34 -- excuse me.

The court says at

The defense counsel says -- and I'm

10

quoting Mr. Odette -- that's correct.

They don't -- I'm

11

not disputing that, but it's my firm impression that when

12

I left the court yesterday, that there had been a ruling

13

and that Mr. Stamos had indicated he'd like to have the

14

matter reconsidered.

15

whatever.

And I believe the court said,

And what's instructive is what the judge said

16
17

next.

That's right.

18

glad to listen, or words to that effect.

19

Lastly --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

And I -- well, I said, yes, I'd be

What about the docket entry?

Was

there a docket entry too?
MR. BUSCH:

There was a docket entry which was

23

made by a clerk which was not reviewed by -- and which is

24

not reviewed by the trial judge.

25

docket entry isn't dispositive of whether or not the judge

And in Michigan, the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

had made a final ruling of acquittal or a judgment of

2

acquittal.
QUESTION:

3

May I -- may I just ask you a further

4

question to make sure that I understand the -- the sort of

5

the assumption behind your argument?

6

same question that Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia I

7

think were -- were raising.
My understanding is that the courts, up to this

8
9

And it's really the

point, have treated the issue here as an issue of fact.

10

What was the judge -- what did the judge think he was

11

doing?

12

understand that the had made a final ruling or not?

Did he understand or could one reasonably

It might also have been treated as an issue of

13
14

law.

15

made a final ruling, he might, as a matter of law,

16

consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, have been able

17

to change his mind if he hadn't issued a formal order and

18

if no one had acted in reliance.

19

Given what the judge did, even if he thought he had

But I understand that legal question, the way I

20

just put it, is not the question that people understood

21

has been decided in this case, and that everybody is

22

treating this as a -- as an issue of the factual question

23

and that's what you're addressing.

24

MR. BUSCH:

25

QUESTION:

Am I correct?

That's correct.
Okay.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BUSCH:

The Court has also -- and without

2

conceding my case, in the alternative, if this Court was

3

to conclude that this judge had, in fact, issued or made a

4

judgment of acquittal, it would be the people's position

5

or the petitioner's position that the trial court need not

6

be able to reconsider to reach a just result because

7

they -- they rule so swiftly.

8

Michigan court was correct because judges, trial judges in

9

particular, need time to reflect.

In other words, the

They're often making

10

these decisions without trial transcripts, in many cases

11

without extensive legal research.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Busch, this case here

13

come -- the case comes to us under -- under AEDPA; that

14

is, that you don't have to show that the Michigan Supreme

15

Court was correct as a matter of law in its decision.

16

have -- your -- your opponent has to show that either it

17

was an unreasonable application of our precedents or

18

contrary to our precedents, if it's a legal question, and

19

if it's a factual question, that the Michigan Supreme

20

Court made unreasonable findings of fact.

21

MR. BUSCH:

Exactly.

You

And also, this Court has

22

held and the statute requires that that finding of fact be

23

presumed to be correct.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Busch, why wouldn't it be

unreasonable if, as respondent asserts, the Michigan rules

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

provide that a directed verdict made at the close of the

2

evidence, that the judge may not reserve decision, must

3

decide it, may not reserve decision.

4

the judge ended up doing here, is that not so?

5

reconsidered, he reserved decision 'til the end of the

6

defense case.
MR. BUSCH:

7

I think that's what
When he

Yes, and in fact, in this particular

8

case, the judge did not come to a conclusion as to -- did

9

not enter a verdict of acquittal.

In this particular

10

matter, the court held -- in that particular circumstance,

11

it said in the opinion that it was harmless error in their

12

opinion.

However -QUESTION:

13

They -- did they address -- I didn't

14

notice that the court had addressed the Michigan rule that

15

said --

16

MR. BUSCH:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BUSCH:

They --- you can't reserve decision.
The rule of the Michigan courts --

19

that is, the Michigan Rules of Criminal Procedure at

20

6.419, I believe it is -- requires that there be some

21

plain statement made, essentially, that there be something

clear.

And that was -- and it is -- our position that the

Or does it apply to

only when the whole trial has been completed?
MR. BUSCH:

It -- it applies when the motion is

made is my understanding.

13

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's not really an answer.

15

If it's just the prosecutor's case and the motion is made,

16

is that covered by the rule, or is it required that both

17

the prosecutor and the defense case be in?

19

MR. BUSCH:

QUESTION:

MR. BUSCH:

It can be made at any time

No.

A motion can be made, but -That is, the motion for a directed

verdict of acquittal.

the answer to this question.

MR. BUSCH:

7

Does that rule apply when the motion is made at

MR. BUSCH:

The rule is 6.419(D), and it's cited

at page 17 of the petitioner's brief.

8

QUESTION:

Is it quoted there too?

9

QUESTION:

What does it say?

10

MR. BUSCH:

It says -- about in the middle of

11

the page in -- in bold, it says, did not substantially

12

comply with the requirements of MCR 6.419(D), and provide

13

that, quote, the court must state orally on the record or

14

in a written ruling made a -- a part of the record its

15

reasons for granting or denying a motion for a directed

16

verdict of acquittal.

17

that rule is that anytime the motion is made, the judge is

18

supposed to make clear the reasons why he's granting a

19

directed verdict.

And my understanding of that is --

20

QUESTION:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

What is --

QUESTION:

But in ordinary trial practice

certainly you -- you can't -- the defense counsel in a

criminal case can't get up after the prosecution has

MR. BUSCH:

I would think the first time

-- after the close of the

That's correct, once the evidence is

presented.
QUESTION:

And what has the rule, as you just

quoted it, got to do with -- with reservation?

In other

10

words, the judge can say, my reasons are A, B, and C, but

11

I'm going to sleep on it, and -- and tomorrow morning I

12

may come up with D and -- and rule the other way.

13

what's that -- what's it got to do with reservation,

14

his -- his reserving his right to change the ruling at a

15

later time?

16

MR. BUSCH:

I mean,

The rights of the judge to change

17

his mind -- our -- our position is, is that he has that

18

right until the jury would be discharged.

19

QUESTION:

Well, does the rule address that?

I

20

mean, Justice Ginsburg asked a question going to

21

reasonableness that depended on what she understood from

22

the -- from the briefs to be a Michigan rule saying the

23

judge can't reserve his right to change his mind later or

24

reserve judgment on the motion when it's made.

QUESTION:

In respondent's brief, it's put in

Now, Mr. Busch, may I make this

suggestion?

It seems to me the rule distinguishes between

motions made after the prosecution has rested and motions

made after the entire case is in.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

It says in the latter case, the judge

can reserve, take his time on it.

17

MR. BUSCH:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
It seems to -- it strikes me, just

19

reading the thing, that the point of the rule is that

20

before the defense goes forward, the defense has a right

21

to know what the ruling is.

22

QUESTION:

That's what I would think.

23

QUESTION:

Now, in this case before the defense

24

went forward, it knew what the ruling was because the

25

judge had come in the next morning and said, okay, I --

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

you know, I've -- I'm going to listen to you again.

2

listened to you again, and -- and, in point of fact,

3

I'm -- I'm not going to grant the motion.

4

enough to satisfy what seems to be the point of the rule,

5

and that is, before a defendant goes forward with a case,

6

he's got to know whether he has to or not?

7

don't -- isn't that a fair way of reading this thing?
MR. BUSCH:

8
9

this case.

I've

And isn't that

Isn't --

Yes, and I think that happened in

This defendant came prepared to try the case

10

on a first degree murder theory, and nothing substantially

11

changed that and he was not prejudiced in any way.
QUESTION:

12

No.

But before he -- before he went

13

forward with his evidence, the judge had changed his mind

14

or come to a further, more final conclusion, however you

15

want to characterize it, so that before he went forward,

16

he knew the judge was saying, no, I'm not throwing out the

17

first degree murder charge.

the rule?

And isn't that enough under

MR. BUSCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. LAMKEN:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's a long-established background principle

15
16

that mid-trial rulings are inherently subject to

17

reconsideration by the trial court itself until the end of

18

trial.

19

promptly seeks reconsideration which necessarily renders

20

the initial ruling inconclusive.

21

important legal and practical considerations.

22

That is especially so where, as here, a party

That rule reflects four

First, trial courts often must rule swiftly

24

deliberation or even a copy of the trial transcript.

reconsideration.
Second, the Double Jeopardy Clause affords the

3

government a full and fair opportunity to make its case in

4

the first tribunal.

5

and fair opportunity includes reconsideration.

6

reconsideration is particularly important precisely

7

because the government very often cannot appeal.

In the context of trial, that full
Indeed,

I guess we never reach your -- your

argument, do we, if we decide this on the 2254 ground.
MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

The Court could -- there are many stopping points short of

12

our argument on which the Court could resolve this --

16

Well, we shouldn't reach your ground

MR. LAMKEN:

Because your ground is a

Well, Your Honor, the Court would

17

have discretion to reach the constitutional ground if it

18

thought it were important enough to resolve the

19

disagreements in the State courts and their -- their

20

rulings that are contrary to --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

I thought we try to avoid deciding

constitutional questions.
MR. LAMKEN:

Yes.

That is -- that is one of the

24

rules the Court follows and it's a general rule, but in

25

important cases, particularly in the qualified immunity

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

context, for example, the Court will -- will sometimes

2

announce the constitutional rule because it's sufficiently

3

important to settle the matter rather than resolving it on

4

statutory grounds or in -- in the context of qualified

5

immunity on reasonableness grounds.
QUESTION:

6

Well, that's sort of a special

7

situation because in those situations you could never get

8

the answer if you always decided it on -- on immunity

9

grounds.

I mean -MR. LAMKEN:

10

Justice Scalia, the Court would

chose, but it would -- certainly would not be required to

do so.

exact same issue in -- on Teague grounds in an earlier

amount of uncertainty.

defendant puts on defendant's case on the assumption first

3

degree is out of the case and then the judge says at the

4

end, oh, sorry, I'm reversing and I'm going to charge.

5

Now, you say the judge can change his mind at any time

6

'til the end of the line.

7

grossly unfair to a defendant.

MR. LAMKEN:

It seems to me that would be

For double jeopardy purposes, but

not for due process purposes.

That would raise a -- raise

10

a -- a serious due -- excuse me -- due process issue.

11

It's the exact same issue that arises, for example, when a

12

trial court dismisses a count of a complaint, which raises

13

no double jeopardy concerns at all and then, very late in

14

the trial, determines that he had erred in dismissing

15

an -- a count of the indictment.

16

ordinary process is either the court must reopen the

17

evidence to permit the defendant to put on the defense

18

that he didn't have the opportunity to present, or the

19

defendant may be entitled to a mistrial.

20

much a fairness trial, due process issue, not a question

21

of double jeopardy.

When that happens, the

reason that escaped the Court and everyone else, directs

an acquittal, what the prosecutor should have done is just

go back to Judge Wyzanski and say, Judge, you made a

mistake here.

4

the hall as you thought, or whatever, and then Judge

5

Wyzanski could have, in fact, taken back the -- the

6

judgment of the directed -- directed verdict of acquittal,

7

although this Court later wouldn't have been able to do it

8

in your view.

9

I haven't been talking to the witness in

MR. LAMKEN:

In our view that's precisely

10

correct, so long as Judge Wyzanski had not discharged the

11

jury because once you discharge the jury, the -- the

12

defendant's right to trial before his tribunal of choice

13

has been eliminated.

correct its own mistakes.

17

the defendant the benefit of acquittal to which no court,

and certainly not the jury and not the trial court that

putatively granted it, believes the defendant is entitled.

2

QUESTION:

Or does that take us somewhat further

than we've gone?
MR. LAMKEN:

3

Well, I think it would -- our best

4

case would probably be this Court's statements in Arizona

5

versus Washington, in essence that the government --

6

although the government often doesn't get an appeal and it

7

doesn't get a second shot at -- bite of the apple, it does

8

get one full and fair opportunity before the trial court.

9

In our view that full and fair opportunity must include

10

reconsideration precisely because trial courts move so

11

swiftly and because the initial decision by a trial court

12

isn't meant to be a final decision but is, in fact, part

13

of the deliberative process, part of the ongoing dialogue

14

in trial among the judge, among a prosecutor and

15

defendant's counsel.
QUESTION:

16

So if you drop the first degree

17

murder charge -- or the judge orders it dismissed and then

18

the defendant testifies thinking, well, at least I'm not

19

going to be tried for first degree, in your view the trial

20

judge can change its ruling and reinstate the first degree

21

murder charges because the defendant shouldn't have

22

relied?

He --

the judge can change his mind, and so he better not take

Alderson Reporting Company

the stand.
MR. LAMKEN:

2

No.

The ordinary rule -- and this

3

is the same rule that applies where a court, for example,

4

dismisses a count of the indictment -- is that defendants

5

are entitled to rely on the interlocutory rulings.

6

they do so to their detriment and to their prejudice and

7

it denies them the opportunity to present their fair

8

defense, that is a significant due process problem and may

Well, it wouldn't be if -- excuse me.

12

QUESTION:

What -- what if you have a series of

13

defendants in a -- in a case and it's being tried, and at

14

the close of the prosecution's evidence, the judge

15

dismisses the indictment as against one of the defendants,

16

but keeps on so the jury is still there?

17

then?

18

later and say, you made a mistake?

19

What happens

Can the -- the prosecution come back a couple days

MR. LAMKEN:

That's, actually points up a

20

difficult question which is whether or not the dismissal

21

of the -- well, if it's dismissal in the indictment, it

22

certainly isn't a double jeopardy problem, but if it's a

23

judgment of acquittal at that point, the question the

24

court would have to confront --

25

QUESTION:

Well, say -- change my hypothetical

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to a judgment of acquittal.
MR. LAMKEN:

2

Right.

That's what I assumed you

3

had meant.

And if that were the case, the court would

4

have to decide whether or not that there -- there's

5

constructively or through legal fiction the discharge of

6

the jury with respect to that defendant even though the

7

actual jury is still there

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LAMKEN:

10

--

But that's -We believe the actual answer would

be --

11

QUESTION:

That's an extraordinary doctrine.

12

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, I -- I would believe that the

13

proper answer would be that if the jury is still

14

available, the prosecution can seek reconsideration.

15

one could say that the jury was constructively discharged

16

with respect to that defendant and thereby preclude the

17

prosecution from seeking reconsideration.

18

critical moment in all of those cases is what constitutes

19

discharge of the jury, the defendant's chosen trier of

20

fact.

21

QUESTION:

But

But getting back to the earlier

point, if a -- if the defendant testifies, thinking

23

there's going to be no first degree charge, and it's later

24

reinstated, under your position I think you would say, he

25

shouldn't have relied.

The rule is that he knows the

his peril.

Therefore, his reliance was at

Well, the Constitution --

I mean, I don't know why you don't

argue -- that's the consequence of your argument it seems.
MR. LAMKEN:

6

Well, certainly the Constitution

7

doesn't require there to be mid-trial rulings on judgments

8

for acquittal.

9

Procedure 29(b) specifically allows -QUESTION:

10
11

In fact, Federal Rule of Criminal

No, but the hypothetical is there is

one.
MR. LAMKEN:

12

Right.

And if the defendant relies

13

to his detriment and it prevents him from presenting a

14

fair defense to which due process entitles him, we believe

15

that he might be entitled to a mistrial.
But we -- nothing of that sort happened here

16
17

because defendant not only was on notice that this -- that

18

the ruling was subject to change, but if you look at the

19

point in the joint appendix, which is the penultimate

20

page, where the court announced -- page 46, where the

21

court announces that it has decided to reconsider, there's

22

no objection from the defense saying, wait a minute, we

23

relied.

24

no statement to that effect.

25

Our whole defense rested on this ruling.

The other party is entitled to rely

MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

I -- I think that just

10

points out the general rule, that -- when a trial court

11

issues a mid-trial ruling, the defendant generally has a

12

right to -- to rely on it, and if he relies on it and it

13

denies him his opportunity to present a fair defense, that

14

presents a serious due process problem.

15

16

concerned with having two trials against the defendant

when the prosecution had its full and fair opportunity in

18

the first.

19

But it is not a

The final problem with the contrary rule is that

20

it requires appellate courts to engage in an often

21

unrealistic endeavor to go through and try and determine

22

what the trial court, through its spontaneous and

23

sometimes extemporaneous statements, really meant to do or

24

what it actually did.

25

to come down to the question of whether the words, my

tentativeness and whether the word okay is the functional

equivalent of it is so ordered.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First of all, a brief factual correction.

The

17

change in the judge's ruling did not occur before

18

Mr. Vincent testified.

19

occurred on April 2nd, 1992, 2 days after the ruling had

20

been made after Mr. Vincent had testified.

21

on April 1st, 1992 was the judge indicated that he would

22

reconsider his motion and hold it in abeyance, but he did

23

not, at that time, take back the directed verdict of

24

acquittal.

25

QUESTION:

The change in the judge's ruling

What happened

Well, he didn't take it back, but he

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

made it clear that he -- he did not consider it -- he did

not consider that he had made a final ruling.

3

that was clear.

4

been made before the testimony occurred.

It was clear that no final ruling had

MR. MORAN:

5

At least

He -- he took the position, Justice

6

Scalia, that he could take back his ruling because he had

7

not informed the jury of it.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MORAN:

10

Right.

Right.

A position that we submit is wrong

under this Court's precedent in Sanabria.
QUESTION:

11

Can I -- can I ask you, do you

12

believe like Justice Breyer that a judge can enter a final

13

order without meaning to enter a final order?
MR. MORAN:

14

What a reviewing court has to do

15

under this precedent in Martin Linen, Justice Scalia, is

16

look at the words and actions of the trial court and

17

decide whether or not it amounts to a ruling.

18

Now, in this case --

19

QUESTION:

And -- and you do that just

20

objectively, and even if there's plenty of evidence that

21

the judge didn't intend it to be a final ruling, if he

22

used certain magic words, it's a final -- it's a final

23

ruling.

24
25

MR. MORAN:

Well, actually, Justice Scalia, it's

petitioner who's arguing for a magic words approach, or

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the Michigan Supreme Court at least.
QUESTION:

2

No.

I -- I don't know who -- who --

3

in whose favor it breaks.

I'm just asking what your

4

position on it is, whether -- whether -- because on

5

that -- on that question hinges whether we are dealing

6

here with a question of fact, as we would be in

7

interpreting -- in -- in deciding, you know, what he

8

intended, or a question of law, as we would be in

9

interpreting the words of a contract where indeed it

10

doesn't matter what the parties intended.

11

themselves this way, you -- you take the objective meaning

12

of it.

13

and not a question of fact for the jury.

14

Right?

If they express

And that's a question of law for the court

MR. MORAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, our position

15

is, is that the trial judge's intent is a relevant fact,

16

but whether or not what he did amounted to an acquittal --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MORAN:

19

QUESTION:

Is a question of law.
-- is a question of law.
Well, in -- in your position here

20

attacking a State judgment, you don't -- you don't

21

immediately get to the constitutional question.

22

to the question of whether the Michigan Supreme Court's

23

ruling was either contrary to our precedents or an

24

unreasonable application of them.

25

Michigan Supreme Court could have been wrong as a matter

You get

In other words, the

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

of abstract constitutional law and it could still be

2

upheld here.

3

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

What we attacked in Federal

4

district court on habeas was the Michigan Supreme Court's

5

conclusion that there had never been an acquittal at all,

6

and we persuaded the Federal district judge and the Sixth

7

Circuit that the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion that

8

there had not been an acquittal was an unreasonable

9

application of this Court's precedents, particularly Ball,

10

Kepner, Green, because the Michigan Supreme Court placed

11

primary emphasis on the absence of formal trappings, and

12

this Court has repeatedly held that even in the absence of

13

any written judgment at all, as in Ball and Kepner, that a

14

final directed -- a verdict of acquittal is final.

15

QUESTION:

It could be, but presumably Michigan

16

knows Michigan law, and if they want to say, under the law

17

of Michigan, the events that took place here do not amount

18

to an acquittal, I guess that's their right.

19

there anything in the cases that you cite which says that

20

Federal law requires Michigan to count these things as an

21

acquittal?

22

MR. MORAN:

Now, is

Well, this Court's precedents,

23

particularly Martin Linen, teach that what the reviewing

24

court is supposed to do is look not to the form of the

25

trial court's ruling but the substance.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, it happens in

2

Michigan they don't do that.

In Michigan, they have the

3

Michigan system.

4

have to, as a matter of Federal law, count this as an

5

acquittal?

6

where the Court has said this is an acquittal, but I don't

7

think they're faced in those cases with a State court that

8

says the contrary.

Now, what is it that tells Michigan you

I quite agree with you that there are cases

9

MR. MORAN:

Well, Smalis, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MORAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

about what the judge had done.

14

found that the State had not proved its case and everybody

15

agreed he had done that, and then the State appealed to

16

the higher courts in Pennsylvania.

Yes.
Smalis came from a State court.
Yes, but in Smalis there was no doubt
I mean, there he expressly

17

MR. MORAN:

That's right.

18

In this case, however, if you look at the full

19

record, the trial judge himself -- and if we get to the

20

issue of intent, Justice Scalia -- the trial judge himself

21

says over and over, I made a ruling, I came to a

22

conclusion, I made a decision, and even at one point, I

23

granted a motion for a directed verdict.

24

position simply as a matter of law, double jeopardy law,

25

Federal double jeopardy law.

QUESTION:

Well, under AEDPA, what is it you

2

think that the Michigan Supreme Court did wrong?

3

to misapply our law, or was it a misapplication of the

4

finding of fact?
MR. MORAN:

6

QUESTION:

MR. MORAN:

the other.

MR. MORAN:

12

QUESTION:

14

Well --- that there had been no --- but AEDPA doesn't say one way or

AEDPA doesn't use the term, legal conclusion.

11

13

It was a -- it was its legal

conclusion --

7

10

Was it

No.

But it --

So what is your answer to my

question?
MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, it matters for

15

AEDPA whether it's law or fact because then we're under

16

(d)(1) or (d)(2).

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MORAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Right.
And so -I'm asking you which one you -- you

want to be under, or perhaps you want to be under both.
MR. MORAN:

Well, it is our position that we win

22

under either because even if it's a finding of fact, it's

23

so unreasonable to say that there was no directed verdict

24

of acquittal here, that we should prevail.

25

QUESTION:

But --

Anyway, the Michigan Supreme Court

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't find the fact against you, did it?

2

as I understand it, it said it really doesn't -- didn't

3

matter to the Michigan Supreme Court.

4

MR. MORAN:

5

QUESTION:

It just -- I --

That's right.
It said even if he had made a ruling,

6

unless -- unless the jury had been advised, it was

7

ineffective for double jeopardy purposes.
MR. MORAN:

8
9

Scalia.

Oh, that's not quite right, Justice

What -- what the Michigan Supreme Court ruled or

10

stated was they agreed with the Michigan Court of Appeals

11

and the dissenters in the Michigan Supreme Court that

12

characterizing the trial judge's comments as an acquittal

13

would require us to reverse Mr. Vincent's conviction.

14

Michigan Supreme Court actually said that.

15

that was after a discussion of Smalis.

The

So they -- and

16

Both the Michigan Court of appeals and the

17

Michigan Supreme Court, after reviewing this Court's

18

decision in Smalis, like so many other lower courts, have

19

come to the conclusion that what a trial judge may not do,

20

consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, is revisit a

21

directed verdict at any point later in the trial.
QUESTION:

22

All right.

Suppose that what he says

23

is, I direct the verdict.

There are two defendants, Smith

24

and Brown, and the judge says, I direct a verdict in favor

25

of Smith.

Oh, my goodness.

I said the wrong thing.

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

Brown.

Okay?

That's what happens.

Constitution then just means that Smith is home free?

Can't try him.

Because?

MR. MORAN:

Are you saying the

And the difference between

No.

The difference between that and

this is that the ruling is not final.

unquestionably final.

MR. MORAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MORAN:

Here the ruling was

The judge --

How?

Why?

I'm sorry?
Why, how?

Explain that.

Because the judge announced his

14

ruling.

All the parties, including the judge, understood

15

that under Michigan court rules, the judge could not

16

reserve his decision, had to make it.

17

announced his decision.

18

QUESTION:

19

He did so.

He said, okay.

He

Is there anything

Reserve means, I take it, that you

20

have to make a decision prior to the -- the defendant

putting on witnesses.

I'm the district judge.

And that, it seems to me, is what the Michigan rule says

8

can't happen in Michigan --

I say I'm going to let it go to

If the jury acquits, you're home free.

If it

That happens all the time.

9

QUESTION:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

Is that -- am I right?

11

MR. MORAN:

The Michigan rule -- I -- I don't --

12

frankly, I don't know because the Michigan rule simply

13

says the judge may not reserve his decision.

14

QUESTION:

But surely it can't mean that if a --

15

if a motion is made at quarter after 4:00 in the afternoon

16

and the court customarily recesses at 4:30, that he can't

17

wait until the next morning, so no testimony being taken

18

in the meantime.

19

MR. MORAN:

In -- in that case that would --

20

that might well be all right because he hasn't made a

21

final decision.

22

The problem here -- we're not --

QUESTION:

Suppose in that case the -- the

23

arguments by the attorneys end at 4 o'clock.

The judge

says, well, I'll let you know my order.

about it.

MR. MORAN:

7

He then comes back at 8:30 in the

That's very similar to Lowe v. State

8

in the Kansas case in which the Kansas Supreme Court,

9

after this Court's decision in Smalis, concluded that a

10

judge couldn't do that even though there had been no

11

intervening proceedings.
QUESTION:

18

The judge had --

What interest is served by such a

rule?
MR. MORAN:

An acquittal is final.

That is the

most fundamental rule of this Court's double jeopardy -QUESTION:
relies on it.

Well, but what -- no one -- no one

No one knew about it.

MR. MORAN:

But, Your Honor, this Court has said

19

over and over again that an acquittal by a judge, in the

20

context of a directed verdict, is equivalent to an

21

acquittal by a jury.

22

QUESTION:

And the same -But he -- he didn't say, I acquit.

23

The judge himself said this at the trial, he said, I

24

didn't enter a directed verdict.

25

MR. MORAN:

I granted a motion.

Yes.

2

QUESTION:

In the judge's own mind, he didn't

acquit.
And what you're urging is so different from how

3
4

we approach trial rulings generally, and the point was

5

made that in a trial, things go fast, judge -- judges make

6

rulings.

7

a ruling and then go home that night, maybe read over the

8

daily transcript, maybe have her law clerk check a few

9

authorities, and say, oh, my goodness, I made a mistake,

It's very common, is it not, for a judge to make

10

the next morning.

You couldn't run trials -- I mean, the

11

trial judges don't have the luxury that appellate judges

12

do in that regard.

13

and they can revisit them.

14

this rule, like no other, is -- once the judge utters the

15

words, motion granted, that's the end of it.

They have to make rulings on the spot,

MR. MORAN:

16

You -- you are suggesting that

I'm not arguing that, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

I am taking the position that if the judge

18

immediately corrects a mistake, as happened in People v.

19

Vilt, a case relied upon by the petitioner, that's

20

different.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what's different between --

22

QUESTION:

Why?

23

QUESTION:

-- saying at 4 o'clock in the

24

afternoon, I grant your motion, and then overnight -- and

25

then they come back the next morning and the judge says,

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I'm not so sure.

Prosecutor, tell me more about this.

2

What's the difference of the overnight interval?

3

has happened.

4

have appeared.

The trial hasn't gone on.

MR. MORAN:

5

Nothing

No witnesses

But, Your Honor, if that was the

6

law, then Smalis v. Pennsylvania is impossible to

7

understand because in Smalis the prosecution there could

8

have taken some sort of emergency appeal to the

9

Pennsylvania Supreme -- Pennsylvania Superior Court, got a

10

ruling late that afternoon, and come back the next morning

11

and resumed the trial.

12

exactly that in a Tenth Circuit case, United States versus

13

Eliason.

14

QUESTION:

And in fact, the prosecution tried

I'm sorry.

I don't follow you

15

because I thought the judge in Smalis was firm throughout,

16

that he never equivocated about what his ruling was.

17

MR. MORAN:

18

to a reconsideration motion --

19

QUESTION:

20

Actually the judge in Smalis agreed

But then he came up just where he was

the first time.

21

MR. MORAN:

Yes, that's -- that's right.

22

What I'm saying is, is that if double jeopardy

23

doesn't protect -- if there's no double jeopardy

24

violation, if it can be revisited quickly, then Smalis is

25

impossible to understand because Smalis then would simply

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

come down to if you can do it quickly, if you can get an

2

appeal to a higher court and a reversal quickly --

3

QUESTION:

Well, being -- being revisited on

4

appeal is different from being revisited at the trial by

5

the trial judge.

6

being drawn by your opponent here.

7

That's -- that's the distinction that's

MR. MORAN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

And -- and the

8

point of that argument is that it makes it completely

9

dispositive as to whether there are other defendants

10
11

remaining, as I believe Mr. Chief Justice -QUESTION:

You don't have to go that far at all.

12

I mean, Smalis is not a case where the judge changed his

13

mind, I take it.

14

changed his mind.

And this is a case where the judge

15

MR. MORAN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
So I'm back to my first question.

The judge says, Smith, you're acquitted.

MR. MORAN:

You're saying that in my case too

There was nothing that -- that was

done to the defendant that the defendant himself did to

his detriment.

MR. MORAN:

QUESTION:

16

MR. MORAN:

We don't know because all we know -Well, have we any reason to believe?
We know that his attorney made

17

decisions on matters such as who is going to go first,

18

will the defendants be present for each other's juries,

19

will witnesses be allowed in the courtroom, a

20

sequestration order.

21

when his client had been acquitted of first degree murder.

22

QUESTION:

He made those decisions at a point

No, but is there any reason to

believe that those decisions would have been different if

24

he had understood that first degree murder was going to be

MR. MORAN:
Souter.

It's a -QUESTION:

3

We simply don't know, Justice

Well, we don't -- we don't know in

4

the sense that there -- there hasn't apparently been

5

specific litigation to that effect, but is there any

6

reason to suspect that the decisions would have been

7

different?

8

to -- to think that there may have been detrimental

9

reliance here?

In other words, is there any reason whatever

10

MR. MORAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes.
Maybe there is, but what -- what is

it then?
MR. MORAN:

13

Yes.

Well, first of all, on those

14

particular decisions, we don't know and it's impossible to

15

reconstruct that at this point.

16

during the overnight recess, Mr. Vincent and his

17

attorney -- as this Court noted in Geders versus the

18

United States, an overnight recess during a trial is a

19

critical time to make crucial decisions -QUESTION:

20

No.

What we do know is that

I -- I realize that, but by the

21

time he departed for the overnight recess, he knew that

22

the judge was going to take the matter up again the next

23

morning.

24
25

The judge had said so.
MR. MORAN:

Mr. Vincent.

that you could not treat with security what the judge had

MR. MORAN:

MR. MORAN:

The rule from the Solicitor

2

General's position would make it completely dispositive as

3

to whether there happened to be other charges remaining,

4

as in Smalis itself, and whether or not there happened to

5

be other defendants.

6

QUESTION:

That's -- that may be true.

That's

7

why I'm nervous about the position.

8

your point of view, unfortunately, lose as long as

9

Michigan was -- was at least within the discretion that

10

Federal law grants them in characterizing what happened

11

here as not an acquittal.

12
13
14

MR. MORAN:

But still, you from

I'm right about that.

If they're correct that it was not

an acquittal.
QUESTION:

Well, not correct.

They -- they have

15

a degree of -- even under the law, that's -- I mean, under

16

the law section too.

17

MR. MORAN:

I agree.

But if you look at the

18

trial judge's comments, he consistently maintains that

19

he -- he made a ruling.

20

word from Martin Linen, that this Court has to decide

21

whether or not the trial judge made a ruling.

22

QUESTION:

And ruling is actually the exact

Mr. Moran, I'd like to get back to an

23

AEDPA question, and that is, as I understand it, there is

24

a division among lower courts on just how much leeway a

25

trial judge has to take back a directed verdict.

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And if

1

there is disarray in the lower courts, how can we say

2

there's clearly established law in your favor?

3

MR. MORAN:

Because what -- what AEDPA requires

4

is not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but

5

to look to see whether the decision of the Michigan

6

Supreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application.

7

Now, I should point out, first of all, on that

8

issue whether a judge can take back a directed verdict,

9

the Michigan Supreme Court did not rule against us, in

10

fact indicated that it agreed with our position that a

11

judge may not take back a directed verdict if he had -- if

12

he has actually rendered one.

13

Appeals ruled the same way.

14

And the Michigan Court of

But if you look at the split of authority, it's
The cases that cite

15

a very striking split of authority.

16

and rely upon Smalis on very similar situations where

17

there is a directed verdict, a partial directed verdict

18

during an ongoing trial, so the trial continues, and then

19

the judge attempts to take back the directed verdict at

20

some point later in the trial, those courts that have

21

applied Smalis have, with one exception, held that the

22

judge cannot do it.

23

way have almost uniformly relied on a Second Circuit

24

decision, United States versus LoRusso, which says that

25

there is no problem with doing that because it does not

Those courts that have gone the other

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

result in a second trial.
And what this Court could not have been more

2
3

clear about in Smalis is that a double jeopardy is

4

violated not only if a reversal of a directed verdict

5

would result in a second trial, but if it would result in

6

a continuation of the same trial.
And that is why this case is constitutionally

7
8

indistinguishable from Smalis.

9

between this case and Smalis is that instead of going to a

10

higher court, as was attempted by -- in the Tenth Circuit

11

in United States versus Ellison, what happened there is

12

that the prosecution -- there was a partial directed

13

verdict, exactly as in this case.

14

across --

15

QUESTION:

The only difference

The prosecution ran

But you -- that's assuming the --

16

assuming the whole factual point at issue here, that there

17

was a partial directed verdict.

18

MR. MORAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes.
And in Smalis, there was no doubt

about that.
MR. MORAN:

Well, there was doubt as to what the

22

judge had done.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it

23

wasn't a directed verdict because it was a legal ruling

24

and not a -- not --

25

QUESTION:

Well, but that -- that was a very

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

theoretical thing, whether as a matter of -- when you're

2

saying there's no evidence as a matter of law, that's a

3

factual ruling or a legal ruling.

4

MR. MORAN:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Yes.
I -- I don't think that bears on our

case.
MR. MORAN:

No, and that is -- and that is a

8

distinction.

That's why we have an issue one, Mr. Chief

9

Justice, is -- is, of course, we have to get past the

10

issue of was there a directed verdict.

11

issue two.

12

take it back?

13

is constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis.

14

Then we get to

If there was a directed verdict, can the judge
And that is where I maintain that this case

On -- on issue one, I -- I just wanted to make a

15

further point about whether this is fact finding or a

16

legal finding.

18

the slightest indication in the Michigan Supreme Court's

19

opinion that it thought it was engaged in fact finding.

20

Nor did this Court think that it was engaged in fact

21

finding in several cases in which this Court has examined

22

arguably ambiguous district court transcripts to determine

23

whether or not an acquittal had been granted, for example,

24

Scott and even more clearly, Sanabria.

25

The Michigan Supreme Court itself did not
There was not

In Sanabria, this Court had to wade through a

difficult record to determine whether or not the district

2

court had, in fact, granted a directed verdict on both

theories, numbers theory and horse betting theory.

QUESTION:

Well, let me follow up on an earlier

5

question of Justice Breyer's.

6

is true under the Federal system that it was a directed

7

verdict, it must therefore be true under the -- under

8

an -- under any State system?
MR. MORAN:

9

Yes.

Do you think that if this

I believe that follows

10

immediately, well, first of all, from Maryland v. Benton

11

which applies Double Jeopardy Clause to the States, but

12

also from Crist -QUESTION:

13

Well, but the fact that -- that that

14

case applies double jeopardy to the States I don't think

15

necessarily settles whether a particular State procedure

16

is or is not a directed verdict.
MR. MORAN:

17

No.

But it also follows from

18

Crist v. Bretz in which this Court rejected a -- Montana's

19

attempt to declare that jeopardy doesn't attach until the

20

first witness is sworn in a jury trial.

21

said, no.

22

is a matter of Federal constitutional law, and it

23

concluded, therefore, that Montana must follow the Federal

24

rule to that point which is that jeopardy attaches when

25

the jury is sworn.

And this Court

Where -- where jeopardy attaches and terminates

And so this Court has consistently

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

applied the same principles about jeopardy-attaching and

2

jeopardy-terminating events whether the cases arise in

3

State or Federal court.
QUESTION:

4

Well, so the Federal rule is that it

5

attaches when there's been a directed verdict, but it's up

6

to State law when -- when there's been a directed verdict.

I mean --

MR. MORAN:

QUESTION:

10

Your Honor, I find that --- there's nothing incompatible

there.
MR. MORAN:

11

Justice Scalia, I find that hard to

12

square with Martin Linen which teaches us that what a

13

reviewing court must do is putting aside form, looking at

14

substance to decide whether the trial court has found an

15

essential element of the offense is missing.

16

the trial judge clearly stated that there is no

17

premeditation been shown, that therefore second degree

18

murder is the appropriate charge, that a docket entry that

19

could not have been more clear was made to that effect on

20

that day, March 31st, 1992, and then followed by at least

21

five statements by the trial judge over the next 2 days

22

explaining that he had made a ruling, that he had directed

23

a verdict, come to a conclusion and made a decision -QUESTION:

He says, I granted a motion, but I didn't direct

MR. MORAN:

Excuse me, Justice Ginsburg.

You're

quite correct.

told, there was a distinction between granting a motion

8

and directing a verdict.

And his distinction was clearly one of

He clearly believed that so long as the jury was not

9

And that position is untenable after Sanabria

10

versus United States and also Martin Linen where the --

11

the United States made the same argument in Martin Linen,

12

that as long as it's the judge after the hung jury

13

declaring a -- an acquittal, if it doesn't involve the

14

jury in some way, it doesn't count.

15

apparently made in Sanabria and dismissed in a footnote

16

that it was so obviously -- so obviously contrary to

17

Martin Linen.

18

The same argument was

And so the judge never said as a fact -- as a

19

fact -- I did not find absence of premeditation.

20

clearly found absence of premeditation, consistently

21

admitted that that's what he had done, but simply

22

believed, as a matter of double jeopardy law, wrong as a

that decision.

That standard was met here.

sort of formality that they were looking for but then

MR. MORAN:

An appeal to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BUSCH:

13

The respondent here has stated that the Michigan

14

Supreme Court agrees with his position with respect to the

15

second prong of AEDPA.

reference to the fact that it was actually not reaching

18

the conclusion.

whether the judge could change his mind.

Thank you, Your Honor.

In fact, the Michigan Supreme

It wasn't reaching a decision as to

The respondent's position essentially requires

21

the people to forfeit the second prong of AEDPA.

22

the Court was wrong on its factual finding or

23

unreasonable, the result of this case must be viewed

24

within the filter of that statute which says that the law

that they applied was reasonable.
