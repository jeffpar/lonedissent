ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART

10
11
12

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Coal Act states that the Commissioner of

13

Social Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign

14

each beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related

15

person that remains in business.

16

understood, in light of this Court's precedents,

17

establishes the deadline that is mandatory but not

18

jurisdictional.

19

the power or the obligation to complete the assignments

20

after that date, if necessary.

21

That provision

It does not deprive the commissioner of

That understanding comports with the text and

22

structure of the Coal Act, as well as with -- with one of

23

its central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible,

24

each coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal

25

operator that actually employed that miner or a related

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

person.
QUESTION:

But that's not true.

In fact, if

3

later research has showed that somebody should have been

4

assigned somewhere else, you -- you don't shift the

5

beneficiaries.

6

is designed to assure a perfect system in which somebody

7

who is responsible, no matter that a mistake was made in

8

the past, in the future that person will be reassigned the

9

way he should be.

10

It -- it isn't the case that -- that this

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the statute does provide

11

for administrative review of assignment so that a coal

12

operator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge

13

that before the commissioner, and if the commissioner

14

found that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could

15

be assigned to a -- a more appropriate coal operator.

16

In addition, the regulations promulgated by the

17

commissioner for the administrative review process allowed

18

the commissioner herself to reopen an assignment if she

19

found that it had been erroneous within a 1-year period.

20

QUESTION:

What happens to someone who wasn't

21

assigned before October 1st?

22

left out in the cold, are they?

23

MS. McDOWELL:

No.

They're -- they're not just

Congress did provide a

24

fallback position for all of those who weren't assigned by

25

October 1st or -- or at any time because they had no

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

former employer or related person who remained in

2

business, and that is, that they will be treated as part

3

of the unassigned beneficiary pool.

4

those miners are paid from an appropriation from the AML

5

Fund, a fund originally created to ameliorate the problems

6

of abandoned mines, and if that fund proves insufficient,

7

the funds will come from a -- a premium imposed on all of

8

the coal operators to whom beneficiaries who have been

9

assigned.

10

QUESTION:

The benefits for

Ms. McDowell, there -- there is a

11

section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment

12

of unassigned premiums.

13

assigned miner and the operator goes out of business in

14

any given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of

15

the pool.

16

initial assignment was before the October 1 deadline or

17

not.

18

to work somewhat against your interpretation.

19

And it says that if there's an

And it doesn't matter really whether the

They just go into the pool in time.

MS. McDOWELL:

And that seems

I think the situation addressed

20

in that provision is quite different, even assuming that

21

it unequivocally establishes that the commissioner

22

couldn't reassign somebody after a company went into

23

bankruptcy.

24

the sorts of assignments that we're concerned with here,

25

are quite different from an assignment after bankruptcy

But assignments at the outset of the process,

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that could occur 20, 30, or 40 years down the road, and

2

Congress may well have been interested only in achieving a

3

correct initial assignment at the outset and not with

4

continuing to readjust the assignments -QUESTION:

5

Well, it does show at least that

6

much, that Congress didn't want to continue perpetually to

7

adjust these things for the -MS. McDOWELL:

8
9

Yes, that's correct.

But the

fact that the -- that Congress directed that the

10

applicable percentage for calculating the assigned

11

beneficiary premium shall be adjusted in certain

12

circumstances doesn't suggest to us that Congress would

13

not have permitted it to be adjust in other -- adjusted in

14

other circumstances as well that Congress may not have

15

explicitly contemplated at the time that the Coal Act was

16

enacted.

One of those was the fact that -QUESTION:

17

Is it possible that that deadline was

18

some kind of political compromise, so to speak, at the

19

time it was passed and the operators thought, well, that's

20

it?

21

You know, after that deadline, it's fixed.
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, there's -- there's no

22

indication in the text or legislative history that that

23

was contemplated.

24

legislating in light of this Court's opinions in Pierce

25

County and Montalvo-Murillo, the provision could not

And indeed, since Congress was

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

readily be understood as providing coal operators with

2

that sort of assurance.

3

In addition --

4

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you say Congress is

5

legislating in light of our decision in Pierce County.

6

You're -- you're just applying the general presumption

7

that Congress does that?

8

any indication here that Congress was legislating in light

9

of Pierce County?
MS. McDOWELL:

10

Certainly there's -- is there

Congress didn't explicitly say

11

so, no, but as, we have cited a number of statutes in our

12

briefs that made clear that when Congress wants to

13

terminate an agency's authority to make decisions at a

14

particular point, Congress knows how to say so explicitly

15

and it has done so in those situations.

16

so here.

17

QUESTION:

It has not done

Well, this is -- this is quite

18

different than Pierce County, though, at least certainly

19

on its facts.

20

you're supposed to ferret out some sort of

21

misappropriations and saying that the inspector general,

22

whoever it was, was supposed to do it in 4 months.

23

simply a message to the agency to get going.

24

think we said quite properly that didn't mean that you

25

couldn't ferret out this sort of thing after the 4 months.

There you had a provision that the --

That's

And we -- I

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But this thing has -- has somewhat different

2

ramifications, I think.

3

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, I think it's clear that

4

Congress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but

5

other deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get

6

the new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into

7

place.

8

promptly so that the Combined Fund could then send bills

9

for premiums to assigned operators.

Congress wanted the assignments to be made

But it wasn't essential to that scheme that

10
11

every last assignment was made by October 1st, and there's

12

no indication that Congress adopted the deadline in order

13

to provide any sort of certainty to coal operators.

14

paraphrase the Court's decision in James Daniel Good, it

15

would seem somewhat curious that a deadline that was

16

intended to expedite the collection of premiums by the

17

Combined Fund could be construed to prevent the Combined

18

Fund in some circumstances from collecting premiums at

19

all.

And that's the effect of -QUESTION:

20
21

your interpretation?

22

ever?

23

To

Is there any limiting principle to
I mean, can this go on forever and

MS. McDOWELL:

Oh, the statute doesn't itself

24

impose a limit on the commissioner's authority.

However,

25

as a practical matter, the commissioner has not made

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

initial assignments for more than 5 years now and has no

2

intent to recommence them.

3

off the authority to do this at -- at any particular time

4

by denying an appropriation for the process or by doing it

5

explicitly.
QUESTION:

6

Obviously, Congress can cut

Would you tell us what percentage of

7

the assignments were made after the deadline, and how long

8

after the deadline was the most recent assignment?
MS. McDOWELL:

9
10

Yes.

The -- to answer your last

question first, the last one was made in 1997.
Congress made a total of approximately --

11
12

rather, the commissioner made a total of approximately

13

40,000 assignments before the deadline, in addition to

14

another 15,000, approximately, assignments that the coal

15

operators had agreed to.
After the deadline, the commissioner made 10,000

16
17

more assignments.

18

1993 or a handful in February 1994.

19

primarily in 1995 and 1996 and a few more, about 55, in

20

1997.

21

A quarter of those were made in October
The rest were made

And the process has been completed.
QUESTION:

When there is a reassignment or

22

taking somebody out of the unassigned pool and attributing

23

that person to an operator, does the operator who has now

24

gotten the assignment have to pay interest for the period

25

from October '93 on, or is it just that you pay now the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bill that we would have sent you if we had charged you in

2

'93?
MS. McDOWELL:

3
4

charged.

The latter.

There's no interest

So to the extent --

5

QUESTION:

So that the --

6

MS. McDOWELL:

-- the operator benefits by

7

having the use of the money during the period before the

8

obligation is imposed.

9

QUESTION:

What about the argument that the

10

Social Security Administration stood before Congress and

11

said, we can make this date?

12

be saddled with additional responsibility could breathe

13

easily and say, well, we don't have to set up any reserve

14

for the assignment of more operators to us.

15

MS. McDOWELL:

Then the operators who might

Well, in fact, Your Honor, the

16

commissioner didn't say we will make the deadline.

17

commissioner did express optimism in September of 1993

18

that the deadline could be complied with.

19

QUESTION:

The

I thought there were quotations in

20

the record that had an official from the Social Security

21

Administration telling Congress we are going to do it.

22

was more than, it's a hope.

23

fingertips now.

24
25

MS. McDOWELL:

It

I -- I don't have that at my

I think it could have been only

an expression of hope in -- in September 1993, and then

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the operators would have received, in many cases, and --

2

and these respondents certainly did -- assignments of

3

additional beneficiaries during October 1993, so that

4

should have put them on notice to make inquiry as to

5

precisely when the assignment had been made.

6

I think a particularly more telling and -- and

7

earlier statement from a -- an acting commissioner came in

8

February 1993 when the acting commissioner was testifying

9

before a House appropriations subcommittee.

He said at

10

that point that it did not appear that the assignments

11

could be completed by the deadline.

12

One Member of Congress asked, well, what is the

13

-- the crucial date, then?

14

will lose benefits if the assignments aren't made?

15

the acting commissioner went on to explain that, well,

16

because there was a -- a $70 million transfer coming into

17

the Combined Fund on October 1st, 1993 from the United

18

Mine Workers 1950 pension fund, there would be money in

19

the Combined Fund for some time to pay benefits, and that

20

the assignments could be done on a rolling basis to bring

21

money into the fund.

22

point that there was no jurisdictional cutoff of the time

23

to make assignments contemplated by the statute.

24
25

QUESTION:

When is it that beneficiaries
And

So it was clearly understood at that

Ms. McDowell, what do you do with the

provision of 9704(a)(3)(D) which makes an assigned

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

operator's unassigned beneficiaries' premium equal to the

2

operator's applicable percentage, which is defined as its

3

percentage of total assigned beneficiaries, quote,

4

"determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,

5

1993"?
MS. McDOWELL:

6

The statute then goes on to

7

provide for adjustments in years after 1993 for two

8

circumstances:

9

the administrative review process, and when a change has

when a change has been made as a result of

10

been made as a result of coal operators going out of

11

business.

12

QUESTION:

Right, but -- but --

13

MS. McDOWELL:

14

QUESTION:

And the fact that Congress --

-- but does not make a third

15

exception; that is, a change is made as a result of the --

16

the finding of additional assigned beneficiaries under the

17

-- under the commissioner's ability to -- to find it after

18

October 1.

19

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

20

the fact that Congress said that these adjustments shall

21

be made doesn't suggest that Congress did not intend to

22

permit other appropriate adjustments to be made as well.

23

QUESTION:

No, but what does -- what does

24

suggest that is the language, determined on the basis of

25

assignments as of October 1, 1993.

And then there's no

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

provision for -- elsewhere that would enable you to -- to

2

make the other adjustment.
MS. McDOWELL:

3

Well, Congress was obviously

4

contemplating, at the point that it enacted the statute,

5

that the deadline would be made, satisfied.

6

it's therefore somewhat understandable that Congress

7

didn't discuss all the permutations of what would happen

8

if -- if the deadline was, in fact, not satisfied.

So it's --

And an additional point is even if one assumed

9
10

that the unassigned beneficiary premium, the applicable

11

percentage used to calculate it had to remain fixed as of

12

October 1st, 1993, that doesn't really address the

13

commissioner's assignment authority after that date, and

14

it is not essential to the statute --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, no, it isn't essential but it

QUESTION:

It has to because then you'd be

makes --

18

paying more than your share.

19

assumption that you only had X number of -- of permanent

20

beneficiaries, but then your -- you'd be paying that

21

premium, but then you have additional beneficiaries that

22

you must take care of on their own account because they're

23

assigned to you.

24

-- if you can't change the formula.

25

You'd be paying based on the

So you -- so you are hurt if you can't

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, I'm not sure that it would

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

significantly change the -- the percentage of the whole

2

that the operator would be required to pay for.

3

But in any event, in practice the Combined Fund

4

has gone back and taken subsequent assignments, just like

5

subsequent reassignments, into account in calculating the

6

applicable percentage, and the statutory scheme has worked

7

quite satisfactorily in that respect.

8
9

QUESTION:

Would you clarify one thing for me?

I don't know whether the -- the fallback position to

10

finance the unassigned -- the benefits for the unassigned

11

miners -- they -- there are two -- some money comes out of

12

the first pension fund.

13

Government fund.

14

that that money may run out and the miners will be

15

assessed for the payment -- for the unassigned -- the

16

companies will be assessed for the payments for the

17

unassigned miners.

18

Later it comes out of a

And then there's the third possibility

Now, what is the Government's position with

19

respect to a company that, say, had nobody assigned prior

20

to the October date, but after the October date, say, 500

21

miners were assigned?

22

would mean the -- that company would have no

23

responsibility to contribute to the payments for the

24

unassigned miners.

25

adjust it based on post-October assignments?

Now, as I read the statute, that

Am I right about that?

Or would you

1

MS. McDOWELL:

I'm not aware of any company in

2

that situation, but I think it would be adjusted for post-

3

October assignments as well.
QUESTION:

4
5

Despite the language of the statute

that Justice Scalia referred to.
MS. McDOWELL:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

We think it's

7

flexible enough to allow those additional adjustments to

8

be taken into account.
QUESTION:

9

When do you do the adjusting in the

10

11

actually make the adjustments?
MS. McDOWELL:

12

That's a task that's left to the

13

Combined Fund to do.

QUESTION:

with a -- or at least liable to be socked with an

21

assignment for which they had no reason to plan on October

23

MS. McDOWELL:

You know, I think the

24

commissioner typically made one round of assignments a

25

year during the time --

Sometimes two rounds, I believe.

And is that made in advance of

effective as of October 1 each year?
MS. McDOWELL:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

I still don't see your basis for

doing it.

13

confronted with language that says it will be determined

on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993.

15

mean, there it is.

There is no -- no exception elsewhere to do what you say

there's flexibility to do.

flexibility from?

19

You say it's flexible enough, but you're

I

It says it in cold, hard language.

MS. McDOWELL:

Where do you get the

Well, Congress didn't foreclose

20

additional adjustments to be assigned beneficiary premium

21

in addition to those specified in the statute.

22

QUESTION:

What do you mean it didn't foreclose?

23

Yes, it did.

It said, determined on the basis of

24

assignments as of October 1, 19 -- what -- what more does

25

it have to say?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, then if you will turn to

2

the next subsection of the statute, it provides for

3

adjustments for plan years after 1993.
QUESTION:

4

For other -- exactly.

That -- that

5

makes it even clearer that except for those expressed

6

exceptions, everything else has to be done as of October

7

1.

8
9

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, in any event, Your Honor,

that particular provision is a separate section of the

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

complete its work on time.

They should not get it.

It is conceded in this case that the

2

beneficiaries at issue were supposed to be assigned to

3

Bellaire and Peabody.
It's conceded that these respondents are not

4
5

being asked to pay a penny more than Congress wanted them

6

to pay.
It's conceded that Congress wanted as many

beneficiaries as possible to be assigned to particular

9

operators.

10

Section 9706(a) itself directs SSA to assign

each beneficiary.

Now --

11

Counsel, would you explain to us the

12

real world consequences at the end of the day for the

13

respective positions of the parties?

14

MR. BUSCEMI:

15

Apparently the

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

respondents make a great deal of that as if the only

17

purpose of the statute was to ensure that the

18

beneficiaries would continue to receive their health

coverage.

That was surely a major percentage.

Yes.

also -- is the fund will always have adequate funds to pay

MR. BUSCEMI:

QUESTION:

The plans.

Well, the Combined Fund will --

The -- the plans in that sense aren't

4

hurt because they're -- they're not going to run out of

5

money.

6

MR. BUSCEMI:

The Combined Fund will receive

7

funds in accordance with the provisions of the statute.

8

The answer to Justice O'Connor's question is threefold.

9

It is complicated.

10

For the first 3 plan years, beginning February

11

1, 1993 and ending October 1 -- I'm sorry -- September 30,

12

1995, if these beneficiaries are not assigned, as they

13

should be, to Bellaire and Peabody, all of the other

14

assigned operators will receive a greater assessment, and

15

they will -- because there will be an increased number of

16

unassigned beneficiaries during those first 3 plan years.

MR. BUSCEMI:

understand it, or am I wrong about that?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, they -- they surely are

23

complaining.

The Apogee case, for example, in the

24

Eleventh Circuit was a case that arose precisely because

25

of that sort of supplemental, after-the-fact assessment

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

designed to take into account the fact that there was a

2

greater number of unassigned beneficiaries in the plan.

3

And that, in particular, arose as a result of this Court's

4

decision in the Eastern Enterprises case.

5

MR. BUSCEMI:

Congress says that there shall be annual transfers from

of the statute was to have the greatest possible amount

who had received assignments, initial assignments of

beneficiaries that were made after September 30, 1993.

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The petitioners' position is that when Congress

8

said shall before October 1st, 1993, it meant may before

9

or after October 1st, 1993.

That is so, according to the

10

petitioners because, as they read the statute, Congress

11

could not really have intended to limit the authority of

12

the commissioner to make assignments under the act.

13

But there is nothing implausible or even unusual

14

about reading the statute to mean what it says.

It's a

you agree -- I think we both agree there are many statutes

with deadlines in them.

set, health regulations by such and such a date set,

18

consumer, trucking regulations.

19

set that those dates, even though they use words like

20

shall, are not fixed because obviously Congress wanted the

21

regulations written, even if late.

22

There are regulatory statutes

And the courts regularly

Well, here they're saying this is roughly the

23

same thing.

Obviously, Congress would have wanted this

assigned in the principle of pay for your own way, and

25

nobody is hurt by doing that late.

Nobody is really hurt.

Now, I want you to reply to that.

What's the

2

down side of trying to interpret this like we'd interpret

3

other regulatory statutes?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well -- well, it's not like the

5

other regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an

6

extraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive

7

liability.

8

same sentence that says shall.

9

different than saying, EPA, in 2 years issue clean air

The grant exists nowhere other than in the

11

Pierce County is quite different.

probably has inherent authority to recover misspent funds.

13

That's -- that's a different case.

And

I think the Government

The harm is the same harm that comes from

14

disregarding any kind of deadline.

15

sort of project you can spend 20 years on and always come

16

up with a more perfect assignment.

17

They knew that a significant amount of work was involved.

18

They had to go and set up an interim funding system for

19

February to October to give the commissioner time.

That is -- how?

MR. ROBERTS:

Imagine they got the

Oh, sure.

Well, it's the same

6

concern the Court noted last term in the Sigmon Coal case.

7

The coal industry is characterized by a significant amount

8

of transactions, mergers, acquisitions.

9

looking at acquiring a coal company, and of course, given

10

the nature of the industry, the first question you ask is

11

what is your liability, and they're going to say, well,

12

it's this much.

13

the acquisition takes place, and then you get another

14

notice, here are, you know, 40 new miners.

15

of a sudden, it's this much.

17

instance as well.

You could be

you are, in fact your companies are paying less than they

would have paid had they been billed properly on time

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think interest is a

3

significant factor just the way the interest rates have

4

been over this time period.

5

to cushion the unfairness and inequity of getting a bill

6

retroactive as much as 5 years.

7

QUESTION:

It certainly doesn't do much

But my -- my point is simply had you

8

gotten that bill, that -- timely, it would have been more

9

costly than getting the bill later because you have had

10
11

the use of the money in the interim.
MR. ROBERTS:

12

not -- not charged.

13

QUESTION:

The -- the interest is apparently

Unless you're -- unless you're a

14

company that had bought a company which, which had that

17

it's less money than -- than would have been charged

such transactions play in this particular industry may

Again, Congress cushioned the unfairness;

recognized it by making the AML Fund available.
Second of all, this is a statute that is

7

suffused with concepts of rough justice.

It is not

8

necessarily a more perfect result to pursue 5 years

9

instead of 1 year to pay for your own principle.

That

10

does not necessarily lead to a more perfect result.

11

may mean that more companies who employed miners for 2

12

years are paying over all of those benefits than companies

13

-- when companies who employed the same miner for 20 years

14

don't have to pay for any.

15

That's right.

So -- so you -- you admit that that

language doesn't really mean what it says.
MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, no.

It means as of October

What I'm saying, in the case of a reassignment, they

say you can go back and -- and reassign it.

your argument that the equitable structure of the statute

2

is enhanced because the commissioner didn't get his work

done on time.
MR. ROBERTS:

4

Well, I think the commissioner did

5

get the work done on time.

It's just she just wants to do

6

a more perfect job.

7

reasonable for Congress to determine we don't need the

And what I'm saying is it's

We need a good-enough job.

The one thing that's clear is that the way the

after October 1st, '93?
MR. ROBERTS:

3

I think we know it primarily --

4

no.

There's no statement like that.

I think we know it

from the structure of the statute which is carefully

reticulated.

There is no delegation of discretion to the

And when you talk about revisiting fairness,

keep in mind you're looking at one particular provision

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:
I'd like to start with a legal point, and I want

4
5

to start by looking at 9706(a), which I'm sure you have

6

handy.

7

from the red brief, Bellaire's brief, at A19.

8

the assignment provision we've been discussing.

9

are two things that are important about the language of

10

I'm going to -- 9706(a).

I'm going to be reading
And this is
And there

9706(a).
The first is, of course, that it says, shall

But the second point is that it's the same shall

Well, that's an important question.

But ultimately, it's robbing Peter to pay Peter.

these funds, at the end of the day, came from coal

companies.
QUESTION:

So I

would appreciate why they aren't -- I mean, Mr. Roberts

brought that up.

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

10

Because of the cushion.

And I'm just curious why they're not

here.
MR. SUTTON:

11

The cushion, Your Honor.

The

12

cushion.

A critical part of the compromise that led to

13

the enactment of the act was a cushion of funds to provide

14

for the benefits of unassigned beneficiaries.

15

cushion has been sufficient.

16

there's not been a concern yet for this pro rata -QUESTION:

21

pay for the unassigned miners?

22

It's been sufficient up to

But isn't it assumed that in time that they will

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, the Government all the

23

time relies on much less reliable proxies than this one.

24

Keep in mind that 93 to 94 percent of these miners'

25

records were reviewed.

The risk that somehow this pro

that could happen given the numbers -QUESTION:

I can't imagine how

Well, do you not agree -- I'm not

5

sure you're responding to my question.

6

that there is a significant possibility, even a

7

likelihood, that you'll reach the third stage of financing

8

for the unassigned pool?
MR. SUTTON:

9

Do you not agree

I don't know, and the reason I

10

don't know is that you -- these AML transfers have done

11

the job.

12

Since 1995 they have done the job, and this is a

Where would that money go?

QUESTION:

Assume there is a significant risk.

QUESTION:

But they haven't eliminated the

16

unassigned pool.

17

MR. SUTTON:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

No, they haven't.

Of course, not.

And the question is who -- who should

pay for those?
MR. SUTTON:

And the rough justice calculation

21

that the Congress made is we're going to do it on a pro

22

rata basis.

23

think this, I hope, puts the 1992 decision in context.

25

If I could just step back for one second, I

Through -- from 1946 forward, they paid for
these benefits in two ways.

One was pay for your own.

The employer paid for his or her employee.

one was pay as a group.

Suppose the Secretary had gotten

around to only half instead of what it was.

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

9

And the second

Right.

You're saying she couldn't -- she --

she should not have tried to make it perfect.

It was good

10

enough for Government work.

But suppose it was only --

11

she -- she was much slower and she only did, say, one-

12

third.

Then what?

13

MR. SUTTON:

There's -- there's -- I'm sorry.

14

There's clearly some point at which the wheels

15

of the statute would fall off, but I think from the

16

Court's perspective of construing what the statute means,

17

it's appropriate to assume the commissioner is going to

18

act in good faith.

19

20

QUESTION:

She did act in good faith.

She did

When you say it would fall off, do

21

you mean that in that event, if she had been slower than

22

she was, then she would have been permitted to make

23

assignments after the deadline?

MR. SUTTON:

saying that.

No, Your Honor, I don't mean to be

QUESTION:

Well, what would have happened?

2

Let's say she did only one-third of the job and you had

3

this large pool of unassigned people.

MR. SUTTON:

Well, the bigger problem would have

been the assigned miners and they wouldn't have had enough

money to pay for them.

they've got a very serious problem on their hands because

to pay for their benefits.

QUESTION:

The first

And if they hadn't

You'd be back --

I thought the first 3 years they got

15

the money from the pension fund.

16

MR. SUTTON:

Those were used primarily for

17

unassigned.

18

but most were used to pay for unassigned benefits.

19

that's the point I'm making there.

20

They were used some to help with assigned,
So

I'd like to make a point about Pierce County

21

that I think is helpful in thinking about deadline cases

22

in general.

23

statute says you must complete this FOIA request in 20

24

days, our -- our case would control it.

25

as in that situation, these governmental agencies have

Here's why we're not saying that when a

There are general

There was one in Pierce County.

If you look at

Here -- and so what Pierce County means is we're

7

not going to say there's a repeal by implication of that

8

general grant of authority merely because we now have

9

another statute that says do it quickly, get it done.

10
11

That's not this case.
9706(a) is the only provision either petitioner

12

has pointed to that gives you this grant of authority.

13

the grant comes with a limit.

QUESTION:

So

May I just interrupt with -- with one

argument that Justice Scalia identified, Mr. Buscemi gave

MR. SUTTON:

Oh, I'm sorry.

The other shall -- I'm sorry.

The other shalls throughout this statute --

5

you've got two different issues there.

One of them is

6

that they apply -- there's no contingency plan if you

miss.

8

inference.

Here we've got a contingency plan.

That's one

The second is they all regulate private

entities.

11

Pierce County.

12

by this date, they don't do it, a court clearly has

13

authority to say, we said do it by this date, do it.

14

had -- they had -- you don't have a authority problem with

15

a private entity.

16

This goes back to the point I just made about
If a private entity is told do something

They

They can do what they want.

With the Government, however, and particularly

17

when it comes to these extraordinary retroactive

18

assignments of liability, the commissioner is not born

19

with that authority.

20

Government to turn square corners in that kind of a

21

setting as opposed to a setting where they're merely

22

exercising a general power to get misspent Federal funds,

23

fulfill a FOIA request.

24
25

QUESTION:

It's not inappropriate to ask the

There --

Mr. Sutton, I -- I thought that or

maybe I just hoped that Justice Stevens was -- was asking

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about why it is that the -- the crucial language

2

determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,

3

1993 is in fact not so crucial, that -- that as Mr.

4

Buscemi said, there are other instances in which something

5

was not determined before October 1, 1993, but

6

nonetheless, it is deemed to have been determined before

7

October 1, 1993.
MR. SUTTON:

8
9

By the statute.

It says that if

they -- if a company goes out of a -- goes into

10

bankruptcy, we're going to alter the applicable percentage

11

as of October 1st, 1993 because they went into bankruptcy.

12

If there's a reassignment, it goes back to October 1st.
QUESTION:

13

Well, does the statute say it goes

14

back to October 1st?

Does the statute say the

15

reassignment shall be deemed to have been made as of

16

October 1?
MR. SUTTON:

17

Let's go back to it right here.

18

You've got -- in the provision you're talking about,

19

9704(f), the applicable percentage, it has the general

20

rule.

QUESTION:

MR. SUTTON:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SUTTON:

25

Where is that?

What page?

A13 of the appendix.

Okay.
The general rule is stated in

9704(f) and then you have the adjustments to the general

rule.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. SUTTON:

And then it says, look at number 2:

4

by making the following changes to the assignments as of

5

October 1st, 1993.

6

they understood what was going on, and that's -- that's

7

what's so inappropriate here.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SUTTON:

They -- they stuck with it.

I mean,

Okay.
I mean, Justice Ginsburg, you made

10

the point that there's no interest running on this, but

11

keep in mind we don't get interest when they make mistakes

12

on our assignments.

13

they mistakenly assign someone to us, we don't get

14

interest there.

That's a wash.

Right?

I mean, if

But -- thank you, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART

19

MS. McDOWELL:

Justice Breyer asked why there

20

weren't coal companies on our side of the courtroom.

It's

21

because we, that is, the Federal Government, has been

22

paying through the AML Fund for the benefits for the last

23

few years.

24

interest is going to run out, and at that point, there

25

will be coal operators who will be bearing a larger burden
