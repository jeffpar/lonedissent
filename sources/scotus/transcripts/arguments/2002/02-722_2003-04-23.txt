ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GELLER:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

11

58 years ago almost to the day the United States

12

and its allies defeated Nazi Germany and World War II came

13

to an end in Europe.

14

States Government has been actively engaged in a series of

15

initiatives to obtain just compensation for victims of the

16

war.

17

Ever since that time, the United

These efforts continue to the present day.
Beginning in the mid-1990s, the Federal

18

Government has been engaged in extensive negotiations with

19

other Governments concerning claims of Holocaust victims.

20

The President himself has stated repeatedly that it's in

21

the foreign policy interests of the United States to have

22

these claims resolved exclusively in an international

23

forum and through nonadversarial means, rather than

24

through costly, time-consuming and contentious litigation.

25

To achieve these goals in the context of unpaid

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

insurance claims, the President has taken three actions.

2

First, the United States has facilitated and encouraged

3

the establishment of the International Commission on

4

Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC.
Second, the United States, with the personal

5
6

intervention of the President himself, has negotiated

7

agreements with Germany and Austria under which those

8

countries and their insurance companies agreed to provide

9

hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for unpaid

10

insurance claims and to follow procedures worked out with

11

ICHEIC to process insurance claims in a nonadversarial

12

manner and under relaxed standards of proof, and -QUESTION:

13

Mr. Geller, I -- let me mention a

14

couple of things that I find troubling about the case, and

15

one is that when Congress passed a law in this area it

16

didn't include any language preempting State laws such as

17

California has, and when the President put out his

18

executive order or agreement it doesn't expressly do so,

19

either.

20
21

How does that affect our analysis, do you think?
MR. GELLER:

Well, the statute that Congress

passed was the Holocaust Assets --

22

QUESTION:

Yes, right.

23

MR. GELLER:

-- Commission Act, which clearly

24

gave authority to the President to take control of this

25

issue, and didn't provide any role for the States

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

whatsoever.

2

QUESTION:

But it didn't preclude a role.

3

MR. GELLER:

But in the area of foreign affairs,

4

under this Court's decision in Zschernig, and in the area

5

of foreign commerce under many of this Court's

6

decisions -QUESTION:

7

Well, Zschernig has never been cited

8

since it was written.

9

hang your whole -MR. GELLER:

10
11

It's kind of a troublesome thing to

Our whole case does not depend on

Zschernig -QUESTION:

12

-- case on, and we have in the

13

meantime decided, for instance, Barclay's Bank, which has

14

some language in it that speaks against recognizing the

15

kind of --

16

MR. GELLER:

17

QUESTION:

I don't --

-- authority you talk about, and we

18

have the Breard case, that criminal case, Breard versus

19

Greene.

20

Now, how do we deal with those?
MR. GELLER:

Well, to begin with I think

21

Barclay's is completely distinguishable, Justice O'Connor,

22

on at least three grounds.

23

solely the Foreign Commerce Clause, and the Court said in

24

Barclay's that Congress has primacy under the Foreign

25

Commerce Clause, and it read the record in that case to

First, Barclay's concerns

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

conclude that Congress had acquiesced in or approved what

2

California was trying to do in the area of taxation, so

3

there was no suggestion that what California was trying to

4

do in that case prevented the Federal Government from

5

speaking with one voice in the area of foreign commerce.

6

There's nothing, to begin with, comparable in this case to

7

suggest that Congress has done anything to authorize

8

California to engage in regulation of foreign insurance

9

policies involving foreign companies and foreign

10

beneficiaries.

11

Secondly --

12

QUESTION:

13

But the United States must have been

aware that this California legislation existed.

14

MR. GELLER:

15

QUESTION:

I --

And the -- part of the story is that

16

this State legislation was on the books before the

17

executive agreement with Germany and Austria that you've

18

just applauded, so when California acted there wasn't any

19

such accord.

20

MR. GELLER:

Well, several things, Justice

21

Ginsburg, and then I want to get back to answer Justice

22

O'Connor's question.

23

Federal Holocaust Act was passed before the HVIRA, so it

24

could not in any way be read as acquiescing in or

25

approving anything that California was doing in this area.

First, the Holocaust Act, the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Secondly, and Mr. Kneedler will, I think, speak

2

to this, the executive agreement did not expressly preempt

3

any claims, because these were claims largely by foreign

4

nationals against foreign companies, and the President did

5

not believe it would be appropriate to extinguish all of

6

those claims, but we're not dealing in this case with

7

claims by individuals.

8

State which interfere with what the President himself has

9

said are his goals in an area, a very sensitive area of

10
11

We're dealing with actions by a

foreign affairs.
And this case is not like -- this case is much

12

stronger than Zschernig, because in Zschernig, the Federal

13

Government had done nothing in the area.

14

this Court said that the States cannot enter into an area

15

where it has the potential for embarrassment, or to

16

interfere with the --

17

QUESTION:

18

foreign government.

19
20
21

Nonetheless,

Zschernig involved criticism of a

So does this statute.

This statute

criticizes -QUESTION:

Is that really a sound basis for a

22

decision like Zschernig, to say Oregon probate judges were

23

inquiring about the policies of Eastern European

24

countries?

25

strongly reasoned opinion.

I mean, I -- I don't regard that as a very

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GELLER:

But this case, Chief Justice, is

2

much stronger than Zschernig because this is not a case,

3

unlike Zschernig, where the President has done nothing in

4

the area.

5

the area and tried to impose a solution which he has

6

concluded is in the best interests of the foreign policy

7

of the United States, so it's not a question of field

8

preemption.

9

Here, the President has aggressively entered

Zschernig could be looked at as a case of field

10

preemption.

11

Zschernig is that there is a field of foreign affairs

12

where, even if the United States Government has done

13

nothing, the States cannot enter.

14

think gets much more clearly analogous to conflict

15

preemption.

16

Congress, has aggressively moved to try to solve a very

17

serious international problem, and --

18

What the Court essentially said, I think, in

This is a case that I

Here, the President, with the acquiescence of

QUESTION:

But Mr. Geller, said in that very

19

agreement there is to be no preemption.

20

said that when California law was already on the books.

21

MR. GELLER:

The President

I don't think it specifically says

22

there's to be no preemption.

We're not dealing here, to

23

begin with, Justice Ginsburg, with claims by individuals.

24

We're dealing here with State legislation, and in the

25

executive agreement the President -- the President

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

promised to use his best efforts to prevent the States

2

from interfering with the executive agreement.

3

concluded on many occasions that what California has tried

4

to do here is a direct interference, a direct interference

5

with the foreign policy position of the United States,

6

which is to funnel all of these claims through an

7

international commission.

8
9

QUESTION:

He has

Well, if we can look just at the

agreement, isn't this what is usually called an executory

10

agreement, rather than a -- than a fully executed

11

agreement?

12

recognizing the importance of the objectives of this

13

agreement, shall in a timely manner use its best efforts

14

in a manner it considers appropriate to achieve those

15

objectives.

16

That's not --

In other words, it says the United States,

That's -- that's something yet to be done.

17

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

19
20

No, I think, Justice --

It sounds to me like executory,

rather than fully -MR. GELLER:

I think what the agree -- Just --

21

Mr. Kneedler is probably better equipped to address the

22

meaning of the executive agreement, but it seems to me

23

what -- what the President has chosen to do there is to

24

promise to use his best efforts to look to see whether any

25

States or localities are taking actions which interfere

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

with the promises that the President has made to foreign

2

countries and foreign insurance companies to try to

3

achieve legal peace in the United States, and in those

4

instances where the States have taken action which

5

interferes directly with that -- with that promise, the

6

President has promised to use his best efforts, such as to

7

file briefs in this Court and others, arguing that

8

these -- these State statutes are preemptive, so it's --

9

there's no -- I think in the lingo of a statute there is

10

no express preemption here, but there's clearly implied

11

preemption under the Supremacy Clause.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Geller, I may have misheard you,

13

but didn't you describe the agreement a little more

14

broadly than its terms?

15

understood it, was to funnel all the claims through the --

16

the -- this -- this new body, and I don't understand that

17

producing the information that's sought in this case would

18

preclude that from being done.
MR. GELLER:

The President's agreement, as I

Well, the -- the international

20

commission not only set up a claims resolution process, it

MR. GELLER:

Well, the executive agreement chose

the -- the President chose through the executive agreement

4

and through his negotiations with foreign countries to use

1

MR. GELLER:

-- false, Justice Ginsburg.

It's

2

based on outdated information.

3

that the United States has reached with Germany and

4

Austria, all the insurance companies in those countries

5

have agreed to follow the ICHEIC procedures so that with

6

the inclusion of all the German insurance companies, all

7

the Austrian insurance companies, all the Dutch insurance

companies, and many of the Swiss insurance companies, I

would say that the ICHEIC system now covers at least

does the California statute interfere with the operations

of the commission?

MR. GELLER:

16

different ways, Justice Kennedy.

17

with, because it presents the possibility that these

18

companies will have to pay twice, and it was a specific

promise on the part of the United States that they would

not have to pay twice.

MR. GELLER:

It would be because under the

international commission these companies have already made

a substantial payment, over $100 million, to settle their

continue, it's possible that people will be able to bring

MR. GELLER:

It simply

But the only purpose of the

statute, and this is as clear as can be from the face of

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute, is to provide information so that

2

Californians can bring suit in California, but the second

3

way in which the California statute, Justice Kennedy,

4

interferes with the ICHEIC process is that all of these

5

companies agreed to the ICHEIC process on the assumption

6

that European privacy laws would be respected.

7

that is one of the principal reasons why the United States

8

has negotiated this alternative system.
QUESTION:

9

That's --

Under the --

Mr. Geller, one -- would you explain

10

one thing that is troubling?

11

being asserted, one can understand an insured doesn't want

12

the insurance company to divulge the insured's records,

13

but we are dealing with a unique situation here in that

14

many of these insureds, the insureds that were concerned,

15

were killed in the Holocaust, and it seems to me to raise

16

a privacy interest with respect to those people and their

17

beneficiaries is -- is kind of ironic.
MR. GELLER:

18

The privacy interest that is

But Justice Ginsburg, this is very

19

important.

Under -- we're dealing with tens of millions

20

of insurance policies here.

those policies has to do, have to -- relate to Holocaust

22

victims.

of the intimate details of all 10 million of those

policies, 99.9 percent of which have nothing at all to do

Only a small percentage of

California would require, and this is a critical

9

era that are on electric data base are to be -- are to be

census of all of the possible Holocaust victims in Germany

I take it you could make that

MR. GELLER:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

What

California has tried to do here would violate the foreign

affairs power as well as the Commerce Clause, even absent

For California, which has absolutely no

would frustrate or interfere with the operation -QUESTION:

With full knowledge, when the

3

President did that, that there were these laws in

4

California.

5

MR. GELLER:

And at the time that the -- that

6

these laws were in the process of being passed, the

7

President's personal representative, Stuart Eizenstat,

8

wrote a letter to the Governor of California saying,

9

please do not pass this law because it will interfere with

10

what the United States is trying to do in the area of

11

foreign policy, and I think it would be a shame if this

12

law went into effect because of the disastrous impact it

13

would have on the ICHEIC system, which the President of

14

the United States -- which two successive Presidents of

15

the United States have concluded is in the best foreign

16

policy interests of the United States, and the best

17

interest of Holocaust victims in order to get money into

18

their hands quickly.

19

But secondly, Justice O'Connor, in addition to

20

the foreign affairs power, we think this is a blatant

21

violation of the -- of the Foreign Commerce Clause, which

22

once again is not within the power of the States to

23

interfere with.

I think most of the information in

the record, Justice Ginsburg, and the information that the

State relies on relates to several years ago, not to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The California statute at issue here is not a

11

statute of general application that happens to have an

12

incidental impact on foreign Nations, foreign countries,

13

or foreign transactions.

14

exclusively and specifically with respect to a category of

15

foreign insurance transactions occurring in foreign

16

countries between foreign companies and foreign nationals

17

more than 50 years ago, and it concerns a subject matter,

18

the settlement of claims arising out of international

19

conflict, that has -- has always been understood by this

20

Court to be the responsibility of the national Government,

21

as reflected most recently in Dames & Moore.

22

QUESTION:

It is a statute that is written

Mr. Kneedler, I thought that the only

23

requirement is put on a company licensed to do business in

24

the United States.

25

to grab a foreign insurance company that isn't doing

The -- California isn't reaching out

3

California.
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

It is asking questions of

But disclosure is a form of

5

regulation.

This is true, this is obvious from our

6

securities laws, it is -- it is evident from this Court's

7

decision in the BMW case of several years back, where the

8

Court -- which had to do with disclosure, and the Court

9

said that one State may not try to enforce its policies

10

with respect to the disclosure of information in other

11

States, and we think that -QUESTION:

12

Did we do that?

Does the United

13

States do that, or States under blue sky laws in the

14

securities area?

15

affiliates that are set up in --

Do we require disclosures of, say,

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

Under blue sky laws, under the, I

17

believe it's the Hall decision, the Court said that a

18

State could require disclosures -- with respect to

19

in-State transactions it could require disclosures about

20

issuance of securities out of State that are related to

21

in-State transactions.

22

here.

23

We have no in-State transaction

California has claimed two possible connections

24

to the State to justify this statute.

The first is that

25

the companies, the insurance companies, certain insurance

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

companies do business in California.

Those are not the

2

ones that issued these policies, but they do business in

3

California.

4

notably the Connecticut General case that is cited in the

5

petitioner's brief, is a case where the Court said the

6

fact that insurance companies do business in the State is

7

not a sufficient basis for a State in that case to tax

8

transactions, insurance policies that are entered into

9

outside of that State, so it's clear that the fact that

Under this Court's decisions, I think most

10

certain insurance companies do business in the State does

11

not give California a right to regulate through disclosure

12

transactions and policies that happened outside the State

13

and, a fortiori, that's true with respect to foreign

14

transactions.

15

The other interest that California has been --

16

has asserted, which I think Justice Stevens referred to,

17

is the fact that some number, a very small percentage of

18

Holocaust survivors are in California, and with respect to

19

that, this Court's decision in Shutts make, and other

20

decisions make clear that moving to the forum State an

21

adjudicatory jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus, or --

22

or legislative jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus for

23

a State.

24
25

What we have here, again, is one State of the
Union trying to establish its own foreign policy, in the

words of the Zschernig suit --

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, suppose there were no

3

Federal efforts in this area, which there weren't for

4

sometime, and as I said, the executive agreements we're

5

talking about post-dated this California disclosure law,

6

suppose there was nothing, would you still say that

7

because of the potential for interference there could be

8

no State disclosure legislation of this character?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

This, in our view, is -- is

10

a violation of the Constitution.

11

that the longstanding efforts by the National Government

12

to work out cooperative agreements with Germany and -- and

13

other countries in Europe arising out of the Holocaust

14

underscores vividly why this is a matter of national

15

concern, but we would be making the same argument

16

irrespective of that.

17

We think that the --

The -- the structure of our Constitution assigns

18

to the National Government the resolution of foreign

19

policy issues, and this is a -- this is a very major and

20

longstanding foreign policy issue about how foreign

21

countries should resolve claims about their own nationals.

bearing on that -- on that?
MR. KNEEDLER:

As I understand it, one of the big

Does this -- does the

Not, not directly, but -- but we

8

do think that the executive agreement manifests the

9

executive branch's policy with respect to the resolution

10

of Holocaust era claims, and there are, I think, two

11

principal conflicts with respect to the United States

12

policy.

13

the one that was mentioned with respect to the -- to the

14

lists.

15

One is the one, and I want to underscore this,

ICHEIC is establishing essentially a registry,

16

the very thing that California wants to do, but in a much

17

narrower sense that has been negotiated specifically to

18

avoid conflict between German privacy laws and -- and

19

United States law, and what -- what -- through this

20

matching exercise and through use of various lists of --

21

of Holocaust survivor organizations, Jewish organizations,

22

and census lists in Germany will be putting together a

23

pretty comprehensive list of Holocaust survivors and

24

insurance policies issued in Germany to disclose in a way

25

that German authorities believe that list will not violate

I have with the executive agreement argument.

11

It seems

It seems like something further is to be done,

the United States will use its best efforts.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but the best efforts was,

12

it will use its best efforts with State and local

13

governments, in other words in direct communications,

14

and -- and Assistant Secretary -- Secretary Eizenstat and

15

others communicated --

16

QUESTION:

Well, it could sign a supplemental

17

agreement saying that we now agree that these laws should

18

be superseded, just like we did in Pink.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

But this -- this agreement says

20

that -- says two things, that it would be in the interest

21

of the -- this is on page 155a of the -- of the petition

22

appendix, that it would be in the interest of the two

23

countries for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy

24

for the forum of the resolution of claims, and on

25

page 156a the agreement provides for the resolution of

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

claims through ICHEIC and supplemental procedures to be

2

developed through ICHEIC, which includes the development

3

of this -- of this list.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, how does that relate to

5

the litigation that was ongoing in the Eastern District of

6

New York that I think involved a slave labor question?

7

Did the United States take a position that that

8

litigation, which involved people who moved here, or their

9

survivors moved here after, that that was improper

10
11

litigation?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Those -- that did not

12

involve State regulation, that involved private lawsuits,

13

and there was a settlement which the United States

14

encouraged.

15

of the United States Government.

16

Again, this was part of the overall approach

QUESTION:

But you were -- one branch of this

17

was that the -- the United States people who moved here

18

after, there was no connection with them.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

Right, and if -- if --

Well, those plaintiffs were all

21

people who were certainly not in the United States when

22

this happened.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, and if -- if there are

24

sufficient adjudicatory connections to the United States,

25

that would be fine.

this settlement effort.

21

I want to make two important points about the

United States, the -- the Constitution's assignment of

23

responsibility.

24

to the National Government for foreign relations and

25

foreign commerce because any retaliation or any adverse

The Constitution assigns responsibility

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

impact will be felt by the Nation as a whole, not by the

2

State that -- that triggers it, and this is a point that

3

the Court has made in Japan Lines and numerous cases over

4

the years, and this case illustrates that, because what is

5

going on here is complicating.

6

our relations with European countries at a very sensitive

7

time, and you have one State who -- that is not

8

participating in all of those other efforts and doesn't

9

have to balance the -- the insult that might arise from a

10

statute like this against all of the other issues that are

11

on the United States' plate in dealing with foreign

12

Governments at a particular time.

13

It is an impediment with

This is the very reason, that the States don't

14

have enough information and the full responsibility and

15

the National Government has to look out for the interests

16

of the Nation as a whole, why one State may not thrust

17

itself into foreign policy like this.

18

foreign commerce arguments are very complementary of that

19

because they impose independent limitations on a State

20

thrusting its regulatory power outside of not only its own

21

borders but in this case outside the Nation's borders to,

22

again, regulate through disclosure information about

23

insurance policies in other countries.

24

Germany and California insurance regulations generally

25

The due process and

The very fact that

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

questions of privacy and disclosure are matters of

regulation.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, would your argument be

4

different if California, instead of providing this

5

registry in public disclosure said, we want this

6

information in order to decide whether we will allow these

7

companies to do business in California?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

May I -- may I answer?

9

Yes, that would present a different question.

10

We don't think that California could require this blanket

11

disclosure.

12

under this Court's decision in Aerospaciale, there may be

13

some ability for the State to request certain relevant

14

information --

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23

MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
California's reporting statute addresses a

24

despicable practice by insurance companies.

That practice

25

is the deception of elderly Holocaust survivors in the

Alderson Reporting Company

refusal to provide them with basic policy information.

California responded to this insurance --

QUESTION:

7

Was the United States unaware of this

problem when it negotiated an executive agreement?
MR. KAPLAN:

Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy.

8

The United States was well aware of California's efforts

9

in this regard.

The 1998 statute that was referred to

10

earlier that was passed by Congress occurred about

11

4 months after there was substantial testimony at a

12

congressional hearing in which several State insurance

13

commissioners --

14

QUESTION:

No, my -- my question was, was

15

United -- the United States unaware of -- of the

16

wrongdoing that you're describing to us, or the -- or the

17

inappropriate corporate response, and the answer is, I

18

assume that they were, and they did nothing about it in

19

the executive agreement, other than to have this very

20

specific claims procedure.

21

MR. KAPLAN:

22

QUESTION:

7

least for me, doesn't concern the desirability of the

8

9

totally undesirable.

I'll concede, absolutely it's

10

The problem, I think, for your side in my mind

11

is letters, for example, from the Deputy Under Secretary

12

of State Eizenstat to California, the insurance

13

commissioner and the Governor, about this very statute,

14

where he's speaking in an official capacity to say that

15

the statute has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one

16

effective means now at hand to process quickly and

17

completely unpaid insurance claims from the Holocaust

18

period, that this law has already potentially damaged and

19

could derail the settlement, et cetera, so the record is

20

full of the Deputy Under Secretary of State who negotiated

21

the settlement, Eizenstat, Ambassadors, the President,

22

lists of -- in treaties, or executive agreements anyway,

23

and you the -- and you know what I'm referring to.

24

right.

25

Why doesn't all of that, taken together,

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

All

1

constitute what Justice Harlan in dissent in Zschernig

2

called a Federal policy in the foreign affairs area, so

3

that if we take the dissent in Zschernig it would seem,

4

hypothetically, for -- I'm trying to get your answer --

5

that that long list of things shows a Federal policy such

6

that Harlan and Stewart and the others, Harlan being at

7

the extreme there, would have to say that California's

8

statute is contrary to the Federal policy in this area,

9

has an impact on foreign affairs of a negative nature

10

through the conflict with the privacy statutes of

11

Switzerland and Germany, and therefore is contrary to the

12

foreign affairs power given to the executive branch by

13

Article 2 of the Constitution.

14

All right, that's a long question, but those are

15

the things that I'd like you very much to focus on from my

16

point of view.

17

MR. KAPLAN:

I will, Justice Breyer.

Thank you.

18

We're dealing here with a State commercial

Nobody claims that there is preemption.

What

10

they are claiming is, is that there is interference with,

11

in Harlan's words, a Federal policy in the foreign affairs

12

area, so if you're taking the position it has to be

13

preemptive under the Supremacy Clause, then you're saying

14

that all this material is totally irrelevant.

15
16
17

Now, that's a possible position, but I want to
know what your view is.
MR. KAPLAN:

Our view is that where the

18

executive simply expresses an aspiration where -- which is

19

the situation here, where he's indicated he'll use his

20

best efforts, it's no different than --

21

QUESTION:

Oh, no, it's -- what I've read to you

22

is not an aspiration.

23

by the Deputy Secretary of State --

24

MR. KAPLAN:

25

QUESTION:

What I read to you were statements

Yes.

-- that said the California statute

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

is totally contrary to the efforts that they were trying

2

to make.

3

California is illegal, and that's why I'm -- that's what I

4

want you to explore.

I would -- of course, it's not legally saying

MR. KAPLAN:

The response, Justice Breyer, is

Under the Barclay's decision, Congress is the

QUESTION:

I thought Barclay's had to do with

the Commerce Clause.
MR. KAPLAN:

It dealt with both the Commerce

11

Clause and the foreign affairs power.

12

was taken for review by the Court.

13

dispose of that, and we believe that the foreign affairs

14

issue is subsumed within the Barclay's decision when

15

you're dealing with matters of State commercial

16

regulation.

17

QUESTION:

The Zschernig case

The Court did not

The -- Barclay's dealt with the

18

Foreign Commerce Clause, and it made the point that the

19

one voice in that area was Congress, not the President.

20

It wasn't dealing -- that case did not deal with executive

21

agreements, as I recall it, and I think I have a pretty

22

good memory of that case.

23

MR. KAPLAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

And that being so, you see, the --

this is not the same for that reason, and also what we're

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

talking about here is, the Governments of Switzerland and

2

the Governments of Germany, not private people, saying

3

that if California enforces this statute, 98 percent of

4

which has nothing to do with Holocaust victims, that is,

5

the insurance policies don't, that is, what we're worried

6

about under our privacy statutes is Gwendolyn finds out

7

that Uncle Harry in England left all the money to Cecily

8

instead of Gwendolyn and, of course, Cecily doesn't want

9

that to occur.

That's her private affair.

That's why

10

Germany and Switzerland have laws that say these matters

11

are quiet, silent, private, and those Governments are

12

telling us that your statute violates their privacy law

13

because of its overbreadth.
MR. KAPLAN:

14

Foreign Governments were

15

extraordinarily upset about the -- the tax that was the

16

subject of the Barclay's case.

17

Government passed retaliatory legislation, and this --

18

this Court found that that was not sufficient when there

19

was no specific indication by Congress of an intent to bar

20

the State law.
Here, you've had testimony by Deputy Secretary

21
22

In fact, the British

Eizenstat before Congress -QUESTION:

23

Yes, but -- but that's -- the

24

Congress has principal concern with revenue and fiscal

25

policy.

It doesn't have principal concern with foreign

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

policy.

It's very different.
QUESTION:

And that was the reason that Barclay

3

said you -- yes, you're right that the executive branch

4

was in there saying look, all these foreign countries are

5

upset, and we think that they have a good case.

6

the executive position, and this Court said, but you're

7

dealing in an area where Congress has the lead, holds the

8

lead rein and not the President.

9

that -- we -- when we were talking about the Foreign

That was

That's the only point

10

Commerce Clause authority, that's a different question

11

than the executive authority.

12

MR. KAPLAN:

I -- I believe, Justice Ginsburg,

13

the issue here is whether the President, by engaging in

14

some negotiation, or expressing an aspiration as to what

15

the President thinks the foreign policy ought to be, can

16

trump a State regulation, and I think the consequence of

17

that being so would be dramatic for matters of State

18

regulation, because State regulation often has some sort

19

of foreign implication to it, since we're dealing with a

20

global economy and there are often foreign affiliates that

21

are called upon to report on information, and if -- if

22

that law was overturned because a foreign Government or

23

the executive branch complained about that conduct, State

24

regulatory law would effectively be thwarted.

25

QUESTION:

Well, we can -- we can distinguish

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

those cases.

As -- as pointed out by -- by your

2

adversary, the difference in this law is that it is only

3

directed at foreign Nations.

4

MR. KAPLAN:

5

QUESTION:

No -- no, Your Honor --

The -- the only -- the only

6

disclosure required is -- is by affiliates abroad, isn't

7

it?

8
9

MR. KAPLAN:

Justice Scalia, that's not correct.

The disclosures are required by California licensees,

10

including companies that wrote insurance who were

11

California licensees.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

What disclosures are required by

those licensees?
MR. KAPLAN:

Disclosure of the name of the

15

policyholder, where the policyholder lived, and the name

16

of the beneficiary --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. KAPLAN:

19

Yes.
-- and the status of the policy as

to whether it's paid --

20

QUESTION:

Of policies written by them?

21

MR. KAPLAN:

Yes, or their affiliates.

Or their

22

affiliates.

23

Generali has been licensed to do business in California

24

since 1935 --

25

You have a situation, for example, where

QUESTION:

Policies written anywhere in the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

world?

2

MR. KAPLAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

Written in Europe.

Ah.

In other words, it's only

directed at the regulation of foreign matters.

5

MR. KAPLAN:

6

QUESTION:

It's -- it's direct --

We can -- we can easily distinguish

7

those -- those California's laws that -- that are general

8

laws which have some indirect effect upon foreign affairs.

9

This -- this thing is directed at foreign operations.
MR. KAPLAN:

10

It's directed at a concern that

11

California has by reason of the migration of -- of a large

12

number of Holocaust survivors to the State and, in fact,

13

the numbers that we've indicated in our submissions, Your

14

Honor, are that there are at least 20,000 Jewish Holocaust

15

survivors, and we don't know how many non-Jewish Holocaust

16

survivors there are in the State.
QUESTION:

17

And to that -- and for that reason

18

California candidly made specifically reference to

19

Nazi-controlled Germany, to present-day Germany, and to

20

Europe, and to the Holocaust, none of which are of

21

California's concern when it conflicts with the

22

President's power to deal with those matters.
MR. KAPLAN:

23

Justice Kennedy, I -- I guess I

24

disagree.

I think California has a substantial concern.

25

It has a concern about people in the State who don't have

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

basic policy information that they're seeking.
QUESTION:

Why don't they, because you see,

3

as -- as it's been argued to us anyway, there are two ways

4

of achieving this result.

5

privately people whom you select, or trust, to go through

6

the 10 million policies that were sold, pick out all those

7

that might have to do with Holocaust victims, and make

8

them public.

9

Eizenstat negotiated.

10

Way number 1 would have

I take it that's the route that Secretary

The other way is California's way, which is, you

11

make the whole 10 million public, so Gwendolyn and

12

everybody else finds out everybody else's information,

13

which happens to be a way that would violate the privacy

14

laws of Switzerland and Germany.

15
16
17

Now, what interest does California have in doing
it the second way, rather than the first way?
MR. KAPLAN:

California has an interest in

18

obtaining information that companies doing business in the

19

State have so far exhibited they're unwilling to provide.

20

By requiring the information that the law asks for, we

21

will be sure that there's no further stonewalling

22

occurring in the State, and that companies that want to do

23

business in the State will not engage in that conduct in

24

the future.

25

It will also assure that people --

QUESTION:

Well, it looks like the way this

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

scheme is written is, the -- the companies doing business

2

in California have to provide the information even if

3

they're unable to do so, even if when they go to an

4

affiliated, or company related somewhere down the line,

5

let's say in Germany or Austria, and ask for the

6

information, and German or Austrian law prohibits that

7

from being disclosed, then the California company will

8

have its license yanked.
MR. KAPLAN:

9

Now, what kind of law is that?

It's the same kind of law, Your

10

Honor, that the Europeans practice, too.

We've cited

11

something in the record.

12

appears at 2 E.R. 2747 to 2748.

13

like State regulators, deal with situations all the time

14

where there may be a conflict with a foreign law or the

15

law of another State, and if States are -- are able to

16

effectively regulate the business that -- that is going on

17

in the State and the companies doing business here, they

18

have to have the right to be able to apply their law.

19

Otherwise, there could be a law established

It's the European directive that
European regulators, just

20

in -- in the Cayman Islands that established a privacy

21

right for companies doing business in the State, and a --

22

a company could assert that the law of a foreign country

23

precluded that company from -- from complying with a State

24

regulatory law, and we don't think that's how the law

25

works.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, are -- are you saying that

2

there is no way that the United States could act that

3

would, in fact, have that effect?

4

MR. KAPLAN:

5

QUESTION:

I'm sorry --

I mean, if -- if Congress passed a

6

statute in effect condemning what California had done, not

7

repealing McCarran-Ferguson but simply condemning it,

8

or -- or authorizing the President specifically to make

9

what the -- the agreements that the President has made on

10

an executive basis now, are you saying that neither of

11

those acts in effect would preclude California from doing

12

what it is doing under this statute?
MR. KAPLAN:

13
14

No, Justice Souter.

I think you'd

have a serious preemption problem there under the -QUESTION:

15

Okay, so it -- it boils down, then,

16

to an argument about the executive power alone, is that

17

correct?

18
19
20

MR. KAPLAN:

Yes, it does.

It boils down to a

separation of -QUESTION:

Well, is -- is your argument -- and

21

I -- I will be quiet after this question and let you say

22

whatever you wanted, but what I want you to focus on is --

23

MR. KAPLAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

-- do you take the position that

whenever the executive, let's say, agreement by

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

executive -- action by executive agreement is, in the

2

opinion of a State regulator, inadequate to address the

3

regulatory problem as the regulator sees it, that the

4

regulator is free, in effect, to disregard the policy in

5

the executive agreement?
MR. KAPLAN:

6

Do you take that position?

I do unless the executive agreement

7

is preemptive and unless there's something else about the

8

executive agreement that would give it preemptive quality.

9

Clearly, the executive agreement -QUESTION:

10

Well, are we talking about form of

11

words?

If the President and executive agreements had in

12

effect said, and no State can do anything which is

13

inconsistent with this policy, would your position be

14

different?
MR. KAPLAN:

15

It might be, because I think you'd

16

be dealing with a situation there where arguably it would

17

be a preemptive executive agreement which might carry the

18

same status as a -- a statute by Congress.

19

QUESTION:

Why does he have to --

20

QUESTION:

What if Congress had -- had ratified

21

what the President did so that it's no longer just an act

22

of the President but an act of the President approved by

23

Congress?

24
25

Would your position be any different?
MR. KAPLAN:

Your Honor, then you might have a

situation like Dames & Moore, where there was a pattern of

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

congressional acquiescence in the kind of executive

2

agreements that occurred there.
QUESTION:

3

Well, but this isn't -- this isn't

4

just acquiescence in a -- in an executive agreement.

5

is Congress saying, we approve and ratify it.
MR. KAPLAN:

6

This

Then -- then you might have the

7

kind of specific disapproval of State action that this

8

Court talked about in the Barclay's case.
QUESTION:

9

You don't --

Well, why would it be any more

10

specific than this is?

11

expressly preemptive, and Congress passes a statute

12

saying, we agree with it; we think the executive agreement

13

is right on the money, it wouldn't, in fact, be any more

14

restrictive or less restrictive than it is now.
MR. KAPLAN:

15

If the executive agreement is not

I -- I think the difference, Your

16

Honor, is then you have Congress acting, you have Congress

17

speaking, which is what this Court in Barclay's thought

18

was the appropriate actor to speak in matters of foreign

19

commerce.

20

QUESTION:

Congress makes laws.

The President

21

doesn't make laws.

I'm not sure that the President can

22

make an executive agreement preemptive which is not

23

preemptive in its nature.

24

is, is there any -- any State action which is inconsistent

25

with our foreign policy expressed in this agreement is

I mean, all -- all he can say

Alderson Reporting Company

invalid, but that's not -- not something that occurs by

2

reason of his pronouncement.

3

all, by reason of the Constitution, automatically, so it

really doesn't matter whether he says that or not.

saying it cannot make it happen, and his not saying it, I

Then I won't.

that --

15

is, if you agree with that, that you're then going to say

16

on the tough kinds of things that you raised, how do we

17

know if this is a Cayman Island situation fake, or how do

18

we know if it's a really genuine important policy of a

19

foreign Government, say, the privacy policy?

20

There are one of two people who can decide that,

21

the Secretary of State or, say, the Governor or Insurance

22

Commissioner of California and the problem for you, I

23

think, is that the Constitution seems to give the

24

authority to decide that to the Secretary of State and not

25

the Insurance Commissioner of California because it's a

47
Alderson Reporting Company

foreign affairs matter.
MR. KAPLAN:

MR. KAPLAN:

Congress is supposed to run

9

objections by foreign Governments about the way States are

10

behaving.

If they -- if they think they're behaving

badly, then the executive can go to Congress, lodge a

complaint, and if Congress is so inclined, Congress can do

I'm saying the

McCarran-Ferguson Act is the voice of Congress, the -QUESTION:

Well, but you just said a moment ago

that Congress had -- had approved this.
MR. KAPLAN:

Yes.

Congress has approved

it either implicitly or directly through the

10

McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the States authority to

11

act in matters of insurance.

12

Act Congress, in effect, endorsed State action to deal

13

with Holocaust insurance matters.

14

QUESTION:

In the Holocaust Commission

Is it not true that the -- what the

15

Congress endorsed there was presidential leadership, not

16

State action?

17

MR. KAPLAN:

But in -- but in that statute

18

Congress recognized that States were acting in this area.

19

The statute said that the commission there should

20

coordinate its activities with the States, and it asked

21

the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to

22

pass -- to prepare a report, rather, on the activities of

23

foreign and domestic insurance companies doing business in

24

this country, and the Ninth Circuit found, and we believe

25

it was reasonable for it to find that Congress

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

anticipated, understood, and -- and knew that -- that the

2

States would be acting pursuant to State law and might

3

have to seek information from entities located outside the

4

borders of this country.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Kaplan, there -- there was a

6

reason, I think, why the Federal Constitution gave the

7

power to conduct foreign affairs not to the Congress but

8

to the executive, and the reason was that Congress is not

9

a very good instrument for that purpose, that there are

10

all sorts of matters that come up where -- this being one

11

of them, where it is very difficult for a Member of

12

Congress to cast a vote against Holocaust victims.

13

what we're talking about.

That's

14

Why -- why should the situation exist that,

15

although the President has the responsibility without

16

Congress for conducting foreign affairs, his conduct of

17

foreign affairs can be frustrated by the States unless

18

Congress comes to his assistance?

19

follow?

20

Why -- why should that

It would seem to me it should follow that he can

21

protect this foreign affairs field on his own, and does

22

not have to call for the assistance of Congress.

23

MR. KAPLAN:

We believe that that would lead

24

to -- to a situation where, any time the executive decides

25

that there's a matter of -- of foreign policy concern to

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

him, legitimate State regulation would have to take a back

2

seat to that, so you have, in essence, presidential

3

lawmaking without any --

MR. KAPLAN:

Well --- any sort of accountability that

you normally have -QUESTION:

7

It just shifts -- it just shifts the

8

inertia, really.

Congress is the 900-pound gorilla.

9

it doesn't like what the President is doing in the field

of foreign affairs, it can stop him as quickly as it

likes.

14

Congress always has the trump card.

15

All it has to do is pass a resolution cutting off

But why should we -- should we require Congress

16

to protect the President from the States?

17

he have an automatic protection from it?

18

MR. KAPLAN:

Why shouldn't

Because except in limited areas

19

such as Zschernig, in Belmont, in Pink, and in Dames &

20

Moore, where you have a foreign policy crisis or a

21

recognition, ordinarily I don't believe that this Court

22

wants the executive to go off and announce foreign

23

policy issues that will have effect on State regulation.

24

It affects issues of federalism and separation of powers.

25

Here, in fact, it was the State regulators that

51

1

formed ICHEIC.

This was a creature of the State
