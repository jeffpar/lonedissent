CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 02-575, Nike, Inc. versus Marc Kasky.
Mr. Tribe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

10

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the mid-1990s there was, of course, an

11

intense debate on the pros and cons of globalization, and

12

of the impact of companies like Nike on workers in the

13

Third World, where Nike contracted out much of its

14

production to some 900 factories in 51 countries with over

15

600,000 employees.

16

Now, the critics, many from pro-labor groups,

17

denounced Nike as the chief exemplar of the evils of

18

globalization, arguing that Nike was simply shifting

19

production to places where it could exploit the workforce

20

and act in ways that were illegal and immoral, and the

21

critics took much of their documentation from the media.

22

Of course, Nike disagreed, using the same media

23

venues as the critics had used to document what it thought

24

were the connections between its presence and activities

25

in countries like South Korea and Vietnam and the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

development of technological expertise in those countries,

2

as well as the expansion of job opportunities there, and

3

also arguing that it had put in place significant

4

safeguards against abuse.

5

Products were mentioned only in response to

6

people who said, well, look, this product is made in

7

such-and-such country and it's exploitative, and Nike

8

would have a press release, or it -- sometimes it would be

9

an op ed saying no, you've got the wrong country, this

10

product is made in such-and-such other place.

11

letters to the editor, pamphlets.

12

correspondence.

13

These were

It was on the Internet,

As you might expect, the critics talked back.

14

There was a lively political dialogue about the realities

15

of the Third World and Nike's role in it, a little hard to

16

separate the two, when, as the dissenter below, one of the

17

dissenters below said Nike had become the poster child for

18

the evils, supposedly, of globalization, so not

19

surprisingly the debate was inconclusive.

20

The surprise came when the story took an unusual

21

turn, unusual at least in our system of Government.

22

of the Nike critics, Marc Kasky, asked the California

23

courts to endorse his view and to hold that the statements

24

that Nike was putting out were false or were misleading.

25

He invoked California's unfair competition law and the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

One

1

false advertising law that it included, which gives anyone

2

standing, so Mr. Kasky certainly qualified, to sue another

3

person or corporation, here Nike and its officers, for

4

making any statement in a newspaper or other publication

5

such, it goes on to say, or any advertising device,

6

including over the Internet, concerning any circumstance

7

or matter of fact connected with anything the speaker

8

intends to sell if the statement is untrue or misleading,

9

and the California Supreme Court has read that to cover

10
11

anything that might mislead the public.
The plaintiff, empowered to sue by the Business

12

and Professions Code 17204 on behalf of, quote, the

13

general public, unquote, did not, under California

14

decisional law, have to allege or prove falsity -- it

15

could be an omission that made something misleading -- he

16

didn't have to allege or prove reliance by or injury to

17

anyone, or any particular level of fault.

18

omission will suffice under the Day decision.

19

QUESTION:

An inadvertent

Well, certainly some omissions, even

20

though not technically false, could be false in their --

21

in what they convey.

22

MR. TRIBE:

Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and,

23

in fact, one of the suggestions made by the California

24

Supreme Court for how a company could engage in this

25

debate without any problem is simply omit all the facts

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that might connect it to the situation, and that kind of

2

omission, it would be certainly alleged, would be

3

misleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is,

4

talk in vague generalities.

5

I don't deny, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can

6

be cases and there can even be fraud cases, though it's

7

hard, given the pleading requirements of the fraud tort,

8

that do rest on omissions, but I'm just suggesting how --

9

how capacious -- how capacious this is.

10

The relief that is available and was requested

11

by Mr. Kasky includes, and I don't think we should forget

12

the importance of this, an adjudication that the defendant

13

is guilty of an unlawful business practice, and in Nike's

14

case that would be no small matter.

15

said you're guilty of exploiting women and children in the

16

Third World, guilty as charged, and not being honest about

17

it, a scarlet letter more damning than the label of

18

National Labor Relations Act violator that this Court a

19

year ago in B&K versus NLRB treated as so grave a blot on

20

the reputation of a company that it mustn't be imposed for

21

activity within the First Amendment zone without giving

22

the defendant significant leeway.

23

I mean, it would be

Secondly, there is available a court-ordered

24

injunction both prohibitory and mandatory in one case

25

involving the Alta-Dena Dairy in California under this

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

statute.

2

the suit as a Private Attorney General against a dairy

3

that had been putting out its products of raw milk saying

4

they were just as nutritious and healthy as pasteurized

5

milk, and the remedy was a 10-year mandate of corrective

6

speech, as it were, corrective education.

7
8
9

The Consumers Union of the United States brought

QUESTION:

To -- to make them realize that raw

milk was not as good as pasteurized milk?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, I guess to make some people --

10

this -- that's what the statute says, that some people

11

might have been misled.

12

trial that would be involved in this case is a lot more

13

expensive than that one.

14

Needless to say, the kind of show

That case, by the way, took 54 days to try,

15

44 witnesses, there were 40,000 pages of exhibits, at the

16

end a restitutionary order of $100,000 was given, and in

17

that case the Attorney General joined the suit, he

18

collected the restitution --

19

QUESTION:

Do -- do we have a case in which we

20

say that a -- a civil scheme -- I -- I suppose there are

21

some criminal remedies here, but let's just think about

22

this as a civil scheme, that a civil scheme of this type

23

is so burdensome, so extensive that it chills speech and

24

is therefore invalid?

25

MR. TRIBE:

I -- I -Well, I suppose Bantam Books --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

We -- we have plenty of cases that

2

the criminal laws are either vague or overly broad and

3

that they chill speech.

4

MR. TRIBE:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TRIBE:

What about in the civil context?

I think Bantam Books comes to mind.
Yes.
And there it was less than this, it

7

was simply you were on a list of books.

8

that the Court in the National Labor Relations Act context

9

itself took the position in B&K that chilling effect was

10

It seems to me

important, and what about defamation?

11

I mean, the central meaning of New York Times v.

12

Sullivan and Gertz and, you know, and Time v. Hill is that

13

even when you have someone who is harmed, reputational

14

harm, concrete harm, so that the regulation of speech is

15

simply ancillary to vindicating tangible interest, even

16

there the chilling effect is so great that even though

17

there's no positive value in false statements you have to

18

put a burden -- it's a matter of public interest.
QUESTION:

19

You would have to say that this

20

complaint and the adjudicatory system it wished to invoke

21

chills speech, therefore the complaint must be dismissed.

22

I mean, is that the remedy you're -MR. TRIBE:

23
24
25

Well, essentially that's right,

that -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, this --

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. TRIBE:

-- this trial itself is

illegitimate.
QUESTION:

3

-- this -- but this Court has said

4

that even though commercial speech concerns a public

5

issue, it's still commercial speech --

6

MR. TRIBE:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes.
-- and we've applied a different test

to commercial speech.

9

MR. TRIBE:

10

QUESTION:

11

said that in Bolger.

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
We said that in Central Hudson, we

Yes.
How do you distinguish those?
Well, let me say two things, Justice

First of all the Court has never said that the

15

O'Connor.

16

Constitution and its First Amendment are wholly invisible

17

to commercial speech, that is, if you're going after

18

commercial harms, then there's a lower standard for

19

commercial speech, the four-part Central Hudson test.

20

Discovery Network made clear that if you're coming at it

21

from a different angle, commercial speech is just as good

22

as anything else.

23

R.A.V., I think, dispelled the notion that the

24

Constitution has these blind spots and, indeed, the whole

25

approach of the Court below and of Mr. Kasky was, we don't

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

even have to deal with your First Amendment arguments -QUESTION:

2
3

that -MR. TRIBE:

4
5

Well, do you -- you take the view

-- because it's misleading

commercial speech.
QUESTION:

6

-- none of the things alleged in the

7

complaint meet the commercial speech test set out in

8

Central Hudson?

9

MR. TRIBE:

Actually, we --

10

QUESTION:

Not one of them?

11

MR. TRIBE:

That's right, Justice O'Connor, we

12

don't think any of them do, but even if they did, this

13

scheme --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TRIBE:

What part do they take?
Well, actually, they don't come

16

close in general, and I think the best way to illustrate

17

that is to look not at the various verbal formulas that

18

have been used by this Court in terms of whether it's

19

advertising format, whether it's -- in one case I think

20

Justice Stevens talked about something being

21

transaction-driven, but look at the example that this

22

court gave in Central Hudson when it was addressing the

23

question, when we allow greater regulation of speech that

24

is closely connected with the Government's power to

25

regulate commercial transactions we're not in any way

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

limiting your ability directly to comment.
The example that was given was the pamphlet from

3

the Con Ed case.

That was an example of direct comment,

4

and you look at the pamphlet which was in the joint

5

appendix in -- in that case, and it turns out the pamphlet

6

is a detailed set of statements about why nuclear power is

7

safer, better, cheaper, better for our independence, and

8

you know what, Con Ed had a nuclear power plant, Indian

9

Point, they clearly had an economic interest in promoting

10

that view, and that's the closest any of these statements

11

by Nike come --

12

QUESTION:

13

in your mind of two documents.

14

that Nike sent to the -- the athletic managers.

15

MR. TRIBE:

16

QUESTION:

17

Document 1 is the letter

Yes.
And then put that side by side with

the document in the Bolger case, and --

18

MR. TRIBE:

19

QUESTION:

20

No, no, but there's another -- think

Yes.
-- that's the -- the discussion of

venereal disease.

21

MR. TRIBE:

Right.

22

QUESTION:

23

write an opinion, let's say --

24

MR. TRIBE:

25

QUESTION:

Now, what -- now, I -- you have to

Yes.
-- that says the difference between

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

these is?
MR. TRIBE:

2

Is that the letter to the university

3

presidents and to the athletic departments of these

4

universities, which is Exhibit R at page 190 of the

5

lodging, is an extended argument about why the claims

6

against Nike are unfounded.

7

doesn't have Air Jordans on it --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TRIBE:

10

It is not in any of its -- it

And then the letter about the --- the way Trojan condoms were --

condoms were at the end of that --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.
-- submission, and in the Bolger

13

case again, I think if I were writing such an opinion I

14

would say, in Bolger we again reiterated the formula that

15

had been used in Central Hudson and gave as an example of

16

something that was not commercial speech the promotional

17

pamphlet.

18

it was sent to?

19

Con Ed.

20

doubt that that was speech that had as its audience only

21

those people who purchased from Con Ed, whereas in this

22

case, these guys are not direct purchasers, and moreover,

23

and I think decisively, that's the closest that anything

24

in this case comes to commercial speech.

25

That -- that was sent to some -- you know who
It was sent only to the customers of

It was an insert in the bills, so there's no

QUESTION:

And as long as we're writing

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

distinctions --

2

MR. TRIBE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. TRIBE:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes.

I think --

-- how do I write this distinction?
Well -The FTC -- sorry, if you're not

finished.
MR. TRIBE:

7

I'm sorry.

I was only going to add

8

that Mr. Kasky, even though he has standing to do a great

9

deal --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.
-- does not have standing to sue on

12

behalf of the athletic directors, it turns out, because

13

the California courts in the Rosenbluth case in 2002 said

14

that this is a law where you're supposed to represent the

15

public, not sophisticated organizations, because they

16

might have their own interests, so to the closest this

17

case comes --

18

QUESTION:

Is it supposed to be like the

19

Attorney General, Mr. Tribe --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. TRIBE:

22

QUESTION:

But Mr. Tribe, as I understand it -I'm sorry.
This sets up a Private Attorney

23

General so this -- Mr. Kasky is representing the public,

24

but you've been talking about the great breadth of this

25

statute, and I understand all that, but where -- at just

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the threshold, the cases were thrown out in the lower

2

courts because they said there's no circumstances, there's

3

nothing you can narrow this complaint down to, not one

4

piece of literature.

5

MR. TRIBE:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, it's -Nothing, not one, and the -- the

7

problem with this case is that it comes to us at such a

8

preliminary stage.

9

there's been no narrowing of anything, so am I right in

There's been nothing like a trial,

10

thinking that to prevail you would have to show that none

11

of these, that there's not one that would survive past a

12

motion to dismiss?
MR. TRIBE:

13

No, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's

14

not right, because what the court of appeals said in this

15

case -- and its opinion I think merits reading.

16

least as good as the dissents in the California Supreme

17

Court.

18

It's at

What it said was, not that we can't pick and

19

choose somewhere in this pile of scattered material, as it

20

described it, something that under a different scheme

21

might be permissible.

22

making the courts pawns in a public debate and having what

23

amounts to -- they didn't use the phrase, show trial, but

24

essentially they were saying a trial in which you, in

25

effect, put on trial such a large and massive question and

What we hold is impermissible is

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

hopeless mix of fact and opinion as the impact on the

2

Third World of this large company.

3

Now --

4

QUESTION:

What's -- what is your best reason

5

for saying this is a show trial?

6

a new category, and I had thought your best reason was,

7

and -- and I want to know whether you agree with me or

8

whether there's something better --

9

MR. TRIBE:

10

QUESTION:

In other words, you want

Yes.
I thought your best reason was that

11

there is no, no need for any allegation and in fact no

12

allegation that anyone among the plaintiffs or among

13

the -- the class on behalf of which they sue, the public,

14

was injured in any demonstrable way.

15

MR. TRIBE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. TRIBE:

Is that the point?

That -Is that what the show trial thing -That's probably the single strongest

18

point, and let me connect it with a broader theme, because

19

in Discovery Network, when this Court talked about the

20

fact that commercial speech is a category that's relevant

21

when you're going after commercial harm, in a sense to

22

protect consumers from fraud of one kind or another, in

23

the reputation area it is again not speech alone you're

24

going after.

25

in not being harmed.

You're trying to vindicate certain interests
You have to have someone whose

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

reputation is harmed.
QUESTION:

2

Suppose a California regulatory

3

agency signed its name as the plaintiff to this -- to this

4

complaint.
MR. TRIBE:

5

Well, I think simply adding a name

6

wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.

7

General of California put his arm around the Consumer's

8

Union in the Alta-Dena case, but in this case you need

9

a --

10
11

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TRIBE:

15

QUESTION:

17

No, no, but -- but we have -- we have

some cases, like the Egg Commission case and so forth --

12

16

The Attorney

Right.
-- where the FTC or the FDA -Right.
-- has I, think, a certain standing.

It doesn't have to show injury to itself.
MR. TRIBE:

That's right, but it does have to

18

show, the statutes are written to require it to show that

19

there is an area of legitimate regulatory concern.

20

Consumers might be fooled into believing, by the Egg

21

Nutrition Council, that cholesterol is good for your

22

heart, and they're trying to protect them.

23

QUESTION:

Well, you know what we're -- you know

24

what we're going to hear next, that the Californians are

25

very interested in this.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. TRIBE:

Well, first of all, if they're very

2

interested they can do a number of things.

3

something like -- Congress passed the Dolphin Protection

4

Act saying, if you really care about dolphins, then

5

whenever a can of tuna is sold, it can't use the phrase,

6

dolphin-friendly, unless certain things are met.

7

California did this with ozone at one point and then it

8

repealed the ozone-friendly law.

9

They can pass

But giving a company an idea of what it has to

10

disclose and what the issues are going to be is very

11

different from saying, well, here we are, we're sitting

12

here and waiting until somebody --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And again -- and again, your best

case for this is Bantam Books, or -MR. TRIBE:

Well, I -- no, I think the

16

defamation line of cases is even better, because at a

17

minimum they show that you have to have someone who's

18

harmed, and you have to have deliberate or reckless

19

falsehood.

20

Imagine a law --

QUESTION:

Why isn't -- why isn't it -- going

21

back to Justice Kennedy's question, why shouldn't it be

22

sufficient to say that when it is the State rather than

23

any citizen, self-selected, who brings this suit, we would

24

at least depend upon some State --

25

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. TRIBE:

3

QUESTION:

-- political responsibility -Yes.
-- and accountability as -- as our --

4

our safeguard, and we would let that go forward because we

5

don't think there's enough risk of improper chilling?

6

The distinction is, when anybody can walk in --

7

MR. TRIBE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Right.
-- there's no accountability.

Why

isn't that the line to draw?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, it seems to me, Justice

11

Souter, that's a line enough to reverse this decision, but

12

let me just imagine --

13

QUESTION:

Why, when it wasn't raised below?

14

One of the problems is, if you were going to take out this

15

Private Attorney General, you would be saying this statute

16

is unconstitutional, pro tonto.

17

It didn't surface 'til this Court.

MR. TRIBE:

It was.

That wasn't argued below.

It was, Justice Ginsburg.

19

On pages 12 to 14 of our reply brief we detailed the

20

sequence, and if you look back at the briefs in the

21

California Supreme Court the arguments, all of the First

22

Amendment arguments were made, but they didn't get to

23

first base in that court because it said, hey, misleading

24

commercial speech gets no protection.

QUESTION:

Where was the notice --

MR. TRIBE:

2

QUESTION:

I was going to give an example -Where was the notice to the

3

California Attorney General that the statute was being,

4

the constitutionality of that statute was being attacked

5

with regard to the Private Attorney General here?
MR. TRIBE:

6

It was only as applied, Justice

7

Ginsburg.

That is, it does not suggest -- these laws have

8

been on the books since the '30s, and we're not suggesting

9

that they have to be scrapped.

10

QUESTION:

I thought that -- that Justice

11

Souter's question to you was --

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14

It's the innovative --

Yes.
-- isn't what infects these laws,

that -- that you are allowing a champion --

15

MR. TRIBE:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- who has no public accountability,

17

and it doesn't -- I don't see how that comes to be an

18

as-applied challenge.

19

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's an

20

as-applied challenge, because these laws, if applied only

21

in cases where harm is alleged and where a court says, to

22

solve the problem we're going to require that it be

23

proved, that is, it would be the California courts that

24

would have to redesign the system to fix it, wouldn't be

25

unconstitutional.

1

I wanted to get --

2

QUESTION:

I thought that the question that was

3

put to you is, isn't this statute infirm in every instance

4

where you have a Private Attorney General?

5

MR. TRIBE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. TRIBE:

Who alleges no harm, and -Well, that's what the statute says.
Well, I think it has to be -- I -- I

8

think it probably is, but I think that the reason that

9

it's not cured, although I agree very much with the

10

position the Solicitor General takes that that's the

11

deepest disease, even if it's taken out, imagine a law

12

that said, if you utter a defamatory statement that is

13

knowingly false, we're going to impose a gag order.

14

if the Attorney General administered it, you'd need to

15

have a possible victim.

16

Even

I mean, if someone says bad things about William

17

Shakespeare, and the State of California decides that it

18

is going to have a general, floating power to correct

19

speech not connected with the regulatory responsibilities

20

of any agency like the FTC or the -- or the SEC, but a

21

free-floating power to correct speech, we think that would

22

be constitutionally infirm, but in this case, in any

23

event, it doesn't come close to commercial speech.

24
25

QUESTION:

Is your position that, as I

understand it, that even if this action were brought by

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a -- a public agency it would still be impermissible?
MR. TRIBE:

2

In -- in this forum, where the

3

public agency didn't need to allege, was not administering

4

a regulatory program to protect people, I -- I think -QUESTION:

5

Would you say the same thing if, that

6

it would be also impermissible for a public agency to

7

investigate to determine whether or not the statements

8

were true or false?
MR. TRIBE:

9

To have an investigation, no.

I

10

think that the freedom of speech includes the freedom to

11

have public as well as private debate.

12

is about.

13

QUESTION:

That's what this

So that you -- you would agree a

14

public agency could investigate the charges here to

15

determine whether they are true or false.

16

private action, could a private party engage in discovery

17

to find out whether they were true or false?

18

MR. TRIBE:

Could a -- in a

Well, of course, in this case

19

discovery is the name of the game, it would become a

20

massive thing.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.
I think that if we are right that

23

this action dies aborning, if it's like the statute in

24

Cox v. Cohn itself, where it was simply an impermissible

25

thing, and where no trial would cure the problem, then you

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

don't get to that difficulty, but if it's a legitimate

2

trial, if the law were redesigned, very broad discovery

3

might be permissible.
I'm a little worried about reserving some time,

4
5

but I -- I don't want to leave you in mid-air --

6

QUESTION:

7

you won't have any to reserve.

MR. TRIBE:

I will do just that, Mr. Chief

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

15
16
17

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
California has transferred its governmental

18

authority to regulate marketplace communications to anyone

19

and everyone who possesses the price of the filing fee.

20

Unelected, unaccountable private enforcers, uninhibited by

21

established notions of concrete harm or public duty, have

22

the power to advance their own agendas or personal

23

ideological battles by launching complex, burdensome, and

24

expensive litigation.

25

potential for abuse is difficult to overstate.

The in terrorem effect and

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

This case can and should, we submit, be

2

evaluated according to the means used to regulate speech

3

in California, not the content of that speech.

4

and several of the Justices on this Court have explicitly

5

and repeatedly acknowledged that it is exceedingly

6

difficult, if not impossible, to draw bright lines that

7

segregate marketplace speech according to its content into

8

two separate, mutually exclusive hemispheres, commercial

9

and not commercial.

10

array of contexts.

11

creative, and rigid, permanent, constitutional

12

categorization is neither advisable nor necessary.

13

The Court

These issues arise in an infinite
The speakers are imaginative and

If the commercial-noncommercial dichotomy is

14

employed in this case, and in others, either alternative

15

has undesirable consequences.

16

speech -- and this Court has repeatedly stressed that

17

speech in the marketplace of commerce is valuable.

18

valuable to consumers, but either it becomes

19

noncommercial, making it difficult for Government to

20

regulate to protect the integrity of the marketplace, or

21

it then is characterized as commercial, which can open the

22

day -- open the way to regimes such as California's, where

23

anyone with a whim or a grievance and a filing fee can

24

become a Government-licensed censor.

25

QUESTION:

Valuable marketplace

It's

General Olson, do you think that

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress would be able to authorize a scheme of Private

2

Attorney General, for instance, to enforce SEC

3

regulations?

4

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, with

5

respect to concrete harm in connection with specific

6

individuals.

7

that there actually be concrete harm, an individual

8

participating in a transaction.

9

respect to 10(b)(5) -- Rule 10(b)(5), for example, that

10
11

First place, Article III would require that,

This Court has held with

there must be a buyer or seller of security.
QUESTION:

What will happen is, they'll find in

12

5 minutes somebody who bought some Nike shoes who feels

13

the same way, you know, so you'll just have this exact

14

suit with a different plaintiff, possibly, or maybe

15

Mr. Kasky once bought some, for all I know, and -- and so

16

that isn't really going to help, is it?

17

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, it is, Justice Breyer.

It

18

will limit -- first of all it will limit the regulation of

19

marketplace speech to the traditional patterns and the

20

regimes that have existed --

21

QUESTION:

Okay, so in your view, if Mr. Kasky

22

has bought some shoes and is prepared to say, you know, if

23

I hadn't believed their ad and hadn't been deceived, I

24

never would have bought them --

25

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes.

QUESTION:

-- we can go right ahead with this

suit?
GENERAL OLSON:

If -- well, if -- there are

4

other problems with the California statute in terms of its

5

breadth and its vagueness and things of that nature, but

6

the principal problem that we're talking about here, which

7

avoids the problem of saying that everything is either

8

commercial or noncommercial, is that traditionally, for

9

hundreds of years, the -- the private individual who has

10
11

suffered that injury has been able to bring an action.
QUESTION:

And I -- I accept that.

I'm -- you

12

pointed to evils of both the other positions, but the

13

problem that I'm having with the third set of evils, which

14

I think Justice O'Connor expressed --

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

-- is, imagine an ad -- it's really

17

an ad, and it says, our refrigerators are ozone-friendly.

18

The penguins love them, all right.

19

(Laughter.)

20

QUESTION:

And now it turns out they have the

21

worst chemical in there anybody's ever heard of.

22

going to destroy the ozone layer.

23

their teeth, all right.

It's

Now, that ad, I take it either the FTC or a
private person could proceed against.

I would think so.

1

GENERAL OLSON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

If the answer's yes, then we have the

3

problem, which I was going to ask Mr. Tribe, and I -- I

4

need thinking on this, how do you draw a line?

5

draw a line between, this commercial is not a commercial,

6

it's a letter sent to the marketing directors -- I think

7

that's their best one -- and my penguin-friendly ozone

8

commercial?

9

doing it a third way, but how do we stop the private AG,

How do you

How do we draw that line legally, and you're

10

Congress having the right to give the private AG the power

11

to go after my penguins?

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, in the first place,

13

there -- there is the Article III requirement of actual,

14

concrete harm suffered by an individual.

15

hundreds of years of common law tradition with respect to

16

allowing an individual who is the -- who has received in

17

some way a material misrepresentation of fact, which your

18

question presupposes, that -- that causes justifiable

19

reliance in the marketplace and actual harm as a result of

20

that conduct.

21

There are

Now, with respect to whether that individual,

22

who can then recover the damage actually suffered, can go

23

on and then seek some sort of institutional injunctive or

24

equitable relief, the courts over the years, over hundreds

25

of years have developed circumstances under which the

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

remedy in the injunctive suit, or in the equitable action,

2

has to be tailored to the actual harm suffered by the

3

individual.

4

QUESTION:

General Olson, you're saying that

5

schemes other than the one California adopted would

6

probably make much more sense and be more valuable for

7

producing speech, but what -- what principle is it that

8

you rely on to say that California's scheme is bad, just

9

because there might be others that would be much more

10

favorable to the market of speech?

11

GENERAL OLSON:

Our principle, Chief Justice

12

Rehnquist, is that the governmental power to regulate

13

speech in the marketplace, which is constrained by the

14

First Amendment, has been transferred to private citizens

15

without the normal constraints that -- that --

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, what is your best authority so

far as a case from our Court for that proposition?

18

GENERAL OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

20

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, one of the --

Can you answer the question?
The -- well, I think that I have

21

to start with the Gertz case, in which the -- the Supreme

22

Court said in the context of a libel suit there is a

23

governmental interest in protecting individuals from

24

actual injury suffered, but the Court went on in Gertz to

25

say, but that's the limit of the --

27
Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

But when you can pair one share of

2

stock, go into court and say, I -- I want a class action,

3

I'm going to pursue this securities suit, it's -- it's --

4

it goes back to the question Justice Breyer asked.

5

one pair of Nike shoes, I come and say, okay, I'm a

6

customer and I want to sue on behalf of all customers

7

similarly situated.

8

it allows room for that, doesn't really get to the

9

problem.

It seems to me that your solution, if

GENERAL OLSON:

10

I buy

Well, we believe it does,

11

Justice Ginsburg.

12

one share who were misled in the marketplace, or one pair

13

of shoes who had received misleading information, has been

14

actually suffered, eliminates the idea that governmental

15

power is being transferred to people in gross, that the

16

license to be Government, to regulate speech, is just

turned loose to everyone.

Those kind of suits, persons who bought

QUESTION:

These are traditional notions

General Olson, let -- let me just ask

21

you the procedural question, because I found that your

22

argument was very well laid out, but I did not see that

23

that position was taken, and my major concern was that the

24

California official who should speak to this question is

25

not before us, wasn't in this case as far as I know, the

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Attorney General of California.
GENERAL OLSON:

2

Let me answer it this way.

This

3

Court has said in Yee versus Escondido that if the legal

4

argument is embraced within the question actually properly

5

raised, the litigants can make that argument.

It also

6

discussed that same issue in the Lebron case.

This --

QUESTION:

7

Aren't you notified if there's a --

8

if there's a question of the constitutionality of a

9

statute passed by Congress so that you will have the

10

opportunity to come in and tell the Court what your view

11

is?
GENERAL OLSON:

12

That is a requirement, and it's

13

addressed in the appendix in -- in the reply brief and in

14

the appendix to the reply brief filed on behalf of -- of

15

Nike, but it's also important to recognize that this

16

specific point is raised in the -- in the cert petition

17

itself.

18

other features of the California liability scream --

19

scheme aggravate the chilling effect, and then goes on to

20

elaborate on that point by saying, it invests every single

21

California resident with the power of a Private Attorney

General, so --

23

25

On pages 27 and 28 Nike said, made the point,

it is an antecedent question for deciding the First

years.

Now, in these circumstances this Court says --

2

it said in ASARCO the court can still take jurisdiction,

3

but in ASARCO, the State court judgment there established

4

liability and left only questions of what the type of

5

remedy might be.
Here, the State court decision by the California

6
7

Supreme Court effectively overruled Nike's demurrer and

8

remanded the case for litigation and trial.

9

close to ASARCO.

That is not

Nike would have to admit that the

10

statements were false to get anywhere near the judgment in

11

ASARCO, so the first point on ASARCO is, it doesn't even

12

apply.
The Court would have to extend ASARCO to even

13
14

consider the next question, which would be, if the Court

15

did that, whether Nike, which, of course has the burden of

16

proof, has established that because of this decision it

17

will suffer or has suffered an Article III injury.

MR. HOEBER:

has Article III standing, and I'll direct the Court's

4

attention to the reply brief, page 6, and the only -- only

5

factor that Nike points to to show that it has Article III

6

standing is, and I quote, the certain injury Nike

7

confronts from having to defend its speech in this

sufficient to establish Article III standing.

12

It's --

Well, that's one of the issues in the

case.
MR. HOEBER:

Well, all right, then I'll move to

my second jurisdictional point, because I want to make

14

sure it comes out, and this is under Cox, and that is,

15

there is no final judgment because this is a -- in a

16

traditional sense because this is the overruling of a

demurrer, but the fourth exception set forth in Cox

18

provides a way that this Court can hear a case in this

conditions is that were this Court to hear the case and

reverse, that would put an end to the -- to the -- to the

litigation, at least to the relevant cause of action.

noncommercial speech.

16

covers commercial speech, and it's a red herring in that

17

sense, where under us -- that we would lose the course of

18

action and we couldn't proceed, so yes, the court of

19

appeal did finish by saying, we don't see any reasonable

20

possibility that the complaint can be amended to allege

21

noncommercial speech, so that --

22

QUESTION:

Okay, but let's -- let's assume it

23

could be amended in some way.

24

complaint as it is, and if we accept their position, then

25

you cannot go forward with the complaint as it is.

The demurrer is to the

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

You

1

would have to modify your lawsuit by amendment or bring a

2

new one, and why isn't that sufficient for -- for the

3

fourth Cox exception?

4

MR. HOEBER:

Well, it would -- the complaint as

5

it is would not be sufficient, but what Cox says is, for

6

the -- for the fourth exception, that the court's ruling

7

of reversal must be preclusive of further litigation on

8

the cause of action, so we gave the example --

9

QUESTION:

Well, the cause of action as pleaded.

10

I mean, not a cause of action that you might have pleaded,

11

or a different one that you might bring.

12

MR. HOEBER:

Well, it would be the cause -- the

13

cause of action would remain as pleaded.

14

if the court were to -- to say -- and we gave the example

15

of negligence -- the court were to say strict liability

16

is -- is unconstitutional, you must have a -- something

17

more than strict liability, you must have negligence, the

18

cause of action would remain the same as --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HOEBER:

21

QUESTION:

If the court --

Well, I think we're --- as in libel cases --

I think we're playing with words.

22

You simply could not go forward on the cause of action as

23

you stated that cause of action in your pleadings.

24

would have to come forward with a cause of action which is

25

in some respect different in order --

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

You

1

MR. HOEBER:

2

QUESTION:

It would be more burdensome.

-- in order to meet the

3

constitutional objection, and if that is the case, why

4

isn't it sufficient under Cox IV that you could not

5

proceed in the -- in the suit as you have pleaded it and

6

brought it?

7

MR. HOEBER:

Well, we're certainly not going to

8

argue about words, and what -- that is certainly correct,

9

that if -- as pleaded, and -- and we pleaded under the

10

statute it's a -- it's strict liability, and if the Court

11

were to say, you must have negligence, we would amend the

12

complaint to allege negligence, so it is certainly correct

13

that as pleaded we would not be proceeding on an

14

as-pleaded.

15

We would amend the complaint.

What I -- what I'm saying is that as I

16

understand the Cox exception, the point of it is that the

17

Court is saying that we will only take a case under

18

Cox IV, when we know that if we reverse, the case is over

19

on that -- on that cause of action, not the technicality

20

of the pleading so much, but the reality of it, and if we

21

can amend the complain to allege the additional element,

22

it's really the same -- it is the same cause of action.

23

It's just more burdensome.

24
25

QUESTION:

What you're saying is, is that Cox

category has real teeth in it, and that you just can't --

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

you have to show that it's really going to be over.

2

MR. HOEBER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

My -- yes, I --

But one aspect of it is that the

4

demurrer was granted without leave to repeat, as I

5

understand it, was dismissed with prejudice.

6

MR. HOEBER:

Yes.

In -- in San Francisco

7

Superior Court, the trial court, the judge granted the

8

demurrer without leave to amend.

9

and I should say, California law is not the Federal Rules

10
11

Under California law --

of Civil Procedure.
California law is the field code, the updated

12

field code, but it goes back to 1872, in fact to 1850, so

13

under California law, when the -- when the trial judge

14

granted the demurrer without leave to amend, we were

15

entitled to, and we did appeal without seeking leave to

16

amend, and -- and under California law, and I -- I'll say

17

this in response to the statement on page 4 of the reply

18

brief that he makes no -- excuse me, that his abandonment

19

of the claimed right to amend, we did not abandon.

20

Respondent did not abandon any claimed right to amend.

21

Under California law, we are entitled to amend.

22

We didn't abandon it.

I'm not sure how -- how we could

23

abandon it.

24

appealed from the -- from the superior court to the court

25

of appeal.

We felt we were right on the law, and we

The court of appeal ruled against us and said,

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

as I noted earlier, we don't see a possibility of

2

amended -- amending it to noncommercial speech, which we

3

agree with.

4

We appealed to the California Supreme Court

5

because we felt we were right on the law, and the

6

California Supreme Court agreed with us.

7

California Supreme Court had said, you're wrong on the

8

law, you've got to prove negligence, maybe the California

9

Supreme Court would have done that.

10
11

If -- if the

We would have then

amended the complaint and proved negligence.
QUESTION:

You're not going to be able to amend

12

the complaint in respect to at least one argument, which I

13

think is a substantial argument, and that's the argument

14

that this particular statement, whether made to the

15

directors of the marketing, or whoever made it, is a

16

statement that plays a role in a public debate about what

17

kind of society we wish to live in, and it's looking

18

towards action of a legislative sort, an administrative

19

sort, or possibly an interdependent individual sort, like

20

a boycott, and that being a statement that plays that kind

21

of role in a public debate, it is entitled to the highest

22

protection regardless of the forum it appeared in, so

23

California cannot proceed.

24
25

Now, in respect to that kind of an argument,
what's your reply?

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOEBER:

My -- my reply is, number 1, if --

2

if this Court were to say the case is barred, of course we

3

couldn't amend.

4

not -- I don't mean -QUESTION:

5
6
7

We could not amend, but -- so -- I'm

I'm really trying to get you to the

merits.
MR. HOEBER:

Yes, I -- I'm going to -- I'm about

8

to move to the merits.

9

certain -- certainly circumstances we could not amend.

10

I'm -- so yes, there are

Now, on the merits, and in direct response to --

11

to your question, that's not this complaint.

12

this complaint.

13

Nike's briefs that suggest that's this case, and that's

14

this complaint, but the record before this Court is in

15

that complaint, and it's nowhere else.

16

That is not

Maybe there's a lot of statements in

QUESTION:

No, well, they say -- they're saying

17

don't look at -- look at the statement.

It's the

18

statement we're talking about, and look at all their

19

examples, and the statement that Nike gave is

20

characterized, according to them, as I characterized it,

21

so they say, we don't care what it says in the complaint.

22

The complaint apparently would like us, something bad to

23

happen to us as a result of having made this statement.

24

That's enough for us.

25

from that bad thing.

The First Amendment protects us

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOEBER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HOEBER:

Yes, and -- and --

And why doesn't it?
And it doesn't because the

4

statements alleged in the complaint are specific, factual

5

representations that say, we make our products in

6

compliance with the laws of -- of the country of

7

manufacture with respect to wages and overtime, with

8

respect to health and safety, with respect to

9

environmental standards, we pay our workers twice the

10

minimum wage -- they are specific factual statements of

11

that kind.

12

that talk about globalization --

They are not statements that go beyond that,

13

QUESTION:

How is your client hurt by that?

14

MR. HOEBER:

My client is here as -- as a

15

Private Attorney General under the California provisions

16

authorizing --

17

QUESTION:

So he's -- so he's not hurt by it --

18

MR. HOEBER:

So he is not hurt by it.

He has,

19

as I said, no Article III standing.

20

by it.

21

Private Attorney General point, I will -- I will say this,

22

on -- we said in our brief that it was not raised.

23
24
25

He -- he is not hurt

He is a Private Attorney General, and on the

QUESTION:

If he's not hurt by that, how is

anybody in California hurt by that?
MR. HOEBER:

Everybody in California will be

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

hurt by it, or is hurt by it in exactly the same way that,

2

under this complaint as it would be if it had been brought

3

by the California Attorney General or by the Federal Trade

4

Commission.

5

The California statute, apart from the Private

6

Attorney General provision, which is admittedly unusual,

7

maybe unique, but apart from the Private Attorney General

8

provision, the California statute is essentially the same

9

as the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Section 5 of the

10

Federal Trade Commission Act and the California statute

11

have the same standard of liability, which is likely to

12

mislead, or likely to deceive.

13

The Solicitor General's brief sets out the --

14

the standards on the Federal section 5.

15

essentially the same, a claim that is likely to mislead

16

people, that's material, and so under section 5 under the

17

California statute it is not required that -- that the

18

plaintiff come in and prove actual deception, actual

19

injury, actual harm, so it's -- it's precisely the same

20

under either scheme.

21

QUESTION:

They're

May I -- may I interrupt to go back

22

to your article, your final judgment argument for just a

23

moment with respect to this?

24

hold that in a case like this, where you don't have

25

Article III standing, that the case may not go forward

Supposing that we should

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unless the plaintiff can meet the New York Times standard,

2

prove actual malice and gross negligence and all the rest,

3

but it could theoretically go forward if those allegations

4

were made.
My question is, is it your understanding, as a

5
6

matter of California law and as a matter of the history of

7

this case, that you would have the right to -- to file an

8

amendment to your complaint making those allegations?
MR. HOEBER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

Well, then, if that's true, is it

11

clear the case is not final, the judgment of law is not

12

final?
MR. HOEBER:

13
14

Well, on the -- on the same grounds

I said before, we -- if the court were to add an -QUESTION:

15

It would be only if we were to hold

16

that no matter what you allege, New York Times or anything

17

else, these statements are constitutionally immune from

18

criticism in a proceeding of this kind.

19

would the case really be final, if we held that.
MR. HOEBER:

20

Well, the case would certainly be

21

final if the Court held that.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HOEBER:

24
25

Only in that case

Yes.
We would not be able to amend the

case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOEBER:

It would be over.

2

On the Private Attorney General, because it is

3

an unusual provision, I will only say this on -- on the

4

question whether it was raised below.

5

we said in our brief it was not raised below.

That is an

6

easy matter to settle.

They filed

7

the brief in the California Supreme Court.

8
9

QUESTION:
raised below.

That's an easy --

Nike filed the brief.

It's their --

Well, what -- what if it weren't

I mean, if a basic First Amendment

10

challenge to the statute is raised below, I mean, if you

11

lose in the Supreme Court of California you're certainly

12

not just going to repeat exactly the same arguments.

13

You're going to think up some new ones.

14

MR. HOEBER:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. HOEBER:

Well --

I will only say as a matter of fact

17

it was not raised below.

18

not address it.

19

can look at pages 8, 9, and 19 to 23, and they've got a

20

different argument.

21

The California Supreme Court did

It's not even in the cert petition.

It's not there.

That's the fact.

The upshot of not raising it below, I'm assuming

22

the Court doesn't address arguments that were not

23

raised below.

24
25

You

QUESTION:

Well, the Escondido case says there's

some latitude there.

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOEBER:

And I -- and I -- I'm aware there's

2

latitude, and there's -- there's latitude as to what's an

3

argument and what's a claim, but this is a very specific

4

argument that the Private Attorney General provision is

5

unconstitutional.

6

QUESTION:

Is it -- is it correct that in the

7

court below they did raise the point that, in fact, there

8

was no harm here, and one of the defects of the procedure

9

was that no one, either suing, or no one of the class on

10

behalf of whom suit was brought had or was alleged to have

11

had suffered any injury?

12

wasn't it?

13
14

MR. HOEBER:
that argument.

That was in their argument,

Not that I recall.

I don't recall

The --

15

QUESTION:

If it was, would that be enough?

16

MR. HOEBER:

Well, it -- it certainly would not

17

raise to my mind an attack on the Private Attorney General

18

provision, but I mean, the Private Attorney General

19

provision is a well-known and well -- and well-understood

20

provision that stands out, and to -- to attack it, I think

21

you have to mention it.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, if -- the -- the

23

argument is not merely that there is something magically

24

wrong with a Private Attorney General.

25

that what's wrong with a Private Attorney General is that

The argument is

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

without public accountability, the Attorney General can

2

sue without, in effect, showing any harm, so whether you

3

use the term or not, that's the guts of the argument, and

4

if they raise the guts below, isn't that enough to -- to

5

get them into court?

6
7

MR. HOEBER:
would be enough.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOEBER:

10

If they raised the guts below, it

Yes.
I -- I guess I would say they

didn't raise the guts below.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MR. HOEBER:

13

QUESTION:

But if they did, yes, I --

I would think out in California if a

14

litigant is challenging a statute as unconstitutional in

15

every instance, that you cannot have such an institution

16

of a Private Attorney General, doesn't the Attorney

17

General weigh in on those cases?

18

MR. HOEBER:

Yes.

The Attorney -- the Attorney

19

General in California under this statute, and it's not

20

just for the Private Attorney General, but under the --

21

the false advertising and -- and unfair competition

22

statute, any time a -- a case gets on appeal the Attorney

23

General gets served with the briefs, so when we appealed

24

in the first instance we served the Attorney General with

25

our briefs, and we -- in the court of appeal and again in

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the California Supreme Court, and the Attorney General

2

came in and filed an amicus brief in the California

3

Supreme Court on our behalf, which of course only related

4

to the merits, the commercial speech issue, which was the

5

issue we were litigating.
QUESTION:

6
7

Not on the issue of whether you could

have --

8

MR. HOEBER:

9

QUESTION:

No.

-- this kind of animal.

10

MR. HOEBER:

No.

No.

No.

11

I want to draw the Court's attention to -- to

12

footnote 3 in the reply brief.

13

some matters, and -- and in particular the phrase in -- in

14

footnote 3 that says, public agencies.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HOEBER:

17
18

I think this may clarify

What page is that on?
I'm sorry, it's page 3, footnote 3,

and the reference to public agencies.
The argument that -- that the Private Attorney

19

General provision is unconstitutional because we don't

20

have any injury, and allege no injury, and it's -- and

21

it's unconstitutional, the result of that argument is that

22

respondent is an improper plaintiff, is just -- doesn't --

23

doesn't meet constitutional requirements as an improper

24

plaintiff.

25

If the Court were to hold that, then there are

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

no further issues for this Court, and that is why I

2

direct -- I focus on footnote 3, because in footnote 3, as

3

I -- as I read it, Nike is saying that even if the Court

4

holds that the Private Attorney General provision is

5

unconstitutional because the plaintiff has no injury,

6

nevertheless the Court should go on because there will be

7

future lawsuits filed by public agencies, and the Court

8

should go on to impose a scienter requirement deliberate

9

or reckless falsehood.

10

And I want to say that those public agencies,

11

which is another word for law enforcement, which would be

12

California Attorney General, the district attorneys, and

13

not only California, other States and the FTC, they are

14

not before the Court.

15

Court.

16

If -- if respondent is an improper plaintiff, there aren't

17

any further issues, and we can't --

Those parties are not before the

I don't think we can represent those parties.

18

QUESTION:

Can I --

19

QUESTION:

Well, you try to have it both ways.

20

You say, well I'm here because I'm a Private Attorney

21

General, but I -- I can't really try this case as well as

22

an Attorney General could.

23

MR. HOEBER:

25

MR. HOEBER:

Well, no -- no --

That seems to me quite inconsistent.

merits of this case and -- and get away from the Private

3

Attorney General, if the Private Attorney General is

4

constitutional, then respondent is in the same shoes as

5

the Federal Trade Commission or the California Attorney

6

General, and that as far as the merits, go there is no

7

difference.

8
9
10

I want to say that -- that if we turn to the

I said earlier that the California statute,
statutory scheme is the same as section 5.
QUESTION:

Well, I accept that.

I want to get

11

you just back once more if I can, and you may have nothing

12

to add, but I -- suppose we have to get to what I find in

13

this case personally the hardest question, I think that

14

the Federal Trade Commission certainly has the right to

15

regulate unfair, deceptive advertising, particularly on

16

matters of -- of, that you're trying to sell the product,

17

including those having to do with, say, the environment.

18

I also think that the First Amendment is

19

designed to protect all participants in a public debate,

20

and public debates, contrary, in my mind, to what you said

21

before, are made up of factual statements, primarily, so

22

once you tie a party's hands behind his back in respect to

23

facts, you've silenced him.

24
25

Now, if all parties should participate equally
under the First Amendment, and also you should be able to

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have regulation by the FTC of deceptive advertising, how

2

do I draw that line?

3

MR. HOEBER:

Well, in this case, the reason I

4

say -- and I'm not trying to carve out facts as different

5

from, necessarily different from anything else.

6

here were representations about the conditions under which

7

the product was made.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOEBER:

The facts

I know, and I think --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HOEBER:

12

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, those --

Now, but that's not going to help me.
I'm sorry.

What I'm really looking for is help

13

in writing a hypothetical opinion.

14

standard, or a rule, or a statement, and I know that

15

30 briefs here, which are excellent, have tried to get at

16

that, but I'm still in my mind uncertain about, say, your

17

view or the others on what that sentence should say,

18

trying to distinguish the ones from the others.

19

MR. HOEBER:

I have to write a

Well, this case, and I -- and I'll

20

start with a focus here, the -- the debate in this case

21

that's in the complaint, and the only debate that's in the

22

complaint, is the debate over what, in fact, was going on

23

in the shoe factories, what in fact, were the conditions.

24

That was the debate.

25

Now, that debate is not the same as a public

50

1

debate about a larger public issue.

Amendment purposes?

But is -- is it different for First

MR. HOEBER:

5

It is a debate about

Well, I think -- I think it has to

6

be, Your Honor, because the -- the company is making

7

representations to consumers about its own practices for

8

the purpose of convincing those consumers that they should

9

buy the company's products, so it is commercial speech in

10

that sense.

11

QUESTION:

Whereas if it --

12

MR. HOEBER:

13

QUESTION:

It is not -- it is not a --

Whereas if it were about

14

globalization and what is happening in these countries it

15

would be different for First Amendment purposes?
MR. HOEBER:

16

Yes.

It would not be about the

17

company's -- this -- these statements are about the

18

company's products, the conditions under which the

19

products are made.

and it's false or misleading, it's not protected by the

First Amendment.

I -- I --

QUESTION:

6

MR. HOEBER:

7

It's also true that false factual

statements have no constitutional -QUESTION:

8
9

Yes.

No, but I mean, even if it's not

commercial speech, if somebody misleads me, to my

10

detriment, with a false statement, I wouldn't have a cause

11

of action?
MR. HOEBER:

12

Yes, you would have a cause of

13

action.

You would certainly have a cause of action,

14

and -- and if I sold you a watch and told you it was made

15

in the United States and you relied on that and bought it

16

from me and I lied, or -- or even if I innocently told you

17

that, you could rescind the transaction.
QUESTION:

18

Is -- is the only way I can rely to

19

my detriment is if -- if it is commercial speech?

20

it seems to me if I rely on a -- on a statement that --

21

that the person expects me to rely on, and I do so, and it

22

harms me, I have a cause of action.

noncommercial speech?

MR. HOEBER:

I suspect it does not, for a -- for

a cause of action alleging reliance to my detriment and -QUESTION:

Can you think of any case that this

5

Court has decided in which the outcome has depended on

6

whether or not the speech was commercial, other than the

7

case the California Supreme Court decided?

8
9

MR. HOEBER:

There -- there is a paucity of

authority from this Court that was --

10

QUESTION:

I wonder if there's any at all.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. HOEBER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOEBER:

15

The case that -- that was most important, and

16

this maybe gets back to Justice Breyer's point, for our

17

purposes would be the Egg Commission case -- the Egg

18

Commission case, the National Commission on Egg Nutrition,

19

because there was a product and there were attacks on the

20

product saying it caused -- that the cholesterol was bad,

21

and this is 25 years ago, and it was new, and -- and the

22

Federal Trade -- and the egg industry fought back and said

23

no, eggs -- eggs are helpful in nutrition, and -- and they

24

don't harm, so that was a case where you had a dispute, or

25

a debate about the product.

-- directly on point.

Yes.
No.

1

QUESTION:

Yes, but where I am really is, I -- I

2

think it's possible to look at the commercial speech cases

3

as creating a doctrine with an exception, and it's the

4

unfair advertising that falls outside the doctrine, so all

5

we know is, we're back to square 1 as far as the

6

commercial speech doctrine is concerned, so let's face it

7

as if there were no such doctrine and try to figure out

8

how under the First Amendment we get proper standards.

9
10

MR. HOEBER:
QUESTION:

And that -- and that's what I'm

11

trying to figure out.

12

MR. HOEBER:

13
14

Well --

Well, I -- yes.

If -- if the Court

wants to do that in this case, on this record -QUESTION:

I mean, I don't know if we want to do

I'm trying to figure out what -- how to

15

it or not do it.

16

go about it if I ended up thinking we should go about it.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. HOEBER:

Then -- then my suggestion is that

19

this case alleges specific representations about a -- a

20

company's products, namely the conditions under which they

21

were made.

22

Solicitor General agrees with that.

23

representations, and they rely on them in making decisions

24

as to whether or not to buy the company's products.

25

Consumers rely on those representations.

The

They rely on those

When companies make representations about their

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

products with the purpose of consumers relying on those

2

representations, and consumers do rely on those

3

representations, it violates section 5 of the Federal

4

Trade Commission Act, it violates the California statute,

5

and it ought to be subject to regulation.

6

QUESTION:

Well, just becomes something

7

violates -- you're suggesting that if it -- if it's

8

contrary to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,

9

surely it must be constitutional, but I'm not sure -- I

10

don't know that we've ever said that everything in the

11

Federal Trade Commission Act is constitutional.

12
13

MR. HOEBER:

No, I'm sure the Court has not said

that, and I -- and I'm -- and I --

14

QUESTION:

Let's --

15

QUESTION:

Go on.

16

QUESTION:

Let's assume a -- a law that --

17

that -- I -- I guess that -- that there were, that -- that

18

requires advertising on radio or television to be

19

supported, that you -- you cannot make the claim unless

20

the claim is supported, all right, and the burden is on

21

you to have the support before you can even make it, and

22

it's a violation, even -- even if it happens to be true,

23

if -- if you have not done the studies that show that this

24

little pill does this thing or -- or another, you cannot

25

make the statement.

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, I suppose we would allow that in -- in

2

advertising, wouldn't we?

3

such a precondition to -- to speech in -- in a

4

noncommercial area?

5

MR. HOEBER:

6

QUESTION:

But would we allow such a --

I'm sure -- I suspect not.

So there is a difference between what

7

we're willing to do with commercial speech and

8

noncommercial speech, but why -- why wouldn't we limit it,

9

limit the term commercial speech in that context to

10

advertising, to really -- and -- and some of our cases

11

speak that way.

12

of a -- of a transaction, the offering of a deal.

13

It has to be the context of the offering

So that if you have some general, you know,

14

advertising on television, we're a -- we're a -- an

15

environmentally concerned company, it doesn't fall within

16

commercial speech.

17

know, on the -- on the label it says, buy this because, or

18

you know, it's a pitch to sell the product.

19
20
21

It's only if in connection -- you

Isn't that a line that it's feasible to draw,
and why isn't that a sensible line?
MR. HOEBER:

Well, it may be feasible to draw.

22

I -- I imagine it would be difficult to draw, and I think

23

that's why the Federal Trade Commission says advertising,

24

product labels, other promotions and marketing material,

25

because it in many instances is not easy to draw --

QUESTION:

Well, the California Supreme Court

2

defined commercial speech as speech when a person is

3

engaged in commerce.
MR. HOEBER:

4
5

Oh, I think the California Supreme

Court was trying to spell out what it -- what it -QUESTION:

6
7

Just generally, is that their basis?

Do you defend the California Supreme

Court's --

8

MR. HOEBER:

9

QUESTION:

-- definition?

MR. HOEBER:

10

Well --

We don't need to go as far as the

11

California Supreme Court may have gone, in particular with

12

its definition of product references, because I think the

13

California Supreme Court was concerned about so-called

14

image advertising and the possible ways companies promote

15

themselves apart from this particular product.
QUESTION:

16

Well, if it -- if this case -- if we

17

reach the merits, and if we have to address it, we're

18

going to have to know what commercial speech is, I

19

suppose.

20

MR. HOEBER:

21

QUESTION:

22

And we're going to have to look at

California's definition.

23

MR. HOEBER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

Yes.

And I just wondered if you supported

that.

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOEBER:

Well, we support it, but we don't

2

have to go as far, because in this -- because we have

3

representations about the product, the -- the

4

circumstances under which the product was made.

5

We certainly agree that --

6

QUESTION:

7

in the true sense of that term, was it?
MR. HOEBER:

8
9

None of this speech was advertising

Well, if the true sense means

advertising format, no, these were not in advertising

10

format, but for example, the -- the -- one of the exhibits

11

is the -- is a primer, a 30-page primer, which looks for

12

all the world like the kind of promotional brochures and

13

marketing material that's handed out by lots of companies.
Now, it's not an advertisement on television,

14
15

and -- and that line may be feasible to draw, or it may --

16

may have fuzzy edges, but it's going to leave out a lot of

17

promotions and a lot of communications that consumers rely

18

on.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. HOEBER:

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

No.

It's not a perfect world.
No.

But it's worse -- it's worse,

23

actually, because I think your case, the truth of the

24

matter is, I think it's both.

25

They're both trying to sell their product and they're

Well, my -- my position is that

Yes.
-- but -- but the hypothetical is,

it's both.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, that's right.

16

MR. HOEBER:

And -- and if it were just the --

17

if it was -- if it was -- companies -- the Court has said

18

that companies have the right, or speakers have the right

19

to comment directly on public issues, and -- and if you

20

comment directly on a public issue and discuss the public

21

issue, you are certainly protected.

22

QUESTION:

If it's very difficult to define

23

commercial speech, then isn't it true that under this

24

scheme companies are chilled in speaking?

25

MR. HOEBER:

Well, they -- they may be chilled

59
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

in speaking if -- because of the difficulty in defining

2

commercial speech, and that presumably will chill false

3

statements as well, since the -- the statute and the

4

regulation only applies to false or misleading speech,

5

and -- and I think that to the extent the -- the

6

definition is -- is unclear, it may -- I don't know that

7

for a fact, but it's -- it's plausible.
QUESTION:

8
9

Are -- are there cases where we've

upheld statutes that are chilling of speech?

MR. HOEBER:

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

MR. HOEBER:

QUESTION:

15

Well --

We haven't said that they're chilling

of speech.
(Laughter.)

MR. HOEBER:

19

Yes, there are.

What are they?

16

18

Oh yes.

I think you caught me there, Your

Honor.
On -- back to -- to Justice Breyer's question.

20

I don't think anybody would say defining commercial speech

21

is easy, but in this case, where we allege that -- where

22

the complaint alleges that the company made factual

23

representations about its -- the circumstances under which

24

its products are made, with the purpose of persuading

25

consumers to buy the product, and we know that consumers

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

want that information and rely on that information, that

2

should fit within any reasonable definition of commercial

speech.

If -QUESTION:

4

Are you saying that you can't

distinguish what you are targeting from, say, a label that

6

says, made by disabled veterans, when it wasn't?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

Let me just deal with a couple of technical

18

things first.

The Attorney General of California was

19

notified below.

20

California that all of the arguments be rehearsed before

21

him, and most importantly the California Supreme Court

22

passed on the fundamental claim that this scheme, applied

23

to public debate, violates the First Amendment, and under

24

Yee v. Escondido in any event we can make a different

25

argument.

He filed a brief.

It's not required in

But if you look at the brief below, the most

2

telling part of it, I think -- and it gets to the pivot of

3

this case -- this is at pages 30 to 31 of the California

4

Supreme Court brief.

5

as it were, were on the other foot, under California law

6

this case would go away in an instant.

It there recites that if the shoe,

The

The trial court was about to

It seems to me that what we have here, and this

20

goes to the question of the Private Attorney General

21

action, is that if there is a debate between interests of

22

labor and interests of management, the California Supreme

23

Court has transmogrified this old statute, which was

24

pretty strange to begin with but had never been used to

25

stifle and silence the public debate, it's transformed it

62
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

into a conversation-stopper, and the power to do that is,

2

I think, extraordinary.

3

They say, maybe there will be a chill.

If you

look at the media brief, the media are now saying that

5

businesses around the world are already afraid to

7

the European brief, filed by a consortium that controls

8

about $2 trillion of investment, says that the efforts of

9

the European Union to encourage transparency are being

10

frustrated by California saying that if you come out and

11

answer these charges, as they did in the letter to the

12

athletic directors, you can be trapped, because you're a

13

business, so you're trying to make money, so it's

commercial speech.
