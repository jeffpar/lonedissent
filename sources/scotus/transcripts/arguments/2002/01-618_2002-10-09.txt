ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. LESSIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Petitioners are before you this morning

10
11

challenging Congress's 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term

12

Extension Act, which extended the term of subsisting and

13

future copyrights by 20 years.

14

blanket extension of existing terms exceeds Congress's

15

power under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First

16

Amendment.

Petitioners submit such a

17

Now, the Government has responded to

18

petitioners' argument in a way that betrays a simple but

19

fundamental confusion.

20

petitioners had advanced a general theory of the Copyright

21

Clause, or a general constraint under which Congress must

22

operate.

23

an enumerated power.

24

Congress to exercise its copyright authority.

25

have advanced a particular interpretation of the only

The Government has argued as if

That is a mistake.

This case is about limits to

1

express limits in the Copyright Clause designed to give

2

those limits meaning.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Lessig, I'll tell you what

4

bothers me about your position, and that is that Congress

5

has extended the term so often through the years, and if

6

you are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous

7

extensions of time?

8

that began with the very first act.

I mean, this seems to be a practice

MR. LESSIG:

9

Justice, we do not believe that the

10

very first act extended terms at all.

11

technically, which for a lawyer means speaking accurately,

12

the 1790 act did not extend a Federal term.

13

granted a term for works that already existed in precisely

14

the pattern that the English parliament had done in the

15

Statute of Anne in 1710, and that the English parliament

16

did with monopolies, general monopolies in the statute

17

of -QUESTION:

18
19

extensions since.
MR. LESSIG:

21

QUESTION:

23

The 1790 act

But there have been a number of

20

22

Speaking

That's right.

Even if you can get over the first

hurdle.
MR. LESSIG:

That's right.

That's the important

24

hurdle, and we'd like to jump that first, but the other

25

ones, Justice, you're right, in 1831 and in 1909 Congress

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the

2

strongest form of the test that we have advanced.

3

extensions, however, were never challenged in any court

4

and certainly not considered by this Court.

5

QUESTION:

Those

Well, doesn't that itself mean

6

something, Mr. Lessig?

7

challenged, perhaps most people, and perhaps everybody

8

felt there was no basis for challenging them.

9

MR. LESSIG:

The fact that they were never

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

10

absolutely true that this case is here because of a

11

fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes

12

the Framers' limitations on the Copyright Clause much more

13

significant.

14

this Court has been pointed to changed circumstances as a

15

reason to reaffirm the Framers' values, because for most

16

of this period, Mr. Chief Justice, the only people who

17

were regulated by copyright law under the Copyright Act

18

would have been commercial publishers, primarily, and now

19

for the first time the scope of this exclusive right has

20

expanded because of the changed technology of the Internet

21

to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity that

22

never would have been imagined before.

23

This is the first time I can remember where

Now, it's not the case that the earlier

24

extensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds.

25

In fact, Melville Nimmer, in the consideration of the 1976

act, suggested they were plainly under -QUESTION:

Well, I'm talking about court

challenges, not academic challenges.
MR. LESSIG:

That's right, there is no court

challenge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lessig, your theory, as I

7

understand it, regardless of changed circumstances or not,

8

your basic theory, which on your argument would have been

9

appropriate at any time historically, is that there has at

10

least got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal

11

connection between the extension and the promotion or

12

inducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but

13

why is that any more plausible a reading of the Promotion

14

Clause than simply a reading that says the Promotion

15

Clause requires that there be a general scheme in place,

16

which overall tends to promote or induce, and part of one

17

aspect of that scheme can be that the -- that at the

18

discretion of Congress the period of protection is

19

extended from time to time?

20

Why do you require -- why do you say the clause has

21

got to be read by this kind of specific causation theory

22

as opposed to a kind of systemic theory of promotion?

23

MR. LESSIG:

Justice Souter, the reason is

24

exactly related to the point I began with, that this is a

25

case about limits and not about discretion.

If it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the case that this Court -QUESTION:

2
3

No, but that's -- I mean, that's the

issue in the alternative reading.

4

MR. LESSIG:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's right.

And why is it a limit case, rather

than a discretion within a general scheme kind --

7

MR. LESSIG:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LESSIG:

That's right.

-- of clause?
Because if this Court does not

10

adopt a reading of the form we've offered, then there is

11

no limit to the ability of Congress to extend subsisting

12

terms.
QUESTION:

13

Do you say the same thing for scope?

14

This case is about duration, but Congress from time to

15

time -- in fact, you mentioned --

16

MR. LESSIG:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- the expanded applications of

18

copyright, and Congress itself extends the scope from time

19

to time.

20

MR. LESSIG:

21

QUESTION:

That's right.

Would you make, as far as, say,

22

translation rights that didn't exist before, the same

23

argument?

24

MR. LESSIG:

25

QUESTION:

I --

Why -- or -- and if you wouldn't, why

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not?
MR. LESSIG:

2

I -- no, Justice Ginsburg, we would

3

not, and the reason is again related to the method we have

4

adopted to interpret "limited times."

5

that "promote the progress of science" is a general and

6

independent constraint on the Copyright Clause authority.

7

We've said it must be looked to to interpret the scope of

8

"limited times," and unless retrospective extensions are

9

forbidden, it will eviscerate the meaning of "limited

We have not said

10

times."

11

of exclusive right, nor in the context of the power to

12

secure.

13

That does not occur in the context of the scope

If that's -QUESTION:

Could we then go back to Justice

14

O'Connor's question?

15

agree with you, does that mean that we would, in

16

principle, have to hold the 1976 extension

17

unconstitutional?

plus 50 years.

20

21

theory, how could the former not be?

22

is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous.

23

To make that very specific, if we

I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the

And if the former

Justice Breyer, under our theory as

we've advanced it, you're right; the 1976 act would be

unconstitutional.

Whether this Court would apply such a

holding in this case to that act is a question that would

2

have to be resolved under the retrospective --

3
4

QUESTION:
theory, then.

Maybe we ought to find another

Is there any --

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. LESSIG:

Justice, the theory, which would

7

advance the aim of limiting times in a way that is

8

enforceable, is only applicable in the case that we

9

brought before you here to the '98 act, and would not

10

necessarily be applicable under the '76 act for the

11

reasons the Government has offered.

12

this argument, but the Government has offered an argument

13

in a parallel case that suggests a distinction between the

14

'76 act and this case.

15

It's been grounded in their claim that the treaty power

16

creates some special power.

17

claim, but the point is there are a number of issues that

18

the '76 act --

19

QUESTION:

We would not advance

That's not been briefed here.

We wouldn't advance that

In essence, you think it's at least

20

arguable that the '76 act had various positive aspects to

21

it in terms of the purpose of the Copyright Clause that

22

this act lacks?

23

MR. LESSIG:

That's certainly true, and we also

24

believe that, for the reasons averted to by amicus AOL in

25

this case and the reasons you've just suggested, the

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases

2

Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient

3

to fit it within the, quote, "severe disruption exception"

4

to the retrospectivity.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I suppose implicit in the

6

argument that the '76 act, too, should have been declared

7

void, and that we might leave it alone because of the

8

disruption, is that for all these years the act has

9

impeded progress in science and the useful arts.

10

I just

don't see any empirical evidence for that.
MR. LESSIG:

11

Justice, we are not making an

12

empirical claim at all.

13

claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding

14

progress.

15

limit necessary to assure that what would be an

16

effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the

17

copyright laws.

18

Nothing in our Copyright Clause

Our only argument is, this is a structural

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps I misunderstood.

I

19

thought the whole thrust of your argument was that there

20

is a great First Amendment force here that's being

21

silenced, that's being thwarted.

22

MR. LESSIG:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Well, the thrust certainly --

I thought that's the whole

underpinning of your case.
MR. LESSIG:

It's certainly the case that we are

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

asserting, in light of the changed circumstances, that the

2

opportunity to build upon works within the public domain

3

is a fundamental First Amendment interest, and that the

4

First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of

5

this case, is that the public domain be permitted as a

6

source for cultivating work about our culture without

7

unnecessary legal restriction.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, but you want more than that.

You want the right to copy verbatim other people's books,
don't you?
MR. LESSIG:

11

We want the right to copy verbatim

12

works that should be in the public domain and would be in

13

the public domain but for a statute that cannot be

14

justified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under

15

a proper reading of the limits built into the Copyright

16

Clause.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Lessig, on your First Amendment

18

argument I don't see where the retroactivity-prospectivity

19

comes in, because -- I follow your argument under the

20

Copyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is

21

too long, the public domain should get this stuff sooner

22

rather than later, would you explain to me how your

23

prospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First

24

Amendment claim?

25

MR. LESSIG:

Justice, we've argued that it would

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be inappropriate in this case for the Court to consider

2

the prospective line until they decide whether the case,

3

whether the prospective and retrospective is severable,

4

and we submit it's an easy case to show that it's not.

5

QUESTION:

On the First Amendment --

6

MR. LESSIG:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- argument you're making that as, I

8

take it, an argument independent of, it doesn't hang on

9

your Copyright Clause argument.

10

MR. LESSIG:

11

QUESTION:

That's right.

I --

And so let's just take -- let's say

12

that was your only argument in this case.

13

tie into a retrospective-prospective distinction?

14

MR. LESSIG:

How does that

Well, the strongest First Amendment

15

argument is about the retrospective extension, because of

16

a fundamental change that occurs when Congress extends

17

subsisting copyrights, rather than when Congress

18

legislates prospectively.

19

When Congress legislates prospectively, it has

20

no way to know who's going to benefit from its extension.

21

It is simply evaluating what the term should be

22

prospectively in a way that we presume this Court should

23

presume is legitimate under the First Amendment.

24

legislates retrospectively, it is, in effect, looking at

25

particular authors and estates of authors who are before

When it

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress asking for this extension, and it's choosing

2

between these particular authors and the public at large.

3

Now, it may be that in exercising that choice in

4

this case, Congress made an objective valuation of who

5

would be in the best position to advance the interests of

6

promoting the progress of science, or any original --

7

QUESTION:

But you -- under your intermediate

8

scrutiny test we would not be hypothesizing what might

9

have been in Congress's mind.

Your First Amendment test

10

is a stringent one.

11

purpose, and the means that you use is necessarily tied to

12

that purpose.

13

you make the retroactive-prospective line work.

14

You have to have an important

If you take that position, I don't see how

MR. LESSIG:

Well, the line comes from deciding

15

what the First Amendment interest is, and if this Court

16

heed the First Amendment interest off of this difference

17

between selecting who gets the benefit of 20 years of

18

extension and just simply legislating in a general way

19

prospectively, then this Court could hold, with respect to

20

the prospective, that it's not even necessary to raise the

21

intermediate scrutiny in that context, but again, for

22

Ashwander reasons we don't think that this Court should

23

address the prospective aspect of the CTEA even under the

24

First Amendment.

25

QUESTION:

Even though Congress's pattern has

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been to treat all authors equally?

2

that it's been prospective and retrospective is that

3

people should be, people who hold copyrights should be

4

subject to the same regime and not have some people who

5

got their copyrights the week before the law passed

6

treated differently than people who got it the week after.

7

MR. LESSIG:

I mean, the reason

Well, Justice, that certainly is

8

the reason the Government offers for this pattern.

9

course, doesn't explain actually what Congress has done

10

and, even in this case, when a work has passed into the

11

public domain, then there is precisely the same

12

week before/week after problem that you advert to, that

13

extension does not extend to all subsisting works, it only

14

extends to all subsisting copyrights.

15

already drawn in the practice that Congress has adopted,

16

but our point is, the only way to assure --

17

QUESTION:

It, of

So that line is

But Congress has -- or, you're not

18

disputing that Congress has always made these extensions,

19

both retroactive and prospective?

20

MR. LESSIG:

Well, in 1831 it did not.

In 1831

21

it granted the benefit of its extension to a subset of all

22

subsisting copyright holders.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LESSIG:

25

QUESTION:

Let's stick with 1976.
In 1976 --

Because that was what you said --

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's -- the pattern under the CTEA is identical to the

2

one in the '76 act.
MR. LESSIG:

3

That's absolutely right, yes.

So

4

they have extended it to both.

5

unless this Court draws a line about this extension, then

6

for the reasons Judge Sentelle suggested below, there will

7

be no limit to Congress's ability to -QUESTION:

8

But our argument is,

Judge Sentelle did not deal with the

9

First Amendment, as far as I --

10

MR. LESSIG:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LESSIG:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.

-- recall.
That's right.

And so I'm asking you -- perhaps I'm

14

missing it.

I haven't seen where you get the

15

prospective-retrospective in connection with your First

16

Amendment.

17

years is an unreasonable -- is not necessary.

It seems that you're just saying there that 70

18

MR. LESSIG:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes.

And it doesn't serve an important

purpose.
MR. LESSIG:

Yes.

Precisely -- actually, we're

22

not saying anything about the 70 years in this case even

23

under the First Amendment, because we believe it's

24

unseverable, but --

25

QUESTION:

But I thought you were saying that if

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a

2

way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its

3

important interest and important objective when you get to

4

the First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis.

5

Whereas if you don't accept the Copyright Clause claim,

6

then, in order to make the First Amendment analysis we've

7

simply got to say, well, gee, is the promotion of useful

8

art and so on more important than the public domain, and

9

can we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years

10
11

and 70 years?
We're pretty much at sea, so I thought your

12

Copyright Clause argument was necessary to give us some

13

handle with which to deal with the First Amendment.

14

MR. LESSIG:

Our Copyright Clause argument is

15

certainly a way of framing why extensions of subsisting

16

terms cannot be seen to promote the First Amendment

17

interest of speech at all.

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's assume we don't -- for

19

the sake of argument here, let's assume we don't accept

20

the Copyright Clause argument.

21

First Amendment argument in your brief?

22

MR. LESSIG:

23

QUESTION:

Do you have an independent

Yes, of course we do.

Okay, and it is -- tell me in a

24

sentence or two what it is.

25

where Justice Ginsburg is.

I mean, at that point I'm

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LESSIG:

Yes.

The First Amendment argument

2

we've argued in our brief is with respect to the

3

retrospective extension, and the First Amendment argument

4

is, that needs to -QUESTION:

5

No, but that's the Copyright Clause

6

argument, and it seems to me you're saying, okay, we then

7

apply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows us to

8

make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument.
If we don't accept the Copyright Clause

9
10

retrospectivity argument --

11

MR. LESSIG:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Yes.

-- then what is your First Amendment

argument?
MR. LESSIG:

That's right, I'm sorry, Justice.

15

What I'm saying is not that it's the retrospectivity that

16

makes the First Amendment argument troubling -- I mean,

17

that drives our First Amendment argument.

18

is, we have addressed the retrospective portion of CTEA,

19

and so I'm saying in the retrospective portion of CTEA you

20

would apply ordinary, intermediate First Amendment review,

21

and you would ask --

22

QUESTION:

All I'm saying

Well, this Court really has not -- if

23

you say that the Copyright Clause is not violated, I don't

24

think there are examples where this Court has then

25

resorted to First Amendment analysis to invalidate the

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

same act.

2

MR. LESSIG:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well --

I mean, this would be quite a new

proposition.
MR. LESSIG:

Well, Justice O'Connor, the First

6

Amendment is always an independent limitation on what

7

otherwise would be legitimate exercises of congressional

8

authority, so this --

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Framers seem to have

adopted these two things at the same time --

MR. LESSIG:

QUESTION:

That's right.

-- in effect.
That's right, and if --

And I think there are not examples

15

that I can think of where we have said, well, we'll

16

analyze it under the Copyright Clause, but if that

17

fails we'll turn to the First Amendment.

18

MR. LESSIG:

Justice, that's right.

If only we

19

had the Framers' copyright before us, because of course,

20

again remember,the exclusive right the Framers spoke of

21

was the right to print and publish.

22

derivative rights, it didn't include the display rights,

23

and it certainly --

24

QUESTION:

25

Right.

It didn't include the

It has expanded very much,

and they also envisioned a very short term, and I can find

1

a lot of fault with what Congress did here --

2

MR. LESSIG:

3

QUESTION:

That's right.

-- because it does take a lot of

4

things out of the public domain that one would think that

5

someone in Congress would want to think hard about.

6

MR. LESSIG:

7

QUESTION:

That's right.

But having done that, it's very

8

difficult to find the basis in the Constitution for saying

9

it isn't a limited term.

10

It's longer than one might think

desirable --

11

MR. LESSIG:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LESSIG:

Right.

-- but is it not limited?
Well, if it is limited, then there

14

is no limit to the ability of Congress to extend

15

subsisting terms, and that fundamentally destroys the

16

objective that the --

17
18

QUESTION:

The rule against perpetuities might

jump in there at some point.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. LESSIG:

Right, and we submit the Framers

21

had something very different in mind than the rule against

22

perpetuities.

23

there is no limit to the ability to extend terms, and that

24

is precisely contrary to what the Framers had in mind when

25

they worried about this problem originally.

The point is, if this is permitted, then

2

What was the problem they were solving?

It was,

as this Court stated in Graham -QUESTION:

3

Well, I could agree with you, in

4

terms of policy, that this flies directly in the face of

5

what the Framers had in mind, absolutely.

6

violate the Constitution?
MR. LESSIG:

7

But does it

Well, if it flies in the face of

8

what the Framers had in mind, then the question is, is

9

there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect

10

to what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.
QUESTION:

11

Well, you know, certainly what is

12

happening in the country today in the way of

13

congressional -- under the Commerce Clause is totally

14

different than what the Framers had in mind, but we've

15

never felt that that was the criterion.

16

thought of, there weren't steamboats, there weren't

17

railroads.

18

MR. LESSIG:

19

QUESTION:

What the Framers

That's right.

We've said there was a general grant,

20

and that Congress was free to run with it in many

21

respects.

22

MR. LESSIG:

In many respects, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, but, as this Court has also said, there are

24

limits to what Congress can do under the Commerce Clause.

25

QUESTION:

But isn't --

1

QUESTION:

Can I ask you about one of the

2

limits, just focusing on the Copyright Clause and the

3

progress of science and useful arts?

4

that -- is that limited to encouraging creativity by

5

authors and inventors, or does it also include the

6

distribution of materials that might not otherwise be

7

distributed, like old films and so forth?
MR. LESSIG:

8
9

In your view, does

We're happy to adopt a broader

interpretation of what promote the progress is about,

10

within the general framework that the Framers established

11

in light of the English practice, which was a quid pro

12

quo.

The ability to facilitate distribution -QUESTION:

13

So that if the quid pro quo is that

14

we can facilitate distribution of some old film by an

15

additional monopoly grant, you'd think that's permissible?
MR. LESSIG:

16
17

upon the distribution.
QUESTION:

18

So long as the grant is conditioned
So long as the grant --

In other words you could have --

19

right now, if Congress decides to have a law, and this law

20

is going to give copyrights in 1) the Bible, 2)

21

Shakespeare, 3) Ben Jonson, and the reason they do it is

22

that they think that that would lead publishers to produce

23

those and distribute them, and they're right, they will,

24

okay?

25

In your view, that's perfectly constitutional?
MR. LESSIG:

No, that's the view of the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government's, Justice Breyer.

2

QUESTION:

My view is --

Well, I thought that was the question

3

you were getting, and I thought you were saying -- I must

4

have misunderstood.

5

constitutional.

I thought you were saying that was

MR. LESSIG:

6

No.

What we were saying is, if

7

Congress wants to permit restoration of films, for

8

example, an issue that's been well briefed here, Congress

9

can say, if you restore the film, then the restoration

10

gets a copyright so long as it satisfies originality as

11

outlined in Feist, and it gets a copyright for a period of

12

time.

13

made clear that it could not extend copyrights to works in

14

the public domain.

15

but we stand on that as a way of understanding why this

16

Court --

17

But this Court's opinion in Graham and in Feist

QUESTION:

The Government doesn't concede that,

So your answer to Justice Stevens is

18

no, they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of

19

dissemination to publishers, is that right?

20

MR. LESSIG:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LESSIG:

23

No.

Oh, all right.
They cannot give a copyright purely

for purposes of distribution to publishers.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. LESSIG:

They would need to satisfy all of

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the implied limitations that this Court has expressed in

2

the context of this, the most carefully limited clause in

3

Article I, section 8.
QUESTION:

4

It is one of the --

Mr. Lessig, the clause says, Congress

5

shall, and suppose Congress decides in this expanded world

6

of ours that it's going to make certain changes and demand

7

other changes from our treaty partners.

8

well, the Germans led the fight for 70 years in the

9

European Union, we'll go with that, but we're going to

Suppose it says,

10

insist that they have a more expansive notion of, say, a

11

fair use.

12

of knowledge?

13

Now, why couldn't that fit within the promotion

MR. LESSIG:

Justice Ginsburg, we have no

14

quarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within

15

the "promote the progress of science" understanding,

16

subject to constitutional limitations.

17

If France adopted a rule that said you couldn't

18

grant copyrights to hate speech, we could not harmonize

19

with that rule consistent with our First Amendment and

20

similarly, as Mary Beth Peters testified before Congress,

21

ours is the only Constitution that has an express

22

limitation on terms.

23

it means that we are limited in our ability to agree with

24

the Europeans as they continually expand the term in light

25

of their own vision of what copyright is about, then

That's got to mean something, and if

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's the meaning of a constitutional restriction.
This Court's interpretation of "limited times"

2
3

could, of course, eviscerate that term of any meaning, but

4

under the principle of enumeration as this Court has

5

articulated it, this Court should interpret that clause in

6

a way that gives its terms effect in a simple way.

7

as a limited addition print is not a limited -- is not

8

limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is

9

printed, so, too, a limited term is not limited if each

10

time copyright holders come to Congress they can extend

11

the term.

12

QUESTION:

Just

Well, but the difference -- the

13

reason that analogy doesn't cut it for me is that the

14

limited edition print depends basically on an implied

15

understanding between the person who makes the print and

16

the person who buys it, and the understanding is, you

17

won't go beyond 100, or whatever number you write.

18

We're not engaged in a contractual analysis

19

under the Copyright Clause between the writer and the --

20

and somebody representing the public domain.

21

MR. LESSIG:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LESSIG:

That's right.

The analogy doesn't seem to work.
That's right.

All that I'm

24

suggesting is, here is a plain meaning of the term that

25

gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

assures that, in fact, the limit is respected, contrary to

2

the Government's argument, which, in effect, permits

3

Congress the power perpetually to extend terms.

4

If I may reserve the remainder of my time.

QUESTION:

General Olson, we'll hear from you.

Very well, Mr. Lessig.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL OLSON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

obstacles to petitioners' petition in, position in this

14

case.

15

copyright protection to the authors of any books already

16

printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing

17

copyrights.

18

and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary

19

extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law

20

revisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal

21

copyright and patent protection of subsisting works.

22

That is that the first Congress explicitly gave

Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998,

As this Court explained 100 and some years ago

Clause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first

4

through the 105th Congress.

GENERAL OLSON:

GENERAL OLSON:

How can that be
Maybe

Well, the Congress --

And that's our question, really.
Well, that -- it seems to me

17

that there may be -- this is -- the clause itself is a

very, very broad grant.

21

QUESTION:

It says the --

Do you view it as entirely a grant,

or do you think it also contains limitations?
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think that to the extent

22

that there may be limitations, Justice Stevens, they

23

are -- require considerable deference by this Court to the

24

judgment of Congress --

25

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but do

Alderson Reporting Company

1

you -- I'd be interested in knowing, do you think it does

2

contain limitations?

3

GENERAL OLSON:

It contains -- the clause itself

4

contains limitations, limited times, authors, exclusive

5

rights and things of that nature.

6

the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that

7

there are any substantive limitations in the "Promote the-

8

Progress" Clause.

9

I don't think -- and

What the Framers were saying is, we want to give

10

Congress the authority to promote the progress of useful

11

arts and sciences, and --

12

QUESTION:

How did the example we just talked

13

about, a patentee giving an extra 10 years on his -- how

14

does that promote the progress of science?

15

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it may provide additional

16

incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and

17

disseminate that particular work.

18

creative works like works of art, books and that sort of

19

thing, it may provide many ways --

20

QUESTION:

With respect to

I'm just concentrating on our

21

patentee, and I'm wondering how that fits into the notion

22

that there was a bargain in effect between the inventor

23

and the Government that at a certain period of time it

24

would become part of the public domain.

25

it's inconsistent with that.

It seems to me

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

It isn't inconsistent, I submit,

2

Justice Stevens, for the Congress to exercise its juris --

3

its responsibility under this broad grant of power to

4

determine that there could be many ways in which the

5

holder of an existing right may benefit the public by

6

continuing to have that right for an additional period of

7

time, the same reason that Congress -- same reasons that

8

Congress had when it created the right in the first place.

9

It's not just the right --

10
11
12

QUESTION:

No, the reason for the right in the

first place was to encourage invention.
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, but I -- we submit that

13

specifically with respect to the Copyright Clause, but I

14

think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at

15

all, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the

16

writing of the work -- and this relates to the questions

17

that were asked of my colleague a moment ago.

18

the dissemination of the work, not necessarily --

19

QUESTION:

20

GENERAL OLSON:

21
22

It includes

Dissemination alone?
Not necessarily the

dissemination alone -QUESTION:

Well, no, not -- don't say not

23

necessarily.

24

I'd like to know, imagine we have just dissemination.

25

I'm -- for purposes of my thinking about it,

GENERAL OLSON:

That something is already in the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

public domain.
QUESTION:

2

That's correct.

The only

3

justification for the extension, there is no other, is

dissemination of a work that is already in existence.

8
9

I would not want to rule that

Well, I want to say, do you think yes

or no?
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think that it could very

10

well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the

11

Congress specifically was aware of -- that there were

12

State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the

enacting those copyright laws, and a couple of States

15

hadn't enacted them at all.

2

difference between this and a perpetual copyright.

3

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think that that's a very

4

good illustration of why the authority is granted to

5

Congress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that

6

may make a considerable difference in terms of what you

7

decide to do.

QUESTION:

How could it?

9

GENERAL OLSON:

It may -- because you may -- if

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think again that

24

illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to

25

make these judgments rather than in courts to make these

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

could possibly do that.

10

minds of the Congress, even if somehow they didn't violate

11

the clause.

12

principle out there that would ever kick in?

But if we affirm here, is there any limiting

GENERAL OLSON:

13

Well, that's a -- that is a

14

difficult question to say whether there is any limiting

principle when such a broad grant of power, authority is

GENERAL OLSON:

What I submit -- well, first of

all, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as

22

prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment

23

that this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the

QUESTION:

General Olson, you say that the

13

functional equivalent of an unlimited time would be a

14

violation, but that's precisely the argument that's being

15

made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is

16

extendable is the functionable, functional equivalent of

17

an unlimited time, a limited time that 10 years from now

18

can be extended, and then extended again, and extended

19

again.

20

time doesn't mean anything unless it means, once you have

21

established the limit for works that have been created

22

under that limit, that's the end.

23

Why -- their argument is precisely that, a limited

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, the Framers had an

24

opportunity to say immutable, unalterable, unamendable.

25

They didn't use that.

They used the phrase, limited term,

With the exception of a limitation

one hand and a definite number on the other, is there any

Does the promotion, does the

10

preambular recitation of promotion as such place a limit

11

on it?
GENERAL OLSON:

12

I submit, Justice Souter, that

13

there's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice

14

Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,

15

having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that

doesn't work very well because of the economies of other

countries, the parade of constraints on artists in other

because to go back for one second, in practical, economic

is probably something less than 1,000 -- on $1,000 a

not going to get protection.

GENERAL OLSON:

The -- as we described in our

brief, in pages 34 through 36, I believe it is in our

brief, that the concerns about the limitation on

15

exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in

convenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the

goals.

3

QUESTION:

Okay, and is your argument that we

4

should so find and hold against their retrospective

5

argument, because there is some, at least plausible basis

6

to say that there can be a causal connection between the

7

retrospective extension and some benefit that can be

8

traced to those particular works through the retrospective

9

extension, like dissemination?

10
11
12

GENERAL OLSON:

Is that your argument?

That is among our arguments,

Justice Souter.
QUESTION:

Is it also your argument that even if

13

you cannot trace that kind, or at least plausibly argue

14

that there could be that kind of a causal benefit, that it

15

would still be constitutional, because you should judge

16

the extension simply as contributing to a general system,

17

one feature of which is that from time to time there may

18

be retrospective extensions, and so long as that general

19

system induces the creation of works, or the dissemination

20

of works, or the preservation of works, so long as the

21

general system works, there is no review, no limitation on

22

the tinkering that can be done, even retrospectively?

23

that also your argument?

24

GENERAL OLSON:

25

Is

I think that's a fair statement

of an argument that we have made and articulated in the

3

GENERAL OLSON:

-- that unless there is a -- the

4

Court is -- because the circumstances change, that we are

living in an era now where piracy is a significant

6

problem, there's question of administrative ease, of

7

administering a system where copyrights may be different

8

for one set of authors, or different for another set of

9

authors, there's changes that are taking place

10

internationally, so that what we're saying is that not

12

thought it was accomplishing the objectives of this

13

clause, but that there are numerous objectives that are

14

entirely legitimate in --

15

QUESTION:

Do you also argue that the Necessary

16

and Proper Clause alone will justify the retroactive

17

extension simply as a matter of equity?

18

GENERAL OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

That is, that the Copyright Clause

20

justifies the extension for works not yet created, but it

21

would be enormously inequitable to have other authors who

22

put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so

23

the Necessary and Proper Clause now allows you to do the

24

retrospective?

25

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, Justice Scalia, and the

The implicit promise that --

I mean, they have some right to

10

unreasonable expectation at all, Justice Stevens, because

11

that was the premise of the --

12

QUESTION:

That is the way it's always been

13

done.

There hasn't been any copyright extension that

14

hasn't applied to subsisting work.

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

That's --

But there was one -- Justice Breyer

brought up Ben Jonson, so -- this case doesn't involve

extension of the copyright for those whose copyright will

expire tomorrow if it's not extended, in order to put them

on parity with those getting copyrights for new works, why

doesn't it apply to the copyright, the holder of the

GENERAL OLSON:

You could arguably -- you could

conceivably make that argument, Justice Souter, but there

Well, of course, the original statute

was replacing a bunch of State statutes or State rules,

14

partly common law, partly statutory, that -- they had kind

15

of a mixed up legal situation, and there was an interest

16

in having one uniform rule for the first time around.

17

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, there was an interest in

18

having a uniform rule, and that's precisely why the

19

Framers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution,

20

but there was copyright protection in some States, there

21

wasn't copyright protection in other States, and what we

22

know from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton

23

decision is that there was not a common law copyright in

existence.

This Court explicitly held that.

13

GENERAL OLSON:

No, no, you finish first.

Well, I was going to say there's

14

no language whatsoever of preemption, abandonment,

abrogation, or exchange in the 1790 copyright, but

16

compare -- Copyright Act.

exchange there.

19

But compare that to the 1793

The other thing, as this Court has said, there

is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would

be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the

the concept of the creator plus the creator's first

22

which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that

so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790

to gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially

copyright authority, that might be a plausible argument,

but the very first time this Court ever struck down a law

of Congress as exceeding Article I, section 8 power was in

5

the context of the Copyright Clause.

6

We have 125 years of history of this Court

7

making sure that the limits, both express and implied, in

8

the Copyright Clause, have some meaning.

limit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was

11

trying to get me to say.

12

out very clear limits on the context of the ability to

13

extend works in the public domain.

irrelevant and wrong.

Now, this delicate balance that the Government

2

invokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers.

3

delicate balance is that, under the most reasonable

4

assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our

5

interest rate of 7 percent, as the amicus economists note

6

at page 6, note 6 of their brief, the current term gives

7

authors 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term.

The

Now, that might be a delicate balance, that they
give the author 99.8 percent and the public .2 percent,

of that term.
