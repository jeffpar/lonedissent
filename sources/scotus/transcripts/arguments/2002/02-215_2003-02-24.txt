ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAUER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GRAUER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For three reasons, the important Federal policy

12

favoring arbitration would be seriously undermined if

13

courts become entangled in speculative litigation over

14

arbitration remedies.

15

limitation on remedies in arbitration ought to be decided

16

in the first instance by the arbitrator, since that's not

17

a gateway issue of arbitrability.

18

First, the enforceability of a

Second, it's unlikely in this case that the

19

arbitrator would have found that the limitations on

20

remedies agreed by the parties would have precluded the

21

award of RICO treble damages, and third, there is simply

22

no reason why parties found by the district court to be

23

sophisticated cannot mutually agree to limit remedies.

24

Turning, then, to --

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Grauer, on the second point that

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

you made, you said it's unlikely that the arbitrators

2

would find that treble damages are inconsistent with

3

the -- with the contracts.

4

were to be before the arbitrator, would you concede that

5

the contracts in question permit treble damages awards on

6

a RICO claim?

Would you make that contention?

7

MR. GRAUER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GRAUER:

10

Would you, supposing this case

QUESTION:

Yes.

Thank you.
Yes.

On your first point, suppose you have

11

a contract that is very clear that there can be no triple

12

damages under RICO, that's right in the contract, is it

13

your position that that goes to the arbitrator and it's

14

for the arbitrator to say that this violates public policy

15

and I'm going to -- well, I mean, what would happen in

16

that case?

17

MR. GRAUER:

18

arbitrator to decide.

19

a 40-year tradition of allowing arbitrators to make

20

decisions of that nature and of allowing issues of the

21

remedies that can arise in arbitration to be decided by

22

the arbitrator.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, we believe that it's for the
We believe that there's essentially

The arbitrator, I take it, on the

24

face of the contract simply could not award the damages,

25

or are you saying that he might?

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GRAUER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

The arbitrator --

He'd say, this is against public

3

policy and I'm giving you triple damages?

I don't care

4

what the contract says, I go beyond the scope of the

5

arbitration contract?

6

MR. GRAUER:

Well, the arbitrator is bound first

7

and foremost, under both the law and under the arbitration

8

clauses in this case, to comply with the controlling law.

9

This Court has held several times, in Mitsubishi, in

10

Vimar, in Gilmer, and in other cases that we should not

11

suppose that the arbitrator will not follow the law.

12

should assume that the arbitrator will follow the law and,

13

therefore, if the law requires the award of treble

14

damages, even if the parties have agreed otherwise, the

15

arbitrator is bound to follow that law.

16

QUESTION:

We

What's our best case, or is there

17

one, for the proposition that if the contract says the

18

arbitrator may not do X, and X violates public policy,

19

that the arbitrator goes ahead and does it anyway?

20

our case that says that?

21

MR. GRAUER:

What's

I believe that that would be found

22

in Mitsubishi, in the Vimar y Seguros case at page 541, in

23

the McMahon case at page --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but I'm not sure in any of

those cases it was clear that the contract in very

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

explicit terms said, you cannot do this.

2

recognize that in those cases it does say if there's

3

important public policy it can't be overturned by the

4

arbitration.

5

MR. GRAUER:

I -- I -- I

I think the -- one example -- there

6

are several examples, but one that comes to mind is that

7

in the Vimar case the COGSA prevented the arbitrator

8

from -- the COGSA prevented any reduction in liability in

9

a bill of lading, and -- and there was a concern that the

10

law in Japan which had been selected to conduct the

11

arbitration had a different set of rules that could have

12

allowed the stevedores to be -- to have liability laid off

13

on the stevedores, and yet the Court said, we will not

14

indulge in the presumption that the arbitrator will not

15

follow the appropriate law and, therefore, even though

16

Japanese law was different, the arbitrator, we assumed,

17

would follow the controlling law.

18

Now, in this particular case, it's -- it's not

19

only true that the -- that the Court has held several

20

times that we should not assume that an arbitrator will

21

fail to follow the controlling law, but all of the

22

arbitration agreements, and I would cite the Court to the

23

joint appendix, pages 84, 147, 168, and 212, in each of

24

the arbitration agreements in this case, the arbitrator is

25

admonished to follow the controlling law.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, but in one of the arbitration

2

clauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or

3

ignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no

4

authority to award extracontractual damages at any time,

5

including punitive or exemplary damages.

6

Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a

7

provision like that?

Is that not the kind of thing that

8

courts have looked at and determined whether that's a

9

valid public policy or not?

10

MR. GRAUER:

I wouldn't agree with the Court

11

looking at that, and here's why.

12

read, Justice O'Connor, is, in fact, what's in that

13

agreement, but if you read on in that sentence it says,

14

and the arbitrator shall follow the controlling law.

15

best, there is a conflict or a tension between those

16

terms, and this is what arbitrators do all the time.

I agree that what you

At

17

There are all these agreements that are -- that

18

every day are presented to arbitrators that have a number

19

of provisions that could step on each other, and -- and

20

the arbitrator has to interpret the contract.

21

we bargained for in entering an arbitration agreement,

22

that if there was some tension, or some confusion or

23

dispute, that the arbitr --

24

QUESTION:

25

waiver of a statutory right --

That's what

Have we ever allowed a prospective

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GRAUER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GRAUER:

Prospective --

-- in these arbitration contexts?
The prospective waivers -- yes, I

4

believe that that, for example, in our brief we cited a

5

number of cases such as Mezzanatto that create a

6

presumption that a statutory right is waivable unless

7

Congress has said otherwise.

8

Now, in the arbitration context, again, to get

9

back to the Vimar y Seguros case, the party was agreeing

10

to arbitration even though there was a concern before the

11

arbitration that the arbitrator might not follow the

12

correct law.
The guiding principle of -- that -- that has

13
14

guided this Court's jurisprudence for -- for years, and

15

it's been reiterated in Mitsubishi, and McMahon, and --

16

and Vimar, and Gilmer, is that we should assume that the

17

arbitrator will apply -- will apply the correct law, but

18

if --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Grauer, on the question of

20

waiver, you have represented, and I want to make this

21

clear, that waiver would be academic in this situation,

22

since you say you will concede that all of these contracts

23

allow the arbitrator to award treble damages.

24

correct in understanding that waiver would be academic

25

because you're not going to make the argument of waiver,

Is -- am I

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

you're going to make -- you're going to concede that

2

treble damages are available if a RICO violation is found?
MR. GRAUER:

3

Absolutely.

I agree with that,

4

Justice Ginsburg, and as a matter of fact for two reasons,

5

not only because we've made that concession, but also

6

because we agreed to arbitrate.

7

submit any issues to the arbitrator and therefore, even if

8

we had not made that concession, we would believe that the

9

arbitrator ought to be asked in the first instance to

10

That means we agreed to

decide the validity of a waiver.
QUESTION:

11

But suppose the arbitrator gets it

12

wrong.

13

no punitive damages, excludes treble damages, and that

14

that prevails.

15

review?

16

Suppose the arbitrator thinks that the provision,

Could that be corrected by post award

MR. GRAUER:

To the extent -- yes, I think it

17

could, and here's why.

The one thing that this Court has

18

said, no fewer than four times, and -- and has emphasized

19

I think those four times, is that when a statutory claim

20

is arbitrated, there -- the -- we assume that post

21

arbitration review is sufficient to ensure the vindication

22

of statutory interests, and the Court mentioned that not

23

only in McMahon at page 232, in Gilmer at footnote 4, and

24

also in Vimar and in Mitsubishi.

25

cases, this Court has specific -- excuse me -- this Court

In all four of those

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

has specifically said that -- that, while limited, post

2

arbitration review is sufficient to ensure that statutory

3

interests are vindicated.

4

QUESTION:

In other words, it's quite simple.

I

5

don't see what's so complicated about this.

I thought

6

what you were saying, and I thought that's what the law

7

was, but tell me if I'm not right, please, is,

8

interpreting the contract is a matter for the arbitrator,

9

but once we know what the contract means, then whether

10

that contract, as interpreted, provides sufficient remedy

11

to be valid as an arbitration contract is for the judge.

12
13
14

MR. GRAUER:

I would -- I would agree with the

first part of that, Justice Breyer, and that is -QUESTION:

Well, why not the second?

I mean,

15

after all, if I have a contract which says, Jones and

16

Smith agree to arbitrate all damage claims, but no damages

17

shall ever be awarded, no matter what, okay, that's pretty

18

clear that the enforcement of that would invalidate that

19

arbitration agreement because it can't be enforced.

20

person who should say that is the judge, because the judge

21

says, look, you people don't have an arbitration contract.

22

Now, why you'd leave that to the arbitrator -- I

23

guess you could, but I think that is a gateway matter that

24

I think you'd have to be quadruple clear about that

25

somebody wanted that point decided by an arbitrator.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

The

1

3
4
5

Now, that's how I'm understanding it, so I'd
like you to correct me if I'm wrong.
MR. GRAUER:

I'm not sure I followed the first

part of the hypothetical.
QUESTION:

The first part's very simple.

What

6

the contract means is for the arbitrator.

The parties

7

have agreed to that.

8

whether it is an enforceable arbitration contract or

9

violates some anti -- some statute that says -- or some

But once we know what it means,

10

public policy and the -- which means, you two cannot

11

arbitrate this kind of thing with this kind of agreement,

12

that question of arbitrability is for the judge, because

13

it is a gateway matter.

14

If, in fact, this contract for arbitration is

15

unlawful, as against pubic policy or whatever, then there

16

is no arbitration contract, and that matter is a matter

17

for the judge, unless the parties clearly indicate that

18

they want it to be decided by an arbitrator.

19

through those cases a little while ago, and that seemed to

20

me what they said, and so I wrote it into an opinion which

21

I think every member of this Court but one agreed to.

22

MR. GRAUER:

And I read

Justice Breyer, I agree with the

23

first part, and that is this, that the gateway issue of

24

arbitrability involves the determination of, did the

25

parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if they

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

did, is the dispute within the scope of that agreement,

2

but that should end, in our view, the inquiry, because if

3

you don't end the inquiry at that point, you're -- you're

4

opening the door to questions about remedies and legal

5

issues and what are the elements of the cause of action

6

and what have the parties agreed to, and let me give you

7

an example.
The parties -- I sell you 10,000 widgets for a

8
9

dollar each, as is, and no -- and liquidated damages of $1

10

and no other liability, and we agree to that, okay.

Now,

11

the person then sues for RICO because they want to get

12

around that.

13

parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if so, is

14

the dispute in the scope of that agreement, and the fact

15

that there may be a downstream dispute about the validity

16

of the remedies and the validity of the waiver of the

17

remedies should not, under any circumstances, spill over

18

into the gateway --

19

QUESTION:

Well, the only issue ought to be, did the

I didn't say when you would decide

20

it.

21

don't know what the contract means, then I guess we have

22

to go to the arbitrator to find out before we know, before

23

we can present the judge.

24

it?

25

I said, the matter is a matter for the judge.

MR. GRAUER:

If we

That's Vimar, or Vimar, isn't

Vimar y Seguros, and I agree,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Breyer, that post arbitration -QUESTION:

2
3

I thought you probably would end up

agreeing.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. GRAUER:

Well, post, as long as the

6

agreement is that it's post arbitration.

7

arbitration review has been held four times by the Court

8

to be sufficient to clean up matters at the margin that

9

could come up.

10
11

QUESTION:

But if the contract is completely

cleared at the outset, why not pre-arbitration review?

12

MR. GRAUER:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

The post

If the con --

Why march up the hill and then march

down again?
MR. GRAUER:

Well, the courts -- I would

16

disagree with approaching it that way, because

17

unfortunately what's clear to a plaintiff's lawyer is

18

often not clear to a defense lawyer, and there are many

19

elements of a cause of action, there are many remedial

20

limitations --

21
22

QUESTION:

So you're saying that nothing is ever

clear to the bar?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. GRAUER:

25

My good friend, Mr. Whatley and I

agree on very little in the case, and that's the problem.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, do you say that this provision

2

in one of the arbitration clauses that the arbitrator

3

shall have no authority to award extracontractual damages

4

of any kind is not clear enough for a judge to determine

5

whether that's --

6

MR. GRAUER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GRAUER:

9

QUESTION:

-- against public policy?
Yes, I do, and here's why.

Why?

MR. GRAUER:

10

We feel that -- we --

Because we believe that we

11

bargained to have an arbitrator make that decision, and

12

there are many words in this case that may seem like it's

13

clear what they mean, but may in some contexts not be so

14

clear.
The word racketeering is used to describe a case

15
16

where a doctor is seeking to be paid more for treating a

17

patient.

18

feel that we bargained to have an arbitrator interpret

19

them, and as I indicated to Justice Ginsburg, it was

20

conceded some time ago that the term, extracontractual was

21

not in -- was intended to be noneconomic damages and was

22

not intended to be primarily remedial RICO treble damages,

23

but --

24
25

There are a lot of words in this case, and we

QUESTION:

Well, what you're arguing for

basically is that it should go to the arbitrator for a

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

decision of almost everything except what we have held to

2

be gateway issues, and that if it doesn't, it's just going

3

to kind of get bounced back and forth like a ping pong

4

ball.

5

MR. GRAUER:

I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.

I -- I

6

believe that the importance of the Court's recent

7

pronouncement in Howsam about gateway arbitrability as we

8

read that case is that you determine, did the parties

9

intend to subject themselves to the power of an

10

arbitrator?

Did they make an arbitration agreement, and

11

is the dispute within the scope of that agreement, and if

12

the answers to those questions are yes, the only

13

additional issue that comes up, and the one that

14

unfortunately became conflated in the Eleventh Circuit

15

below, is where there is a statutory claim, there is an

16

additional analysis that this Court has traditionally

17

done, and that is, did Congress, by enacting that statute,

18

intend to override or preempt the Federal Arbitration Act,

19

and that's the issue that has come up, and unfortunately

20

what's happened in the Eleventh and the Ninth Circuits is

21

that they have taken that concept of simply making a

22

determination of whether another statute is -- preempts

23

the Federal Arbitration Act, and they've used it to create

24

essentially a floating analysis of effective vindication

25

that's untethered to the statutory conflict analysis.

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Okay, how -- how clear has it got to

2

be before there is some kind of a tether?

Let's assume

3

you had a simpler case than this one in which the

4

arbitration agreement provided -- this is silly, but for

5

the sake of a point, that no damages will be awarded by

6

the arbitrator for the violation of any statutory claim,

7

as distinct from a tort claim, common law tort claim, or a

8

contract claim.

9

was, in fact, a threshold question of arbitrability

Would you say that in that case there

10

because that provision went so clearly to the validity of

11

the agreement that it should be treated as a, could be

12

properly treated as a threshold matter for a court?
MR. GRAUER:

13

It would depend, Justice Souter.

14

believe that there could be a situation where an

15

agreement --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GRAUER:

I

Well, how about my situation?
In -- in -- in your situation, the

18

reason I say your situation would depend is that there are

19

many contracts where that would be a perfectly legitimate

20

understanding.

21

widgets, $1 each, I haven't checked them over, they may be

22

no darned good, but you want them for $1 each, and I don't

23

want to be sued for this, so I want liquidated damages of

24

$1.

25

For example, I -- I'll sell you 10,000

That type of commercial arrangement -QUESTION:

Yeah, but in that case you're --

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

well, and again, maybe -- maybe this is where it gets

2

theoretical.

3

you're

4

-- in the case I gave, maybe it's the same point, I just

5

said you waive damages.

6

waive -- on that theory you wouldn't be waiving equitable

7

remedies if there were any, so -- so let's just take my

8

case.

9

You waive the damages.

10

In -- in that case, in effect, you're --

waiving any statutory claim at the beginning.

In

I -- I suppose you wouldn't

You waive the damages -- you don't waive the claim.
You don't waive the right to

equitable remedy.
Is -- is that -- is the -- is the -- in effect

11
12

the -- the waiver of the right to damages in the

13

arbitration agreement sufficient to raise a serious enough

14

question about the enforceability of the arbitration

15

agreement to qualify that question as a gateway question?
MR. GRAUER:

16

I believe the answer is no, with

17

one exception.

18

should be dealt with by the arbitrator, and we should

19

assume that -- that if there is something improper about

20

that remedial limitation, that the arbitrator will -- will

21

do what he or she is supposed to do, follow the law, get

22

it right.

23

In general, anything relating to remedies

QUESTION:

Okay, but you're saying, I think

24

you're saying, and -- and correct me if I 'm wrong,

25

that -- that no remedial question can ever rise to the

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

level of a -- a potential threat to the potential -- to --

2

to vindication of statutory rights.

3

may mean, as we have employed it, a mere question of -- of

4

waiver of remedies will never rise to that level and,

5

hence, will never get to the threshold question status, is

6

that correct?

7

MR. GRAUER:

Whatever that phrase

As a general premise, I believe

8

that's correct.

9

where a variety of factors, including that, are linked

10

together such that the plaintiff might make a motion to

11

revoke the arbitration agreement itself on the, on

12

traditional contract grounds should there be a whole

13

series of things that make a contract unconscionable or

14

onerous, but that did not occur in this case.

15

I think we could envision situations

In fact, the court found that it was not

16

unconscionable or onerous.

17

sophisticated parties, and so the court declined to do

18

section 2 revocation of the contract for generally

19

applicable contract grounds, but there could be a case

20

where a remedial limitation, combined with other factors,

21

could rise to that level, not -- certainly not this case.

22

The problem --

23

QUESTION:

It was negotiated between

And I take it you would say that if

24

at least the -- the details of the agreement that would

25

raise the issue to that level are specifically pleaded in

1

-- in -- in -- in the request, in -- in -- in the action

2

that takes it into court, that at least the -- the -- the

3

breadth of the frustration doctrine would not stand in the

4

way of -- of a court's adjudicating it?

5

MR. GRAUER:

Well, that's correct.

If I

6

understood you correctly, I -- I -- I believe in

7

arbitration cases there's frequently a motion by a

8

plaintiff to revoke the arbitration agreement on grounds

9

of unconscionability --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GRAUER:

12
13

time to time.

Yes.
-- and judges deal with those from

This is certainly not such a case.

QUESTION:

But I think you're simply saying

14

they've got to be specific in telling us right at the

15

outset what it is that makes it unconscionable.

16

can't just come up and say, oh well, there's a potential

17

for frustration here.

18

MR. GRAUER:

They

Right, and -- and it's very

19

important to note an additional distinction, and that is,

20

the -- the attack on unconscionability cannot be on the

21

contract as a whole, because if it is, under Prima Paint

22

that, too, should be decided by the arbitrator.

23

unconscionability, the only type of attack that could be

24

made would be on the arbitration clause itself.

25

QUESTION:

The only

Uh-huh.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

May I ask --

2

QUESTION:

Under what law is unconscionability

3

decided?

Is -- is it State law?
MR. GRAUER:

4

In this case, because there's a

5

Federal claim, and the case is in Federal court, the Court

6

has said a number of times that there is a Federal

7

substantive law of arbitrability, but the contract itself

8

was entered between people governed by State law, and so

9

the revocability question would be a decision about

10

whether that contract either as a whole, or the

11

arbitration clause itself, are revocable under the

12

applicable State law subject to the overlay, so to speak,

13

that's created by the Federal Arbitration Act in not

14

allowing States to have unconscionability laws that

15

would --

16

QUESTION:

Vitiate --

17

MR. GRAUER:

18

QUESTION:

-- vitiate an arbitration clause.

May I ask, I just want to -- I may be

19

missing what's perfectly obvious, but if you have a

20

contract in which the only remedy authorized to be

21

provided is an illegal remedy for some reason that could

22

not be taken away from the plaintiff, does the

23

arbitrator -- is that agreement immediately nonarbitrable,

24

or do you arbitrate the issues and then saying that

25

there's no remedy?

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GRAUER:

I don't believe either of those

2

would be the case.

I believe that if -- if the -- you

3

would arbitrate the issue, and you would expect the

4

arbitrator to follow the law.

5

QUESTION:

Even if, on the face of the contract,

6

a judge could say, the only remedy offered to a successful

7

complainant is one that may not be submitted to

8

arbitration?
MR. GRAUER:

9
10

with that.
QUESTION:

11
12

There's only -- I -- I don't agree

The waiver of a statutory right of

some kind.
MR. GRAUER:

13

There would be one way that the

14

plaintiff's lawyer could raise that issue, which is not

15

one of the -- what occurred in this case, but I suppose

16

you could argue that the entire arbitration agreement is

17

illusory and unconscionable, but -QUESTION:

18

Then if that's true, what if you have

19

a case in which there are two remedies available, one of

20

which is clearly impermissible as a matter of Federal law,

21

the other of which is permissible, but there's no

22

severability clause in the contract?

23

there?

24
25

MR. GRAUER:

What do you do

I believe in that case, as in the

prior one, you should send the matter to arbitration, you

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

should assume that the arbitrator will correctly apply the

2

law, that if there is a provision in the contract that's

3

unlawful, that the arbitrator will disregard it.

4

QUESTION:

I guess you'd have to -- the

5

arbitrator would have to decide whether implicit in the

6

terms of the contract is a decision by the parties that

7

would permit him to waive the thing.

8

Stevens' hypothetical will, I think -- I'd like the

9

answer, anyway.

I mean, Justice

If we assume in the contract it says, and

10

the parties agree that this contract is exclusive in

11

respect to remedy, and the arbitrator does not have the

12

power to strike out some remedies and put in others, okay,

13

so now they've done that, now I take it the answer to his

14

first hypothetical is, you go to the judge, and the

15

agreement's no good.

Isn't that right?

16

MR. GRAUER:

17

you correctly, and the reason -QUESTION:

18

No.

I don't agree, if I understood

The -- the contract has only one

19

remedy.

The remedy is clearly illegal.

There is a

20

sentence in the contract saying the arbitrator has no

21

power to add a new remedy or to strike the old one.

22

we have it absolutely clear that this is an unlawful

23

arbitration agreement, and the judge would say that

24

without sending it to arbitration, wouldn't he?

25

the same question I asked before --

Now

That's

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GRAUER:

2

QUESTION:

3

-- and I thought your answer was, of

course.

4

MR. GRAUER:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Right.

Well --

Maybe I'm wrong.

That's why I'm

asking.
MR. GRAUER:

If -- if there is a ground under

8

section 2 to revoke the arbitration clause for generally

9

applicable grounds, not because it's an arbitration

10

clause, then a party could make a motion of that nature

11

and the court, of course, would have to address that

12

motion, and -- but -- but I didn't want to get away from

13

the fact that I think is important, is that when you're

14

dealing with remedies, and when you're dealing with

15

arbitrators, we really need to assume that the arbitrator

16

will follow the law.

17

And -- and in this particular case, for example,

18

the arbitration clause does contain a limitation on

19

remedies, but that limitation on remedies could have been

20

put elsewhere in the contract, and if it were somewhere

21

else in the contract, or it might have been -- the parties

22

might not have agreed to arbitrate.

23

agreed that we'll litigate in Florida, but the Court will

24

not have the power to award punitive damages.

25

would not say that the limitation on punitive damages

They might have

Now, you

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

prevents the parties from having to go to Florida, and you

2

need to treat an arbitration clause, we think, the same,

3

or the parties might have had the remedial limitation in

4

this case, and no arbitration clause.

5

Now, what would a court do?

It would -- the

6

court would evaluate the validity of the remedial

7

limitation and make a decision.

exactly the same.

Unless there's an

additional question, I would reserve my time for rebuttal.

Mr. Whatley, we'll hear from you.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE R. WHATLEY, JR.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17

MR. WHATLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

We start with the principle that arbitrability

19

is to be determined by the court, as this Court has said

20

many times, including in AT&T and First Option, and that

21

there is no -- no presumption, or no liberal policy in

22

favor of giving that issue of arbitrability to the

23

arbitrator.

24
25

It's exactly the opposite.

You go one step further, since this case
involves an issue of public policy, and in both W. R.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Grace, and later in Misco and in Eastern Associated Coal

2

Corporation, this Court said that questions of public

3

policy are for the court, not for the arbitrator.

4

QUESTION:

We also said that that kind of

5

question that would affect an arbitration is fairly rare,

6

didn't we?

7

MR. WHATLEY:

You did, Your Honor, and in fact I

8

think this case shows that it -- that it's rare, and I

9

think the various amicus briefs that have been submitted

10

shows that an effort to put limits on remedies, which this

11

Court has attacked many times, is rare.

12

defendants didn't do that here.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

I mean, other

The Well Point didn't --

You say -- you say this Court has

attacked what many times?
MR. WHATLEY:

This Court -- within the context

16

of arbitration, Justice O'Connor's question, this Court

17

has never allowed the waiver of statutory remedies in the

18

context of an arbitration, enforcing an arbitration

19

provision.

20

case right through Waffle House, this Court over and over

21

and over again has quoted the portions of Mitsubishi, and

22

footnote 19 from Mitsubishi, saying that you're only

23

changing the forum when you're arbitrating.

24
25

If you go back to Mitsubishi and follow every

QUESTION:

Mr. Whatley, Mr. Grauer has conceded

that there is no waiver here, that treble damages are

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

available, so why are we engaging in this academic

2

exercise?
MR. WHATLEY:

3

Well, the concern I have with

4

that, Your Honor, is if -- if you read the question

5

presented in his brief, that's not what it says.
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, he's made the concession right

now --

8

MR. WHATLEY:

9

QUESTION:

He has made the --

-- and he has five arguments for

10

saying, any good lawyer would, that these words that you

11

read punitive damages, extracontractual damages, do not

12

prevent the arbitrator from awarding treble damages, so he

13

has one interpreting the thing, two, if the interpretation

14

fails he concedes it, three, there's nothing in the

15

contract says he can't concede it, and so why don't we

16

send this to the arbitrator to find out what the contract

17

means before we decide that it must mean something that

18

would bar its enforcement?

19

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, the problem with that -- the

20

problem with that is, doing it after the fact has some

21

pretty severe policy implications.

22
23

QUESTION:

But didn't we, the Court hold

precisely, do it after the fact, in Vimar?

24

MR. WHATLEY:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

It's precisely the same circumstance.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WHATLEY:

In that case, Your Honor, you were

2

dealing with the international context, where you said,

3

starting in Mitsubishi is a -- is a special situation

4

concerning, where you've got to be concerned with

5

international law.

That's number one.

Number two, especially when you use the United

6
7

language that Justice O'Connor quoted, you couldn't get

8

much more clear than United was in its provision, no

9

extracontractual damages, including -QUESTION:

10
11

This contract doesn't cover a tort

action.

12

MR. WHATLEY:

13

QUESTION:

It doesn't cover a tort action.

In other words, what they wanted to

14

have is an arbitration between doctors and hospitals, and

15

the single most likely, or a very, very likely kind of

16

dispute they call tort disputes, aren't even covered by

17

the arbitration agreement, and it's impossible for an

18

arbitrator to come to a different conclusion.

19
20
21

MR. WHATLEY:

That is -- that is -- that is our

position, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know that's your position.

It's

22

just, as I said it with my tone of voice, I'm suggesting

23

it sounds implausible.

24

MR. WHATLEY:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

So what I'd like is an argument for

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that position.
MR. WHATLEY:

Well, the argument for that

3

position is, you start with the language, and you don't

4

only start with the language that says, no

5

extracontractual damages and, in fact, the issue you get

6

in arbitration, and -- and -- and you go to arbitration,

7

and I know we assume arbitrators are going to follow the

8

law, absolutely, the Court has said that many times,

9

although many arbitrators are not lawyers, but I've

10
11
12

handled many arbitrations, and -QUESTION:

Well, many judges who are lawyers end

up not following the law.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. WHATLEY:

15

Your Honor, you can say that, but

I don't think I can.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. WHATLEY:

And -- and the arbitrators almost

18

invariably say, you know, this is -- this is what created

19

me, the contract is my Bible, where I get my directions,

20

and if the contract says very plainly, no extracontractual

21

damages, even if later on it says, and follow the law, and

22

if it says -- says that you can't vary or ignore the terms

23

of this agreement, which this agreement says, that is a

24

strong impediment against an arbitrator awarding

25

appropriate relief where you've got a Federal statute that

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

creates tort-like damages.
QUESTION:

Every one of these contracts says the

3

arbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no

4

power to commit errors of law.

5

that those provisions may be intention, but when they are,

6

the one that controls is the one that says the arbitrator

7

must follow the law.

8
9

MR. WHATLEY:

Mr. Grauer, I think, said

Well, that's good, and now that

the issue has been specifically raised, and after the

10

fact, after it's raised they come in and waive it.

11

concern we have is, what about the times when it's not

12

specifically raised?

13

forward through arbitration and perhaps --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

What about the times when you go

That's another case.

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, it's not -- it's this

language, though, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

20

We're deciding

this case.

17

19

The

It's this language.

But you don't litigate this language.

You're litigating a particular case before us.
MR. WHATLEY:

But -- but Your Honor, they didn't

21

come in and waive that position until it got before Judge

22

Moreno, and Judge Moreno was going to hold it illegal,

23

going to hold this arbitration agreement unenforceable

24

because of the overreaching they engaged in by limiting

25

the remedies that could be awarded.

It was only then, having been caught, that they
say, okay -QUESTION:

Mr. Whatley, they were never before

an arbitrator, were they?
MR. WHATLEY:

Well, they were never before an

6

arbitrator, that's true, Your Honor.

They were never

7

before an arbitrator, but that's when it was finally

8

waived, after the issue was specifically presented, and

9

the judge was not going to enforce it, and that's when

10

Judge Moreno said no, we're not going to allow this after

11

the fact waiver.

12

QUESTION:

After the fact -- when did he think

13

it should have been waived in order to -- to assist the

14

petitioner here?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, in truth, I think he thought

it should never -- if they're going to take -QUESTION:

Well then, if he thought it should

never be, then what does after the fact mean?
MR. WHATLEY:

It means, after the issue was

20

presented to the trial court.

21

QUESTION:

Well, but that happens all the time.

22

An issue is presented to the trial court, and you say,

23

well, on second thought I'm not going to do that.

24
25

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, but the problem with that

is, Your Honor, it means that that provision is still

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there.

It's still addressed.
QUESTION:

Well, that's true if parties settle a

4

QUESTION:

Yes, absolutely.

5

MR. WHATLEY:

2
3

case.

Well, if parties settle a case,

6

that's a very different question, because this is a

7

prospective provision that applies out into the future,

8

and that's the difference.

9

difference about our argument about waiver that's

10
11

The way -- that's the whole

presented to you.
Of course people waive things in settlements all

12

the time, but they don't waive things prospectively, and

13

this Court hasn't allowed the waiver of statutory rights

14

prospectively.

15

That's the big difference.

QUESTION:

The big question for arbitration is,

16

was there a violation of RICO, and I think one of the

17

questions from the bench suggested that the scope of

18

remedy doesn't rise to the same level as, is there a

19

violation of the act, and if in this case the arbitrator

20

should find that if there is no violation of RICO on the

21

part of care organizations, then there would never be any

22

issue of remedy.

23

MR. WHATLEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, that --

And, but you want to take that issue,

which the parties did agree to arbitrate, and put that in

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the courts, because you say there's something defective in

2

the remedy provision of the arbitration.
MR. WHATLEY:

3

That's true, but if -- if -- if a

4

court or an arbitrator can't grant the remedies that

5

Congress has authorized for a violation, including for a

6

criminal violation, if the court can't grant that relief,

7

then there is a serious public policy problem with putting

8

the parties into that forum to make that decision.
QUESTION:

9
10
11
12

And just what is that public policy

problem?
MR. WHATLEY:

The public policy problem is

that -- is that the arbitrator then cannot remedy it.

13

QUESTION:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

Well, do you take the position that

15

the arbitrator in a case like this could not even --

16

could -- let's assume -- let's assume the arbitrator took

17

the position that he couldn't award treble damages.

18

you take the position that under this contract the

19

arbitrator could not award simple compensatory damages?

20

MR. WHATLEY:

Under the plain language of the

21

United contract, yes, Your Honor, because it says no

22

extracontractual damages.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Do

And do you take the position that he

couldn't even determine liability?
MR. WHATLEY:

No, Your Honor, I don't take

1

that --

2

QUESTION:

Well, who --

3

QUESTION:

Then why isn't this premature?

4

mean, as Justice Ginsburg says, suppose he finds no

5

violation?

That's the end of it.

MR. WHATLEY:

6

I

It -- it -- it's premature because

7

it -- it is a -- it is -- it is a wasted process if you

8

can go through a proceeding --

9

QUESTION:

You mean it's not premature.

MR. WHATLEY:

10

To go through the arbitration

11

process, when you know in advance that -- that the

12

arbitrator can't fully remedy the violation -QUESTION:

13

But maybe the arbitrator will run --

14

reach a conclusion that is consistent with the contract,

15

say simple contract damages, and then it is not a waste of

16

time.

17

MR. WHATLEY:

18

what Judge Moreno did.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WHATLEY:

21

24
25

Why doesn't -Judge Moreno said that the

contract claim goes to the arbitrator.
QUESTION:

22
23

But Your Honor, that's exactly

Well, so then you're splitting the

thing up.
MR. WHATLEY:

things up in Byrd.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. WHATLEY:

You split things up in Volt.

And

3

-- and I mean, that is not -- there are many cases where

MR. WHATLEY:

7

QUESTION:

8
9
10
11
12
13

Well -And some claims stay in court.

But what you're saying is, one issue

goes to arbitration, the other one doesn't.
MR. WHATLEY:

And then the parties decide, do

they want to pursue that issue in arbitration.
QUESTION:

That just really complicates the

procedure.
MR. WHATLEY:

Actually, it did not.

In this

14

instance, it really simplified the situation, because here

15

what you're dealing with, and what the focus of the claims

16

are on, is -- is the automatic adjudication of claims the

17

way they -- the way they adjudicate claims of doctors

18

through computerized processes that by computerization

19

automatically down-code a bundle.

20

You're dealing with claims that are $5, $10,

21

$15, that frankly can't be resolved through an arbitration

22

process or any process on a claim by claim basis, but the

23

judge said, you've got to go forward in arbitration on the

24

breach of contract claims and, since those weren't

25

practical to pursue in any forum, we made the decision,

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and the -- and the doctors, the individual doctors made

2

the decision not to pursue them.

3

resolved very efficiently in the district court on whether

4

the claims should be arbitrated or not arbitrated, and

5

that dispute ended, and -- and so it was done very, very

6

efficiently in this instance.

7

QUESTION:

Those are over.

It was

When you wrote that word, or whoever

8

wrote it, the word extracontractual, no extracontractual

9

damages, now, I guess it could mean one of two things.

10

could mean what you think it means, which is, you can't

11

bring any tort cases, all you can bring are contract

12

cases, you can't bring any statutory cases in arbitration,

13

or it might mean, if you happen to have a contract case,

14

if that's the nature of the case, you cannot give damages

15

for mental suffering or other kinds of punitive damages in

16

a contract case.

It

Now, if you were drafting this, and you wanted

17
18

it to mean the first, rather than meaning the second, why

19

didn't you just write the words, there won't be a tort

20

case?

21

MR. WHATLEY:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

Why didn't you just write the words,

23

there won't be a statutory case?

24

MR. WHATLEY:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

Why did you run all around Robin

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Hood's barn in order to -- whatever they -- my -- Rob --

2

whatever you say.

3

complicated way just to tell people, we don't want tort

4

cases in -- or this arbitration?

5

MR. WHATLEY:

6

I mean, why did you get such a

write this.

7

QUESTION:

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Your Honor, first of all, I didn't

Of course you didn't.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest

it's your fault.
MR. WHATLEY:

This is -- this is -- this is in

12

the form contract that United presented to -- to doctors

13

and medical groups and had them sign under a section that

14

says, resolution of disputes, that only refers to

15

arbitration when you get down into the print.

16

even -- it's not even entitled arbitration, but -- but --

17

but I mean, could I have written it differently to say --

18

of course I could.

19

It's not

But I mean -- I mean, they wrote it, and -- and

20

-- and it's really our position that they wrote it to

21

discourage doctors from being able to -- to -- to recover

22

claims in arbitration, and to limit what doctors could

23

recover, not only to send them to arbitration, but then

24

also to place limits on what they could get once they got

25

there, because they didn't limit, they didn't have a

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

provision, like they seem to say in their briefs, we

2

waive, each party waives punitive damages against the

3

other, and then you would have to consider under State

4

law, can you do that, depending on where you are.

5

Instead, they say --

6

QUESTION:

That is not an objection, in its --

7

in itself, that goes to the question presented here, the

8

fact that you think it's a one-sided contract.

9

there are lots of one-sided contracts that are enforced.

10

MR. WHATLEY:

I mean,

Well, that's true, but I think it

11

has to be taken into the mix.

12

right, there -- there are one-sided contracts that are

13

enforced, and -- and lots of one-sided arbitration

14

contracts that are enforced, but --

15

QUESTION:

That -- that's absolutely

I'm not clear on what you lose at the

16

end of the day if you let the arbitrator decide whether

17

there was a RICO violation, and if there is such a

18

violation, then you reach the remedy issue, and if the

19

arbitrator were somehow to take the position that treble

20

damages were not available, I assume that could then be

21

resolved in court, could it not?

22

at the end of the day?

23

MR. WHATLEY:

I mean, what do you lose

Well, here's -- here's the problem

24

with that, especially if you read the -- the Eleventh

25

Circuit RICO decisions.

The issue of remedy --

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

2

MR. WHATLEY:

-- and -- and in cases like Sykes,

3

and I apologize, this is going beyond what's in the

4

briefs, but I'm trying to answer your question.

5

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

6

MR. WHATLEY:

And -- and in cases like Sykes,

7

the issue of damages, either to the individual plaintiffs,

8

or the damages to the class --

9

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

MR. WHATLEY:

10

-- are so wound up in the question

11

of RICO violation that what you're left with, then, is

12

trying the case twice if you do it the way you suggest.

13

Now --

14

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

If the

15

damages initially are compensatory, I mean, the difference

16

between punitive damages and these treble damages is, you

17

get a number that's compensatory, and then you multiply it

18

by three.

19

the limit, so I don't understand your answer about it

20

being bound up with anything -- it's -- it's an ordinary

21

measure of compensatory damages that the judge, the

22

arbitrator or the judge, whichever forum you're in,

23

triples.

24
25

It's not, you send it to the jury and the sky's

MR. WHATLEY:

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, I

thought I was answering the question of -- of what's the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

problem with trying violation first, assuming the

2

arbitrator couldn't award damages, and then trying damages

3

later.

4

QUESTION:

But I thought that you were answering

5

that question, but you're saying the reason you can't try,

6

was there a RICO violation first, is that the remedy is

7

inextricably bound up with --

8

MR. WHATLEY:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's right.

-- the answer to that question.

MR. WHATLEY:

That's right, so if the arbitrator

11

couldn't award damages in the first place, you would be

12

trying damages in the first instance.

13

a determination of violation, and then you would go back

14

somewhere else, presumably, and try the question of

15

remedy, and you would retry the question of damages.

You would only get

16

QUESTION:

I don't follow that.

17

QUESTION:

No, but if the arbitrator can award

18

simple damages --

19

MR. WHATLEY:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

If the arbitrator --

-- one times one damages, then that

objection doesn't apply.
MR. WHATLEY:

Then that takes away that

23

objection, but I didn't understand that to be the question

24

I was asked.

25

QUESTION:

And that may -- and that may be what

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the arbitrator decides.
MR. WHATLEY:

Well, it -- it -- it could be what

3

the arbitrator decides.

4

wrote out there, and under our reading of no punitive

5

damages, after this Court has developed the concept of

6

punitive damages in Gore, so -- I mean, there's almost a

7

presumed trebling issue there, that if you get much below

8

that, beyond that, there become constitutional questions.

9

Under our reading of what United

With -- with the development of that, then --

10

then we don't see there -- we see severe problems,

11

especially as that law developed, and especially as the

12

tax, your -- your -- based on your tax decisions, saying

13

treble damages are punitive damages.

14

QUESTION:

And we've also said that --

15

QUESTION:

It seems to me that what you're --

16

you're -- you're doing is, you're saying that it's

17

necessary for us to declare the -- the scope of the

18

arbitration in court before the arbitration proceeds.

19

That's what the argument amounts to --

20

MR. WHATLEY:

21

QUESTION:

No --

-- and I think that's inconsistent

22

with the whole idea of the efficiencies to be obtained by

23

the arbitral process.

24
25

MR. WHATLEY:

What -- what I'm saying is much

more limited than that, Your Honor.

What I'm saying is

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that in instances where someone like United or Pacificare

2

decides not only to insist on an arbitration agreement but

3

also to place limits on what the remedies are that the

4

arbitrator can award, and that's what they did here, in

5

those instances, the Court should look at what those

6

limitations are on remedies and make a public policy

7

determination if there's a Federal statutory claim out

8

there.

9

QUESTION:

Well, then you're opening up --

10

you're really expanding the gateway concept.

11

words, you're no longer talking about, did the parties

12

agree to submit this to arbitration.

13

remedial terms.

14

MR. WHATLEY:

In other

You're talking about

Well, Your Honor, remedy is

15

different than procedure, and -- and -- and -- and as I

16

read Howsam -- and obviously, I mean, you know, it's a

17

fresh opinion.

18

am, but as I read Howsam, it draws the procedural,

19

substantive distinction.

20

issues, and remedies can have a direct impact on public

21

policy questions, and so for that limited area --

22

You all are all much closer to it than I

QUESTION:

Remedies are not procedural

Well, but of course, you can say

23

procedural issues will have an impact on public policy

24

issues, too.

25

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, you certainly can, and if

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

they go far enough, and I think that's what you were

2

saying in Green Tree, had the record gone far enough in

3

Green Tree, what the Court -- the court said, there could

4

be instances where the limitations that are placed on,

5

procedurally on getting to arbitration go far enough that

6

they void the arbitration clause --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WHATLEY:

9

We --- but the record there didn't go

far enough.
QUESTION:

10

Well, and we didn't -- we did not

11

express a view as to what the situation would be if the

12

record had been different.

13

might.

14

MR. WHATLEY:

We simply said, conceivably it

That -- that -- that's true, Your

15

Honor, which I assume, and courts below I think are now,

16

there are situations where records are being developed

17

further to determine, so that the trial courts can make

18

that determination, has the remedy, has the arbitration

19

process been so impeded by those procedural issues that

20

you can't enforce it.

21

QUESTION:

Could two parties agree in advance

22

that if a RICO violation comes up they will only have

23

double damages, nothing about arbitration, just in court?

24

MR. WHATLEY:

25

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

They cannot?

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

MR. WHATLEY:

QUESTION:

3

Can -- can you do it in an antitrust

case?

4

MR. WHATLEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WHATLEY:

7

No.

Can you ever do it?
In -- in our judgment, Your Honor,

you -- you cannot do it.
QUESTION:

8
9

No.

Can two parties agree in a tort suit

that -- before there's a tort committed, that if there is

10

a tort, no damages greater than a million dollars in

11

punitives will be collected?

12

MR. WHATLEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WHATLEY:

15

QUESTION:

It depends on the State law.

So why doesn't it -That's a State law question.

-- but under Federal law you

16

cannot -- it's void against public policy to limit in any

17

way any possible damages in a future lawsuit?

18

MR. WHATLEY:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Your Honor, in Mc --

Is there -- has that been decided?

I -MR. WHATLEY:

In McMahon you said that -- that

22

parties cannot waive securities, future securities

23

violations even if there was a deal so that you got a

24

lower -- a lower payment for the transaction.

25

In Barrentine you said, either parties or unions

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

can't respectively waive Fair Labor Standards Act

2

violations in the future.

3
4

QUESTION:

The question didn't go to waiving the

violations.

5

MR. WHATLEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WHATLEY:

I --

It went only to the remedy.
It went to remedy, and what you've

8

got, Your Honor, I think is, Congress has established what

9

that remedy is, and I think it would be void as against

10
11

public policy.

I mean --

QUESTION:

But you then want us to adopt a

12

specific gateway rule when any arbitration agreement

13

limits a statutory remedy, and that statutory violation

14

would be arbitrable, and as I understand it, your rule is,

15

any limitation in an arbitration agreement of statutory

16

remedy raises a question of public policy, a question of

17

public policy is a gateway arbitrability question, and it

18

always goes to the court first.

19

MR. WHATLEY:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WHATLEY:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WHATLEY:

Is --

Yes, sir.

Is that a fair statement -Yes, sir.

For that --

-- your position?
For that limited issue of, did the

24

-- did the limitation, is there a limitation on the remedy

25

authorized by Congress.

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And that's, I guess you want to say

2

for -- leaving arbitration out of it, that sounds very

3

far-reaching, because I would have thought the matter

4

might have varied, depending upon the statute.

5

would have thought Congress could sometimes pass a statute

6

with remedies, that it would not be against public policy

7

for two private persons to limit --

8

MR. WHATLEY:

9

QUESTION:

I mean, I

Your Honor, Congress --

Was it always -- in your view,

10

always, no matter what the statute, two people cannot say

11

in advance, we will, if there should -- should a violation

12

arise, we will agree that, in advance, that the limitation

13

will not exceed $10 million -- or the damages won't

14

exceed -- put in some reasonable amount?

15
16
17

MR. WHATLEY:

I suppose in theory Congress could

say, in the act, parties can waive this respectively.
QUESTION:

It's only waiving, putting a

18

limitation on damages.

19

MR. WHATLEY:

Congress -- Congress has not done

20

that, and yes, Your Honor, that is our position.

21

Congress establishes a remedy for a violation, and I think

22

this is discussed in much more detail in the Public

23

Citizen amicus brief that's submitted than it was in our

24

briefs, because we were trying to address the specific --

25

QUESTION:

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

If

MR. WHATLEY:

-- arbitration issues and

2

limitations within arbitration, which is the issue before

3

this Court.
QUESTION:

4

Well, but that's -- I think Vimar

5

cuts the other way, so the COGSA -- COGSA was certainly a

6

statute enacted by Congress.
MR. WHATLEY:

7

And -- and the Court said, it's

8

not clear here whether that's going to be followed or not

9

followed.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. WHATLEY:

I think you said, it is not clear

12

to us whether that will be followed or not followed in

13

this instance, and that's --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WHATLEY:

16
17
18
19
20

If -That's why you allowed it to

proceed.
QUESTION:

If your view was correct, that whole

issue should have gone to a judge beforehand.
MR. WHATLEY:
don't read that.

Well, except that there's no -- I

There are two issues --

21

QUESTION:

You don't what?

22

MR. WHATLEY:

I don't read that as saying

23

specifically that that act would not be followed, number

24

one, their contract.

25

Number two, there is the separate consideration

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there, as in Mitsubishi, of the concerns about

2

international, of international relations, where you have

3

said you've got to be especially hands off, and that issue

4

is not involved here.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but what's involved, which is

6

identical, is the kind of prudential consideration for

7

courts, don't decide a difficult issue unless you have to.

8

Now, in Vimar it just said, look, we may never have to

9

decide this.

10
11

Send it to the arbitrator and see.

Now what you've suggested is to my mind a pretty
tough issue.

12

MR. WHATLEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well --

And we may never have to decide it,

or at least not soon.

15

MR. WHATLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, you might not.

Yes.
You might not, but it's not just,

18

it's a tough issue, send it to the arbitrator and let the

19

arbitrator decide.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The arbitrator will interpret the

contract to see if it really arises.
MR. WHATLEY:

But Number 2, it's also in an

23

international setting, where we've got to be, be, you

24

know, be concerned about that and grant all possible

25

deference to that situation.

1

If there are not other questions --

2

QUESTION:

I have one question, and it's about

3

something that the petitioner represented in the

4

petitioners' brief at note 12, page 23.

5

The petitioner represented to us that you

6

represented to this Court that if any issue is sent to

7

arbitration you simply will give up the claim, that you

8

will not arbitrate any issue in this case.

9

take that position, that -- is this representation

10

correct, that you have disclaimed any intention to

11

arbitrate any claim sent to arbitration?

12

MR. WHATLEY:

Do you still

Your Honor, that gets back to the

13

problem that I was addressing before.

14

a claim by claim basis are so small that you cannot take

15

them to arbitration.

16

QUESTION:

The claims here on

Well, let's take the RICO claim.

If

17

you lose on where that goes first, if it goes to

18

arbitration first, are you -- are you saying that you will

19

not -- that you will abandon the case anyway?

20

MR. WHATLEY:

Well, it's not abandoning the

21

case, Your Honor, because there is a separate conspiracy

22

and aiding and abetting claim that is going forward that

23

is not up before this Court.

24

QUESTION:

But I mean the --

25

MR. WHATLEY:

And the claim here, if we have to

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- have to resolve those, even the RICO claims, even if

2

you treble $5 to get $15, if we have to try those on a

3

claim by claim basis, in terms of what the doctors'

4

damages are, it can't be done, and we will not proceed.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

But why would the trial be different

in court versus arbitration on that?
MR. WHATLEY:

Well, because -- and -- and -- and

8

I know you're going to address this issue in Basil to some

9

extent, but the issue in court, the issues have been

10

certified in the court, so they're proceeding as a class

11

action, which is the only way that -- that claims of this

12

magnitude can be handled, and so that's our problem.

13

we could proceed in arbitration on a class-wide basis,

14

sure we would do it, and -- and doing that in the Federal

15

system has limits thus far, but -- but proceeding on a

16

claim by claim basis, where the damages are $5, $10, $15,

17

$50 for the bundling down claim --

Have you gotten a certification of

anything in the district court?

QUESTION:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAUER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

How broad is it? Is it Nationwide?
Yes, Your Honor, it's Nationwide.

Thank you, Mr. Whatley.
Thank you, Your Honors.

Mr. Grauer, you have 3 minutes left.

MR. GRAUER:

Mr. Whatley's argument about $5

11

here and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the

12

district judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our

13

cert petition that the court found that these cases were

14

negotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the

15

claims were not small, that in fact the doctors were

16

enlarging an ongoing pattern -- that's about midway

17

through page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an

18

ongoing pattern of instances.

19

Mr. Whatley's comment about the -- the

20

conspiracy claim has been certified and is going forward

21

is exactly an example of the problem.

22

simply a remedy that's -- that --

23

liability for an underlying cause of action, and the

24

arbitration clauses in this case require the doctors to

25

arbitrate all of their disputes with the managed care

Conspiracy is

a way of creating

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

companies, and they're trying to circumvent that on a mass

2

basis both in this appeal and by trying to say that the

3

conspiracy claims are not part of the arbitration clause,

4

and we don't think that's appropriate, and we think when

5

we talk about remedies in our cert petition, that would

6

include methods of holding someone liable for a claim, and

7

the Court ought to take a look at that in the record of

8

the case.

9

But I would agree fundamentally with a point

10

that I -- I thought I heard Justice Souter making a moment

11

ago, and that is that if Mr. Whatley's premise that any

12

remedial limitation becomes a gateway issue of

13

arbitrability, we are throwing -- we are overruling Howsam

14

after only a few weeks, because the whole point of Howsam

15

was, you look to whether the parties made an agreement to

16

arbitrate, and you look to whether the dispute is in the

17

scope of the agreement.

18

And here, at page A40 of our petition, the Court

19

finds this is an exceptionally broad arbitration

20

agreement.

21

Court found that.

22

all of the claims are within the scope of it, and it is

23

complete speculation to suggest that that, that any of

24

these claims are not within the scope of the arbitration

25

agreement.

It includes any and all controversies, and the
That has never been appealed.

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

Every --

1

The -- the -- with re -- a final point with

2

reference to the intent of the parties.

The parties would

3

intend an arbitrator to decide remedial limitations, and

4

the reason why the parties would intend the arbitrator to

5

decide that is because the parties have agreed to

6

arbitrate.

7

never intend to go to court at all.

8

go to arbitration and comply with their agreement, and the

9

question of remedies would be the last thing that would

10

come up in the event, on a speculative basis, that they

11

prevail, and they ought not to be able to get away from

12
