ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. OLSON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Based upon years of experience, study, hearings,

11
12

and overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded

13

that the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing

14

serious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to

15

control its borders.

16

removal proceedings was considered vital by Congress to

17

effectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade

18

removal, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal

19

aliens.

20

Detention of these aliens during

This is a facial substantive due process

21

challenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets

22

of -- no set of circumstances under which the

23

congressional policy would be constitutional.

24

As this Court has repeatedly --

25

QUESTION:

General Olson, do -- do we have

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authority to entertain this challenge?

2

amicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think

3

did it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well.

4

certainly did it early on here.

5

As you know, an

It

The problem is section 1126(e) which says, no

6

court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney

7

General under this section regarding the detention or

8

release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial

9

of bond or parole.

Now, is that provision, number one,

10

inapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional?

11

neither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no

12

authority to entertain this case?

13

MR. OLSON:

And if

Justice Scalia, it's the

14

Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals,

15

that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus

16

challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,

17

that the language of that provision relates to challenges

18

to an action by the Attorney General or administrative

19

action and does not preclude a challenge.

20

QUESTION:

No.

It doesn't -- doesn't say the

21

challenge -- no.

22

action by the Attorney General.

23

for here is that we set aside the Attorney General's

24

action in detailing -- in detaining this alien.

25

It says, no court may set aside any

MR. OLSON:

And -- and what is asked

It's -- it's our submission, after

position that you've suggested in court proceedings.

was rejected by three courts of appeals.

the conclusion that those decisions were correct and it

6

would not preclude -- and we're not contending here

today --

9

We studied it

The Government studied it further and came to

QUESTION:

8

It

And -- and you're relying on what

language to -MR. OLSON:

10

Well, we're relying on the language

11

that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the

12

statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the

13

Attorney General or immigration -- administrative action

14

by administrative officials, and this Court's construction

15

of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges

16

to other statutes.
QUESTION:

17

Oh, but all of those other statutes

18

had some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just

19

is no wiggle room here.

20

review.

21

by the Attorney General under this section.

22

It doesn't refer to judicial

It simply says, no court may set aside any action

QUESTION:

Even in the Quirin case where the --

23

the presidential order said that the people shall have no

24

access to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear

25

whether that sort of a provision was constitutional or

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not.
MR. OLSON:

2

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

and while it would be in the Government's interest to

4

preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of

5

the Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the

6

decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --

7

would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this

8

action in this case.

9

construction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the

10

Government in this case, but we've carefully examined it,

11

and we think that we're not advocating that position here

12

today.
QUESTION:

13

Of course, that would lead -- your

Well, I appreciate your carefully

14

examining it, but I'd still like to know what language in

15

it leads your careful examination to conclude that it does

16

not cover this case.

17

that's another matter.

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

reason.

I mean, if it's unconstitutional,

Well, we -- we may be -Maybe we'll strike it down for that

But my goodness -MR. OLSON:

We -- we may be wrong, Justice

22

Scalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second

23

sentence which says, no court may set aside any action or

24

decision by the Attorney General under this section.

25

does not state -- and -- and we think the Court would

It

construe it as not precluding a challenge to the

2

constitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the

3

Congress itself in enacting -QUESTION:

4

It doesn't refer to the issue.

It

5

doesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is

6

done.

7

other than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis.

8

says, no court may set aside any action by the --

9

It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds

It

I understand, Justice Scalia, and

10

the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that

11

position in early proceedings in this case.

12

rejected by three courts of appeals.

13

different conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our

14

position here today.

15

It was

We came to a

As this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress

16

has exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,

17

immigration, and the Nation's borders.

18

QUESTION:

Can I have a quick answer just to --

19

you said a facial challenge.

20

a challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a

21

plausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him

22

because he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --

23

petty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the

24

category of crimes.

25

wrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who

I've been assuming that it's

I don't know if that's right or

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system?
MR. OLSON:

2

Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the

3

case has not been litigated on that basis from its very

4

beginning.

5

appendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,

6

articulates the requested relief by the -- by the

7

respondent in this case.

8

that this provision is unconstitutional on its face as

9

violative --

I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint

QUESTION:

10

Petitioner seeks a declaration

It uses those words, I know.

I just

11

don't know how to consider it that way.

I mean, a person

12

who had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider

13

it on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get

14

the removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim

15

whatsoever.

16

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

-- or somebody like the plaintiff

MR. OLSON:

If this -- not only is it in the

20
21

Well -Is that who I'm supposed to consider?
Well, it --

here?

22

petition for habeas corpus that the individual was

23

challenging on its face, the district court considered it

24

on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that

25

basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- by the respondent on that basis.

2

be an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of

3

other considerations.

4

If there was to

And -- and this -- as this Court has said, the

5

facial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set

6

of circumstances under which the congressional policy

7

would be upheld.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. OLSON:

10

QUESTION:

11

the group somewhat?

12

the district court said the whole thing falls.

13

the Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --

14

what was it?

15

not taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of

16

the total group.

17

General Olson, didn't -There -- there's been no --- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow
I thought that in the district court,

Lawful permanent residents.

QUESTION:

I thought

And so that was

I had the same question.

It's at 6a

18

of the petition for the appendix.

The court of appeals,

19

in the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short

20

of affirming the holding that it's facially

21

unconstitutional.

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

QUESTION:

We affirm the grant of habeas corpus

24

on the ground the statute is unconstitutional as applied

25

to him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

United States.
MR. OLSON:

2

Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the

3

Ninth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and

4

on page 30a.

5

issue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality

6

of the statute with respect to a broad class of

7

individuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent

8

residents.

9

to unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the

10

But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was

That's the equivalent of a facial decision as

people covered.

And -- and --

QUESTION:

11

So it's your position, in effect,

12

that although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied

13

challenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it

14

facially.

15

MR. OLSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

what it did.

19
20
21

O'Connor.

It just narrowed the description of

Is that right?

MR. OLSON:

18

Yes, Justice --

That's -- that is correct, Justice

That's -QUESTION:

But it -- but it struck it facially

only with respect to the permanent resident aliens.

22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. OLSON:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
To permanent resident aliens.
That's correct.
Sort of half-facial.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. OLSON:

Mostly facial.
Mostly facial.

That's -- that is what the Ninth

6

Circuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case

7

must be considered under those circumstances as a facial

8

challenge.

9

As I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said

10

that in connection with immigration and protecting the

11

Nation's borders, there is no power at which there is more

12

deference to congressional judgment, no authority under

13

the Constitution granted more to the political branches,

14

particularly to Congress.

15

this Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be

16

unacceptable if applied to citizens.

17

QUESTION:

Congress regularly makes rules,

Is there a regulation or -- or is

18

there a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the

19

INS which says that there has to be a conviction before

20

you utilize this section?

21

has information that a felony has been committed, is that

22

sufficient to detain?

23

MR. OLSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. OLSON:

Or if the Attorney General just

Well, the statute -Here there was a conviction.
Here there was a conviction, and

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is specifically what is said in the statute itself.

2

It's my understanding --

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Well, the statute itself talks about

a conviction.
MR. OLSON:

Absolutely.

And -- and what happens

6

in practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal

7

proceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if

8

possible, during the period of incarceration of the

9

individual, or immediately upon release from

10
11

incarceration.
So we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --

12

this provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of

13

the removal proceeding itself, which was carefully

14

distinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of

15

2 years ago.

16

decision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent

17

detention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a

18

distinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago

19

in the Carlson case involving members of the Communist

20

Party, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of

21

keeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had

22

a full panoply of due process, having been convicted

23

beyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --

24
25

This is on -- compared to that Zadvydas

QUESTION:

Yes, but General, it is true, is it

not, that there are people in the class who might have

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been convicted even before the statute was passed.

2

you're not just -- just continuing detention.

3

go out and find them and -- and put them under detention.

4

MR. OLSON:

So

You have to

It's my understanding, Justice

5

Stevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute

6

was passed.

7

I'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal.

8

that to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that

9

that might be true and I might be mistaken, that would

I may be misunderstanding that, and if so,
But

10

only illustrate why this is a facial challenge.

11

statute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,

12

particularly in connection with individuals convicted

13

afterwards.

14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

The

What -- what about this particular

individual?
MR. OLSON:

This was after the statute was

passed, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

General Olson, you've -- you've put

19

in statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don't

20

show up for the hearings and the -- the rather low

21

percentage of those who are ultimately deported from the

22

class that don't show up and so on.

23

On your view of the Government's authority

24

over -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,

25

would our -- in your judgment should our decision be the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

same regardless of those statistics?

2

nothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people,

3

should we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be

4

obligated to defer and simply say it's up to the

5

Government?

6

MR. OLSON:

If you had told us

Well, I think Justice Souter, the

7

answer to that is that the test that the Court has

8

consistently applied in this area is there -- is there a

9

rational basis, is the congressional objective rationally

10

likely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose.

11

Those statistics that we set forth in our brief and which

12

were before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,

13

provide the purpose for which Congress acted.

14

QUESTION:

Well -- well, is that rational basis

15

review the one we would employ in reviewing legislation

16

passed by Congress concerning immigration policy?

17

have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means

18

of effectuating those policies?

19

questions?

20

and to say what it does versus the implementation of it.

21
22

Are -- are there separate

I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law

MR. OLSON:

Well, under certain circumstances,

the Court has used that language.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. OLSON:

25

And

Right.
The -- the means to achieve the

objective --

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. OLSON:

3

Yes.
-- will be looked at possibly

separately.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. OLSON:

Yes.
But it seems to me -- and it seems

6

obvious particularly in this case -- that the means are

7

wrapped up in the objective itself.
What -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a

8
9

very difficult problem of a certain category or groups of

10

aliens that were committing serious crimes in this

11

country.
QUESTION:

12

Well, does -- is -- does that -- do

13

your statistics define that category as the -- the legal

14

permanent resident aliens or all aliens?

15

latter.
MR. OLSON:

16
17
18

I think it's the

Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,

it's all.
QUESTION:

But if it -- if it is the latter,

19

then I don't know that the statistics tell us anything one

20

way or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,

21

the -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect to

22

the class that we've got under consideration here.

23

MR. OLSON:

What the statistics tell us is that

24

there were large numbers of aliens committing serious

25

crimes and that those -- those individuals committing

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that

2

they were -- that class of individuals or those groups of

3

individuals were cultivating a criminal class that was

4

engaging in organized -QUESTION:

5

But, General Olson, those statistics

6

go to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation,

7

not of the likelihood of flight which this statute is

8

directed at.

9

MR. OLSON:

10

QUESTION:

Well -As I understand the statistics --

11

correct me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of

12

showing up at the hearing itself, which this statute

13

protects, 80 percent of the people do show up.

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. OLSON:

Well, 80 percent -Is that correct?
Well, the -- the statistics have to

17

be looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --

18

20 percent of the -QUESTION:

19
20

Eight out of 10 of these criminals

show up.

21

MR. OLSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. OLSON:

25

Well, no.
That's very comforting.

In that -- that -- well, actually

the -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because that figure of 20 percent who absconded were

2

people that had been, during this period of time, been

3

given individualized hearings.

4

after a hearing, the authorities thought were probably

5

likely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did.

6

you look at -QUESTION:

7
8

They were the ones that,

When

But -- but they include all aliens

and not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.
MR. OLSON:

9

Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no

10

question that there were large numbers of lawful permanent

11

resident aliens that were evading the deportation

12

proceeding itself.

13

Once the deportation --

aliens in the class did show up for the hearing without

being detained?

23

It's very important to
We're

That's what this statute is

And am I not correct that 80 percent of the

that?

13

MR. OLSON:

Am I not right on

I -- I respectfully disagree in this

sense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --

15

the removal period itself, he will be in custody at the

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, and the Government --

So why can't the immigration judge at

10

the end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,

11

and B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you go

12

away?
MR. OLSON:

Well, but this -- let me answer it

this way.

serious problem.

There are such large numbers of

20 percent.
MR. OLSON:

But that 20 percent, Justice

Stevens -- and it's explained in the brief.

20 percent were the individuals for which there had been

an individualized hearing given during that period of time

when that process was taking place.

MR. OLSON:

Well, it -- it appeared -- it

appeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration

authorities to be a reasonably tough standard.
The problem with criminal aliens is that once --

they may not get deported is the Attorney General might

That is correct.

Well, given --

Given that, General Olson, that we're

only talking about people who have acknowledged -- you

10

know, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,

11

who have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we

12

have to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or

13

90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will

14

flee?

15

unreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be

at large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no

17

right to be at large.

he's already committed a crime in this country.

-- that a large number of them will

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

No.

I'm simply --

It seems to me that even if none of

7

them would flee, if they have no right to be here, if

8

they've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be

9

held in -- in custody until they leave?

10

MR. OLSON:

This -- we may well be here on

11

another occasion defending a broader policy.

12

emphasize the facts that distinguish what you're

13

suggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas

14

case, an immense difference that exists between the

15

circumstances here, and the circumstances under those

16

circumstances.

17

QUESTION:

But let me

Before you get to -- to Zadvydas and

18

the distinction, you -- you make, I take it, no

19

distinction between lawful permanent residents and people

20

who are excludable.

21

residents have many rights in common with citizens.

22

Indeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect

23

classification.

24

seems to me you're making no distinction at all.

25

People who are lawful permanent

But as far as this case is concerned, it

MR. OLSON:

The statute makes no distinction.

The Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to

excludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,

3

the statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,

4

the statute was constitutional.
What we -- the statute doesn't make that

5
6

distinction, but what it does do is it provides for a

7

brief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not

8

potentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'

9

authorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable

10

doubt with -QUESTION:

11

But it might be of a crime that

12

they -- one of the claims here is that this is not a

13

qualifying plot -- crime.

14

that may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your

15

reading, or under this statute, someone would not be able

16

to get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a

17

crime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious

18

offenses.

19

MR. OLSON:

I don't get into that box.

That's the question that I believe I

addressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --

2

is --

3

QUESTION:

In other words, for the class that

4

we're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about

5

lawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on

6

whether their continuing residence is lawful.

7

they are determined to be deportable.

8

lawful resident aliens.

MR. OLSON:

QUESTION:

They --

They are no longer

That -- that is correct.
Well, General Olson, aren't they

11

lawful resident aliens until an order is entered that they

12

be deported?

13

MR. OLSON:

What they are is what -- they are --

14

they are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of

All right.

So at the -- at the point

17

of the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, the

18

Joseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,

19

there is no order that they be deported, and they,

20

therefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,

21

as lawful resident aliens.

22

MR. OLSON:

They -- however, they have -- they

have been convicted after due process of a crime that

Congress considers serious, and they're being held for a

11

Ms. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether Congress

17

authorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clause

18

permits a statute that requires that lawful permanent

19

residents like our client be imprisoned throughout the

20

duration of removal proceedings.

21

QUESTION:

Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a

22

response to the jurisdiction problem?

23

possible that despite the Government's failure to raise

24

it, that we could do so.

25

I mean, it's

And why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to

Alderson Reporting Company

keep hands off?
MS. RABINOVITZ:

2

Yes, Your Honor.

We agree with

3

the Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did

4

not -QUESTION:

5
6

it.

I have to tell you I don't understand

I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9

This -- this statute contains

no express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction.

10

That's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, and

11

based on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,

12

absent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's still

13

jurisdiction in --

14

QUESTION:

How could that language not repeal
No court may set aside any action by

15

habeas jurisdiction?

16

the Attorney General under this section.

17

can that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpus

18

unless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General

19

under this section?

20

habeas corpus?

How can -- how

How can that possibly not set aside

21

MS. RABINOVITZ:

22

QUESTION:

But this Court has said --

I mean, now, maybe you want to argue

23

it's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't do

24

this is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.

25

QUESTION:

Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said something

2

very much like that, didn't it, that you had to be very

3

specific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction?

4

MS. RABINOVITZ:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes.

Try Johnson v. Robson too.
The point is that this statute

7

requires the Government to detain individuals like our

8

client who are lawful permanent residents not because

9

their detention is necessary to protect the public from

10

danger of flight risk, but merely because they were

11

convicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes

12

that the Government believes may render them deportable.
QUESTION:

13
14

believes it.

Can -- you say the Government

The Congress believed it, did it not?

MS. RABINOVITZ:

15

Well, Your Honor, the question

16

that remains to be determined in all these cases is

17

whether an individual is, in fact, deportable.

18

did decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an

19

individual deportable and these individuals have been

20

convicted of crimes.

Congress

But the fact --

21

QUESTION:

What more do we need?

22

MS. RABINOVITZ:

The fact that they've been

23

convicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that

24

it's a crime that renders them deportable under the

25

statute.

And I think that this addresses, in part,

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is this

2

just that they're suspected of committing crimes or have

3

they been convicted of crimes.

your client was convicted, was he not?

MS. RABINOVITZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9
10
11
12
13

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --

So -He was convicted, but there

still is a question about whether his conviction actually
renders him deportable.
QUESTION:

And what question is that?

Does

Congress in the statute set forth the crimes?
MS. RABINOVITZ:

No, Your Honor.

Congress sets

14

forth a -- a broad category of crimes that can render

15

somebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broad

16

category that are labeled aggravated felonies.

17

The question, though -- and this is a question

18

that has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is

19

whether a conviction is an aggravated felony.

Is -- is

He gets a hearing, Your Honor,

Is that the point?

MS. RABINOVITZ:

2

Yes, although, Your Honor, it

3

does say that the Government is not substantially unlikely

4

to prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable.

5

So -- and essentially it --

6

QUESTION:

So it --

7

MS. RABINOVITZ:

-- it says that there is

8

reason -- there's a possibility.

9

you will be found deportable.

It's not impossible that

You -- that it's not --

10

since the Government is not substantially unlikely to

11

prevail on the charge.
I think it's important to recognize that there

12
13

are many individuals who are subjected to mandatory

14

detention under this statute who cannot satisfy that

15

standard.

16

and the court has held the Government substantially -- you

17

know, we can't show that the Government is substantially

18

unlikely to prevail.

19

In fact, that that -- they've had that hearing

MS. RABINOVITZ:

QUESTION:

Yes --

-- so long -- so long as you get a

the Government ought to be able to hold you, an alien who

has no right to be at large in this country, until you

leave.

23

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Let me try -- let me try to

24

explain how the statute works and why we believe that it's

25

a problem.

The -- the proceeding that you're asking for,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

a determination about whether, in fact, an individual is

deportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is

3

for, and that kind of decision is not made the first time

4

you come before an immigration judge.

protracted process, and we have individuals who have --

6

who have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration

8

Scalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which

9

is why we say that the relevant question is whether

It's often a very

pending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in

11

detaining that individual.

12

QUESTION:

And we're not --

Well, and the -- the Government

answers that there's a substantial number of people who

14

don't show up for these hearings, and that's the purpose

QUESTION:

But this Court looks to the

We don't allow people to

Look at Carlson against Landon.

I mean, that certainly was a class, not an individual.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

2

Justice.

I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently.

3

In Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney

4

General's discretionary decision that five individuals

5

could be detained because there was -- that -- the

6

decision to detain them was with not -- was not without

7

reasonable foundation.

8

It's wholly different from this case.

It was a discretionary decision.

What makes this statute so unique and so

9
10

unprecedented is that the Government is prohibited.

11

There's no discretion here.

12

prohibited from releasing individuals like our client, a

13

lawful permanent resident who has a legal right to be

14

here, even when -QUESTION:

15

The Attorney General is

Well, who has the legal right to be

16

here, although he's been convicted of a crime which makes

17

him deportable.
MS. RABINOVITZ:

18

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

It's

not clear that this conviction makes him deportable.

people who show that they raise a substantial question --

MS. RABINOVITZ:

In this case, if we're talking

about somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like

our client, that would satisfy this case because this

it's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your

And -- and until the question of

Now, that doesn't strike me as terribly
unreasonable.

Just don't do the felony.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

3

Well, two points, Your Honor.

4

First, in this case, the conviction that is now being

5

considered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed

6

before the statute took effect.

7

Honor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.

So even under Your

In terms of what you're suggesting, though, if

Congress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an

10

issue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to

condition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that

12

individuals who are facing deportation, particularly

13

lawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair

14

hearing.

15

right to physical liberty --

16

QUESTION:

To say that those individuals must give up their

Well, but there's no question that

17

these people are going to get a fair hearing eventually.

18

The question you're challenging is whether they should

19

be -- be incarcerated pending that hearing.

20

talking about a fair hearing.

21

MS. RABINOVITZ:

So we're not

You're right, Your Honor,

22

Mr. Chief Justice.

But the -- the point is that if

23

somebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they

24

can't get the evidence for their case, because being

25

locked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

present their cases, there's no right to appointed

2

counsel.

It means they can't work.
There are -- and this is, again, where I would

3
4

like to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by

5

the Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points

6

out other cases where individuals gave up their claims

7

because otherwise they were going to be in detention for

8

so long.

9
10

And let me just point out one other -QUESTION:

Well, you -- you've got someone who

11

is an alien here.

12

I mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they

13

should have all these additional benefits so that somehow

14

they can avoid deportation.

15

The alien has committed a felony.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Well -- well, first of all,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who

17

are convicted of felonies.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Even the definition --

Well, but that's with the case we're

dealing of here.
MS. RABINOVITZ:

Okay, but the -- the question

21

is what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony.

22

Misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well.

23

You're right.

24
25

In this case, the initial conviction --

QUESTION:

What -- what do you -- what do you

mean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. RABINOVITZ:

I know it's somewhat shocking,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated

3

felony has been defined so broadly --

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. RABINOVITZ:

6
7

Well --- the courts have held that

even misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies.
QUESTION:

But there's no question that first

8

degree burglary is not a misdemeanor.

9

that's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?

10

MS. RABINOVITZ:

So, in our case,

But let me return to the point

11

about whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by

12

requiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout

13

the process of their deportation proceeding, a process

14

which, as I said, can be months, often years, without any

15

individualized determination of danger and flight risk.

16

And the example that I wanted to give ties back

17

with this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that

18

212(c) relief was available to individuals whose

19

convictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the

20

statute having taken effect.

21

were subject to mandatory detention under the statute.

22

Their claim would have been considered close to frivolous

23

until the Supreme Court ruled differently.

24
25

QUESTION:

All of those individuals

Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,

your argument to me rings true for people who have real

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

claims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who

2

has an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed

3

for purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a

4

very good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't

5

have any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and

6

if he wants to be deported quickly, he can be.

7

MS. RABINOVITZ:

8

QUESTION:

9

Your Honor, that's --

But if he has a substantial claim,

it's different.
MS. RABINOVITZ:

10

Your Honor, I think it's

11

important to recognize that that's precisely the kind of

12

factors that the Immigration Service and the immigration

13

judge looks at when they make a determination whether

14

somebody should be released on bond.

15

determining flight risk, that's precisely what they look

16

at.

17

frivolous claim.

18

on bond because they're not going to show up.

19

not saying that individuals in that situation should be

20

released from detention.

They -- when they're

They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a
We're not going to release this person
And we're

All that we're saying is that an individual

21
22

needs to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,

relief.

I'm not a flight risk.

6

QUESTION:

Your Honor, we have no --

In your -- in your regime, you

7

would -- would there be any problem putting the burden on

8

the alien to show that?
MS. RABINOVITZ:

9

We have no problem with

10

Congress creating a presumption that individuals who are

11

charged with these kinds of -- with being deportable for

12

these kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk,

13

and that they need to come forward to show that they're

14

not.

And in fact -QUESTION:

15

Well, but I -- I'll get to that in a

16

minute.

But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the

17

likelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a

18

moment.

19

substantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what

quite different.

7

latter, but --

And I would -- and I would doubt the

MS. RABINOVITZ:

8

Let me try to clarify what I

9

believe is some confusion about what that hearing does.

10

The hearing essentially just shows you need to show that

11

the Government has no frivolous claim.

12

what you need to show.

13

Government had -- that the Government's charge is

14

frivolous.

15

putting people into proceedings if they have no possible

16

argument.

17

throughout the whole deportation process just because they

18

cannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous

19

claim, that doesn't satisfy due process.

That's essentially

I mean, you have to show that the

And I would assume that the Government is not

But to require that an individual be locked up

In terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was

20
21

referring to -- what I thought you were referring to is

22

whether an individual is going to have an obligation to

show that they're not a danger of flight risk.

24

even --

25

But

Well, perhaps that's why I asked you

49

1

that question first.

2

concede that he has the burden, that that is really very,

very close to what the -- the statute already provides,

forgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or --

5

It -- it does seem to me that if you

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't --

6

I don't see it that way.

I see that the question about if

7

you need -- if an individual has to prove that the

8

Government's argument is frivolous, that's not the same

9

thing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim.

10

that's all that we're saying.

11

completely different.

12

Government's argument is frivolous.

I think that they're

claim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in

their proceedings.

whether an individual can be detained for a substantial

period of time without any opportunity to show that --

19

that there's no purpose that's served by their detention.

individualized determination.

and the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided

he poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar

bond.

He's now getting his college degree.

It's not a question of discretion like

And going back to your question about burden, I
think it's important to recognize that the regime that was

10

in place prior to this statute, and that is now in place

11

in those circuits where they've said that the statute

12

needs to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due

13

process requires an individualized determination, still

14

requires that an individual show that they are not a

15

danger of flight risk.

16

under this system, no individual who's a danger of flight

17

risk is going to be released except for those cases where

18

there's, you know, obviously going to be error.

19

general, individuals who are a danger of flight risk

20

aren't going to be released.

21

They bear that burden.

And so

But in

I think it -- there's one last point that I

22

would like to make because I realize my time is short,

23

which is that this case poses a serious constitutional

24

problem, and we believe that there is a way that this

25

Court can avoid that problem by construing the statute to

not apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact,

2

not deportable.
The statute says that individuals shall be

3
4

mandatorily detained.

5

one of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention.

6

As we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of

7

whether he is deportable remains very much to be decided.

8

He doesn't have any order of deportation.
QUESTION:

An individual who is deportable on

Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge

10

Fletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim?

11

Because the language is when the alien is released from

12

criminal custody.

13

MS. RABINOVITZ:

14

QUESTION:

Because --

The statute directs custody when the

15

alien is released from criminal custody, and not at some

16

later time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal

17

order.

18

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Because I think that what Judge

19

Fletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right

20

now that the Immigration Service has is to conduct

21

deportation proceedings while individuals are still

22

serving their criminal sentence, which makes complete

23

sense, because then you do not have this problem.

24

are already ordered deported, determined deportable while

25

they are still in jail.

it doesn't say at the later time of the final removal

There's two different issues,

Our point is only that there are

or a BIA decision that says they are deportable.
Now, they may still be seeking review of that

12

decision in the Federal courts, in which case, that

13

decision is not final and they would not fit under the

14

next statute, the statute that you -- that this Court

15

construed in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they

16

would -- or excuse me -- 1231.

an order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to

18

say that individual is deportable.

19

But they would still have

Whereas, here you have a situation where anybody

20

who the Government charges with being deportable -- in

21

this case, our client, even though he may not actually be

22

deportable -- is subject to mandatory detention for

23

possibly a year, 2 years, however long.

I see my time is up.

QUESTION:

no.

Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the

10

if there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the

11

statute in the view of the Government unconstitutional?

12

MR. OLSON:

No.

Now, we haven't briefed and

13

studied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that

14

I gave before.

15

with -- it would be within the power of Congress to do

16

that under certain circumstances.

QUESTION:

Well, you can rely on the presumption

of constitutionality if you haven't briefed it.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. OLSON:

21

Well, then I would've have to answer

the question differently.
Well, if -- I guess no, I guess I would --

MR. OLSON:

Let me just deal with a few things

that were raised during my colleague's argument.
First of all, the date of the offense that's

3
4

involved in this case was after the enactment of this

5

statute.

6

asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors

7

and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997.

8

when that conviction took place.

9

On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is

That was

Secondly -- and I think a lot of time has been

10

expended with respect to the question that focused in

11

large part by Justice Breyer.

12

the individual?

13

What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime

14

was one that should be covered?

15

What happens if it's not

What happens if he's really a citizen?

As we said on page 26 -- and we cite the

16

relevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types

17

of things can be challenged in an individualized bond

18

hearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit

19

was talking about and which is what our opponents are

20

talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at

21

that point, which is precisely what the respondents are

22

talking about.

23

So that's already built into the statute.

Now, one might quarrel with whether -- what the

24

burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it

25

should be written, but that's a -- this is a determination

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by the executive branch with respect to the statute.

If

2

the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely

3

to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then

4

the individual may be released on bond.

5

goes against the individual, that can be taken to the

6

Board of Immigration Appeals.

7

takes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you

8

put it.

If the decision

So there's a process that

Now, that does not deal with the question of

9
10

dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress

11

was concerned about when it -- when it enacted the

12

statute.

13

which large numbers of individuals who commit serious

14

crimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what

15

it thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes.

16

Congress was concerned about a situation in

Now, if there is some question about that in an

17

individual case, or if there's some question about an

18

aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to

19

this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge.

20

The respondent is saying here today that this is an

21

as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this

22

case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited

23

as a facial challenge, through the district court's

24

decision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial

25

challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

This has been a challenge to the congressional

2

determination that people who commit serious crimes are

3

to -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible.
They -- and -- and to the -- in order for that

4
5

policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected,

6

to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in

7

the United States that's operating freely, for a limited

8

period of time, that individual will be detained during

9

that process until the final order of deportation is

10
11

entered.
85 percent of the aliens that are brought into

these procedures don't even challenge the immigration

decision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half

of those cases are resolved within 30 days.
