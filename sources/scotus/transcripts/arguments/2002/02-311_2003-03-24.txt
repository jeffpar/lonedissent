CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Verrilli.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the clearly established law of Strickland

11

v. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a

12

client facing a death sentence must be supported either by

13

a thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional

14

judgment supporting limitation on investigation.

15

In this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals and

16

the Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively

17

unreasonable manner.

18

fulfill what this Court described in Williams against

19

Taylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate

20

thoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable

21

professional judgment in fact supports or could support

22

their failure to do so.

23

QUESTION:

Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not

Do you think the Williams case is a

24

white horse for you, that is, I mean, that it's exactly

25

identical to this case?

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. VERRILLI:

I do not think it's exactly

2

identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it

3

clearly informs this case both by explaining what an --

4

what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland

5

amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of

6

investigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as

7

a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices

8

about how best to defend your client.
QUESTION:

9
10

after the Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?
MR. VERRILLI:

11
12
13

But -- but wasn't Williams decided

Yes, it was Justice Scalia,

but -QUESTION:

So, therefore, it can't be used for

14

purposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an

15

unreasonable application of then-existing Federal law.

16

MR. VERRILLI:

I disagree with that, Justice

17

Scalia, for the following reason.

18

case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was

19

decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied.

20

Williams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a

21

2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by

22

definition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams

23

concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement,

24

means that that is what Strickland requires.

25

and -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond

Williams, like this

And that --

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

AEDPA in the least.

2

QUESTION:

3

Yet, you go back to Strickland and

you can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.
MR. VERRILLI:

4

Oh, no, no.

I disagree with

5

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

We think it's right on page 690

6

and 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that

7

we think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it,

8

that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has

9

either got to be based on complete investigation or, if

10

it's based on less than complete investigation, it's

11

reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional

12

judgment supports the limitation on investigation.

13

the rule.

14

QUESTION:

That's

Last year in Bell -- Bell versus

15

Cohen -- Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously

16

deferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in

17

a case like that.

18

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, but there's a fundamental

19

difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief

20

Justice, and it's this.

21

the failure to investigate.

22

counsel's decisions about what information to present to

23

the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a

24

thorough investigation.

25

Bell v. Cone was not a case about
That was purely a case about

And the reason that's critical is because as --

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference

2

given to counsel's choices about what to present is

3

premised on the adequacy of the investigation that

4

precedes them.

5

stance towards presentation is.

6

investigation.
QUESTION:

7
8

It's the adequacy of

Is that what this case is about,

Mr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?
MR. VERRILLI:

9
10

That is what the source of the deferential

This case is about both, but it's

principally about -QUESTION:

11

It would seem to me if it were, you

12

would have to establish pretty clearly that counsel did

13

not know these many things that you say he did not know.

14

And in fact, counsel was never asked the question, did you

15

know this, did you know that, did you know -- we don't

16

know what counsel -I -- I'm looking at the joint appendix on

17
18

page 490.

19

he's asked did you know that Wiggins had been removed from

20

his natural mother as a result of a finding of neglect and

21

abuse when he was 6 years old?

22

That was in the social service records.

23

Yes.

24
25

He knew a lot of these things.

He's -- he's --

Yes, he says, I knew that.
So you knew it.

You also knew that there were reports of sexual
abuse at one of the foster homes.

Yes, he knew that.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

You also knew he had his hands burned as a child

2

as a result of his mother's abuse of him.

3

that.
You also knew about homosexual overtures made

towards him by his Job Corps supervisor.

Yes.

Now, that -- that examination could have --

Yes.

And you also knew he was -- he was borderline

Yes, he knew

10

this, this, this, this, and this.

11

like that.

12

person's background, but we don't know that he didn't know

13

the rest of it.

15

18

I disagree with that, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

16
17

We know that he knew many things about this

MR. VERRILLI:

14

There's no examination

Well, how do we know that he didn't

know it?
MR. VERRILLI:

Well, here's how.

There -- there

19

are two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to

20

them, I think it's important to look at the very next

21

thing that the lawyer says in that colloquy.

22

next thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew

23

what was reported in other people's reports.

24

what led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion

25

it reached, which was that the social service records and

And the very

And that is

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the pre-sentence records, other people's reports,

2

contained that information, and we have shown by clear and

3

convincing evidence that they do not.
But there are two additional points that are

4
5

critical here, and the first one is this.

6

fact, the actual judge who heard that testimony -QUESTION:

7

The trier of

I -- I have to correct you.

That --

8

he -- he didn't say that all of this that he knew he only

9

knew because it was in other people's reports.

The

10

question was -- he had just said -- and you also knew that

11

he was borderline mentally retarded.

Yes.

12

He -- then another question is begun.

13

all -- he interrupts the question and he says, at least I

14

knew that as it was reported in other people's reports,

15

yes.

16

mentally retarded.

The that was the fact that he was borderline

MR. VERRILLI:

17
18

Justice Scalia, that is not how

the --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. VERRILLI:

21

You knew

it.

That's how it reads.
-- Maryland Court of Appeals read

It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.
QUESTION:

22

The court of appeals and the Fourth

23

Circuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it

24

reads.

25

MR. VERRILLI:

But -- but, Justice Scalia, what

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether

2

the court of appeals based its determination on an

3

unreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there

4

are two critical indicia here that it did.

5

one -- the first one is this.

Well, there are three.

First, the records don't contain the

6
7

The first

information.

8

Second, the trier of fact, the judge who heard

9

this testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and

10

606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer

11

who gave that testimony, did not know what was in the

12

social -- what was in the social history subsequently

13

prepared.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

This was in the trial itself or in a

State habeas proceeding?
MR. VERRILLI:

In the State habeas proceeding,

17

Your Honor.

18

during closing argument by the -- by the government in

19

that State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who

20

heard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess

21

credibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the

22

other evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it

23

was error.

24
25

His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and

And then -- and the next point that we think
conclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

know is this.

Remember that -- that at the close of the

2

sentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding,

4

counsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating

5

evidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury

6

had their motion to bifurcate been granted.

7

doesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that --

8

that we have shown in the social history -- doesn't

9

mention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his

That proffer

10

life.

11

It doesn't mention the sexual abuse.

12

the homelessness.

13

counsel would have withheld all of that information from

14

its proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of

15

the proceeding if counsel knew that and could --

16

It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident.
It doesn't mention

There's no conceivable reason why

QUESTION:

So that counsel referred to other

17

people's reports and other reports.

inference from the record that there were some reports

19

other than the -- I take it it's the social -- social

MR. VERRILLI:

They are not there.

from now that there could be other reports to which he was

referring which are not in this document and which might

3

be those other -- those other interviews with other

people, et cetera.

5

sit down -- it's -- it's one thing if I'm supposed to look

6

at this document and say did this lawyer investigate the

7

background, and the answer I think would be no.

8

quite another thing if he knew all kinds of other things

9

from other sources, namely about the burned hands, all the

Now, you're referring me one other thing, the

proffer.

13

the briefs, I suspect I will hear the following.

14

course, he didn't want to proffer this.

15

decision was to make the jury think that this man might

16

not have done it, and the more lunatic we make him sound,

17

the more the jury is going to think the opposite.

because I think this goes the essence of why the Maryland

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application

2

of -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this.

3

The proffer occurred in the following context.

4

Counsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the

5

sentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the

6

factual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they

7

could then put on the full-blown mitigation case.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

That would have involved the

principal issue had they -- as a separate -MR. VERRILLI:

Right.

Bifurcation would have

11

first involved the principalship, and then had

12

principalship been established to the jury's satisfaction,

13

they would have moved to the issue of mitigation.

14

the -- and the trial judge denied that motion.

15

denied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day

16

of the sentencing hearing.

17

sentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was

18

obviously to prepare both a principalship case and a

19

mitigation case because they made a motion that was

20

designed to allow them to do precisely that.

21

no conceivable justification for them to have failed to do

22

everything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop

23

a mitigation case.

24
25

And

Now, he

So up to the first day of the

So there is

And they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm
afraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the basis that Your Honor described for this reason.

2

point of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to

3

show the judge and to create a record on appeal of what

4

they would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and

5

they could have tried their mitigation case.

6

was their mitigation case.

7

QUESTION:

The

This proffer

What about the first part which was

8

Justice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts --

9

questions, which is when you read just the part that

10

Justice Scalia read to you -- and he says it's on the

11

basis of other people's reports -- will the other side

12

concede or how do we know it's -- what he's referring to

13

is this document rather than some other set of documents?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think what's critical in

15

that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found

16

because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual

17

findings made by a State court.

18

factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals

19

found -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the

20

petition in the -- in the second paragraph there.

21

it says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate

22

background.

23

pre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service

24

records documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse.

25

And what the -- and the

It --

They had available to them not only the

That is the sum and substance, the total, of

1

what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the

facts here.

3

finding --

4
5

It's the sole factual finding.

QUESTION:

That factual

Did it say, and nothing else?

Did it

say, and nothing else?

6

MR. VERRILLI:

7

QUESTION:

It said --

You're -- you're making it as though

8

it was a factual finding that this is all that he knew.

9

Now, they knew that he knew that, but they didn't make a

10
11

factual finding that he didn't know anything else.
MR. VERRILLI:

They -- the factual -- the only

12

factual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the

13

only thing that supports and explicates the general

14

statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were

15

aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual

16

finding that the social service records documented sexual

17

abuse and documented physical abuse.

18

and convincing evidence that that finding is wrong.

19

We've shown by clear

And then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is

20

whether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was

21

based on an -- an unreasonable factual determination.

22

we've shown that the only thing that they found --

23

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back

24

to the habeas -- the State habeas decision that you --

25

that you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix

page 604.

2

claim of failure to investigate, the burden is on you to

3

show that counsel did not know things that he would have

4

learned on investigation.

5

Now, as I understand it, if you're making a

The burden is on you.

As I read this court's decision, what the court

6

is simply saying is, I don't ever remember a death penalty

7

case where there was not a social history done.

8

was simply unthinkable not to have a social history.

9

And so it

Then when you go across the page, so, therefore,

10

based upon the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding

11

it was error for them not to investigate it because I

12

don't have any information before me to believe that they

13

did not have this information available to them.

14

You see the context?

And I understand what

15

you're saying, but the context of this case is that I have

16

no reason to believe that they did have all of this

17

information.

That's not -- that's not enough to satisfy

18

your burden.

That court would have had to find I believe

19

that they did not have this information, not I just have

20

no reason to believe that they had it.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

22

QUESTION:

But --

The court should have had to find

23

they did not have this information.

24

It just says I have no reason to believe that they had it.

25

MR. VERRILLI:

It doesn't find that.

Justice Scalia, I disagree.

He reached the conclusion

No.

If they knew the information,

Justice Scalia is asking you a question.

11

MR. VERRILLI:

12

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

He reached the conclusion because he

13

said, I have no reason to believe that they had the

14

information.

15

have it.

16

He never made the finding that they didn't

MR. VERRILLI:

I think that's implicit, Justice

17

Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to

18

investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the

19

proffer which didn't include any of this information and

20

for which there would have been absolutely no explanation

21

for its exclusion.

22

think with respect to the -- to the factual finding that

23

the Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social

24

services records documented abuse and provided the source

25

of his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.

Absolutely none whatsoever.

So I

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no

2

reason why it wouldn't come in if they had it.

3

couldn't counsel for the defense think if we introduce

4

this, it's going to be subject to cross examination?

5

if we look at that social history, we find out that the

6

whole thing is -- the defendant himself was the source of

7

the information about the horrible sexual abuse he had

8

been exposed to as a child.

9

person who had been so abused would be full of hate and

10

therefore very likely would have had the mental state to

11

carry out this brutal murder that -- in other words, that

12

this kind of information could be a two-edged sword.

13

jury could infer from it he's not fully responsible for

14

his acts or, on the other hand, that this person was

15

violent, full of hate, and indeed committed this brutal

16

murder.

17

MR. VERRILLI:

Why

And

The jury might find that a

The

Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm

18

going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I

19

need a minute to do it.

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

The question under Strickland, it

22

seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was

23

a failure to investigate adequately, the question is

24

whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome

25

would have been different as a result of that failure.

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

And in this case, it seems to me, that means that what

2

we -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an

3

objective test.

4

of the individual decision makers.

5

analysis.

That is not based on the idiosyncracies
It's an objective

And so the question here is whether had this

6
7

information been investigated, if it was in the hands of

8

competent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that

9

competent counsel would have used it and introduced it,

10

and then is there a reasonable probability that it would

11

have affected the sentencing jury's outcome.
And the second half of that analysis, it seems

12
13

to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.
The first half of that analysis seems to us

14
15

clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your

16

Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be

17

a justification for not submitting this evidence to the

18

jury.

19

one, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so

20

because this evidence has so little of what this Court has

21

described in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp

22

double edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we

23

don't think it would have that effect.

24
25

Yes, there might.

We think in a case like this

But we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the
relevant question.

Once you've established deficient

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

performance with respect to investigation, then we shift

2

to the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis.

3

And so long as there is a reasonable probability that

4

competent counsel would have used this information in

5

combination with the case that they made, then -- and

6

there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would

7

have been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor

8

establishes for us, then we have shown what we need to

9

show to be entitled to relief.

10

QUESTION:

Do you --

11

QUESTION:

What are the --

12

QUESTION:

What do you think the test is that

13

Williams against Taylor lays down as to determining a -- a

14

probability of a different outcome?
MR. VERRILLI:

15

Well, I think, if I may just draw

16

from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to

17

that.

18

State court to consider the totality of the record, that's

19

an unreasonable application with respect to prejudice.

20

And with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's

21

dissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more

22

severe case of aggravating information than here.

23

Williams had a terrible, long record of violence.

24

has none.

25

stronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the

If there's an obvious failure on the part of the

Wiggins

And the mitigating evidence here is even

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Williams case.
And so we think it follows directly from

3

Williams that -- that if you look at whether there's a

4

reasonable probability that the outcome would have been

5

different here on the basis of submitting this evidence,

6

that we think that's a very clear and easy case under the

7

standards that Williams sets.

8

QUESTION:

9

Are -- are you making any argument

that the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have

10

been different if there had been a proffer of this?

11

did the judge rule on the bifurcation motion without

12

knowing what the mitigation evidence might be?

13

MR. VERRILLI:

Or

The -- factually, Justice

14

Kennedy, it's the latter.

15

bifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial.

16

QUESTION:

The -- he ruled on the

Is -- is that a common motion in

17

Maryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing

18

proceeding?

19

MR. VERRILLI:

At the time it was, and the

20

reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime

21

shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County,

22

another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion.

23

And we think that fact reinforces the utterly

24

unreasonable character of the failure to investigate here.

25

These lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a

2

mitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on

3

that mitigation case was the psychologist's testing.

4

after all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.
QUESTION:

5
6

And

But they would -- they would be

fighting over the principalship too, would they not?
MR. VERRILLI:

7

Yes, but that -- the point of

8

bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they

9

prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second

10

phase.

11

would they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have

12

any of the tactical cross currents they were worried about

13

because principalship was already established and they

14

could go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case

15

possible.

16

And only if they didn't prevail on principalship

And the fact that they were -- that they were

17

endeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of

18

the sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that

19

they didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989,

20

was the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not

21

investigate at the level that Strickland requires.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. --

23

QUESTION:

What about the psychological reports,

24
25

Mr. Verrilli?

Those were available to defense counsel?

of mitigation?
MR. VERRILLI:

10

one, what it does contain; the other, what it

11

to do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and

12

then psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing.

13

evidence is undisputed about that.

14

psychologist did.

15

The

That's what the

The thing that's significant about what was

16

discovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline

17

intelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and

18

entirely consistent -- it would have been entirely

19

consistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence,

20

in addition to an effort to disprove principalship,

21

because the borderline intelligence would easily and

22

strongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins

23

was an accomplice and not a principal.

24

But the thing it doesn't show is any of the

25

history of abuse, and that's because the psychologist

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

wasn't commissioned to do that.

2

needed to do here, which was to do the social history.

3

The evidence is clear that it was routine practice in

4

these public defenders' office to do the social history.

5

They admitted that.

6

and the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were

7

available for that purpose.

8

just dropped the ball on this.

9

the lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't

10

do what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had

11

never seen not done, which is prepare this social history

12

and -QUESTION:

13

They didn't do what they

The evidence is clear -- and the --

They just didn't do it.

They

They didn't do what all

Mr. Verrilli, is -- is there any

14

evidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense

15

counsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell

16

us about your background and what has happened to you in

17

your life?

18

about that?

Is there any evidence one way or the other

MR. VERRILLI:

19

There is not.

There is not, but

20

it wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an

21

interview like that occurred, that the defendant would not

22

have revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this

23

kind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a

24

defendant.

25

It very often requires a professional to do

That is why -- that's the very reason why the social

Alderson Reporting Company

workers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories

as a -- as a routine matter.

And it wasn't done here.

If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve my remaining time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BAIR:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to first start with a correction in the

11
12

factual record in this case.

13

has -- has referred the Court to JA605 and 606.

14

indeed, that was a comment made by the post-conviction

15

court during the State post-conviction proceedings.

16

However, that was an oral comment from the bench in April

17

of 1994.

18

Counsel for petitioner
And

The post-conviction court's written opinion did

19

not issue until 1997.

And in the post-conviction written

20

opinion -- it was a 257-page written opinion.

21

written opinion basically countermanded and superseded and

22

disavowed the statements that are on page JA605 and 606.

If you look to page 137a of the appendix to the petition

24

for writ of certiorari, that is where you have the

MR. BAIR:

137a, Your Honor.

That is where

3

you have the excerpt from the State habeas, State

4

court's opinion or footnotes in the -- in the appendix?
MR. BAIR:

And if you look

This is in -- these are footnotes in

the State post-conviction court's opinion.

It was, as I

10

said, a very lengthy opinion and had several hundred

11

footnotes as well as 257 pages.
By the time the post-conviction court rendered

12
13

its final decision, its written decision, it had the

14

transcripts from the post-conviction proceeding.

15

and as you may recall, the post-conviction proceeding

16

lasted 5 months.

17

5-month post-conviction hearing.

That footnote 261 is the transcript that Justice

Scalia was referring to which is on JA490 and 491.

20

this is the testimony that the post-conviction court used

to make its fact finding.

Is -- is the way that counsel says it

21

should have been done the way that lawyers typically do it

in -- in Maryland?

MR. BAIR:

I think they do it in different ways,

24

Your Honor.

I think -- I think sometimes they use

25

forensic social workers.

Sometimes they use

psychologists.
QUESTION:

3

But they're wrong to tell us that

they normally use social workers.

Is that right?

4

MR. BAIR:

I think --

5

QUESTION:

That was -- his representation was

6

that this case is unique because every other member of the

7

defense bar routinely gets the social history.

8

is that right or wrong?
MR. BAIR:

9

I think it's wrong.

Are you --

I think it's

10

wrong, Your Honor.

I think that lawyers in Maryland use

11

psychiatrists, they use psychologists, they use social

12

workers, they use combinations thereof.

But he didn't use any of these.

14

MR. BAIR:

He didn't use any of those.

If -- the DSS records that he

obtained -- are they all in the lodging or there are some

MR. BAIR:

Yes.

They're all -- they're all in

Okay.

Now, if -- if -- it's

I can't find a

That's there, but none of this other

9

And -- and, indeed, if he looked at any of it --

10

anywhere for this other stuff, where would he have looked?

11

Why wasn't that in the record which took 5 months, if in

12

fact he looked?

13

than an ambiguous statement where he seems to refer to the

14

lodging?

15
16
17

Why was there no more reference to it

MR. BAIR:

Your Honor, a couple of -- a couple

of points to be made.
First of all, I -- I agree, and I think we state

18

in our brief, there is no specific reference to sexual

19

abuse in those -- in -- in the lodging.

20

QUESTION:

And that's actually -- to me that's

21

the most serious thing there is, I mean, in terms of

22

shaping an individual who could later turn out the way

23

that some have turned out.

24

horrible in this case, and -- and there's absolutely no

25

reference whatsoever that I can find that suggests that

And -- and there is -- it was

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this lawyer even knew about it.
MR. BAIR:

2
3

Well, there is, Your Honor.

That --

that goes back to JA490 and 491.

4

QUESTION:

He said he knew about it.

5

MR. BAIR:

But the lawyer explicitly testified

6

that he knew of it.

7

QUESTION:

And what was -- that's why I want to

8

know since -- since that statement, the two pages out of

9

5 months, when I read them -- people can characterize them

10

differently, but it seemed to me ambiguous, and the

11

written reports could have easily referred to what I call

12

the lodging.

13

what did they refer to?

But if they didn't refer to the lodging,

MR. BAIR:

14

The written reports and -- and I

15

think the reports of others could be either written

16

reports or oral reports.

21

In your opinion, what did they refer to if, in fact, they

22

did not refer to the lodging?

23

to the lodging, the lawyer in those two pages out of the

24

5 months simply made a mistake, repeating what he knew

25

later and thinking that he had learned it earlier from the

So I would like to know.

Yes, they could have

to be made.

4

of a record here, I think under Strickland that inures to

the detriment of petitioner.

competence, the strong presumption of reasonable conduct.

But let me go back to what the reports were.

8
9

One is if there is any ambiguity or any lack

You had reports from the client.

And I think, although,

10

as -- as was asked earlier by Justice Souter, there's

11

nothing in the record to say whether he spoke to his

12

client.

13

He represented him for close to a year.

14

petitioner at post-conviction never pursued those lines of

15

questioning.

16

talked to his client.

17

I think we can infer that he spoke to his client.

So I think we can assume that this lawyer

that -- that all that he knew was as it was reported in

MR. BAIR:

I agree.

9

QUESTION:

That is the only thing that he said

10

he got from other people's reports.

11

MR. BAIR:

I agree.

12

QUESTION:

We don't know where he got all of the

13
14

I think --

other information that he said he had.
MR. BAIR:

No, but I think logically, going back

15

to the reports of sexual abuse, there's only one person

16

that could have come from because even the Selvog report,

17

which is what post-conviction counsel prepared -- Selvog

18

testified at the post-conviction hearing that his sole

19

source for the information about Wiggins' sexual abuse was

20

from Wiggins himself.

21

Now, Wiggins obviously spoke to his attorney.

22

He spoke to the psychologist who interviewed him.

23

spoke to the criminologist that trial counsel hired.

24

Clearly, I think an inference can be drawn that Wiggins

25

reported that sexual abuse either directly to his attorney

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

quite important to me.

MR. BAIR:

I'm just trying to find out what

Either Wiggins' own statements or the

reports of the other experts in the case.

20

Other experts in the case.

21

MR. BAIR:

Right.

He would have gotten them from?

23

MR. BAIR:

From Wiggins.

24

QUESTION:

After the trial was over.

25

MR. BAIR:

No, no, Your Honor.

There was --

QUESTION:

Before, before.

2

MR. BAIR:

This was all going on --

3

QUESTION:

That's the criminologist and the --

4

MR. BAIR:

Yes, yes.

And those reports were

5

prepared before trial or between trial and sentencing.

6

There was a 2-and-a-half month postponement between the

7

time of this trial and the time of the sentencing.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

All right.

So the words, other

people's reports, could have meant Wiggins told me or an
expert whom I hired who talked to Wiggins told me.

11

MR. BAIR:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, okay.

13

MR. BAIR:

Or I guess the only -- the only

That -- that he was mentally

retarded.

It only goes to whether he was mentally

MR. BAIR:

Yes.

QUESTION:

I'm puzzled about another thing.

20

MR. BAIR:

The only other --

21

QUESTION:

Do those reports refer to sexual

MR. BAIR:

Pardon me, Your Honor?

Do those reports refer to sexual

25

abuse?

abuse?

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BAIR:

The only report that refers to sexual

2

abuse -- now, the only written report that refers to

3

sexual abuse is the Selvog report.

4

QUESTION:

The what?

5

MR. BAIR:

The -- the Selvog report was the one

6

done by the social worker during post-conviction by -- by

7

post-conviction counsel.
The psychologist's report was an oral report.

8
9
10

So we don't really know exactly what he knew because
there -- that was never reduced to writing.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I'm still puzzled.

Were there

12

any written reports available to the lawyer that referred

13

to sexual abuse that we know about?

14

MR. BAIR:

No.

15

QUESTION:

So then when he said you know that

16

there were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster

17

homes, he was wrong.
MR. BAIR:

18

No.

I think he -- he was referring

19

to -- he could have been referring to reports of Wiggins

20

himself.

21

QUESTION:

Oh, oh.

22

QUESTION:

Oral reports.

23

MR. BAIR:

Oral reports.

24

QUESTION:

That -- that word reports does not

I see what you're saying --

mean written reports.

MR. BAIR:

I don't think it has to refer to

written reports, Your Honor.
The only -- just to follow up with Justice

4

Breyer, the only other report was the pre-sentence

5

investigation.

6

available to counsel.

That was the other written report that was

7

QUESTION:

But that didn't have --

8

MR. BAIR:

No, no, no.

9

QUESTION:

I mean, what's worrying me obviously

10

is we're -- we're turning an awful lot here on this word,

11

other reports, which came in a fairly long hearing and

12

which would normally be taken as referring to written

13

reports, though it doesn't say that.

14

makes me concerned.

15

MR. BAIR:

And I'm -- that

I'm not sure where to go with it.
Well, I think two points, Your Honor.

16

One, counsel did testify and it was undisputed -- it was

17

never in any way negated through cross examination or any

18

other vehicle -- that he knew of sexual abuse.

19

he specifically answered the question, the more specific

20

sexual abuse question, I knew about the Job Corps

21

overture.

22

in the record unchallenged.

23

In fact,

So those answers are unequivocal and they stand

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's troubling because the

24

Job Corps overture is -- is quite mild compared to the

25

repeated days, months-on-end physical abuse suffered at

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the hands of the stepfather.

2

MR. BAIR:

I agree.

3

QUESTION:

And it seems to me that this -- well,

4

I'll ask you.

Does this permit us to make the inference

5

that if he had known this, he would have brought it out?

6

MR. BAIR:

I think --

7

QUESTION:

Because it's just very difficult to

8

see why he would not have.

9

MR. BAIR:

Well, I think he made a -- a

10

reasonable tactical decision.

11

QUESTION:

That goes to the tactical point.

12

MR. BAIR:

I think he made a reasonable tactical

13

decision.

He had a powerful case.

Under Maryland law,

14

the jury had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable

15

doubt that Wiggins was the principal, that is, the actual

16

killer in this case.
They also had to find unanimously and beyond a

17
18

reasonable doubt that the murder and the robbery occurred

19

at the same time, and there was evidence in this case.

20

This was a very unusual situation in that it wasn't even

21

clear whether the robbery occurred simultaneously with the

22

murder.

23

trial and at sentencing over when Ms. Lacs was killed

24

because her body was discovered on a Saturday.

25

was in possession of her car --

There was a -- there was a -- a huge dispute at

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Bair, may I ask?

Did counsel

2

during the -- the sentencing hearing come up with a theory

3

as to what happened other than that his client was the

4

killer?

5

MR. BAIR:

Yes, absolutely.

He challenged

6

and -- and very strenuously both during opening and -- and

7

closing -- pointed out the evidence in the case that

8

showed there were five fingerprints in Ms. Lacs' apartment

9

that were not tied to anyone.

10
11

There was a hat, some sort

of a baseball hat, that was in the apartment.
QUESTION:

No, I understand -- but did he -- did

12

he suggest who they might have belonged to?

13

up with a theory as to who --

14

MR. BAIR:

15
16
17
18

No.

Did he come

I don't -- I don't think there

was any particular person who was another suspect.
QUESTION:

He didn't suggest that the man who

lived downstairs might have been involved.
MR. BAIR:

No.

And that -- that was never

19

challenged as part of any ineffective assistance of

20

counsel in these proceedings, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Bair, what -- what do you respond

22

to opposing counsel's argument that it doesn't matter

23

because you didn't know until the eve of trial that you

24

wouldn't have had a bifurcated proceeding, so you should

25

have been doing this research in contemplation of a

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

bifurcated proceeding?
MR. BAIR:

2

Well, Your Honor, first of all, of

3

course, our position is they were doing it.

They had,

4

as -- as I said, lots of information.

5

They were -- they were keeping that option open.

They were doing it.

But another answer, Your Honor, is the evidence

6
7

would not have been put on.

The more evidence that --

8

that actually came out in -- in, you know, the

9

proceedings, the details that we've now learned of through

10

the Selvog report, they are so double-edged.

11

potentially harmful particularly in the context of this

12

case.

13

the DSS records, the -- the jury would have heard not just

14

that Kevin Wiggins was -- had been in foster care and had

15

a clean record, which is all they did hear.

16

if those records had come in, they would have heard that

17

he hated his biological mother, that he was in fights with

18

other foster children, that he had once stolen some

19

gasoline and tried to set fire to -- to a building, that

20

he had a disturbed personality --

Between the Selvog report and the lodged materials,

QUESTION:

21

They are so

In addition,

That all goes to explain why they

22

wouldn't have put it in, but why didn't they put any of

23

this in the proffer at the -- to the judge at the -MR. BAIR:

24
25

Honor.

There -- there was no need to, Your

There's no need under Maryland law to give a

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

detailed proffer.

They -- they did not want to tip off

2

the other side as to any potential things that might be

3

negative to their client.
And again, to the degree that we don't know

4
5

about the details, it -- it inures to the detriment of

6

Wiggins.

7

evidence and he didn't do it.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

It was his burden to bring out all of this

Does -- does the strength of the

mitigating evidence have anything to do with whether a
bifurcated proceeding is allowed?

11

MR. BAIR:

No.

12

QUESTION:

Would they have been more likely to

13

get the bifurcated proceeding if they had come up with a

14

lot of information about his childhood and so forth?
MR. BAIR:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

What does it turn on then?

18

MR. BAIR:

I think it was -- it was the trial

19

court's discretion.

20

back in 1989.

21

at the time.

22

has said absolutely not.

15
16

Of

course --

There wasn't a lot of definitive law on it
Since then, the Maryland Court of Appeals

QUESTION:

23

I think it was just a -- this was

Was there a transcript of that

24

hearing?

He just said, I want a bifurcated hearing and

25

sat down, or did he say, I want a bifurcated hearing

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

because there's going to be very substantial mitigating

2

evidence and I want the jury to consider that separately?

3

What did he -- do we have a transcript of what he said

4

here?

5

MR. BAIR:

I think we do have a transcript, Your

6

Honor, and my recollection is that there was a short

7

discussion of it, not -- not a detailed discussion of it.

8
9

QUESTION:

No, but if he had been in a position

to make a strong proffer, why wouldn't he have made it?

10

His case for a bifurcated hearing would have been stronger

11

if he had had a strong proffer.

12

MR. BAIR:

Wouldn't it have been?

It would have been stronger, Your

13

Honor, but I think in all likelihood if you look -- if you

14

look at the Maryland sentencing law, it contemplates it,

15

as I said, the court of appeals in Maryland has since held

16

definitively.

17

in the Wiggins case itself on direct appeal, they have

18

held that the Maryland sentencing procedure in capital

19

cases requires that the jury go through certain steps, and

20

those steps all have to be done at a unitary hearing.

21

Obviously, there's a bifurcated guilt/innocence and

22

sentencing.

In fact, in the direct appeal in this case,

23

QUESTION:

Well --

24

QUESTION:

Well, obviously, the -- the defense

25

counsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

upon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would

2

grant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense

3

counsel should not have investigated the mitigating

4

circumstances pending that ruling.

5

MR. BAIR:

I agree.

6

QUESTION:

And yet, we don't have a clear

7

understanding of what he knew.

8

defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they

9

would be hearing evidence about the defendant's

And in fact, did not

11

MR. BAIR:

They -- they did --

12

QUESTION:

-- at sentencing?

13

And then nothing

was put on.

14

MR. BAIR:

No, not -- not really, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

I mean, what -- what is the jury to

16

make of that?

It's so odd.

MR. BAIR:

17

I don't -- I don't think so, Justice

18

O'Connor.

I think -- I think what counsel did is if you

19

look at the essence of the -- the approach at sentencing,

20

clearly it was we're contesting principalship.

21

one comment about you're going to hear what a tough life

22

he had.

There was

23

Now, that was done I think for a couple reasons.

24

One is the counsel knew that petitioner could allocute and

25

probably would allocute personally to -- to the -- the

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

jury.
They also knew that there was going to be a

2
3

criminologist who was going to testify because the jury

4

knew there was only two choices for this man, either life

5

or death.

6

knew it was either life or life without parole or death.

7

And they were also putting on evidence by a criminologist

8

that would show that Wiggins would adjust well to a life

9

sentence.

10

That was -- and life without parole.

But they

So I think they -- they also knew that -- that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

15

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

16

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The position of the United States is that the

20

Sixth Amendment imposed no obligation to present evidence

21

of petitioner's background at sentencing.

22

obligation to conduct a more extensive investigation of

23

his background before sentencing.

follow from a straightforward application of Strickland

The decision to choose a principalship defense

and to reject a mitigation defense falls comfortably

within the wide range -QUESTION:

6

What's the bifurcated -- I've never

7

heard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing.

8

work?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

9

How does that

My understanding, Justice

10

Breyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the

11

principalship defense could be undermined by presenting

12

the mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it

13

separately.
QUESTION:

14

Right.

So what do you do?

You

15

present the principalship defense and then the jury votes

16

death or life, and then if they vote death, they go on and

17

present the next one, and if the next jury or the same

18

jury, having heard the other one, votes life, then it's

19

life?

20

I mean, I don't see how it works.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

My understanding is that under

21

the theory advanced by petitioner's counsel in support of

22

the bifurcation motion, principalship alone would be

23

determined at the first phase of the sentencing.

24

jury found principalship, there would be a second phase at

25

which counsel could --

If the

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

Under those circumstances,

2

they're saying that, obviously, in that motion he would

3

have given everything he knew about the background since

he thought it might work that way, and if he didn't,

5

that's evidence, in fact, amazingly convincing evidence,

6

that he didn't know.

7

history.

8
9
10

He didn't know about the sexual

And the main argument they're making has nothing
to do with the strategic choice.

It has to do with his

failure to investigate.

11

So what's your -- what's your response?

12

MR. HIMMELFARB:

If you look at the actual

13

proffer that was made in support of the bifurcation

14

motion, which is at pages 44 and 45 of the joint appendix,

15

what counsel said was, I can proffer to the court that in

16

a non-bifurcated proceeding, the defense is in a position

17

of coming forward with evidence regarding psychological

18

history on Mr. Wiggins.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

This is 40 -- page 44 of the appendix

to the petition?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

It's

22

the joint appendix.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HIMMELFARB:

25

I'm in a position to come forward with evidence

Oh, the joint appendix?
Page 44 at the bottom.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

regarding psychological history on Mr. Wiggins, including

2

aspects of his life history, including a diagnosis of a

3

personality disorder, including diagnosis of some

4

retardation.

So --

QUESTION:

5

So he says nothing whatsoever about

6

the most frightful sexual abuse, about having the mother

7

who did all the things that this one particularly did, not

8

feeding them, burning their hands on the stove, et cetera.

9

I won't list it.

But I just don't see anything in the

10

thing you've just read that suggests that he knew a single

11

thing about that.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

12

Well, it's true it was a

13

general proffer rather than a highly particularized

14

proffer.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

And so their point is,

16

obviously, if he had known about it, he would have said

17

something, and the fact that he didn't say something, when

18

coupled with the ambiguities on the pages, you know, 404

19

or 405 or 401-402 -- you get what we're talking about, the

20

footnote -- coupled with that shows that the correct

21

reading of that is he didn't know about it.

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think there's an important

23

point to keep in mind here.

The constitutional right

24

petitioner has raised in this case is not the duty to

25

know, it's the duty to investigate.

The claim is that the

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

investigation was constitutionally inadequate.
And the other important thing to keep in mind is

2
3

that there is significant evidence in the record that a

4

significant investigation was done, an investigation which

5

we think is constitutionally adequate.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Himmelfarb, in that connection,

7

there's something I'd like you to set me straight on.

8

There was a statement at some point that each of the

9

defense counsel thought the other was going to bear the

10

laboring awe in working up the mitigation case.

11

seems to me that each one thought the other was doing it

12

and the other wasn't doing it.

13

representation if each one thought the other was

14

investigating and it turned out neither investigated.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

15

Now, it

That would be ineffective

I agree that would be

16

problematic, but I don't think the record bears that

17

suggestion out, again, going to the joint appendix.
QUESTION:

18

Well, where -- where do I get that

19

notion from that each one thought the other was

20

principally responsible for working up the mitigation

21

case?

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Petitioner makes that argument

23

in his brief, and there are record cites to support it.

24

But we don't think the record cites do, in fact, support

25

the notion that each counsel thought the other was

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

responsible for investigating the mitigation case.

2

There were two lawyers, Schlaich and Nethercott.

3

At page 485 of the joint appendix, Schlaich testified that

4

after he left the Baltimore County Public Defenders Office

5

and went to another office, from that point forward his

6

co-counsel, Ms. Nethercott, did most of the mitigation

7

preparation with his guidance.
Then Ms. Nethercott testified at the

8
9

post-conviction hearing as well, and her testimony was

10

that she had no responsibility for retaining experts,

11

that that was Schlaich's responsibility.
So I think that's a far cry from testimony by

12
13

either that only the other one had responsibility for

14

preparing the mitigation case.

15

about his or her particular responsibilities.
QUESTION:

16

Each one was testifying

Yes, but where -- the page you refer

17

to, he says, when asked what he did in -- in mitigation,

18

he said, well, basically what we did in mitigation was

19

attempt to retry the factual case and try to convince the

20

jury on the principalship issue.

21

the kind of mitigation we're talking about.
MR. HIMMELFARB:

22

Well, that's right, Justice

23

Stevens.

24

amount of investigation was done.

25

That doesn't sound like

It remains the case, though, that a substantial

QUESTION:

That testimony --

But this part of the transcript

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

certainly doesn't support that proposition.

2

MR. HIMMELFARB:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well --

That's the part you called our

attention -MR. HIMMELFARB:

-- in fairness to Mr. Schlaich,

6

I think he was interpreting the question to mean what was

7

your defense at sentencing, not so much what was your

8

mitigation --

9

QUESTION:

That's right.

So this part does not

10

support the -- the proposition that he did any mitigating

11

research himself or with the other person.

12

about the principalship issue.

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

He's talking

I was just responding to

14

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether it was true that

15

each one testified that the other was responsible for the

16

investigation.

17

record bears out that suggestion in petitioner's brief.

18

My only point is that I don't think the

QUESTION:

But it also doesn't show that there

19

was substantial investigation, which is what you went on

20

to say, and I don't think it's supported.

21

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I do, Justice Kennedy.

The

22

investigation that was done in this case by trial counsel

23

was not materially different from the investigation that

24

was done by post-conviction counsel.

25

counsel, after all, who obtained the social services

It was trial

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

records that documented a history of neglect.

2

counsel directed public defender investigators to go out

3

and interview petitioner's family members, which they did.

4

Trial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical

5

interviews of petitioner which were done.

6

Trial

Really the only difference between what trial

7

counsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that

8

post-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called

9

mitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation

10
11

and pulled the information together in a report.
But we're talking here about whether there is a

12

constitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any

13

difference in the two investigations, which is really the

14

fact that the social worker was there in the one but not

15

the other, we think can't have constitutional

16

significance.

17

I do want to say a little bit about the duty to

18

present claim because most of the focus in the argument

19

has been on the question of the duty to investigate.

20

We think that the principal defense was

21

reasonable both because a finding of no principalship

22

would have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death

23

penalty and because the principalship case that the State

24

put on here was so weak.

25

We also think it was reasonable not to present a

1

mitigation defense either in addition to the principalship

2

defense or instead of it.

3

present it in addition to the principal defense because it

4

had a -- a very serious possibility of undermining it.

5

was reasonable not to present it instead of the

6

principalship defense because mitigating evidence is just

7

that.

8

aggravating circumstances.

9

a sentence of death.

It was reasonable not to

It

It's evidence that would be weighed against
It might or might not lead to

A finding of no principalship is a categorical

10
11

bar to imposition of the death penalty.

12

harbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had

13

carried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to

14

return a verdict of life.
QUESTION:

15

If a single juror

But presumably the -- the

16

determination of the facts about the murder was made in

17

the trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and

18

they found him guilty.

19

at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation,

20

do you think we can say that's reasonable?

And so to try to redetermine that

MR. HIMMELFARB:

21

Absolutely.

There were two

22

different issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue

23

at the sentencing, as far as the -- as far as petitioner's

24

role is concerned.

25

murder.

He was charged with first degree

As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

degree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of

2

principalship, a finding that petitioner himself had

3

carried out the killing.

4

understandable that petitioner's counsel would think that

5

contesting principalship at sentencing would be a

6

reasonable strategy.

So it was perfectly

Mr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

I'd like to clarify the -- the facts surrounding

13

the proffer because it's very important to understand how

14

this unfolded.

15

Counsel for Wiggins made a motion.

That motion

16

was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time,

17

the first day of the sentencing hearing.

18

was not made at that time.

19

friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich

20

he would proffer if he had to proffer.

21

proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it

22

can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to

23

51 of the joint appendix.

24

there of what he would have shown had he been able to put

25

on his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted

But the proffer

What -- what counsel for my

He made the actual

And there's a lengthy proffer

53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

to.

So -QUESTION:

2
3

He does that -- he does that to

argue --

4

MR. VERRILLI:

5

QUESTION:

6

He's making a record for --

-- after the fact that that the

judge -MR. VERRILLI:

7

He's making a record for appeal,

8

Justice Kennedy.

Here's the -- here's what we would have

9

suffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able

10

to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.
And so the sum total of his mitigation case is

11
12

right there on the pages.

13

it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy

14

suffered.

15

He's described what it is and

Nothing.
Now, with respect to the question of whose

16

responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on

17

the -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint

18

appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as

19

Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first

20

says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop

21

mitigation.

22

guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop

23

the mitigation case.

24

to do was retry the factual case.

25

what he says he gave as guidance with respect to

And then the question put to him is what

And he says, well, what we decided
That's the -- that's

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

developing the mitigation case.

So it's -- it's

2

completely clear that this was neglect.

3

the ball.

They just dropped

Now, with respect to what they actually did at

4
5

the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice

6

O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.
Remember, Strickland says no hindsight, but

7
8

that's an argument that works against the government in

9

this case because what these lawyers actually did was, in

10

opening statement, invite the jury specifically to

11

consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who

12

this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult

13

life.

14

And then they didn't deliver on that promise.
But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the

15

criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent

16

people do tend to adjust well in prison.

17

focusing on principalship.

18

the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry

19

and giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of

20

course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful

21

reasons to mitigate that the social history shows.

22

Well, that's not

That, once again, is inviting

And then third, there was as a matter of law in

23

Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury.

24

And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to

25

stop that.

And that pre-sentence report gave a highly

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background.

2

And the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to

3

leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins'

4

prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a

5

death sentence.

6

Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this

7

Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court

8

said even in the context of Federal habeas, the

9

deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference

10

between deference and abdication.

11

the other side are asking for here is the latter.

12

are asking for abdication.

13

uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the

14

Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and

15

convincing evidence, and even though that proffer

16

demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work

17

necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case

18

that could have been made to save this man's life.

They

They are asking this Court to

19

Thank you.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
