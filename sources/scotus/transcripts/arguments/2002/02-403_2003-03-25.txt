CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

Christine Beaumont.

6

Mr. Clement.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's campaign finance cases consistently

12

emphasize the fundamental distinction between

13

contributions and expenditures.

14

to a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of

15

corruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at

16

the same time, imposing less significant interference with

17

First Amendment values.

18

consistently recognizes that there is less rigorous

19

scrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to

20

limitations on expenditures.

21

Direct transfers of cash

And so this Court's jurisprudence

The court below lost sight of that fundamental

22

dichotomy.

It held that corporations of the type that

23

this Court exempted from the general limitations on

24

corporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life

25

were equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

corporate contributions to candidates.

2

ignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens

3

for Life itself, which specifically distinguished between

4

the expenditures and contributions of nonprofit

5

corporations.

6

That reasoning

More fundamentally, the decision below ignores

7

this Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee.

8

There this Court held that the broad limitations on

9

corporate contributions and the specific limitations on

10

solicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were

11

constitutional against a First Amendment challenge.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, the Government does --

13

does not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit

14

corporation from expenditure limitations?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice Scalia.

The

16

court below addressed both an expenditure issue and a

17

prohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the

18

Government only took up the prohibition on contributions.

19

So that is the only issue before the Court.

20

I think it's important, though, to understand

21

that that is a distinction that the court below placed

22

insufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction

23

between contributions and expenditures that underlies the

24

last quarter century of this Court's campaign finance

25

jurisprudence.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

And in National Right to Work Committee itself,

2

this Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on

3

contributions applied to all corporations, including those

4

like National Right to Work Committee itself that were

5

without great financial resources.

6

Nonetheless, in the particular context of

7

corporate contributions to candidates, this Court held

8

that it would not second guess Congress' decision that a

9

broad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption

10
11

was the evil feared.
QUESTION:

Do you think after the decision in

12

Massachusetts -- the Massachusetts case, the NRWC would

13

have a right to make independent expenditures?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think it would, Chief

15

Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to

16

first is your dissent in that case because in that case in

17

your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to

18

Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts

19

Citizens for Life.

20

that argument, didn't draw any particular distinction

21

between National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts

22

Citizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction

23

between the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations

24

on contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to

25

limitations on expenditures.

And the majority, in responding to

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

So I would read that decision as saying that the

2

critical distinction is not the differences among the

3

types of corporations with respect to contribution bans,

4

but is the fact that contribution bans are much more

5

readily approved under First Amendment analysis than

6

expenditure bans.

7

And National Right to Work Committee obviously

8

wasn't the last word on that subject.

9

reaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach

10

to corporate contributions both in National Conservative

11

Political Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens

12

for Life itself.

13

Citizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by

14

nonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First

15

Amendment interests.

16

This Court

Particularly, in light of Massachusetts

In the particular context of this type of

17

corporation, the corporation is free to engage in

18

unlimited spending on elections through the corporate

19

form, and the individual respondents are free to give

20

unlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life.

21

In addition and equally important, the individual members

22

of North Carolina Right to Life are free to give

23

contributions to the candidates of their choice up to the

24

constitutionally valid contribution limits.

25

Accordingly, this case doesn't involve the right

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to associate together or the right to associate with

2

candidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the

3

right to assemble together collectively to give money to

4

candidates of an organization's collective choosing.

5

even that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is

6

only affected to the extent that a corporation must direct

7

its contributions through a separate segregated fund with

8

enhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping

9

requirements.

10

QUESTION:

And

Why -- why is that an attenuated

11

First Amendment right?

12

the formation of political parties, people forming

13

together in order to collectively give money to particular

14

candidates?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Isn't that the right that enables

Well, certainly in -- in the first

16

point, parties are subject to a different type of

17

regulation under the campaign finance laws.

18

But secondly --

19

QUESTION:

Well, it may well be, but -- but I --

20

I wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of

21

individuals being able to band together to support

22

individual candidates.

23

our party system.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

That's the whole basis for our --

And -- and I don't want to suggest

that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

of -- of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to

2

suggest is that interest is less significant than the

3

interest in individuals banding together to make

4

expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to

5

make.

6

And I think even in the party context, this

7

Court recognized that distinction in the Colorado

8

Republican cases where it held that limitations on what

9

the -- the party can spend to support a candidate are not

10

subject to limitation, but what -- but there -- but there

11

are valid limitations on what the party can contribute to

12

a candidate of its choosing.

13

Now, in contrast to the rather minimal First

14

Amendment interests that are interfered with by section

15

441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the

16

integrity of the election process.

17

National Right to Work Committee already has recognized

18

that corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality

19

and appearance of corruption and that a broad,

20

prophylactic limitation on all corporations, including

21

those without great financial resources, is an appropriate

22

response to that threat.

23

This Court in -- in

All corporations, regardless of their size, also

24

pose risks of circumvention and of undermining the

25

workability of candidate disclosure requirements.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

As this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner

2

Promotions against King, the whole point of a corporation,

3

its basic purpose and fundamental reason for -- for

4

existing is to create legal separateness between the

5

individuals that form and run the corporation and the

6

artificial corporate entity itself.
Giving such an artificial entity the right to

7
8

contribute in its own name, independent of the individuals

9

that underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct

10

risk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on

11

individual contribution limits.

12

that risk by requiring that those contributions be made

13

through a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping

14

and disclosure requirements.

Section 441b addresses

Those bookkeeping and disclosure requirements,

15
16

in turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that

17

individual candidates have to file work in a meaningful

18

fashion.

19

revealed that the candidate received money from an

20

artificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what

21

this Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley

22

termed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true

23

identity and true source of the funds, then those campaign

24

finance forms -- or disclosure forms will not provide

25

meaningful information.

If those candidate disclosure forms simply

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

If, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying

2

corporations use a segregated fund that discloses the

3

individual sources of the contributions, then the

4

disclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion.

5

I think it bears emphasis, as this Court

6

recognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the

7

distinction between contributions and expenditures applies

8

with full force in the context of nonprofit organizations.

9

A limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's

10

members, who might otherwise not have the resources to

11

reach a certain audience, to pool their resources together

12

to reach that audience.

13

There is no comparable function or benefit from

14

the pooling of individual candidate contributions.

15

individual candidates themselves can perform that pooling

16

function by assembling together candidate contributions of

17

whatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage

18

in political speech.

19

The

The intermediate pooling function that the

20

nonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either

21

circumventing the individual contribution requirements or

22

assembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size

23

to potentially capture the attention of a candidate for

24

purposes of a quid pro quo.

25

provisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations

To be sure, the same

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to assemble funds in -- in aggregate amounts through a

2

segregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards

3

that are imposed, including enhanced disclosure

4

requirements.

5

Congress, in adopting section 441b, drew an

6

important distinction between corporations and their

7

ability to contribute and individuals.

8

context, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand

9

in stark contrast to the general right of individuals to

10
11

In the expenditure

engage in unlimited independent expenditures.
But no one has a right to engage in unlimited

12

corporate -- in unlimited contributions to candidates.

13

Congress addresses the threat of individual contributions

14

through dollar amounts.

15

of corporate contributions through the requirement of a

16

segregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure

17

requirements.

18

It addresses the distinct risks

Respondents effectively ask this Court to

19

disregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat

20

corporations differently from individuals for purposes of

21

candidate contributions.

22

essentially respondents ask this Court to treat North

23

Carolina Right --

24
25

QUESTION:

With respect, I think

Can you summarize briefly what the

enhanced disclosure requirements are?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Certainly, Chief Justice

2

Rehnquist.

The -- the main difference is that in the

3

context of a segregated fund, all -- both all incoming

4

contributions to the segregated fund and all disbursements

5

must be disclosed.

6

QUESTION:

You're talking about PACs.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

PACs.

Right?

I mean, the PACs generally

8

-- there are segregated funds in the particular context of

9

corporations and labor unions.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CLEMENT:

And the donor is listed.
The donor is listed.

There are

12

specific provisions for very small donations where the

13

name only goes to the FEC and is not publicly disclosed.

14

But there's a -- but really, everything that comes in and

15

comes out of the segregated fund is traceable either by

16

the FEC or through the public in disclosure requirements.

17

In the context of the corporation generally,

18

only -- only donations that are given over $200 and for

19

the express purpose of -- of political activity have to be

20

disclosed.

And that does create a significant loophole.

21

In the --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, is this -- is this

23

section 441b related or affected in any way by the McCain-

24

Feingold legislation?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice O'Connor, it really isn't,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

at least as this case comes to this Court.

The

2

prohibitions on corporate contributions have been in the

3

law since 1907 and have been left completely unaffected by

4

the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.
It is true that certain limitations on

5
6

electioneering activity, which is a new term introduced

7

into the law by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform

8

Act, do apply to corporations.

9

challenges to the McCain-Feingold legislation, this Court

So in considering

10

may have to consider the restrictions on corporations

11

engaged in expenditures and these new electioneering

12

activities, but not -QUESTION:

13
14

But at least the issue here in this

case is unaffected by that.
MR. CLEMENT:

15

The issue of corporate

16

contributions is miraculously unaffected by the many

17

reforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign

18

Reform Act.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

QUESTION:

22

of the PAC?

23

Senator?

24
25

In the end --

What is the -- what is the limitation

How much can they contribute, say, to a

MR. CLEMENT:

A -- a political action committee

or any segregated fund can give $5,000.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

This -- this -- you're saying that

2

this particular kind of organization can't contribute

3

directly, but it could set up a -- what you call a

4

segregated fund, which I was thinking of as a PAC.

5

if that segregated fund now wants to make a contribution

6

to Senator Smith for his reelection campaign, is there a

7

limit as to how much they can give?
MR. CLEMENT:

8
9

And so

I'd think so.

There is indeed, Justice Breyer.

It's $5,000.

10

QUESTION:

$5,000.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

And two points of emphasis just on

12

that question.

One is that respondents here don't just

13

have the right to set up a segregated fund, but they've

14

actually already done that.

15

segregated fund.

16

Massachusetts Citizens for Life emphasized that there are

17

unique restrictions and burdens on setting up a segregated

18

fund, and I think that's true in the context of

19

expenditures.

They've already set up a

And I know that this Court in

But I do think it's easy to exaggerate the

20
21

burdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund.

22

Although a segregated fund is like a PAC, there's no

23

requirement that they have separate offices or separate

24

officers.

25

and -- but it can be the same leadership as the

They have to have a distinct leadership and --

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

corporation itself.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4
5

I mean, could they have two members?
I don't know of any particular

limit on -- on the members.
But the point is all that's really required is

6

segregation of funds and keeping it separate.

It's not an

7

onerous requirement.

8

the four cases that this Court has had that involved a

9

nonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee,

10

Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan

11

Chamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those

12

nonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the

13

case got to this Court.

14

contribution context, that those are onerous requirements.

And I think it's no accident that in

So I don't think, at least in the

15

QUESTION:

Well --

16

QUESTION:

In Massachusetts Citizens for Life,

17
18

there was a separate PAC?
MR. CLEMENT:

There was.

This Court in footnote

19

8 suggested that that wasn't dispositive of its reasoning

20

because other -- other entities could set -- be in a

21

position that were similar to Massachusetts Citizens for

22

Life, might not be able to afford those burdens.

23

Massachusetts Citizens --

24
25

QUESTION:

But

But the Court did say for that type

of -- for that type of corporation, not a commercial

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

corporation, that was burdensome and unnecessary because

2

the risk of corruption for that kind of corporation was

3

significantly less than for commercial corporations.

4

that would apply here as well.

5

corruption, I'm buying the candidate by my dollars, then

6

that risk is less for an advocacy organization.

7

-- isn't --

8

MR. CLEMENT:

And

If the -- if the evil is

Is that

I don't want to suggest that the

9

-- that it may not be true that the risks are slightly

10

less in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation

11

than in the context of something like General Motors.

12

But I think in the particular context of

13

candidate contributions by corporations, this Court has

14

repeatedly decided that it's willing to accept a broad,

15

prophylactic approach and to limit all corporate

16

contributions, including contributions by corporations

17

without great financial resources.

18

in National Right to Work Committee.

19

again in National Conservative Political Action Committee,

20

but I think most tellingly, it said that in Massachusetts

21

Citizens for Life itself.

22

The Court said as much
It repeated that

And in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of

23

the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court

24

there specifically said that it understood that

25

Massachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

subjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime

2

for purposes of its contributions, and it was talking

3

about the fact that it didn't have -- that Massachusetts

4

Citizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders.

5

But it was quick to -- to reinforce that that didn't mean

6

that it didn't have members for purposes of National Right

7

to Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course

8

to the overall limit that it could not give direct

9

contributions to candidates.

10

QUESTION:

That was an assumption in the case.

11

You don't -- you don't -- you don't assert that it was a

12

holding of the case?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think it's

14

necessarily the holding of the case because, obviously,

15

that case involved expenditures.

16

this Court distinguishes a prior precedent of the Court,

17

that that's not a part of the opinion that a lower court

18

is free to ignore.

19

critical to the reasoning of the Court and should be given

20

stare decisis effect.

21

reason that's been brought to bear here to revisit this

22

Court's distinction in Massachusetts Citizens for Life

23

between contributions and expenditures, which after all,

24

is the fundamental building block of this Court's campaign

25

finance jurisprudence.

But I do think that when

I think that part of the opinion is

And I don't think there's any

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

You think whenever we distinguish a

2

prior case in one of our opinions, that -- that

3

distinguishing has stare decisis effect.
MR. CLEMENT:

4

I would think that in many

5

respects that's the most important part of the opinion.

6

It's not to say that the Court can't subsequently revisit

7

that part of the opinion.

8

this Court can do, but I think for purposes of a lower

9

court, anyway, if -- if this Court distinguishes two cases

I mean, that's certainly what

10

on the ground that the prior case involved a corporation

11

that had less than $10,000 and a subsequent case comes

12

along where there's $9,999 involved, I would think the

13

lower court would be well served to heed the distinction

14

that this Court drew.

15

context, obviously, this Court is free to reconsider its

16

prior precedents, but I don't think there's any reason to

17

do so.

18

And I think in this particular

The distinction between contributions and

19

expenditures has proved workable particularly in the

20

context of nonprofit corporations.

21

some abstract application of the contribution/expenditure

22

dichotomy that this Court has never considered.

23

Massachusetts Citizens for Life involved a nonprofit

24

corporation and this Court was at pains, pretty much at

25

every step in the Court's reasoning, to distinguish

As I say, this isn't

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

between contributions and expenditures.
In the end, I think respondents ask this Court

3

effectively to disregard Congress' decision to treat

4

corporate contributions distinctly from individual

5

contributions.

6

North Carolina Right to Life Incorporated as if it were

7

not incorporated, but there's no reason to disregard

8

either respondents' decision to incorporate or Congress'

9

decision to subject all corporations to the same regime,

10

segregated funds, distinct disclosure requirements, and

11

higher limits, in fact, on their contributions.

12
13

They effectively ask this Court to treat

If there are no further questions, I'll reserve
the rest of my time for rebuttal.

20

MR. BOPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Expressive associations play a vital role in our

21

democratic republic.

Because they attract financial

22

support due to their political ideas, not their prowess in

23

the economic marketplace, their participation in our

24

political process poses no threat of corruption, as long

25

as they do not serve as a conduit for business corporation

contributions.

I -- I don't understand that.

If --

3

if I bribe somebody, a Senator, out of -- out of political

4

motivation because I'm an environmentalist or whatever,

5

that's not corruption?

6

some economic motive that it's corruption?
MR. BOPP:

7

It's only -- it's only if I have

Well, that's classic quid pro quo

8

corruption which is dealt with by contribution limits,

9

now --

10

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I -- it may well be,

11

but I don't see that the distinction between whether it's

12

an economic actor or a political actor has anything to do

13

with whether there's corruption or not.

14

MR. BOPP:

Well, there has been some controversy

15

on this Court on -- on whether or not the -- the decisions

16

of this Court in Mass. Citizens and on Austin were in

17

accordance with the Constitution, but in both cases the

18

Court distinguished between the types of corruption that

19

are entailed by the corporate form, which is the potential

20

for unfair employment of wealth for political purposes.

21

This applies to economic corporations, that -- that is,

22

those that are not, as Mass. Citizens or North Carolina

23

Right to Life, formed to advance political ideas.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but you can have an immense

corporation formed to advance political ideas.

I -- I

don't -- this one happens to be a small one, but --

2

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

And --

3

QUESTION:

-- if you attract enough people, you

4

can have an immense organization.

What's the organization

5

for -- American Association of Retired Persons.

6

that's an immense organization with -- with a large amount

7

of available money.

8

MR. BOPP:

9

organization is not the issue.

I mean,

That's right and the size of the
The issue in this Court's

10

jurisprudence is whether -- is the nature of the

11

organization itself and not the corporate form per se.

12

the nature of --

13

QUESTION:

If

Well, Mr. Bopp, would you say that

14

the AARP, which was referred to by Justice Scalia, the

15

National Right to Work Committee, which was involved in

16

that opinion, and Massachusetts Citizens for Life are all

17

in the same boat?

18
19

MR. BOPP:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I

think we do --

20

QUESTION:

Why not?

21

MR. BOPP:

Well, the -- the Court in Mass.

22

Citizens established some criteria to determine whether or

23

not an organization, a corporation, benefitted from the

24

MCFL exemption.

25

are incentives to disassociate -- lack of incentives to

And those include whether or not there

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

disassociate by, for instance, having insurance plans and

2

other benefits of membership that are economically

3

related.
Secondly, you would look to the amount of

4
5

corporate -- business corporation contributions or

6

business activities.

7

not insignificant, in -- in comparison with the total sums

8

raised, then again they would not qualify.
QUESTION:

9

If those are too much or those are

Mr. Bopp, on that point I thought

10

that Massachusetts Citizens for Life went further.

11

said having a policy against accepting corporate

12

contributions, which is one difference between your

13

organization and Massachusetts Citizens for Life.

14

said they would take no money from corporations.

15

accept money from corporations.

16

business corporations, but you don't have a policy of

17

turning them away.
MR. BOPP:

18

It

They
You

You get very little from

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the

19

-- all the circuits that have considered this, which have

20

been four of the circuits, all agree that the features

21

explained and -- and characterizing Mass. Citizens in --

22

in the Supreme Court's decision were not constitutional

23

requirements, but descriptions of the organization before

24

it.

25

profit ideological corporations can still qualify for the

And all of them have agreed that -- that not-for-

22

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- for the Massachusetts Citizens exemption.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, would you call AARP an

ideological organization?
MR. BOPP:

4

I think they have a mixture of

5

political and nonpolitical purposes and are, therefore,

6

more like Austin -- the -- the Michigan Chamber of

7

Commerce and Austin that had a mixture of political and

8

nonpolitical purposes and therefore did not qualify for

9

the MCFL exemption.

10

And to complete my answer --

11

QUESTION:

12

I'll bet the members also get

benefits --

13

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

14

QUESTION:

-- and -- and that criterion would --

15

would make it different from -MR. BOPP:

16

There were also incentives that were

17

economic in nature that would cause people to be reluctant

18

to disassociate with Michigan Chamber of Commerce if it --

19

if it proved to be that they disagreed with their

20

political ideas or the advancement of their political

21

ideas.

22

And the four circuits that have considered the

23

question of the amount of business corporation

24

contributions have all said that as long as they are

25

insignificant, in comparison with the total revenue of the

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

organization, they still -- they do not serve as a conduit

2

for business corporation contributions and still qualify

3

for the exemption.

4

QUESTION:

But they could serve as a conduit for

5

a very large donor, a very wealthy person, who wants to

6

avoid the personal limitations on how much that individual

7

could give.

8
9

MR. BOPP:

Well, it is true that there are no

contribution limits to not-for-profit corporations.

10

However, the intent of a donor to circumvent those limits

11

would be -- contributing to a not-for-profit would be a

12

highly inefficient and ineffective way of doing so because

13

the political activities of not-for-profit corporations,

14

both because of the major purpose test that would cause an

15

organization to become a PAC if political activity became

16

their major purpose, and the Internal Revenue Service's

17

limitations on the activities of 501(c)(4) organizations,

18

which is what the regulations require you to be qualified

19

as in -- in order to quality for the MCFL exemption, all

20

-- all mean that a very small percentage of any

21

contribution to a not-for-profit corporation could ever be

22

used for political activity.

23

Furthermore, contributing to a not-for-profit

24

versus a PAC and a -- or a political party is also an

25

unfavorable prospect for a donor.

I mean, after all, the

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- a not-for-profit under the 441a contribution limits is

2

limited to a $2,000 contribution, where a PAC can give

3

$5,000 and political parties can give much more.

4

Furthermore, all of the money that PACs or

5

political parties receive in their hard money accounts can

6

be used for political activity, whereas I've mentioned for

7

not-for-profits it's really a very small percentage in

8

order to continue to qualify under the MCFL exemption and

9

continue to not be deemed a PAC for -- for the purposes of

10
11

the Federal Election Campaign Act.
Now, the disclosure interest that there -- that

12

there is for contributions can be readily and in a

13

narrowly tailored way dealt with by simply requiring that

14

any contribution to a not-for-profit that is to be used

15

for or is intended to be used for contributions to

16

candidates must be reported and is -- and is thereby

17

subject to the aggregate contribution limits.

18

much more narrowly tailored way to deal with disclosure

19

and the aggregate contribution limits than prohibiting the

20

organization completely from making any contribution.

21

QUESTION:

This is a

What you do then -- this is what I

22

understand you to be saying.

The -- one of their

23

justifications that has been advanced for this restriction

24

on contributions I've interpreted as the following.

25

have five people.

We

These five people each write a check to

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Candidate Smith for $2,000.

2

they should be able to give $4,000, which the law forbids.

3

So they form a committee, a nonprofit corporation, called

4

the $4,000 for Smith Corporation.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

They get annoyed.

They think

And now each of them writes another

7

check for $2,000, gives it to the corporation, and the

8

corporation gives it to Smith.

9

says, well, Congress wanted to stop that.

And I think the Government
It's not

10

actually going to limit them to zero.

They're going to be

11

limited to $5,000 as a group provided they jump through

12

certain hoops.

13

All right.

Now, what's --

14

MR. BOPP:

Well, if they're a PAC --

15

QUESTION:

-- what's wrong with that argument?

16

MR. BOPP:

Well, if they're -- if they're a PAC,

17

then they can give $5,000 out of the -- out of the $10,000

18

that you posit.

19

the most they can give --

If they're a not-for-profit corporation,

QUESTION:

20

I know, but do you see what I'm

21

saying?

I'm saying Congress doesn't want to have groups

22

called the $4,000 for Smith group even if they call

23

themselves something different.

24

MR. BOPP:

I agree.

25

QUESTION:

They want to limit each of those

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

members to $2,000.

2

MR. BOPP:

Agreed.

3

QUESTION:

And that's what they do, though for a

4

variety of other reasons, not directly relevant to my

5

question, they've allowed those people to get together,

6

jump through various hoops called the PAC hoops, and give

7

up to $5,000 extra.

8

say none.

So if Congress wanted to, they might

9

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, that's their --

11

that's basically the argument, and I want to get a

12

straight, you know, direct reply to it.

13

MR. BOPP:

Well, the -- the desire of subjecting

14

the aggregate contribution limit or a contribution in

15

excess of $2,000, one direct and one through another

16

source, is dealt with two ways and can be.

17

One is if the contribution made to this group

18

that you posit is earmarked, then that contribution is

19

considered to be a contribution not just to the group but

20

also to the candidate him or herself.

21

contribution is subject to the $2,000 limit, and the

22

contribution used for that would be in violation of the

23

act currently.

24

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

All right.

So that earmarked

So now -- is that --

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3

MR. BOPP:

That is current law.

And -- and so

that prospect is prohibited and appropriately so.
Secondly, as the Federal Election Campaign Act

4

previously required, that anyone contributing to a

5

organization, not a PAC, that contributes money for an

6

independent expenditure, that that contribution must be

7

reported by the group that does the independent

8

expenditure.

9

They could require money given more generally, not

10

earmarked, but more generally for candidates to be

11

reported by the -- the group and thereby subject to the

12

aggregate contribution limits.

13

QUESTION:

Congress could require the same thing here.

Mr. Bopp, isn't it also the case that

14

the -- that the corporation that Justice Breyer posits

15

would not qualify as -- as a 501 exempt organization if

16

the only thing it's using its money for is to make

17

contributions to political candidates?

18

MR. BOPP:

That would also be true.

19

QUESTION:

I'm just trying --

20

QUESTION:

It has to be -- it has to be a

21
22

They --

relatively insignificant part of its overall activity.
MR. BOPP:

Yes.

The Internal Revenue Service

23

would treat the organization that he described as a

24

political organization --

25

QUESTION:

So these five people would had to --

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have to get together with maybe 100,000 other people so

2

that their -- their little portion is so watered down that

3

it's not a significant part of the corporation's business.

4

MR. BOPP:

That's exactly --

5

QUESTION:

I didn't think there was a numerical

6

limit.

7

extraneous points I think you understood perfectly well

8

there.

9

And my question which tried to eliminate

I mean a 503(c) corporation but -- et cetera.
But I want to go back to your answer.

The --

10

the -- because I'm trying to get clear about this.

11

the -- what you're saying is that Congress could take my

12

group, with whatever else they have to do to qualify them

13

-- they could take my group and you're saying Congress

14

could just say, very well, we will limit the corporation

15

so that it can only give money from these five people

16

insofar as they haven't met their $2,000 individual limit.

17
18
19
20

MR. BOPP:

And

That would be an effect of what I

said, yes.
QUESTION:

And -- and moreover, it could require

reporting so we know who they are.

21

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, is that a less

23

restrictive alternative than what Congress has actually

24

done, which is to say, proceed through a segregated fund?

25

MR. BOPP:

Yes, much less restrictive.

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Because?

Because?

2

MR. BOPP:

Well, because this Court held in

3

Mass. Citizens and Austin that the PAC requirements, both

4

administrative, including record keeping, appointment of a

5

treasurer, filing regular reports, et cetera, and the

6

limits that are imposed upon PACs -- there's a $5,000

7

contribution limit to PACs, et cetera -- all impose an --

8

a constitutionally burden -- a burden on constitutionally

9

exercised rights that did not -- that did not pass

10

constitutional muster.

11

can do it under a PAC, that imposes an unconstitutional

12

burden on the First Amendment activities.

13

So -- so while it is true that you

And that, of course, all goes back to, you know,

14

is there a justification for this.

15

have a prohibited source --

16

QUESTION:

In other words, we

Well, just before you go on, I don't

17

see why your proposal doesn't have all of the same

18

administrative inconveniences.

19

MR. BOPP:

Well, there's a one-page report.

20

There are organizations that can do independent

21

expenditures that are not PACs.

22

page report to file, and that -- and that report would say

23

how much is being spent on the independent expenditure and

24

how much has been donated to the organization for the

25

purpose of that independent expenditure.

There's a one -- one-

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Similarly, a report like that could be filed for

2

contributions so that we could capture those people who

3

are trying to circumvent the limits to -- to make

4

undisclosed or excessive contributions.

5

them because then the only choice left to the donor would

6

be a completely undifferentiated, unearmarked contribution

7

that is going to be used by the organization 95, 98

8

percent for other purposes, for lobbying, for education,

9

for other charitable activity.

10

QUESTION:

We would capture

Mr. Bopp, the Court basically decided

11

this issue in National Right to Work Committee case,

12

didn't it?

13

nonprofit corporation.

14
15
16
17
18

You just want us to distinguish your type of

MR. BOPP:

Well, we are asking you to

distinguish the Massachusetts Citizens for Life type -QUESTION:

I think that's very hard to do.

I

mean, we dealt with this precise issue in that case.
MR. BOPP:

But there was no issue in that case

19

about whether or not the organization itself should not be

20

viewed as a prohibited source of -- of making independent

21

expenditures or making contributions in that case.

22
23

QUESTION:

But the organization opted for the

corporate form --

24

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

-- knowing about these limitations.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Yes, but this Court has -- was clear

2

in Mass. Citizens that it's not the corporate form per se,

3

but the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for

4

political purposes and held that these types of

5

organizations pose no threat, no threat whatsoever.

6

QUESTION:

Well, it couldn't have been a holding

7

in -- in the Massachusetts case because there you were

8

talking about independent expenditures rather than

9

contributions.

10

MR. BOPP:

Well, but -- but --

11

QUESTION:

Certainly the Massachusetts case

12
13

doesn't control the outcome here.
MR. BOPP:

Well, we -- we believe that it --

14

that the holding of the Court in Mass. Citizens -- that

15

this organization serves no potential for corruption of

16

the democratic process, was essential for the Court to

17

hold that no independent -- that independent expenditures

18

would be allowed because, after all --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Bopp, at least three times in the

20

text of the Court's opinion in Massachusetts Citizens for

21

Life, at least three times, it distinguishes direct

22

contributions to candidates from expenditures, and each

23

time it explains why it reached the result it did.

24

makes that distinction.

25

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

It

1

QUESTION:

And I think that -- that that's so

2

central to Massachusetts Citizens for Life.

3

we just had this opinion shorn of all but however,

4

remember that this is not a contribution to a candidate

5

and then citing back to the -- the earlier decision that

6

Justice O'Connor mentioned, the National Right to Work

7

Committee, to distinguish it from this case, but it just

8

seems so all over Massachusetts Citizens for Life that it

9

is drawing this bright line between contributions to

10
11

candidates and independent expenditures.
MR. BOPP:

But in -- but in Right to Work, it

12

wasn't a prohibition on contributions.

13

limit on the amount of contributions.

14

limits on amounts --

15

So if -- if

QUESTION:

It was a -- a
And we agree that

Yes, but I'm -- I'm talking about

16

Massachusetts Citizens for Life and the line that Justice

17

Brennan drew in the Massachusetts Citizens for Life

18

between contributions to candidates.

19

about the holding in this case, he said, remember, this is

20

not contributions to candidates.

21

MR. BOPP:

Every time he talks

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

22

That's what you said.

But the -- the case did not involve

23

-- neither Mass. Citizens nor Right to Work involved a

24

limit on the amount of contributions, that is, like a

25

$2,000 limit.

We have not challenged that.

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Bopp, do you challenge the

2

distinction for First Amendment purposes between

3

restricting contributions and restricting expenditures?

4

MR. BOPP:

Only as to a prohibition on them.

5

That is, this Court in Buckley and reaffirmed in Shrink

6

said that there were both speech and association aspects

7

of making a contribution.

8

speech is concerned, this is a general expression of

9

support that is found in the undifferentiated act of

10
11

contributing.
Well, here they are prohibited from

12

contributing.

13

give one cent.

14
15

That is, it's a -- as far as

They cannot -- these organizations cannot
Therefore, that's --

QUESTION:

So -- so you're -- you're saying

there is a distinction --

16

MR. BOPP:

Yes, as to a prohibition.

17

QUESTION:

-- for -- for valid First Amendment

18

purposes between the -- the contribution limit and the --

19

and the expenditure limit, but that distinction is not

20

strong enough to forbid an entire prohibition.

21

MR. BOPP:

That's correct because both the

22

speech aspects and association aspects of contributing

23

that are -- that remain after limits on the amounts are

24

imposed because the speech aspect is a general expression

25

of support and the association aspect is to serve to

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

affiliate a person with the candidate.

You have your name

2

now through the -- the method of the contribution

3

affiliated with the candidate.
When you have a zero contribution limit, then

4
5

there is no speech and no association that is allowed

6

through the act of contributing.

Therefore --

7

QUESTION:

But you can say -- you can --

8

QUESTION:

I don't think any of our cases have

9

sliced the onion quite that fine to get into these nuances

10

that there's a difference between prohibiting a

11

contribution and limiting it.

12

have been primarily that contributions may be quite

13

substantially regulated, independent expenditures cannot

14

be.
MR. BOPP:

15

I think our distinctions

Well, that is -- that is generally a

16

correct characterization of your jurisprudence, but you

17

have to examine why.

18

subject to a lower level of scrutiny?

19

is is that the speech and association aspects of giving a

20

smaller contribution remain, but if you can't give any

21

contribution, then both that speech and association

22

aspect --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Why is it that contributions are
And the -- the why

But when you say can't give any, you

are overlooking or saying the PAC doesn't count.
MR. BOPP:

Yes.

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

It isn't an absolute no contribution.

2

It is, if you do it, you have to do it through this arm

3

that you create, this segregated fund, this 501 -- of the

4

501(c)(4) organization.

5

have to do it in a rather cumbersome way.

You can -- you can do it but you

6

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

So it isn't you cannot make any

8
9

contributions.
MR. BOPP:

Well, not only is it cumbersome, but

10

it's constitutionally -- it's an unconstitutional burden

11

this Court has held in Mass. Citizens and in Austin to

12

require First Amendment political activity to be done

13

through a PAC.

14

So --

QUESTION:

Not First Amendment activity in -- in

15

the Massachusetts case itself, as I just said.

16

want to repeat that except that Justice Brennan did repeat

17

it at least three times.

18

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

I don't

And I'm aware of that, but I'm

19

just asking this Court to -- to consider not -- not to

20

apply what is dicta in Mass. Citizens since it did not

21

involve contributions -- to -- to just apply that, but to

22

consider the rationale.

23

And in North -- in -- in National Right to Work,

24

the Court was considering not a prohibition on soliciting

25

contributions from members to its PAC, it was considering

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a limit on what is considered to be a member.

2

again, that case involved contribution limits, not

3

prohibition.
QUESTION:

4

So once

Mr. Bopp, that -- that First

5

Amendment right that you talk about as the associational

6

interest, the -- the ability to give at least a dollar

7

will identify you with a -- with the candidate, is that

8

really a First Amendment interest that applies to the

9

association, or does it apply to the members of the

10

association?

And as Mr. Clement pointed out, the

11

individual members of the association remain free to give

12

a dollar, indeed up to $2,000, to the particular

13

candidate.
All you're really talking about here is -- is

14
15

not the ability of individuals to identify themselves with

16

a candidate, but the ability of individuals by pooling

17

their resources to help a candidate significantly.

18

seems to me that that's the only interest at -- at issue

19

here.
MR. BOPP:

20

It

Well, there's valid reasons unlike

21

the representation -- or the argument of the Government

22

for people to want to pool their resources in an

23

association.

24

people already contribute to PACs and the political party

25

--

That those valid reasons are, in fact, why

QUESTION:

But among those reasons is not in

order to identify myself with that candidate.

3

MR. BOPP:

Well, but the --

4

QUESTION:

To -- to do that, all you have to do

5
6

is reach in your pocket and give them a dollar.
MR. BOPP:

That is true, but many people choose

7

to pool their resources because they want the group, which

8

has a separate existence and has a political purpose,

9

unlike them as an individual -- you know, they are not as

10

identified with a particular point of view or political

11

idea like a group would be, like -- like NARAL would be.

12

So if -- so they choose then to pool their resources with

13

the group in order to make the much more powerful

14

statement about the political ideas that they are

15

attempting to support and they want candidates to be

16

associated with.

17

Now, in addition, the fact that the group can

18

aggregate these small contributions and then make a large

19

contribution to a particular candidate enhances the -- the

20

contribution that the individual would otherwise made --

21

be made because it is being done by the group and in an

22

aggregate.

23

want to associate.

So there are justifiable reasons why people

And then further, the association --

QUESTION:

Mr. Bopp, it seems to me that your

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

argument really would go just the same way to an amount

2

limitation as to a total prohibition.

3
4

No, because amount limitations do

Everybody can just contribute $10.

not --

5
6

MR. BOPP:

Wouldn't that -- would that be okay with you?

7

MR. BOPP:

You mean the -- the amount that --

8

QUESTION:

Say the amount limitation was very

9

low.

As I understand it, you're trying to draw a

10

categorical distinction between total prohibition and

11

amount limitation.

12

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

13

QUESTION:

And I don't know -- I don't see that

14
15

your argument really is directed to that.
MR. BOPP:

Well, it goes to the source of the --

16

of the rights, the First Amendment rights, that are

17

implicated by a -- by an amount limitation as opposed to a

18

prohibition.

19

QUESTION:

But it seems to me an amount

20

limitation that's very, very low would have the same vice

21

under your argument as a total prohibition.

22

MR. BOPP:

Well, potentially, but that would be

23

a case to be a decided at that point.

And -- now, this

24

Court has upheld the $5,000 limit, for instance, to

25

political action committees.

And -- but you would have to

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

consider -- if it got too low, I mean, there's certainly a

2

potential for contributions that are too low -- as

3

Justices Breyer and Ginsburg explained in Shrink, there is

4

certainly a potential if they're too low to be

5

unconstitutional.

6

But here we're not talking about and have not

7

challenged the -- the $2,000 limit.

8

just don't accept the proposition that because the

9

organization poses no threat of corruption to the

10

political process, that they should be completely

11

prohibited from making a contribution.

12

We accept that.

We

So -- so we view this then as a source

13

limitation, not as an amount limitation, and as a result,

14

the -- the contribution jurisprudence of this Court that

15

have accepted greater regulation of contributions is not

16

applicable.

17

If there are no other questions, thank you.

QUESTION:

19

Mr. Clement, you have 11 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Bopp.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22
23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Let me begin with the distinction that
respondents rely on between limits on contributions and

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

prohibitions on contributions.

2

to that distinction -- and I rather doubt there is for

3

some of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy

4

with -- with counsel for respondent.

5

valid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute

6

prohibition.

7

Even if there is something

Even if that were a

This Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for

8

Life and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters,

9

made clear that the limitations on corporate and labor

10

union contributions in section 441b are not a, quote,

11

absolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on

12

contributions.

13

to make the contributions is another way of making this a

14

limitation, a particular limitation designed for the

15

unique risks of artificial entities like corporations and

16

labor unions.

17

The availability of the segregated funds

And I think any effort to distinguish the

18

discussion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its

19

distinguished -- distinctions between contributions and

20

expenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be

21

different just doesn't work because both Massachusetts

22

Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee

23

involved this very provision, section 441b.

24

there might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on

25

somebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't

So whatever

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that or isn't that in -- in a constitutionally relevant

2

way after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens

3

for Life and National Right to Work Committee.

4

Some discussion was had about fine distinctions

5

that potentially could be drawn between the American

6

Association of Retired Persons, National Right to Work

7

Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North

8

Carolina Citizens Right to Life.

9

441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not

10
11

The point of section

found a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions.
MCFL itself, of course, drew some of those

12

distinctions in the contribution context -- in the

13

expenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction

14

between contributions in light of the inherently greater

15

risk of corruption from contributions.

16

Another suggestion was made that perhaps there

17

is a seemingly less restrictive alternative.

As with

18

independent expenditures made by nonprofit associations,

19

perhaps contributions that are made to the association

20

with the purpose of them being used for contributions to

21

candidates could be disclosed.

22

QUESTION:

Have we actually held, Mr. Clement,

23

that in regulating contributions, the Government must find

24

the least restrictive means?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

No, and to the contrary.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

This

1

Court has not held that.

It did not apply a least

2

restrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work

3

Committee.

4

plurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that

5

the least restrictive alternative was not required in the

6

context of contributions.

7

requirement.

In the California Medical Association case, a

So I don't think there is that

8

But I want to address the -- the supposed less

9

restrictive alternative precisely because I believe that

10

less restrictive alternative is illusory because the

11

suggestion is that -- that individuals could say -- could

12

disclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit

13

organization for the purpose of a contribution.

14

that's going to have the effect of avoiding the

15

circumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are

16

really going to volunteer the information that the

17

contribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose.

Well, if

18

And additionally, even if that is a permissible

19

way and would be enforceable in the real political world,

20

that really doesn't give you much of a different result

21

than what Congress has specifically provided for with the

22

segregated fund.

23

And indeed, the segregated fund actually is

24

responsive to the kind of First Amendment associational

25

interests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and even going back to NAACP against Button.

2

is that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations

3

could be a backhanded way to get at membership lists.

4

segregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership

5

lists and the organization itself separate from the

6

political activity of the organization.

7

Congress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a

8

requirement for all corporations, but simply made that

9

available, I would think that many nonprofit corporations

10

would avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid

11

the interference with associational interests as in cases

12

like NAACP against Button.

13

The concern

The

Indeed, if

The last point I'd like to talk about is simply

14

this idea that again underlies much of respondents'

15

arguments that because there is no threat from

16

expenditures to these types of corporations, there is

17

therefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging

18

in corporate contributions.

19

across the board, it would undermine the entirety of this

20

Court's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on

21

the fundamental recognition that contributions involve

22

greater risks than expenditures, and -- and expenditures,

23

therefore, are largely unregulated because they are --

24

presumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions.

25

If that analysis were applied

If there are no further questions, I'd like the
