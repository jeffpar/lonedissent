ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Court

12

hypothesized the very situation that we have before you

13

this morning because here we have a nationwide class

14

action settlement where the court specifically by judgment

15

retained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as

16

enforce it.

17

dismissal of this case.

18

to dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out

19

and as the district court pointed out, his efforts were

20

thwarted and the case was not dismissed.

21

A critical part of that settlement was the

QUESTION:

However, when class counsel went

Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed

22

the question presented from the time in your certiorari

23

petition to your opening brief.

24

presented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section

25

1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that.

And the question

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Does that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or

2

simply broadening the question?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

3

No, sir.

We -- we're saying

4

that under 1441 that because the district court retained

5

jurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to

6

remove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we

7

removed this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of

8

appeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth,

9

had said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the

10

All Writs Act.

And that is what we are claiming today, as

11

well as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have

12

set that out in our brief.
QUESTION:

13

But you have no right to remove under

14

1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the

15

Louisiana suit.

Isn't that right?

16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

17

QUESTION:

18

That is correct.

So you can't rely on 1441 and that's

conceded.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

We -- we can -- our reliance on

20

1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained

21

original jurisdiction and -QUESTION:

22

But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests

23

on that.

24

original jurisdiction, and you don't have that.

25

It has to be a case that would qualify for

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

construed that as being a venue rather than a -- a --

2

because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.

3

And certainly under 1651 --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ALSOBROOK:

What did you construe as being venue?
The -- the fact that we had to

6

take it to a Federal court in the district where the State

7

court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to

8

the -- to the Alabama court.
QUESTION:

9

Yes, you -- you can't remove a case

10

to a Federal court outside of the district in which the

11

State court sat, is my understanding.

12

MR. ALSOBROOK:

13

We took -- we took our road map from Agent

14

Orange Product Liability.

It was based on 1651.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

Alderson Reporting Company

2

to class members in the State court in Texas.

QUESTION:

And it was

And that was our

But that was all done under the All

7

Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted

8

by 1651.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

9

Yes, and we also, Your Honor --

10

in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as

11

well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.
QUESTION:

12

Well, what is your theory under the

13

All Writs Act?

14

comes under the All Writs Act?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

15
16

We contend that -- that in order

for the Court -QUESTION:

17
18

Is your theory that removal is itself --

Can't you answer the question yes or

no?

19

MR. ALSOBROOK:

20

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Yes.

I thought the All Writs Act required

21

the existence of some sort of a common law writ like

22

certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like

23

that.

removal.

25

There -- there never was a common law writ of

MR. ALSOBROOK:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

But the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent
Orange case -QUESTION:

3
4

Well, but can you cite any of our

cases that support you in this respect?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

5

Well, I can cite the New York

6

Telephone case where the Court said that -- that removal

7

was -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was

8

-- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and

9

that was -- that was certainly the situation here.
QUESTION:

10

But -- but that was a different --

11

that was an existing writ.

12

effect, that removal is -- is itself a writ.

13

don't see how the cases support you there.

14

MR. ALSOBROOK:

15

QUESTION:

16

I agree with that, Your Honor.

Do you agree that the All Writs Act

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, Your Honor, by

17
18

Here -- here you're saying, in

Why -- why then didn't you try to get

an injunction in the district court in Alabama?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

21

There were two reasons, Justice

22

O'Connor.

First is that an injunction would not dismiss

23

the case.

An injunction would enjoin the -- the State

24

court suit from going forward.

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And we would have had -- our

2

client would have had to carry this as a liability on

3

their books ad infinitum.

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't the injunction have

ordered the party to dismiss the case?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, they did -- they could,

Your Honor, and -QUESTION:

But then why -- why wouldn't that be

sufficient?

10

MR. ALSOBROOK:

11

QUESTION:

I suppose it would have been.

But if that's so, then why don't --

12

why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't

13

there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that

14

are there, when there was another way, totally consistent

15

with the words, the statute, everything else, that you

16

could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?

17

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Justice Breyer, at the

18

time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the

19

majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper

20

vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court

21

where -- that had issued the judgment.

22

number of class action settlements that are going on,

23

there must be some kind of way by which a Federal court

24

who issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across

25

State lines.

Today with the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

There is.

Isn't that just in your

2

answer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy?

3

provided the way.

4

MR. ALSOBROOK:

5

QUESTION:

You

Yes.

The -- the only loose end, it seems

6

to me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to

7

Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your

8

client would have in carrying liability on the books until

9

the second action was somehow finally terminated.

But

10

isn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either

11

the injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties

12

under the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone

13

into court in the second suit and said, they cannot

14

prosecute the suit?

15

please dismiss it.

16

dismissal and wouldn't that have taken the -- the

17

liability off the book?

It has been enjoined.

Wouldn't you have gotten your

18

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Therefore,

I don't know, Your Honor.

Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that

have been the appropriate course?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

I -- I presume that the State

22

court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we

23

don't know that as a matter of fact.

24
25

QUESTION:

I -- I was thinking about different

writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I suspect.

I thought the closest thing here was a writ of

2

certiorari.

This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ

3

of certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior

4

court.

5

State courts and Federal courts.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

6
7

That is correct, Your Honor.

And another reason -QUESTION:

8
9

And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat

And -- and -- which -- and so that

the absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me

10

that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely

11

on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that

12

we've been discussing.

13

MR. ALSOBROOK:

14

QUESTION:

15

That is correct, Your Honor.

Except that a lot of other lawyers

had -- had relied on the course that you relied on.

16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

17

QUESTION:

18

successful course in the past.

20

You were following what had been a

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

That's correct, and a lot of --

And not only that, a lot of

judges.

21

QUESTION:

Well, to be sure.

22

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And so there were a plethora of

23

district court cases that allowed the removal under the

24

All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had

25

jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit

2

cases.

3

QUESTION:

Were there any cases under the

4

relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that

5

used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish

6

the same thing?

7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Your Honor, no.

The Tenth

8

Circuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could

9

not be used in this -- in the method that we used it.

10

are not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our

11

situation there -- our situation in this case is much

12

different --

13

QUESTION:

We

But that was -- that was a question

14

of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the

15

antisuit injunction that we're discussing now.

16

it's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense.

17

raise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation

18

precludes this case.

19

Rivet said
You can

The other way to go is to ask the court that

20

entered the judgment, the class action judgment, the

21

nationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was

22

supposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the

23

-- in the original case when part of the bargain was to

24

dismiss it.

25

attempt that route.

So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALSOBROOK:

We didn't attempt that, Your

2

Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time

3

approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to

4

remove the case and to get it back before the district

5

court.
Additionally, we felt that it -- State courts

6
7

have cases removed all the time to Federal court.

8

thought it would be less onerous to the State court judge

9

to have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal

10

And we

court.
QUESTION:

11

I don't understand that because right

12

-- built right into the removal provision is a command

13

that the State court shall proceed no further.

14

removal petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against

15

the State court proceeding further.

16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

So the

Well, the removal petition --

17

actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time

18

because they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal

19

court.

20

that it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence

21

or some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that

22

it would be less onerous to the State court judge to have

23

it removed rather than have it enjoined.

24
25

And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

Looking at

the language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts established by act of Congress to issue writs

2

necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective

3

jurisdictions and so forth.
Now, in this case, you removed from the Federal

4
5

-- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect

6

the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.

7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

How do you square that with the

9

language, respective jurisdictions?

10

MR. ALSOBROOK:

11

had to rely on Agent Orange.
QUESTION:

12
13
14

Well, Your Honor, there again we

You don't rely on the statute,

though.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, we relied on the statute

15

because it says in the aid of their respective

16

jurisdiction, and --

17

QUESTION:

Don't you think that refers to the

18

court to which removal would take -- would occur?

19

here it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama

20

Federal court.

21

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And

Yes, sir, and we -- it was our

22

position that there -- there respective jurisdiction

23

related to the Alabama court.

24

QUESTION:

25

That is our position.

Even though you removed to the

Louisiana court.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALSOBROOK:

We had to, Your Honor.

That --

2

under 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it.

3

couldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the

4

Alabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go

5

to the Federal district court in the -- of the district

6

where the case lies.
QUESTION:

7

We

But 1441 wasn't available to you.

8

as long as something new is being created in -- under

9

1651, why not say that -- that the court that has

10

jurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to

11

stop inconsistent litigation?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

12

That could be done under the

13

Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor.

14

that.

15

There's no doubt about

And as -- as -QUESTION:

But do -- as far as -- you're

16

creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute.

17

-- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs

18

Act, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State

19

court to the Alabama court?

20

1441 is inapplicable?

21

So

MR. ALSOBROOK:

So not

Why touch base with 1441 when

Because 14 -- we didn't know of

22

any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from

23

Louisiana to Alabama.

24

allow us to remove it across State lines or even out of

25

the district.

Even the All Writs Act would not

Certainly if this case had been brought in

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Mobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the

2

court in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to

3

that district.

4

lines.

5

set out for us in Agent Orange.

But it was brought -- brought across State

And again, we followed the road map that had been

QUESTION:

6

But you still have problems even if

7

it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you

8

don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action.

9

Therefore, 1441 doesn't apply.

You would still have to

10

use your All Writs Act theory even if the case were

11

pending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same

12

State.

13

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Your Honor, we feel that

14

-- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen

15

that the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take

16

that case.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is

18

this writ called?

19

supposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department

20

to get him a writ of fixitatis.

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once

What -- what is this writ called?

A

writ of removal?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

This could be a -- well, there

is no writ for this, Judge -- Justice.

There isn't any

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

writ for this.
QUESTION:

2

Well -- well, then how can you do it

3

under the All Writs Act?

4

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Because in other cases, the All

5

Writs Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a

6

State court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.
QUESTION:

7

Certiorari I guess is the closest.

8

Historically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to

9

any other court and to any administrative agency.

10

that would be the closest historically.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

11
12

I guess

Would it?

Well, I think Justice Kennedy

brought that up and -QUESTION:

13

Yes.

As we've come to limit it, it's

14

-- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history,

15

it wasn't, I don't think.

16

saying, look, you were in a situation where you thought

17

that the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating

18

it, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the

19

precedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under

20

the lower court precedent, that this was the right thing

21

to do.

I mean, has it come down to

So you did it.

22

MR. ALSOBROOK:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Okay.

Now, if you turn out to be

24

wrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about

25

the stipulation?

They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And -- and suppose you were wrong about the route.

2

you any suggestion for us as to what to do?

3

guess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed

4

without prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and

5

-- and asking them to enjoin?

6

about what we should do --

7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Have

Do we -- I

Or what is your suggestion

Well --

-- if you're right on the merits of

this thing?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

10

If we're right on the merits,

11

Your Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the

12

Eleventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

13

I don't mean the merits of the

14

procedural issue.

Suppose that you're wrong about that,

15

hypothetically, but you're right about your basic

16

instinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we

17

promise to dismiss this case in the State court and then

18

they didn't.

19

of this.

They just didn't do it.

That was your view

Right?

20

MR. ALSOBROOK:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

All right.

So have you any

22

suggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that

23

ultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court

24

particularly.

25

way that you get that objective if you're right.

I mean the law.

The law should provide a

MR. ALSOBROOK:

I would -- the alternative I

2

would suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal

3

district court in Mobile with instructions for them to

4

file an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the

5

party -QUESTION:

But that would be up to you to -- I

it.

You'd

And I assume you would be free to do

If all this Court would decide, if it decided against

10

you, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this

11

purpose, that would leave you as though you had never

12

pursued that route and you could pursue another.

13

There's something curious about this case, and

14

maybe you can -- you can help me understand it.

15

plaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana

16

court and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss

17

that case, the defense counsel wasn't there.

Why not?
Your Honor, this is not in the

21

record but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the

22

class counsel days before, and he assured me that he would

23

take care of it and there would be no problem.

anticipate this happening because the language of the

25

stipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,

Alderson Reporting Company

court judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class

counsel.

and felt you didn't need to appear in the State court.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

He actually told us we didn't

have to appear, that he would take care of it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with

12

you and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we

13

would be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion,

14

we accordingly vacate the district court's order

dismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the

16

court to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.

17

We do not, however -- this is part of what it

18

said -- we do not, however, imply that the district court

19

may not by injunction force Henson's dismissal.

know, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision

here was without prejudice.

Well --

Right?

Yes, sir.

And --

Even if you lose here, you can then

seek the injunction.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

And also because the majority of

the circuits have approved the procedures that we followed

in this case.

QUESTION:

You have the Second Circuit; you have the
And --

Well, what was the reasoning of those

circuits?
MR. ALSOBROOK:

The reasoning of those circuits

19

were that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their

20

judgments.

21

NAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court.

22

NAACP II, the court said that because they had retained

23

jurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under

24

the All Writs Act.

For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,

Justice.
QUESTION:

Were those cases in which there were

two -- two different districts involved?

MR. ALSOBROOK:

The Agent Orange case, there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BEDERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The All Writs Act may not be relied upon to

11

remove an otherwise unremovable case.

province to define the limits of removal, and chief of

13

these is the requirement of original jurisdiction in

QUESTION:

It is Congress's

Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --

16

your friend to -- to explain why he was up here.

17

you up here?

18

you know, don't you think that an injunction will issue?

19

Why are

Because even if you win, the case will --

MR. BEDERMAN:

Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will

20

apply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an

21

injunction.

22

under this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State

23

court has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about

24

preclusive effect.

We are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive

Such an injunction could proceed because

merits of the injunction motion whether they would have a

2

substantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we

3

would certainly agree that they have the ability to file

4

an injunction immediately.
QUESTION:

5

Why -- why -- okay.

at issue on the merits?

MR. BEDERMAN:

What -- what is

The issue on the merits would be

presumably the proper construction of the settlement

10

QUESTION:

Of the settlement agreement?

11

MR. BEDERMAN:

That's right.

And, of course,

12

whether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties,

13

would, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be

14

properly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of

15

the case.

1

MR. BEDERMAN:

2

QUESTION:

3

That's right, Justice Breyer.

So I'm just curious what the defense

would be.
MR. BEDERMAN:

4

The only defense that -- that I

5

could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you

6

were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the

7

concern about whether including any and all claims,

8

including without any limitation any claims defined

9

herein.

And what has not been made clear is that there

10

were subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made

11

clear that certain classes of claims were excluded.
QUESTION:

Well, I guess that isn't before us

14

QUESTION:

It's not before us.

15

QUESTION:

-- is it?

16

MR. BEDERMAN:

12
13

here --

Certainly not, Justice O'Connor.

17

What's before this Court is what is the proper procedural

18

mechanism to be used here.
QUESTION:

19
20

And several circuits have allowed the

All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think?
MR. BEDERMAN:

21

In this fashion?

Yes, Justice

22

O'Connor.

That clearly this is what I would characterize

23

as a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the

24

Second Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases;

25

that it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

characterizes, a momentum of its own in the court of

2

appeals.

3

QUESTION:

In the Yonkers case, the United

4

States Government urged the court to take that position,

5

didn't it?

6

court dreamed up on its own when it was the Department of

7

Justice urging it.

8
9

So it wasn't something newfangled that the

MR. BEDERMAN:

That is true, but my recollection

of -- of the procedural background with the Yonkers case

10

was that there was some concern about how Judge Sand

11

drafted the consent decree in that case.

12

later acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by

13

certain representations made by the Archdiocese of New

14

York and therefore he did not include a provision that

15

would allow for a subsequent injunction or -- or a

16

retention of jurisdiction.

17

that circumstance to invoke All Writs Act.

18

He -- as was

That may have led the court in

But there, again, the complete alternative was

19

an injunction that could have issued in these New York

20

land use proceedings that were pending in State court.

21

even in Yonkers, which presents, I think, analytically a

22

very different context here, not a preclusion case, not a

23

case that turns on the construction of an earlier Federal

24

court judgment or settlement, there was the availability

25

of injunctive relief.

In that case, the Second Circuit

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

So

1

bypassed that -- that reasoning and went straight towards

2

an All Writs Act basis --

3

QUESTION:

But you said you would defend against

4

injunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was

5

narrower than --

6

MR. BEDERMAN:

We would defend essentially on

7

the merits, is that an injunction should not issue because

8

our construction of -- of the settlement is --

9

QUESTION:

Well, why didn't you seek that

10

construction from the court that issued -- that -- that

11

entered the settlement?

12

Louisiana doesn't know anything about this case -- instead

13

of saying, Alabama Federal District Judge, please clarify

14

the scope of the settlement so that we can either go on

15

with our case or know that we can't?

16

MR. BEDERMAN:

Why go to another Federal court?

We believe that the proper course

17

is -- in view of the precise enumeration of the -- of the

18

case in State court, that the proper course was to amend

19

the petition and seek a resolution.

20

Mr. Henson and his counsel could have very well

21

initiated an entirely new case and evaded the terms of --

22

of the settlement in that fashion.

23

decided that the proper course, the more forthright course

24

was to seek leave to amend the petition to make clear that

25

certain claims were dropped by virtue of the earlier

They agreed and

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

settlement, but there were remaining claims in play.

And

2

it was believed that this was the most forthright approach

3

to -- to use here.

4

I would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may

5

have been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal

6

court, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of

7

decision in that fashion.

8

was certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel

9

below.

10

But I believe that this course

I -- I hardly think it may be necessary to

11

indicate that the All Writs Act does not confer

12

jurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in

13

certainly the questioning and certainly in view of

14

petitioners' discussion.

15

been required and has been upheld in countless cases.

16

moreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal

17

courts issue writs, quote, "in aid of their respective

18

jurisdiction."

19

Original jurisdiction has always
And

Petitioners' argument essentially would read out

20

"respective" from that provision in the All Writs Act in

21

section 1651.

22

independently grant original jurisdiction, and this has

23

been consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 200

24

years from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as

25

Clinton v. Goldsmith in 1999.

Clearly the All Writs Act does not

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Moreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs

2

Act is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement

3

that such be necessary or appropriate.

4

indicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is

5

essentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the

6

All Writs Act.

7

3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs

8

Act can't be used as a form of cure-all to -- to fix what

9

would otherwise be the availability of other statutory

10
11

And as this Court

And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as

mechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.
QUESTION:

What would be wrong with the Eleventh

12

Circuit saying in substance it's the same thing?

13

we're trying to do is to stop this litigation from going

14

forward in Louisiana.

15

the wrong device, we'll treat it as though it had been in

16

application for an antisuit injunction?.

17

What

So even though the defendants used

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, if -- if, of course, the

18

Eleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in

19

that way and -- and had indicated that injunction was the

20

proper mode and essentially substituted, as they -- as

21

they seem to invite in their closing lines of their

22

decision, I think that would be appropriate.

23

certainly a difference in form and in content between a

24

removal and a narrowly tailored injunction, and I think

25

the Eleventh Circuit was correct.

But there is

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And other courts of appeals that have so held

2

have indicated that there are profound federalism concerns

3

that are implicated in allowing essentially a common law

4

writ of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's

5

role in dictating the mechanism for removal and -- and

6

patrolling the boundary and the balance of authority

7

between State courts and Federal courts in this country.
There is, as -- as the Court indicated, no such

8
9

thing as a -- as a common law writ of removal.

There was

10

no analogy in English common law at the time of the

11

founding.

12

indicated, would have been -- could have been potentially

13

directed, I would agree, to -- to courts.

14

circumstance was there analogy in English common law for

15

the court of one sovereign to remove cases from -- from

16

another sovereign.

17

obscurantist legal history, I think that would be clear.

18

But there was, in fact, no analogy for that.

19

truth, there's no such thing as a writ of removal --

The -- a writ of certiorari, as Justice Breyer

But in no

And unless we delve into a kind of

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BEDERMAN:

And in

Administrative agencies.
I presume that in English common

22

law, to the extent that administrative agencies existed,

23

the ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate.

24

It's potential that you --

MR. BEDERMAN:
commissions in London.

That's right.

Or -- or sanitary

One might imagine that.

But again, at issue here is -- is removal, which

3
4

this Court has always indicated is a creature of statute

5

because of the profound federalism concerns.

6

And essentially what -- what petitioners would

7

have this Court do is allow, by use of the All Writs Act

8

or analogous theories of ancillary enforcement

9

jurisdiction, to achieve what is otherwise unavailable by

10

statute.

11

Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All

12

Writs Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary

13

remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them

14

to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory

15

procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.

16

And as this Court clearly said in the

If I can say just a word or two about ancillary

17

enforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which

18

petitioners appear to be relying on it.

19

said very clearly in both Kikkonen, where the Court

20

indicated that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction may be

21

used in view of what courts require to perform their

22

functions, and in Peacock, where the Court made very clear

23

that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is a creature of

24

necessity, there can be no showing of necessity here by

25

virtue of the availability of alternate mechanisms,

This Court has

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether in the form of an injunction properly issued

2

against the parties and consistent with the relitigation

3

exception under the Anti-Injunction Act, or even,

4

preferably, recourse to State courts to properly rule on

5

the preclusive effect of earlier Federal court judgments

6

and settlements, as this Court made clear.

7

QUESTION:

What about contempt?

I suppose you

8

could have been -- your client could have been held in

9

contempt in that court, couldn't it?

10

you're wrong -- that he's right --

11

MR. BEDERMAN:

I mean, assuming

In the -- in the Federal court.

12

And of course, obviously sanctions were imposed below by

13

the Federal district court, and that's, of course, not --

14

no longer at issue before this Court, but that court has

15

that power.

16

So certainly there are a variety of mechanisms

to ensure compliance with -- with court orders.

QUESTION:

A number of courts that have allowed

the 1651 All Writs removal have said that they thought

that that was less offensive.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

injunction was more offensive to the State than this

2

removal device.
MR. BEDERMAN:

3

I would respectfully disagree

4

with that characterization.

The assumption seems to be

5

that the injunction would somehow issue to the State

6

court, and as of course we all know, that would never be

7

the case.

8

injunction would issue to the parties, however, with

9

instructions to -- to dismiss or an even maybe even more

That truly would be offensive.

10

narrowly tailored instrument.

11

QUESTION:

The -- the

Well, it may be that a particular

12

remedy in a particular situation might be less offensive

13

to federalism, but that's a concern that should be

14

addressed by Congress, isn't it --

15

MR. BEDERMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BEDERMAN:

Absolutely.

-- in view of this statute?
Absolutely.

It is -- if Congress

18

wishes to address the availability of removal in this

19

class action context -- and there is pending legislation

20

today to that effect -- Congress is free to do so.

21
22

QUESTION:

And -- and if Congress wants to be

more offensive, it presumably can.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. BEDERMAN:

25

I wouldn't speak to the

propensity of Congress in those circumstances, but they

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

could also amend the Anti-Injunction Act to also change

the balance of power between State courts and Federal

courts.

We take no issue with that.

questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Excuse me.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think Justice Breyer was correct when he

13

pointed out that the stipulation that was entered into is

14

really not ambiguous.

15
16

QUESTION:

The Eleventh --

That's not -- I don't think that's

before us, Mr. Alsobrook.

17

MR. ALSOBROOK:

18

QUESTION:

All right.

I mean, I don't think whether or not

19

you might be entitled to an injunction, should you seek

20

one, is -- is presented by the -- your question.

21

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, sir.

22

Well, Your Honor, I would say that at the time

23

that we removed this also we relied on NAACP II, and there

24

the Court said that if there are two alternatives that --

25

and they also pointed out a footnote 3 in the Kikkonen

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case which said that an injunction could be issued where

2

there are two alternatives that -- that you can choose

3

between one or the other, and that the -- the

4

Anti-Injunction Act does not preclude the remedy under the

5

All Writs Act.

6

So we realize that the Court is not a

7

legislative body and that it has been brought out here

8

that Congress is the one that can -- can dictate the

9

jurisdictional bounds of Federal courts.

But by the same

10

token, Your Honor, we have a great number of class action

11

settlements that are pending in this country that have

12

been already consummated in this country, and we face a

13

situation where the settling party who has settled a

14

national class action must have some kind of remedy to

15

stop suits in State courts that attempt to thwart that

16

class action settlement.
