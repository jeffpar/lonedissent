ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO NAJERA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. NAJERA:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner comes before the Court asking one

12

thing and one thing only, that the State of California be

13

bound by its decrees and its laws that have guided it

14

throughout the history of California, that the State and

15

the Federal Government be bound by the laws of the land

16

that have been in place essentially since the State's

17

foundation.

18

Since early on in this country's history, Chief

19

Justice Marshall looked at a matter similar and said it

20

would be repugnant to the genius of our laws to allow the

21

prosecution to continue after the statute of limitations

22

had expired.

23

Such has been the law that only a few times in

24

the history of this Nation has any State had the

25

trepidation to attempt to revive an expired cause of

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

action in a criminal matter.

2

States have been -- the State has not been permitted to do

3

so.

4

Moore v. State, and other such cases --

5

In each such instance, the

In each such instance, such as in State v. Sneed,

QUESTION:

Were those State law cases and State

6

constitutional cases?

7

MR. NAJERA:

They were, Your Honor.

And --

8

however, as I said, in Adams v. Wood, it involved a

9

Federal matter and it involved a matter that we might

10

consider equally repugnant.

11

prosecution of an individual who was involved in the slave

12

trade and laws that prohibited that.

13

to punish that occurred after the statute had run, and Mr.

14

Chief Justice Marshall indicated in that particular case

15

that even if the case had been treason, it could not be

16

prosecuted, for under the Federal law, treason was only

17

prosecutable for a 3-year period.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

It had to do with the

However, the attempt

Did he base his decision, the one

that you're referring to, on the Ex Post Facto Clause?
MR. NAJERA:

No, Your Honor.

He based it on the

21

law that the statute of limitations in that case, the

22

Federal law had in fact called for an expiration of the

23

cause of action, and the Court there decided that, no, it

24

could not be prosecuted.

25

the ex post facto basis, Your Honor.

But no, he did not decide it on

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

As the Court knows, we raise two issues here,

2

the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, and I

3

would like to point out that the two clauses, while they

4

both deal with arbitrariness and unfairness, are not

5

coextensive and that similarly, in addressing the matter,

6

neither is petitioner's claim as to each, for under the Ex

7

Post Facto Clause, we are not looking at to whether or not

8

rights have vested.

9

for ex post facto concerns.

Such is not a concern of the Court

However, in this particular case, Mr. Stogner

10
11

has been vested with a right.

12

given him a substantive right, a defense that is neither

13

waivable nor forfeitable.
QUESTION:

14

The State of California has

We've said in Graham against Connor

15

that if a provision of the Constitution speaks directly to

16

a subject matter, such as I think the Ex Post Facto Clause

17

does to your case here, then we don't go to substantive

18

due process.

We analyze it just under that provision.

MR. NAJERA:

19

That is correct, Your Honor.

20

However, as I indicated, the two claims are -- are not

21

necessarily coextensive, and I would like to point the

22

Court out to the case of Sacramento v. Lewis.

23

Court may recall, involved a high-speed chase.

24

were after individuals on a motorcycle.

25

crashed.

There, the
The police

The motorcycle

There was in that case no Fourth Amendment claim

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

because no seizure had occurred of the person prior to the

2

crash taking place.

3

analyze that case under the substantive due process

4

principles because it fell outside of the Fourth

5

Amendment.

The Court, nevertheless, was able to

Here we clearly believe that the case falls well

6
7

within the -- the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8

the Court decide otherwise, it strikes me that it should

9

not render this Court impotent to examine the matter as a

10

substantive due process.
QUESTION:

11

However, should

It seems --

That -- that would render the rule

12

quite pointless.

13

under -- under a very specific provision of the

14

Constitution and is not valid under that one, you then

15

don't move on to analyze it under another one.

16

you're saying unless you win under the narrow one, it's

17

not over.

18

go on to the Due Process Clause.

19

MR. NAJERA:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

I mean, the rule is if it is analyzable

And -- but

If you lose under the narrow one, you then can

Well --

That doesn't make it much of a --

much of a safeguard, it seems to me.
MR. NAJERA:

Well, Justice Scalia, as I've

23

indicated, the causes are not -- are not absolutely

24

coextensive.

25

State of California has guaranteed to the petitioner the

We have in this case a vested right.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

The

1

right that he be free from prosecution, the right that he

2

be free from conviction, and the right that he be free

3

from punishment.

4

As such, that can be analyzed, whether or not the Court

5

deems it sufficient, under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

6

the Court said in Weaver, we are not concerned under the

7

Ex Post Facto Clause with vested rights.

8

necessary for analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

9

is an additional factor that the Court certainly should

10
11

This is vested to him under State law.

As

That's not
It

and, we urge, must consider under the Due Process Clause.
If I may continue, analyzing the matter first

12

under the Ex Post Facto Clause, I think the first question

13

perhaps that should be addressed is whether or not this is

14

a rule of evidence and whether or not it falls within

15

Calder four.

16

State of California has defined it.

17

evidence because it is required of any finder of fact,

18

whether it be a judge sitting pretrial examining the

19

matter as a demurrer or in analyzing the matter as

20

sufficiency of evidence under Penal Code 995.

21

Clearly this is a rule of evidence as the

QUESTION:

It is a rule of

But it doesn't -- it doesn't go to

22

the kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive

23

offense certainly.

24
25

MR. NAJERA:
Your Honor.

Yes.

I -- I would beg to differ,

And the reason is, is California has injected

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute of limitations into every offense in which it

2

applies.

3

of the offense, and in such cases the prosecution is

4

barred if that material ingredient is not proven by the

5

prosecution.

6

jury must acquit if the prosecution is not able to

7

overcome its burden in that particular case.

In such cases it becomes a material ingredient

QUESTION:

8
9

And if the matter should proceed to trial, a

But that -- that simply says there is

another substantive element there.

It doesn't say what

10

rule of evidence you follow to decide how that was made

11

out.
MR. NAJERA:

12

It does, Your Honor, in this

13

respect.

14

example, and the evidence shows that the prosecution is

15

barred, that no public offense is stated, the jury must

16

acquit.

17

it would guide a court, in deciding what must be done with

18

the particular facts.

19

that the case is barred, then the prosecution cannot

continue.

21

22

applicable throughout, not just to California and not just

23

to the Federal Government --

If the evidence comes before a jury, for

It is a rule that guides the jurors, as much as

If the facts before the court show

The jurors must acquit.

QUESTION:

It -- it would seem to

legislature then extends it.

MR. NAJERA:

And it's during the extended
Is there an

5

reason I believe not is that what is promised by the

6

statute of limitations is not any particular number of

7

years.

Rather, what is promised -QUESTION:

8
9

And how does that fit in with the

description you just gave of -- about the evidence?
MR. NAJERA:

Because the evidence that must be

11

shown by the prosecution is that the case has not been

QUESTION:

But why isn't any evidence in -- in

one case or the other in the hypothetical I put?
MR. NAJERA:

not the case is barred.

2

The case has not yet run.
QUESTION:

3

The evidence is still the same.

Except it does if you're -- if you're

4

right on your theory.

5

MR. NAJERA:

I am right on my theory because the

-- the State is in fact barred from proceeding, and the

7

evidence that would come before the -QUESTION:

8
9

Let me ask you another question on

the ex post facto lawsuit.

Suppose the State has a

10

savings clause and it reserves to itself the right to

11

extend any statute of limitations.

12

the State then extends the statute?

13

MR. NAJERA:

14

QUESTION:

What result there if

I believe if there is --

And this was -- and then this in

15

effect at the time the crime was committed, this general

16

power in the State to extend.
MR. NAJERA:

17

I believe if the State has reserved

18

the right to extend a statute of limitations before the

19

statute has expired, then there is no ex post facto

20

problem.

I believe that the problem occurs -QUESTION:

21

Well, then you're not arguing for

22

very much here.

23

just pass this statute and -- and that's the end of this

24

case.

25

The -- the States -- all the States can

MR. NAJERA:

Well, it's not the end of this

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

particular case because the statute has, in fact, run.
Certainly a State is permitted to set statute of

2
3

limitations, decide the terms and conditions thereof, and

4

go forward in the future under such a premise.
QUESTION:

5

In this --

What -- what if a State says we

6

reserve the right to dispense with any of the elements of

7

-- of crime that are on our books?

8

that.

9

-- retroactively with any of the elements of the crimes

I mean, it announces

We reserve the right in the future to dispense with

10

that we have defined in our -- in our code.

11

say that's okay, would you?

12

MR. NAJERA:

13

QUESTION:

You wouldn't

No, I would not, Your Honor.

Why is this any different?

I -- I

14

don't know.

15

can't see how the State can get around it by announcing in

16

advance that it's going to -- to violate the Ex Post Facto

17

Clause.

18

If it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, I

How does that make it okay?
MR. NAJERA:

Because the Ex Post Facto Clause

19

violation only occurs when the offense is deemed no more,

20

and that only occurs when it runs.

21

run yet -- or the statute has not run yet, we are in a

22

completely different posture.

23

QUESTION:

24

it in advance.

25

hey, we told you.

So if the case hasn't

No -- in California --

But it has run.

The State announces

Then the statute runs, and the State says,
We told you beforehand that even after

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the statutes run, we're going to be able to get you.

2

I thought you said that's okay.

3

MR. NAJERA:

And

It's okay in the statute of

4

limitations context because there they have reserved that

5

situation that allows them to say the public offense still

6

continues in this particular situation.

7

is an absolute rule that says once run, not only can no

8

punishment be had, not only can no conviction be had, but

9

not even a prosecution can be maintained.

10

There is no

offense once the statute has run.
QUESTION:

11
12

What we have here

But you're saying a State could have

no statutes of limitations.
MR. NAJERA:

13

Yes, and -- and the States have

14

clearly done that in certain instances such as in the case

15

of murder.

16

such a particular case.

There is no statute of limitations in -- in

QUESTION:

17

And you have no trouble with

18

prospective application of either saying we're not going

19

to have any statute of limitations for this crime or

20

prospectively the time is going to be longer.

21

talking about the retrospective.

22

MR. NAJERA:

You're only

That is correct, Your Honor.

It is

23

in its retrospective aspect that we run into problems

24

because the State has clearly said there is no offense

25

anymore.

It is gone.

It is dead.

It has been

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

terminated.
QUESTION:

And for the -- the -- you were being

3

asked before about the difference between extending a

4

limitation that has not yet expired and reviving a dead

5

case, and for that there's -- there was a very nice

6

statement of the difference between the two by Judge

7

Learned Hand.

8

question, you would come back with that.

9

I thought in response to Justice Kennedy's

MR. NAJERA:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It is

10

clear as -- as His Honor Judge Learned Hand, that we're

11

not offended in the same manner before the crime has

12

expired when we extend the matter --

13
14

QUESTION:

That -- that was the footnote in the

Falter case?

15

MR. NAJERA:

16

QUESTION:

17

Now, that has never been approved by this Court.

18
19

That is correct, Your Honor.

Footnote 26 or something?

Have -- have various circuit courts approved of that?
MR. NAJERA:

Various circuit courts have -- as I

20

recall, have spoken of it.

Some have objected to such

21

language recently such as the -- the Brechtel case.

22

every State court that has looked at the matter, not just

23

in California, has said you cannot maintain such an action

24

once it has expired.

25

throughout.

That's clearly been the law

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

But

1

And it -- it is important to note that this type

2

of precedent, this history has been throughout the -- the

3

history of the United States.

4

early on, State v. Sneed, a case that was cited, I might

5

note, in the Kring opinion that was overruled by this

6

Court.

7

proposition that -- that a statute of limitations, once

8

run, did in fact cause ex post facto violations.

But nevertheless, it was cited there for the

QUESTION:

9

We have cases extending

Well, whatever the Federal stopper, I

10

-- I gather that this Court must have assumed there's such

11

a distinction when it was dealing with Fifth Amendment

12

claims and it said, once the statute of limitations has

13

expired, you can't plead the Fifth.
MR. NAJERA:

14

That's absolutely correct, Your

And State opinions are, of course, in accord.

And

15

Honor.

16

it is striking to note that as late as 1993 in a case in

17

California called Blackburn, an accused in a civil matter

18

attempted to rely on the Fifth Amendment in order to avoid

19

questions concerning child molestation.

20

there said, well, you haven't made a sufficient showing,

21

and the reason being?

22

essentially replaces the Fifth Amendment.

23

And the court

Because the statute of limitations

And I would note in that regard, in California

24

in particular, that the statute of limitations has been

25

viewed as such a powerful matter that it's been likened

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not only to the Fifth Amendment, but it has been likened

2

to the Fourth Amendment in that it prevents unlawful

3

seizures of a person.

4

Jeopardy Clause in that one cannot prosecute a person

5

again once the statute of limitations has run.

6
7
8
9
10

And so this statute of limitations is not a
matter of minimal import.
QUESTION:

Well, the California Supreme Court,

in announcing under State law, didn't give it that
fundamental sweep at all.

11

MR. NAJERA:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

It has been likened to the Double

It -- it had --

We're bound by what -- how California

characterizes its own statute I assume.
MR. NAJERA:

To some extent, yes, and to some

15

extent, no, because in ex post facto analysis, it is this

16

Court that looks at State law and it's this Court that

17

makes a determination whether or not it violates ex post

18

facto regardless of what label a State may give it in

19

particular.

20

Lindsey, and it certainly was reaffirmed in -- in Carmell.

21

That principle was announced in -- in

QUESTION:

But we -- we have to -- we have to

22

take the State law as we -- as we find it.

I mean, if the

23

Supreme Court of California says a law meant one thing, we

24

don't come in and say it meant another.

25

changed the law and therefore it's ex post facto, but we

We can say you've

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

don't decide for ourselves over the -- overruling a State

2

court what that particular law said at a particular time.
MR. NAJERA:

3

Well, the Court looks at -- at the

4

substance of the matter I believe.

5

whether or not the law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,

6

and it would seem to me that simply changing labels would

7

be an easy way for a State to get around the Ex Post Facto

8

Clause.

9

matter of substance, not a matter of form.

10

The Court looks at

As the Court said, as early as Cummings, it's a

And California, throughout its history, up until

11

Frazer granted, had always considered statute of

12

limitations to be matters of substance.

13

simply remedial matters or not simply procedural matters.

14

They were matters of substance and they were matters of

15

rights for the defendant or the person accused.

16

QUESTION:

They were not

Your -- your claim doesn't fit very

17

comfortably under any of the four Calder v. Bull factors,

18

or categories I should say, of ex post facto violations.

19

You're trying to shoehorn it under the rule of evidence

20

category, number four?

21

MR. NAJERA:

Whether -- Your Honor, whether

22

comfortable or not, I believe it fits, and I believe that

23

it fits within each of the four categories, not only

24

because of the nature of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but

25

because of the multifaceted nature of the statute of

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

limitations at issue here.
For example, if we look at Calder category

3

three, which deals with punishments and the laws that are

4

annexed to the punishment, in the case of Lynce, which I

5

believe was authored by Your Honor, in that case what was

6

at stake was not what the State had defined as the

7

punishment per se, the number of years.

8

there was that the State itself had granted credits,

9

overcrowding credits.

What was at stake

They did not even intend to -- to

10

give a benefit to the defendant there.

11

within Calder three because the punishment had been

12

reduced by laws that were annexed to the crime, the laws

13

dealing with the overcrowding.

14

And yet it fell

And in that way, one can say if the Court

15

rejects the principle that this is a material ingredient

16

of the offense itself, as California has defined it,

17

certainly as a matter of punishment, it is a law that's

18

annexed to that punishment and says, after a certain

19

period of time, no punishment shall be had.

20

And that's quite clear under California law

21

because it is not a waivable right.

In other words, a

22

person can go ahead and proceed to trial or go ahead and

23

plead guilty and be languishing in prison and suffering

24

the punishment and years later discover that he has a

25

statute of limitation right and assert it then and

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

punishment shall be had no more.

2

And so in that way I do believe it fits within Calder

3

category --

4

QUESTION:

He must be released.

That -- that's the law in California,

5

what you just said, that even though you never raise it as

6

a -- as an issue in your trial, and you're in -- you're in

7

prison, many years later you could then come in and under

8

California law if it -- if the statute had run, you would

9

be released?

10

MR. NAJERA:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That

11

-- that has been held over and over in California since

12

its early days and reaffirmed in particular in the McGee

13

case which was seminal in California and which defined it

14

not just merely as a matter of defense, not just merely as

15

a -- as a right of the defendant, but also as a matter of

16

jurisdiction for the court.

17

it very clear that since no offense could be stated, no

18

jurisdiction could be had by the court.

21

QUESTION:

And in that case, they made

Then -- then what was the effect of

the Frazer case?
MR. NAJERA:

Well, the Frazer case certainly

22

tried to redefine the history, I believe, of -- of the

23

California law.

24

dealt with a subsequent statute of limitations enacted

25

well after the statute of limitations applicable to

petitioner in this case and reinforced by 805.5 in 1985.
QUESTION:

So did the Frazer case overrule some

3

of this California doctrine on statute of limitations that

4

you've just told us about?

5

MR. NAJERA:

It certainly overruled cases such

6

as Sobiek which had held that, in fact, this was a

7

violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8

matter of legislative grace, they did not touch cases such

9

as Zamora which occurred in 1976, the same year that the

While calling it a

10

statute of limitations would have expired here, that

11

reaffirmed that this was in fact a substantive right.

12

And I might note that even while using the

13

language legislative grace, this Court in Weaver said even

14

if good-time credits are given as a matter of legislative

15

grace, it does not bar application of ex post facto, and

16

so such credits cannot be taken away, even though they had

17

not, in that particular case, been earned.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Najera, could -- could you

19

explain to me -- I -- I understand your argument that this

20

falls within the fourth category of Calder because you

21

have to produce more evidence under the -- or I'm sorry --

22

less evidence.

23

for conviction.

24

show that the crime was committed by an earlier date and

25

after this, you don't have to show it was committed by

It alters the amount of evidence necessary
Before the statute, you -- you had to

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that earlier date.
But if that's the case, what I don't understand

2
3

is why it makes any difference whether this increase -- or

4

decrease in the amount of evidence necessary to convict

5

occurs before or after the old statute of limitations has

6

run.

7

the amount of evidence necessary to convict.

8
9
10
11

In either event, it -- it amounts to a decrease in

MR. NAJERA:

Well, there's certainly an argument

that can be made, and -- and I know that amicus has -- has
in a footnote addressed that.
My -- my belief is that what must be shown is

12

not a particular number of years per se, because that can

13

be altered I believe.

14

before the -- before a court is that because the number of

15

years requisite of the statute of limitation has in fact

16

passed, therefore the case is no more.

17

consider the number of years, but the number of years only

18

matter as to whether or not the statute has, in fact, run

19

in that particular case.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

What must be shown by the evidence

So, yes, one does

Well, I hear you but I -- I don't --

I don't really -QUESTION:

I suppose you could also say that

23

even though literally it would apply to both situations,

24

there's a longstanding tradition of not applying it in the

25

case where the statute has not run, and so you would

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

construe that exception rather narrowly.
MR. NAJERA:

2

That is correct.

The State of

3

California throughout has told all of its citizens you no

4

longer need to keep your guard up because the statute has

5

run.

6

If you have letters that might be of some support in your

7

case, you don't have to maintain them.

8

witnesses, you no longer need to know where they are or --

9

or how to get a hold of them.

10

QUESTION:

If you have evidence, you don't have to preserve it.

If you have

And that only --

Am I correct -- just so I get your

11

view on it -- am I correct that with respect to an

12

unexpired statute of limitations where there's an attempt

13

by the legislature to extend it, the law is really very

14

well settled that that's permissible?

15

MR. NAJERA:

Yes, and in particular in

16

California because in the same year that the Sobiek case

17

was decided, in which the court said it is a violation of

18

ex post facto to revive an expired cause of action, in

19

that same year they decided People v. Snipe, which was an

20

extension case.

21

court there had no problem saying there is no ex post

22

facto problem there.

23

The statute had not yet run, and the

If -- if I might continue, and I would like to

24

attempt to address all -- all the relevant categories.

25

Turning to category number two, for example,

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there we deal with a situation in which a crime is

2

aggravated or enlarged and the opposition says, well, this

3

only deals with punishment.

4

Calder categories deal with -- ultimately with punishment.

5

Nevertheless, it is a situation that is simply not

6

redundant to the other categories.

7

itself.

8

be a great deal of case law on the point, one must still

9

ask the question, when is a -- when is a case aggravated

10

in a fashion that doesn't merely mirror one of the other

11

Calder categories, and I believe it's when the

12

jurisdiction is increased, when persons who fall outside

13

of the statute become ensnared in it.

14

Well, in one respect all

It is a category unto

And -- and even though there does not appear to

And if I might, unless there is an additional

15

question, at this point I would like to reserve the

16

remaining time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET GAARD

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22
23

MS. GAARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Based on new evidence that children who have

24

been sexually abused often delay reporting the crimes for

25

substantial periods of time, the California legislature

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

extended the statute of limitations for the most serious

2

of these offenses and it expressly made the law

3

retroactive.

4

Clause or the Due Process Clause.

This law does not violate the Ex Post Facto

Turning first to ex post facto, this law does

5
6

not criminalize conduct that was innocent when it was

7

done.

8
9

QUESTION:

Before you go through the four

categories, might I just ask this general question?

What

10

if the defendant had been pardoned, would it be an -- an

11

ex post facto violation to -- for the legislature to say

12

we're going to now make it subject to prosecution?

13
14

MS. GAARD:

No, Your Honor, it would not violate

the Ex Post Facto Clause.

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. GAARD:

And why not?
Because what we're looking at with

17

those four categories is what the law was in effect at the

18

time the crime was committed, whether or not it was an

19

innocent act that was later criminalized.

20

effect on the -- whether or not the act was innocent at

21

the time it was committed.

22

ex -- a statute of limitations, that there would not be a

23

change in the ex post facto.

25

QUESTION:

A pardon has no

So I would say that is like an

I'm sorry.

I really didn't

You say that the pardon would be treated

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

differently than the statute of limitations.
MS. GAARD:

2
3

No.

It would be treated the same

for ex post facto purposes.

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. GAARD:

6

QUESTION:

Oh, it would be treated the same.
Yes.
And what about a general amnesty for,

7

say, illegal aliens coming into the country and then

8

Congress passes a statute saying we will forgive the crime

9

and you cannot be prosecuted?

10

The same analysis there

too?
MS. GAARD:

11

With an amnesty, I don't -- I

12

believe it would be the same with the ex post facto.

13

There may be some separation of powers issues.

14

be double jeopardy issues, and there may be due process

15

issues.

I suppose it would depend on the circumstances.
QUESTION:

16
17

Well, why would those issues be

different in that situation than in this situation?
MS. GAARD:

18

I believe that they actually would

19

be very similar, but it would depend.

20

amnesties are conditional or some --

QUESTION:

22

MS. GAARD:

QUESTION:

24
25

There may

No.

I think sometimes

Unconditional in my hypothesis.

An unconditional?
Just like a pardon but a legislative

decision.
MS. GAARD:

Then what you would look to would be

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

due process there, which you also can look to with an ex

2

post facto change.
QUESTION:

3
4

Then why can't we look to due process

in this case?
MS. GAARD:

5

I don't think that you look to

6

substantive due process.

7

expressed earlier is when we have an explicit textual

8

source of protection, which we have here, you don't look

9

to substantive due process.

10

of procedural due process.
QUESTION:

11
12

The protection comes by way

But that would be the same for the

pardon and the amnesty.

I believe that what was

And another preliminary question.

15

You started out by saying these are very troublesome kinds

17

of cases.

18

is across the board.

19

MS. GAARD:

20

QUESTION:

21

Yes.
Doesn't -- it could be -- it could be

pickpocketing and -- and the argument would be the same.
MS. GAARD:

Clause --

MS. GAARD:

And the Ex Post Facto Clause has been

2

interpreted in terms of the four Calder categories.

3

I'd like to do is -- is focus primarily on categories one

4

and four which this Court has said are mirror images of

5

each other.

The first category prevents the State from

making an act that was innocent when it was committed

says whether or not the defendant committed the crime, the

State is not going to be able to prosecute.

15

And it's related to guilt or

The statute of limitations has no relation to
It's a defense that's raised that

And when you look at whether or not the crime

16

existed, what you look at is the definition of the crime

17

as set forth by the elements.

18

to the Frazer opinion, footnote 22, where the California

19

Supreme Court has said, whatever its nature for various

20

State law purposes, the statute of limitations is not an

21

element of the offense insofar as the definition of

22

criminal conduct occur.

And I would refer the Court

23

The California Supreme Court has said that the

24

crime that's at issue in this case is set forth in Penal

25

Code section 288, and the statute of limitations has no

relation to that.
Interplaying with the category one is category

four.
QUESTION:

May I ask you before you get to four?

5

May I ask you just to spend a -- a moment on something

6

that -- that hasn't been the focus of much?

7

category two that -- that refers to ex post facto as

8

something that makes greater or more serious a -- a crime

9

that was previously defined.

10

And that is

It seems to me that there are two sort of

11

indexes of seriousness in a crime.

12

penalty in the strict sense that is -- is provided for it,

13

but another index seems to me, the period of time after

14

its commission that a person who committed it is liable to

15

be prosecuted.

16

that judgment is being changed here.

17

offend the second category?

18

One is the -- the

That is a judgment about seriousness.

MS. GAARD:

And

Why doesn't it

I believe when you're talking about

19

increasing the punishment, what -- what the -- the cases

20

have looked at is the punishment that exists at the time

21

of the crime.

22

whether or not the term of a punishment is 1 year or it's

23

20 years, and I don't think that there's authority --

24
25

And it really is the actual punishment

QUESTION:

But -- but that isn't exactly the

term that at least that -- that Calder used.

I mean, it

5

committed.

6

aggravation greater concept isn't necessarily limited to

7

the index of punishment, and it -- it could refer to the

9

period of liability to prosecution.

And it seems to me that the -- that the

MS. GAARD:

10

It -- it refers to every law that

The second Calder category, if we

11

look back at the historical basis for that, comes from the

12

creation of a new punishment that wasn't in effect at the

13

time.

14

QUESTION:

Well, that just replicates the third.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

That makes it totally redundant.

17

MS. GAARD:

Well, I -- I don't think so because

18

the second one was, for example, where the new punishment

19

that was imposed was banishment which didn't exist at the

20

time as a penalty for the prescribed crime.

21

is the increase in the punishment.

22

punishment, I don't think that holding a defendant liable

23

for a longer period of time is the type of punishment that

24

this Court has looked at when it has applied those cases.

25

What we're looking at is the purposes of the Ex

The third one

But creating a new

that he knows whether or not he should commit the crime.

QUESTION:

Well, the same -- that's here. Isn't

that here?

5

MS. GAARD:

6

QUESTION:

Excuse me?
I mean, isn't that present here, at

7

least in respect to the evidence?

I mean, a person as --

8

as -- for example, this particular defendant you would

9

like to prosecute, among other things, for crimes that

10

were committed in your view 43 years before the present --

11

before the time of indictment and 22 years anyway since

12

the statute of limitations expired.

13

that during that time people would have thought that they

14

didn't have to keep records, that they didn't have to keep

15

all the evidence, that they might not have to defend

16

themselves.

17

on the other side, but also memories can be revived

through hypnosis.

MS. GAARD:

QUESTION:

If you're --- what I'm -- I'm trying to trigger

3

your reaction as to some of these fairly obvious points as

4

to --

5

MS. GAARD:

I guess you have -- you have touched

6

on a couple of things.

First is repose and second is

7

potential for prejudice.

8

exists because of the passage of time, not necessarily

9

because of the retroactive change.

And the potential for prejudice

So the fact that the

10

evidence may be somewhat stale is a function of the mere

11

passage of time, and as the Court is aware, there -- the

12

State could impose no statute of limitations so we could

13

have a case that was 40 years out and that would be the

14

same issue.

15

But in terms of --

QUESTION:

But the point -- the point, of

16

course, is that -- that in Calder v. Bull, the Justice

17

says, all these and similar laws are manifestly unjust and

18

oppressive.

19

the ones on evidence and so forth, seem to be about the

20

kinds of things you're talking about.

21

And some of the purposes here, particularly

MS. GAARD:

The Court has said, and similar, but

22

this Court has repeatedly held, most recently in Carmell

23

in 2000, that the four Calder categories are the outside

24

parameters, and that a law, to be ex post facto, needs to

25

fall within one-fourth of -- one of those four.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

And in terms of the prejudice, there is
protection -QUESTION:

3

But the Calder category in -- in

4

Carmell, the opinion of the Court said that category

5

covers instances where the Government refuses after the

6

fact to play by its own rules, altering them in a way that

7

is advantageous only to the State to facilitate an easier

8

conviction.

9

description of the fourth category, this case would seem

10

If that was the Court's most recent

to fit in it.
MS. GAARD:

11

But I believe what the Court said

12

there was that what was impermissible or unfair was

13

undermining a presumption of -- of innocence, and that's

14

not relative when you have a statute of limitations.

15

Innocence is of no import.
So what the Court said was in Calder category

16
17

one, you cannot change the elements of the crime

18

retroactively, and in Calder category four, it said you

19

can't change what the prosecution has to prove with

20

respect to those four -- or those elements.

21

change the presumption of innocence, which the Court spoke

22

to in the Cummings case, and you can't lower the

23

sufficiency of the evidence required to prove the elements

24

of the crime, which is what the Court was saying in

25

Calder.

So you can't

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

And in fact, if you find that changing this

2

would -- would implicate the fourth Calder category, then

3

you may want to look at Gut v. Minnesota where the Court

4

held that a change in a venue did not implicate any of the

5

four Calder categories.

6

that would also change the fourth Calder category which

7

this would.

8

And also --

QUESTION:

And if you were to change venue,

May -- may I ask you this -- this

10

question?

11

engaged in kind of a definition of what the categories

12

mean, as well as an analysis of what you have.

13

agree that if we do not fit this case within one of the

14

Calder categories, that -- and -- and we accept your

15

position, that we will have to overrule Hale and -- and

16

Henkel, the -- the case holding that -- that in fact, the

17

-- the Fifth Amendment cannot be pleaded once the -- once

18

the statute has expired?

19

Obviously, the -- you know, the -- we're

No.

Would you

I think what that would be is

20

so long as the statute of limitations has expired and not

21

been revived, that there is no present threat of

prosecution --

23

QUESTION:

Oh, in other words, the -- one could

24

be required to present evidence against himself and then

25

the next morning the State could say, hey, we've had a

4

Hale and Henkel.

5

We're going to extend the statute of

Is -- is that your position?

MS. GAARD:

Yes, but I think that you would have

6

to suppress that statement because it would be unfair.

7

That would be an act of misleading by the State to say you

8

would have to -- to testify and then we're going to use it

9

against you.

So as we said, we don't believe this fits

10

within the -- one of the four Calder categories, but the

11

protections come by way of -- or the procedural component

12

of the Due Process Clause, that if in fact there has been

13

actual prejudice, the -- the defendant may raise that as

14

he may in any instance where there is a pretrial delay,

15

and then the court will weigh that versus the reasons for

16

the delay, which is the test that this Court --

17

QUESTION:

Would -- would that -- and I -- and I

18

think this is your position.

19

if the statute is extended before it has expired.

20

MS. GAARD:

That would equally be true

Yes, it would be.

Whenever there's

pretrial delay, you use the test that the Court enunciated

in Marion and reiterated in Lovasco, and that's where we

QUESTION:

But your strongest argument against

3

Justice Souter's initial point, which I thought was --

4

that the word aggravated -- every law that aggravates a

crime, treating that as a kind of catchall where, in fact,

6

it isn't literally within the other three, but from the

7

point of view of purposes, it's the same.

8

against treating that aggravating a crime as a kind of

9

catchall is?

I don't think that that was the

It was the creation -But you could treat the banishment

were treating it as a catchall.

MS. GAARD:

Yes.

It was the creation of a new

punishment.

23

to be a catchall, and this Court has never interpreted it

24

Then -- then there's no problem here.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

If the State -- if the State

3

says no, then the only question that would arise in a

4

pardon is if you start to analogize it to a agreement

5

situation like Santobello because in some pardon

6

situations, it's like an offer and it has to be accepted.

7

You can't just force a pardon on somebody.

8

an offer and an acceptance, you could potentially

9

analogize it under the due process principle of Santobello

And if there's

10

where the government can't withdraw from an agreement

11

without implicating the Due Process Clause.

12

With respect to an amnesty, there would not be,

13

again, an Ex Post Facto Clause violation, and there would

14

not be a -- any other sort of due process violation,

15

again, once again, unless it fell into the Santobello kind

of situation or the Raley kind of situation where the

Government offers something, it's accepted, and then it --

So has something changed or were they all wrong or what's

the view?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But it seemed to be accepted.

The -- in this Court's decision

in Collins, it recognized there had been some disagreement

10

about the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause in prior

11

cases, and with some courts saying that it goes beyond the

12

four categories to capture laws that operate to the

13

disadvantage of the defendant in some important way and

14

with other courts saying it's limited to the Calder

15

categories.

16

and said that the Ex Post Facto Clause is limited to the

17

four Calder categories.

18

things that operate unfairly to the disadvantage of the

19

defendant.

20

In Collins, the Court resolved that debate

There is not a fifth category of

Now, that was the analysis that Judge Hand used

21

in the opinion that you refer to.

He did not say that

22

this violates any of the four categories.

23

said this operates to the disadvantage of the defendant in

24

an unfair way, a line of analysis that this Court ruled

25

out in Collins and reaffirmed ruling it out in Carmell.

He essentially

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

The same thing is true of the State court

2

decision that Judge Hand referred to in the first in the

3

line of those decisions, Hart v. Moore.

4

acknowledged that this law, changing an expired

5

limitations period, does not violate any of the four

6

Calder categories.

7

with the spirit that underlies the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8

Well, again, this Court's decision in Collins absolutely

9

rules out that line of analysis.

It frankly

It said, though, we are going to go

In order to find an Ex

10

Post Facto Clause violation, you must find that it

11

violates one of the specific Calder categories.

12

QUESTION:

I didn't think that Hand or American

13

Jurisprudence or the cases or Roscoe Conkling or the civil

14

or any of these things said one thing one way or the other

15

about whether it fell within the categories.

16

I'm right on that, which is why I'm raising it.

17

and if I -- if I -- but if I am right, can you use the

18

second category, anything that aggravates a crime?

19

seems to aggravate a crime to say that this crime would

20

have been prosecuted for 3 years and then we change it

21

retroactively and say it could be prosecuted for 50 years.

22

I mean, that seems to aggravate the -- so what is your

23

response to those --

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

And two -- no.
In Hart v. Moore, which is the

5

key precedent that Judge Hand referred to, it's just an

6

1880 case, the -- the Court said that it doesn't violate

7

the four Calder categories.

8

spirit underlying the clause.

9

And so it -- it relied on the

In the case of Judge Hand, he didn't undertake

10

an analysis under the four categories, but he undertook

11

the kind of a catchall fifth category analysis that some

12

of this Court's cases suggested was possible at the time,

13

but that the Collins case said is not.

14

Now, with respect to the question of category

15

two, category two, this Court explained in the Carmell

16

decision, is traced to Wooddeson's discussion.

17

said that there are two kinds of laws that affect

18

punishment.

19

one increases the severity of the punishment.

20

the Court said in Carmell is that Justice Chase precisely

21

adapted those concepts into his category.

22

changing -- creating a punishment.

23

increasing the severity of the punishment.

24

the limit of what those two categories involve, and

25

neither of those are implicated in this case because the

Category two is

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

punishment is exactly the same in form and amount as that

which was prescribed at the time of the offense.
QUESTION:

3

It is odd, Mr. Gornstein, isn't it,

4

that we take as gospel something that was said en passant

5

in -- what year was Calder against Bull?

6

And the case in fact decided it wasn't an ex post facto

law.

of the case one way or another.

9

Very early on.

So this was dictum en passant, and it didn't dispose

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But -- but the situation is not

10

that the -- it is stare decisis from that case.

11

stare decisis from subsequent cases like Collins and

12

others which have concluded that Justice Chase accurately

13

determined the limits of the Ex Post Facto Clause based on

14

the historical evidence of what the Framers thought,

15

including Wooddeson and Blackstone and -- and State

16

constitutions, and the Framers and other sources that he

17

relied on.

18

decisions of the Court have held that, including Collins.

He was right.

23

any defense available according to the law at the time the

24

act was committed.

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

It used the word

In -- in Collins, what the

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court said is that -- that prior cases had used that

2

formulation of any defense and in particular Beazell.

3

what Collins did was to clarify that the only defenses

4

that are available are those that go to excuse or

5

justification at the time the offense is committed.

6

it merges it then with the first category which deals with

7

changing laws and criminalizing conduct that was innocent

when done.

you can't change under the Ex Post Facto Clause are those

10

that have the effect of criminalizing conduct that would

of the questions have been, and it's critical to

the State had a law that said that oral evidence can no

Changes in admissibility rules are

Now, explaining further why the fourth category

23

needs to be read in this way, there are several reasons.

24

The first is that's the way the Court has applied the

25

fourth category.

In situations where there's been a

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

change in what evidence is sufficient to prove the first

2

-- to prove the defendant committed a crime, it found a

3

violation, as in Carmell and as in Cummings.

4

the change was -- there was a change in what was

5

sufficient to establish some other precondition that

6

doesn't go back to whether the defendant acted criminally

7

at the beginning, the Court hasn't found a violation.
And -- and the example is Gut v. Minnesota where

8
9

But where

there was a change in the venue rule.

What was changed

10

there -- change was -- was sufficient to prove venue,

11

which was a precondition to guilt, but it didn't change

12

what was sufficient to prove that the defendant acted in a

13

criminal manner when he acted.

14

there was no fourth category violation.

And the Court said that

Also, the statutes of limitations for over 100

15
16

years -- all the courts have concluded that if you

17

retroactively amend an expired limit -- I'm sorry -- an

18

unexpired limitations period, there's no Ex Post Facto

19

Clause violation, and in terms of the Calder category

20

four, there's absolutely no difference between those

21

statutes and this one.

22

sufficient to show that there is a timely prosecution.

23

neither case does it change what's sufficient to show that

24

the defendant committed -- when he acted, he committed a

25

crime.

In both cases, it changes what's

And that is what category four is about.

Finally, in Carmell, this Court noted that

2

category four is a mirror image of category one, and it

3

said they both work together to prevent subversions of the

4

presumption of innocence.

5

category four supports the conclusion of the linkage

6

between four and one that the -- what you're talking about

7

are rules that change what evidence is sufficient to show

8

that the defendant's conduct was a crime when he acted.

And that description of

And that's not -- and the statute of limitations

It changes what's sufficient to

show that there's been a timely prosecution.

defendant committed a crime when he acted.

It doesn't

QUESTION:

Other than the

reference to the language in the four categories, is there

any precedent of this Court supporting the Government's

position?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The -- the only precedent -- and

20

it's mild precedent -- is the Stewart v. Kahn decision

21

where the Court was examining a retroactive tolling period

22

during the Civil War, and the Court -- the issue actually

before the Court was the civil component of that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO NAJERA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NAJERA:

9

Thank you, Your Honor.

I'd like to, first of all, answer one question.

10
11

It's clear by California law that post-conviction, a

12

person can raise, either by habeas or other appellate

13

relief, the statute of limitations claim.

14

clear since Ex parte Vice and was reaffirmed in the McGee

15

case.

16

That's been

Turning to the Collins question, the real import

17

in Collins was not to get caught up in distinctions or

18

labels such as substantive versus procedure, and it would

19

seem that if we began to draw such distinctions here, we

20

run ultimately into the same problems.

21

to me that if Collins stands for the proposition that

22

affirmative defenses, defenses which the defendant has the

23

burden of establishing, are protected, why are not

24

defenses that the district attorney must disprove such as

25

the statute of limitations?

And it would seem

For this has always been, in

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

California, the burden upon the prosecution to show that

2

the statute has in fact not run.
Also, it seems that the State wishes to shift

3
4

the burden and foist it upon the petitioner and says,

5

well, we can address this in procedural due process, while

6

in fact that, as I said, foists the burden onto the

7

petitioner when the burden in fact lies with the

8

prosecution.

9

And in the Marion case, Supreme Court case, the

10

Court reaffirmed that an irrebuttable presumption of harm

11

occurs by such delay, and that's by way of the legislative

12

act.

13

Finally, I'd like to note that not only would

14

finality be upset in these particular cases, but really

15

what we're talking about is respect for the laws.
