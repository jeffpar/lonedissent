ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. HAMILTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
From the enactment of the 1966 Highway Safety

11

Act, a congressional report, specifically number 17 to the

12

89th Congress, which is quoted on page 2 of the blue

13

brief, congressional reports noted that, quote, no other

14

part of the State program is as basic to ultimate success,

15

nor as demanding of complete cooperation, end quote, as

16

State collection of accident reports, because they are the

17

basis for hazard identification and correction.

18

However, soon after the 1973 Highway Safety Act

19

made accident data collection a condition to Federal

20

hazard elimination funds the Secretary of Transportation

21

reported to Congress that States strongly objected,

22

because they feared that their collection of accident data

23

would be used against them in damage actions.

24

this, unintended liability exposure threatened the

25

integrity and proper operation of a cooperative Federal-

3

Because of

1
2

State program that has saved thousands of lives -QUESTION:

Would you help us figure out how to

3

interpret this statute?

4

MR. HAMILTON:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It says data, highway safety data

6

compiled or collected by a State.

7

a crossing like we have here, where there might have been

8

accidents from time to time, that there would be police

9

reports or highway officer reports of motor vehicle

10

Now, I suppose that in

accidents at that site, right?

11

MR. HAMILTON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And those presumably are not either

13

compiled or collected for the purpose of getting highway

14

funding from the Federal Government.

15

gather, to serve the normal functions of law enforcement.

16

MR. HAMILTON:

17

completely correct.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HAMILTON:

20

They're compiled, I

Your Honor, no, that's not

No?
They are collected and compiled

for purposes of highway hazard identification --

21

QUESTION:

Isn't --

22

MR. HAMILTON:

23

QUESTION:

-- from the very beginning.

Well, don't you suppose that at least

24

in some jurisdictions, maybe not Tacoma, but in some

25

jurisdictions you will find just ordinary police

4

1

reports --

2

MR. HAMILTON:

3

QUESTION:

Well, it's my --

-- of accidents, and sometime later,

4

perhaps the State might decide, or the county, I'd like to

5

have some Federal money to make some changes at that

6

crossing, and maybe we can use some of the data to

7

assemble it to try to apply for Federal money.

8

should we interpret that statute?

9

MR. HAMILTON:

Now, how

Well, in the -- if I understand

10

the hypothetical, the -- Your Honor is postulating a

11

situation where there is an accident report purely State

12

in origin.

13

a thing exists after the crash data forms.

14

understood that the Department of Transportation has been,

15

since 1966, working with the States to develop a uniform

16

crash data form, and that -- I think it's becoming more

17

and more successful as that goes on, so I'm --

Just to help the Court, I don't know that such

QUESTION:

18

It's to be

So your point is that the police

19

officers are using a kind of a unified Federal traffic

20

report --

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HAMILTON:

Essentially --

-- when there's an accident?
The forms are not all the same,

24

because each State has the right to choose how to put it

25

together, but the elements of the forms are dramatically

5

1

Federal in their nature, and they're Federal totally

2

directed toward the issue of highway design.

3

why -- Nation-wide there was a report cited by the

4

Washington State amici and multi-State amicus, amici

5

briefs that pointed out that Nation-wide before 1966 there

6

was no standard at all.
QUESTION:

7

That's

Well, let me ask you this.

At page

8

20 of the respondent's brief we have four different

9

interpretations, possible interpretations of the acts set

10

forth.

11

predicate before reaching the constitutional issue, and

12

I'll just -- and this is in line with Justice O'Connor's

13

question.

14

alternatives that she presents, then the opinion that we

15

would write, it seems to me, would be different than if we

16

took the more narrow, the most narrow view, and that leads

17

me to the question, do we have to have a statutory

18

construction at the beginning point of our holding?

19

Do we have to choose among those in order, as a

If we took the most expansive view of the

MR. HAMILTON:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

20

and the county's position, and we believe it's well-

21

founded, is that the constitutional issue is not an excuse

22

for artificially narrowly interpreting --

23

QUESTION:

Well, but I think that our Court has

24

always preferred, along the lines suggested by Justice

25

O'Connor and Justice Kennedy, to construe a statute to

6

1

avoid constitutional problems if we can, and certainly the

2

respondents here at least suggest there are several

3

different constructions.

4

which of those you favor?

5

MR. HAMILTON:

Are you not prepared to say

Well, I've -- I'm happy -- in

6

fact, I had intended to, if given the opportunity, to

7

provide the Court the way the county believes the statute

8

should be interpreted.

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, I'll give you that opportunity

right now.

11

MR. HAMILTON:

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

Yes, that's our question, and you

14

might bear in mind if you wish that I think we generally

15

construe evidentiary privileges narrowly.

16

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes.

However, as the Court

17

pointed out on that issue of narrow construction that --

18

in the Shapiro case, I believe, which was also a raw data

19

case whose purpose was to encourage participation, that

20

even after quoting the standard, the test of a narrow

21

construction -- the test was first put to Congress'

22

intent, and that the issue of, you know, that particular

23

rule of construction is not to be used in a way to

24

artificially narrowly interpret what Congress meant, and

25

if Congress meant something, then that's the test.

7

1

To answer Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist's

2

question, how does the county say the statute should be

3

interpreted, pretty much we agree with the logic of the

4

United States Solicitor General, but just would suggest

5

that the, their logic be extended to what we believe is

6

the logical conclusion.

7

plaintiffs that it only covers generated documents,

8

because under 409 that's interpretation conflicts with

9

what this Court has said the plain meaning of compiled

10

means, as this Court has discussed in the John Doe case

11

cited to the Court.

12

In other words, we disagree with

Also, this reads out of 409 the express

13

protection also of data collected, not just generated.

14

ignores the legislative history of why 409 was amended,

15

and why it used the language compiled --

16
17
18

QUESTION:
the other reading.

It

You're telling us what's wrong with
Which is your reading?

MR. HAMILTON:

Our reading, Your Honor, is that

19

there should be -- this Court should establish a bright

20

line rule that documents collect -- as the language says,

21

for -- we would ask the Court to enforce the language of

22

the statute, which reads, documents and data, quote,

23

compiled or collected for the purpose, end quote, of

24

specified highway safety programs, and here's the

25

operative language, quote, shall not be subject to

8

1

discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State

2

proceeding or considered for any other purposes in any

3

action for damages arising from any occurrence at a

4

location mentioned or addressed in those documents or

5

data.

6
7

In other words -QUESTION:

It doesn't say documents.

I mean,

you quoted it, you began the quote after --

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes --

-- after the noun.

10

MR. HAMILTON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HAMILTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HAMILTON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes.

I --

The noun you inserted was documents.
Yes.

There are specific --

It says --- references to specific types.

It says data, doesn't it?
It says data, and also lists

17

reports, lists -- and that sort of thing, and I was trying

18

to condense it down, but yes.

19

QUESTION:

To be plain, do you mean that

20

everything that goes to the Public Works Department,

21

everything that eventually gets to the Public Works

22

Department and is relevant to the safety of highway

23

crossings is exempt from discovery?

24
25

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes, Your Honor, that is what

we're saying.

9

1

QUESTION:

Every fact, so that if the Department

2

of Environmental Protection has prepared a report saying

3

the accidents are wrecking the grass and the flowers at an

4

intersection, and that report is then given to whatever

5

the data collection agency here is for this purpose, that

6

all of that data, including the data in the Department of

7

Environmental Protection, is then covered by the

8

privilege?

Is that your position?

MR. HAMILTON:

9

To the extent that that

10

characterization goes to the data that's in the reports.

11

It's not to say that -- all we're saying --

12

QUESTION:

That's my question.

13

MR. HAMILTON:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

The same data is in the environmental

That data is then given to the collection agency.

15

report.

16

Does the data, even in the hands of the Environmental

17

Department, become subject to the privilege at that point,

18

on your reading?

19

MR. HAMILTON:

We believe the -- again, if it

20

meets the test of dealing with an occurrence at a --

21

again, following the language of the statute, an

22

occurrence at the location mentioned or addressed in such

23

reports in the damage action, then that report that it's

24

collected and compiled by --

25

QUESTION:

I'm not talking about the report.

10

1

I'm talking about the fact which is reported.

2

MR. HAMILTON:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HAMILTON:

5

QUESTION:

Does that -- does that data --

6

QUESTION:

You can answer that yes or no.

7

QUESTION:

-- become subject to the privilege?

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

Yes.

The data in the report.
Well --

Yes, if Your Honor means, when

you say data, going to the report to get the data, to --

10

if you were to -- if that person wanted to raise that

11

issue were to go to the person who, or the entity that

12

created that information, and were to depose that, those

13

people, they could get the information that way.

14

we're talking about --

15

QUESTION:

All

Then your -- then the answer to my

16

question, I guess, is no, the data does not become, as

17

such, subject to the privilege.

It's only the data as

18

held by the collection agency.

You can still go to the

19

Environmental Department, depose them, get your

20

information?

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HAMILTON:

24
25

Yes, you can.

Okay.
Yes, and I'm sorry I

misunderstood you.
QUESTION:

Well, could you --

11

1
2

What if you don't have to depose

QUESTION:

-- go to the Police Department under

them?

3
4

QUESTION:

this uniform Federal form you were telling us about it?

5

MR. HAMILTON:

6

QUESTION:

7

I'm sorry, I missed the question.

You said at the outset that there's a

uniform document for collisions or crashes or something.

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

QUESTION:

10

out.

11

information?

Yes.

And the Police Department fills it

Can you go to the Police Department and get that

MR. HAMILTON:

12

Under our interpretation, you

13

could find the officer, you could depose the officer, but

14

you cannot get the report if it's collected and filed for

15

hazard identification.
QUESTION:

16

Well, so then Justice Souter's

17

hypothetical is different from this.

18

Souter's hypothetical that you could go to that Department

19

and get the document, but if you go to the Police

20

Department you can't get the document.

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

You said in Justice

No --

You didn't say he could get the

document.

24

MR. HAMILTON:

25

QUESTION:

No.

You said you could depose him --

12

1

MR. HAMILTON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and that was what my question was

3

going to be.

Are you drawing a distinction between

4

getting the document that was generated in the

5

Environmental Agency and deposing the person who made the

6

document?

7

MR. HAMILTON:

8

distinction that the cases make -QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

Why?

It says data.

10

about the cases.

11

It says data.

12

whether it's in some deponent's head.

I don't care

I care about the text of the statute.

It's data whether it's in a document or

MR. HAMILTON:

13

That's a

Data is data.

I think that certainly is a fair

14

interpretation of the statute.

15

synthesize how the courts have looked at this, and they

16

have drawn the distinction saying that really what the

17

purpose of this was to put plaintiffs back in the position

18

they were before.

19

data existed beforehand.

20

They didn't have this silver platter.

22

accident.

23

cases?

24
25

All this mechanism of creating accident

QUESTION:

21

What we're trying to do is

That's what they had to do.

They could get a police report of an

Isn't that standard routine in negligence

MR. HAMILTON:

Your Honor, before the 1966

Highway Safety Act they could not get an accident, a

13

1

collection of accident reports, at least in Washington

2

State, and it's my understanding Nation-wide, just by

3

asking for them -QUESTION:

4

But you could certainly get a

5

police -- at least judging from my own practice in Arizona

6

you could certainly get an individual police report of an

7

accident.
MR. HAMILTON:

8
9

that's the point.

Yes.

If you knew the -- and

You essentially have to know what

10

plaintiffs are trying to find out to get the document,

11

because you couldn't ask for all the accidents at this

12

intersection.

13

involved, but you couldn't ask for, give me all the

14

accidents at a particular intersection.

You could ask for a date and people

QUESTION:

15

No, but you could ask for the police

16

report of the particular accident that you were concerned

17

with.

18
19

MR. HAMILTON:
that's correct.

Prior to 1966, yes, Your Honor,

That's --

20

QUESTION:

I'm still slightly mixed up.

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

Imagine the forest service in the

23

State collects, because they have tree lovers, a piece of

24

paper that says the elm trees at the intersection of such-

25

and-such were diseased, all right.

14

Now, that's done for

1

purposes of tree health, and there's a piece of paper in

2

the environmental tree section which has that written

3

right on it, and one day the Transportation Department for

4

safety reasons says, send us a Xerox of that, okay.
The question I think Justice Souter was asking

5
6

and Justice Scalia, and I would certainly ask, is, in your

7

view, when they send a subpoena or discovery to the tree

8

department to get that piece of paper, can they get it?
MR. HAMILTON:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HAMILTON:

12

QUESTION:

No.

No?
No.

Very well.

Suppose that the

13

Transportation Department one day wrote a witness' name

14

down, an address which they got from the internal State

15

government telephone book.

16

plaintiff go and ask for a telephone book?

17

guess, is no.
MR. HAMILTON:

18
19

In your opinion, could a
The answer, I

Let me think about that for a

minute.
QUESTION:

20

Well, I don't see what the difference

21

would be.

They didn't collect the telephone book for

22

purposes of -- they didn't make the telephone book for the

23

purposes of accidents, but one day somebody went to the

24

telephone book and copied some information out of it for

25

the purpose of accidents --

15

1

MR. HAMILTON:

2

QUESTION:

I think what they copied --

-- and that's why, you see, exactly

3

why I find your interpretation of the statute rather

4

strained, so what is the answer to what my hypothetical

5

suggests?

6

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, since my answer would be

7

strained if I said the photo, the telephone book, what I'm

8

referring to would be what was written down for the

9

purposes, and collected for the purposes --

10
11

QUESTION:

But you said that they could not get

the piece of paper --

12

MR. HAMILTON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HAMILTON:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- in the Tree Division -The --

-- and all I'm having trouble is

16

distinguishing between the piece of paper written for tree

17

health and the address in the telephone book written so

18

people can know where people should be phoned.

19

MR. HAMILTON:

The piece of paper written for

20

tree help -- and I'm sorry I misunderstood the question.

21

I thought the Court was asking about the telephone book.

22

The telephone book, no.

23

written down from that, yes, because that's collected and

24

compiled, and that's really what the SHOTS case said, that

25

if there's a question about this of whether this was

The piece of paper that was

16

1

really fairly included for the purposes of 152, then for

2

that purpose you have an in camera inspection.

3

QUESTION:

But what is there that suggests that

4

Congress wanted to change the game to that extent?

5

can understand what you've suggested before, wanting to

6

keep personal injury plaintiffs in the same place they

7

were before this legislation, but your interpretation

8

takes away from plaintiffs things that they would have had

9

access to before.

10
11
12

MR. HAMILTON:

One

Your Honor, we -- respectfully,

we disagree with that characterization of our position.
QUESTION:

Well, you just, in response to the

13

Chief's question, said that at least the police report of

14

this accident was routine.

15

MR. HAMILTON:

The police report of this

16

accident, when you go and ask for -- and the reason why is

17

because -- because of the Highway Safety Act, 1966 Highway

18

Safety Act, the accident reports were indexed by location.

19

You could go and get a specific report if you knew the

20

facts enough of the accident, but only that accident

21

report, not all of them, and that is how 409 --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But that's not because of a

privilege, is it?
MR. HAMILTON:

Yes.

It is because of a

privilege.

17

1

QUESTION:

I thought the reason for that is the

2

police said, look, we don't have to do your homework for

3

you.

4

you don't know what you want, we don't have to search for

5

it.

If you know what you want, we'll give it to you.

If

Isn't that the reason?
MR. HAMILTON:

6

Yes, because the police don't do

7

that.

The police don't care about highway design factors

8

other than because the form asks them to.
QUESTION:

9

Okay, so in the past, then, and in

10

accordance with Justice Ginsburg's question, you could

11

have asked for the police report, and in Justice Breyer's

12

example, I presume you could have gone to the Tree

13

Division and said, let's have the slip of paper that says

14

the elm trees are diseased.
MR. HAMILTON:

15
16

Now, you can't do that.

Well, Your Honor, I believe

that -QUESTION:

17

And Justice Ginsburg's question is, I

18

thought it was supposed to leave things, as it were,

19

level, the way they were, that a disadvantage was not

20

being created, it was simply, the intent was simply to

21

avoid creating a new advantage which would deter the

22

State.

23

Isn't that the way we should read the statute?
MR. HAMILTON:

I think the purpose, yes, Your

24

Honor, is to avoid discouraging States from participating,

25

and allowing them to get accident reports from the hands

18

1

of third parties does discourage States from

2

participating.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HAMILTON:

5
6

Would you like to reserve your time?
Yes, I would, Your Honor.

Thank

you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR

10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The 1995 amendment to section 409 is, contrary

12

to the determination of the Washington State Supreme

13

Court, constitutional.

14

is compiled and collected for purposes of applying for

15

Federal highway funds from being used in State and Federal

16

court litigation.

17

Federal in character, and so Congress has the power to

18

prohibit the use of those documents in both Federal and

19

State court litigation.

20

The provision protects data that

The documents at issue are inherently

QUESTION:

Well, what about documents created

21

not for the purpose of getting Federal funds, not for

22

section 152, but for some other purpose, some of which are

23

later incorporated in a Federal funding application --

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

QUESTION:

I think those documents --

-- by a different agency?

19

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I think those documents, Justice

2

O'Connor, would be discoverable and admissible if the

documents were sought from the party that collected them

4

for a purpose different than the Federal highway funding

5

purposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is

6

somebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and

7

essentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise

8

where they can get all sorts of documents that have been

9

collected -QUESTION:

10

But you differ from petitioner in

11

your reading of the statute.

12

take it.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Yours is much narrower, I

That's exactly right, Justice

14

O'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the

15

statute, the typical police accident report can be

16

obtained from the Police Department and, I think with

17

respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about

18

the tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or

19

the State Environmental Department.

20

QUESTION:

Let me ask a somewhat different

21

question, although I'm not sure we've resolved the point

22

that we've been inquiring about.

23

right to waive this privilege?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Would a State have the

I think that's a difficult

question, Justice Kennedy.

I think that as you know, as a

20

1

general matter evidentiary privileges are waivable, and

2

so -- and that's the proposition this Court has

3

established in cases like Menzonato and Hill, but there is

4

a sense in which this privilege exists, in our view,

5

primarily for the benefit of the Federal Government, so

6

that we can obtain accurate, complete, and candid

7

assessments of highway traffic safety requirements, and

8

so, there's a suggestion, for example, in the Hill

9

decision at footnote 3 that, when a third party's

10

interests are at stake, that the court may not find waiver

11

under those circumstances as readily as it would

12

otherwise, so our view I think would be that although the

13

Court need not definitively resolve it in this case,

14

there's a strong argument that the privilege would not be

15

waivable.

16

QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt you, if I may.

17

Are you saying that the lawyer defending the county, if

18

the plaintiff called him up and said, I'd like to see

19

these reports, and the lawyer said, well, they're

20

privileged, but I think I'll give them to you because I

21

think it's in everybody's interests to know the facts,

22

that would violate the Federal statute?

23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the admissibility of those

materials -QUESTION:

I'm just asking you about showing

21

1

them to the plaintiff.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I think there's a sense in which

3

it would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not

4

suggesting that the Department of Transportation is going

5

to be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that

6

hypothetical and assert the interests of the statute.

7

think, however, if a State wanted to take a systematic

8

policy of disregarding section 409, I think that would

9

implicate the Federal interests, and I'm not sure that a

10

State would be able to do it.

11

QUESTION:

I

Well, supposing this simply comes up

12

during a trial.

13

about the preparation of a report, and the State doesn't

14

object, and it would be objectionable under the statute.

15

Now, is that something that could be challenged on appeal,

16

say?

17

A witness is put on the stand, asked

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Chief Justice.

18

I think it is something that could be procedurally

19

defaulted, but I do think if in a case like that the State

20

went to the trial judge and said, look, there is this

21

provision of Federal law, section 409, that says this

22

material can't come in, but we're happy to just disregard

23

that provision, I think the trial court might well be

24

within its rights to say that no, we're not going to

25

disregard that provision of Federal law, we're going to

22

1

keep the material out, but I do think it could be -QUESTION:

2

With these rights, is it a matter of

3

discretion for the trial court?

4

thing to say it's mandatory, it's a Federal requirement,

5

and now you're suggesting that the lawyer can overlook it,

6

and the court could or must act on its own?
MR. CLEMENT:

7

I mean, it would be one

Well, I'm suggesting that the

8

language of the statute is mandatory.

It says that it

9

shall not be admitted, so I think if the language is

10

brought to the attention of the trial court judge, he or

11

she would be in a position where they ought to exclude the

12

evidence.

13

QUESTION:

14

Federal Government?

15

wrong, that the Federal funding is not tied to the 409

16

privilege, but is tied to the 152 reporting obligations,

17

so what Federal enforcement would there be for a county

18

that says, we think it's fair for the plaintiff to have

19

accident reports, so we'll give them.

20

How would this be enforced by the
I understand, and correct me if I'm

What Federal -- how would that mandatory

21

requirement that you just stated be enforced by

22

authorities?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Federal

I think under the circumstances

24

that you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal

25

Government would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144

23

1

to that particular locality.
QUESTION:

2

So you're saying that the 409

3

privilege is not simply a right of the State agency, but

4

is -- that the funding depends on the State's asserting

5

that privilege?
MR. CLEMENT:

6

It certainly depends on the States

7

or the localities abiding by that privilege as a general

8

matter.

9

cavalier position of saying, we're just not going to be

10

bound by the provisions of this Federal statute, but yet

11

we'd still like to take the money under those three

12

statutes.

13

reason is, is that section 409, although it may benefit

14

the State in a particular litigation, does serve an

15

important Federal interest, and that is the interest in

16

getting complete and candid information to assess and to

17

award Federal highway funds.

18

I don't think a State or a locality can take a

I don't think that's permissible, and the

By analogy, I would suggest this Court look to

19

its decision in the Buckman Company v. Plaintiff's

20

Committee case, because in that case this Court recognized

21

that the FDA approval process, and the process for

22

applying for FDA approval, is inherently Federal in

23

character, and so this Court preempted State tort law that

24

might distort the effect of applying for FDA approval.

25

In the same way, the process of applying for

24

1

Federal highway funds and the documents that are used for

2

that purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so

3

the Federal Government has an interest in making sure that

4

the information provided to the Federal Government is

5

accurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has

6

the power to take those essentially Federal documents and

7

protect them both in State and Federal court litigation.
Now, I would suggest that the answer to the

8
9

waiver question, unlike the answer to the statutory

10

construction question, is not a necessary component of

11

this Court's decision.

12

it could be -- is that it could not be waived, at least in

13

gross.

14

an additional answer to any accountability questions that

15

may arise, but again, we think the better view is that it

16

can't be waived.

We think the better view is that

Of course, if it could be waived, I think that is

QUESTION:

17

Mr. Clement, one of the arguments

18

made by respondent Guillen is that -- is a Tenth Amendment

19

argument.

20

argument?

21

Do you think he has standing to make that

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the better view is that he

22

doesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll

23

also suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment

24

argument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult

25

question of whether or not an individual had standing to

25

1

raise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably

2

should have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the

3

conclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court

4

would be well-advised not to definitively decide whether

5

or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth

6

Amendment issue.

7

I --

QUESTION:

Why -- what's special about the --

8

this is just an assertion that the Federal Government has

9

no authority to do what it has done, and you say an

10

individual who has been harmed by the Federal Government's

11

exceeding its authority does not have standing to

12

challenge?

13

It seems to me we do it all the time.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

14

think all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal,

15

and I think therein lies the difference.

16

Amendment challenge is, is a mirrored reflection of

17

Congress not having the enumerated power to enact a

18

statute --

If all the Tenth

19

QUESTION:

But that's all it --

20

QUESTION:

How about a Commerce Clause

21

challenge?

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

In those kind of

24

cases, the individual does have standing, but this Court

25

on various occasions has suggested that there's an

26

1

additional component to the Tenth Amendment, that it's not

2

just a reflection of the enumerated powers of Congress,

3

but, rather, there are certain special areas of State

4

prerogatives that the Federal Government can't intrude

5

through congressional acts.
QUESTION:

6
7

the time in separation of powers cases.
MR. CLEMENT:

8
9

Well, we allow those challenges all

I think that's right, but Justice

Kennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems

10

different.

If the gravamen of the complaint is that

11

there's some element of State sovereignty that Congress

12

cannot intrude upon, and the State doesn't object to that

13

intrusion, it seems odd that the individual would have

14

third party standing to raise that objection.
QUESTION:

15

Why couldn't you say the same thing

16

for the Executive and the legislature in a case like

17

Chadha?
MR. CLEMENT:

18

Again, I think you could, and I

19

think that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth

20

Amendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power,

21

or the lack of an enumerated power, there would be

22

standing.

23

I think what this Court suggested -QUESTION:

I don't -- whenever the Government

24

goes beyond its enumerated power, it is infringing upon

25

the powers of the States, isn't it?

27

1

MR. CLEMENT:

2

QUESTION:

Well --

All the Tenth Amendment says is, you

3

know, other than the enumerated powers, the other powers

4

continue where they used to be, with the States.

5

words, I don't see anything special about a Tenth

6

Amendment claim.

7

QUESTION:

In other

In Buckley v. Valeo we held that the

8

Appointment Clause, where the President had signed the

9

legislation, could be raised by private individuals.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I understand that, and that

11

was also true in Chadha.

12

difference, and this Court suggested there might be a

13

difference in the TVA case, if there is a difference it's

14

because there are certain Tenth Amendment challenges that

15

have the nature of just an intrusion on State sovereignty

16

that's particularized.

17

have often talked about is moving a State capital, and if

18

the State doesn't object to moving the State capital, it's

19

hard to see why an individual ought to be able to raise

20

that question.

21

I think if there is a

The hypothetical that the cases

I think the more important point, though, for

22

this case is that there was a suggestion to this effect in

23

this Court's TVA decision.

24

that decision, it probably doesn't want to do it in a case

25

where the Tenth Amendment challenge is not properly raised

If this Court wants to revisit

28

1

and isn't even raised at all in the briefing before this

2

Court until the conclusionary section of the brief.

3

With respect to the enumerated powers questions,

4

which I think are the gravamen of respondent's case and

5

the Washington Supreme Court's decision, there's no

6

question the individual has standing.

7

this case, in this Court's decision in United States v.

8

Lopez and would be equally true here.

9

That was true in

And I think this Court can take comfort in

10

knowing that this is, at bottom, an enumerated powers

11

case, not a Tenth Amendment case in any specialized sense,

12

because the Washington State Supreme Court found it

13

unobjectionable that section 409 would apply in its pre-

14

1995 amendment version, and what that indicates is that

15

there's nothing sacrosanct about State courts' procedures,

16

or State evidentiary rules.

17

QUESTION:

Don't you think that our opinion in

18

the Commerce Clause case, in order to have persuasive

19

force, should begin with an interpretation of the statute,

20

recognize that a privilege can be waived or not waived?

21

find it very difficult to see how this opinion can be

22

written when we're not sure of the reach of the statute.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

I

I agree with you entirely, Justice

24

Kennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the

25

statute before deciding whether or not it's

29

1

constitutional, and we would urge the United States'

2

construction of the statute.

3

I would say that the waiver question is somewhat

4

different.

5

statute turns on the waiver question.

6

disagrees, we would urge the Court first to find that this

7

privilege is not waivable at least in gross and, second,

8

that even if it is waivable, the statute remains

9

constitutional.

10
11
12

I don't think the constitutionality of the

QUESTION:

If the Court

Do we have a final State decision

here, Mr. Clement?
MR. CLEMENT:

I think you do have a final State

13

decision, and I think that's most clear with respect to

14

the PDA action -- that's the State Public Disclosure Act

15

that was brought -- because in that case the Washington

16

Supreme Court held that the four documents were

17

disclosable and said that attorney's fees would be

18

appropriate.

19
20
21

In this --

QUESTION:

There was a fifth document, though,

and they didn't -- there was no appeal on that one, right?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, but there was no cross-

22

appeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think

23

that document is no longer part of the case.

24

Washington Court of Appeals held that four of the five

25

documents needed to be disclosed, Pierce County took an

30

When the

1

appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, but I don't

2

think that the Guillens filed a cross-appeal suggesting

3

that the fifth document ought to be disclosed, and so I

4

really think the fifth document is no longer in the case,

5

and since the Washington Supreme Court found that

6

attorney's fees were appropriate, that means that there

7

was a final judgment.

8
9

QUESTION:

That's true both at the --

Mr. Clement, there was -- you said

that the PDA suit, the four documents were required to be

10

turned over under that, but I thought the Washington

11

Supreme Court said that accident reports from nonofficers,

12

from witnesses, would not be disclosable under the PDA,

13

though they would be subject to discovery under rule

14

26(b), so the notion that the PDA suit was the one that

15

determined that these four documents were required to be

16

turned over, I don't understand that, because I thought

17

there was one part at least, the reports from nonofficers,

18

that the county prevailed on before the Washington Supreme

19

Court, but that it was a Pyrrhic victory because they lost

20

on that point under 26(b).

21

MR. CLEMENT:

That's not how I read the

22

decision, Justice Ginsburg.

23

decision as the four documents were clearly going to be

24

disclosed as part of the PDA action.

25

QUESTION:

I thought -- I read the

Did you read the decision to say that

31

1

these documents are not disclosable under our Freedom of

2

Information Act, nevertheless they can be discovered in a

3

civil litigation?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

That's not, with respect, how I

5

read the opinion.

6

documents are disclosable under the PDA.

7

objection to disclosure under the PDA that was raised by

8

the county was section 409, and with that issue resolved

9

against the county, I took the import of the decision that

10
11

I read the opinion that those four
The only

those documents would be disclosed.
At that point, I think it's clearly a final

12

decision, because this Court has held in the Beckton

13

Dickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the

14

fact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand

15

doesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that

16

decision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I

17

would think that the same rule would apply in both

18

contexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final.

19

I think the tort action is a more difficult

20

question as to whether that's final.

I think this Court

21

might have to change its -- to modify its precedents a

22

bit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of

23

what Congress has done here.

24

analogous to a case that this case found final called

25

National Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case

I think this case is quite

32

1

there was a State venue provision that a Federal statute

2

trumped, and the State supreme court found that the --

3

this Court found that the State's decision saying that

4

State law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I

5

think the cases are quite parallel.

6

They both involved congressional efforts to

7

modify State procedure in order to serve a Federal

8

interest, and in both cases when the State court

9

disregarded the Federal interest and either through

10

constitutional means or statutory means found the Federal

11

statute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a

12

final judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by

13

extension of that decision, they could find a final

14

judgment here.

15

I think the main difference between this case

16

and Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the

17

position that upon remand there would be no further

18

litigation available in the State court where the lawsuit

19

was filed.

20

Here, there might be some litigation that would

21

go on in the tort action, for example, but I think the

22

important thing is that the Federal interest has been

23

extinguished, and I think if there's any play in the

24

joints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that

25

this would be a particularly important case to find a

33

1

final decision, because an act of Congress has been held

2

unconstitutional.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Do we need to find finality with

respect to both?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

6

think that these actions are severable.

7

consolidated for purposes of appeal before the Washington

8

Supreme Court, and I think that --

9

QUESTION:

They were

So if I don't want to wrestle with

10

the complexities of the tort action, what would we do,

11

just dismiss that case as improvidently granted and decide

12

the other one?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that would be fair, or

14

this Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say

15

that it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action

16

and decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of

17

the State PDA action, and --

18

QUESTION:

Well, we can't ignore it.

19

we've taken the case.

20

got to do something with it.

We've granted certiorari.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

QUESTION:

Just hide it under --

23

QUESTION:

There's only one case --

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

I mean,
We've

Well, I --

I mean, I think that this Court

could say that to the extent that the tort action is

34

1

before it, that that action is not final, and that -- or

2

they're not going to -- the Court's not going to

3

definitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is

4

final.
I would -- this Court in a different context

5
6

actually managed to bifurcate a single case and say that

7

one part of the case was final and the accounting action

8

that was subject to remand was not final.

9

W. W. -QUESTION:

10
11

That's the

We wouldn't want to do that too

often, I think.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. CLEMENT:

No, no, but I think if you can do

14

that in a single case, I think you can certainly do it in

15

a case like this, where they started as separate actions,

16

were consolidated only for purposes of appeal, and really

17

have separate life.

18

If, for example, this Court hadn't exercised

19

jurisdiction, what would have happened is that the two

20

cases would have gone back down.

21

have been essentially over, because as the county

22

suggested, there's nothing left in the PDA action on

23

remand.

24

action went back to the trial court, then it would have

25

been appropriate to appeal that on a separate track from

The PDA action would

The tort action would go on, and once the PDA

35

1

the tort action, and there would have been really no point

2

to making the county go through that exercise, and so I

3

think the PDA action is final.
If there are no further questions, I think the

4
5

important submission from the Government is that the 1995

6

amendments can be given force in a way that renders them

7

still quite well within the Congress' power under the

8

Commerce, Spending, and Necessary and Proper Clauses.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SALVADOR A. MUNGIA

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MUNGIA:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The statute does have to be construed, but

15
16

regardless of how the statute's construed, it clearly does

17

not meet this Court's requirements under South Dakota v.

18

Dole because 409 is not conditional.

19

language of 409, and it's not conditional in nature.

20

a mandate, and if somehow it could be construed as being

21

conditional, it's certainly ambiguous, as we've seen many

22

interpretations and many questions as to the operation of

23

409.
409 cannot be justified under the Commerce

24
25

You read the plain

Clause.

It does not regulate commercial or economic

36

It's

1

activity.

Instead, it regulates State courts, and that is

2

the peculiar nature of this dispute, because what is at

3

issue is, is what does a State -- this is completely an

4

intrastate concern.

5

QUESTION:

Why is it intrastate?

If you simply

6

have a -- if you interpret the statute to say, a document

7

that is prepared primarily for this -- for getting money,

8

primarily for getting money out of the Federal Government

9

can't be discoverable in a tort action?

What part of the

10

Constitution would that violate, if that's how you

11

interpret it?

12

You'd get all your documents, I guess, and so

13

would anyone like you, but that seems to be basically what

14

the Government's arguing --

15

MR. MUNGIA:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MUNGIA:

Justice --

I -- yes.
Justice Breyer, I agree with the

18

Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, we

19

still get our documents, and I do want to make it clear

20

for the record, and I think it's clear in the briefs,

21

Pierce County took a different tack on this and had a very

22

wide scope of interpretation.

23

there still has to be authority under the Commerce or

24

Spending Clause, and I may not get it in this issue if we

25

get our documents, that's correct, but I'm saying that no

However, despite that fact,

37

1

matter what, the act has to have authority under some

2

article I, section (a) basis.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that's certainly right, and so

4

Congress says, we have a Federal interest in trying to

5

minimize accidents, and in order to do that, we want to

6

get information from the States when they want our money,

7

and to be sure the information is accurate, we want to be

8

sure that at least the information they give us, they're

9

collecting with an eye towards being accurate rather than

10

with an eye towards protecting themselves from tort

11

litigation.

12

MR. MUNGIA:

13

QUESTION:

14

Justice --

It sounds reasonable to me.

What's

unreasonable about that?
MR. MUNGIA:

15

Justice Breyer, because the

16

analysis starts, is this commercial or interstate activity

17

that in fact the Federal Government is regulating, and

18

they're not, they're regulating State courts.

19

again --

20

QUESTION:

And

But they're regulating in the

21

interest of a commerce-type thing that's preventing

22

automobile accidents.

23

MR. MUNGIA:

That is the disputable part, as to

24

whether or not there's any evidence in, within -- not only

25

in the record, or anywhere that can be found, whether this

38

1

action, indeed, would prevent any further accidents.

2

the statute does --

3

QUESTION:

All

When Congress makes that judgment,

4

don't we owe it substantial deference?

5

going to sit as a committee of Congress to determine

6

whether there's a link between the condition of these

7

intersections and vehicles going in and out of States.

8

Congress made that judgment, it's not for us to question

9

it, is it?

10

MR. MUNGIA:

That is, we're not

If

Justice Ginsburg, that is the

11

historic and that is the correct analysis.

12

been very deferential to Congress', even if there's

13

something within the information source that could support

14

that reasoning, and again I'll go to U.S. v. Lopez and

15

U.S. v. Morrison for that proposition, where in U.S. v.

16

Lopez, there were no congressional findings at least this

17

Court alluded to.

18

This Court has

They do not have to make congressional findings,

19

as long as there's something out there, some information,

20

and the same thing with U.S. v. Morrison.

21

Congress did make a congressional finding, this Court said

22

we're not going to necessarily find that in fact they had

23

a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

24
25

QUESTION:

Even when

May I ask you just to back up for a

moment to address the question that Mr. Clement did about

39

1

the separateness of these two?

2

tort action that you are seeking that's different from the

3

PDA action, or are these essentially two actions seeking

4

the same material?

5

MR. MUNGIA:

Is there anything in the

Justice Ginsburg, no.

They are

6

seeking different materials, and the materials we sought

7

in the tort action were much broader than what we sought

8

in the Public Disclosure Act, and the materials -- I do

9

want to say this as far as that, there is no judgment in

10

the tort action.

I mean, that should be clear.

11

no final judgment.

12

taken up on interlocutory appeal.

There is

This is a discovery order that was

13

Now, whether or not there is a final judgment in

14

the PDA action is a closer question, but I would point out

15

to the Court, page 114 of the Washington State Supreme

16

Court's opinion that you'll find at Appendix A-114 directs

17

the lower courts to make their rulings in accord with the

18

court's opinion, and did not simply say these documents

19

either are or are not discoverable, and thus it is

20

debatable whether or not there is a final judgment even in

21

the Public Disclosure Act case.

22

QUESTION:

But the way you interpreted it,

23

although you say it's debatable, is that everything that

24

falls under the PDA, everything that -- those four

25

documents, those are not available to you.

40

That's what

1

Mr. Clement said, I think, that that's what rendered the

2

PDA action final.
MR. MUNGIA:

3

Correct, and I read the opinion

4

differently, where in fact we do get those documents, and

5

I -- we may have a fight back at the trial court as to the

6

language of the Washington State Supreme Court, because I

7

realize in its opinion it said that those would normally

8

not be discoverable under the PDA, but then you have to

9

look at the purpose of the documents.
QUESTION:

10

You set forth four alternative

11

interpretations at page 20 of your brief.

12

documents involved in either of the tort action or the PDA

13

action comprise just those set forth in your category 1,

14

which is reports and data that the State agency actually

15

prepares itself?
MR. MUNGIA:

16

Do any of the

Justice Kennedy, the documents that

17

we sought under the PDA, even under the narrowest

18

construction, under the narrowest construction, we get the

19

documents, just on a statutory construction under the PDA

20

request.

21
22

QUESTION:

But some of the documents you

requested fit naturally within your category 1?

23

MR. MUNGIA:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MUNGIA:

Correct.

All right.
And so at least in this case, this

41

1

Court need not address the constitutional issues, finding

2

no final judgment in the tort action and, in fact, a

3

narrow construction for the PDA action.
QUESTION:

4

I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood.

5

You say the documents that you requested fell within

6

category 1?
MR. MUNGIA:

7

Of our interpretation, which is a

8

very narrow construction of the statute.

9

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

10
11

That's correct,

In other words, they were documents

that were actually prepared to get highway funds?

12

MR. MUNGIA:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MUNGIA:

No, I'm sorry, if I --

That's what I understood you to say.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

I'm saying we

15

would get those documents under our construction.

16

other words, they do not fall within the parameters of

17

that narrow construction, because these are documents that

18

in fact were prepared by another agency.
QUESTION:

19

In

So in your view, none of the

20

documents that you're -- that are in dispute fall within

21

category 1.
MR. MUNGIA:

22
23

is correct, not the tort action but the PDA action.
QUESTION:

24
25

Correct, under the PDA action, that

Do they fall in category 2?

tell us?

42

Can you

1

MR. MUNGIA:

No.

If they don't fall within

2

category 1 -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.

3

within category 2, yes, they would.

4

those documents would fall within -QUESTION:

5
6

If they fall

Under the PDA action,

Documents the agency has in its

possession?
MR. MUNGIA:

7

Correct, they fall within category

8

2.

And I do want to point out to this Court that, in

9

fact, Pierce County's position, and it's shown in the

10

record, was that we could not even discover the names of

11

witnesses or the names of the people involved in the

12

accidents, and that's surely not part of the Federal

13

highway funding data, because why is the Federal

14

Government concerned with the names of the people involved

15

in the accidents, and I think this is a concern about

16

putting documents, if you will, in a black hole and

17

allowing certain information which our supreme court has

18

held is essential to the proper determination of these

19

claims, based upon State and local law.
They are essential to those determinations going

20
21

in, and now no longer being discoverable.

22

a very basic concern with this statute, and why at least

23

one reason it should take a narrow construction, or at the

24

very widest, the construction put forward by the Solicitor

25

General.

43

I think that is

1

QUESTION:

But the construction put forward by

2

the Solicitor General, as I understand it, is you can get

3

it from the agency, like a law enforcement agency, but not

4

from the Public Works Department if the purpose is to

5

implement the Federal program.

6

position?

7

MR. MUNGIA:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's the Government's

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But under that position, I suppose,

in the day when we have this great data base and all

10

reports are there initially, then under the Government's

11

approach, everything would be exempt from discovery.

12

you read their position to say that?
MR. MUNGIA:

13
14

Do

Correct, Justice Ginsburg, I do,

and that is the day, if it's not today, that this court -QUESTION:

15

No, I didn't read it that way.

I

16

thought what they were saying was consistent with if it --

17

and maybe it's in this case.

18

mean, if you ever have the great single data base, you'd

19

look to see whether the document was primarily created for

20

the one purpose or the other.

21

created for accident reports, you get it.

22

primarily created to get money from the Government, you

23

don't.

24

not sure we have to reach it, but if we did?

25

I don't think it is, but I

Where it's primarily
Where it's

I mean, does that work as an interpretation?

MR. MUNGIA:

Justice Breyer, as far as

44

I'm

1

interpreting the electronic portion, it probably is a

2

reasonable interpretation, and you're right, I mean, it's

3

not part of this case, but it probably will have to be

4

faced sooner or later.

5

Going back to the scope, again, because we are

6

talking about the interpretation of this, Pierce County

7

took the position they were -- and this is in the

8

companion Witmer case, which is the one -- there was a

9

companion case at the State level, where private highway

10

surveys done by, I believe it was the McDonald's and a

11

Chevron Company, which the county then took within its

12

possession, it was unwilling to disclose because under

13

409, so again I think the county's position was a very

14

broad one, that anything that goes in within their

15

possession then becomes nondiscoverable and you cannot use

16

it, which I think is a completely unreasonable

17

interpretation.

18

I do want to take a few minutes and talk about

19

the Spending Clause, because this is not a condition.

20

you read section 409, the plain language of 409, it's

21

mandatory, and surely when Congress has intended to use

22

its Spending Clause powers, I think especially in the

23

Federal highway setting, it's been very clear.

24
25

QUESTION:

If

I don't see how you can characterize

section 409 as a condition.

It's an incentive provided

45

1

to -- for the State to participate in this Federal funding

2

program.

3

from the State, and thinks that they'll be more apt to get

4

it by providing the protections of section 409.

5

see it as a condition at all.

The Federal Government hopes to get information

MR. MUNGIA:

6

I don't

Justice O'Connor, I agree.

I don't

7

think it's a condition either.

8

it as an incentive or something else -- they term it as a

9

mandate.

10

Whether you want to term

I think regardless of how you term it, then it

cannot be authorized under the Spending Clause.

11

QUESTION:

But --

12

QUESTION:

Well, why not?

It's a necessary and

13

proper means of ensuring that the Federal money is spent

14

wisely and efficiently.

15

there, frankly.

16

MR. MUNGIA:

Now, I don't see the big issue

Under the Spending Clause analysis,

17

this Court has long gone through through Pennhurst,

18

through South Dakota v. Dole, and just recently in Durham

19

v. Gorham, it's clear that the conditions have to be

20

spelled out.

21

Now, this is clearly some sort of imposition,

22

and if it's not Spending Clause, then they'd have to have

23

it under the Commerce Clause authority, which goes under

24

another analysis.

25

QUESTION:

You'd have another --

46

1

QUESTION:

No State has to participate in this

2

program if it doesn't want to.

3

down Federal money it can, can it not?
MR. MUNGIA:

4

If a State wants to turn

It can turn down Federal money, and

5

that's the interesting, Mr. Chief Justice, about 409.

6

Again, just reading the plain language of 409, it is

7

mandatory, and there's no provision -- even if you cross-

8

reference to 152, there's nothing which puts anybody on

9

notice about how this -- how a State can avoid the

10

mandates of 409.

11

QUESTION:

Well, it can avoid --

12

QUESTION:

But you can agree, nonetheless, that

13

a State can refuse to participate?

14

reading 409, tell that it isn't just a legislative command

15

based on something other than the Spending Clause, but

16

don't -- you do agree, don't you, that if a State didn't

17

take the Federal money, it would not be bound by 409?
MR. MUNGIA:

18

You say you can't, by

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's

19

an open question, and I don't necessarily agree with that.

20

I think you have to read the plain language, and it seems

21

like Congress is saying you will do this.
QUESTION:

22
23

You think it's just categorical,

then?

24

MR. MUNGIA:

25

QUESTION:

Correct.

But how could that be if -- how could

47

1

any document be collected for the purpose of participating

2

in the Federal program if the State doesn't participate in

3

the Federal program?
MR. MUNGIA:

4

Because if you read section 152,

5

what it mandates States to do is come up with a list and a

6

survey of hazardous sites.

7

that's the mandatory part.
So Congress, if it has the authority, can tell

8
9

That's all it says, in 52(a),

the States, do this list.

Now, the question, that begs

10

the question whether or not Congress has that authority.

11

I think then that's when you have to turn to the

12

Commerce -QUESTION:

13

Do the list whether or not you have

14

any Federal money, is that what you're saying?

15

not tied to Federal spending.

16

saying.

17

States whether or not they receive any Federal money.

18

that how you read 152?

19

This is

That's what you seem to be

That it's independent Federal obligation on the

MR. MUNGIA:

Is

Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.

20

I think if you read the plain language, 152, unlike 23

21

U.S.C. 131, 141, 159, 161, where it's clear that Congress

22

says you must control highway billboard signs or you lose

23

10 percent of your funding, you must control size and

24

weights of vehicles that go on interstate highways or you

25

lose 10 percent of your funding.

48

Those are all clear.

1

In fact, in the Dole case, under 23 U.S.C. 158,

2

I think that the title of the act was withdrawal of

3

Federal funds.

4

QUESTION:

Aren't we losing sight of the fact,

5

the rather plain fact that the States and the counties

6

wanted this?

7

originally because they feared these documents would be

8

discoverable, and make the county liable.

9

another Spending Clause case where the States and the

10

counties came to Congress and said, please give us a

11

privilege, and then say, well, now it's mandatory and it's

12

some kind of a club rather than a carrot?

13

They weren't satisfied with the program

MR. MUNGIA:

Do you have

Justice Ginsburg, I have two

14

responses.

15

that same sort of analysis in New York v. U.S., where the

16

Solicitor General argued that because New York officials

17

wanted the benefits of the Low-Level Hazardous Waste Act,

18

therefore it cannot later challenge certain provisions of

19

that act, and this Court rejected that argument.

20
21
22

One, I think actually this Court addressed

QUESTION:

But this very provision they wanted,

not the thing in general.
MR. MUNGIA:

And that goes -- then to my second

23

part of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental

24

part of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the

25

States wanted this protection they had the means to do it

49

1

themselves, and this Court has explained, again citing

2

from New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the

3

benefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the

4

citizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the

5

division of separate powers, so it really, just because

6

State officials want it, it's clearly that the people of

7

the State of Washington did not want this, because it

8

infringed upon a State cause of action.

9

so that the State supreme court was willing to hold it was

10
11

In fact, so much

unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Well, that goes to the waiver point.

12

I assume the State can waive it if its citizens instruct

13

it to do so, or maybe not.

14

MR. MUNGIA:

The Government says no.

I -- Justice Kennedy, you look at

15

the language, and in fact you look at the early responses

16

by Pierce County, where Pierce County clearly said, we

17

cannot -- I mean, we must -- we don't have that choice.

18

We cannot --

19

QUESTION:

The hypothetical is that the State

20

could waive it if it wanted to.

21

MR. MUNGIA:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MUNGIA:

That's the --

And Justice Kennedy --

-- hypothetical question.
Yes, and I -- Justice Kennedy, my

24

response is, I don't see how the State could, because I

25

think just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the

50

1

Solicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I

2

guess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic.

3

think that's the whole problem here.

I

Under the recent cases under the Commerce

4
5

Clause, and again I just want to spend a couple of minutes

6

on the U.S. v. Lopez and Morrison cases, it seems clear

7

that again this type of activity, what's being regulated

8

is, in fact, State courts, in fact, the admissibility, the

9

discovery of evidence, and that is certainly intrastate,

10

and there's no contention here that somehow justice, or

11

the discovery of documents is somehow commercial in

12

nature, and you cannot make that argument, so I think

13

there is no basis under either the Spending or the

14

Commerce Clause to support this legislation.
QUESTION:

15

Well, is it irrelevant under your

16

argument that the object of the Federal legislation is

17

safety in an artery of commerce?

18

point?

19

MR. MUNGIA:

Is that beside the

Justice Souter, the object at least

20

for the Federal Highway Act is safety.

21

same thing can be said about 409, because then you're

22

becoming -- as this Court said in U.S. v. Lopez, you're

23

building inference upon inference, because you have to go

24

and say, if these documents are no longer, in fact,

25

discoverable, would it result in safer interstate travel,

51

I don't think the

1

and there's just too many intermediate steps.
QUESTION:

2

So you that think the Federal

3

interest in this case is comparable to the Federal

4

interest in Lopez, the ultimate interest?
MR. MUNGIA:

5
6

I think that the -- Justice Souter,

the Federal interest in section 409 -QUESTION:

7

No, I'm talking about the ultimate

8

Federal interest that gives rise to all of this

9

regulation, which is the safety of an artery of commerce.

10

Are you either disputing that that is the object, or are

11

you saying that that object is on par for constitutional

12

purposes with the significance of the Government's object

13

in Lopez?

14

MR. MUNGIA:

Justice Souter, I think it's more

I'm saying that the Federal Government

15

the latter.

16

certainly has an interest in the safe passage of

17

interstate --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. HAMILTON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

23

Very quickly -- 3 minutes, quickly -- I would

24

like to correct I think what was a misstatement by

25

respondent's counsel, or at least one of them, dealing

52

1

with what the Court should do if it adopts the United

2

States' position.

3

position, then they get the documents.

4

Plaintiffs say that if you adopt that

I'll point out that on page 24 of their own

5

respondents' brief they say their -- interpretation

6

number 2, which they say the U.S. reflects, they say on

7

page 24, if the Court construes the statute in this

8

fashion, then a remand would be necessary to determine

9

which specific discovery requests would be precluded and

10

which would be, still be allowed.

They're not entitled,

11

even under their own admission, under the U.S. position,

12

and in fact I would point out on page 20 of our reply,

13

yellow brief, where we point out that in fact, if that

14

were the case, even if the U.S. position were adopted,

15

these particular documents would have to be protected.

16

Furthermore, obviously there is some confusion

17

as to where we differ with the United States, and it's a

18

very narrow difference.

19

documents are protected.

20

compiled documents in the hands of Public Works are

21

protected, and we both agree that in some situations

22

they're protected in the hands of third parties.

23

We both agree that generated
We both agree that collected and

They, though, very narrowly define that in

24

situations where the third party gets it, is a transferee

25

agency, where you can only get it by indexing, or where

53

1
2

it's part of a computer base.
I would ask the Court to consider its own

3

St. Regis Paper Company case, where it addressed a statute

4

that only made a protection when it was in the hands of

5

third parties or officials, and it contrasted the language

6

of that statute with other statutes, 45 U.S.C. section 41,

7

and 49-320, whose wording is almost identical to 409.

8

you would compare those, you would see that the case

9

distinguished those types of statutes from a statute only

10
11

If

protecting in the hands of third parties.
So whatever 409 does, it certainly protects more

12

than just in the hands of third parties, and I would also

13

like to point out, the reason why we differ from the U.S.,

14

we believe their logic is correct with protecting in the

15

transferee hands and in a computer data base and where

16

it's indexed, but if you carry that logic through, we

17

believe a bright line rule should be established by this

18

Court, because obviously the State courts have been

19

very -- some State courts, a minority of State courts have

20

been very resistant.

21

Other State courts have been trying to do their

22

best to comply with the language of the statute, but some

23

States, of course, have found every opportunity to try to

24

misinterpret the statute, and it required Congress at

25

least twice to amend the statute to get back to what they

54

1

intended.
When you look at the situation of why they

2
3

wanted, the Solicitor General believed that documents in

4

the hands of the transferee agency are protected, they

5

said that the reason for that was that they would not

6

exist but for the planning agency's collection of that

7

information.

8

exist in their totally different form, they would not be

9

indexed and therefore accessible, and they would not be in

10

the county's possession but for the Highway Safety Act, so

11

you extend that logic through, then you come to a bright

12

line rule which we believe the Court should adopt.

Well, so, too, accident reports would not
