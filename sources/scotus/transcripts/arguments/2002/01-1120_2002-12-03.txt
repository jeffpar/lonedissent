JUSTICE STEVENS:

We will now hear argument in

Number 01-1120, Meyer against Holley.

Mr. Benedon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BENEDON:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The question -- excuse me.

10

The question

11

presented should be answered with the following bright

12

line rule:

13

FHA should be determined by application of established

14

rules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to

15

the FHA.

16

and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of

17

the other agents of the corporation.

Imposition of vicarious liability under the

Under these principles, corporate shareholders

The Ninth Circuit held that a different rule

18
19

should apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could

20

be based on control alone.

21

the law.

That is not, nor should it be,

22

While the starting -- the starting point for the

23

analysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress

24

has authority to expand the class of persons liable for

25

violation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

done so expressly.

2

defines nor expands the class of persons liable under the

3

act, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence

4

is dispositive.

5
6
7

The FHA was never -- which neither

Specifically, Congress has spoken directly when
it has wished to impose a control test.
QUESTION:

For example --

Suppose -- suppose that I were to

8

agree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to

9

your criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and -- and

10

that it agreed with you too that general principles of

11

agency and corporate liability apply.

12

record, could we go on to say that under California law

13

and real estate law generally, the real estate salesman is

14

the agent of the broker, and therefore the broker is

15

liable under agency law?

16

MR. BENEDON:

17

QUESTION:

Based on this

The answer --

Or -- or would I have to -- would we

18

have to remand before we did that?

19

discussed in the -- in the respondents' brief, and the

20

respondent makes it quite clear.

21

but the -- the law is cited on page 15 of the red brief,

22

that under California law, the broker is the principal.

23

And I take it the principal would be liable under

24

respondeat superior in this case.

25

MR. BENEDON:

Because this is

And maybe you disagree,

Correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

2

QUESTION:

If -- if we find who the principal

is, we know the principal is going to be liable.

3

MR. BENEDON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BENEDON:

My -- Your Honor, my answer to

that is -- is several-fold.
First, the distinction needs to be made between

8
9

Under California law the broker is

the principal.

6
7

That's where --

a corporate broker and an individual broker.

Mr. Meyer in

10

this case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's

11

license solely as the officer of the corporation.

12

corporation is the employer of the agent.

13

operates under the license held by the corporation.
QUESTION:

14

The

The agent

But isn't it fair to say that -- or

Maybe you'll take issue with this, that the

15

isn't it?

16

corporation operates as a broker only because it has the

17

individual's broker license assigned to it.

18

MR. BENEDON:

It has to, Your Honor.

19

A corporation as a paper person needs human beings to

20

fulfill the function that a corporation must do, as does

21

any corporation.

22

officers --

23

There will always be supervising

QUESTION:

Is -- is there any California law

24

saying that -- that the corporation is the principal in a

25

situation like this and not the holder of the -- not

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- not the named broker?
MR. BENEDON:

2
3

The named broker, again -- to

answer your question, no, not that I'm aware of.

4

QUESTION:

This -- this is a --

5

QUESTION:

Let me ask the opposite.

Is there

6

any California case in which the named broker in the

7

corporation has been held liable as the principal solely

8

because he's the named broker?
MR. BENEDON:

9
10

Honor.

The corporation has been held liable.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BENEDON:

13

Not the designated officer, Your

Yes.

That's what I'm talking about.

But not the designated

officer/broker.

14

QUESTION:

So --

15

QUESTION:

Is there a difference in the

16

licenses, the individual license that Justice Kennedy was

17

referring to and that's mentioned on page 15 of the red

18

brief, the individual broker license and the statement

19

that the individual broker licensee is vicariously

20

liable and the broker who holds the license under the

21

corporate name?

22

Are those different certificates?

MR. BENEDON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

There are

23

separate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate

24

in California:

25

one to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity

one to individuals who act as brokers, and

Those are separate

explained to Justice Scalia that there is no California

10

case holding a corporate broker liable in this situation,

11

as I understand.

12

other way?

13

presented to the California courts?

Are there any California cases going the

Has it ever -- has the issue ever been

MR. BENEDON:

14

Yes, it has, Your Honor.

In two

15

cases, there have been, one -- one State case and one

16

district court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in

17

the -- re Grabau case.

18

statutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for

19

any violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a

20

designated officer/broker who violates any of the

21

provisions of the statute may be subject to discipline,

22

but is not the basis of a civil action.
QUESTION:

23

They've held that the California

So in this case the individual could

24

be subject to discipline, but not to liability.

25

that --

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Is

1

MR. BENEDON:

Correct.

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

What were your other reasons.

You

4

said you -- you had a multi-faceted answer, or something

5

like that.

What -- what are the other --

6

MR. BENEDON:

7

QUESTION:

8

The --

-- prongs or the other facets of your

answer?
MR. BENEDON:

9

The other facets is that liability

10

under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law.

11

There, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on

12

Federal rules of agency.

13

this Court held in General Contractors, you look to the

14

Restatement which has a two-prong test.

15

of control, but the other is that the person controlled

16

has to be acting on behalf of the principal.

To determine Federal agency,

One is the right

Here, the agent works -- is working on behalf of

did real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of

20

Triad.

21

In this case when Mr. Crank went out and

He was not acting on behalf of Meyer.
The problem with looking at each State's

22

structure is we're going to end up with a patchwork

23

construction of a Federal statute.

than from West Virginia.

QUESTION:

Is that --

2

QUESTION:

Suppose it were the majority rule

3

that a real estate broker is the principal for the

4

salesman.

Would we follow that rule generally?

5

MR. BENEDON:

6

QUESTION:

Again, Your Honor, the --

And again, I'm -- I'm referring to

7

the red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this -- this

8

out.

9

corporate broker and -- and an individual broker.

You say there's a distinction because there's a

10

MR. BENEDON:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

Now, we -- I -- we can explore that a

12

little bit.

But suppose it were the -- the general rule

13

in most of the States that had addressed the subject that

14

the broker is the principal.
MR. BENEDON:

15

To answer that question, I think

16

you still need to make a distinction between individual

17

brokers and corporate licensed brokers.

18

that --

19

QUESTION:

We do not dispute

Well, I -- I was simply addressing

20

the point of whether or not State law as opposed to

21

Federal law controls.

22

States that the broker is the principal, then that would

23

certainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability

24

under this Federal scheme.

25

MR. BENEDON:

And if it's the general law in most

Would it not?

Again, I -- I disagree, Your

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor.

2

still look at the Federal law of agency rather than how

3

the State defines the relationship between the broker and

4

the agent.

5

agency to determine agency under the FHA.

6

I would say that the rules still -- you need to

You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of

QUESTION:

I thought you said those were general

7

common law principles that are -- presumably the States

8

would share.

9

MR. BENEDON:

The general law principles applied

10

in the broker/agent context would establish that the

11

agent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal

12

broker when the broker is acting in his individual

13

capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the

14

principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that

15

broker's control.

16

officer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation

17

is not acting on behalf of the officer.

18

behalf of the corporation.

19

QUESTION:

The situation is different when it's a

He's acting on

Then if I understand your argument

20

correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's

21

California law or Federal common law, is in this case at

22

least academic because under California law, if you were

23

to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that

24

the only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the

25

corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BENEDON:

To date, that is how California

2

has treated violations of the California statutory scheme.

3

Correct, Your Honor.

4
5
6
7

QUESTION:

Only -- only by these corporate

brokers or -- or by -- by individual brokers?
MR. BENEDON:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Individual

brokers as well.

8

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

MR. BENEDON:

It's a statutory scheme that

10

applies to brokers in general and salespersons in general

11

who -- who allegedly violate the act.

12

QUESTION:

But I thought you said that if -- if

13

this were a license to an individual broker, if this were

14

held -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual --

15

that he would then have a principal agent relationship

16

with Crank.

17
18
19

Is that not so?

MR. BENEDON:

That is correct, Your Honor, if

it's an individual broker's license.
I think I may have caused some confusion.

Under

20

general principles of agency law, common law principles of

21

agency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal

22

relationship with an individual broker.

23

violation of the act by the broker under California law,

24

then he would be subject to disciplinary action.

25

separate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA,

If there is a

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

That is

1

which would adhere based on the principal agent

2

relationship.
QUESTION:

3

Is there an issue in this case about

4

piercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer

5

liable?
MR. BENEDON:

6

Not in this case, Your Honor.

We

7

hold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil-

8

piercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as it

9

would be under any case under the general common law,

10

although here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's been

11

waived, and it's never been proven.

12

QUESTION:

But they came --

13

QUESTION:

Was there some reference to

14

veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth

15

Circuit?
MR. BENEDON:

16

On the last page of argument in a

17

footnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing that

18

based on sole ownership, that they could establish an

19

alter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient to

20

establish alter ego.
QUESTION:

In other words, the Ninth

2

Circuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well,

3

here's another theory on which we could prevail.

4

know -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but

5

if they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis,

aren't they then entitled to go back and make the case

MR. BENEDON:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

of sole ownership was sufficient to establish that point.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Right.

Well, that -- that's the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. SCHWEMM

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHWEMM:

18
19

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to begin by addressing the

20
21

veil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly with

22

respect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagree

23

with my learned friend on the procedural posture of this

24

case.

25

There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In the

1

complaint at that time, there were essentially two

2

theories.

3

liable as an individual because he owned the corporation,

4

and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be

5

liable because he was the officer/broker.

6

The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be

The district court granted in part, even with

7

respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion

8

and, in particular, held that the allegations of the

9

complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances

10

could lead to liability.

11

district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue

12

with respect to liability based on officer/broker.

13

And the only thing that the

That led to discovery.

The district court then

14

granted summary judgment because it was the district

15

court's theory on that issue that there could not be

16

liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's

17

license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is

18

a license through Triad, or more properly, according to

19

the California law, Triad holds the license through him.

20

So with all respect, what the district court

21

held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that

22

the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing.

23

We never got --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, could prove or -- or claimed

they could prove in response to the motion.

I mean,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

you -- you don't have to sit back and say, I wonder what

2

they might be able to prove.

3

an offer of proof, and -- and what the court held was that

4

none of the facts that you claimed you could prove would

5

suffice.

6

what -- what the holding of the court was?

7

You -- you have to have made

Isn't that an accurate description of -- of

MR. SCHWEMM:

And the facts that we alleged were

8

that Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation,

9

which they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose

10

individual liability.

And when the district court granted

11

12(b)(6) motion, my understanding of that is that he is

12

saying, under no set of facts will you ever win.

13

Now, what would --

14

QUESTION:

-- isn't that true that -- that you

15

have to have something more than simply a person being a

16

sole owner of a corporation?

17

create a corporation with himself as a 100 percent owner.

18

MR. SCHWEMM:

19

QUESTION:

Otherwise a person couldn't

So they're -- what

they're saying is you didn't allege anything than that,

The

Well, he didn't seem to, in his

opinion, understand it because the only reference he has

to veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph.

different argument, the argument that there could be no

veil-piercing because he didn't even own this corporation.

it was right.

MR. SCHWEMM:

QUESTION:

23

MR. SCHWEMM:

Our position --

-- is that the Ninth Circuit's

judgment was correct, but it went too far when it reached

25

out and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

beyond traditional principles of agency.

We think the

2

standard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the

3

employment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington

4

Industries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious

5

liability under the Federal statute should be a Federal

6

standard.

7

principles as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing

8

Act.

And that standard should be traditional agency

Now, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they

9
10

had to go beyond traditional agency principles.

11

we've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II,

12

and III is point out three separate and independent

13

alternative theories under traditional agency principles.

14

And in that sense, we -- we think the Ninth Circuit just

15

reached out and tried to do something that wasn't

16

necessary.
QUESTION:

17

What

Well, then is your piercing-of-

18

corporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law

19

theory?

20

MR. SCHWEMM:

Our position on that is that it's

21

probably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court

22

hasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that

23

this -- this is something that I don't have a position on.

24

But either way, we are entitled to a remand whether it's

25

Federal or California law.

But the cause of action

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clearly is the Fair Housing Act.
I believe the Government takes the position --

2
3

and we certainly don't disagree with the Government --

4

that it is a Federal question.

5

And if I may, I want to get into those parts I,

6

II, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part

7

and vicarious liability.
The problem we have with petitioner's argument

8
9

is that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions.

One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the

11

California corporation and real estate law that are

12

advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other

13

part, which is the responsibility part.

14

true that in California, a corporation can be a broker,

15

but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual

16

appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has

17

qualified under the broker requirements, and that

18

individual is required by California law to take

19

responsibility for the supervision and control of the

20

agency.
QUESTION:

21

It is literally

Yes, but your opponent says that

22

the -- the results under California law is he can be

disciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no

25

to do so.

that the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated

22

You said that California law says

The -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to

The only way he could use that license was as an

If you divide the corporation from

And none of the acts in this case, none of the

19

about the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is

it's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal

of these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these

when Mr. Meyer was trying to get the Triad license

MR. STEWART:

MR. STEWART:

plaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on

15

that Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad,

the president of Triad.

Mr. Meyer -- they alleged that Mr. Meyer was the sole

shareholder of Triad.

23

MR. STEWART:

And it's true that they -- they

didn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization.

25

However, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out, there was a colloquy

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

in the district court in which the petitioner's counsel

And when he reads

And apparently in the brief, a different

theory was produced, the one that's been produced today,

that the reason they're liable is not because we want to

pierce the veil, but because it's Mr. Meyer who's really

the holder of the license in some sense, and that is

sufficient.
So not surprisingly, the district court says

MR. STEWART:

But the Ninth Circuit clearly

19

understood the claim against Meyer as shareholder to be

20

distinct from or at least in addition to the claim against

Meyer as designated officer/broker.

Mr. Meyer played.

3

Now, it's true that the respondent by and large

and the Ninth Circuit appeared to regard these distinct

functions as separate and independent bases for liability.

6

But in our view, it's only a short step to say even if no

liability, the combination of functions, together with the

Mr. Stewart, as -- as I understand

12

the theory of why the failure to bring forward affidavits

it, the plaintiffs' theory is it wasn't necessary because

MR. STEWART:

appeal of the -- of the portion of the complaint that

5

It was not specific.

The -- the

6

appeal from the dismissal was with regard to Mr. Meyer's

7

potential liability as shareholder and the appeal from the

8

grant of summary judgment with regard to his potential

9

liability as designated officer/broker was based on the

10

grant of summary judgment.
QUESTION:

11

Well, so in addition to the complaint

12

being very vague, the -- the appeal of the dismissal was

13

pretty vague too.

14

if you were objecting to the dismissal of the -- of -- of

15

a veil-piercing theory, you -- you should have, it seems

16

to me, come forward and say, I object to dismissal of that

17

theory.

18

I -- I don't understand what -- I mean,

MR. STEWART:

I would acknowledge that the

19

theory that -- that we and the respondents have -- the

20

veil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court

21

is a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit.

22

But it's -- it's always been part of the case that

23

Mr. Meyer's liability was alleged on the basis of his

status as shareholder, his status as designated

officer/broker, his status as president.

MR. STEWART:

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the

2

veil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on

3

veil-piercing as such.

4

And another important criterion in determining

5

whether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the

6

individual bears some degree of personal fault for the

7

wrong alleged.

8

that Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that

9

was a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct,

And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is

10

and that would suffice to show that aspect of the

11

veil-piercing analysis.

12

I think it's also important to note that courts

13

are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort

14

cases than in contract cases; that this Court has

15

described the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially

16

defining a new type of tort.

17

contract cases, an individual who contracts with a

18

corporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the

19

corporation's finances and decline to do business if the

20

corporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its

21

obligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential

22

plaintiff has no opportunity to do that.

23

The theory is that in

Inadequate capitalization has always been an

24

important factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it

25

goes to the question whether the incorporators have

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

corporate entity.

submission on the proposition that under California law,

And is that because you accept the

distinction between a corporate broker -- a broker's

10

MR. STEWART:

I think it's partly that.

it's partly just the general background rule is individual

torts committed by the people they supervise.

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

21

MR. STEWART:

May I answer?

Yes.
If a consensus developed among the

22

States that designated officers/brokers were sufficiently

23

different from ordinary supervisors that they should be

24

held vicariously liable, then we would advocate that as

25

the general Federal rule.

But the respondent has not

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

MR. BENEDON:

Your Honors, I would submit at

Thank you.

I --

QUESTION:

Oh, excuse me.

11

QUESTION:

I do have -- I'm still -- what is --

12

what is your response to the -- to the assertion that it

13

was not necessary for the plaintiffs to bring forward any

14

affidavits or evidence at the summary judgment stage

15

because on the -- on the veil-piercing issue -- because

16

that issue was no longer alive at the -- at the summary

17

judgment stage.

18

It had been dismissed on the complaint.

MR. BENEDON:

I would start from the premise

19

that the veil-piercing theory was never born, not that it

20

wasn't alive.

21

Okay?

QUESTION:

In other words, you -- you concede

22

that then and -- and you -- you fall back on -- on the

23

simple fact that the veil-piercing theory was never -- was

24

never really contained in the complaint.

25

MR. BENEDON:

Never contained in the complaint,

I mean, it says

that -- that the -- the defendant violated the Fair

Housing Act when his agent discriminated.

That's what it

6

And then previously in paragraph 13, it lists a

7

whole lot of facts about the relationship of Mr. Meyer to

8

the company including the fact about the tax numbers and

9

so forth.
And so what they say is, you know, the complaint

10
11

doesn't have to spell out every theory, but it does state

12

some facts there from which this basis could be fairly

13

inferred, and therefore it shouldn't have been dismissed.

Rather, they should have had at least an opportunity to

argue it.

MR. BENEDON:

But again, we have to look at what

are the allegations in the complaint.
QUESTION:

Well, the allegations are just what I

had said, paragraph --

MR. BENEDON:

QUESTION:

23

MR. BENEDON:

There --

Yes.
There are allegations of sole

ownership, corporate -- that he was the sole owner, that

25

he was the officer/broker, and that he was the president,

and that the taxes were paid under his ID number, an

2

allegation that's never been proven.

3

I think most telling to what was the issue in

4

this case is the holding of the Ninth Circuit itself, and

5

that's at page 67 of the joint appendix where the court of

6

appeals states where common ownership and management

7

exists, corporate formalities must not be rigidly adhered

8

to, a holding which is clearly erroneous, but which sets

9

out what was the issue in this case.

The issue was not

Mr. Meyer as an individual be held liable because he was

13

the sole owner, president, and designated broker of

Excuse me.

And for that reason, the Ninth Circuit should be

reversed and the judgment of the district court in favor

of Mr. Meyer reinstated in full.
