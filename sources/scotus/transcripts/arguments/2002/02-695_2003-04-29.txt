ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Iowa Legislature, consistent with the Equal

12

Protection Clause, can charge different tax rates for its

13

riverboats and its racetracks for a number of legitimate

14

State interest reasons, including and especially the one

15

highlighted by the district court judge here, the

16

promotion of the development of river communities.
In 1983, Iowa broke ground and got more friendly

17
18

with gambling and allowed horse racing and dog racing in

19

our State.
QUESTION:

20
21

it.
MR. MILLER:

22
23
24
25

It's called gaming if -- if you favor

I -- is there a neutral term, Your

Honor?
In -- in regard to gaming, one of the main
purposes of having horse and dog racing was to develop a

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

new subset of our agricultural economy, the breeding,

2

training, and raising of horses and dogs.

3

succeeded.

4

industry.

And that

It turned out to be about a $50 million

Six years later, with visions of Mark Twain in

5
6

the background and the two incredible rivers in America

7

surrounding our State, the Mississippi and the Missouri,

8

the legislature authorized riverboat casinos, riverboat

9

gambling.

And one of the main purposes there was tourism,

10

economic development for the river communities and

11

riverfront development.

12

$17 million worth of investment along the various

13

riverfronts.

In a very short time, there were

A few years later, though, neither gaming

14
15

enterprise was -- was doing as well as they would like,

16

indeed, not doing -- not doing well at law.
In regard to the riverboats, the problem was,

17
18

well, Iowa had this sort of, in a way, naivete maybe about

19

betting.

20

riverboats.

21

lose more than -- more than $200 in one setting.

22

Illinois had a different view and had no limits and were

23

starting to succeed competitively.

24
25

They restricted the amount of bets on
It could only be a $5 bet and one couldn't
Well,

The -- the situation with the racetracks was
more severe, that economically it just wouldn't work to

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have racing, either horse racing or dog racing alone.

2

Iowa became the first State in the Nation to allow the

3

sort of the -- the golden goose of gambling, slot

4

machines, at racetracks.
QUESTION:

5
6

So now the bulk of the earnings are

from slot machines rather than the races.
MR. MILLER:

7

So

Is that right?

That -- that's right, Your Honor.

8

Indeed, really the slot machines support the -- support

9

the racing.
QUESTION:

10

But under your scheme, I take it the

11

highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is

12

36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on

13

riverboats.
MR. MILLER:

14

That -- that is correct, Your

15

Honor.

And that was provided on a -- on a graduated

16

basis.

Actually in next year it's -- the 36 percent would

17

be -- would be reached.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And you want to offer a rational

basis for that scheme?
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

And

21

what -- what we say is that the development of the -- of

22

the riverboats could be rationally preferred by the -- by

23

the legislature because of riverboat development, because

24

of economic development on the -- on the rivers.

25

Additionally, the -- the district court found

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that the additional rational basis could be sort of

2

supporting the riverboat enterprises as a -- as an

3

industry, promoting riverboat history.

4

Also, we argue that there was a problem of

5

riverboats leaving the State, that three out of six in the

6

previous -- previous to 1994, the legislation year, had --

7

had left the State.

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

Well, because of that legislation,

the Delta King left the Sacramento River and it's gone up
to the Mississippi.
MR. MILLER:

Well, that was the next purpose,

12

Your Honor, to try and get other boats to -- to come to

13

Iowa, and apparently --

14

QUESTION:

They're -- they're saying -- and

15

maybe there's -- I take it from their brief that, look,

16

there's never been a tax scheme like this.

17

State very often would -- would tax at a different rate a

18

handsaw and a screwdriver, but we've never heard of a

19

State that said when you sell a screwdriver, you pay 5

20

percent tax if you sell it in Des Moines and a 3 percent

21

tax if you sell it in Dubuque, and if it's sold by one

22

kind of a person, they sell 8 percent tax, and it's all

23

the same screwdriver.

24

been a -- really a tax system like this anywhere, and --

25

and they better have some pretty good reason or -- or

Obviously, a

So they're saying there's never

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

something.
I mean, now -- so is all that true, that there

2
3

never has been a system like that, saying the same

4

screwdriver, everything identical, all it is is it's sold

5

in different parts of the State or by different people,

6

and -- and you have to pay a different tax?
MR. MILLER:

7

Well, I think there's been many

8

times where the -- the taxpayer has been -- been treated

9

differently even if -- even if the transaction is the

10

same.

11

QUESTION:

Like what?

12

MR. MILLER:

Like what?

Sort of the -- the enterprise

13

zones, for instance.

14

favorable tax rates all the time for economic development

15

purposes and that's what's here.
QUESTION:

16

Communities are -- are given

And --

Typical -- typical sales tax.

You

17

know, the State may tax a barber's income at a different

18

rate than a hairdresser's and yet they may use the same

19

stuff.
MR. MILLER:

20
21

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that

-- that would -- that would be another example.
And, you know, the State has great latitude in

22
23

the taxation area and justifiably so because there are so

24

many complexities that -- that that be available to the

25

State.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Do -- do you agree, at least to the

2

extent the respondents say, that there's no other State in

3

which slot machines are taxed at a different rate

4

depending on their location, that this is unique to Iowa?
MR. MILLER:

5

I -- I think as far as I know,

6

that's -- that's the -- that's the case.

Slot machines

7

typically are not in multiple purposes -- not multiple

8

places like Iowa.

9

casinos.

Typically they're in -- they're in

So there's not -- not a lot of apt comparisons.
But you know, this is -- this is a -- a question

10
11

for the legislature.

12

fundamental right available, the legislature has -- has a

13

great deal of -- of discretion.

14

purpose of the enterprise is different.

15

development as opposed to the agricultural, for instance.

16

When that -- when that is the case, the -- the legislature

17

really has -- has a great deal -QUESTION:

18

When there's no suspect category or

And the enterprise -- the
The economic

So I push their argument or am I

19

imagining -- I'm trying to put it the strongest way.

20

Look, cosmetologists and barbers do different things, and

21

moreover an enterprise zone is a special part of the State

22

that's not exactly the same.

23

on there.

24

different is going on.

25

Something different is going

Here it's slot machine income.

MR. MILLER:

Nothing

Nothing.
Well, there is difference --

QUESTION:

I -- I -- yes, go ahead.

2

MR. MILLER:

There is difference in -- in the

3

enterprise.

and then in western Iowa along the rivers that had

9

legislature to advance a new industry, a tourism industry,

10

One has slot machines and table games.

But here you

This was -- this was

on the two rivers.
QUESTION:

11

As I understood it, didn't -- didn't

12

the tax on the -- the higher tax on the racetracks come

13

later?
MR. MILLER:

14
15
16

Honor.

It was -- it was phased in, Your

That -QUESTION:

And I can't quite understand how

17

imposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is

18

suddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.

19

MR. MILLER:

Well, the legislature, of course,

20

had the -- had the discretion to -- to have them both at

21

36 percent.

22

riverboats was that -- that they didn't go to the higher

23

rate that -- that the -- that they did for the -- for the

24

racetracks.

25

-- but they're spared that -- that higher rate and -- and

The -- the benefit of the -- to the -- to the

It's sort of a chicken and egg problem, but

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that's -- and that's an appropriate benefit.
QUESTION:

It's across-the-board rate for

3

everything that goes on at the riverboat, right?

4

20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or

5

dice, it's all 20 percent.

6

MR. MILLER:

7

QUESTION:

That's it.

The --

For the race, there's a great

8

disparity between the parimutuels.

9

5, 6 percent?

10

It's a

MR. MILLER:

It's only what, about

That's right, Your Honor.

There's

11

a -- there's a very favorable rate for the -- for the

12

racing at the -- at the racetrack.

13

sense it's a -- it's a blend of rates between the two.

14

Again, understandably so --

15

QUESTION:

So it's a -- in a

Is the rate -- is the rate for taxing

16

other gaming activities on the riverboats different from

17

the slot machines on the riverboats?

18

MR. MILLER:

No, Your Honor, it's not.

19

it's the same.

20

sort of have 20 percent there as opposed to, say, as was

21

just pointed out, 4 or 5 percent for the racing at the --

22

at the racetrack.

23
24
25

It's the same rate.

It's --

QUESTION:

So you have -- you

So it's administratively easier to

calculate if you have all one rate for the riverboat?
MR. MILLER:

It would be -- it would be more

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

easily to -- to calculate and more efficient.
QUESTION:

2

You say the riverboats, obviously,

3

are located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and

4

on the west.

5

scattered throughout the State?

6

MR. MILLER:

How about the racetracks?

Are they

They are scattered throughout the

7

State.

8

rivers.

9

Meadows, is in the Des Moines area in -- in central Iowa.

10

Two of them are on the -- turned out to be on the
But the largest one, the premier one, Prairie

QUESTION:

Add that if we looked into this at

11

any depth at all, we'd discover this originated from a

12

legislator who hated racetracks and loved riverboats and

13

was trying to kill the whole thing.

14

that besides that, there was a report of a committee that

15

said all this enterprise zone -- we don't think that's so,

16

et cetera, et cetera.

17

MR. MILLER:

And then they say

Well, I mean, shocking that -- that

18

a legislator on -- on -- in riverboat country would try

19

and help the -- help the riverboats.

20

better or worse, part of the -- part of the legislative

21

process, always was and always will be.

22

can't be sort of cops to -- to make sure that -- that they

23

-- that they do not do that.

I mean, that's, for

And -- and courts

24

QUESTION:

Well, under --

25

QUESTION:

If we ever look to the real reasons

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

for things, it would be a disaster, wouldn't it?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Well, it's, you know, the old

4

adage about sausage, making sausage, that you shouldn't

5

watch it, that -QUESTION:

6

But the Iowa -- the Iowa Supreme

7

Court seems to think it could look to what was the real

8

purpose, not the purpose that we could conceive.

9

nice purposes like the riverboat drifts away and the

10

Lots of

racetrack is -But you said something in your reply brief that

11
12

-- that really surprised me.

13

say -- if you're talking about Federal equal protection,

14

this is an area in which the leeway for the legislature is

15

the widest that there is.

16

okay, we're just doing this under Iowa equal protection,

17

and we can make that whatever we want?

18

real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.
MR. MILLER:

19

It seems to me that if we

But couldn't Iowa then say,

Yes.

And for us, the

The -- you know, the -- the

20

legislature -- the court could have said that they were

21

diverging from -- from the standards of this Court.
QUESTION:

22

But you said they couldn't do that on

23

remand.

On page 6 of your reply brief, you said that the

24

Iowa Supreme Court cannot reconsider the State court

25

decision in order to subsequently establish an adequate

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and independent State ground.
MR. MILLER:

2

Why couldn't it?

Well, our argument is -- is, Your

3

Honor -- and we know we're -- we're into sort of a little

4

bit new territory here.

5

the court has made a decision that the -- the analysis --

6

a clear decision that the analysis is the same under the

7

Federal and the State constitutional provision.

8

analysis, judged by a higher court, is determined to be

9

wrong, then that would -- would seem perhaps to settle it.

But our argument is that -- that

If that

But more significantly, the -- the respondents

10
11

didn't argue below that there was a separate analysis,

12

that -- that they should look at it separately.
QUESTION:

13

But they could.

I mean, nothing

14

would foreclose them on remand or the Iowa Supreme Court

15

itself.
MR. MILLER:

16

Yes.

It's -- it might not, but we

17

argue that -- that they sort of waived that argument, that

18

they didn't argue that in -- in the first time through,

19

that they -- it was a different analysis.

20

like everybody else, and assumed that it was the same

21

analysis.

22

QUESTION:

They conceded,

All our opinion would say, if we

23

reverse the Supreme Court of Iowa, was remand it for

24

further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

25

And so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned,

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants

2

so long as not -- as it's not inconsistent with our

3

opinion.

4
5
6
7

MR. MILLER:

Maybe I'm making my argument too soon and -- and will -QUESTION:

I doubt if you'll have any better

luck with it before the Supreme Court of Iowa.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. MILLER:

10
11

I understand, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, we -- we will -- we will try

I -- I assume.
What -- what we're saying here is that -- that

12

there are multiple legitimate State purposes available

13

that are well within the zone of Nordlinger and the

14

related cases that have been before this Court, that --

15

that this is comfortably a legitimate State interest, a

16

number of them, most specifically the development of the

17

-- of -- of the river communities.

18

consistent --

19

QUESTION:

And that's -- that's

Would it make any difference in your

20

analysis -- I don't know if this is true or not -- but if

21

the legislative history, if you had a complete record of

22

all the debates and everything else, and it was perfectly

23

clear that the hypothetical reasons you advance were

24

definitely not the reasons that motivated the particular

25

tax rates, that they did it just, say, to get even with

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the racetracks because somebody was unhappy with something

2

they had done in the past or something like that, would

3

that make any difference?
MR. MILLER:

4

Well, I -- I don't think that

5

there's -- there would be sufficient legislative history

6

to foreclose rational speculation.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

No, no.

Take his hypothetical.

QUESTION:

I'm assuming that there is, that --

There is.

10

that there's a reason out there that -- that -- none of

11

the reasons that you advance were, in fact, considered by

12

any of the legislators.

13

They thought, we really don't want to help the riverboats.

14

What we want to do is do something to really penalize the

15

racetracks because they're an immoral business, they're

16

even worse than gambling on the rivers.

17

they're doing it.

18
19
20
21
22

QUESTION:

In fact, they rejected them.

But that's why

And they put that right in the

preamble to the act.
QUESTION:

Would that make any difference in

your analysis?
MR. MILLER:

I -- I think that that kind of --

23

kind of history would not, in a rational speculation case,

24

that -- that --

25

QUESTION:

I guess my question is, is it

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rational speculation when you know it's not true?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. MILLER:

4

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I suppose not.

Well, it's usually not true.

I mean,

5

usually these things are done for the self-interest of --

6

of legislators from various districts, and -- and as long

7

as there could be a rational -- I -- I would have -- I'm

8

surprised it took you so long to answer that question.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. MILLER:

I wanted to be thoughtful, Your

11

Honor.

12

and tumble of the legislative process as -- as you

13

suggest, Your Honor, is such that the courts don't --

14

don't review that, don't -- don't --

15

But like -- we get back to -- to the -- the rough

QUESTION:

But isn't -- isn't that exactly

16

really the point?

17

unless you get to -- to some fact pattern that -- that

18

gets you a -- a higher level of scrutiny, it's not so much

19

that we're engaging in rational basis scrutiny.

20

just saying we can't touch the political process unless

21

you get yourself into a suspect class.

22

what we're saying?

23

The courts just don't review it.

MR. MILLER:

And

We're

Isn't that really

That's -- that's pretty much --

24

pretty much what's -- what's being said here and -- and

25

how the cases have been interpreted.

And is -- and it

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

makes -- makes a lot of sense because like you -- like you

2

suggest, Your Honor, when there's -- there's not a

3

fundamental right or a suspect category, that's the pure

4

legislative authority and that's where democracy kicks in

5

our -- in our country, for better or for worse, and the

6

assumption is that if they make a mistake, democracy later

7

will -- will catch that mistake.

8

Your Honor, I'd like to -- to now turn it over

9

to -- this has been my first argument, so I refer to him

10

as my safety net.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. MILLER:

Kent Jones from the Solicitor

13

General's office, and reserve what time is remaining after

14

he is done.

Mr. Jones.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

18

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

19
20
21
22

MR. JONES:

I'd like to thank counsel.

And Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Taxing decisions are like spending decisions

23

because they affect the State's economy, as well as its

24

balance sheet.

25

consistently upheld the -- the -- has consistently held

In recognizing that fact, this Court has

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that a State's desire to promote or foster one type of

2

business over another or even to promote or foster one

3

mode of doing a business over another is a rational basis

4

that supports taxing the one and exempting the other.

5

For example, in State Board v. Jackson in 1931,

6

Court in numerous contexts involving tax distinctions

between, for example, warehouses located near railroads

The rational basis -The rational basis is the Republicans

9

MR. JONES:

Well, that might explain -- the

10

difference I think between your hypothetical and -- and

11

where I'm trying to come from is that the rational basis

12

has to be related to a legitimate State purpose.

13

a -- a legitimate State purpose in fostering certain kinds

14

of commerce and suppressing others.

There's

What about -- what about slot

MR. JONES:

It's -- it's hypothetically

itself under -- under FCC v. Beach.

distinction is justifiable.

Is there a

is simply between -- is whether the State could

What -- what have we held wasn't

justified outside of a suspect category situation, such as

Well, it -- it was described by the

20

Court as -- as a rational scrutiny case, and it said there

was no legitimate State interest because in -- in the

22

context between treating differently male and female

23

surviving spouses, in light of the objective of that

24

statute, which was to protect the -- the children of the

couple, there was no rational basis to prefer one rather

answer to that is no, and I can't think of one.

MR. JONES:

And then

But is there any which is
You think the

I -- I can't think of one, but it's

18

not because there is no rational basis test.

19

in applying this test, the Court is very deferential in

recognizing that States have intentionally been given this

authority over regulating State commerce, and that these

kinds of choices are left to the legislative branch.

But in that case, the Court -- you were -- the

Court was persuaded that the distinction was invidious.

Alderson Reporting Company

case that has -- well, I don't believe there is a Federal

7

failed to meet the rational basis test.

The Court said it was

So I believe that the only tax -- Federal tax

The -- the court below made -- the Iowa Supreme
Court -- where it went wrong was looking to only one of

10

the purposes of the statute.

11

They looked to just the purpose of whether it aided

12

racetracks, which just kind of strikes me as an

13

unrealistic way to look at what the purpose of a

14

legislation that imposes a tax on racetracks would be.

15

There were many purposes.

But to answer a question that Justice Stevens

16

raised earlier, when -- in applying the rational basis

17

test, the courts are to look to any plausible or

18

conceivable theory.

19

as other cases we've cited, in applying that test, the

20

Court has said that you don't look -- you're not bound by

21

the facts of the particular case.

22

supposed to make fact findings as to what these legitimate

23

interests might be.

24

State any rational legitimate interest that the Court

25

might -- might be able to perceive and -- and nail down

And -- and in FCC v. Beach, as well

And indeed, you're not

Instead, you're supposed to allow the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that point in that case by saying that -- and I'm quoting

2

-- it is entirely irrelevant whether the conceived State

3

purpose actually motivated the State's decision.

4

So you don't have -- the State doesn't have to

5

show that these rational, legitimate State interests, in

6

fact, motivated the decision.

7

that they are, in fact, the basis for the decision because

8

this is a Federal constitutional question.

interpret the State law, we'd want to know what its

11

purpose was, but that's not this task.

12

constitutional limitation, it only -- it only takes effect

13

if the State has no conceivable or plausible legitimate

14

interest in the classification.

15

In looking at the

One other point to mention briefly is they say

16

Allegheny Pittsburgh points another direction.

Allegheny

17

Pittsburgh was the rare case that this Court said in

18

Nordlinger -- was the rare case where there was a West

19

Virginia State constitutional provision that said all

20

assessment -- all property taxes will be levied based on

21

market value.

22

that and he -- he assessed taxes based on acquisition,

23

which is prices, which is the last sale price of each

24

property, and that resulted in -- in a differential

25

treatment of each taxpayer.

A local assessor in that State didn't like

And what this Court held in

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- in Allegheny Pittsburgh was that because the State

2

constitution prohibited any taxation other than market

3

value, there was no legitimate State interest to justify

4

the -- the distinguishing tax rates.
Well, that case doesn't have any application

5
6

here because there's no provision in the Iowa constitution

7

that says that the Iowa Legislature cannot, in regulating

8

commerce, prefer or promote riverboat traffic and

9

riverboat -QUESTION:

10

Do you read Allegheny as saying that

11

the -- if the State had enacted exactly the scheme that

12

was being administered there, that it would pass equal

13

protection review?
MR. JONES:

14

It -- well, in Nordlinger, the Court

15

-- if I understand your question right, in Nordlinger, the

16

Court upheld an acquisition -- last sale price tax scheme

17

I think in California where there was no constitutional

18

provision in California that required market value

19

taxation.
QUESTION:

20

Would the answer in this case be

21

different if the Iowa Supreme Court told us that the Iowa

22

constitution requires that all slot machines be taxed

23

alike?

24
25

MR. JONES:

I think that you would make -- I

think in that -- in looking for a legitimate State

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

interest, you would make an inquiry into whether the Iowa

2

constitution prohibited preferring riverboats --

3

preferring riverboat commerce because a legitimate State

4

5

very point in response to a dissent of yours in -- in the

opinion by Justice Brennan in the Minnesota v. the Clover

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK McCORMICK

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

12
13
14

MR. McCORMICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Iowa Supreme Court in this case, as

15

this Court will determine as it reviews the opinion,

16

addressed two questions, not merely one question, in this

17

equal protection challenge.

18

The first question the court addressed is what

19

did the legislature have in mind in enacting this

20

legislation.

21

the State court was doing what State courts routinely do,

22

interpreting State law.

In doing so and in answering that question,

23

Once having determined the meaning of State law,

24

as was its prerogative, the court then moved to the second

25

question which is the only question that the State and the

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

United States have argued here, really, which is the equal

2

protection issue.
We think the first question has to be answered

3
4

before you jump to the second.

5

QUESTION:

Well, what about the -- our decision

6

in FCC v. Beach, which was just referred to earlier, where

7

it says it really doesn't make any difference what the

8

actual facts were?
MR. McCORMICK:

9

The -- the decision in Beach, as

10

I understand it, did require the establishment of a

11

legitimate State purpose under the FCC provision that was

12

at issue.

13

back to the FCC:

14

court of appeal -- or the FCC said, we can't think of a

15

better reason than was given by Judge Mikva in his

16

concurring opinion, and this Court accepted that as being

17

a plausible basis then for the distinction that was at

18

issue in that case.

19

QUESTION:

In fact, the court of appeals had sent the case
Tell us what you had in mind, and the

But we have said that any conceivable

20

rational basis is enough.

21

had in mind.

22

MR. McCORMICK:

We don't care what Iowa really

I think you do, Your Honor, and

23

I think the case that was mentioned earlier, the

24

Weinberger case, is an illustration of how it makes a

25

difference.

In that case, as the Court ultimately found,

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there was gender discrimination which was inappropriate in

2

dealing with the issue survivorship benefits as to

3

spouses, and the argument that was being proffered by the

4

Government in that case was, this is okay because this

5

statute was intended to take care of women who have

6

trouble, when they are widowed, getting by in the work

7

place.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

If you think gender discrimination

cases aren't different, you're just wrong.
MR. McCORMICK:

No, Your Honor.

I -- I am not

11

saying that the analysis was the same, but I am saying

12

that the Court looked to the actual intent as it was shown

13

by legislative history.

14

QUESTION:

Some legislatures -- some

15

legislatures don't have legislative history.

16

be done in those cases?

17

18

to find out what was the actual intent of the legislators?

19

MR. McCORMICK:

What, do you -- you convene a

What is routinely done in Iowa

20

is what we did in this case, which is -- and what courts

21

routinely do at the State level, at least what's done in

22

Iowa, is that the court looks at any available materials

23

that would bear on the concerns --

24
25

QUESTION:

There are no materials.

States don't have legislative history.

I mean, some

They just don't

keep it.

2

MR. McCORMICK:

QUESTION:

4

MR. McCORMICK:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. McCORMICK:

That's right.

What do you do in that case?
I'm telling you.

Do you call witnesses?
We don't have -- we do not have

7

records or transcripts of legislative debates at committee

8

hearings.
QUESTION:

9

So were -- were -- was testimony

10

taken from legislators asking why did you vote for this

11

bill?

12

MR. McCORMICK:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. McCORMICK:

No, Your Honor, but --

Why not?
-- affidavits -- excuse me.

But

15

affidavits were obtained that explained what the concerns

16

were that were being addressed.

17

This was a summary judgment motion in which we put in

18

information that was available to the legislature.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. McCORMICK:

We have a full record.

Affidavits from legislators?
Yes, Your Honor, but not saying

21

why they voted as they did, but explaining the legislative

22

history.

23

the meaning of State law, has accepted the kinds of

24

materials that we put in the summary judgment record.

25

And the Iowa court routinely, in dealing with

QUESTION:

Why didn't they explain why they

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

voted as they did?

2

the legislature is the criterion, why didn't you ask them,

3

why did you vote the way you did?

4

If, as you say, the -- the intent of

MR. McCORMICK:

Because Iowa, like this Court,

5

suggests that an individual legislator is incompetent to

6

say that, but Iowa, like this Court, will permit

7

legislators to explain legislative history, which is what

8

was done here.

9

affidavits.

10
11

That's what we did with these legislator

The Iowa Court used the kinds of materials

that States use when they -QUESTION:

The whole is the sum of its parts.

12

If you're really interested in why the legislature did it,

13

you ought to get affidavits from every legislator saying

14

this is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it

15

for a certain reason, that was the reason.

16

MR. McCORMICK:

In a State like Iowa, where we

17

don't have the kind of information that's available from

18

Congress, what we do is we ask our court to determine what

19

the legislature intended as it must in many, many cases,

20

including this kind of case, and offer the court the kind

21

of information, the background information that's

22

available.

23

QUESTION:

If that's how it's done in Iowa, it

24

can be done that way.

This Court, when it's dealing with

25

tax cases, it doesn't do it that way.

It doesn't look for

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the actual purpose.

2

And in -- and in the Wiesenfeld case, the whole

3

thing was driven by it being a gender classification, and

4

the Government's argument was this was pure favor to

5

women.

6

actual purpose.

And the argument is that, no, that was not the

MR. McCORMICK:

7

This Court has said in several

8

cases -- it has said in the Nordlinger case and also in

9

Heller against Doe -- that even in a rational basis case,

10

to be plausible, a justification must not be precluded by

11

the record.
And, for example, that is how Nordlinger

12
13

distinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh because Allegheny

14

Pittsburgh had determined that the West Virginia property

15

tax scheme was a market value valuation or appraisal

16

system.

17

advocated, well, this case is governed by Allegheny

18

Pittsburgh.

19

like California.

20

Pittsburgh by saying that the record in Allegheny

21

Pittsburgh precluded the legislative goal of having a

22

market value -- excuse me -- having an acquisition value

23

tax system.

24
25

And in Nordlinger, the position was being

You can't have an acquisition value system
The Court distinguished Allegheny

That's how the case was distinguished.

QUESTION:

But if you're looking at what -- what

the legislature did, they did one thing great for the

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

racetracks.

They gave them permission to have these slot

2

machines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring

3

the racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too

4

much because we're going to let you make money from these

5

slot machines, but not too much.

6

piece of it.

We're going to take a

So you like what they did, the permission to

7
8

have the slot machines, but then say, ah, but once -- they

9

have to give us as sweet a deal as they gave the

10

riverboats.

They didn't have to give you anything.

11

didn't have to let you have the slot machines.
MR. McCORMICK:

12

They

Well, Your Honor, our argument

13

about that is that they -- they threw us a lifeline when

14

we were faced with economic disaster, just as they were

15

throwing a lifeline to the riverboats, but it had an

16

anchor attached to it.

17

a 2-year moratorium before the first escalation of tax

18

occurred and they provided for a total of 10 years before

19

the 36 percent is effective.

20

year.

What they did, of course, was have

It will be effective next

21

QUESTION:

But it was -- it all came in in the

22

same legislation, didn't it --

23

MR. McCORMICK:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, Your Honor.

So they gave you something you never

had before and it was pretty good, but you didn't --

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. McCORMICK:

The Iowa Supreme Court said what

2

they did by that legislation was put us in a class the

3

same as the riverboats with respect to slot machines,

4

which was the main activity at both -- both venues, and

5

that they treated us differently by imposing this

6

draconian -QUESTION:

7

Well, then to treat you the same, I

8

think that they would have to raise the parimutuel betting

9

from 5 percent, whatever it was, to 20 percent.
MR. McCORMICK:

10

Your Honor, the record here

11

shows that parimutuel betting has invariably been a losing

12

proposition at the tracks, and the legislature, when it

13

passed this statute, specifically and expressly required

14

that the riverboats use the revenue first to pay their

15

debt, because they were in terrible circumstances, but

16

secondly to subsidize the purses at the parimutuel betting

17

and to promote the -- the horse industry.

18

these are mandated goals which were -- which the

19

legislature required.

20

QUESTION:

21

the tracks do that?

23

That the riverboats do that or that

MR. McCORMICK:

22

And such --

No.

That the racetracks do

that.

24

QUESTION:

Oh, okay.

25

MR. McCORMICK:

You said the riverboats.

I'm sorry.

I meant the

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

racetracks are required by the statute to -- to do those

2

things.

3

of net revenue in -- at least since the bankruptcy of the

4

main racetrack in 1992.

Parimutuel betting has -- has never been a source

QUESTION:

5

As I understand, the riverboats

6

wouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot

7

machines.
MR. McCORMICK:

8
9
10

Well, that's certainly arguable.

They've had them since they were initiated.

Their problem

in 1994 was getting rid of the betting and loss limits.
But the -- the Iowa court -- and it's our

11
12

contention that this was a matter that was within the

13

prerogative of the court -- in ascertaining the

14

legislative intent in this case, said it was not the

15

intent of the Iowa Legislature to benefit riverboats at

16

the expense of the racetracks.

17

QUESTION:

So how does this work?

I mean, I

18

thought there was a distinction between your trying to

19

show in a case like this that the rational purposes that

20

are advanced simply are not served -- that's a factual

21

matter.

22

the -- that this wasn't a way to bring about what they

23

claimed.

And I take it that's Allegheny.

24

MR. McCORMICK:

25

QUESTION:

They showed that

Yes.

All right.

But it's not open to you

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to show that the legislature didn't really have that

2

motive for the reason that if the courts permitted you to

3

show it, there would be no end to that.

4

arguing about legislative theories in State cases like

5

this forever.

6
7

So if that's right -- I -- I mean, you're not -I don't think you can show the first.

12

Maybe you can.

Well, our contention is that --

Yes -- is you can.

MR. McCORMICK:

-- this Court left that open to

us in Allegheny Pittsburgh.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I think it did leave it open,

13

but you see, they come in with some rational purposes, and

14

you think you've showed here that -- that they don't --

15

that this -- this particular statute could not serve those

16

purposes as a matter of the world of fact?

17

I mean, one is, for example, they say if we

18

don't have a lower rate -- you've heard it -- they'll go

19

off to some other place, and they have one that went to

20

some other place.

21

other place.

22

And you don't deny they went to some

MR. McCORMICK:

Well, the question is not only

23

legitimacy of the goal, but whether there is a rational

24

relationship and whether the classification involved is

25

reasonably related to any differential treatment.

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

As in Allegheny Pittsburgh, our complaint here

2

is a comparative one.

It's the comparative treatment for

3

the same activity essentially in the same place because

4

we've got racetracks in two of the cities that -- that are

5

the cities where two of the three riverboats were in fact,

6

and -- and on the same activity, which is what the Iowa

7

Supreme Court found when it determined that for

8

classification purposes, it saw no difference except that

9

one was a facility that was fixed and the other floated.

10

And then having -- having made that

11

determination of the equal situation, the court looked at

12

differential treatment too and said --

13

QUESTION:

14

that was part of it, isn't it?

15

rate across everything, all the kinds of games that they

16

have on the riverboat.

17

administratively convenient.

18

rate for the slot machines and another one for blackjack.

19

But there was another factor that -There was a 20 percent

So that's nice and

MR. McCORMICK:

You don't want to have one

Yes, Your Honor.

And that rate

20

was in place in 1994.

21

paid by riverboats.

22

time, because it authorized for the first time, a tax on

23

slot machine usage and activity at the racetracks.

25

QUESTION:

There wasn't any change in the tax

The legislation imposed for the first

2

premises.

And that is, now -- it had two

Number one, you said our own cases show that a

4

-- a conceivable rational basis cannot be relied upon when

5

the record indicates that in fact that was not the basis

6

for the legislation.

7

be considered as conceivable.
Number two, you said a moment ago that the Iowa

9

So fact limits what is -- what can

Supreme Court made a determination about the -- the

10

purpose of the statute, and -- and at least they

11

determined that the purpose of that statute was not to aid

12

riverboat gambling.
So I take it your argument is you can't argue

13
14

that this differential treatment is rationally related to

15

the promotion of -- of riverboat development or river

16

development because the Iowa Supreme Court has

17

definitively determined that that was not the case.

18

that a fair statement?
MR. McCORMICK:

19
20

Is

That's certainly part of our

argument, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

21

All right.

My -- my question I guess

22

is this.

There is no question that the Iowa Supreme Court

23

in the construction of the Iowa constitution can approach

24

matters that way.

25

way, then in effect we're going to have two different

If this Court approaches matters that

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

methodologies, one for Federal cases, I guess, and -- and

2

one for -- for State cases.

3

take every State case subject to fact determinations made

4

by the State courts, and that's going to limit the

5

application of this conceivable rational basis test.

6

And we're going to have to

Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to

7

keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going

8

to be bound by State court determinations of legislative

9

intent or purpose?

The State courts are perfectly free to

10

do that under their own constitutions, but when it gets to

11

us, we will not accept, for example, the determination in

12

a case like this by Iowa that the purpose was not to aid

13

riverboat gambling.

14

for us to -- to go, leaving the State courts to run their

15

systems any way they want to?

Why wouldn't that be a sensible way

MR. McCORMICK:

16

We think, Your Honor, that the

17

question of the meaning of State law has always been

18

within the domain and prerogative of -- of the State

19

courts.
QUESTION:

20

But this isn't a question of State

23

Federal -- the Equal Protection Clause.

It's a question of State fact in applying a Federal

wanted to do business in Alabama.

This Court reversed,

They were not rational.

QUESTION:

I thought that was -- involved

interstate discrimination against out-of-state actors.
MR. McCORMICK:

That was the -- that -- that was

the issue that was being reviewed on equal protection --

QUESTION:

But here you have everybody internal

25

in the same -- the same State.

So I think that's a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

different case.

2

MR. McCORMICK:

3

QUESTION:

4

Excuse me, Your Honor?

Well, you're not discriminating

against out-of-staters, which is a Federal concern.
MR. McCORMICK:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm not

6

talking about the -- the equal protection issue there.

7

I'm talking about the manner in which the record was

8

determined and the State court was given the prerogative

9

of telling this Court what it determined the purposes were

10

of the law.
QUESTION:

11

But if you're -- if you're right

about how Iowa goes about doing things, then you go back

13

and tell the Iowa court, the Supreme Court has this any

of what equal protection is and -- and that's the end of

it.

18

You have what's the real

So now say we'll apply our own State notion

MR. McCORMICK:

We're going to say that we

19

thought the -- this Court would say if the record showed,

20

whatever the record was, in this case our summary judgment

21

record, that the rational speculation by the Government is

22

not supported by the realities of the situation, then that

23

the court -- that sort of justification is not plausible.

24

We thought that's what this Court's view was.

25

We certainly will argue to the Iowa court that

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

it is within its prerogative initially first to decide

2

what the legislative purposes were, as it does in many

3

cases and as this Court has in many cases respected when

4

it is doing Federal constitutional review where the

5

meaning of a State law is a threshold issue.

then inviting the Iowa court, if this Court remands the

7

case, to reconsider the case under the Iowa constitution.

QUESTION:

We'll be

Mr. McCormick, why isn't there a

categorization problem in this case?

I mean, there is no

Iowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular.

There

is a law taxing table games at -- the revenues from that,

12

at 20 percent.

Right?

13

MR. McCORMICK:

14

QUESTION:

15

look upon these laws this way:

16

which has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the

17

table games.

18

betting plus slot machines at 5 percent for the parimutuel

19

betting and 34 percent for the slot machines.

20

Yes, Your Honor.

Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to
Iowa is taxing a business

It is taxing a business which has parimutuel

I mean, you certainly wouldn't be complaining if

21

they taxed racetracks at a combined rate of 15 percent or

22

-- or a combined rate of -- of 30 percent for that.

23

you -- you would have no complaint.

24

any difference if they simply, instead of picking one

percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34

They're taxed differently.

Well, the -- at least the view

of the Iowa court was that these two enterprises, the

QUESTION:

Your court is entitled to -- to view

it that way from State law, but they were -- they've said

that State law mirrors Federal law, and just because they

choose to look at it that way, that doesn't mean I have to

16

look at it that way.
MR. McCORMICK:

17
18

No, Your Honor.

That's --

that's certainly correct.
But in terms of the classification here, we

think that the State court was warranted in finding that

21

these two taxpayers are in the same class.

22

revenues have -- have not, from 1994 -- actually

factor in the revenues of racetracks except a negative

The table games -- that's an advantage that the

riverboats have over racetracks, not a justification for

3

differential treatment for putting a heavier tax on the

4

same activity at the racetracks.
QUESTION:

5

It's an odd position when you say

6

there was no obligation whatever for the State to allow

7

slot machines at racetracks, but if they allow it, they

8

have to be as generous to the racetrack as they were to

9

the riverboats.

What didn't come in as a discrete item

came in as part of the whole gambling operation.

strange to say not only -- once you give it to us, you

have to give us the best deal.

That's correct, Your Honor.

Iowa -- the Iowa court made the

that there is -- despite that finding on our part or that

MR. McCORMICK:

Well, what they said is the

are the same.

4

the history in Iowa, there's an old case, 1911 case, State

5

against Fairmont Creamery.

interpreting the Iowa equal protection provision never

made any reference to Federal law.

Actually part of that -- if one looks at

The Iowa court for years in

And that case, for the

decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
I believe the evolution shows and history shows

that what the court has done since then is for

convenience, because of the availability of the precedent

14

of this Court, said we use the same analysis.

15

we do the same thing in antitrust law.

We do the same

But the court is still free to arrive at a

certainly the court arrived at the decision that it did

MR. MILLER:

7

I would just point out that

8

Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Company is the -- is the

9

case where this Court decided that in -- in a case before

10

this Court that comes from a State court, that the Federal

11

process, the Federal analysis applies, and that the total

12

work, the total decisionmaking done by the State court is

13

reviewable here, so much so that in that case they

14

reversed a factual finding in -- in the court.
I would emphasize too that -- that the Iowa

15
16

Supreme Court has said that -- that the analysis is -- is

17

-- always is the same between the State provision and --

18

and the Federal provision, and has only departed, as a

19

matter of result, only one time, the Bierkamp case, in the

20

130 years that the two provisions existed at the same

21

time.

22

With that, I would respond to any questions that

you might have or -- or conclude by asking you to uphold

the constitutionality of this -- of this act because there
