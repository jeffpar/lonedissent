ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

10

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Congress has directed the FCC to use auctions to

13

allocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that

14

furthers the public interest.

15

spectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum

16

most highly and, by assumption, will use it most

17

effectively to serve the public.

18

has directed the FCC to consider a number of specific

19

factors in assessing the public interest, including

20

promoting opportunities for small business and ensuring

21

the rapid deployment of wireless services.

22

that public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of

23

section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code.

24
25

Those auctions allocate

In addition, Congress

Nothing in

To be sure, in administering its auctions the
FCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals

1

provided by the failure to meet regulatory payment

2

deadlines.

3

make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a

4

determination that continued possession of the license is

5

not in the public interest.

6

In particular, the FCC views the failure to

QUESTION:

But your point is, is that the

7

regulatory discretion and authority of the agency has been

8

replaced under the statutory scheme in large part by the

9

dynamics of the free market.

10
11

The highest bidder shows us

which is the most qualified person.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's right.

It's been

12

replaced in large part but not exclusively, and I think

13

both aspects that are important --

14

QUESTION:

Well, as to the first part, isn't the

15

Bankruptcy Code and the policy of new start and creditors

16

and so forth, isn't that really part of the free market

17

structure?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think there's a

19

difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for

20

timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it

21

implicates only the policies that are addressed by the

22

Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation

23

when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely

24

payment as a proxy for something else.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but Mr. Clement, in your

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

petition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of

2

an obtained option automatically canceled.

3

that it is indeed automatic.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

4
5

Well, it's automatic in the

sense -QUESTION:

6
7

That suggests

I mean, automatic means without any

discretion.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

8

With respect, Justice, Chief

9

Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means

10

is that it cancels without any, the need for any further

11

action from the commission, but in any given case, the

12

cancellation of a license is a result both of the

13

automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment

14

deadline has come forward, and where the commission has

15

discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you

16

can see that in this very case.

17

canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to

18

make the very first installment payment due under those

19

licenses.

20

NextWave's license is

Now, according to the licenses in the first instance,

21

that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses

22

didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in

23

its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest

24

determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18

25

months.

1

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me

2

that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed

3

a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently

4

went along with the proposals for a while to work this out

5

and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction

6

the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it.

7

doesn't sound like some automatic cancellation.

8

the FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy

9

claim for quite some time, didn't it?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That

I mean,

Well, to be sure, the FCC

11

participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected

12

its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has

13

independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we

14

point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at

15

various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy

16

that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the

17

regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I

18

think if you look at the specific event that NextWave

19

points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure

20

to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it

21

was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April

22

30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest

23

determination by the commission.

24
25

QUESTION:

You say a public interest

determination, but the only correlation that seems clear

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to me is a purely economic correlation.

2

the leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the

3

Bankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion,

4

and when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the

5

position, we want to reauction them and get the increase

6

in value.

7

decision, it was making an economic decision, not a

8

regulatory decision.

9

When the value of

It seems at each point at which the FCC made a

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Souter,

10

I don't think that's correct.

When -- I mean, it is true

11

that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a

12

creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to

13

keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7

14

billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just

15

over a billion, the result of that process would have been

16

that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would

17

have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have

18

been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better

19

way to understand this case is that the FCC does have

20

interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those

21

interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has

22

participated in those proceedings, but at the same time,

23

it has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its

24

capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that

25

would result in a sole-cause cancellation.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, suppose -- and I

2

consider this a classic case for what this provision of

3

the Bankruptcy Code was directed to.

4

State law that says anyone who is in default of traffic

5

tickets that amount to more than $500 shall have his

6

license revoked, okay, and the person in question goes

7

into bankruptcy, doesn't pay the $500, gets the $500

8

discharged in bankruptcy, the State you think can revoke

9

his license?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

10
11

No, I don't, but let me give

you -QUESTION:

12
13

Suppose you have a

Why not?

Isn't there a regulatory

purpose there?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

No.

The only regulatory

15

purpose there, at least as I understand your hypothetical,

16

is in providing for timely payment, but suppose a State -QUESTION:

17

No, the regulatory purpose is having

18

financially responsible drivers so people don't run around

19

the road hurting people and leaving them to bleed on their

20

own account.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

QUESTION:

23

There's just as much a regulatory

purpose in that hypo as there is here.
QUESTION:

24
25

Well --

purpose.

You can always find a regulatory

I mean, it's the easiest thing in the world to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

do.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

But again, but if a State had

3

a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were

4

financially responsible, and presumptively said that a

5

license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500

6

in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the

7

driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say,

8

look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets,

9

but I'm actually financially responsible.

I have a ton of

10

money in the bank, and so you ought to give me a

11

relaxation of the rules or a waiver --

12

QUESTION:

There's always such a mechanism

13

whenever you have a debtor and a creditor.

14

can always extend the payment.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

The creditor

Right, but --

You need some special power from the

State to do that?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, but again, if you look,

19

and what the regulator is doing is extending the --

20

extending the payment not as a creditor, but as a

21

regulator, I think you're in a very different situation.

22

QUESTION:

So you're just making up a regulatory

23

purpose, as a regulator.

I mean, as a regulator, as a

24

creditor you can always say it's being done as a

25

regulator, always.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I really don't think that's

2

true, with respect.

3

or opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in

4

a regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely

5

payment.

6

payment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy

7

for a public interest determination that it has this

8

waiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --

It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely

QUESTION:

9

I think the kind of waiver proceeding

That's something that I don't fully

10

grasp in your argument.

First you say, this is fully

11

automatic, this cancellation of the license.

12

pay up, license gone.

13

the time if we want to.

14

the automatic argument seems at war with the discretion

15

argument.

But then you say, but we can extend
We can use our discretion.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

You don't

Well,

Well, I mean, there is some

17

tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to

18

make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the

19

other.

20

critical in this case.

21

suspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then

22

it also provided some restructuring options that required

23

further modifications of its rules.

In its restructuring order that I think is
It froze the payments -- it

24

QUESTION:

Well --

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

When it did that --

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

When it did that, not only did

3

some people complain that they didn't give enough

4

regulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to

5

the D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily

6

and capriciously because you haven't stuck with your

7

pre-auction rules.
QUESTION:

8
9

But this doesn't sound at all like

the question presented, which says at auction,

10

automatically cancel upon the winning bidder's failure to

11

make timely payments to fulfill its winning bid.

12

when you were drafting that question, it sounds like your

13

perception of the thing was quite different than it is

14

now.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

15

It --

Well, again I think the key

16

is, the payments do cancel automatically after all the

17

efforts to get the payments extended have failed, and

18

that's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this

19

case, because in this very case -QUESTION:

20

I agree, you've said two different

21

things there.

22

whatever happened next.

23

automatically canceled after attempts to collect failed.

But you're saying it

GENERAL CLEMENT:

24
25

If it's automatic, it happened without

No, no, not after attempts

to --

1

QUESTION:

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

3

So when was the automatic trigger?
The automatic trigger is when

somebody fails to make a payment --

4

QUESTION:

All right.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Is that enough?

And -- no, it's really not

6

enough, if you look at the broader perspective of the

7

regulation, because there's an alternative way to get out

8

of the automatic cancellation.

9

regulated entity and you don't want your license to

It's not -- if you're a

10

cancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't

11

apply the automatic cancellation.

12

to the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment.

13

It's going to be due April 30.

14

to make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax

15

the payment deadline, and -QUESTION:

16
17

And you say you have the authority to

GENERAL CLEMENT:

QUESTION:

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

23
24
25

Not only does the commission

have the authority to do that --

20

22

I'm not in a good position

relax the payment date?

18
19

What you do is, you go

If that's true --- it did it in this very

case.
QUESTION:
the case today?

If that's true, why don't you settle

They say they can pay in full today.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, the reason we don't

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

settle the case today, although obviously there were

2

efforts to try to settle this, which would require

3

congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in

4

a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a

5

position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because

6

our view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has

7

passed.

The licenses have actually already -QUESTION:

8

But is the option to cure -- if you

9

wanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or

10

could you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise

11

regulation now to accept the payment?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it would be within the

13

agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this

14

point.

15

the last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm

16

sure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise

17

of discretion to relax the rules.

18

there is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules

19

demonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a

20

sole-cause cancellation.

21

Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in

QUESTION:

But the very fact that

I think -- so it is really a legal

22

issue, whether you have that discretion or not?

23

there are people who say you don't have that discretion.

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

25

QUESTION:

I mean,

Absolutely.

Well, do we have to decide that in

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this case?

I didn't realize that was one of the issues

2

presented.

That may be a more important issue than the,

3

you know, few billion dollars involved here.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well --

Right?

But I don't think -- whether

8

or not the FCC has the authority to exercise that

9

discretion in a particular case might be an issue, but

10

it's undisputed that they have that right as a general

11

matter and, in fact, NextWave wouldn't be here today if

12

the FCC didn't have the authority to offer discretionary

13

relaxation of its rules.
QUESTION:

14

When NextWave's --

Well, you might not be here, but I

15

mean, we're just assuming that it had that.

16

here.

17

frankly don't want to decide that question, because that

18

is not one of the things I've given a lot of attention to.

19

It sounds to me very, you know, at least quite arguable

20

whether they ought to have that authority.

21

The case is

That is not one of the questions presented.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

22

really think it's in dispute, because in this very case

23

the payment deadline --

24
25

QUESTION:

I agree it's not in dispute, which

means we don't have to decide it.

It's not presented in

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the case.

2

QUESTION:

-- the question.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

4

QUESTION:

Well, I --

Mr. Clement, the respondent also

5

makes a right-to-cure argument under the bankruptcy law,

6

and you haven't addressed that, I take it, in your briefs,

7

anyway.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

We think the

right-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand.

I do

10

think there are two reasons why the right to cure is not

11

any longer available to NextWave.

12

licenses automatically canceled on their own terms.

13

second reason is that the license restriction, the

14

licenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or

15

alienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals

16

with executory obligations that says that the debtor in

17

possession cannot take possession of a license, assume the

18

obligations of a license if there are restrictions on its

19

alienation or transfer.

20

QUESTION:

One is that the
The

In FCC practice, have you ever

21

revoked a license and then decided that you're going to

22

reissue it to the initial holder?

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, there have been

24

situations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block

25

license situation, but there was a situation with respect

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to a different program where a license canceled by its own

2

terms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed

3

that license largely on the basis of the fact that that

4

licensee was already providing service, and so the result

5

of revoking the license would be to deny people service

6

that was currently being provided.
Now, in the reconsideration order that's the

7
8

subject -QUESTION:

9

Well, a reconsideration order is

10

different, but a new issuance it seems to me is quite

11

questionable so far as the discretion of the agency, and I

12

think I agree with some of my colleagues, I'm not sure

13

that's before us.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

Well, I think that particular

15

instance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied

16

on that in its reconsideration proceedings before the

17

commission.

18

think demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause

19

cancellation.

20

on page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says,

21

quote, "NextWave is providing no service.

22

licensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and

23

represents licenses in 90 markets across the United

24

States."

25

And the commission, in rejecting that, I

If you look at the commission's reasoning

QUESTION:

The spectrum

But that same order repeatedly refers

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

to the automatic cancellation rule.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely, it does, and what

3

the commission decided in this order, which is under

4

review in this case, is that it was not going to relax or

5

provide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule,

6

but the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't

7

providing service, and that others stood ready to provide

8

service under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully

9

suggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation

10

is not a sole-cause cancellation.

11

It also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ARCTIC SLOPE

19

REGIONAL CORPORATION, ET AL.

20
21
22

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether section 525

23

of the Bankruptcy Code permits a bankrupt company and a

24

bankruptcy judge to override the FCC's regulatory

25

determination of the public interest and thereby allow the

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

company to retain an exclusive entitlement to use the

2

Nation's airwaves that the FCC and Congress have

3

determined is not in the public interest for it to hold.
QUESTION:

4

You refer to it as a regulatory

5

determination which, of course, assumes the whole point at

6

issue.
MR. FRANKLIN:

7

Well, I don't think it -- I think

8

that that, in fact, is undisputed as this case comes

9

before the Court, that the FCC had valid regulatory

10

reasons for taking the action it did.
QUESTION:

11
12

Then why is it phrased in terms of an

automatic cancellation rule?
MR. FRANKLIN:

13

Because the automatic

14

cancellation happened in November of 1998, but one cannot

15

look at that as a mere snapshot.

16

reasons why the FCC had that rule and the reasons why the

17

FCC had their auction -QUESTION:

18

You have to look at the

Why do you have to look at the

19

reasons?

I mean, that's what troubles me.

20

of the statute simply says that a governmental unit may

21

not revoke a charter, franchise, or other similar grant,

22

okay -- it goes on, solely because --

23

MR. FRANKLIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

The language

Right.

-- such person is or has been a

debtor, blah, blah, or hasn't made a payment.

Solely

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because.

2

MR. FRANKLIN:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, let's assume that there is a

4

Federal statute that makes discrimination because of, or

5

failure to hire someone, or let's say, let's say killing

6

someone solely because of his race --

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

-- a crime, a separate crime.

And

someone, let's assume he kills someone who is Jewish, and

10

he said, well, I didn't kill him solely because he was

11

Jewish; I killed him because I disagree with the policies

12

of Israel.

13
14

Does that get him out of the statute?

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, I'm not aware of a statute

like that, that says, solely because --

15

QUESTION:

Oh, I made it up.

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

I know that, but --

But it's important.

The section

19

525 is drafted -- is an antidiscrimination statute, but

20

it's drafted differently than other -- title VII, for

21

example, does not use the word --

22
23

QUESTION:

I'm getting to the question of

whether the fact that you have some other motive --

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- eliminates the sole causality.

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The only reason this person was killed was because he was

2

Jewish, and so also here, the only reason this license was

3

terminated is because the person hadn't paid.

4

Now, there may be some regulatory motive in the

5

background, just as in the hypothetical that I invented

6

there was some international political motive in the

7

background, but that doesn't alter the fact that the

8

person was killed solely because he was Jewish, and it

9

seems to me that the license here was revoked solely

10
11

because the payment hadn't been made.
MR. FRANKLIN:

With respect, Your Honor, the

12

term because, when it is used in antidiscrimination

13

statutes, and we have cited cases on page 3 of our reply

14

brief, is used to mean motive.

15

reason that.

16

because -- when Congress drafted section 525, it drafted

17

the statute narrowly.

18

arbitrary --

19

Because means, for the

That's what the definition of the word,

QUESTION:

It intended to prohibit

Then the statute doesn't cover

20

anything, because every regulatory body that cancels a

21

license, whenever there's a license involved, you can say

22

that there is some regulatory motive, as in the

23

hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Clement.

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

The motor vehicle cancellation.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. FRANKLIN:

I think that -- under section

2

525, the mere fact that an agency has said it has a

3

regulatory motive is not sufficient.

4

one that is not simply an arbitrary attempt to collect a

5

debt, and, Your Honors --

6

QUESTION:

It has to be a valid

Okay, can -- on that point, do you

7

agree that the statute is a response to -- the Perez case,

8

the automobile cancellation?

9
10

MR. FRANKLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

There was a regulatory motive there.

11

The regulatory motive is financially responsible drivers.

12

The benefits of that are obvious.

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

QUESTION:

Well --

So if that situation is supposed to

15

be covered by the statute, then by a parity of reasoning,

16

so would this one be.

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

But in Perez the Court examined

18

that motive and determined that looking at the statute and

19

looking at the way it operated, in fact, as the Court put

20

it, the sole emphasis of the statute was not the

21

regulatory purpose.

22

emphasis was the collection of debts.

23

QUESTION:

It was -- as the Court said, the sole

Okay, then sole emphasis and sole

24

purpose really boils down not to exclusiveness but a kind

25

of proximate or principal causation theory, and if that's

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the case, certainly here the FCC treated the debtor

2

relationship as the principal determinant of the various

3

steps that it took.

4

then when the market changed it said, forget it, we want

5

to reauction, and if it's a principal or proximate kind of

6

causation theory, I don't see how you can prevail.

7

First, it insisted on its 4 billion,

MR. FRANKLIN:

I don't think that section 525

8

embodies a causation theory in the way that Your Honor is

9

postulating.

I think that section 525 most specifically

10

speaks about which are the valid considerations that an

11

agency can look at, and in this case one needs to look at

12

the auction system that Congress established.

13

Congress intended to replace the cumbersome

14

comparative hearings and unjust lotteries of the past with

15

a new, more streamlined mechanism under which an

16

entitlement to use our airwaves, everybody's airwaves, is

17

allocated to the person that, or the company that values

18

it the most, and the way we know that is that they must

19

make good on the promises embodied in their auction bid.

20

QUESTION:

21

automatic?

22

means sometimes.

Then why doesn't automatic mean

Your brother has just explained that automatic

MR. FRANKLIN:

MR. FRANKLIN:

It means automatic without teeth.
Automatic means automatic,

although there are opportunities, as --

2

QUESTION:

Automatic except where it isn't.

3

MR. FRANKLIN:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well --

Our position in this case is

6

that the cancellation was automatic, but that it was

7

supported by valid regulatory concerns, and those

8

concerns -- I mean, the auction system mandated by

9

Congress would be completely vitiated if a bidder -- and I

10

represent people that, companies that are repeat players

11

in this game.

entitlement to use our airwaves by promising that they

13

will make a payment, and that's the reason why they're

14

selected --

15

Bidders cannot come in and obtain an

QUESTION:

Then Mr. Franklin, why didn't

16

Congress provide an exception, as it did in, for

17

perishable commodities for the Department of Agriculture?

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

19

QUESTION:

Well --

If there is this nonbankruptcy

20

overriding concern, then we have one example where

21

Congress responded to it by saying the bankruptcy

22

provision isn't going to prevail.

23

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, I -- no exception was

24

needed here.

The agriculture programs allow the Secretary

25

of Agriculture to do what the FCC may not do here, and

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is to cancel a license solely because of a failure, a

2

bankruptcy status.

3

Now, if you look at the statutes that are cited

4

in our reply brief, the agriculture statutes, they allow

5

the Secretary of Agriculture to terminate an agricultural

6

license where somebody has been discharged from

7

bankruptcy, ever in the past, or even if a partner or a

8

shareholder of a company has been discharged from

9

bankruptcy.

10

Now, the legislative history of that specific

11

exemption makes clear that Congress -- there was a debate

12

in Congress as to whether the solely because language

13

would cover that, whether there was a regulatory purpose

14

or not, and Congress felt like they didn't want to have to

15

deal with that.

16

In this case, however, it is undisputed there

17

was a valid regulatory purpose, and with respect, Justice

18

Scalia, I do not --

19

QUESTION:

Of course, nothing in the Federal

stuck holding the bag.

2

MR. FRANKLIN:

3

QUESTION:

But even in that --

So there's no regulatory necessity

4

for this whole tragedy, is there?

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

No, with respect, if one looks at

6

a cash-on-the-barrelhead system, the way the FCC auctions

7

work, and our clients are deeply involved in them, one

8

does not get the license right after becoming the high

9

bidder.

There is a period of time in which the FCC has to

10

look at various factors and people have the right to file

11

petitions to deny.

12

section 525, which prohibits an agency from denying a

13

license to anyone for failing to pay a dischargeable debt,

under their interpretation the FCC would be required to

grant a license to somebody who has been declared the high

1

NextWave made their down payment.
QUESTION:

2
3

Yes, but they didn't have any license

until they did that.
MR. FRANKLIN:

4

But what I'm saying is, even on a

5

cash-on-the-barrelhead system the FCC does not require

6

full payment, it can't require full payment until they

7

actually grant the license, and that is a several-month

8

lag between the time when you're declared the high

9

bidder -- in one case, in my client's case it was more

10

than a year after they were declared the high bidder for

11

licenses, and they actually received them, because of

12

proceedings that were filed.
QUESTION:

13

The rationale offered by the

14

commission here was that the policies of the FCC outweigh

15

the policies of the Bankruptcy Act.

16

for us to defer to the commission in making that kind of a

17

determination?

18

19

Bankruptcy Act are more important than the policies of the

I don't think that the FCC has

deference in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, but I don't

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The record is clear that the FCC revoked

19

NextWave's licenses solely because NextWave deferred a

20

payment to the FCC while reorganizing in bankruptcy. Two

21

and a half years ago the FCC blocked NextWave's bankruptcy

22

reorganization, and it did so by announcing that

23

NextWave's licenses had automatically canceled because

24

NextWave had deferred a loan payment to the FCC in 1998.

25

QUESTION:

What do you mean, had deferred it?

10

Well, because NextWave --

You didn't pay it.

MR. VERRILLI:

-- and we did not pay because we

were reorganizing, that's right.
Now, throughout the proceedings in this case the

18

FCC has never identified a ground, other than that single

19

nonpayment, that would support revocation of the licenses,

20

and that's because there isn't one.

21

instead, and what it's done here this morning, is to

22

instead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code

23

ought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public

24

interest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole

25

trigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the

interests, and section 525 of the code is a clear

expression of Congress's judgment about where the public

interest lies.

7

QUESTION:

But they say it's not automatic.

What do you say to that?
MR. VERRILLI:

I think the record utterly and

8

completely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the

9

following ways.

The regulation that they cite, which is

10

1.2110 of their rules, and it's at page 495 of the

11

appendix to the petition, says that the licenses cancel

12

automatically upon nonpayment.

13

says that the licenses cancel automatically upon

14

nonpayment and for no other reason.

The face of the license

15

The announcement of the license cancellation in

16

this case in January 2000 said that the licenses canceled

17

automatically for nonpayment and no other reason.

settlement, then there could have been some, at least,

licenses retained even though there had been the

MR. VERRILLI:

10

Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but

11

the date was suspended by the FCC well in advance.

12

payment date was suspended well in advance of its

13

occurrence, so a payment date never came and went without

14

NextWave or any other licensee failing to make a payment.

15

All that happened here was that in advance of the payment

16

date, the FCC moved the payment date, but when it did so,

it reaffirmed --

ordered a $3.7 billion reduction in the purchase price on

2

constructive broad grounds, is that right?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

4

QUESTION:

That is right, Justice O'Connor.

And if we were to affirm here, does

5

the FCC have any power to prevent a bankruptcy court from

6

reducing the price in that fashion?

MR. VERRILLI:

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

That's very strange.
Yes, it does, and it's already

10

been taken care of, in fact.

11

avoidance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is when the

12

debtor's obligation becomes due, and the issue here was

17

18

The question under the

Now, that is a matter entirely within the
All they have to do is make clear in

The reason that there was a problem here was

19

that the regulations suggested that the obligation

20

attached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset

21

declined from the time of the initial auction to the time

22

of the license award, section 544 would apply.

23

FCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is

24

unambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of

25

the auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate.

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the second circuit set

aside the bankruptcy order in that case?
MR. VERRILLI:

3

-- and it did.

It's just a

4

nonissue.

It's just -- that issue is just a nonissue, and

5

in any event it isn't -- the question really here is

6

whether the FCC, when it effectively acts as a lender, is

7

going to be treated any differently than a private company

8

when it acts as a lender.
QUESTION:

9

That is the question.

That's my

10

question.

11

least your argument's sake, it is solely because, and

12

moreover, of course this statute governs the FCC, but in

13

reading the statute, I don't see how this statute was at

14

all intended to govern the instance in which the

15

Government is acting as creditor in respect to receiving

16

payment for a good that it has sold.

17

As I read the statute, it seems to me, for at

Now, I base that on first reading the purposes

18

of this in the history, and reading the whole legislative

19

history, which will not convince some of my colleagues,

20

but nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think

21

that this is clearly about a future loan, a future

22

situation in which the future situation, the Government is

23

forbidden to discriminate against a human being because he

24

was once in bankruptcy.

balance the Government vis-a-vis the private creditor.

2

you're right in your interpretation, and I am wrong, I see

3

no way whatsoever in which the Government would have the

4

right to take a secured interest or in any other way

5

collect a debt which a human being owes it for buying a

6

license.
Now, that's my question.

7
8

If

I want to get your

response.
MR. VERRILLI:

9

My response is the following,

10

Justice Breyer.

First, the text of 525 is unambiguous.

11

It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it

12

applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those

13

that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on

14

the face of the statute that it applies and protects

15

companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts

16

are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute

17

that's -- it's not correct.

18

the statute.

It's not the right reading of

And in terms of what it does in operation, it's

19
20

this.

Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the

21

FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and

22

NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that

23

money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and

24

then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that

25

that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I'm not sure about that.

I

3

think if you accept the FCC's argument here, they would

4

say we have a regulatory purpose, because we want it -- we

5

want these licenses to be given to people who have the

6

financial responsibility to operate the radio stations and

7

so forth.

8

to that situation.
MR. VERRILLI:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

The arguments they made would continue to apply

Well --

So I wouldn't say there's no

question.

12

MR. VERRILLI:

13

QUESTION:

That's a --

I think if we accept their argument

14

here, we would probably have to accept it in the other

15

situation.

16

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think if we -- well, I

17

think that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia,

18

that the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if

19

accepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses

20

not only when the payment was not made to the Government,

21

but not made to private parties.

22

QUESTION:

So far, I'm trying to get the answer

23

to my question, and so far, in terms of my interpretation,

24

the second point you made is in terms of to the

25

applicability, if my interpretation is right.

I want to

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

know if it's right, and I only come up with one thing that

2

you've said so far, which is text, which is important --

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

-- but I learned the second year of

5

law school, I learned the second year of law school -- and

6

obviously many of my colleagues don't agree with me, but I

7

learned the second year of law school that when you have a

8

text which says "all," that there are often implied, not-

9

written exceptions.

All animals in the park.

No animals

10

in the park doesn't necessarily apply to a pet oyster,

11

okay, and so --

12

QUESTION:

Well, it's not an animal.

13

QUESTION:

Thank you.

An oyster in my course in

14

biology is an animal, all right.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

Maybe in yours it was a rock, or a

17

vegetable or a mineral.

18

and my question, of course, is that since that's how I

19

read statutes -- not everybody -- is that I find

20

exceptions implicit in statutes where to fail to read that

21

exception is to destroy the purpose of the statute, and is

22

not backed by anything in respect to what the people who

23

wrote it want.

24

MR. VERRILLI:

25

QUESTION:

But regardless, you see my point,

Well --

Now, I believe it destroys the

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

purpose of the statute because I see no way in which the

2

Government as creditor could collect the money it's owed

3

through a secured interest in what they've sold, if my

4

interpretation is wrong.

5

MR. VERRILLI:

6

QUESTION:

7

can.

No, it --

Now, I'm putting that as strong as I

I want to get a complete answer.
MR. VERRILLI:

8

Two points.

First, the

9

Government can collect its interest as a secured creditor

10

in exactly the same way a private lender could through the

11

bankruptcy system.

12

the bankruptcy system as a secured creditor.

13

it's 100 percent entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to the

14

full value of the licenses, and it has numerous other

15

protections under the code.

16

under --

17

QUESTION:

It has enormous protections through
It gets,

It can make an election

Can I stop you right there?

How does

18

it do that?

Because when it goes to enforce its secured

19

interest, I take it it's revoking the license because of

20

the money that was due it.

21

go in to enforce your secured interest in the bankruptcy

22

court, and the bankruptcy judge on the other side reads

23

525(c), 525 on your interpretation, how does he do it?

24

Because it's just like this case.

25

MR. VERRILLI:

And so how do you -- when you

They're revoking it.

You can't -- the FCC, like a

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

private lender, can't foreclose on the lien.

2

its debt has to be processed through the bankruptcy

3

system.
QUESTION:

4

Of course it should.

It has to --

That's logical.

5

My point is, how does the bankruptcy judge at that point

6

get around the language of 525, on your interpretation of

7

it, since on your interpretation of it, you would be

8

taking back the license because of failure to pay a debt.
MR. VERRILLI:

9

Right.

They can't -- under the

10

Bankruptcy Code they can't take back the license.

11

can get their secured claim paid to the same extent that a

12

private lender could, but they can't -QUESTION:

13
14

So they cannot take a secured

interest in the license?
MR. VERRILLI:

15
16

They

Yes, they can, and -- but just

as -QUESTION:

17

They don't take the license back if

18

they cause the debtor to have to sell the license and to

19

take the money from the sale of the license and give it to

20

the FCC.

21

from a cancellation of the license.

22

and the debtor can sell it to somebody else, or the

23

bankruptcy court on behalf of the debtor can sell it to

24

somebody else, is that right?

25

from the FCC?

Isn't that what's going on?

That's different

The license subsists,

Does that need approval

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. VERRILLI:

The transfer would, to somebody

2

else would need approval from the FCC, but the key point

3

here is that section 525 -QUESTION:

4

But that's different from a

5

cancellation, isn't it?

6

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, it is different from a

7

cancellation, and the key point here I think, Justice

8

Breyer, in answer to your question ultimately, is that 525

9

is in the Bankruptcy Code to protect the right to

10

reorganize.

11

Government licenses cannot be denied the ability to invoke

12

the bankruptcy process and reorganize solely because they

13

do what the Bankruptcy Code allows them to do.

14

What it says is that those who hold

Without this protection, licensing agencies would

15

have the ability to force insolvent debtors to liquidate,

16

because it would have the power to revoke their permission

17

to do business solely because they hadn't paid a debt, or

18

solely because even they were in bankruptcy, and that

19

would --

20

QUESTION:

Can the FCC -- can an FCC licensee

21

encumber the license?

22

some -- to a bank that's giving it a loan?

23

Can it pledge the license to

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, it can.

It can give it as

24

a -- it can -- the answer to that is yes.

There are some

25

restrictions on it, but the answer to that is yes, it can.

40
Alderson Reporting Company

1

If I could, I'd like to get back to the question

2

of whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and

3

the reconsideration order, which is the order under review

4

here, is the order in which the FCC says principally that

5

it departed from the automatic character of the

6

revocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer

7

than 14 times by my count that the revocation was

8

automatic, and there's one statement in that in particular

9

which I think should put to rest as a factual matter the

10

question of whether this was anything other than an

11

automatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the

12

appendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of

13

the page, before the footnote.

14

And the FCC says in the reconsideration order,

15

thus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the

16

loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation

17

it urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely

18

payment on or before the payment due date.

19

way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making

20

the payment, then there is nothing else that could have

21

been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in

22

the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that

23

would have provided an additional ground for revocation.

24
25

If the only

And if I could also point the court to a
statement on the prior page, page 73a:

For all these

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default

2

and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to

3

make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion

4

of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and

5

results in the automatic cancellation of the license

6

without further commission action.

7

Their theory is that this happens by operation

8

of law on the day after nonpayment.

It is as automatic as

9

anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration

10

process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes

11

that one iota.

12

QUESTION:

Well, at least according to this

13

presentation the FCC said that it does have discretion to

14

grant relief from the automatic cancellation.

15

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, but they said in the

16

reconsideration order that they were not going to do that,

17

ever, because it was an automatic cancellation.

18

They also said in the restructuring orders,

19

Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of

20

the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a

21

waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances,

22

and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC

23

rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those

24

provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you

25

this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the

2

licensees were providing service.

3

question that this was an automatic cancellation rule and

4

therefore precisely at the core of what section 525

5

forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from

6

doing.

7

And so there's just no

If I may, I want to turn to the question of

8

whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise

9

of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy

10

Code.

The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no

11

conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an

12

installment payment plan, and even if it were required to

13

have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress

14

didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation

15

automatic upon nonpayment.

16

is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly

17

repeals 525 in some applications, but -QUESTION:

18

So the FCC's argument really

Assuming we think there's a conflict,

19

is there any authority for the agency's assertion that it

20

has the authority to determine which statute outweighs the

21

other?

22

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, and the authority is exactly

23

contrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference.

24

The FCC deserves deference only with respect to

25

interpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Bankruptcy Code.

So the answer is clearly that they don't

2

get any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict.

3

All there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory

4

conflict.

5

FCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule,

6

and the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a

7

directive from Congress.

8

level, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is

9

that the directive from Congress prevails.

All there is, the only conflict arises from the

QUESTION:

10

When the conflict is at that

If they just simply changed their

11

rules to say the FCC "may" cancel the license in the event

12

of the nonpayment of any installment, that would be

13

enough?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. VERRILLI:

No.

No?
No, because what 525 forbids are

17

the grounds on which the license is revoked, so if the

18

license is revoked solely because of nonpayment of

19

dischargeable debt, then whether there's a rule or not --

20

QUESTION:

Oh, it isn't solely because of that.

21

That is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

FCC would be saying, we will consider the regulatory

I

10

can follow what you just said if it simply said because

12

function.

13

MR. VERRILLI:

I think it does have several

14

functions.

For example, Your Honor, the FCC has a build-

15

out rule for these licenses, says you have to build them

16

out within 5 years, and to serve, a requirement that we

17

were in compliance with, by the way.

18

been in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to

19

revoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with

20

the build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we

21

are not in compliance with the build-out rule is that

22

we're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build

23

it out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could

24

enforce its rule, even though at some level it is because

25

we were in bankruptcy.

But if we hadn't

It's just not "solely" because.

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It's because we violated a neutral rule that was not

2

focused solely on nonpayment.

3

other circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could

4

be a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a

5

broader or different set of circumstances.

And I think there would be

But when you have what you have here, is where

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

perspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a

because of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation

11

The word solely, I think, does serve a function

12

there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be

13

possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee

14

who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a

fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact

That's what the

Mr. Tribe, what do you say in

deals with a situation in which the Government agency is

not the creditor?

That's what it basically was --

MR. TRIBE:

7

Well, I -- in a way, I think that

8

that makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when

9

the agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in

10

it for the money, and one wonders here why, for example,

11

why they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to

12

private creditors?

13

that they're not reliable?

I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

The

bankruptcy court is filled with elaborate rules about when

19

you can and cannot foreclose.

20

of the estate at confirmation, and whether you're going to

21

be able to get your money back is a function of whether

you are under or oversecured.

QUESTION:

That's the part that's precisely

bothering me, my situation is no worse.
When I read the statute, it seems to me my

5

situation is worse, because if the statute applies here,

6

it applies there, and you and your colleague both tell me

7

no, that isn't so, and if you can show me it isn't so, my

8

problem disappears.

9

MR. TRIBE:

What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is

10

that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to

11

emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license,

12

but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other

13

creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an

14

appropriate piece of the pie.

15

that's the point.

16

grab the license and all the value from all the other

17

creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is

18

wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's

19

running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor

20

agency, it makes the situation worse, not better.

21

You don't get it all,

Nor does a private creditor get to

the power over this license.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper

10

concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their

11

licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the

12

commission.

13

of the cases that is being held for this case involves

14

Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan

15

that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of

16

its licenses.

17

That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one

Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the

18

licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent

19

conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address.

20

That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16

21

cents on the dollar.

22

which is to only give the FCC the value for its security

23

interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the

24

bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the

25

commission 5 cents on the dollar.

But there's a second way to do it,

1

Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern

2

with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into

3

account bankruptcy policy concerns?

4

from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited

5

on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision

6

that's under review.

7

Circuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take

8

bankruptcy policy considerations into account.

9

The authority comes

The LaRose decision is a D.C.

Now --

10

QUESTION:

It's not binding on us, certainly?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, it is binding on the

12

FCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take

13

bankruptcy considerations into account.

14

to do it properly --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Now, if it failed

But this, they're saying that they're

not going to take bankruptcy considerations into account.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, they did.

They did, and

18

again I think they -- one of the reasons they took

19

bankruptcy considerations into account is by extending

20

payments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months.

21

if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do

22

the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and

23

telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this

24

case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but

25

that's not the role of 525.

54
Alderson Reporting Company

But

1

525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that

2

simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from

3

canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not

4

true that the failure to make a payment was the sole

5

trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and

6

what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of

7

a payment that was due for a particular reason.
Now, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have

8
9

gone to the commission and tried to get a further

10

extension of that payment deadline.

They'd already gotten

11

extended 18 months.

12

further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a

13

sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is

14

supposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is

15

itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest

16

determination by the commission.

17

months but no further, based on a consideration of the

18

public interest.

They could have gotten extended even

They extended it 18

Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's

19
20

going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and

21

what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to

22

disable the Government to make installment payments?
QUESTION:

23
24
25

Exactly right.

Why didn't you argue

it?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think -- no, I

think -- I think --

(Laughter.)

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think -- there's two reasons

4

we didn't argue it.

5

in the brief, but the other reason is, you at one point

6

said, doesn't the commission just want the money?

7

actually not true.

8

back -QUESTION:

9

One, we did -- there is that flavor

That's

What we want is, we want the licenses

I know, but if they did, it's such an

10

obvious argument that I feel there's something wrong with

11

it because you didn't argue it.
