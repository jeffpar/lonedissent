ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. GERBER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Dastar discovered that an old TV show made by

12

Time Inc. was in the public domain because Fox neglected

13

to renew the copyright.

14

show at considerable expense to make it into a war

15

narrative as opposed to Eisenhower's story.

16

product did not refer to Time Inc.

17

did not refer to respondents who had their own competitive

18

video of the same TV show.

Dastar adapted the public domain

Dastar's

Dastar's product also

19

QUESTION:

Of the same what?

20

MR. GERBER:

21

Because of the latter, that is, the omission of

22

credits to respondents, and the finding that Dastar acted

23

willfully in omitting those credits, the lower court

24

awarded $1.6 million, substantially in excess of the

25

$850,000 total gross of Dastar, in order to deter it.

TV show.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

The lower courts departed from the Lanham Act in

2

a very expansionary way in our view in six separate

3

dimensions.

4

QUESTION:

Can we go back to your statement?

As

5

I -- as I understood it, it wasn't the omission of Fox,

6

but the addition of your people.

7

wasn't the failure to give credit to respondents, but it

8

was petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the

9

lower courts thought was wrong.

10

MR. GERBER:

In other words, it

Taking the lower courts in

11

ascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the

12

language is that the court finds that defendant's failure

13

to identify the television series and the book is

14

misleading to the public.

15

level, on page 3a of the petition, the language is that

16

Dastar copied, et cetera, and marketed it without

17

attribution to Fox.

18

And then at the Ninth Circuit

Neither court, Justice Ginsburg, examined

19

Dastar's credits, affirmative credits, for accuracy, for

20

whether they registered with the consumers, for

21

misleadingness or falsity in any way.

22

that the record indeed is that it was the omission of

23

credits for their competitors that was, in fact, the basis

24

for the double award.

25

QUESTION:

I would suggest

This is a failure -- this is a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

failure to attribute case then?

2

MR. GERBER:

3

Our first and most sweeping point --

4

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

But may I just point out on 3a, it --

5

the quote -- you left out the first clause I think.

6

They -- they labeled the -- the resulting product with a

7

different name and marketed it without attribution.

8

MR. GERBER:

Oh, yes.

9

changing the title of the work.

That's a reference to
The entire phrase -- and

10

pardon my truncation of it -- on page 3a is that Dastar

11

copied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series

12

created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting

13

product with a different name, and marketed it without

14

attribution.

15

Crusade in Europe, was World War II Campaigns in Europe.

16

The name Dastar put on it, instead of

And you will, I believe, see that in neither

17

opinion does either court take a look at the credits on

18

Dastar's product and conclude that they were in any way

19

misleading, nor does the court examine them at all.

20

Our first --

21

QUESTION:

Counsel, would -- would the new

22

Dastar video qualify as a derivative work that would

23

deserve copyright protection on its own?

24

MR. GERBER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

The --

And is that issue being litigated?

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GERBER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GERBER:

No, it isn't.

No.

Thank you.

Our -- our most sweeping statutory

4

point is, while not necessary for this opinion

5

certainly -- this case, certainly would dispose of it,

6

that the current version of the governing statute, Lanham

7

Act 43(a)(1)(A), does not recognize reverse passing off at

8

all.

9

under which this claim was born, were under a prior

The judicial interpretations of the Lanham Act,

10

version that was substantially amended in 1988, and while

11

no court has construed the '88 language, we think that the

12

natural and plain meaning of it is that it encompasses

13

only forward passing off.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GERBER:

16

QUESTION:

17

Only what kind of passing?
Forward passing off.

What is forward passing off?

It

sounds like a football game.

18

MR. GERBER:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. GERBER:

It's not football, Your Honor.

It is the standard type of

21

trademark or trade dress infringement in which the

22

wrongdoer -- let's call it Brand X -- utilizes the mark

23

Rolex -- of usually a well-recognized company and puts

24

that mark on its product.

25

QUESTION:

Is it some kind of affirmative

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

misrepresentation?

2

MR. GERBER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GERBER:

5

QUESTION:

6

Mm-hmm.
I -- I --

To -- to get some kind of liability

under the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.
MR. GERBER:

7
8

In forward passing off?

If I may first distinguish reverse

passing off and then come back to Your Honor's question.
QUESTION:

9

Yes.

MR. GERBER:

10

Reverse passing off, in contrast,

11

is where Brand X for some reason -- the commercial

12

motivation is often hard to discern -- gets a legitimate

13

Rolex, removes the Rolex name and puts the Brand X name on

14

it.

15

passing Rolex's goods off as its own.

Instead of passing its goods off as Rolex, it's

16

I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I --

17

QUESTION:

Well, it's -- it's related to this.

18

This is a so-called reverse passing off theory that the

19

Ninth Circuit is relying on.

20

MR. GERBER:

21

QUESTION:

Right?

Yes.

And do you say there is no such thing

22

at all or do you acknowledge that there could be some

23

Lanham Act violation if there were some kind of

24

affirmative misrepresentation?

25

MR. GERBER:

Both.

Our -- our most ambitious

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

argument is none at all, and we do have as a less

2

ambitious argument the second.

3

QUESTION:

4

urge that we -- we not take the broader view.
MR. GERBER:

5
6

QUESTION:

Right?

I don't believe so, from the

Solicitor General's brief.

7
8

Indeed, the Solicitor General would

Okay.

And let me -Well, we'll find out in a

minute.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. GERBER:

Yes.

I -- our view, which I

11

believe is shared by the Solicitor General, is that under

12

the particular statute in issue in this case, subsection

13

(a)(1)(A), reverse passing off is a no.

14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

Where -- where is that?

Let's --

let's look at the statute and talk about it.
MR. GERBER:

It's on -- it's on page 2 of the

cert petition.

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

19

MR. GERBER:

And if I may present our most

20

sweeping argument, the language in particular in (a)(1)(A)

21

requires a designation as to the origin, sponsorship, or

22

approval of Dastar's goods by another person.

23

would naturally cover the situation in which Dastar's

24

goods had the name of another person such as Fox on them,

25

but it would not cover the situation in which Dastar's

So that

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

goods had its own name on them because of the by another

2

person language.

3

and that is the normal passing off, forward passing off --

4

there is a designation that Fox sponsored Dastar's goods

5

or approved it or was the origin of it.

6

When Fox's name is on Dastar's goods --

QUESTION:

But you can --

Now, I mean, that's -- that's one

7

reading of that.

I mean, you could say -- and maybe --

8

maybe it's the more natural reading -- that as to the

9

origin by another person means that some other person

10

originated it.

But it could mean as to the origin by

11

another person, if I represent that I originated it, okay,

12

when in fact another person originated it, I would be

13

making a misrepresentation as to the origin by another

14

person because I'm denying that that other person

15

originated it.

16

misrepresentation as to the origin by another person?

I'm saying that I did.

MR. GERBER:

17

Wouldn't that be a

I don't think -- the -- the latter

18

principle that Your Honor stated I think would be correct,

19

but I would suggest that it's not illustrated by the

20

example.
I think Your Honor is perhaps looking at the as

21
22

to language here.

And in our view what that means is that

23

a representation by Dastar that Fox did sponsor Dastar's

24

work or that Fox did not sponsor Dastar's work would be

25

covered.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

Yes, either it did or did not.

Either it did or did not.
MR. GERBER:

3

But neither of -- both of those are

4

in contrast to reverse passing off in which the offending

5

party is putting its own name on the work.

6

doesn't help.

So that

And the -- the other argument -- the other

7
8

construction, which is the only competitor on the table

9

here by respondents to -QUESTION:

10
11

Well, excuse me.

Before you get

on --

12

MR. GERBER:

13

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

When -- when you put your own name on

14

it, aren't you denying that it was originated by somebody

15

else?
MR. GERBER:

16

You're not stating that it was

17

originated by another person, and that is the statutory

18

requirement.
QUESTION:

19

You're -- you're stating that it was

20

not.

You're saying that it was not originated by another

21

person.

22

being a misrepresentation as to the origin by another

23

person.

And that seems to me it could be interpreted as

24

MR. GERBER:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I --

If you put your name on it, you're

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

saying I did it.

2

a -- well --

Nobody else did it.

MR. GERBER:

3

Pardon me.

You -- you made

I -- I would rely on

4

the statutory distinction.

5

representation that the wrongdoer is the originator, with

6

whatever implications that may have, and another to make a

7

misrepresentation which -- which seems down the middle of

8

the alley of the statutory language, that another person,

9

Fox, originated the work.
QUESTION:

10

It's one thing to make a

Well, and is this affected at all by

11

the fact that the copyright had expired?

12

public domain.

13

MR. GERBER:

14

QUESTION:

Well --

Is there some -- how does that affect

Can you put your own name on something that's now in

15

it?

16

the public domain?

17

This was in the

MR. GERBER:

That, separate and apart from the

18

most sweeping argument we have, really goes to a number of

19

other attacks on what the lower court did.

20

answer is you can if it is not likely --

21

QUESTION:

The short

Mr. Gerber, I'd like to go back to

22

what the lower court did because I don't think that you

23

were accurate when you said in the view of the lower

24

court, this was a non-attribution case.

25

page 53, and the court indeed does start out by saying

I'm looking at

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that defendants failed to identify the series, but then

2

there's a semicolon, and it goes on to say --

3
4

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Where -- where is this?

At what page -- what page are we on?

5

QUESTION:

53 -- 53a of the petition.

6

I'm questioning Mr. Gerber's characterization

7

that this case is simply a non-attribution one because

8

after the semicolon, it says why that was a problem.

9

It's -- it gives the false impression that the series

10

contains only the work of those listed in the credits.

11

that was the problem that was central for the district

12

court, not simply a non-attribution, but an incorrect

13

attribution.

14

clear statement by the district court.

And I don't see how you can ignore that

MR. GERBER:

15

So

Well, in the district court, if

16

one is talking about the -- the wheat and the chaff, on

17

page 31a in which the district court introduces its

18

lengthy discussion, the statement is that the lawsuit is

19

based on defendant's distribution of a video series, which

20

plaintiffs claim is an infringement of the protected

21

material found in the book, and is an appropriation of the

22

television series, Crusade in Europe, without proper

23

credit.

24
25

Now, the reason I think that is the correct
interpretation of what the district court was doing --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Without proper credit could mean

2

improper credit, but when the court is developing that

3

point in full, it says there are two things.

4

failure to identify.

5

Lanham Act in the court's view?

6

impression that only those listed --

Why was that a violation of the

MR. GERBER:

7

Yes.

Because it gave the false

I would suggest that without

8

proper credit means what it says.

9

improper credit.

10

It doesn't mean

It means that the proper credits were

not affixed.
And then, of course, when you look at the Ninth

11
12

It was the

Circuit -- Circuit -QUESTION:

13

It was an improper attribution case,

14

not simply a non-attribution case.

15

your original characterization which I do not think pays

16

attention to what the district court, in fact, said.
MR. GERBER:

17

I'm simply questioning

I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but

18

again I would urge that without proper credit, that

19

phrase, is not a statement that there were improper

20

credits.

It's a statement that the proper credits were

21

absent.

And I would add that whatever ambiguity may lurk

22

in the district court's findings, it's quite clear that at

23

the Ninth Circuit level, which, of course, is what this

24

Court is reviewing, the case is a non-attribution case.

25

QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit had a rather quick,

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unpublished opinion --

2

MR. GERBER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GERBER:

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. GERBER:

Correct.

-- in this case.
We agree with that.

So it didn't tell us very much.

If -- if I may turn just for a

8

moment to some of the -- to the question 2, the remedies

9

issue.

Here we would urge that the statutory language and

10

legislative intent, to the extent that it is pertinent,

11

coalesce.

12

subject to the principles of equity.

13

Subject to the principles of equity, means

This Court, while the Lanham Act was being

14

debated, applied equitable principles in an intellectual

15

property case to define the circumstances under which

16

profits may be disgorged.

17

it said equitable disgorgement of profits is permissible

18

only for restitutionary purposes, only to restore to

19

plaintiff something that he has lost.

20

precludes a purely deterrent award which is not

21

restitutionary in the slightest.

22
23

That's the Sheldon case.

And

That by definition

If the Court has no further questions, I would
like to reserve my remaining time.

24

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Gerber.

25

Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5
6

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The petitioner in this case did not make any

7

false designation as to the origin of its good, a

8

videotaped series on World War II, when it put its own

9

label on that good.

Petitioner manufactured the good at

10

issue in this case, the video series.

11

it and it distributed it to consumers.

12

decisions interpreting the Lanham Act and under the Lanham

13

Act itself, petitioner is, therefore, the origin of the

14

good at issue at this case and is the source of that good

15

in the way that this Court has used that term.

16

It produced it and
Under this Court's

In 1990, Congress addressed the question of

17

artistic attribution and it addressed it in the -- in the

18

context of the copyright laws.

19

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

And it -Before you go on,

20

suppose -- suppose they hadn't edited the -- the prior

21

Crusade in Europe thing at all.

22

anything to it, didn't have a -- a new introduction,

23

didn't have the little snippets of addition that they had.

24

However, they did, indeed, make the copies and they --

25

they made the -- the plastic cassette in which it was

They had not done

inserted and so forth.
Would you take the position that -- that they

3

were the origin of that -- of that product and therefore

4

could represent that it was their product?

5

MR. GARRE:

We -- we would take that position,

6

Justice Scalia, and I think that -- that would be

7

consistent with the way this Court has consistently

8

interpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart

9

case, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring

10

decisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the

11

source of production or manufacture.

12

QUESTION:

Production not in the Hollywood sense

of production.

14

MR. GARRE:

Absolutely, and --

QUESTION:

16

this -- this physical article.

17

MR. GARRE:

Production in the sense of I made

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

And

18

that's -- of course, we encourage the intellectual

19

property laws, and this Court's decisions encourage firms

20

to go out and copy goods that come into the public domain.

In the Court's recent TrafFix case --

22

QUESTION:

23

domain, was it not?

24

MR. GARRE:

25

QUESTION:

That's what this was, in the public

That's correct.

The television --

Do you think that this Dastar product

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

could have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its

2

own?

3

MR. GARRE:

We do think that it could be

4

copyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's

5

not subject to copyright protection.

6

the original television series was subject to a copyright,

7

but that copyright expired in 1977 because respondent,

8

Twentieth Century Fox, failed to renew it.

9

if -- if the respondent had renew it, one suspects that we

Of course, the --

And of course,

10

wouldn't be here today arguing about the -- an expansive

11

interpretation of the Lanham Act.

12

Now, Congress has addressed the -- the question

13

of artistic rights of attribution.

14

context of the copyright laws, and it did so very

15

carefully.

16

artistic attribution in 1990, but it limited those rights

17

to a small class of visual arts, made them personal to the

18

author of those works, and limited the duration of the

19

life -- limited the duration of the -- the rights to the

20

life of the author.

21

It did so in the

It limited -- it recognized specific rights of

In this case, the Ninth Circuit recognized a

22

general right of artistic attribution that is not limited

23

in time, that applies to a work, an audiovisual work, that

24

Congress specifically exempted from the scope of its 1990

25

legislation and that is not personal to the author of the

work, which in this case was Time Inc. who initially

QUESTION:

3

Now, is there -- is there no -- I

understand you're saying I say I produced this, all it

means is I produced this physical object.

6

addition the person says I produced this -- this physical

object and, moreover, I -- I produced the show that is on

13

QUESTION:

Well -Is there no remedy for that?

Because

14

that's what they say occurred here.

15

mind your just saying, you know, I -- I am the maker of

16

this cassette or of this disk.

17

But -- but what happened was that on the disk it said I am

18

the artistic producer of this thing.

19

complaining about.

20

they weren't?

21

They -- they wouldn't

They wouldn't mind that.

That's what they're

Now, is there no remedy for that when

MR. GARRE:

Two responses.

First, when they

22

labeled a good that they manufactured and produced as

23

their own good, they didn't make any false designation of

24

origin within the meaning of section (a)(1)(A) of the

25

Lanham Act.

18

1

Now, as we've discussed in our brief, section

2

(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, which the respondents in this

3

case have never invoked and the courts below didn't

4

address, isn't limited to false designations of origin.

5

It applies to false designations that misrepresent the

6

nature or qualities or characteristics of a good.

7

So the second type of description that Your

8

Honor characterized conceivably could fall within the

9

scope of section (a)(1)(B), but of course section

10

(a)(1)(B) was not raised in this case and it's also

11

limited to the context of commercial advertising and

12

protection.

13

The purpose of the Lanham Act and the trademark

14

laws -- and this is made clear in the definition of

15

trademark that appears at 15 U.S.C. 1127, is to ensure

16

that firms identify and distinguish their goods in order

17

to prevent consumer confusion as to the source of goods.

18
19

QUESTION:

There isn't any general Federal

anti-lying law --

20

MR. GARRE:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. GARRE:

-- that you could get these people --

No.

There's -- there's another

24

source, Justice Scalia, and we've mentioned in note 7 of

25

our brief, the Federal Trade Commission Act gives the

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal Trade Commission authority to go out and address

2

deceptive or unfair trade practices.

3

isn't limited to false designations of origin.

4

doesn't even appear in that -- in that statute.

5

has -QUESTION:

6

But that statute too

Origin

If I -- if I just read the -- the

7

label on the videotape and it says Campaigns in Europe and

8

it's identical to Crusades in Europe, and I want to sue

9

under (B) because I've just bought something that

10

duplicated what I bought last week, does the label

11

constitute commercial advertising or promotion?
MR. GARRE:

12

We haven't addressed that issue,

13

Justice Kennedy, and -- and there is some varying case law

14

on that.

15

question in the negative.

16

18

I think most courts would probably answer that

MR. GARRE:

21

QUESTION:

Most courts have interpreted

Well, then (B) doesn't -- doesn't

Well, of course --- in the case I put, the -- the hope

22

you hold out for us under (B) isn't -- isn't very

23

promising unless you're talking about sitting and reading

24

what comes on in -- in --

25

MR. GARRE:

Of course, advertising is often --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

-- in the credits which no one ever

reads.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GARRE:

Advertising is often associated with

5

the sale of products, but more importantly, (a)(1)(A) is

6

addressed -- it's intended to ensure that consumers can

7

look at a product and identify the source of that product

8

so if they do have complaints about the product, they can

9

go to that person.

And notably, in this case, no consumer

10

who has ever purchased petitioner's videos has registered

11

any complaint along the lines that Your Honor is

12

suggesting.

13

And if --

QUESTION:

Well, I'm -- I'm supposing a case,

14

and I thought you had indicated that (B) might cover it,

15

but there has to be some advertising other than what's

16

on -- on the label.

17

MR. GARRE:

Under section (a)(1)(B), that's

18

correct, but I think that the important distinction

19

between (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(A) in this case with respect

20

to origin is that -- is that (a)(1)(A) is limited to

21

false designations of origin or as to sponsorship or

22

approval, and -- and the latter two elements, sponsorship

23

or approval, aren't addressed in -- in this case.

24

(a)(1)(B) is much broader and -- and would include the

25

types of other representations that Your Honor is

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

concerned about.
And of course, all this we think goes back to

2
3

the notion that respondents seek artistic attribution for

4

their product.
QUESTION:

5

May I -- on that score, may I go back

6

to your answer to Justice O'Connor's question about the --

7

the possibility of copyright as derivative work?

8

that copyright cover not only the new material, but all

9

the original material that they incorporated in?
MR. GARRE:

10
11

I believe that the copyright would

cover the new material.
QUESTION:

12

Would

And of course, the --

So -- so that if they -- if they did

13

that, if they got that copyright, they then couldn't turn

14

around and sue for copyright infringement when the

15

original Crusade in Europe was -- was marketed by the

16

others.

17
18

MR. GARRE:

I -- I think that's right.

We

haven't addressed that --

19

QUESTION:

Okay.

Okay.

20

MR. GARRE:

-- question in detail in our brief.

21

QUESTION:

But your -- in that case your -- your

22

understanding is that it's only the new material that

23

would be subject to copyright.

24

MR. GARRE:

25

QUESTION:

Under the derivative work.
Yes.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GARRE:

I believe that that's true.

2

But we think it's also important that when a

3

consumer buys the product in this case, a video -- a

4

package of videotapes on World War II, the consumer

5

doesn't purchase the intellectual property on those tapes.

6

And that's the purpose of the FBI warning that appears at

7

the very beginning of -- of the tape.

8

purchases a videotape series package and a copy of that

9

which it can view at home.

The consumer

Nothing in the Lanham Act,

10

which is not an artistic credit statute, required the

11

petitioner in this case to provide any attribution to the

12

true creator of the television series that petitioner

13

initially copied.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Or prevented him from -- prevented

them from making a misattribution.
MR. GARRE:

You have to add that.

Well, we -- we think that -- that's

17

true with respect to authorship because we don't think

18

authorship or -- or the concept of invention is covered by

19

(a)(1)(A).

20

And, of course, the notion of attribution that

21

respondents would urge this Court to adopt this case would

22

have to apply to other types of goods like the sign stand

23

in the TrafFix case.

24

petitioner could go out and reverse engineer and copy the

25

sign stand which had entered the public domain.

No one in TrafFix suggested that

But that

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

when it did that, it had to go and give credit to

2

Marketing Displays, the firm that initially had the -- the

3

patent on that, or to the original inventor himself,

4

Robert Sarkisian.

5

Now --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Garre, before you finish, there

7

was a reference in your brief that I didn't follow.

It

8

cropped up in another brief too, and it had -- it was a

9

reference to the Berne Convention.

Could you -- what is

10

the relevance of that international treaty to this -- to

11

this case?

12

MR. GARRE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GARRE:

May I answer that question?
Briefly.
It is relevant in that it's an

15

international convention that -- that covers copyrights,

16

but we explain our brief it -- we don't think that it

17

affects the analysis in this case because it -- as -- as

18

the Berne Convention Implementation Act states, it doesn't

19

expand or reduce existing rights under -- under domestic

20

law.

21

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Garre.

22

MR. GARRE:

23

QUESTION:

Ms. Cendali, we'll hear from you.

24

QUESTION:

It's still too high.

25

(Laughter.)

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DALE M. CENDALI

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3

MS. CENDALI:

Italians.

4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

This is not a case about copying.

It's a case

6

about deception.

No one is disputing that someone has the

7

right to copy works when they're no longer protected by

8

copyright or patent, but as this Court has long recognized

9

in decisions like Bonita Boats, Sears, and Compco, that

10

doesn't give you the right to create consumer confusion in

11

how you label such works.

12

This, I should correct, is not a case about a

13

work that's actually in the public domain.

14

Ninth Circuit decision, as we've explained in our brief,

15

we retried the work for hire issue.

16

once again affirmed her previous summary judgment decision

17

that the work was work for hire.

18

by General Eisenhower is, in fact, still protected by

19

copyright, though they intend to appeal.

20

Since the

The district court

So the underlying book

In any case, here Dastar violated the Lanham Act

21

by advertising, packaging, titling, and crediting Crusade

22

in Europe in a manner intentionally designed to give the

23

false impression that it was an original product

24

originally created by it.

25

consumer confusion was likely.

And Dastar knew, moreover, that
Norman Andersen, Dastar's

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

President, admitted that a consumer would not be happy to

2

have purchased a copy of Campaigns if he or she already

3

had a copy of Crusade.

4

QUESTION:

But the -- the issue is whether the

5

Lanham Act creates a cause of action with respect to that

6

particular unhappiness.

7

contention that the word origin in this provision simply

8

means who manufactured it, not whose -- whose idea it was?

9

What do you respond to the

And to put it in -- it applies in a patent

10

context as -- as well.

You know these -- these vise grips

11

that you can have a pliers that will hold on automatically

12

until you release it.

13

expired on that, and I produce an identical copy of -- of

14

the vise grip and I sell it and I say, you know,

15

manufactured by Scalia.

16

not my idea?

17

Suppose the patent has -- has

Do I have to say, oh, but it's

I want you to know that, you know, Mr. Vise

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. CENDALI:

I don't have to say that, do I?
Absolutely not, Your Honor, and

21

we're not urging that, but --

22

QUESTION:

And what if I say, and moreover it

23

was my original idea?

24

under the Lanham Act?

25

MS. CENDALI:

Would there be a cause of action

Yes, that would --

MS. CENDALI:

It would be.
If -- if you hold yourself out

falsely --

4

QUESTION:

Oh, my.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. CENDALI:

If you hold yourself out falsely

as the inventor of a product when you are not, that

creates liability under the Lanham Act.

have to do with -- all right.

QUESTION:

12

Act rather than Copyright Act?

13

Why?

What does -- what does that
I don't see it.

Why is it -- I mean, why is it Lanham

MS. CENDALI:

Well, the Copyright Act just deals

14

with copying, people making copies of something and

15

selling it.

16

that's what -- that's what this is.

17

they made the copies, but by crediting themselves as the

18

creator of Campaigns in Europe, they were able to jump

19

start their video business and to be able to then get all

20

the good will associated with that product and say, look,

21

we can make these videos --

22

The Lanham Act deals with deception, and

QUESTION:

No.

It's not just that

I -- I realize that, but you

23

say, well, the Copyright Act is concerned with copying.

24

It's -- it's concerned basically with -- with copying a

25

certain intellectual content.

That's what's -- that's

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

what they're trying to protect.

2

MS. CENDALI:

3

QUESTION:

That's right.

The Lanham Act, I thought, was not

4

trying to protect intellectual content.

5

to.

6

thought, wanted to make it clear -- wanted producers to

7

make it clear who is at fault if somebody buys the product

8

and doesn't like it.

9

that, is there?

There's another statute there.

It doesn't have

The Lanham Act, I

There's no deception here about

They know they're going to go to Dastar

10

and raise the devil if -- if they don't like it.

11

that the point of the Lanham Act?

12

MS. CENDALI:

No, Your Honor.

Isn't

For one thing, if

13

they don't like the content and they go to Dastar, they'll

14

have no one to talk to.
With regard to the purposes of the Lanham Act,

15
16

as this Court has made clear in Inwood and in Qualitex -QUESTION:

17

No, but they will have somebody to

18

talk to.

Dastar will say -- I'm assuming they are honest

19

people, and they will say, well, yes, we did that.

20

MS. CENDALI:

21

QUESTION:

But --

-- you don't like the fact that we

22

copied this other stuff and said it was ours?

23

ones to blame.

24
25

You --

MS. CENDALI:

We're the

But the purposes of the Lanham

Act, as this Court has made clear numerous occasions,

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

most -- very recently in Qualitex, is to let consumers be

2

able to know when they're getting a product, if they want

3

to get -- if they like it, they want to get other things

4

from that product -- from that supplier, they can.

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

QUESTION:

8

Dastar knows who to plagiarize.

When -- when I see the Dastar name,

I'm getting good stuff.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MS. CENDALI:

Well -- well, Your Honor, you just

11

don't know whether the next person they plagiarize is

12

going to be as good as Twentieth Century Fox --

13
14

QUESTION:

That's why I'm relying -- yes, but

I'm relying on them.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

They -- they knew who to copy the

17

first time.

18

guarantee that they'll know who to copy the next time, as

19

if they had made it themselves.

20

It seems to me that is just as much a -- a

MS. CENDALI:

Well, the other problem with it,

21

beyond the fact that they are deprived, because you have

22

no idea whether the next time they copy will be as good as

23

the first time, you're also depriving the consumer of the

24

ability to end up buying two of the same product, a very

25

real possibility that they would recognize.

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That's right, and they -- and they

2

can go to -- and they can go to Dastar and raise the

3

devil.

4

other thing.

5

exactly who to blame.

They said, you didn't tell us that you copied that
We'll never buy Dastar again.

MS. CENDALI:

6

But they know

They don't know who to blame

7

because if someone buys Campaigns and Crusade, they will

8

not know who cheated them.

9

The products are lodged with the Court.

They will not be able to tell.
The Court can

10

look at them.

11

one for Christmas and another one for him for his

12

birthday, he's not going to be happy to find he has

13

2 hours of the same -- two copies of the same 7-hour

14

videotape.

15

there are 7 hours of content in that.

MS. CENDALI:

22

Why can't he sue

You wouldn't know who to sue.

And

maybe he also would think -QUESTION:

20
21

But the same point.

or you sue Dastar?

from.
MS. CENDALI:

But it could have been Fox.

He

23

wouldn't have known who was the one telling the truth.

24

Moreover, he also wouldn't know -- maybe he would think,

25

you know what?

1
2

QUESTION:

Well, he can sue -- he can sue them

both and find out.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MS. CENDALI:

I don't know if that's -- that's

5

the -- the best way the law should deal with it.

Going

6

back to Justice Scalia's question, though, about origin,

7

there's nothing in the Lanham Act to suggest that Congress

8

wanted to limit the word origin to just the manufacture of

9

a product.
Now, in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in

10
11

Two Pesos, he specifically noted that the term origin has

12

expanded over time from its original roots as denoting

13

geographic origin, a concept that's now in (a)(1)(B) of

14

the Lanham Act, to encompass origin of both source and

15

manufacture.

16

is something different from manufacture.

So just by this Court's own opinion, source

What is source?

17

Going back to Justice O'Connor

18

writing for the Court in Feist, in talking about origin,

19

originator, author, the common reading of what -QUESTION:

20

Yes, but there is -- there is a sort

21

of an ambiguity or at least a debate over what the source

22

is.

23

up well in the wind -- what obligation did the -- did the

24

second manufacturer have to say the idea was somebody

25

else's?

I think your Traficante -- the -- the sign that stood

QUESTION:

3

MS. CENDALI:

Absolutely none.

Why not?

They could --

Why isn't it the same case?

It's not at all the same case.

4

But when you're -- because you're simply selling a

5

physical product -- if all Dastar did here was sell

6

Crusade in Europe as Crusade in Europe, it would be a

7

totally different case.

8

held themselves out as the maker of it, as the creator of

9

it.

10

QUESTION:

But what they did here is they

No, but they didn't hold themselves

11

out as the people who took all the pictures.

12

them were secondhand pictures, you know, taken by news

13

photographers and all sorts of people.

14

MS. CENDALI:

A lot of

They held themselves out by

15

putting their names and only their names on the credits,

16

by -- by having a special thanks to the National Archives

17

right before their names, when they admitted they had no

18

contact -- contact with the National Archives with regard

19

to creating these products, by putting only a '95

20

copyright notice on it, by -- by listing only themselves

21

as producers.

22

The only conclusion one can reach --

QUESTION:

I don't -- I don't readily see the

23

difference between that and the sign situation.

The sign

24

manufacturer wants everybody to think what a brilliant

25

builder of signs he is.

He has a lot of other models in

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

his catalog.
MS. CENDALI:

2

But the sign manufacturer -- when

3

we deal with products, we don't normally think, when you

4

have a product, that someone is saying I invented this.

5

We're accustomed to lots of people selling similar

6

products.

The commercial context is very different.
QUESTION:

7

Is what you're -- is what you're

8

saying that when you buy the books or the videotape,

9

you're buying it because you think it's going to be

10

different and you're disappointed when you find out that

11

it isn't.

12

that stands in the wind that --

With -- with TrafFix you know if it's a sign

13

MS. CENDALI:

14

QUESTION:

Well, you're right, Your Honor.

But that goes again to what I --

15

Justice Souter's initial line of questioning.

16

really think it's the major problem in the case for me.

I -- I

17

QUESTION:

Yes, and --

18

QUESTION:

What you do is you sue the seller

19

Dastar -- Dastar -- for misrepresenting.

20

MS. CENDALI:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

And -- and that Fox is not the

injured person.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

me.
MS. CENDALI:

2

-- because -- because the Lanham

3

Act does not provide a cause of action for consumers.

4

if you -- if you posit the idea that consumers need to --

5

can sue Dastar if they're disgruntled, they cannot do that

6

under the Lanham Act.

8

of action for consumers.

So

The only people then who can

There's no cause of action if a

11

of the goods?

QUESTION:

I realize.

2

QUESTION:

Well, you know, I -- I -- this just

3

totally ignores the fact that it was in the public domain.

4

I mean, of course, they had a right to copy it.

5

didn't Fox renew the copyright if they wanted to do that?

6

MS. CENDALI:

QUESTION:

8

Why

Your Honor, they had --

You wouldn't have all this trouble if

they had renewed the copyright.
MS. CENDALI:

9

There's -- there's no issue if

10

they simply copied it as Crusade in Europe and sold it as

11

Crusade in Europe.

12

Lanham Act cause of action.

13

our complaint at -- at paragraphs 12 and 22 I believe,

14

what they did was that they held themselves out as the

17

QUESTION:

Does someone have a right to go in

18

and take part of a previous work that's now in the public

19

domain and add original work to it and reissue it under

20

their name and get a derivative copyright for at least the

21

new part?

MS. CENDALI:

22
23

Now, is that authorized?
Yes, they absolutely can do

that --

QUESTION:

Yes.

this which is two courts have found it was a bodily

appropriation.

The only things they changed were to --

QUESTION:

-- the State court, we're talking

about the district court and the court of appeals in a --

5

MS. CENDALI:

6

QUESTION:

That's right.

-- a jurisdiction that has taken a

7

rather extreme view of what the Lanham Act protects.

8

That's what we're reviewing.

9

a means, it seems to me, of expanding copyright

10
11

I mean, there -- it -- it's

protection.
MS. CENDALI:

Your Honor, I -- I really don't

12

think so because, again, they could have copied.

QUESTION:

The

The problem was the

Going back to the

How does the phrase, bodily

appropriation, fit into the Lanham Act?
MS. CENDALI:

I think it's designed as a -- as a

23

tool in reverse passing off cases where you're dealing

24

with products to help assess how similar those -- those

25

products are.

To go back to --

2

QUESTION:

3

Certainly there's nothing like that

in the Lanham Act itself.
MS. CENDALI:

4

No, but -- but what it's trying to

5

do is to find a way of getting at the reverse passing off

6

problem.

7

of establishing confusion, deception, or --

8
9

The Lanham Act doesn't provide a particular way

QUESTION:

But what it -- what the Ninth Circuit

theory seems to me to do is to equate the likelihood of

10

consumer confusion with bodily appropriation.

11

in the case of the traffic sign, once there was no more

12

protection under law for that, some other manufacturer can

13

come in and sell it and produce it and that's a bodily

14

appropriation, all right, but it wasn't treated as

15

producing consumer confusion.

16

MS. CENDALI:

Now, in --

Why should this?

I don't think it -- there would be

17

liability for TrafFix under the Ninth Circuit test because

18

it's not just bodily appropriation, but it's

19

misattribution.

saying I manufactured the product, you're not

misattributing it.

be reverse passing off.

QUESTION:

What -- Ms. Cendali, how far back do

2

you go?

I mean, my problem with your interpretation of

3

the word origin -- it seems to me a very good cut-off

4

point means origin means who's selling it, who -- who

5

produced the physical thing.

6

to limit it to that.

7

what the physical thing contains if it's a -- if it's an

8

intellectual matter.

Now, you -- you don't want

You want to say it also includes

But why do you cut it off at the last copyright

10

owner?

I mean, suppose the cassette contained Carmen

11

Jones.

Okay?

12

only whoever was the author of the derivative work, Carmen

13

Jones, Harry Belafonte -- I don't know who did it.

14

I also have to identify Bizet as -- as the, you know,

15

the -- the author of the original idea, plus the unknown

16

Frenchman who wrote the novel from whom Bizet got the --

17

got the idea?
MS. CENDALI:

Why -- why -- would I have to identify not

MS. CENDALI:

24
25

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

There --

20

23

Would

Why not?
Because --

Why -- why do you arbitrarily say,

you know, you go back to the last copyright owner?
MS. CENDALI:

It has nothing to do with who is

the copyright owner or not.

It's distinct from copyright.

these cases is does the person claiming a credit for

MS. CENDALI:

Right.

So if the

person -QUESTION:

7

Okay.

But may I ask what difference

8

would it make if the person claiming the credit, instead

9

of claiming for himself, said, developed by an unknown

10

genius --

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

That would be equally misleading.

MS. CENDALI:

And would it be

I'm -- I'm sorry.

If --

The representation is not I developed

18

MS. CENDALI:

Right.

I know you developed it.

What I --

20

what I represent is it was developed by a brilliant third

party whose name I'm not going to disclose.

Would that be

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

you did.
MS. CENDALI:

But again, the issue isn't giving

3

us credit.

4

credit, them taking it --

5

The -- the danger here is them taking the

QUESTION:

Well, but what does it matter whether

6

they take the credit for themselves or -- or for Thomas

7

Edison or some third party that everybody assumes really

8

is the genius here?

9

It's false in both cases.

MS. CENDALI:

You're -- you're right.

If -- if

10

I understand what you're saying is if someone mislabels a

11

product in a false way as to what the origin of that

12

product is --

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. CENDALI:

15
16

Yes.
-- that is -- that I believe is

actionable under the Lanham Act, and I think it should be.
QUESTION:

Even you didn't have a copyright.

17

And that would apply even if you had no copyright on the

18

product, just -- just --

19

MS. CENDALI:

Copyright really has nothing to do

20

with -- with this case.

21

for separate purposes --

They're separate causes of action

Does it have to be a deliberate or

could be a mistake?

Would that also be actionable?
MS. CENDALI:

2

If it was -- if it was a mistake,

it may be false or misleading, but there wouldn't be

any -- the damage is likely to be very different if there

was a mistake.

Why wouldn't the damage be exactly

You didn't get credit for something you

MS. CENDALI:

9

But again, it's not the -- to go

10

back, Your Honor, it's not the giving us credit.

11

simply the injury lies from someone taking the credit for

12

themselves, for a company such as Dastar with no

13

experience in the video business to suddenly in 3 months,

14

at the investment of $4,000, be able to produce a 7-hour

15

video tape that it can represent to the world and use to

16

jump start its video business and sell 150 other boxed

17

sets in competition with our client.
QUESTION:

18

It's

Well, that's certainly -- it may be

19

unfair competition, but I'm not sure that it has anything

20

to do with confusion.
Let me -- may I ask you a different kind of

21
22

question?

I thought, in answer to a question I put to you

23

earlier, that you might be suggesting -- you did not come

24

out and say it, but I thought you might be suggesting that

25

there would be a different kind of analysis, depending on

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

whether we were talking about an object like the sign on

2

the two springs, on the one hand, and an object with

3

intellectual content on the other.

4

You said to me -- I -- I said, you know, they --

5

if they don't like what they get, they will know that

6

Dastar is to blame.

7

because they won't know whether Dastar copied or Fox or

8

Fox copied Dastar.

9

there is confusion and Fox will get hurt.

And your answer was, no, they won't

And therefore Fox will suffer because
And -- and that

10

seems to be a distinction based on the fact that you're

11

buying intellectual content as opposed simply to buying a

12

sign that either stays up or it doesn't stay up.

13

that an argument that -- that you would make?

14

MS. CENDALI:

Is -- is

Well, yes, in part, in the sense

15

that certainly when someone buys a creative work knowing

16

the author is important to the person.

17

Clancy novel, you'll buy another Tom Clancy novel.

18

QUESTION:

If you like a Tom

No, but I mean, that's important to

19

me, but I thought your argument was that the original

20

producer is -- is, in fact, going to be hurt by the

21

confusion because maybe the original producer will be

22

blamed for the fact that there are these two identical

23

intellectual products on the market.

24

MS. CENDALI:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's exactly right.

All right.

Now, what happens in the

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

case -- what would happen in the case in -- in which we --

2

we start out with -- with Fox marketing its -- its series

3

and they call it Crusade in Europe, just -- just as

4

they -- they labeled the original TV program, and Dastar

5

comes out with a -- with a series which is identical to

6

it, again, copyright has expired?

7

series that is identical to it and calls it War and simply

8

says at the bottom of -- of the cassette, cassette

9

manufactured by Dastar.

Dastar comes out with a

Is there a Lanham Act violation

10

then?

There is no claim that Dastar produced anything.

11

Is there a Lanham Act violation then?

12

MS. CENDALI:

There would not be a false

13

designation of origin claim under (a)(1)(A).

14

because -- because Dastar is not representing itself to be

15

the -- the creator.

16

itself -QUESTION:

17

It's --

It's accurately just simply listing

But the consumer would be just as mad

18

and -- I suppose, and there would be a danger even in the

19

second case of Fox being blamed for the identity of these

20

two products.
MS. CENDALI:

21

But there might -- there would be,

22

however, I believe in that scenario a claim under

23

(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act for falsely describing the

24

nature of the product.

25

brief --

As -- as the cases cited in our

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

QUESTION:

No, but in my second example, they

2

didn't falsely describe it.

3

produced by Dastar.

4

MS. CENDALI:

They just said, cassette

Only -- that was true from the

5

purposes of origin, and I'm saying there wouldn't be an

6

origin claim.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. CENDALI:

9

Yes.
But with regard to the title, for

the reasons discussed in the Second Circuit cases, the new

10

American Library cases, when someone comes up with a

11

creative work, and puts a title on it, inherent in that

12

use is the idea that -- that this --

13
14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

Any change in title is therefore a

deception.
MS. CENDALI:

It -- it -- that's what those

cases said, so to the -QUESTION:

It's a deception in the sense that

it's an implicit denial of the identity.

19

MS. CENDALI:

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. CENDALI:

That's right --

Yes, okay.
-- and so therefore, I think that

22

would be a separate issue.

And that's why as consumers,

23

we all know when we look at a book and we check to see,

24

you know, if it was the same Agatha Christie book

25

published under a different title.

And that's an example

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

where disclaimers are not very difficult for people to

2

deal with in -- in reality, and something that consumers

3

all can expect.

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Cendali, could you describe to us

5

precisely what it is that Dastar could represent?

6

this cassette that it's selling, and you said that they

7

can't say produced by Dastar and not say Fox.

8

exactly could they say?

9

could copy word for word what's in the public domain.

10
11

It has

What

You don't question that they
In

packaging it, what could they say?
MS. CENDALI:

Probably the easiest thing for

12

them to have done would have been to have copied it down

13

to the last iota of the frame and simply called it and

14

said, manufactured and distributed by Dastar.

15

not have been a problem under the Lanham Act or the -- or

16

the Copyright Act if -- but for the fact that the work is

17

not truly in public domain.

18

If they had want -- they could have also said,

19

new credits created by Dastar.

20

credited themselves for that.

21
22

That would

They could have accurately

They could have chosen not to credit anybody.
There's no requirement of credit.

23

Or they could have given credit to everyone.

24

They could have listed the original creditors and they

25

could have -- creators, and they could have added their

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

name on it.
All of these things they could have done which

2
3

would have protected the consumer.

4

have known what he or she was getting and also not usurped

5

for themselves unjustly in an unjust enrichment way the

6

good will to which they do not deserve.
QUESTION:

7

The consumer would

This is --

You haven't had time to address the

8

damages aspect of it, and if you're right that what went

9

wrong here was not the copying -- they were free to

10

copy --

11

MS. CENDALI:

12

QUESTION:

13

16

Then -- and the only thing that was

wrong was that they -- the attribution of creator.
MS. CENDALI:

14
15

Absolutely, Your Honor.

The misattribution, yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Why should they get the profits of

17

Dastar when -- when all they did wrong -- I mean, did --

18

copying the pages, copying the cassettes was fine.

19

seems to me to -- to have that large disgorgement of

20

damages is a misfit.

21

MS. CENDALI:

It

For several reasons, Your Honor.

22

First, the -- what they -- the disgorgement is the normal

23

remedy in cases like this because it's very difficult to

24

establish actual damages of -- of any type.

25

The statute is premised and works this way.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

You -- you establish your entitlement to profits.

2

other words, the plaintiff just simply, once they show

3

liability, needs to show what their -- that they are --

4

what the sales were, and then the burden is on Dastar to

5

come forward and establish what -- what deductions should

6

be from that.

7

argue apportionment, that only some of the sales should be

8

attributed to the infringement, for example.

10

In

Deductions have included the ability to

QUESTION:

Yes, but can I interrupt with --

with -- you got double profits in this case, didn't you?

11

MS. CENDALI:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, we did.

The court had --

And wasn't the theory of that to

13

deter new violations, which I find strange when there's an

This was the first of

You could easily have a situation where someone

would rather -- a rational, economic actor would rather

lose the profits on a particular item if -- if they can

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

get their entire stream of -- of business going forward.

This is just such a case because this was their first

5

us isn't just with regard to this product, but the injury

6

for us is the entire future diversion of sales that

7

they've been able to get by suddenly using Twentieth

8

Century Fox's work to march into the video business and

9

get profits time immemorial.

They -- they were able to use this to get instant

10

That is why Congress has enacted the kind of

11

damages provisions it has under the Lanham Act which I

12

think are singularly suited for just this type of case

13

where it's difficult to show actual damages in any given

14

way.

15

I'll note, though, that the court in our case

16

did specifically find that we did suffer actual damages

17

and they did not appeal from that.

18

is -- is clear and they're bound with it, that we lost

19

sales and that we also lost good will.

20

appealed from that.

21

any way, but the court then went on to award us profits

22

and, in her discretion, to award us double profits.

23

was using her discretion.

24

profits, but she chose in the -- in the principles of

25

equity to make a rational decision as befitting the facts

The -- the record

They have not

The court did not quantify that in

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

of this case.
And I -- she also had the opportunity, after a

2
3

damages trial, to see the demeanor in each of everyone of

4

the witnesses and to assess the credibility of their

5

various statements, and I'm sure she factored that into

6

her analysis as well.
And I think that the award should be upheld and

7
8

we hope that the Court will affirm summary judgment.

I

9

note that even though the Ninth Circuit opinion was -- was

10

short, given the fact it was a summary unpublished

11

opinion, my understanding is that this Court has de novo

12

review and has the ability, if it so chooses, to affirm

13

the district court's opinion on any fact in the record.
We think that the record amply supports the fact

QUESTION:

3

It's --

Did the disclaimer or the

4

acknowledgement have to be on the package or just in the

5

forewords -- or on the film, just in the screen credits?
MS. CENDALI:

6
7
8
9

The disclaimer -- I'm sorry, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

If -- if Dastar had done what you say

they're required to do, would it have sufficed if they put

10

the information just on the screen credits, or does it

11

have to be on the package that the consumer buys?

12

MS. CENDALI:

Well, I think it -- probably on

13

the package the consumer buys it should have said,

14

manufactured and distributed by Dastar.

15

QUESTION:

But -- and if it's not on the

package, then there's --

17

MS. CENDALI:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

And --

-- then there's a cause of action

even if it's on the screen credits?
MS. CENDALI:

No.

I think that if the

21

credits -- if our credits are on the inside and not on the

22

outside, they wouldn't need to put a disclaimer probably

23

on the -- on the outside.

In other words --

has already bought it by the -- I mean, the screen

No one -- no one looks at -Well, that -- well, that's why the

outer packaging has to be correct.

if they simply put on the outer packaging manufactured and

something different, or if they -QUESTION:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GERBER:

I have two short points.

11

Number one, Ms. Cendali contends that there is

12

no textual support in the section of the Lanham Act at

13

issue, 41(a)(1)(A), supporting our and the SG's

14

interpretation of origin and excluding the authorship

15

concept.

16

I would suggest that she's wrong.
The textual support is the word origin.

Unlike

17

the Copyright Act, which uses the word author, the Patent

18

Act, which uses the word inventor, the Lanham Act uses a

19

different word and the word is origin.

20

completely in accord with this Court's jurisprudence.

21

think perhaps as Justice Souter had suggested, the -- the

22

purpose from a policy perspective is to render efficient

23

purchasing decisions, as this Court stated in Qualitex.

24
25

MR. GERBER:

Absolutely.

Yes.

So that if I sold a cassette that I

7

physical manufactured and I advertised it as being Carmen

8

Jones, the original MGM production, and in fact it was The

9

Capitol Steps, there wouldn't be any -- there wouldn't be

10

any Lanham Act cause of action.

MR. GERBER:

off.

I think that is forward passing

I may be -QUESTION:

13

That's what I'm saying.

That's

14

forward passing off, and you would say that since origin

15

means what you say it means, I've manufactured the piece

16

of plastic, there's no -- there's no cause of action under

17

the Lanham Act.

18

MR. GERBER:

19

QUESTION:

20

Oh, excuse me.

Yes.

I mean, he who says A must say B,

right?
MR. GERBER:

21

The -- the answer under the

22

specific, myopic section we're looking at that it is

23

correct.

24
25

That would not be assertable.
It would be redressable under, arguably,

subsection (B) and we may differ from the SG with respect

Alderson Reporting Company

to commercial advertising and promotion and whether a

2

point of sale labeling qualifies.
And under a lot of consumer protection statutes

4

in the States as well as the Federal Trade Act, the -- the

5

second point that I promised responds, I believe, to

Justice O'Connor.

question yes, this would be a copyrightable derivative

8

work, the observation that the copyright defines proper

9

credits for derivative works.

I wanted to add to the answer to the

It tells owners of

10

derivative works who may be designated as the copyright

11

proprietor, and the law there is that the owner of a

12

derivative work, such as Dastar, may use its name.

respondents is a kind of dual series of credits, proper

So what we have with the suggestion of

19

to Justice Scalia's question, it can become quite

20

burdensome.

iterative product like a car, you might have 300 pages of

22

credits in the owner's manual before you even get to how

23

do you turn on the key under the alternative universe of

24

credits that is completely different from the derivative

25

work credits required by the Copyright Act.

when a product has intellectual content and there is

indeed, redound to the -- to the original -- to the

originator of the product?
