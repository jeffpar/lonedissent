ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is a case of inventive statutory

interpretation by the Ninth Circuit.

14

provision of law, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the

15

statute rather inventively as an exemption from a

16

provision of the Constitution.

17

California statutes and regulations regarding two aspects

18

of California's composition regulation of packaged fluid

19

milk, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute,

rather inventively, as an exemption for all aspects of

21

California's economic regulation of raw milk.

22

The statute at issue

The statute protects

Inventiveness may have a role to play in some

23

cases of statutory interpretation, but not when the

24

governing legal standard requires that Congress has made

its intent unmistakably clear.

The Ninth Circuit's

statutory holding should be reversed.
There is also a constitutional issue before the

Court involving the Privileges and Immunities Clause of

Article 4.

5

issue as well, but not because it was overly inventive.

6

The Ninth Circuit simply ignored, with no explanation at

7

all, binding precedent from this Court requiring that

8

courts look beyond the face of the statute to determine

9

whether, in practical effect, it draws a distinction based

The Ninth Circuit should be reversed on that

The California statutes and regulations at issue

in this case draw a distinction based on where milk is

produced, and 93 percent of dairy farmers live on their

14

farms.

15

production is, in effect, to draw a distinction based on

16

the State of residency, and the distinction should be

11

12

Why do

Congress doesn't have the power to tell

It does have the power to tell courts how to

13

construe congressional silence or inaction, and the

14

McCarran-Ferguson Act is a good example of the kind of

15

phraseology Congress uses when it wants to enact a

16

Commerce Clause exemption, but section 144 is a poor

17

candidate from the outset.

18

Number 2, the canons of construction applied in

19

numerous decisions of this Court, most recently the

20

Keffler case in February, required that a general phrase

21

like, other provision of law, be construed by reference to

22

the phrases that came before.

23

regulatory law is naturally paired with this act, but

24

would be very odd to throw the Constitution in as an

25

afterthought through use of the phrase, other provision of

Federal statutory and

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

law.
Number 3, the legislative history is devastating

2
3

to respondents' position.

The absence of a single

4

reference to the Constitution anywhere in the legislative

5

history is quite significant, but it's not the strongest

6

refutation of respondents' argument in the legislative

7

history.

8

of section 144 in the conference report describes it as,

9

10

Federal law respecting standards of identity and labeling

11

for fluid milk, close quote.

12

of the blue brief.

Rather, the very first paragraph of explanation

That can be found on page 33

Number 4, and this is merely the clincher that

13
14

builds on the first three points, the standard is whether

15

Congress has been unmistakably clear in passing a Commerce

16

Clause exemption.

way that one might call it unmistakably clear that

Congress did not pass a Commerce Clause exemption, but

QUESTION:

This argument's probably better

21

addressed to the respondents than -- than you, but do you

22

understand the respondents to argue that the percentage

23

of -- of milk solids which is one, and labeling, which is

24

the second part of the statute, simply will cease to exist

25

if -- if this pricing regulation is not upheld?

MR. ENGLERT:

No, that -- I don't understand

that to be their contention.
QUESTION:

I -- I thought that that was going to

4

be -- when I got into the case I thought, well, they're

5

going to say that it's just impossible to have the

6

labeling, but I -- I don't understand them to argue that.

7

I can ask them, of course, but --

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

I -- I don't understand them to

argue that either, Justice Kennedy.

I think the strongest

10

form their argument takes is, there is a relationship

11

between economic regulation of raw milk and compositional

12

regulation of packaged fluid milk, and any relationship is

13

enough to satisfy this statute.

14

QUESTION:

Well, is it true that the pricing and

15

pooling laws were adopted to help the milk producers

16

comply with the fluid milk content provisions?

17
18
19
20

MR. ENGLERT:

I -- I don't think that's

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. ENGLERT:

3

of the stabilization plan, that is the pricing plan, not

4

5

California's composition standards.

6
7
8

QUESTION:

And section 7254 does use the word

indirectly.
MR. ENGLERT:

It does, Your Honor, but it's very

9

interesting to look at the parallel phrasing of section

10

144 of the Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C. 7254, and the preemption

11

provision of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,

12

which is 21 U.S.C. section 343-1.

13

directly or indirectly.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ENGLERT:

Both use the phrase

Yes.
In the preemption provision of the

16

NLEA, Congress was talking about was -- what was

17

preempted, and it was saying anything a State does

18

directly or indirectly to have labeling requirements

19

different from Federal law is preempted.

20
21

What section 144 of the Farm Bill does is, it
unpreempts California's standards for milk.

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. ENGLERT:

Now, unless California is prepared

24

to say that it's entire pooling and pricing plans were

25

preempted by the NLEA in 1990, which I don't think you're

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

going to hear from Mr. Urban, the entire pooling and

2

pricing plans weren't unpreempted by section 144 of the

3

Farm Bill, either.
Let me turn to the Privileges and Immunities

4
5

Clause issue.
QUESTION:

6

Just -- just before you get there --

7

well, maybe it's a part -- does -- do Nevada producers

8

have a -- a Federal marketing order?
MR. ENGLERT:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ENGLERT:

12

QUESTION:

Nevada, yes.

And Arizona as well?
Yes.

They -- they -- do they opt out of it

13

if they want to sell the milk to -- to California

14

producers, or -MR. ENGLERT:

15

Yes.

The sales to California --

16

or, to California processors, excuse me, are not regulated

17

by those milk marketing orders.

18

buyer would both have to be within the marketing order for

19

it to be governed by the Federal milk marketing order, I

20

believe.

21

QUESTION:

The -- the seller and the

I see, and -- and so far as the

22

Nevada and Arizona dairy farmers are concerned, they can

23

sell to California without implicating any mechanisms

24

under the Federal marketing order?

25

MR. ENGLERT:

That's correct.

the Privileges and Immunities issue, right?

Now, the court below didn't deal with

MR. ENGLERT:
O'Connor.

QUESTION:

MR. ENGLERT:

7

Oh, it did actually, Justice

It did.
It affirmed the Rule 12(b)(6)

dismissal.

Okay.

MR. ENGLERT:

QUESTION:

11

MR. ENGLERT:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ENGLERT:

It's on page A14 --

Okay.
-- of the petition appendix.

All right.
And its only reasoning was, the

14

statutes and regulations do not, on their face, refer to

15

citizenship or residency.

16

absolutely precludes that reasoning is the Chalker case

17

from this Court in 1919, and respondents frankly have not

18

even made an argument for why Chalker should be overruled.

19

Our own submission is that the 84 years since Chalker was

20

decided have strengthened its underpinnings a great deal,

21

rather than undermining them.

22

The controlling precedent that

The Camden case from 1984 reinforces Chalker by

23

rejecting a formalistic approach to the threshold question

24

of discrimination, and the Lunding case from just 5 years

25

ago stresses the concern with, quote, practical effect,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

11
12
13

MS. McDOWELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 144 does not indicate with unmistakable

14

clarity that Congress meant to exempt from the Commerce

15

Clause any California laws, much less to exempt the

16

particular raw milk pooling regulations at issue here.

17

Indeed, section 144 is most naturally read as protecting

18

only a narrow set of California's fluid milk composition

19

and labeling laws from invalidation only under Federal

20

statutes and regulations, not under the Constitution.

21

First, Congress did not state or even imply that

22

the Commerce Clause is among the provisions of law from

23

which section 144 provides protection.

24

directs how those provisions of law shall be construed,

25

and Congress ordinarily does not direct this Court and the

Section 144

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

lower Federal courts how to construe the Constitution, and

2

under the canon that general words are known by their more

3

specific companions, the words, any other provision of law

4

is understood to refer to the preceding words, this act,

5

to refer only to Federal statutes and regulations

6

implementing them.

7

Section -- second, section 144 protects only

8

California laws regarding two specifically defined

9

subjects, the percentage of milk solids, and solid not --

10

solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail, and

11

the labeling of those products.

12

do not concern either subject.

13

California handlers account to the California equalization

14

pool for purchases of out-of-State raw milk which may or

15

may not ultimately be processed into fluid milk products

16

subject to the composition and labeling requirements.

17

QUESTION:

The laws challenged here
They instead concern how

Ms. McDowell, as to the exemption

18

from the National -- from the Nutrition and Labeling Act,

19

is this -- is this a special exemption that California

20

has, or do a number of States have congressional

21

exemptions from the Nutrition and Labeling Act?

22
23
24
25

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, this specific provision,

section 144, applies only to California.
QUESTION:

Yes, but are there similar exemptions

in -- in effect in other States?

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the Nutrition and Labeling

2

Act does contain an exemption for maple syrup composition

3

and labeling that might have been designed to benefit the

4

particular States where maple syrup is produced.

5

aware of the particular background of that provision.

6

I'm not

There's also an adjoining provision of the 1996

7

Farm Bill that provides further indication that Congress

8

didn't intend section 144 to apply to all of the pricing

9

and pooling laws.

That's section 143(b) on page 17 of the

10

joint appendix, which authorizes the promulgation of a

11

Federal milk marketing order for California if California

12

dairy farmers approve of one.

13

Such a Federal milk marketing order would have

14

contained its own separate Federal pricing and pooling

15

provisions.

16

California pricing and pooling provisions at issue here.

17

It seems unlikely that Congress intended in section 144 to

18

preserve the very pricing and pooling laws that section

19

143(b) and the Federal marketing order would supersede.

It would necessarily have superseded the

20

The legislative history reinforces --

21

QUESTION:

But there -- but there was no -- but

22

there is no Federal marketing order that supersedes it, or

23

am I wrong there?

24
25

MS. McDOWELL:

No, it authorized the

promulgation of one if California dairy farmers approved.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

California dairy farmers have not asked for a Federal

2

marketing order at this point.
Under a Federal marketing order, by the way,

3
4

handlers are required to treat milk from sources inside

5

and outside the marketing order, marketing area similarly,

6

so the same minimum pricing requirements that would apply

7

to a dairy farmer within the marketing area would also

8

apply if milk came in from -- from outside that area.

9

QUESTION:

Is the Federal --

10

QUESTION:

Why doesn't that resolve this case?

11

MS. McDOWELL:

Because there -- there is no

12

Federal marketing order that applies to California, and of

13

course the -QUESTION:

14

Oh, I -- I see.

In other words it

15

would have to be a California marketing order treating

16

Nevada milk, not -- not a Nevada marketing order saying

17

what happens when you go to California.
MS. McDOWELL:

18

All right.

Well, if there was a Federal milk

19

marketing order for California, milk from Nevada would be

20

treated the same as milk from California.

21

Federal milk marketing orders aren't subject to the

22

constraints of the Commerce Clause, as are the California

23

orders.

24
25

QUESTION:

Of course,

Has Congress ever provided a -- an

exemption for anything that looks like this California

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

pricing and pooling scheme?
MS. McDOWELL:

2

Not that I'm aware of, Your

3

Honor.

And this is a particularly unusual Commerce Clause

4

exemption because it does benefit only one State.

5

seems particularly appropriate in that circumstance to

6

apply the clear statement rules and -- and to require an

7

affirmative indication that Congress wanted to allow

8

California and only California to burden out-of-State

9

interests.
QUESTION:

10

I thought the only thing Congress had

11

ever -- maybe there's something else.

12

only insurance that Congress had performed the

13

extraordinary act of waiving the Commerce Clause.

14

that right?
MS. McDOWELL:

15

familiar instances of this --

19

know of.

I thought it was

That's certainly one of the most

Is there another one?
MS. McDOWELL:

There are other instances in

20

which Congress has affirmatively authorized particular

21

action by States.

involved a -- an authorization for States to essentially

23

discriminate against interstate commerce to prohibit

24

acquisitions of local banks by out-of-State holding

companies, and when Congress enacts an affirmative

5

6

understood to be Federal statutes and regulations.

Rather, it applies only to this

With respect to the Privileges and Immunities

7
8

Clause, we agree that the court of appeals erred in

9

suggesting that a statute can violate that clause only if

10

it discriminates on its face based on citizenship and --

11

or residency.

12

statute could also violate that clause if it discriminates

13

based on some factor closely related to citizenship, such

14

as the location of a person's chief business office.

15

distinction drawn by the California regulations are

16

somewhat similar.

In Chalker, the Court recognized that a

The

The lower courts didn't consider whether that

17
18

distinction is closely enough related to State citizenship

19

to implicate the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

20

Accordingly, we would ask that the judgment of the Ninth

21

Circuit be reversed with respect to both the Commerce

22

Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause question,

23

and that the case be remanded.

24

QUESTION:

25

May I ask just one just one factual

question?

MS. McDOWELL:

That's not entirely correct,

7

I believe, and perhaps the entire State of Maine is not.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. McDOWELL:

14

Of its own, yes.
-- California is the largest

economy.
QUESTION:

And my other question is, do you --

15

does the Government think we have to reach the Privilege

16

and Immunities issue to decide the case?

17

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the Court granted

18

certiorari on the Privileges and Immunities question.

19

It's a narrow question.

20

Privileges and Immunities claim may not have to be decided

21

because a ruling in petitioners' favor on the Commerce

22

Clause issue would provide them all of the relief that

23

they're seeking.

24
25

QUESTION:

Ultimately, on remand, the

And it wouldn't take care of the --

the ruling on the statute would take care of everything,

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

but not Privileges and Immunities, because that covers

2

only individual persons, not corporations.

3

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

What we're

4

saying is that the entire case needs to be remanded for

5

consideration of the Commerce Clause claim on the merits,

6

as well as the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim, and

7

if the Commerce Clause question is decided in petitioner's

8

favor, all of the petitioners would benefit from that

9

ruling, so there might not be occasion to consider the

10

Privileges and Immunities Clause as well.

Mr. Urban, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Ms. McDowell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. URBAN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

MR. URBAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are two distinct and separate inquiries in

19

construing section 7254.

First, does it create a Dormant

20

Commerce Clause exemption for any California law, and

21

second, what laws are within the scope of section 7254?

22

As regards the first step, it is unmistakably clear that

23

Congress in adopting section 7254 intended to provide a

24

Dormant Commerce Clause exemption for at least

25

California's milk content and labeling laws.

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

As regards the second step, the scope of section

2

7254 encompasses not just the milk content and labeling

3

laws themselves, but also the various means that

4

California uses to continue those laws in effect.

5

QUESTION:

How do you respond to your

6

adversary's contention that when you use the word

7

construe, Congress does not ordinarily tell this Court how

8

to construe a provision of the Constitution?

9

MR. URBAN:

First of all, in the

10

McCarran-Ferguson Act statutes the Court found that there

11

was a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.

12

they used the term construe.

13

that Congress is aware of the niceties of the difference

14

between construe and interpret --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. URBAN:

17
18

In that case

Second of all, I don't know

Well --- or it would have used both of

those words.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, looking over a large

19

group of statutes that Congress has enacted, there may be

20

something to what you say.

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

But I -- I do think the -- the word

23

construed is simply out of place when Congress is saying

24

something to this Court about how to -- how to interpret

25

the Constitution.

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. URBAN:

But beyond that, Your Honor, the --

2

they then say, construe to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise

3

limit.

4

protection of section 7254 merely to preempt, they

5

wouldn't have added two additional phrases, and in

6

addition to that, many of the preemption savings statutes

7

use the term, this act or other -- any other act of

8

Congress, or lists a set of acts or regulations.

9

don't simply have the statement of one act and then a -- a

10

If they wanted to limit the scope of the

They

general term like, any other provision of law.
QUESTION:

11

Of course, Congress is sort of at a

12

loss for words, because it -- it's only the Commerce

13

Clause -- that's the only provision of the Constitution

14

that Congress can instruct us not to apply, so it's

15

understandable.

16

body of law they -- they might use the word construe,

17

right?

18

where -- unless it was the -- the Religious Freedom

19

Restoration Act, which -- which we did not uphold.

Maybe out of respect for the rest of our

I mean, we don't have any other examples of

MR. URBAN:

20

That's -- that's correct, Your

21

Honor.

There's two ways that Congress can act to save

22

State laws.

23

the other is by a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.

24

beyond that, Congress can't affect the State exercise of

25

authority through any means that involves the

One is by a preemption savings statute, and

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

Constitution, and that, the -- the first question then is,

2

does section 7254 create a Dormant Commerce Clause

3

exemption.

4

And then, as I indicated, the choice really is,

5

is it preemption only or something more and the statute

6

itself, by using the terms, prohibit or otherwise limit,

7

suggests that it is, or states directly that it is

8

something more.

9

as a preemption savings statute they would have stopped at

10
11

If they just simply wanted to have this

preemption.
And again, the argument was raised, well, why

12

didn't they mention the Constitution directly.

None of

13

the two areas where there have been cases in which the

14

Court has found a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, one

15

of which is the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the other of

16

which is the Northeast Bancorp case, was there mention of

17

the Constitution.

18

at what the statute said, at what the context was in which

19

those statutes were adopted, and -- and from that

20

concluded that Congress had intended to fully regulate in

21

those areas or to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause

22

exemption.

They -- they looked at -- at the total,

23

The petitioners have tried to use a doctrine of

24

adjustum generis, the laws are interpreted in the company

25

they keep.

I've never seen an application of that

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

doctrine where all you have is one statute or one item

2

mentioned, and then you say any others.

3

doctrine's applied when you have three or four items.
QUESTION:

4

Usually that

Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it,

5

is not whether they -- you might construe the language as

6

broad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the

7

thing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and

8

fats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving

9

pricing legislation.

10

MR. URBAN:

That -- that's true, Your Honor.

11

That's the second inquiry, what is the scope of the

12

statute, and they are distinct inquiries, and it would be

13

possible for the Court to determine that the statute

14

doesn't cover pooling and pricing laws --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. URBAN:

Right.
-- and still protect the Dormant

17

Commerce Clause exemption from milk content and labeling

18

laws.

19
20

QUESTION:

In -- although you would not prevail

if we so held.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. URBAN:

We -- if you so held, we would be

23

back to the district court on the question of whether

24

there's a Dormant Commerce Clause violation for the milk

25

pricing and pooling laws, but the core intent of Congress

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

in enacting section 7254, which was to protect and allow

2

State milk content and labeling laws to have full effect,

3

that would be protected, because we have the Shamrock

4

Farms case from the Ninth Circuit that held that there was

5

a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption created for those

6

laws.

7

I want to --

8

QUESTION:

9

before the court in Shamrock.

10
11

I thought those laws weren't directly
I thought the fortification

provision was.
MR. URBAN:

What was directly before the Court

12

in the Shamrock case, Your Honor, was a challenge to the

13

milk content and labeling laws, and then the -- the other

14

item that was before the court that was specific was the

15

fortification allowance, which is a small part of the milk

16

pricing and pooling laws, and then there was a general

17

allegation involving milk pooling and pricing that, upon

18

which there was an admission made about the laws being --

19

I think it was something, interwoven.

20

QUESTION:

But -- but surely we're not bound by

21

Shamrock if -- if we consider it not to be sound, not to

22

have sound reasoning.

23

MR. URBAN:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor.

24

If the Court believes that there's no Dormant Commerce

25

Clause exemption at all --

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And I -- I -- and I must say, without

2

knowing many of the details of -- of the pricing scheme,

3

it seems to me that the labeling and -- and requirements

4

for fortification with, I guess, nonfat solids can exist

5

perfectly well without your pricing scheme.
MR. URBAN:

6

Your Honor, as a general matter, you

7

can have composition and labeling laws without a pricing

8

scheme.

9

because they require fortification.

California's composition standards are unique

10

features.

11

into California with complying milk.

That produces several

One is that there's not a ready market to sell

12

If you didn't have pricing and pooling laws and

13

you went back to the free market, you'd be subject to the

14

same boom-bust cycle that led to the creation of these

15

pricing and pooling laws in the first place, and when

16

you'd reached the point where the prices were very high

17

and supplies were low, I think the -- the inevitable

18

result of that would be that the composition standards

19

would be undone and they'd simply revert to the Federal

20

standards.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But -- but if that's so inevitable,

it seems to me it would have been in 7254.
MR. URBAN:

I -- I don't agree with that, Your

24

Honor, because I think that what Congress did in 7254, and

25

this goes to the scope of the statute, is that they

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

protected the composition and labeling laws themselves,

2

and they also, by using terms like, directly or

3

indirectly, establish or continue in effect, regarding

4

rather than regulating, referred to something more, and

5

that something more are the means that California uses to

6

enable the laws to continue in effect.

7

QUESTION:

That's an ingenious argument, but I

8

mean, if I understand it what you're saying is that if

9

we -- if you didn't have the price controls, then

10

competition would break out, and competition breaking out

11

would mean in -- if we were back in the thirties, that

12

eventually everybody would go out of business but for one

13

giant milk seller who then would raise the price so high

14

that the people really getting angry at him, as opposed to

15

only paying $18, which is considerably above the market

16

level, they might have to pay $24, even more.

17

They'd really get angry, and this time, though

18

they don't get angry at the $18 price, they'd start really

19

shipping milk in from Arizona, and once they shipped in

20

milk from Arizona, maybe that wouldn't have the fortified

21

stuff in it and they'd -- they'd amend the law so that you

22

could bring it in from Arizona and down would go the

23

labeling requirement as it stands today.

24
25

Do I understand the argument correctly?

I've

parodied a little, but I don't think I've parodied it that

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

much.

2

MR. URBAN:

You did, Your Honor.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. URBAN:

I did.

Yes, I did.

The -- milk is an -- is an unusual

6

commodity because it can't be stored, and like any

7

commodity, it's subject to periods, and we have this a lot

8

with agricultural pricing, where you have periods of

9

low -- you have high supply and therefore you'll have a

10

low price.

People leave the industry and then the cycle

11

will reverse, and it's when you reverse the cycle -- and

12

that's -- that is what happened with -- with milk that led

13

to the --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. URBAN:

I thought that's --- formation of those laws, and it's

16

also what occurs frequently with agricultural commodities.

17

I mean, they're -- they're subject to a boom-bust cycle,

18

and at some point in that cycle you're going to have

19

prices that are very high, and we -- we've had that happen

20

in California to some extent for other --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. URBAN:

Like --- other reasons, and -- and you --

23

and at that point, and it did happen in California in '99,

24

as we've cited in the brief, there is a lot of pressure to

25

undo the standards because they are -- they are more

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

expensive and you'll have limited supplies.

2

that's -- that's the connection.
QUESTION:

3

I mean,

May I ask, though, are the -- the

4

percentage of solids in the -- in the milk, is that

5

something -- that's something that's not determined by the

6

farmer.

7

That's determined by the processor, isn't it?
MR. URBAN:

The raw milk that comes to a -- a

8

processing plant varies to some extent in the amount of

9

fat and solids not fat.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. URBAN:

Right.
Then the processor -- this is how

12

California's processors are different from other

13

States' -- adds in solids not fat in order to meet the

14

standards, and they have -- you know, this is all

15

mechanized.

16
17

QUESTION:

And that is done even if the milk

when it left the farm was deficient in fat solids.

18

MR. URBAN:

Correct.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

Generally speaking, what percentage

21

of the raw milk comes in from out of State to California,

22

of the total?

23

MR. URBAN:

My recollection is somewhere around

24

10 to 15 percent, most of which comes to fluid milk

25

plants, which are the class 1 plants.

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

So it's generally a small percentage.

2

I'm -- I'm not sure that I think that you're dire

3

consequences scenario would play out.
Do milk prices tend to rise and fall over a wide

4
5

region of the United States at the same time, or does it

6

tend to be very spotty?
MR. URBAN:

7

California's prices rise and fall as

8

an independent market.

I don't know what happens in other

9

parts of the United States, and I want to -- aside from

10

the sort of economic theory of the boom-bust cycle, it is

11

a fact that California's own laws say that the purpose of

12

the pooling and pricing laws is to provide supply and

13

price stability in order to allow for adequate supplies of

14

fluid milk at -- at prices that are reasonable to

15

consumers, and that the purpose of -QUESTION:

16

How -- how does the latter part come

17

in?

say something if it isn't right.

This is actually a

And now the problem is, although you can say to
everybody, pay, a handler is paid $16, when they do that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

they're going to discover cheese coming in from Wisconsin,

2

and the cheesemakers are not going to be able to compete

3

and still pay $16, so they figured out in California,

4

here's how we keep our cheesemakers in business.

subsidize them.

at $14.

the milk sellers.

We

We pay them $2 because they can only sell

Where do we get the money from?

We get it from

So they pay $18 to pay the cheesemakers $14 so
that all can pay $16 to the dairies.

That way, the

10

cheesemakers stay in business despite Wisconsin, and the

11

milk sellers, unfortunately the retailers have to charge

12

more and the mothers have to pay more for their milk, but

13

that in a way helps the people who want to eat a lot of

14

cheese.

15

too much cheese, but --

We don't know what happens to them if they eat

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

But I mean, that seemed to me the essence of the

-- there we are.

19

system, and since that's the model that's in my mind, and

20

since it could become relevant, I'd like you to correct me

21

if I'm not right.
MR. URBAN:

22
23

That -- that's -- that is the wrong

model.

24

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. URBAN:

QUESTION:

3

MR. URBAN:

The -And what is the right model?
The right model is that the -- the

4

prices are generally set, and they're recalibrated

5

regularly, based on certain free market markers, like

6

various cheese exchanges, et cetera, and then there are

7

ways for each of the prices to be adjusted, the class 1,

8

class 2, class 3, class 4 prices to be adjusted so that

9

they're -- they reflect in a sense an -- a open market,

10

and there's also a desire to have these prices be

11

comparable to the prices that are being paid on the, in

12

the Federal marketing orders so that that doesn't produce

13

problems, so there's not a subsidy from one class of use

14

to another class of use.
What there was was then a blending when you come

15
16

to the producers of their revenues, and that's the pool,

17

and that blending of revenues, they adopted a two-tiered

18

system.

19

prices, and that really was set up because the

20

quota-holders had contracts and commercial dealings with

21

class 1 dealers which -- for which they got a higher

22

price, and the goal was to protect those -- those rights

23

and reflect those rights in the difference between a quota

price and an everything-else price.

One

I want to go into the legislative history of

21

section 7254, which was mentioned.

When section 7254 was

22

adopted, the Federal law NLEA preempted California milk

23

content standards, but that law only applied to fluid milk

24

in interstate commerce.

25

report which petitioners cite not only described the

The House conference committee

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

preemption issue, but it also said that the purpose of

2

adoption of 7254 was to allow California to fully enforce

3

and apply its -- its standards.
It would have made little sense, in light of

4
5

that congressional intent, for Congress to on the one hand

6

allow for a exemption from preemption but at the same time

7

allowed the exact same body of law to be subject to a

8

Dormant Commerce Clause challenge, which is, in fact, what

9

happened in the Shamrock case, yet that would occur, that

10

undermining of Congress' intent to have California be able

11

to fully enforce its own milk content standards, if

12

section 7254 were held to be only a preemption savings

13

statute.

14

We've touched on the issue of the scope of

15

section 7254, and we're not claiming that the unmistakably

16

clear standard applies to the scope, and we're certainly

17

not claiming that it's unmistakably clear that section

18

7254 applies separately to pricing and pooling laws.

19

we're claiming is that section 7254 not only covers the

20

laws themselves, but the means to keep those laws in

21

effect, and in answer to questions --

22
23

QUESTION:

Who's your authority for that, for

the extension of the unmistakably clear principle?

24

MR. URBAN:

QUESTION:

What

That it doesn't extend to -Yes.

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. URBAN:

First of all, we couldn't find a

2

single case where the Court has come back, after it's

3

determined there's a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption,

4

for example with the business of insurance, come back and

5

each time it decides what is the business of insurance,

6

that it says this is a Dormant Commerce clause exemption

7

so we have to use an unmistakably clear standard.

8
9

The Court has interpreted, after it's found a
general area of law that -- in which there's a Dormant

10

Commerce Clause exemption, that it's interpreted then what

11

is within that area of the law using standard rules of

12

statutory construction, and -- and --

13

QUESTION:

And the cases would be what,

14

Benjamin, something like that?

15

MR. URBAN:

Yes.

Yes, Prudential Insurance v.

16

Benjamin, but then when the Court's come back, for

17

example, in Royal Drug to look at what's the business of

18

insurance, they've used standard -- you've used standard

19

rules of -- of statutory construction.

20

And you know, that -- that makes a certain

21

amount of sense here, because you know, you have both a

22

preemption savings statute and a Dormant Commerce Clause

23

exemption in the same statute, which is the case -- if you

24

have a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption you'd have to

25

essentially have two sets of rules as to how you interpret

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the, what is being affected by that -- that exemption, one

2

for preemption and one for a Dormant Commerce Clause

3

exemption.

4

That -- that doesn't -- doesn't seem logical.

5

They should -- whatever Congress intended be covered by

6

the law should be interpreted the same, whether it's a

7

Commerce Clause exemption or a preemption exemption.

8
9

The second issue before the Court is the
Privileges and Immunities Clause, and when this issue was

10

considered by the Ninth Circuit they ruled that because

11

the out-of-State dairy producers were not being regulated

12

based on their residency, but that the regulatory scheme

13

involved place of production, that the -- that the

14

Privileges and Immunities Clause didn't apply.

15

That is fairly unexceptional, because the

16

purpose of the Privilege and Immunities Clause is that it

17

applies when a State law deprives a nonresident who enters

18

a State to engage in some protective privilege, that

19

they're entitled to the same privilege and immunities as a

20

resident of that State.

22

into the State to produce milk, they'd be treated exactly

the same as --

Well, do you support the Ninth

Circuit's view that to be covered by the Privileges and

Whether that is

I -- I would have thought that broad

interpreted, or would be interpreted to say that if you

5

had some transparent proxy for place of residence, like

6

they did in Chalker, that that would somehow be foreclosed

by the Ninth Circuit's decision, I think that would be a

misreading of what the Ninth Circuit did.

place of production, not on residency.
QUESTION:

11

The two sentences -- I hadn't

12

understood that.

They wrote two sentences on this in the

13

opinion, and you're saying it's really the first sentence

14

that is the holding, that there is no violation with

15

respect to the individual dairy owners because the

16

classifications the pooling plan amendments create are

17

based on the location where milk is produced, and the next

18

sentence is sort of a throw-away, and there's nothing in

19

the statute to the contrary.

MR. URBAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. URBAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.
That's how you -- I see.
In -- in summation, there -- the two

23

issues involving the section 7254 before the Court are

24

first whether it establishes an exemption and second, its

25

scope.

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

On the first issue we believe it's unmistakably

2

clear that there is an exemption established by 7254 to

3

the Dormant Commerce Clause.

4

believe that California's milk pooling and pricing laws

5

are within the scope of section 7254.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

QUESTION:

It -- it seems to me, Mr. Englert, it

13

make -- does make a certain amount of sense to say that

14

you should have one rule of construction for preemption

15

and for Dormant Commerce Clause, and you don't have two

16

different rules for interpreting congressional intent with

17

the same statute.

18

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the Court

19

has said very consistently in its Dormant Commerce Clause

20

jurisprudence that the intent of the Congress must be

21

unmistakably clear.

22

QUESTION:

Were -- were those statutes

23

preemption statutes as well?

24

preemption statute --

25

MR. ENGLERT:

You see, here you have a

In -- in some instances, they

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

were.
QUESTION:

2

-- and -- and the argument is that --

3

but let's say that it was simply a preemption case that,

4

well, directly or indirectly Congress doesn't want have to

5

spell out everything, so it says indirectly, so this -- so

6

this is not preempted.

7

Clause and you say, well, we have a different rule for

8

that.

9

Then you have a Dormant Commerce

That seems a little odd.
MR. ENGLERT:

Well, that's what the Court did in

10

New England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the

11

statute being construed, the provision of the Federal

12

Power Act being construed in that case, like the statute

13

being construed in this case, was not so much a preemption

14

clause as an unpreemption clause.

15

The typical statute that comes before this Court

16

alleged to be a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption is one

17

that says certain State laws are protected, or are

18

allowed, and in many of those cases the Court has said,

19

and New England Power v. New Hampshire is a good example,

20

the Court has often said yes, those State laws are not

21

subject to preemption under Federal law, but there is no

22

unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.

23

So the -- the Court's jurisprudence as I read it

24

is really rather consistent in setting a higher standard

25

for exemptions for the Dormant Commerce Clause, and

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a reason for that, and the reason for that is that

2

the Commerce Clause is part of the -- is one of the

3

structural provisions of the Constitution and, as this

4

Court pointed out in the South-Central Timber case, the

5

particularly strong rule of construction ensures that all

6

States know what's going on and have their say in Congress

7

before the protections the States have vis-a-vis one or

8

another -- vis-a-vis one another are altered.

9

QUESTION:

10

on privileges and immunities?

11

I -- I think it's been argued on -- on your side as if

12

what the Court had said was, well, the statute doesn't

13

create a classification on its face, doesn't create a

14

classification based on an individual's residency or

15

citizenship, which certainly it doesn't, and then you say

16

quite right, but of course a statute nonetheless could do

17

that in effect, and -- and thereby have the same violation

18

that it would have had if it had been on its face, but

19

that isn't their point, and as I reread this they're

20

saying -- I think it does say what they say it said.

21

What is the answer to the last point
I hadn't taken that in, and

What the judge was saying is, wait a minute,

22

there -- there's no -- nobody here could say they're --

23

they're discriminating on the basis of residency or

24

citizenship.

25

discriminating on the basis of where the milk is produced.

That's not what the statute says.

It's

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

We don't care if he's a California resident or a -- or an

2

Alaska resident, it's where the milk is produced, and

3

there's nothing in the statute as I read it, says the

4

judge, i.e. on its face, that says anything to the

5

contrary.

6

Now, what's the answer to that argument?

7

MR. ENGLERT:

It's all true.

It's -- it's --

8

but it was just as much of a sin for the Ninth Circuit to

9

ignore the 93 percent correlation between where dairy

10

farmers reside and where milk is produced as it was to

11

say, we don't look beyond the face of the statute.

12
13

QUESTION:

I see, you're saying it might violate

the Privileges and Immunities Clause even if -- or, why?

14

MR. ENGLERT:

15

QUESTION:

It's -- it's exactly --

The -- what -- it's a violation of

16

the Privileges and Immunities Clause for a State to

17

discriminate against out-of-State commerce, because after

18

all, out-of-State commerce is mostly produced by

19

out-of-State residents?

20
21

MR. ENGLERT:

I -- I'm not making that broad an

argument, Justice Breyer.

22

QUESTION:

Then what is --

23

MR. ENGLERT:

I'm saying that in this case, as

24

in the Chalker case, there is an extremely high

25

correlation between place of business and residency or

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

citizenship of individuals, and just as this Court said,

2

we don't care that someone from Alabama could have a

3

principal place of business in Tennessee, because most

4

people from Alabama don't have a principal place of

5

business in Tennessee --

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. ENGLERT:

-- so too, here, the Ninth Circuit

8

should not have cared that Nevadans could have -- could

9

produce milk in California when 93 percent of all dairy

10

farmers do produce milk in the State and, indeed, on the

11

very farm where they reside.

12

QUESTION:

So if Massachusetts passes a

13

statute -- you know this area better than I at the moment,

14

but if Massachusetts passes a statute and it says, we're

15

fed up with nectarines from California, they're too

16

woolly, and therefore no more nectarines from California

17

coming into Massachusetts, it's absolutely true, every

18

nectarine farm down there is owned by a California

19

resident, none by Massachusetts residents.

20

the Privileges and Immunities provision, in your opinion,

21

as far as individuals own the farms?

22

MR. ENGLERT:

That violates

I -- I certainly suspect it's a

23

violation, but we're we're not asking this Court actually

24

to hold that there's any --

No, no, I know that.

QUESTION:

24

MR. ENGLERT:

25

Yes, I -- I understand.
-- exemption, and with respect to

the Privileges and Immunities Clause on the ground that

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

location is not the same as residency or citizenship, and

2

we need not look behind location of production to ask

3

whether it is so closely correlated with residency or

4

citizenship as to create an improper -- a classification

5

that must be scrutinized under the Constitution.

6

Mr. Urban pointed out that the McCarran-Ferguson

7

Act uses the verb construe, and rightly so, but what it

8

says the Court is not to construe as forbidding State

9

regulation is Congress' silence.

It is not a directive

10

how to construe the Constitution.

It is a very proper

11

statute, perhaps the model for how a Dormant Commerce

12

Clause exemption should be written.

13

silence to mean we want to stop the States from doing

14

something.

15

statute here says, construe this act or any other

16

provision of law in particular ways.

Don't construe our

The statute here is very different.

The

17

Mr. Urban, in talking about section 7254, said

18

at one point, the use of three different verbs, only one

19

of which is preempts, suggests that Congress' intent was

20

something more than merely to negate Federal preemption.

21

I respectfully submit that suggesting that Congress had

22

more in mind is not enough to meet the unmistakable

23

clarity standard.

24

unmistakable clarity standard means it would be plain to

25

anyone reading the act what Congress had in mind, and

Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, an

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

merely saying the use of three verbs suggests something

2

does not make it plain to anyone reading the act.

3

I do think -- Justice Stevens asked Ms. McDowell

4

if the Court needs to reach the Privileges and Immunities

5

Clause claim.

6

the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the limited

7

way we have suggested and that is because, although

8

Ms. McDowell correctly said the petitioners might prevail

9

on remand under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, I hope we

I -- I believe the Court does need to reach

10

will, and if we do that will give all of my clients the

11

relief that they need, we also might not prevail under the

12

Commerce Clause, and I think we're entitled to pursue both

13

the Commerce Clause claim and, with respect to the

14

individual petitioners, the Privileges and Immunities

15

Clause claim on remand.

16

The -- Justice Kennedy asked me some questions

17

in my opening argument about the Federal marketing orders

18

in effect in Nevada and Arizona, and I -- I perhaps didn't

19

speak with sufficient clarity about two aspects of that.

20

The Federal milk marketing orders cover parts of Nevada

21

but not other parts.

22

Federal milk marketing orders, but in any event, it's

23

worth making clear that the marketing orders fundamentally

24

operate on the processors of milk, not on the producers of

25

milk, so when we say the Federal milk marketing orders

Some are and some are not covered by

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

operate in parts of Nevada, we're really talking about

2

Nevada processors.

3

processor it -- it is at no point governed by a Federal

4

milk marketing order.

5

If you ship your milk to a California

Whatever -- with respect to the unmistakably

6

clear standard, Mr. Urban made the argument that once

7

you've found an unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause

8

exemption, the unmistakably clear standard has no more

9

role to play and it's just a matter of ordinary statutory

10
11

interpretation.
This Court's cases, I believe, do not support

12

that proposition, but he spoke specifically about the

13

McCarran-Ferguson Act cases in which the Court has

14

construed the phrase, business of insurance, without any

15

particular thumb on the scale.

16

Court must construe the phrase, business of insurance,

17

because Congress has delegated authority over an entire

18

business to the States.

19

Well, that is how the

That's very different from this very precisely

20

drawn statute that speaks about two particular aspects of

21

California's compositional regulation of raw milk and

22

saying, well, let's just resort to ordinary principles of

23

statutory interpretation to determine whether that also

24

reaches economic regulation of fluid milk.

25

unmistakably clear standard is still in effect, and

The

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

ingenious arguments about the relationship between

2

economic regulation of fluid milk and composition

3

regulation of raw milk are not enough to meet that

4

standard.
In particular, it cannot possibly be the case

5
6

that the 1997 amendments to California's pooling plan are

7

somehow necessary to effect composition regulation.

8

main thing the 1997 amendments did was not negate the

9

possibility that out-of-State milk would flood California

10

to such an extent that there would be price effects that

11

ultimately would have -- would have sanitary effects.

12

What the 1997 amendments did essentially was say, we're

13

going to intercept some of the revenue that would

14

otherwise go to out-of-State processors at California's

15

border and redistribute it just to in-State interests.

16

We're going to take some of the money that they would

17

otherwise get in their milk transaction and say, it must

18

go to Californians, not to you out-of-Staters.

The

That's the essence of the Commerce Clause

19
20

violation in this case, and it's also inconceivable that

21

that kind of regulation could be protected by this

22

statute.

23

statute, then a regulation that says 100 percent of every

24

milk check that would be written to a Nevadan must instead

go to a Californian is protected by this statute, i.e., no

If that kind of regulation is protected by this

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

out-of-State milk, and that can't possibly be the

2

unmistakably clear intent of Congress in section 7254.

3

One last detail, and it is just a detail.

4

Mr. Urban said that 10 to 15 percent of the milk that

5

comes into California is from out of State.

6

from a publication that's cited at page 39 of our opening

closer to 3 percent.
