CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

States.
Mr. Short.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHORT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On Friday, this Court entered its order stating

11
12

that counsel should be prepared to discuss the

13

jurisdiction of this Court and of the court of appeals,

14

and cited the Cohen v. Beneficial case, and they -QUESTION:

15

Mr. Short, did that subject

16

jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of

17

appeals?

18
19

MR. SHORT:

It did not come up in the court of

appeals, Justice O'Connor.

20

In the first --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SHORT:

23

It is interlocutory?
It's a decision from -- it's a final

decision under the collateral order doctrine.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SHORT:

Well, that's the issue.

Is it?

That's the issue, I believe, yes.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SHORT:

3

No trial has taken place?
No trial has taken place, not at

all.
I -- I believe that this Court, of course, has

4
5

jurisdiction pursuant to section 1254 because it granted a

6

writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

7

The court of appeals had jurisdiction pursuant to section

8

1291, providing for appeal of final decisions of the

9

district courts.

10

I believe this was a final decision

pursuant to the Cohen collateral final order doctrine.
Now, while this Court has not addressed the

11
12

collateral order doctrine under these set of facts, the

13

courts of appeals that have, have unanimously concluded

14

that an order approving the involuntary medication of a

15

pretrial detainee constitutes an appealable order under

16

Cohen, and these cases are set forth in footnote 5, page

17

10 of the Government's brief.

18

In order to fall within the collateral order

19

doctrine, the order must satisfy several requirements.

20

must conclusively determine the dispute question, it must

21

resolve an important issue completely and separate from

22

the merits of the underlying action, and it must be

23

effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final

24

judgment.

25

QUESTION:

Well, that's the question.

It

Would --

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

if it -- if we did not think there were jurisdiction, then

2

at the end of the day, if the defendant were tried, I

3

suppose that issue could be raised then.
MR. SHORT:

4

Except by that time, Justice

5

O'Connor, his rights will have already been infringed.

6

will not be able to become unmedicated.
QUESTION:

7

Well, but that's not the point.

He

The

8

point is whether the third requirement has been met, that

9

it is effectively nonreviewable unless it's reviewed this

10

way.

It seems to me it is reviewable.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SHORT:

We held that in Riggins.
Riggins -- Riggins was looking at a

13

post conviction case, however, and looking only to see if

14

his trial rights had been violated.

15

QUESTION:

Perhaps it depends on whether we're

16

talking about the right to avoid medication, as opposed to

17

the right to avoid medication for purposes of trial, and

18

the latter would give you maybe somewhat more difficulty

19

under prong 3, whereas the former, the right can only be

20

vindicated by treating this as a final order.

21

accept that, or would you say that it's final even if what

22

you're talking about is the right to avoid medication for

23

purposes of standing trial?

24
25

MR. SHORT:

Would you

I would say on all three it would.

Certainly under -- under the First and the Fifth

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Amendments, whatever rights he would have would have been

2

infringed irreparably once he's medicated.

3

QUESTION:

Well, are there -- are there no ways

4

to challenge that, except in the context of the criminal

5

prosecution?

6

medicated, whether for purposes of, of making your client

7

capable of standing trial or not, if you had objections to

8

being medicated, why couldn't those objections be brought

9

under section 1983 or in some civil action?

10

I mean, if -- if you had objections to being

MR. SHORT:

My reflections on that, Justice

11

Scalia, is, it would probably be too late.

12

brought any type of other action, I believe the Government

13

would have proceeded in the criminal case and gone ahead

14

with the order and had him medicated.

15

By the time we

I also see filing such an action with another

16

district court, for example, having it defer to the court

17

in which the criminal action was pending, I think there's

18

some -- I think there's some procedural problems with, by

19

the time that was done, Dr. Sell may have already been

20

medicated, and of course -- we will address these issues

21

hopefully in our briefs that are due, that are due Friday.

22
23

QUESTION:

What concerns me is, you know, the

Cohen doctrine is over half a century old.

24

MR. SHORT:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
It has no rooting in the text.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

The

1

text of Congress' statute is quite absolute.

We have made

2

in that half a century only three exceptions under the,

3

under the Cohen doctrine, and I'm truly concerned about,

4

about the extent to which this new exception would, would

5

be available to disrupt criminal trials considerably.

6

example, a defendant, instead of challenging the, the

7

order initially can, can half-way through trial decide he

8

does not want any medication, and then the trial has to be

9

postponed so that, so that the order to continue the

For

10

medication can be appealed.

11

in running a criminal justice system when, when this kind

12

of an order is immediately appealable, rather than

13

reviewable at the end of the criminal case.

14

MR. SHORT:

I just see real difficulties

Again, Justice Scalia, all I can say

15

is, I think by the time that would be reviewed, filed, and

16

considered, I'm afraid Dr. Sell will have been medicated,

17

and again we've already, of course --

18

QUESTION:

Well, that's perfectly true, but I

19

think the hypothesis offered by Justice Scalia, at least

20

as I understand it, is that even if that's the case,

21

perhaps he has to wait till the end of the criminal trial

22

in order to appeal it because our policy against piecemeal

23

appeals in criminal cases has been so strict.

24
25

MR. SHORT:

I do -- I do understand that, but --

and again, I think this is unreviewable.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Do you -- do you equate it to bail,

2

bail pending trial?

3

on, you can't get it back again once the trial is over.

4

Is -- is that your point, with respect to once -- once

5

he's drugged he can't be --

If it's denied, and the trial goes

6

MR. SHORT:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SHORT:

9

Once --- restored?
It's a simple statement, but once

he's medicated he can't be unmedicated.
QUESTION:

10

I think you're confusing unreviewable

11

with irreversible.

12

can it be reviewed?

13

reviewed, because once the trial is over, it's a moot

14

question.

15

can't be reversed, it cannot be reviewed.

16

To be sure, it can't be reversed, but
In the case of bail, it can't be

It cannot be reviewed.

It's not just that it

But you're here asserting that this issue cannot

17

be reviewed.

It seems to me that's just patently false.

18

It can be reviewed.

19

reversed, but that has never been the, the Cohen

20

criterion.

Your complaint is that it can't be

MR. SHORT:

My view, Justice Scalia, is it

22

can't be effectively reviewed.

23

24

meant to cause changes to take place.

25

of giving him these drugs.

Once he's medicated with

That's the purpose

In effect, the decision will

1

have been made, his mind will have been altered, in

2

whatever segment that is altered, and that cannot be

3

undone.
QUESTION:

4

That is his -- if that is his

5

objection, and if his objection is not that my criminal

6

trial will be distorted, he should bring a separate civil

7

action and perhaps the court would stay the criminal

8

action until that one is, until that civil action is

9

determined, but it's an entirely different procedure to

10

come in in the criminal case and seek an interlocutory

11

appeal from that order, and I just don't -QUESTION:

12

May I ask a question about the

13

back -- about the background order?

14

in this case the Bureau of Prisons got an order

15

authorizing them to medicate your, your client?

16

MR. SHORT:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Isn't it correct that

Justice Stevens, that is correct.
And then you got a stay of that

order?
MR. SHORT:

Yeah.

There was appeal -- there was

20

an appeal of that order, and then we filed a motion with

21

the magistrate judge to have a hearing as to whether or

22

not, as to the propriety of whether or not he should be

23

medicated, yes.

24

procedural standpoint --

25

That's -- that's the

QUESTION:

But to pursue Justice Stevens'

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

question, that order was in the context of this criminal

2

case.

3

MR. SHORT:

Yes, it was.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

The Bureau of Prisons order was in

6

the context of this criminal case?

7

they ordered him to be medicated before -- before the

8

trial was -- was on the horizon.
MR. SHORT:

9

I -- I thought that

Is that --

He was -- he was sent to the

10

Springfield Medical Center after being found incompetent

11

under section 4241, in order to be treated to see if he

12

could be restored to competency.
QUESTION:

13

You're going to brief this issue, so

14

perhaps we ought to, since your time is running out, hear

15

something on the merits of your --

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

2

others?

3

MR. SHORT:

Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.

The

district court made that finding, and -- and --

essentially reversing the magistrate court, and the

appellate court affirmed the district court's finding that

he was not dangerous.

But another feature of this disorder is that

apart from the direct impact of the delusions,

psychosocial functioning is not markedly, markedly

that he is a) medically competent -- no one has ever

contended that Dr. Sell is not medically competent.

decisions, and make his own decisions about his mind and

And is there a finding below that

you assert that there can be no medication?

And that the medication is medically

appropriate?

Yes, there was such a finding.

law that justifies your position?

competent, he can make decisions about his own person and

He was charged with that offense,

yes.

11

QUESTION:

He doesn't sound nondangerous.

do this on the hypothetical basis that he isn't, although

maybe he is?

read the cases, pretrial detainees -- these are civilly

committed people -- can be medically administered

and they are dangerous to themselves --

24
25

QUESTION:

So a person who's in a mental

hospital, civilly committed, and he's dangerous, going to

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

commit suicide or possibly kill someone, that the doctors

2

in that civil setting are forbidden to administer

3

psychotic drugs?

That's not my understanding.

4

MR. SHORT:

Maybe I -- maybe I --

5

QUESTION:

-- what you're saying?

6

MR. SHORT:

Maybe I misstated --

7

QUESTION:

Is that --

All right, but -- so -- but my

8

question on this case is the following.

I take it you

9

say, to follow the psychological association's standards,

10

one, the court did consider whether any nondrug therapy

11

could restore him to competence, and it answered the

12

question, no.

13

The court did consider whether there was a

14

substantial likelihood of success in restoring the

15

defendant to competence, and they answered, yes.

16

The court did consider whether the effectiveness

17

of the drugs clearly outweighed the risk from side

18

effects, and it said yes.

19

It also considered the effects of the Fifth and

20

Sixth Amendment rights to fair trial, and decided they

21

weren't enough to change the question, so it seems to me

22

that once you concede all that, they're following the

23

right standards.

24
25

So is your claim that we should go and review
because they, although they purported to follow the right

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

standards they didn't really do it, in other words, going

2

to the facts of this case, or is your claim that those

3

standards that your side's amicus says are the right ones,

4

are not the right ones and, if so, what are?
MR. SHORT:

5

Our view is that, first of all we

6

have fundamental rights at stake here, and the Government

7

must show then, of course, a compelling interest in

8

overriding those fundamental interests.
QUESTION:

9
10

But I would appreciate a direct

answer to my question.

11

MR. SHORT:

12

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Maybe I misunderstood --

It seems to me, either you have to

13

say that the psychological association standards are

14

wrong, or you have to say they're right, and if you say

15

they're right, then you have to ask us to say they weren't

16

applied correctly here, but I want to know if you think

17

they're the wrong ones, or if you think they're the right

18

ones.

MR. SHORT:

I think essentially those are the

right standards.
QUESTION:

6
7

-- they have four standards, so I'm

asking you if you think those are the right standards.

4
5

Yes.

Okay.

If you think those are there

right standards, do you think they were applied here?

8

MR. SHORT:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes, all right.

Then is what you're

10

asking us to do, since you think they were applied, and

11

you don't like the answer the court came to, is what

12

you're asking us to do today is take those standards, look

13

to see how the court applied them, and come to the

14

conclusion that they applied them incorrectly, or are you

15

asking us to do something else?

16

MR. SHORT:

QUESTION:

MR. SHORT:

QUESTION:

That's it.

20

QUESTION:

And I -- I don't know why you concede

Essentially -I'm just trying to clarify -Essentially that's it.

21

that the Government has this right at all.

Government the authority to medicate a pretrial detainee

23

or someone pretrial -- supposing they're not even in, in

24

Because 4241 provides that a person

12

MR. SHORT:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, he does.

He does, and --

And I thought that the whole reason

14

why we're -- how you got to this stage is that a district

court made a finding that this man is not a danger to

16

himself or others, and now you want to say for purposes of

17

the -- your being here on that question, could he be

medicated, because he's not a danger to himself or others,

that finding holds, but once he avoids the trial, then he

can say, ah, but for purposes of civil commitment I am

22

MR. SHORT:

No, that -- that's not what will

happen to Dr. Sell.

He will then go from the 4241 to

Justice Scalia's question.
MR. SHORT:

No, I will tell you, from my

going to happen, because of what the Government's view is

16

of this individual.

No, but you --

18

Well, I -- I hope that's what's going

to happen, but I -- but I don't know how it -- how it

comes about with the law as you've described it to us.

That's -- that's my problem.

22

QUESTION:

I have a different problem.

Let me

23

explain to you what -- I imagine that the slogan, mind-

altering drugs, is not a very good slogan for present

of people, how are they any different from the class of

at risk, and could be perhaps medicated with blood

antidelusional medicine.

between those two circumstances?

10

These people could be medicated with
Now, is there a difference

That doesn't answer the question, because what

I'm looking for are the right standards to use to separate

those genuinely ill people from others who may be more

borderline, or may be less obviously helped.

14

Now, you don't -- I realize now you don't have

15

much time, but I'm -- that's what I'm struggling with in

this case.

MR. SHORT:

The standard, the standard, Your

18

Honor, is whether or not -- and this is very basic,

whether the person has the right to make the choice.

20

position is that Dr. Sell has the right to make the choice

21

over his medical decisions.

He has had experience with antipsychotic drugs.

serious side effect in at least three cases, Harper,

Riggins, and Mills.

2

told him that antipsychotic drugs will not work on

3

delusional disorders, and Dr. Sell, with all due respect

4

to what he's charged with, is not a stupid person.

5

does not want to undergo the effects of antipsychotic

medication.

Dr. Sell's claim should be analyzed as having two

related but distinct components.

20

claim is a Harper-style objection to forcible medication

21

by the Government in order to render him competent to

stand trial.

in fact, he is medicated and restored to competence and

Well, it's not just they're

unreviewable, Mr. Dreeben, but it would -- I think we said

QUESTION:

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, and --

Not to be tried at all.

That right will be lost if, in fact, he is

medicated.

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

evidence that I want suppressed but the court has ruled

2

otherwise?
MR. DREEBEN:

3

Well, that's right and that's

4

because the court has concluded that there is no right not

5

to be tried in the relevant sense without particular

6

evidence that will be suppressed.

7

right whose remedy would be a right not to have the

8

evidence used against them, which could include reversal

9

of a conviction, so that kind of a claim is reviewable at

10

What that reflects is a

the end of the case.
But taking Dr. Sell's claims at face value, he's

11
12

saying it will violate my First Amendment rights and my

13

substantive due process rights to be medicated, and those

14

claims are, in a sense, independent of the main criminal

15

action.

16

could be viewed as claims that could be brought

17

independently, but I think under the statutory scheme that

18

exists they are better brought in the context of the

19

criminal case, rather than through an independent APA

20

action or some other form of action.

21

Justice Scalia is correct that in a sense they

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I'd be less worried if, if

22

all that was before us here is the up or down question

whether you have an absolute right to refuse medication,

that's not what's before us here.

That is not the only

thing.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

It -- it's not a one-time

Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit

13

less concerned about the practical consequences, although

14

I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and,

15

more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting

16

the medication is a critical problem that results from

17

collateral order review, but there are two things that I

18

think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting

19

collateral order review.

20

First, if this Court does settle the fundamental

21

question in favor of the Government and determines that,

22

on an appropriate showing that this court defines,

23

medication for the purpose of restoring competence is

24

permissible, in the future, criminal defendants will not

25

be able to assert that broad, unsettled, and important

application of those standards to the particular facts of

a heightened form of review is appropriate.

I don't have

any case that has precisely articulated the correct

standard of review, but in all of this Court's substantive

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the authority would be an

application of any principle that this Court adopts in

22

this case to permit us to medicate the defendant.

23

indicated, there is a distinction between a witness and a

24

defendant, but here we deal with someone who has already

25

been placed under indictment, which is to an -- a certain

As I

extent a significant restriction on liberty as well as an

QUESTION:

4

5

seems to me that you should have statutory authority for

6

doing this.

7

the witnesses behave a certain way and order medication -MR. DREEBEN:

8
9

Just the court thinks it's a good idea that

Well, I think maybe it's important

to back up and look at how this case came to be before the

10

Court.

Dr. Sell was found to be incompetent to stand

11

trial, and pursuant to statute section 4241(d) of title

12

18, he was committed to the Bureau of Prisons for

13

treatment to determine whether his competency could be

14

restored.
In the context of that confinement at a medical

15
16

facility, pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of

17

Prisons, the Bureau of Prisons determined that

18

antipsychotic medication and nothing else was the means by

19

which the Government could restore him to competency.
QUESTION:

20

But that, that was competency for

21

trial.

22

standard in the regulations, as I understand them.

23

That's -- that's -- that's the -- that's not the

MR. DREEBEN:

No, the regulations do indeed

24

address the potential of medication for the purpose of

25

rendering competence to stand trial.

That's one of the

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

criteria that is given to the Bureau of Prisons when it

2

accepts a patient for treatment under section 4241(d), and

3

the bureau in fact made the finding that this was a

4

medically appropriate treatment for a person who has the

5

illness, the serious delusional disorder that Dr. Sell

6

has, and that this treatment had a substantial probability

7

of restoring him to competence.
QUESTION:

8
9

The --

Mr. Dreeben, can you back up just for

a minute, because there's a piece of this that I'm not

10

clear on.

11

to stand trial came up, the Bureau of Prisons had

12

determined this man to be dangerous to himself or others

13

without medication, and that the Bureau of Prisons was

14

going to medicate him under the danger standard.

15

I thought that before the issue of competence

MR. DREEBEN:

The administrative order, and it's

16

the same administrative order that I referred to in

17

answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg,

18

does rest on both restoration of competency and to a

19

certain extent on concerns about danger.

20

What happened after the Bureau of Prisons

21

entered that order is not that it immediately implemented

22

it and began to medicate Dr. Sell.

23

order, and Dr. Sell then sought judicial review in the

24

very court that had ordered his commitment, which is why I

25

think that it was appropriate for the district court to

Rather, it stayed the

separate APA action.

3

ordered Dr. Sell confined.

4

This is the district court that had

The magistrate judge determined that the

5

Government had not made a showing of dangerousness, which

6

would have permitted medication under Washington v.

7

Harper, but that it had adequately shown that medication

8

was necessary in order to restore Dr. Sell to be competent

9

for trial.

10

Dr. Sell then appealed that determination to the

11

district court, which entered its final decision saying

12

that the Bureau of Prisons could medicate, there was a

13

substantial probability of restoring competence, the

14

antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate

15

treatment for the psychotic illness that Dr. Sell had, and

16

that there was a reasonable likelihood of a fair trial,

17

and any particularized fair trial concerns that Dr. Sell

18

was raising, involving effects on his demeanor, or his

19

the medication has been administered and it's been

determined whether, in fact, he was restored to

23

QUESTION:

Can we get your answer to the

24

question that Justice Scalia asked Mr. Short?

That is,

25

suppose it is determined that he can't be medicated for

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the purpose of making him competent, what happens to him?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

Well, at that point, Mr. Short is

3

correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to

4

the director of a medical facility where he would be held

5

for confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246,

6

whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or

7

others.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, all right, suppose he's not.

Then he goes free.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

And --

And the question I would like to know

12

is, suppose that you have a person who has very high blood

13

pressure, a defendant.

14

permissible under the law, to force him to take blood

15

pressure medication so that he can go to trial?
MR. DREEBEN:

16

Is it permissible, or clearly

It is not something that courts of

17

appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this

All right, so we have exactly the

same question.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

you can force a person to take medicine that makes him

7

then the question comes back to, assuming we have the

8

right standards, which are, I think you and the APA agree,

9

the psychological people, I don't see much of a difference

10

there between you, the lower courts, and the -- as to the

11

standards if you can medicate a comp -- if you can

12

medicate such a person at all, and so what we know is that

13

you can go to the person with high blood pressure or the

14

person who is seriously mentally ill, and you can medicate

15

him, because the Government has a good reason, where he is

16

going to be tried for murder, assault, et cetera, all

17

right.
Here we have a property crime.

18

Is this still a

19

good reason?

Suppose it were a traffic ticket?

I mean, I

20

take it this is a person whom, in the absence of a

21

criminal proceeding, the Government could not compel to

22

take medication.

Am I right?

Now, I've given you a number of things.

I'm

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you a question

6

that I've been trying to -- thinking about for quite a

7

while?

8

custody, as compared to the potential sentence he might

9

receive, relevant to the analysis?

10

Is the amount of time he's already been in

MR. DREEBEN:

It may be, Justice Stevens,

11

relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have

12

held that the amount of time that a person can be held for

13

treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate

14

sentence that they would receive.

15

QUESTION:

And is that not true in this case?

MR. DREEBEN:

No, it's not true in this case for

a number of reasons.

But if you assumed it was the

has already approached that, that time?
MR. DREEBEN:

6

Yes, it probably is.

Of course,

7

he's also charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to

It relied entirely on the financial

MR. DREEBEN:

You're right, Justice Stevens, but

16

18

for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and

19

the length that the Government can hold --

21

in this case that we take into account the indictment

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, again, if-- if a court were

to hold -- it's not critical to my position, because my

5

position is, it's statutory maximum.

6

hold that we're not going to look at the attempted murder

7

and conspiracy murder charges, we are only going to look

8

at the sentencing guidelines sentence, and we are going to

9

hold that he cannot be held for treatment longer than his

10

ultimate potential sentence, then the Court would have no

11

choice but to remand for treatment of Dr. Sell under 4246

12

to determine whether he should be civilly committed.

If the Court were to

2

has he been getting any other kind of treatment for his

3

ailment?

MR. DREEBEN:

Essentially, no, and the reason is

5

that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone,

6

that would have any likelihood of success with a person

7

with delusional disorder, persecutory type.

8

serious thought disorder, interfering with Dr. Sell's

9

ability to rationally understand what is going on in the

This is a

10

world, and it's well-established in the medical literature

11

that antipsychotic medication and nothing else is the only

12

thing that may hold promise of treating the -- the ailment

13

that he has.

14

Now, the -- the --

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you to comment
One of the

15

on this, on the question of medication?

16

arguments is that if you accept, for example, essentially

17

your standard or the psychological association's standard,

18

in applying it, you cannot apply it, as it were, in gross.

19

You've got to apply it with reference to the specific

20

medication which is proposed, and that was not done in

21

this case.

22

because the effects of the various possible antipsychotic

23

medications may vary tremendously.

24
25

I think the argument is, it's important

Would you comment on that argument, that even if
we accept the standards, they -- they were not adequately

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

met here because the -- the order was not drug-specific?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

I -- Justice Souter, if a court

3

were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a

4

patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical

5

reality of what this treatment will entail.

6

Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or

7

consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in

8

his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine

9

and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable

10

ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal

11

side effect profile, that they would have a much better

12

chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that

13

he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his

14

trial.
But he explained that he did not want to be

15
16

locked into a particular medication because one of his

17

hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell

18

would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's

19

ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to

20

take.

21

This is the kind of interactive process that

22

doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to

23

superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this

24

and only this medication can be administered is --

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, isn't there something

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

short of that, though?

2

there are the old kind of drugs that could be injected,

3

and the new drugs, which originally had to be taken

4

orally.

5

drugs, not the particular drug within that category, or

6

even a decision between something that's injectable and

7

something that we'd have to force him to swallow, isn't --

8

isn't that kind of determination something that the --

9

shouldn't -- shouldn't there be some control over the

10
11

I mean, we -- we are told that

Isn't -- that distinction between the category of

Government's discretion?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I think the Court

12

should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial

13

decision making process on a --

14

QUESTION:

But just asking the Government to

15

identify that general class of drugs, not the court making

16

the decision in the first instance.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

The -- the problem with that,

18

Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual

19

patient has to a drug is individual-specific.

20

effects can be described in general categories, but nobody

21

knows what side effects will actually occur, or whether

22

the drugs will be effective until they've been

23

administered, and it is not uncommon for the treating

24

psychiatrist to discover that a drug that may have a

25

wildly, you know, significant side effect in one

Side

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

individual has none in another, and a drug that's

2

anticipated to be entirely successful turns out not to be

3

successful.

4

One of the newer, new generation of drugs, the

5

atypical drugs that have the more favorable side effect

6

profiles in general may not turn out to be suitable for a

7

particular patient.

8

QUESTION:

9

But of course, one answer to that is,

this is sufficiently serious so that you ought to have to

10

come back.

11

premise of your argument is that there's kind of an

12

either-or choice that is made here, medicate or don't

13

medicate, but if the -- if the substan -- if a substantive

14

due process right is recognized, one question here is, how

15

serious is it, and maybe it ought to be regarded as so

16

serious that the Government would have to come back.

17

In other words, in -- in -- in -- the -- the

MR. DREEBEN:

That would -- might be true,

18

Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were

19

antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the

20

difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment

21

that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the

22

classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical

23

drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic

24

drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences

25

between them, but they belong to a family of medications

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that are used for treatment all the time, and the

2

psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of

3

effects that might be achieved is not likely to be

4

enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are

5

the potential side effects so dramatically different that

6

it calls for an entirely different substantive due process

7

analysis.

8
9

QUESTION:

May I ask you a different question

about seriousness, and I think it was raised originally by

10

a question from Justice Kennedy, and I'm not -- I'm not

11

sure of the facts or of your answer.

12

Should we treat this, assuming we are going to

13

recognize it, as sufficiently serious that the Government

14

should have no power in the absence of legislation, and if

15

that is so, is there any legislation that authorizes this?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

There is legislation that

17

authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an

18

individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he

19

has been determined incompetent.

20

4241(d) says.

21
22
23

That's what section

Now, it does not --

QUESTION:

So it's treat for purposes of

competency?
MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, and it does not

24

specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in

25

1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a

2

defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic

3

medication or -QUESTION:

4

But you say the Government can do

5

this even if the defendant is, is not in custody, and just

6

to follow this same point, suppose a defendant not in

7

custody, at home, is undergoing a hunger strike and he's

8

going to die before the trial.

9

out and force feed him?
MR. DREEBEN:

10

Can the Government come

You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll

11

answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves

12

a very different set of considerations, because the

13

intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to

14

die might be considered to be a very different decision

15

than treating an ill person's illness with medication that

16

is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds

17

of disorders.
QUESTION:

18

But if -- but if your -- but if your

19

interest is in making the defendant stand trial, it

20

would -- it would seem to me that you could per -- suppose

21

it was for -- I don't -- I -- we could play with the

22

hypothetical, and your time has about run out.

23

just don't understand your basic authority to do this at

24

all.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I still

Well, as a matter of the

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

organization of Government, this Court has recognized that

2

the ability to resolve criminal charges through the

3

mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in

4

maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try

5

these criminal charges, the Government has no option but

6

to attempt to restore competency.

7

QUESTION:

What's the most intrusive thing that

8

it's clear the Government can do to get the defendant

9

inside the courthouse door?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it -- it's quite clear that

11

the Government may seize the person and hold them in

12

pretrial detention, which is a --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

All right, physically seizing him,

shackling him, I guess.
MR. DREEBEN:

Anything else?
Not that this Court has

16

considered, but this -- this kind of medication has to be

17

judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion

18

and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who

19

have this kind of disorder.

20

committed to the Bureau of Prisons' care for incompetency

21

determinations has some form of psychotic disorder that

22

can be treated.

23

Virtually everyone who is

There are, of course, organic problems that

24

cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of

25

mental illness that can create this, but the statistics

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering

2

this case shows that 80 percent of the individuals who are

3

committed take these drugs voluntarily.

4

Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's

5

very little indication that any sort of judicial relief

6

has been sought through appellate review, and I think

7

that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious

8

psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality

9

where they can make decisions about what they want to do

10
11

with their life.
So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps

12

being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons

13

facility, where they may be warehoused without any

14

treatment, or being released if they are not subject to

15

civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on

16

criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences,

17

most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an

18

initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so

19

that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the

20

medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to

21

deal with the disease that they have.

22

And when the Government has no mechanism to

23

achieve its essential interest in adjudicating criminal

24

charges but for using these medically appropriate means,

25

and it can show the, the items that have been laid out in

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

our brief of medical appropriateness, no less-restrictive

2

alternative, and that there's a reason to expect that a

3

fair trial will not be precluded, the Government should

4

appropriately have the authority to override the

5

substantive due process interest that the defendant has

6

asserted and medicate him.
