ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NAGER:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth

11
12

Circuit held that a municipality may be held liable in

13

damages because it withheld the issuance of building

14

permits for a proposed housing project pending a citizen-

15

initiated referendum election on the ordinance authorizing

16

that housing project.
In so doing, the Sixth Circuit failed to

17
18

appreciate that the municipality's actions here were all

19

taken pursuant to pre-existing procedures set forth in the

20

city's charter, procedures that the city followed to the

21

letter.

22

prescribed course, the municipality's actions here were

23

necessarily rational ones taken without discriminatory

24

motives and without treating the respondents here any

25

differently than any other beneficiary of an ordinance

As non-discretionary acts taken in the normal

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would have been treated that was subject to a petition.

2

And for that reason, we respectfully suggest that the

3

Sixth Circuit -QUESTION:

4

There's no evidence of some kind of

5

misbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare

6

claim that they refused to issue the permit during the

7

process of the referendum?
MR. NAGER:

8
9

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

Every official action of the city here favored the

10

respondents.

The city planning commission recommended

11

approval of the housing project and of the site plan

12

authorizing the housing project.

13

in favor of the housing project.
QUESTION:

14

The city council voted

Wasn't there some evidence that some

15

city official was -- sought to delay the proceedings for a

16

period of time, not -- not officially.

17

pass any resolution, but didn't they oppose immediate

18

action on a couple of occasions?
MR. NAGER:

19

It didn't take --

Justice Stevens, prior to the city

20

council voting on the -- the ordinance to approve the

21

project, there was a lot of public debate, and in that

22

public debate, there were city officials who said we --

23

we need to take time to hear the citizens -- citizens'

24

concerns.

25

doing, and there were even comments, we should fight this.

We need to take time to understand what we're

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

We should fight this and delay this.
QUESTION:

Supposing one of those comments said

3

we should fight this because we don't want

4

African-Americans to -- to move where they're going to

5

move, would that make any difference?

6

MR. NAGER:

7

QUESTION:

It -- it could make a difference.
Because even -- if that had happened,

8

it would still be true, as you pointed out earlier, that

9

every official action taken by the city was favorable to

10
11

the -- your opponents.
MR. NAGER:

Well, if -- if the actions were

12

taken favorably to the opponents, it couldn't make a

13

difference because at that point the alleged statement

14

wouldn't have any connection to an adverse action.

15

That -- that's the important point in this case because in

16

order to have discrimination, either in violation of the

17

Equal Protection Clause, or in violation of the Fair

18

Housing Act, you not only have to have a motive, you have

19

to have adverse differential treatment by the person --

20

QUESTION:

So what -- I'm trying to be sure

21

I understand.

I -- I think I understand your position.

22

Is -- your position is that even if this ambiguous

23

evidence was -- clearly showed racial hostility and that's

24

why we're trying to delay it, there still would be no

25

cause of action because everything the city did was in

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

favor of -- officially was in favor of --

2

MR. NAGER:

3

QUESTION:

That -- that's correct.
So that really, we don't have to try

4

and draw -- to decide whether or not inferences of

5

improper motive can be drawn from those statements.

6

MR. NAGER:

That's correct because in this case,

7

all of the city's actions either favored the project or

8

non-discretionary actions.

9

QUESTION:

Now, what if the city had taken the

10

same official action that it took in this case, and every

11

official action either favored or was at least neutral,

12

and yet the city officials went out and -- and whipped up,

13

in effect, anti-black sentiment and -- and urged the

14

filing of the application for the referendum, would the

15

answer -- would the -- would the result be the same,

16

that -- that there would be no way that the city could be

17

held liable?

18

MR. NAGER:

The short answer to that question is

19

the answer would be the same.

20

referendum were enacted, it went to a vote and it were put

21

into effect and it was racially motivated, that action

22

would be subject to challenge because that would be, in

23

fact, an action of the city because they would have

24

adopted, under your hypothetical facts, an ordinance that

25

could allegedly have a discriminatory intent.

Of course, if the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But isn't the -- isn't the delay

2

simply a -- even the delay in -- in an instance in which

3

the ordinance is defeated simply a lesser degree of

4

damage, but which would, nonetheless, be -- be subject to

5

a claim?
MR. NAGER:

6

And the answer to that is no.

And

7

the answer to that is no because the delay that happened

8

here is the delay that would happen with regard to any

9

referendum that was subject to a referendum petition.

10

And

the record here is quite clear -QUESTION:

11

Well, it -- there's -- there's no

12

question that it -- it would, but is -- is the -- is

13

either the -- the statute in question here or the Equal

14

Protection Clause blind to an obvious reason for the

15

delay?

16

the assumption that mere delay in governmental processes

17

does not give rise to a cause of action, but when the

18

delay is induced by city officials for a racially

19

discriminatory reason, aren't we then in a different case?
MR. NAGER:

20
21

24
25

We start with

Well, it's a different case, but

it's not different outcome here, and the -QUESTION:

22
23

In other words, I -- I quite agree.

Why shouldn't it be a different

outcome?
MR. NAGER:

Well, because under Monell and its

progeny, as well as this Court's State action cases, the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

municipality can be held liable only in damages only if

2

the city -- an official with the authority to authorize it

3

has authorized the discriminatory action that you're

4

talking about.

5

official action favored the project, and the delay that

6

you're talking about was authorized by a city charter

7

created 30 years before the fact.
QUESTION:

8
9

In this specific instance, the -- every

Well, the mechanism -- the mechanism

is provided by the city charter.
I guess what I'm getting at is that if city

10
11

officials -- let's just say the mayor, for the sake of

12

argument, or the mayor and the city council -- in effect,

13

do not establish a policy in the sense that they say, we

14

want to stop black housing projects, but they follow a

15

policy of trying to make it difficult for those housing

16

projects to be approved, and one way they do that is by

17

spurring the -- the request for referendums.

18

we're going to apply the Monell rule here, isn't that a

19

policy position of the city even within the meaning of

20

Monell?

21

MR. NAGER:

Assuming

No, because they wouldn't have the

22

authority to do that.

There's a difference between six

23

city council members voting at a city council meeting as

24

to what the actions of the city are, and six city council

25

members going out on their own in their private capacities

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and expressing their views as citizens, and -- and trying

2

to get other citizens to agree with them as to their

3

private views.

4

QUESTION:

But not --

5

QUESTION:

Well, supposing, Mr. Nager, that you

6

have, say, a -- say, a seven-member city council and it's

7

confronted with a project like this.

8

members of the city council says that, you know, he's

9

opposed to this because he doesn't want African-Americans

And one of the seven

10

moving into this area.

11

council simply treat the thing on the merits.

12

action of this one individual taint the whole action of

13

the city?

14

MR. NAGER:

The other six members of the city

Well, it shouldn't.

Does the

Under Arlington

15

Heights and this Court's cases, the city could be held

16

liable only if those authorized, in this instance a

17

majority of the city council, had the -- the

18

discriminatory --

19

QUESTION:

What if the vote was four to three?

20

MR. NAGER:

Four -- if it was four to three in

21

favor of the housing project --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. NAGER:

No.

Against the housing project.

If -- if they had discretionary

24

power, and four of them exercised their discretionary

25

power against the housing project on the basis of racially

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

discriminatory --

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, only one had the racially

discriminatory motive, one of the four.

4

MR. NAGER:

Well --

5

QUESTION:

The other three did it on the merits.

6

MR. NAGER:

I think there, there would be a good

7

argument that they would still -- that -- that the

8

plaintiffs would have -- would have satisfied their burden

9

of showing but for the racially discriminatory motive,

10

that the housing project would have been approved.

11

in -- in that hypothetical, which is not the facts of this

12

case, of course, they -- they would have had sufficient

13

evidence to state a claim.
QUESTION:

14

So

And your difference in the two cases

15

is, one, you have an official action taken.

project.

We deny the

Here you don't have that.
But suppose there had been, to take the clearest

17
18

case, a tape of a meeting.

19

the head of the city council, they all got together and

20

say, we want to kill this project and we know that the

21

most effective way to do that is through this referendum

22

because the people won't like it and they'll vote against

23

it.

24

out and then, as the last act, instigate a referendum.

25

The mayor, the legal director,

So they have a deliberate plan to string the thing

And as I take it, your argument -- you would --

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're saying even if you have that scenario, there would

2

still be no municipal liability.
MR. NAGER:

3

Am I correct?

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

4

It's obviously our hardest hypothetical, but it's also the

5

same answer.

6

same answer is because, remember, under your hypothetical,

7

the notion is that if these city officials, not acting in

8

their -- exercising their official powers, but acting in

9

the role any citizen can, can go out and organize the

And it -- and one of the reasons it's the

10

citizens of the community acting in their private

11

capacities to get a referendum on the ballot and vote

12

against it.

13

It's about politicians taking on causes on behalf of

14

people --

15

Of course, that's what democracy is about.

QUESTION:

Mr. Nager, I think -- I understand

16

your argument as it applies to the city, but am I correct

17

that the mayor is an individual defendant in this case?

18

MR. NAGER:

He was.

He was granted summary

19

judgment by the district court on the ground that there

20

was no evidence that he in his individual capacity had

21

committed any of the acts that were alleged against him,

22

and that he had not organized the campaign --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But -- but wasn't that reversed by

the Sixth Circuit?
MR. NAGER:

No, it wasn't.

That issue was not

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taken up to the Sixth Circuit.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. NAGER:

Why is he a petitioner then?
He's only here in his official

4

capacity.

5

in his official capacity.

6
7

He was sued in both his individual capacity and

QUESTION:

I see.

So there's no individual

liability at stake here at all.

8

MR. NAGER:

No, not -- not --

9

QUESTION:

Is -- is the --

10

QUESTION:

I'd like to ask a question, which is

11

these have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are

12

you going to have time to talk about the questions that we

13

granted cert on?

14

MR. NAGER:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Well -And I'm interested -- what we have in

front of us now at this point as issues.
MR. NAGER:

The issue that you have before us is

18

the Sixth Circuit's judgment is -- is -- because under the

19

Sixth Circuit's view there was allegedly evidence of

20

racial bias among the citizens that the municipality could

21

be -- somehow be held liable for that.

22

for two reasons.

23

And that's wrong

One, it's wrong because the municipality itself

24

has to have the discriminatory animus, and there's no --

25

not only no evidence of that here, it couldn't have been

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the case since they -- of course, all of their actions

2

were voting in favor of it, or treating the action

3

neutrally.

4

Secondly --

5

QUESTION:

6

Arguably the discriminatory animus on

the part of the citizens could invalidate the referendum.

7

MR. NAGER:

If it was voted on and put into

8

effect, the alleged animus --

9

QUESTION:

No.

Even -- even if it wasn't put

10

into effect.

It -- if there were that animus, it -- it

11

could -- by our past cases anyway, if it could be shown,

12

it would -- it would invalidate the referendum.

13

point is that whether the referendum was valid or invalid,

14

the municipality would have had to stay the project.

15

wasn't up to the municipality to make the judgment.
MR. NAGER:

16

But your

It

That -- that is correct, Justice

17

Scalia.

18

Court's cases, the Court has never said that -- that the

19

First Amendment activity of a petition itself is subject

20

to an equal protection challenge.

21

I -- I do want to make clear that under this

What the Court's cases say is if there is a

22

vote, either on a bill by elected representatives, or on a

23

petition by citizens, that the end product of that, which

24

becomes a law, can be challenged, and that private animus

25

in that -- is contextual evidence for whether or not the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

people who voted on that final product were themselves

2

motivated by discriminatory animus.
QUESTION:

3
4

You're -- you're talking about people

who vote in a referendum?
MR. NAGER:

5

Well, the -- the question is if

6

there's a final product, was the -- the final law, was

7

that racially motivated -QUESTION:

8
9

But we -- we've never said -- we've

never tried to examine the motives of -- of the citizenry

10

who vote in a referendum on that sort of question, have

11

we?
MR. NAGER:

12

No, you haven't, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

What the Court has said is, is that intent of the law is

14

the key test, and what the Court has said in Arlington

15

Heights is because you can't look directly at the motives

16

of the people who voted on it, whether they be legislators

17

protected by the Speech and Debate Clause or citizens

18

protected by the -- the secrecy of the ballot in this

19

country, they look at other indicia to determine their

20

intent.

21
22

QUESTION:

But Arlington Heights was a city

council, or --

23

MR. NAGER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. NAGER:

That's correct.
-- was it not?
That's correct.

1

QUESTION:

What -- what is --

2

QUESTION:

And here the referendum failed.

3

MR. NAGER:

That -- well, the -- we don't know

4

the outcome because the respondents asked for the final

5

vote not to be certified.

6

But what is important here, I think, to address

7

the issue in this case, Justice O'Connor, is that the --

8

the position of the Sixth Circuit here is that the

9

municipality is somehow supposed to inquire behind a

10

facially neutral referendum petition and determine the

11

intent and motives of people engaged in the First

12

Amendment.

13

QUESTION:

Did -- did the city have discretion

14

here to go ahead and issue building permits while the

15

referendum process was pending?

16

MR. NAGER:

No, it didn't.

Once the referendum

17

petition was filed, under the city charter, the -- at that

18

point, all the city council could do is repeal its own

19

ordinance or submit the ordinance to a vote of the voters.

20

QUESTION:

So what is the claim in your opinion

21

that we are reviewing?

22

The Sixth Circuit, insofar as its -- insofar as we're

23

concerned, we're interested in what the lower courts held.

24

MR. NAGER:

25

QUESTION:

I mean, I want it to be specific.

Correct.
What, in your opinion, is the claim

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that they're reviewing?

2

individuals, the mayor, the clerk, and an engineer, acting

3

in their official capacities, violated the Fourteenth

4

Amendment or other parts of the Constitution when they

5

refused to issue the permit despite the petition and

6

despite the provision?

7

claim they did something else as well?

8

the petition people, or they did some other thing.

9
10

MR. NAGER:

Is the claim that these three

Is that the claim?

Or is the

They stirred up

Well, the -- the Sixth Circuit said

it was the former.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. NAGER:

Only the first.
Correct.

Respondents in their brief

13

have abandoned what the Sixth Circuit held and which we

14

petitioned and the Court granted cert to review to argue a

15

completely different theory.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you, Mr. Nager, is the

17

complaint in the record?

18

in the papers here?

19

MR. NAGER:

I couldn't find it.

In the --

I don't believe that it is.

No, I

don't believe -- I mean, it's -- it's obviously in the

21

record of the case.

1

there some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert

2

on three questions --

3

MR. NAGER:

Well, you did --

4

QUESTION:

Have they given up on the second one?

5

MR. NAGER:

Well, they've abandoned their claim

6

that they litigated and prevailed on in the Sixth Circuit,

7

that they could proceed on the disparate impact theory.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. NAGER:

10

13

A -- a substantive due process

claim.
QUESTION:

11
12

And the last is a due process?

Substantive due process?

Yes.
MR. NAGER:

And the Sixth Circuit held that

14

there was a triable question of fact as to whether or not

15

the city had acted rationally in proceeding forward with

16

its referendum petition.

17

answer to that was at that time, the city charter required

18

the city officials to do so and that judgment was adopted

19

by three courts until the Ohio Supreme Court several years

20

later reversed itself on what the meaning of the Ohio

21

constitution was.

22

highest court's evaluation of what the law was can't

23

change the rationality of the acts at the time that they

24

were taken.

25

QUESTION:

And we would say that the simple

But the subsequent reversal of this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS
MR. SALMONS:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondents challenge only the delay caused by

7
8

the city charter's neutral, longstanding provisions

9

facilitating the orderly processing of citizen-initiated

10

referenda to review ordinances passed by the city council.

11

Such a challenge requires courts to balance the vital

12

First Amendment right implicated in the referendum process

13

with the equally valid goals of equal protection and fair

14

housing.

15

In this case, that balance is clear.

The city's

16

actions in giving effect to the properly filed referendum

17

petition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair

18

Housing Act or the Equal Protection Clause.

19

undisputed that the referendum petition was facially

20

neutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds

21

supported it.

22

It is

It is also undisputed that the city's process

23

for handling such petitions was longstanding and

24

race-neutral.

25

have failed to provide any evidence that the referendum

Under any conceivable standard, respondents

1

process was tainted with discriminatory motive either on

2

the part of the city officials or the petition organizers.
QUESTION:

3

Suppose it was.

I mean, I don't

4

understand your brief from this point of view.

You were

5

talking about an antitrust analogy.

6

plaintiff in an antitrust case deliberately, to ruin his

7

competitor -- and no one doubts it -- files a case in the

8

court.

9

imagine or I haven't heard to date under the antitrust law

I mean, imagine a

Now, no matter how evil that person was, I can't

10

or any other law somebody who would sue the clerk of the

11

court because he docketed the -- he docketed the -- the

12

claim -- he docketed the complaint.

13

you've said, that's what's at issue here, that they're --

14

they're simply carry -- now, I -- I need some explanation.

15

I'm bringing it up because I'm quite honestly confused

16

about that part -MR. SALMONS:

17

And according to what

Yes -- yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your

18

Honor.

To be sure, the analogy to the Noerr-Pennington

19

line of cases is not perfect in this case, but it -- it -QUESTION:

20

I -- I bring it up because I'm

21

confused as to how in your mind you see this thing

22

working.

23

evil, horrible petition for a -- for a -- for a

24

referendum, a person still could make it and the person

25

who's in charge of carrying out the -- the non -- the

I -- I mean, I suppose if a city has a totally

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ministerial duties himself would not be sued even if that

2

person himself was evil.

3

what -- how does this all work in your mind?
MR. SALMONS:

4

So -- so what is the -- what --

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

5

approach that we recommend in our brief, Your Honor, is

6

that the Court undertake the question as to whether the

7

petitioning at issue was genuine or whether it was a sham.

8

That's the same type of analysis the Court has

9

undertaken -QUESTION:

10
11

evil.

Assume it's a sham.

It -- they're

They're horrible.

12

MR. SALMONS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

They're terrible.

I would think even

14

an evil, horrible, terrible person has the right to go to

15

the legislature and petition and that the clerks who are

16

to file that petition are themselves clerks, and they're

17

to do it even if they're evil themselves.

18

MR. SALMONS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

19

I think there are two ways in which the city could

20

potentially be held liable.

21

where the Court has to decide whether the city could ever

22

be held liable based on the discriminatory motives of the

23

referendum petitioners because it's clear in this case

24

that the petitioning was genuine and this isn't a sham.

25

QUESTION:

I think this is not a case

But what -- what --

1
2

MR. SALMONS:

But in the situation where you do

have a sham -QUESTION:

3

What -- what do you mean by saying

4

the petition was genuine as opposed to a sham in these --

5

in this context?
MR. SALMONS:

6

I -- I think genuine here means

7

the same it means in -- in the other contexts in which the

8

Court has used the sham doctrine, namely that it was about

9

the First Amendment activity.

10

The -- the process that --

that the city here -QUESTION:

11

I just -- this is such a strange

12

argument.

13

taken by means of a referendum, passed and became law?

14

Then wouldn't we be able to say that constitutes State

15

action at that point and you would subject it,

16

conceivably, to an equal protection analysis if the issue

17

is raised, and apply rational basis or whatever it is?

18

I don't understand why you ever get to this sham action

19

and Noerr-Pennington.

20

Why wouldn't we wait and see if some action was

MR. SALMONS:

Certainly, Your Honor, it -- in

21

the event that you have a referendum that's actually

22

enacted into law, the Court would examine it in the way

23

that -- that you have articulated.

24
25

We thought it was important to point out to the
Court that this process by which a city ordinance is, if

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you will, stayed pending resolution of the referendum vote

2

is a traditional and important part of the process for

3

referendums, but it is also a process that can give rise

4

to abuse if you have a petition that is a sham.

5

about the First Amendment process at all.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SALMONS:

8

QUESTION:

9

It's not

It's simply --

I don't --- taking advantage of the delay.

I don't know what you mean by abuse

in a situation like this.

I mean, presumably anybody has

10

a right to petition, and you know, the fact that maybe

11

they won't get the necessary votes surely doesn't make it

12

a sham.

13

MR. SALMONS:

That -- that is certainly true,

14

Your Honor.

15

back to the original question, what I'm trying to --

16

But -- but I think there are -- to -- to get

QUESTION:

The reason I'm worried, in about

17

2 minutes from now I'm going to hear the other side get

18

up, and they're going to say this is a sham.

19

I suspect.

20

relevance of this.

21

Okay?

Now, that's why I want to understand the

And I -- I come into this thinking if it's the

22

Nazis, the -- the most terrible racists that steal, the

23

most terrible people in the world, if they're Americans,

24

they can come in and they can vote and they can go to

25

their legislature and they can put anything they want on

2

charge of seeing that those things are voted on, that's

3

their job, they should do it, and if those are evil and

4

terrible and contrary to the Constitution, the courts will

5

strike them down when they get passed.
Now, what's -- now, you explain how your thing

6
7

fits into that.
MR. SALMONS:

8
9

And the -- the people who are mechanically in

Yes, Your Honor.

First of all,

let me just say that there's -- there would be -- need to

10

be both an objective and a subjective component to the

11

sham standard as there is in other contexts.

12

But to try and address the question that you

13

originally posed, it does seem to us that there are at

14

least two ways in which the city can be held liable in the

15

event that you have sham petitioning.

16

if the city officials themselves were part of the sham,

17

and the other would be --

One would be that

18

QUESTION:

Well, wait a -- what is --

We're trying to find out what is a

sham.

That's -- that's our basic problem.

In the antitrust context --

22

QUESTION:

You -- you haven't told us.

23

QUESTION:

In the antitrust context, I

24

understand it because -- because there is the law, and --

25

and you come up with a phony -- a phony law, you know, you

23
Alderson Reporting Company

can say it's a sham.

referendums.

3

like.

But there's no law about

You could have a referendum on anything you

How can you have a wrong referendum --

4

MR. SALMONS:

5

QUESTION:

6

doesn't make any sense to me.

-- and thus a sham referendum?

MR. SALMONS:

7

Well, Your Honor -It

Your Honor, this Court's sham

8

analysis has to do with whether or not it's actually about

9

the First Amendment activity or it's just about an effort,

10

in this case, to take advantage of the delay to interfere

11

with someone's housing rights.

12

analysis can apply here by inquiring as to whether, first

13

of all, the -- the referendum petition is objectively

14

baseless.

15

have -- be enacted into law and enforced?

We think that same

Is there any way that that petition could

If, for example, you had a petition that said no

16
17

minorities shall live in the City of Cuyahoga Falls,

18

clearly that's a referendum that could never go into

19

effect and never be enforced, and therefore, it may be

20

strong evidence that the process here is not about

21

changing a law of the city --

22

QUESTION:

So the clerk in that case -- the

23

clerk of the court who says I'm putting this on the

24

ballot -- he's violated the law in putting it on the

25

ballot?

Of course, if it's passed, it's totally

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unconstitutional.

But you're saying that the clerks

2

shouldn't even put that on the ballot?

3

be quite a novel proposition to me.
MR. SALMONS:

4

I mean, that would

Your Honor, I -- I'm not

5

necessarily saying that the clerk shouldn't put that on

6

the ballot, but that would be one part of the analysis in

7

determining whether or not the process was being abused

8

and it was just a sham.
QUESTION:

9

Well, isn't -- wouldn't it be a

10

sham -- let me just put this on the table.

11

understand it, the Ohio Supreme Court said that this was

12

not a legal referendum when it got all through with

13

things.

14

started that it was an illegal referendum, that would have

15

been a sham, wouldn't it?

16

As I

And if everybody had known before the -- the case

MR. SALMONS:

I -- I think that very well may be

17

strong evidence that it was a sham.

This was about an

18

attempt to abuse the process.

19

protected First Amendment activity.

20

situation I think there is, in -- in addition to the

21

possibility, although I think perhaps unlikely that you

22

can hold the city vicariously liable based on the motives

23

of the citizens, I think that is a difficult question as

24

to whether the actions of -- of the referendum -- the

25

petition signers, the 10 percent who signed the petition

It wasn't about any
And -- and in that

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and file it, whether that action is the official action of

2

the city with regard to the petition just as the action of

3

the voters at the referendum vote is an action of the city

4

for which the city can held liable.

5

address that in this case.
QUESTION:

6

This Court need not

May I ask your view on the

7

hypothetical I asked to the other lawyer?

Supposing it

8

was perfectly clear that the mayor and everybody else in

9

this used the referendum as a method of delaying a

10

granting of the permit and that they did so for racially

11

motivated reasons, would there be any -- any liability on

12

anybody?
MR. SALMONS:

13

Potentially, Your Honor.

I think,

14

again, the -- the way in which the analysis would work is

15

the Court would need to inquire as to whether the

16

petitioning was genuine in the sense that there was a

17

genuine effort to try and change the city's ordinance.

18

And if so, then the First Amendment would provide

19

immunity.

20

QUESTION:

Well, there was, but they -- they

21

figured it was going to lose in the long run, but

22

nevertheless, let's assume they wanted to delay things for

23

60, 90 days, whatever it might be, because they wanted to

24

delay it on -- on, you know, this -- this project.

25

MR. SALMONS:

Yes, Your Honor.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

If it -- if it were clear because

2

this case is on summary judgment, so really don't know

3

what the facts are --

4

MR. SALMONS:

5

QUESTION:

Well, but --

-- but if there were clear evidence

6

that the mayor and everybody else act up in a racially

7

motivated reason, would there be liability in that

8

situation?
MR. SALMONS:

9

I -- I think you'd need to examine

10

both the motives in -- in your hypothetical not only of

11

the city officials, but also of -- of the petition

12

signers.

13

QUESTION:

Everybody.

14

QUESTION:

Are you talking about personal

15

liability or official liability?

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SALMONS:

18
19
20
21

Everybody.

Liability -I'm talking about the liability of

the city, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Okay.

So you're talking about

liability -QUESTION:

I'm assuming everybody who opposed

22

the project was racially motivated and that could be

23

demonstrated with tape recorder.

24

MR. SALMONS:

25

I guess the short answer, Your

Honor, is that even people with racial motives have the

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

right to petition their government to change the law.

2

And -- but if they -- what no one has the right to do is

3

abuse the process in order to interfere with someone's

4

fair housing and equal protection rights.

5
6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

So -- so your answer would be no

liability in that case.
MR. SALMONS:

If it was genuine petitioning,

that is correct.
Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Kramer, we'll hear from you.

14

Thank you, Mr. Salmons.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. KRAMER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
QUESTION:

Mr. Kramer, opposing counsel says

that you have, in effect, abandoned the second question

presented, the disparate impact question.

17

or is it not correct?

18

MR. KRAMER:

Is that correct

It's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

We -- we have waived that claim that had been certified

20

by -- by this Court.

21

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

22

The city and the Solicitor General has tried to

injury that the plaintiff is complaining about?

The issues of liability in this case, which the

Sixth Circuit took up, was did the city and its officers

6

act out of discriminatory motive by delaying this housing

7

project and refusing to give effect to the site plan

8

ordinance to appease racial and anti-family prejudices in

9

violation of the Equal Protection Clause -QUESTION:

10

How could they do that if they had no

11

choice?

12

project once the referendum is filed, even if in -- in

13

their heart and -- heart of hearts they were delighted for

14

racial reasons that this was the case, nonetheless they

15

had no choice.

16

I mean, if the law told them you have to stop the

MR. KRAMER:

We believe that they did have a

17

choice and we cite cases to the Court from the Ohio

18

Supreme Court on page 25 of our brief that indicates that

19

the petitions did not have to be certified by the -- the

20

court -- by the city.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But didn't the lower -- the lower

courts didn't adopt that proposition, did they?
MR. KRAMER:

The lower courts weren't asked that

24

question, Your Honor, because we're really talking about

25

whether or not the -- there was an official conduct by the

that particular issue.

There was discretion, we believe,

and we certainly provided evidence.

12

is on summary judgment.

13

is an affidavit from the law director for the Village of

14

Orange that we filed with our brief in opposing summary

15

judgment that indicated that there was discretion not to

16

certify the referendum.

17
18

QUESTION:

And again, as -- as

For example, in the record, there

Well, but that -- that's a question

of Ohio law, I take it?

19

MR. KRAMER:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And the way you sought to prove it

21

was to get an affidavit from the law director of some

22

suburb of Cleveland?

23

MR. KRAMER:

As one element of proof, we

24

indicated that that showed that there was discretion.

25

the Ohio case law indicates there are instances where, if

many years after this case was -- went to litigation, did

Yes, Your Honor.
And it had nothing to do with whether

administrative or legislative.

MR. KRAMER:

13
14

It -- it had to do with was it

That's correct, and it also only

had -QUESTION:

Do you have -- do you have any -- do

15

you have any authority to say that there is discretion to

reject a petition that is properly legislative?

17

MR. KRAMER:

18

QUESTION:

Well, the -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.
Suppose -- suppose you had a

19

legislative proposal that members of a certain race will

20

never be included in any kind of an equal opportunity law.

21

Suppose you had -- that was the referendum.

22

authority that says that under Ohio law, that couldn't be

25

MR. KRAMER:

Is there any

I don't know of Ohio law, but

certainly this Court's decision in Hunter versus Erickson

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

dealing with an Ohio referendum indicates that that type

2

of referendum is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

3

Well now, I don't believe that's a

4

correct statement of the holding in Hunter.

5

Hunter, this Court said that a municipality cannot make

6

racial laws subject to referendum and no other laws, which

7

is quite a different proposition from what you suggest.
MR. KRAMER:

8
9

I thought in

Well, with -- Mr. Chief Justice, we

are talking about the -- this Court's jurisprudence that

10

deals with the -- simply because it's a referendum, if

11

the legislature could not do this, pass a law that says,

12

for example, that African-Americans cannot own property,

13

like in Buchanan versus Warley -QUESTION:

14

If a legislature could do that,

15

would -- would we enjoin a legislature from passing an

16

unconstitutional law?

MR. KRAMER:

QUESTION:

19

The Federal -- the Federal Congress

passes unconstitutional laws all the time.

We've -- we've never been asked to

enjoin them.

QUESTION:

So there's a difference between

2

whether the product is unconstitutional and whether the

3

doing of it is unconstitutional.

unconstitutional.

MR. KRAMER:

That's correct.
So -- so you've got your project.

Constitution in not giving you the permit quicker.

they -- am I right?

And

17

MR. KRAMER:

That's correct.

18

QUESTION:

19

And they come back and they say, how could we

All right.

20

give it to you quicker?

21

they -- a petition and the law prevents us from giving it

22

to you quicker because once a petition's on the ballot,

you the permit faster is because here's the provision of

10

the law.

11

and it says whether it's legal or illegal, we have to

12

delay this.

13

what should we have done that we didn't do once that

14

petition was filed.

15

It says once a petition for referendum is filed,

Now, your response to that is -- they say,

And your response is?

MR. KRAMER:

What should be done in a case like

16

this is that there is an injury to my client.

17

whether it was discretionary or non-discretionary, is --

18

is not the -- the question.

19

denying the building permit?

20

this Court has indicated one of the things that a court

21

can look at as competent evidence is did the city

22

officials take action to appease racial bias.

23

was a nondiscretionary act, if the effect of that was to

24

permit private bias, they've committed a violation.

If -- if

1

I have a -- you know, I'm -- I'm a racist and it really

2

makes me happy that this act, which I'm compelled to do by

3

law, hurts someone of a certain race, that renders that

4

act invalid even though I'm compelled to do it by law?

5

I don't think so.
MR. KRAMER:

6

What we're saying is that it may

7

not be invalid, but it may cause liability.

9

All right.

It can be a

So what I'm hearing you

10

saying -- what I'm hearing you saying in response to my

11

question is, I'm the mayor and the other, and I say, what

12

do you want me to do?

13

the permit because the petition has been filed.

14

could I have done?

15

seems to be, nothing.

16

We agree.

The statute said, don't give you
What

And your answer to that basically
You couldn't have done anything.

But the petition itself was an evil petition.

17

QUESTION:

Right.

18

QUESTION:

I mean evil being quotes for what we

19
20

all know is going on.

All right?

So it's an evil petition.

And therefore, when

21

you face this evil petition, even though you couldn't do

22

anything about it, you have to pay damages because the

23

reason we were delayed was because of that process.

24

is that basically your argument?

25

MR. KRAMER:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

We're --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Now,

1

we're saying that even if it was a legal thing to do, if

2

the act of it was because of racial or anti-family bias,

3

that would be a violation of the -QUESTION:

4

And now, the reason that that bothers

5

me, of course, is because I can think of a whole range of

6

evil legislative acts, and I can think of quasi-acts that

7

I'm not sure about, and then I can think of a lot of ones

8

I like.

9

first category and the second category, once we got into

10

the business of paying damages, because it turns out that

11

they are evil, that would, in fact, chill the legislative

12

process, which is a democratic process.

13

that's the argument they're trying to make.

14

to get your response to that.

15

All right.

So -- so -- but I'm worried.

MR. KRAMER:

In the

And I think
So I'd like

What I would say, Justice Breyer,

16

is that the fact that there was an evil motive behind any

17

of these acts -- and by the way, the referendum is only

18

the culmination of the acts.

19

discretionary acts.

20

was to do two things.

21

because they knew that there was a -- a very finite period

22

of time for our little non-profit tax-exempt developer to

23

build this project or lose their financing.

24

the longer they could delay, the more likely the project

25

would die.

There was a series of

For example, the strategy of the city

So they knew

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And second of all, they wanted to make the

2

project more costly.

3

before we even talked about a referendum, a barrier wall

4

to be built before even a building permit that could be

5

issued, a 6-foot earthen wall with a 5-foot fence between

6

two conforming multi-family projects.
QUESTION:

So, for example, they required,

Your client agreed to that.

Your

client didn't make any objection to that.
MR. KRAMER:

9

My client was willing to do that

10

because he was told by the city it would smooth the

11

process over.

He certainly did not waive his rights.

And in the depositions, the planning

12
13

commissioner, Louis Sharpe, specifically testified the

14

reason he was demanding that was because our project was

15

going to have a large number of children.

may well violate the protection against -- against

with -- with it.

Precisely how does it figure in your

MR. KRAMER:

It's the latter, Justice Souter.

12

We're saying that the referendum, which was part of an

13

overall scheme by city officials to delay this project so

14

that it would kill it.

15

talking about from -- from the referendum deals with the

16

city officials using that as the legal shred to be able to

17

deny the building permits.

18

that we have proffered to the Court through the summary

19

judgment motion is that there was not only citizen bias,

20

which under Arlington Heights, this Court has indicated we

certainly can allow -- it's competent evidence that can be

looked at of whether or not legislators used that bias to

23

be able to take that action.

MR. KRAMER:

Am I -- am I wrong on that?

MR. KRAMER:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

We -- we

2

believe we indicated that this was not something that the

3

city responded from -- responded to from their citizens,

4

but this was a scheme where city officials, including

5

Mayor Robart with other private citizens, got together and

6

said, how can we deny this project.
QUESTION:

7

But you've lost on that and didn't

8

appeal it.

I mean, he'd be a very bad man for doing that,

9

and you might have a cause of action against him.

But I

10

don't see any official city action involved in that.

11

Is it official city action for the -- for the mayor to

stimulate a referendum?
MR. KRAMER:

13

How is that official city action?
And we're not talking about that

14

that's something that caused a damage.

15

about is, is there evidence that we can use to show that

MR. KRAMER:

QUESTION:

7

9

I understand the analogy.
So what do you -- what do you -- what

do you say about that?
MR. KRAMER:

The difference, Justice Breyer, is

that the -- we are asking only for the Court to look at

10

the issue of has the plaintiffs proffered sufficient

11

evidence that racial bias and anti-family bias was

12

involved in the decision to deny the building permit.

13

The referendum was part of the -- an overall scheme by

14

city officials to delay and ultimately kill this project.

15

If that is the case, then the referendum, which Ohio

16

Supreme Court has ruled was illegal to begin with -- even

17

if it was legal, we believe under your jurisprudence if

18

the motivation of the city to use the referendum was

19

unlawful, the violation occurs under the Fourteenth

20

Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.

21

With regards to your question about the

22

regulatory taking, we saw this -- this case under a due

23

process -- substantive due process, procedural due

24

process -- examination very similar, I think, to the

25

situation that's actually the exact opposite to the City

of Eastlake versus Forest City case, which Justice Stevens

is the only participating member that was on that

1

QUESTION:

It's fundamental --

2

MR. KRAMER:

-- about a reasonable period.

3

We're talking about both -- we had raised both procedural

4

and substantive due process claims in the lower courts.

5

What we're saying is the process was so fundamentally

6

flawed that it rises to a -- a due process violation.

7

Whether it's substantive or procedural, we don't believe

8

is -- is really the issue here.

9

We're talking about a process where there was a

10

whole set of procedures set up by the City of Cuyahoga

11

Falls of how to approve this site plan ordinance.

12

the site plan procedures were set forth, permitted for a

13

record to be developed, and there was a -- planning

14

commission meetings.

15

And if the city council or the planning commission had

16

denied our right to the site plan ordinance and its

17

benefits, we would have had a right under Ohio law to go

18

under the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and get a

19

court to review that issue.

20

QUESTION:

The --

There was the city council meetings.

Because there would have been

21

official action.

And that's the problem here, that

22

there -- do you -- do you call a referendum that's put on

23

the ballot because 10 percent of the electorate had signed

24

petitions -- do you call that State action, which is

25

subject to the equal protection surveillance?

I had

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thought that that's a -- that's an initiative of the

2

people and it's not action of the city.

3

MR. KRAMER:

Well, the only reason why the

4

people are able to get a referendum is because the city

5

charter, which is their constitution, permitted that.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

But that permitted it 30 years ago,

did it not?
MR. KRAMER:

That's right, but in the -- the due

process area, Your Honor, we're not talking about

10

discriminatory intent.

11

at whether the procedure set forth is fundamentally flawed

12

and does it -- is it arbitrary and capricious and not

13

substantially related to the general welfare as -- as this

14

Court has talked about ever since --

15

QUESTION:

All we're talking about is looking

But there are all kinds of nutty

theory would seem to subject a State or a city or whatever

18

it is to a lawsuit every time there's one of these nutty

19

proposals put forward.

20

MR. KRAMER:

No.

I -- your

We're talking about whether

21

you have to have a -- a protected property interest and

22

you also have to have a situation where there is a

23

arbitrary and capricious action.

24
25

In this case, we have ownership of property,
which under the original intention of -- of the Framers of

2

ability to develop using this property for a lawful

3

purpose is protected by the Due Process Clause.

4

you look at the issue -QUESTION:

5

And when

But your theory, as I understand it,

6

is that there was -- if it was racially motivated, there

7

was just sort of an arbitrary.

8

legitimate reason for the delays and the shenanigans and

9

so forth.

There was an absence of a

But it seemed to me the same argument could --

10

could be made if they were trying to protect the wetlands,

11

and they used the same kind of shenanigans.

12

MR. KRAMER:

Well, Your Honor, we certainly

13

raised the question about if this was a discriminatory

14

motive, that would mean that there would not be -- under

15

general welfare.

16

QUESTION:

There would be no racial basis.

17

MR. KRAMER:

But more importantly, our argument

18

is that there is a per se violation whenever you have an

19

administrative matter which should be taken up through the

20

city council or through the courts or through a -- from --

21

from an administrative agency like the planning

22

commission.

23

And the evidence in the record, as the lower

24

courts point out, is that we met all the requirements for

25

the city to -- to get our site plan.

And then, when the

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

city council approved it, when the planning director said

2

we met or exceeded the site plan ordinance, they put it to

3

a referendum and they asked 20,000 voters to approve or

4

disapprove a site plan ordinance, they never saw and

5

the -- and whether or not that site plan ordinance

6

conformed to the building and zoning code that they never

7

read.

8
9

If that is not -QUESTION:

No.

But what your -- what your

argument boils down to is to say that there is a

10

recoverable substantive due process violation whenever a

11

property right of yours is interfered with by a misuse of

12

the legislative process, even a temporary one.

13

the -- the nub of your claim?

You never mentioned procedural due

MR. KRAMER:

The first mention I heard of it is

Your brief went

Well, the reason that we didn't

MR. NAGER:

With respect to the disparate impact claim, I

10

would just like to clarify that we were the petitioners,

11

and the Court did grant certiorari on the issue and there

12

is a judgment of the Sixth Circuit against my clients on
