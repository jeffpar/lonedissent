CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Taggart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. TAGGART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

There are three reasons Congress did not validly

12

abrogate State immunity when it adopted the Family Medical

13

Leave Act's family leave provision.

14

everyday economic legislation, a national labor standard,

15

not antidiscrimination legislation, second, Congress was

16

not responding to a discernible pattern of

17

unconstitutional behavior, and third, even if such a

18

pattern were discernible, the 12-week family leave mandate

19

enforced by abrogating State immunity is not a

20

proportional and congruent response.

21

First, the FMLA is

The Family Medical Leave Act is no different

22

than the minimum wage and other national labor standards.

23

It is, in its operation and effect, it is simply Commerce

24

Clause legislation.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but now in the statute, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

findings, or the beginning, they refer to the Equal -- the

2

Equal Protection Clause.

3

the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,

4

don't they?
MR. TAGGART:

5

They say it's consistent with

Yes, they do, but they do not --

6

Congress did not invoke Section 5 of the Fourteenth

7

Amendment, as it did in the ADA and the ADEA statutes.

8

told us exactly why, in the House and Senate reports, it

9

was mentioning the Fourteenth Amendment in the text of the

10

It

statute.
QUESTION:

11

Well, as applied to private

12

employers, I suppose Congress had to rely on Commerce

13

Clause powers, but as applied to States, there is specific

14

reference in the statute, of course, to section 5 -- to

15

equal protection.

16

MR. TAGGART:

17

to equal protection --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. TAGGART:

Yes, there is specific reference

Yes, right.
-- but Congress told us why they

20

mentioned equal protection in the House and the Senate

21

report, where Congress stated that if -QUESTION:

22

Why do you need the House and Senate

23

report?

I mean, the very text of the statute doesn't say,

24

in order to assure equal protection of the laws in the

25

States.

That's not what it says.

It says that what we're

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

doing, what we're requiring, the leave that we're

2

requiring, we are requiring in a manner that, consistent

3

with the Equal Protection Clause, minimizes the

4

protection, the potential for employment discrimination.

5

I read that as saying what we're doing here is

6

being done with an eye to being sure that it's in

7

conformance with the Equal Protection Clause.

8

quite different from saying that we're doing it in order

9

to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, which is being

10
11
12

That's

violated by the States.
MR. TAGGART:

We agree with that position,

Justice Scalia.

13

QUESTION:

But Mr. Taggart, we --

14

QUESTION:

But the statement in the text goes to

15
16
17

the manner, goes to the manner, not to the purpose at all.
QUESTION:

The first rule of statutory

construction is to read on, and if you read on with me --

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

you will find it said, to promote

--

20

the role of equal employment opportunity for women and men

21

pursuant to such clause, to promote the goal of equal

22

opportunity for women and men.

23

Throughout your opening brief, you never

24

referred to that statute.

You told us there was only the

25

(4), the one that Justice Scalia referred to, and it

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

wasn't until your reply brief that you even acknowledged

2

that Congress has said, we're doing this to promote the

3

goal of equal opportunity for men and women.

4

you mention (5) in your opening brief?

5

MR. TAGGART:

Why didn't

Well, why we didn't mention (5),

6

I -- I apologize if we did not -- if we did not mention

7

it, but the -- the Senate report and the House report

8

describe exactly why Congress was talking about equal

9

protection.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, one would look to the statute

before one looks to the House or the Senate report.
MR. TAGGART:

Yes, that is correct, but the

13

operation of the statute clearly shows that it is just

14

everyday Commerce Clause legislation.

15

concerned that the Family Medical Leave Act itself would

16

be challenged on equal protection grounds, and that's why

17

it said it was promoting the goal of equal employment

18

opportunity.

19

it operates, the economic benefit that it provides, the

20

fact that it doesn't prohibit discrimination at all, show

21

that this is nothing different from the minimum wage, and

22

that -- that is what -- that is what this -- this was

23

adopted in the tradition of.

24

QUESTION:

25

Congress was deeply

Everything else about the statute, the way

Mr. Taggart, I -- I thought the

reason you didn't refer to the reference to equal

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

opportunity for men and women is that that is not a

2

reference to the Equal Protection Clause.

3

QUESTION:

Pursuant to such clause --

4

QUESTION:

People -- people -- people --

5

individuals could fail to provide equal -- equal

6

opportunity for men and women without violating the Equal

7

Protection Clause.

8

MR. TAGGART:

9

QUESTION:

10

the Equal Protection Clause.

11

That's true, but the --

The -- the statute says, pursuant to

MR. TAGGART:

Well, it does say that, but in our

12

view, it is more important to look at the operation and

13

the text of the amendment, and how -- how the -- or of the

14

act, and how the act works.

15

QUESTION:

Why?

If you're looking at the text,

16

then just a few lines above, in the text, where it talks

17

about findings, it says that, due to the nature of the

18

roles of men and women, primary responsibility for family

19

care-taking often falls on women, and then it says

20

employment standards that apply to just one gender have

21

serious potential for encouraging employers to

22

discriminate against people of that gender.

23

take that to mean is that, without this, State employers

24

as well as others tend to say to the woman, You go take

25

care of your sick mother, and because employers know that,

So what I

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they won't hire women.

2

(6), and I would have thought that sounded like equal

3

protection of the laws, as if this statute is designed to

4

help remove one of the major reasons why employers

5

discriminate against women.

6

and then the -- 10 lines down it says, pursuant to the

7

Fourteenth Amendment.

8
9

MR. TAGGART:

That's what it says in (5) and

That's what (5) and (6) says,

Well, Justice Breyer, the

statement here, in our view, indicates why Congress

10

adopted a gender-neutral statute.

11

specific statute, the statute itself would have been

12

subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.

13

If it adopted a gender-

Our -- our concern here is that any everyday

14

economic legislation that may have a disparate benefit to

15

one suspect classification or another will all of a sudden

16

be -- have the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment

17

immunity, and then State immunity will be subject to

18

abrogation at -- at any expense where Congress deems that

19

Commerce Clause legislation is appropriate.

20

should not be allowed to do indirectly what it's

21

prohibited from doing directly.

22

QUESTION:

Congress

Mr. Taggart, would you comment on

23

this argument, which I think is really an elaboration on

24

the findings in the purpose statement that Justice Breyer

25

was referring to.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I think you can distill those statements down to

2

something like this.

We know for a fact historically

3

that, whenever burdens of family responsibility are

4

allocated, they are allocated to the woman, not to the

5

man.

6

expressly says you have got to treat them exactly alike,

7

the women will always get the short end, and that will be

8

reflected in hiring decisions, among others.

If we do not have an employment standard that

9

Secondly, in order to make this determination a

10

practical one, we can't simply leave it that whatever you

11

do for men you should do for women, or vice versa.

12

got to put some kind of a threshold there that will mean

13

something, and so we've come up with a particular period,

14

a particular number of weeks.

15

this work.

16

effect, on these two sections.

17

like simply an end run, a phony Commerce Clause argument.

18

Would you comment on that argument?

19

We've

That's the only way to make

I think that is the argument that is based, in

MR. TAGGART:

That doesn't sound to me

Well, even if that were true, even

20

if that effect occurred from the statute, the failure, the

21

utter failure of the statute to satisfy this Court's City

22

of Boerne test shows that it is purely economic

23

legislation.

24

Congress regarding State conduct, or whether State conduct

25

was unconstitutional, and it's difficult to discern from

There were absolutely no findings by

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the record before this Court or -QUESTION:

2

Well, given the fact that we have

3

accepted in prior cases the pervasiveness of the

4

phenomenon that seems to be quite clearly reflected in the

5

findings and purpose, is that necessary here to say, well,

6

yeah, it -- we've already said, the Supreme Court has

7

already accepted its pervasiveness, but we've got to go a

8

step further and say, well, yeah, that pervasiveness even

9

goes to States.

10

has been made?

Isn't there a point at which the point

MR. TAGGART:

11

Well, first of all, if that were

12

true, then any law that Congress passes that has any

13

arguable fact on discrimination based on gender would be

14

sufficient for satisfying an abrogation of State immunity.

15

In 1993 -QUESTION:

16

Well, we can't -- what about the

17

Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court

18

unanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the

19

Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into

20

the history of gender discrimination, it was just

21

accepted?

22

under your analysis?

23
24
25

Do you think that that case would stand up

MR. TAGGART:

Yes, it would.

would take the position that it would.
QUESTION:

There -- or we
There is --

Because this is rather similar.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. TAGGART:

Well, there is no requirement, and

2

we are not urging the Court to adopt a requirement that

3

Congress make findings.

4

when it makes findings about what it is -- whether there

5

is unconstitutional State behavior that would justify a

6

12-week family leave benefit that's abrogated by State

7

sovereign immunity.

8

this Court's section 1 jurisprudence, and there's every

9

reason to believe that Title VII would stand up to the

Congress simply helps the Court

But Title VII is closely hewed to

10

City of Boerne test.

11

is that there is absolutely --

12

QUESTION:

So the difference with this statute

Mr. Taggart, I thought that part of

13

your argument was, if the discrimination doesn't exist

14

anymore in the State, even if it did at one time, then the

15

provision would have to sunset, and as far as Title VII is

16

concerned, many States, the vast majority of States have

17

their own Title VII laws, so at this point in time I

18

guess, under your reasoning, Fitzpatrick and Bitzer would

19

have to go.

20

MR. TAGGART:

Well, we are not arguing that

21

position and, in fact, in our view Title VII is so closely

22

hewed to this Court's section (1) jurisprudence that it --

23

it -- there's every reason to believe that it would

24

satisfy this Court's test.

25

In -- in -- in this case, though, the question

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is, in 1993 was there a pattern and practice of State

2

behavior that would justify a 12-week mandatory family

3

leave benefit for all State employees that's -- that's

4

enforced through abrogating State immunity, and the

5

standard -QUESTION:

6

What was the -- in the title of Title

7

VII what was the pattern and practice that justified that

8

result, because when the original Title VII was passed

9

this Court had never declared any law that differentiated

10

on the basis of gender unconstitutional, and when it was

11

extended to public employees -- was it in '72? -- this

12

Court had just begun to address the issue.

13

MR. TAGGART:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, that --

And yet the Court said Congress could

15

do that in '72 with no special record of any kind.

16

record, to the extent it existed, was made for race, not

17

sex.
MR. TAGGART:

18
19

VII in this case.

20

the --

21
22

Well, we're not challenging Title

We're challenging that in 1993, when

QUESTION:

But she's asking you to distinguish

Title VII from this.

We know you're not challenging it.

23

MR. TAGGART:

24

QUESTION:

25

The

Well, in our view --

What about the fact that Title VII

goes to discrimination on the basis of sex in general, and

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there was no doubt that States have engaged in that and

2

were engaging in it at the time.

You could have said it

3

was -- it was general knowledge.

But the statute we're

4

construing here doesn't go to sex discrimination in

5

general, it goes to a very particular type of sex

6

discrimination, and that is in the granting of leave, and

7

on that, at least I can't say as a matter of general

8

knowledge that the States were in violation of provisions

9

of leave.

I've no idea what the state -- what the state

10

was.

11

were violating that particular aspect of -- of -- of equal

12

protection.

13

Certainly you -- you need evidence to show that they

MR. TAGGART:

Well, in order to show a pattern

14

and practice in 1993 it's this Court's section (1)

15

jurisprudence on violations of the Equal Protection Clause

16

that governs, and Washington v. Davis, incorporated into

17

the gender cases through State Administrators v. Feeney,

18

is a test which requires purposeful and invidious

19

discrimination.

20

pattern and practice of State managers in 1993 of using a

21

gender stereotype when they granted leave.

22

There's no showing that there was a

QUESTION:

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, because if

23

you accept, I take it, you accept the proposition that

24

Congress has sufficiently shown, as far as anyone need do,

25

that State employers discriminated in their hiring against

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

women, the gener -- you accept that, is that right?

2

That's your -- your -- your -- your, for -- because if

3

that's not so, I guess goodbye to Title VII, a whole bunch

4

of things, but is -- do you accept that?
MR. TAGGART:

5

Well, Title VII, and the circuits

6

have said this already, is that Title VII is so closely

7

hewed to this Court's section (1) -QUESTION:

8
9

Title VII.

No, I'm not asking you to distinguish

I'm asking you if, for purposes of this case,

10

you accept the proposition that it is adequately shown

11

that State employers, like a lot of other employers, did

12

discriminate against women in hiring people, in general.

13

MR. TAGGART:

14

QUESTION:

15

I'd like a yes answer or a no answer,

if I could.
MR. TAGGART:

16
17

If --

Well, a qualified yes if you're

talking about 1972, when --

18

QUESTION:

Okay, so at the time of this statute?

19

MR. TAGGART:

20

QUESTION:

Not at the time of this statute.

Oh, okay.

You do not accept the

21

proposition that it is adequately shown that State

22

employers discriminated against women when they passed

23

this law?

24

MR. TAGGART:

25

QUESTION:

No, and even if there was a --

Okay.

No, then, I don't see the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

distinction with Title VII.

2

argument, I think.

3

It's goodbye if I accept that

It's just that it was earlier?

MR. TAGGART:

No, it's that title -- it's

4

unclear whether Title VII even prohibits things that this

5

Court's section (1) jurisprudence wouldn't also prohibit.

6

Title VII basically codifies what this Court

7

said in Washington v. Davis.

It allows a give-and-take in

8

the courtroom of the evidence to -- to flesh out the

9

totality of facts that surround an employment activity,

10

and at the end of the day in the Title VII lawsuit an

11

inference can be made of whether purposeful discrimination

12

actually occurred.

13

heightened scrutiny or strict scrutiny.

14

simple defense by the employer.

15

It allows a defense not based upon
It allows just a

Unlike the Family Medical Leave Act, which just

16

takes away any defense at all for States to defend the

17

policies that they have, that it doesn't even elevate

18

State policies to a heightened scrutiny standard, but in

19

1993 State policies were gender neutral, and under this

20

Court's section (1) jurisprudence those policies should be

21

subject to a rational basis review.

22

just makes all of those policies unlawful.

23

that doesn't have 12 weeks of leave is simply unlawful.

24

It doesn't give the State the ability to come in and prove

25

that that policy was -- was applied --

But instead, the FMLA

QUESTION:

Suppose you have two statutes, one is

2

a congressional statute that says, all States must have

3

employment and pay policies that do not differentiate on

4

the basis of gender, and the second is the FMLA.

5

to me that the FMLA is much more limited.

6

weeks, the damages are capped, it's simple to operate --

7

MR. TAGGART:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

It seems

It's just 12

But --

I would think that that is much more

proportional and congruent than the other statute that I
described.
MR. TAGGART:

Well, the -- this statute, in

12

our -- our position is is not proportionally concurrent,

13

because first, there's no pattern of State behavior that

14

would justify a 12-week leave benefit.

15

make unlawful any act, any State policy that's less than

16

12 weeks would require a substantial showing that States

17

were engaged in discrimination in the employment, in

18

employment practices.

19

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

But to completely

Because if you imagined,

20

and you won't concede this, but I think, take it as a

21

hypothetical, then, if you imagined that State employers

22

had been shown to discriminate against women in hiring,

23

wouldn't Congress have quite a lot of leeway in choosing

24

the remedy for that discrimination, and wouldn't this

25

statute be part of the remedy?

2

MR. TAGGART:

Absolutely.

If your

hypothetical -QUESTION:

3

So in other words, if it's

4

absolutely, then the answer as far as you see it in this

5

case is whether there has been an adequate showing that at

6

the time of this statute State employers discriminated

7

against women in hiring, and if the answer to that

8

question in your view is, there was an adequate showing,

9

this is an appropriate remedy, but if the answer in your

10

view is, it wasn't an adequate showing, then, of course,

11

you would win.

case.

14

That's how you're basically seeing the

MR. TAGGART:

you 100 percent, but -- but the --

15

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

17

Well, I don't want to agree with

I would think your-- your brief --

your brief agreed with him zero percent.

MR. TAGGART:

19

(Laughter.)

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. TAGGART:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

Your -- your -We didn't --

Under your brief, the answer is quite

23

MR. TAGGART:

Well, the hypothetical was, if

there was enough of a showing, and I think that's the

question.

justify no remedy, but even if there was a showing, the

5

remedy has to be proportional, and this 12-week leave

6

benefit just goes far out of proportion of any discernible

7

pattern of conduct by States which would justify it.

We argue there was no showing, which would

QUESTION:

8

Mr. Taggart, there have been scores

9

of Title VII cases where there's a nice, neutral standard,

10

and then there's a decision maker, and the decision maker

11

is exercising discretion under these general standards.

12

And time after the time, the decision maker is duplicating

13

himself, whether race, sex, and the people who don't look

14

like the decision maker say, gee, we suspect

15

discrimination.
There have been countless Title VII suits that

16
17

have prevailed on that, that the standards are nice and

18

neutral, but the discretion whether to hire is made by

19

someone who is coming up with results that exclude these

20

people.

21

Now, do you think that State employers, that the

22

people who do hiring and promotions for States are so

23

nonbiased, so unprejudiced that that doesn't affect the

24

decision makers on the State level, as opposed to the

25

municipal level, and in private employment?

MR. TAGGART:

Our position is that the

2

presumption has to be that States act in a constitutional

3

manner, and I'm not going to stand here before the Court

4

and say that States are perfect, but there's certainly no

5

pattern which would justify a 12-week mandatory family

6

leave benefit enforced through the abrogation of State

7

immunity.

8

any -- any pattern of State conduct.

9

This -- the FMLA is simply not based upon

The Congress knew in 1993 that 30 States had

10

laws just like the Family Medical Leave Act.

11

wasn't thinking about whether States were violating law

12

and whether States needed to be corrected.

trying to supplement what States were already doing with

14

the leave benefit.

question before Justice Scalia did.

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

The difference between the case I

4

just put to you and the case that we've got here is 12

5

weeks, and I suggested that one reason for the 12 weeks is

6

a decision on the part of Congress that if we don't put

7

some period of time, some threshold period of time, our

8

nondiscrimination standard isn't going to be worth

9

anything.

10

For example, just outside this case, the States

11

could say, okay, we're going to give a 1-week maternity

12

leave, men or women.

Obviously, that isn't going to

13

accomplish anything.

So Congress says, we've got to have

14

some kind of a threshold in order to make this requirement

15

of neutrality really work.

16

way to get to the point which I think we both agree would

17

be a perfectly lawful exercise of power under section (5)?

18

MR. TAGGART:

Why is that not a reasonable

Well, first on the latter part, a

19

prohibition or a requirement for gender-neutral leave

20

would -- for -- if leave is allowed, it must be allowed on

21

a gender-neutral basis, I would still argue that that

22

would be, that would require some predicate of a pattern

23

of unconstitutional behavior, but --

Okay.

We'll take that as a given.

You don't concede that.

MR. TAGGART:

that is not why it used 12 weeks.

MR. TAGGART:

No, and it -- first it's --

Doesn't it seem plausible, however,

that the period of time was designed in view of the

applied to the Government, just as reasonable or

7

unreasonable, however you come out, as it is when it's

8

applied to private industry?

9

MR. TAGGART:

Isn't that a fair argument?

No, because it's not so simple as

10

to draw the conclusions about the society in general

11

directly to States and impute States with unconstitutional

12

behavior without presuming first that States act in a

13

constitutional way.

No, I recognize that you're not

conceding the -- the -- the point that a predicate for

applying it to the States, even a -- a -- a non-6-weeks

different for States from the appropriate --

appropriateness of the means with respect to private

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T. L. PILLARD

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MS. PILLARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Family Medical Leave Act is an appropriate

16

response to enduring problems of State sex discrimination

17

bias against women in hiring and promotion because

18

employers assume that women are more likely than men to

19

leave their jobs to go take care of their family members,

20

and bias against men in the dispensing of family leave.

21

Congress gathered ample recent evidence of these

22

mutually reinforcing problems, and Congress also built on

23

a known foundation of State laws and decisions fostering

24

different roles for men and women in work and family.

25

Those different roles and beliefs about them persist.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Offering a threshold amount of leave to men and

2

women alike is responsive to the problems.

The act has

3

successfully encouraged more men to take the leave, and in

4

narrowing the gap between men's and women's leave rates,

5

the act erodes the very basis of employers' bias against

6

women.

unattractive.

MS. PILLARD:

and, in fact, the bare prohibition against discrimination

13

in the dispensing of leave had been in place.

quite a different thing.

I'm trying to figure out -- what you're

I mean, does one have to think that parenting
leave, which is the ability to go home and take care of a

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

child, is the same as allowing a woman who's just gone

2

through childbirth some leave to recuperate from the

3

childbirth?

4

It just proves that some States had a policy of maternity

5

leave, and presumably if, you know, if one of their male

6

employees gave birth they'd give him maternity leave, too.

I don't think that proves anything at all.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MS. PILLARD:

9

Justice Scalia, let me clarify,

each of these studies and all the figures that I'm citing

10

are not talking about pregnancy disability leave.

11

talking about maternity leave over and above pregnancy

12

disability leave, so we're talking about whether it's

13

unconstitutional for a State to assume that women and not

14

men can appropriately go home and take --

15

18

We're talking about both.

Part of

19

the medical leave provision allows parents to take care of

20

their seriously ill children as well as their spouses or

21

parents, and Congress saw these as part and parcel of the

22

same phenomenon.

23

QUESTION:

Did any State have parenting leave

24

laws which say, we just want you to have time to take care

25

of your family, which applied only to men -- only to women

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and not to men?

2

MS. PILLARD:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, all --

I know plenty of States had maternity

4

leave.

5

Were there any States that had parenting leave, time to

6

take care of your family, that applied only to women and

7

not to men?

8

I consider that a different category entirely.

MS. PILLARD:

Justice Scalia, each of these

9

States, when they called it maternity leave, the important

10

distinction is that it encompassed but was not restricted

11

to a period of pregnancy disability.

12

We're talking about, for example, in our lodging

13

appendix at page 31, the Rhode Island agreement that

14

applied from 1992 to 1995.

15

leave is available for up to a year, without regard to

16

pregnancy disability.

17

our lodging, maternity leaves not to exceed 6 months, but

18

may be extended, and paternity leaves are available for 3

19

months, so someone -- a woman can take a maternity leave

20

up to a year without a showing of maternity disability,

21

and a man can take 3 months.

22

lodging, again the Pennsylvania agreement says that women

23

can take a period of 6 months, and it may be extended for

8

That's the same thing.

It's precisely these assumptions

10

that have caused State employers and other employers to

13

these are really two sides of the same coin.

And the act

Would the act be any less valid if we

were to conclude it weren't working?
MS. PILLARD:

19

No, but I think the point is that

there's an ongoing problem, and that Congress was correct

21

in discerning that this was really at the core of the

problem.

11

12

this constitutional problem?

13

Why -- why wouldn't that have been a proportionate

MS. PILLARD:

Why --

Justice Scalia, that prohibition

14

was already in place from 1972, and the problem also is

15

that a bare prohibition against discrimination cannot

16

respond to discrimination against men in the dispensing of

17

leave, because in the real world a facially neutral policy

18

without a threshold leave entitlement really equates to a

19

discretionary practice of dispensing leave tainted by

20

stereotypes about who should need it.

21

QUESTION:

I don't understand what you said.

22

MS. PILLARD:

Even if employers do not

23

affirmatively provide for any leave, they equally have a

24

no-leave policy for men and women that is formally equal.

25

In the real world, some workers ask for leave and some do

discretion we open the door --

-- to discrimination.

But where -- is it supervisor

6

discretion?

You -- the supervisor cannot discriminate on

7

the basis of sex.

8

without this 12-week period, many men just wouldn't take

9

the leave.

I think what you're saying is that

That's probably right, but then many men

10

wouldn't necessarily take the 12-week leave either, if

11

it's available.

12

MS. PILLARD:

Many men would be deterred, if

13

they didn't have an affirmative right to take the leave,

14

by the assumption that their employers would not grant

15

them leave if they requested it, by the assumption that

16

they would be retaliated against in the employment process

17

if they took it, because it is still much more

18

unacceptable for men to take family leave than for women.

MS. PILLARD:

So the question is, why damages?

Once Congress has found a problem, a serious problem of

10

unconstitutional discrimination, that we assert exists

11

here, the standard remedy to enforce rights in the

12

employment context is make whole monetary relief, the

13

centerpiece of which is lost wages.

14

damages, the Equal Pay Act uses damages, and here, in the

15

Family Medical Leave Act, these are limited damages.

16

Congress took great care to ensure that they wouldn't

17

overburden the States --

18

QUESTION:

Title VII uses

I understand that, but it seems to me

19

if there's a big problem you can have an Ex Parte Young

20

suit or, if the Government just is -- the United States is

21

concerned about this, the Government of the United States

22

can intervene, and why isn't that wholly adequate --

23

MS. PILLARD:

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. PILLARD:

Congress determined --

-- to enforce this law?
Congress considered very carefully

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that damages were needed, and limited the damages.

2

They're just enough to spur enforcement and not burden

3

employers, including the States.

4

to make sure cases get the attention of higher-ups in

5

State government as well as in private industry.

You need money damages

States at the highest levels may be fully

6
7

responsive, but the application of stereotypes is

8

typically at the lower level of the supervisor with

9

hiring, promotion, and assignment discretion, the line

10

supervisor in the State university, in the State hospital,

11

in the State troopers, in the State human services

12

agencies, like where Mr. Hibbs worked, and without the

13

clear commitment by Congress that a threshold of family

14

leave is going to be made available not on an ad hoc

15

basis, not according to supervisor decisions about who

16

really needs the leave, but because Federal law requires

17

it as a remedy for past discrimination.

18

that message really reach the line supervisors who are

19

making these decisions.

Only then will

So I would emphasize that the act is working,

20
21

the damages are limited, and the problems at which it aims

22

are clearly unconstitutional, and petitioners are just

23

wrong that there was no evidence in the legislative

24

record.

25

problems of the States as on a par with problems of other

Congress clearly identified the problems, the

Congress was well aware of the body of recent

3

judicial decisions, finding State sex discrimination in

4

employment.

5

our brief at footnote 23.

6

some examples of the most recent cases in their brief at

7

note 15 and, as I was discussing before, Congress learned

8

of the patterns of States granting leave to women but not

9

to men, and Congress saw the family medical issue as part

11

responsibilities, family care responsibilities

12

traditionally performed by wives.

13

in subsections (a), (b), and (c) at a common problem of

14

employers' assumptions of women taking leave burdening

15

their employment prospects, and employers' assumptions

16

that men did not need the leave, hindering their ability

17

to take it, which in turn exacerbates the discrimination

18

problem against -- against women.

19

These were all

And so Congress aimed

So denial of employment opportunity to women and

20

of family leave to men are two sides of the same coin.

21

Congress clearly identified the problems, had facts

showing that they continued.

on womens' workforce participation.

That history --

A generation ago.

2

a generation?
MS. PILLARD:

Well, when Congress was acting in

3

1993, it was only 20 years since Title VII had been

4

extended to the States, and less than that since this

5

Court had adopted heightened scrutiny of sex-based

6

classifications based on the recognition that public

7

agencies have a -- have a tendency to rely on overbroad

8

sex-based generalizations, overbroad sex-based

9

classifications, so it was -- it was only since the 1970's

10

that we started to recognize that discrimination that we

11

had previously seen as benign, as often intended to help

12

women, was really hindering their advancement, and to --

13

and to seek to try to dismantle that system.

14

QUESTION:

And the changes in the unemployment

15

and Workers' Compensation laws, those persisted.

16

the Wengler decision in 1980?

MS. PILLARD:

That's right.

Wasn't

We have

And States all have that kind of one-

22

not considered really an equal worker.

MS. PILLARD:

Really her wages were

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIET D. DINH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. DINH:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Family and Medical Leave Act is just one

10
11

part of a broader statutory scheme to eliminate sex-based

12

employment discrimination in the hiring, retention,

13

promotion, and granting of leave benefits for both men and

14

women, and that's the key point to emphasize here.

15

Congress was acting not simply to remedy discrimination in

16

leave-granting policies, but more fundamentally Congress

17

sought to remedy and prevent sex-based employment

18

discrimination based on impermissible presumptions about

19

the role of women in the home and the role of men in the

20

office.

21

QUESTION:

I --

22

QUESTION:

In our cases, is there any difference

23

between Congress' prohibiting something under its section

24

5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that

25

power?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. DINH:

I have not seen a distinction in the

2

cases, in the section 5 cases of this Court.

3

and far between, as you can --

They are few

4

QUESTION:

Uh-huh, right.

5

MR. DINH:

-- as you can appreciate, but the

6

distinction is not readily made.

One can characterize the

7

entitlement here as simply a prohibition on discrimination

8

for men and women who take leave.

It is simply an --

9

QUESTION:

No, it isn't, it's 12 weeks.

10

QUESTION:

-- entitlement to come back to a job.

11

QUESTION:

Well, it's a 12-week period.

12

QUESTION:

It says you get 12 weeks, and if --

13

if we approve this, we are establishing the proposition

14

that in order to eliminate, to enforce any of the

15

provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in particular

16

equal protection, the Government may establish whatever

17

substantive requirements might further equal protection,

18

and I just don't know where the Government plucks 12 weeks

19

from and says that it -- we have to stop discrimination,

20

and therefore everybody's entitled to 12 weeks of leave,

21

and it's an extraordinary leap.

22

MR. DINH:

Your Honor, I disagree that there is

23

no limiting principle here, and the limiting principle is

24

precisely provided by this Court's jurisprudence in

25

congruence and proportionality.

That's precisely the

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limiting principle as to what is the constitutional

2

violation that Congress seeks to redress, and whether or

3

not the remedy is congruent and proportional.
The constitutional violation here that Congress

4
5

seeks to redress or to prevent is employment-based

discrimination based upon presumptions about leave-taking

habits of men and women.

Is that what was really going on when this 12-

10

week -- I mean, I -- I was around at the time, and I

11

remember the big -- the big discussion was whether there

12

ought to be a Federal law that requires all employers, not

13

States in particular, but all employers to give all

14

workers 12 weeks of family leave if they wanted it.

15

was what all the discussion was.

discussion at the time of sex discrimination, and you

17

present it to us as though this was the motivating factor

18

of the legislation.

MR. DINH:

20

That

I didn't hear any

I find that hard to believe.
Your Honor, I was not there at the

time, and I --

21

(Laughter.)

MR. DINH:

But I will take your word for it, but

23

more importantly, I think we should take Congress' word on

24

its face.

25

purpose of the, one of the purpose of the statute is,

Congress says at 29 U.S.C. 2601(b)(5) that the

40
Alderson Reporting Company

1

quote, to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity

2

for women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause,

3

and the further evidence --

4

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia is right, is he not,

5

that it -- the bill that he's talking about was the '87

6

bill, and that didn't say anything about the Equal

7

Protection Clause, and that's the startling difference

8

between the bill that actually passed in 1993.

9

MR. DINH:

That's precisely right, Justice

10

O'Connor -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg.

11

talking about S. 249, the 1987 bill.

12

the section (5), the promotion goal that entered into the

13

statute was in the next iteration, H.R. 925 in the House,

14

in 1987, and concurrent with the insertion of the

15

promotion of equal opportunity, Congress also included the

16

provision for family leave for care of parent illnesses,

17

as opposed to simple -- simply children illnesses.

18

there is some concurrency with respect to Congress'

19

reliance on, for the first time, section (5) authority and

20

the grant of family leave, and that's consistent with the

21

legislative record that was before Congress.

22

Justice Scalia was
The first time that

And so

Congress was facing a situation where it was

23

finding more two-worker families entering in the workforce

24

and increased demand for family care in the workforce, and

25

it said that, based upon the evidence, as Justice Souter

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had summarized, that when push came to shove, women would

2

be expected to take leave to take care of the family, and

3

Congress was finding that push was, indeed, coming to

4

shove, and was adopting a remedy that was directly

5

proportional and congruent to the period of constitutional

6

violation.

this Court has said is impermissible.

17

has fine -- is so finely tuned, and this Court's lack

18

of -QUESTION:

19
20

Of course, that jurisprudence came

after the statute was enacted anyway.
MR. DINH:

21

And I do not think that this Court's

22

evaluation of congressional enactments under section (5),

23

the unique remedial powers of Congress under section (5),

24

would turn on whether it's 10 weeks or 12 weeks or 13

25

weeks.

Of course, if it is more an increase, then it

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

would be less proportional, if it is less, then it would

be more proportional.

length.

imagine that it would turn on the length.

You have to get to the 1993 version

13

of the statute to introduce the equal protection notion,

This is the normal give-and-take of the

QUESTION:

And this was the statute that was

11

repeatedly vetoed, as I remember it, the bill, by

12

President Bush, and the basis for the veto had nothing to

13

do with discrimination, that it really was based on the

14

length of the provision.

15

MR. DINH:

No, Your Honor, you are right, the --

16

I have reviewed the veto statements.

They concern the

17

imposition that these types of policies would have on

18

small businesses and the economy of the United States,

19

rather than on the discrimination provisions at issue.

20

But it's clear that Congress, in passing the statute, was

21

relying on the discrimination, discriminatory effects that

22

these types of leave policies would have on women.

23

think the crux of this case, if I may, turns exactly,

24

Justice O'Connor, on your comparison with the evidence

25

that was before Congress when it enacted Title VII, when

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And I

1

it extended that, when it included that into the gender.

2

As you may recall, this Court in, I believe in

3

Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, recounted the legislative

4

history of how gender entered into Title VII, and it was

5

entered there as the legislative equivalent of the poison

6

pill in order to attempt to kill Title VII, and so not

7

much evidence was put into the record regarding gender

8

discrimination, and yet, as you noted in 1976, in

9

Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, this Court assumed that that was

10

adequate in order to invoke section (5) authority, or

11

justify section (5) authority.
QUESTION:

12

Do -- do you want us to say that

13

before the Family Medical Leave Act was enacted there was

14

a discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful

15

discrimination by the States in violation of the Equal

16

Protection Clause with reference to the granting of leave?
MR. DINH:

17

There was evidence, with respect to

18

the granting of leave, of such discrimination in the

19

record before Congress, yes, Your Honor, but in addition

20

to that, there was a discernible pattern of employment

21

discrimination that this Court had taken judicial notice

22

of and Congress had before it and, in particular, Congress

23

has evidence of employment discrimination based on leave-

24

taking presumptions that this Court has found to be

25

illegal.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

I guess you're thinking under this

2

Court's cases, which we accept as a given, Congress would

3

have more leeway to create a remedy for the general

4

discrimination than it might have if the discrimination,

5

that if the leave discrimination were at issue?

6

MR. DINH:

It goes into both the --

7

QUESTION:

You think there's enough for both,

8

but the remedial power is greater, is that right?
MR. DINH:

9

There's no question that under the --

10

under Kimel the Court has said that difficult, intractable

11

problems often require more powerful remedies, and that

12

would certainly be the, how the Court would evaluate -QUESTION:

13

It's hard for me to see there's a

14

discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful

15

discrimination when in the legislative history of this act

16

the States were cited as being in the forefront of

17

enlightened policies.

18

you're up here arguing just the opposite.
MR. DINH:

19

That's what the record shows, and

Your Honor, some States were in the

20

vanguard, some States were laggards in the granting of

21

leave policies.

22

QUESTION:

But the latter was not mentioned.

23

MR. DINH:

Yes, there -- yes, it was, Your

24

Honor.

I would refer Your Honor to the United States

25

brief at pages 36 to 40, and also the brief for the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

petitioner at pages 29 through 30, which recounts some of

2

this -- some of this evidence.
The key here -- but nevertheless, the statement

3
4

in the record that you noted was about States' leave

5

policies, whether or not they had leave policies at all.

6

We know 30 States had -- had leave policy.

7

of the United States rests upon not whether States had

8

leave policy, but the character of such leave policies.
QUESTION:

9

The position

Mr. Dinh, would it violate this

10

statute for a State to provide the 12-week family leave to

11

men and women both, but also to continue a policy of 6-

12

week maternity leave?

Would that violate the statute?

13

MR. DINH:

In addition to a 12-week, Your Honor?

14

QUESTION:

In addition to the 12 weeks.

15

MR. DINH:

weeks not as maternity leave, but as pregnancy disability

17

leave --

Call it pregnancy disability leave.

19

MR. DINH:

Well, this is actually a matter of

20

quite -- quite good -- quite --

21

QUESTION:

What's in a name?

22

MR. DINH:

No, no, it is a matter of substance,

23

not form alone, because pregnancy disability, medically

24

and in insurance terms --

25

QUESTION:

No necessity to prove disability,

mean --

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. DINH:

If that is the case, then that

14

would -- that may very well violate Title VII.

15

not violate this particular statute.

16
17
18

I

It would

QUESTION:

Would it violate the Equal Protection

MR. DINH:

Yes, it may very well violate the

Clause?

19

Equal Protection Clause if it is above and beyond the

20

pregnancy disability leave that this Court has recognized

21

can be accommodated, unconstitutionally though --

22

QUESTION:

That would solve the problem, unless

23

your answer is categorically yes, it would violate it,

24

because then the discrepancy, the 30 percent versus 80

25

percent that we're talking about would continue.

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DINH:

Well, the -- the key here, Justice

2

Scalia, is that after the period that is recognized as

3

pregnancy disability, and therefore constitutional under

4

Geduldig, beyond that, parental leave, infant care leave

5

is simply parental leave, and there's no difference

6

whether the mother or the father takes care of the child.
Indeed, the law would not countenance such a

7
8

difference, because that would be relying on the very

9

presumptions that the law condemns.

And so the key here

10

is that if there is an additional grant of leave to either

11

sex beyond the period of pregnancy disability, that would

12

constitute a violation of Title VII.

13

constitute a violation of the FMLA.

It would not

The reason for that is very simple.

14

The FMLA

15

was enacted as part of the overall antidiscrimination

16

scheme.

17

It paints a little bit more broad -- more broadly than

18

Title VII in the sense that it grants affirmative leave

19

rights, but in one further, in one important respect it

20

paints very much more narrowly, as your -- as your

21

question to my colleague, Mr. Taggart, had indicated,

22

Justice Kennedy.

23

tailored to the particular problem that Congress was

24

facing, which is the problem of employment discrimination

25

based on leave-taking propensities.

It supplements and does not supplant Title VII.

That is because it is very narrowly

And so in that sense

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it is perfectly congruent to the constitutional problem

2

that Congress was addressing.

3

Congress could not very well have addressed the

4

problem of gender-based differentials and the presumptions

5

in law and in practice that arise from those differentials

6

by granting additional leave rights only to women, or

7

granting leave rights only to men that would perpetuate

8

the discrimination and the presumptions, rather than

9

eliminate it root and branch.

10

The key to the money damages is the same key as

11

it is in our general antidiscrimination statutes.

12

should not be a surprising -- Title VII has the same type

13

of damage remedies, and the reason for that is that

14

discrimination, whether it be for race or for gender, is

15

pervasive and pernicious and historically recognized by

16

this Court, and so Congress has made a judgment that it

17

needs as many hands on deck as possible in order to

18

enforce the effort to eradicate discrimination, and money

19

damages is part of the normal remedy in order to ensure

20

that plaintiffs are made whole and State actors are

21

deterred from acting unconstitutionally or, in this case,

22

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. TAGGART:

First, it's important to

13

distinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirth

14

and when a child is adopted is not the question that was

15

presented to this Court today.

16

The question presented to this Court is family

17

leave, and there's certainly no record of family leave

18

differentials, as has been argued with respect to

19

parenting leave, and second, it is not possible under any

20

jurisprudence of this Court to simply presume that State

21

managers discriminate based upon some stereotype.

22

VII doesn't do that, the Equal Protection Clause, this

23

Court's section (1) jurisprudence that interprets the

24

Equal Protection Clause doesn't do that, the heightened

25

scrutiny test does not do that, it does not allow someone

Title

1

to simply presume that State managers are using some --

2

some outdated stereotype in making their decisions.

3

The third point I want to make is, it's our

4

position that one who reads the text and the history of

5

the Family and Medical Leave Act would hardly recognize

6

the statute that has been described here today.

7

simply every-day economic legislation, and upholding the

8

FMLA would simply tear section (5) from any remedial

9

moorings by allowing a general legislative power of

This was

10

Congress to grant economic benefits so long as there is

11

some incidental benefit to some suspect class.

12

QUESTION:

You mean holding, upholding money

13

damages under the FMLA, because I take it you concede, or

14

don't you, that Nevada is bound to follow this law?

15

MR. TAGGART:

Since -- I do concede that, and

16

since 1993 Nevada has had a -- a State policy of giving

17

our workers Federal family medical leave.

18

our own State medical leave laws, so States have joined,

19

and have actually led the Federal Government in providing

20

family leave for their employees, and to simply say, and

21

ignore that -- that pattern and say instead that States

22

are engaged in a pattern of discrimination, or were

23

engaged in 1993 in a pattern of discrimination, in our

24

view does not stand up to any of this Court's section (1)

25

jurisprudence.
