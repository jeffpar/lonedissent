CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 02-182, Georgia versus John Ashcroft.

Mr. Walbert.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WALBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

For some 6 decades now, the policy of the United

11

States has been to embrace integration, reject segregation

12

and separation of people.

13

of the United States of America stands pretty much as the

14

beacon in the world to the notion that balkanization is

15

not the way to go.

16

public life, integration, working together, not separating

17

people on the basis of race is our goal.

We stand -- really, the Nation

Particularly in public affairs and in

This Court started that trend, that great trend,

18
19

in the early -- in the 1940s with the original decisions

20

of Smith versus Allright, putting aside segregation, the

21

past history of that in this country, the ICC, Interstate

22

Commerce Commission desegregation decisions, Brown versus

23

Board of Education, voting rights cases, jury cases, and

24

so on.

25

Court was the leader on that at all times, has always

And the policy of the United States, as this

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

been -- has been for integration, for treating people the

2

same independent of their color.

3

Congress followed behind this Court, started

4

adopting some of the early Civil Rights Act in the early

5

1950s, the more moderate ones, if you will, under -- under

6

President Eisenhower's administration, and of course, the

7

great Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted.

8

Rights was enacted; and the 1968 Open Housing Act.

1965, Voting

9

Throughout that entire time, the policy of

10

integration has been the policy that this Nation has

11

embraced and espoused and advocated.

12

to Your Honors respectfully that the State of Georgia --

13

the position the State of Georgia puts before this Court

14

in this case today stands four square in the center of

15

that tradition.

16

And I would submit

Georgia comes here to this Court today

17

advocating that politics should be open and integrated.

18

Politics should not have allocations unnecessarily, in

19

particular, of seats based on race.

20

this Court that what we say is totally consistent with

21

everything this Court has said that touches upon this

22

matter and in this particular regard.

23

QUESTION:

I would submit to

Could we bring it down to what we

24

have to decide here, which is whether there was

25

retrogression or not?

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALBERT:

2

going -- excuse me.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I was

And on that, do we look at the whole

4

State and what would happen overall, or do we just focus

5

on individual legislative senatorial districts?

6

MR. WALBERT:

Well, I think you look at both,

7

and when you look at the whole plan of redistricting, then

8

you go down to look at the district.

9

without the other.

You can't do one

One looks at, first of all, the whole

10

plan and sees if opportunities are the same in terms of

11

majority and minority seats, for example, or opportunities

12

where minorities have a real opportunity get election, and

13

sees whether that, under the whole plan, is the same and

14

whether that's been maintained.

15

And to do that, though, one has to look --

16

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what ended up deciding

17

this case apparently was the fact that in three of the

18

districts that were drawn for the Senate, the number of

19

black voters decreased under the new plan from what it had

20

been, and they had been very safe districts --

21

MR. WALBERT:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- assured of electing black

23

officials before, and it was reduced to around 50 percent.

24

Is that right?

25

MR. WALBERT:

That's correct.

The -- the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

likelihood of winning -- the -- the black voter age

2

population was reduced to about 50 percent --

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MR. WALBERT:

-- which according to the

5

evidence, would give about a 75 percent chance of a

6

minority candidate of choice winning in that particular

7

district.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

And was that the finding of the court

below?
MR. WALBERT:

The finding was that safe seats --

11

the rule of law was that safe seats must be maintained.

12

To get a safe seat here, one had to raise these 4 to

13

5 percent.

14

QUESTION:

Is --

15

QUESTION:

So that's the --

16

QUESTION:

Is -- is that one of the ways, at

17

least, that you think we ought to view this case?

18

understand it, no one on the other side is claiming that

19

the percentage of safety has got to be maintained in order

20

to avoid retrogression.

21

As I

But one difference between you and them, at

22

least as I am reading what you're saying, is you, I think,

23

are saying they maintain the same opportunity to elect.

24

Minorities maintain the same opportunity to elect if they

25

use their best efforts and their good politicians in doing

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

it.

Whereas, the other side seems to be saying, there's

2

got to be more of a margin of safety for maintaining -- or

3

avoiding retrogression than merely best efforts.

4

should be some margin of safety, even if it's not as great

5

as it used to be under the old districts.

6

way of looking at the disagreement?
MR. WALBERT:

7

There

Is that a fair

I -- I think it understates it a

8

little bit, in all due respect, Justice Souter, because I

9

think the district court came squarely down.

If you look

10

at the majority opinions -- and both Judge Sullivan and

11

Judge Edwards wrote ones that were concurred in about each

12

other -- and Judge Oberdorfer's decision, the line is safe

13

seats.

14

only way that those can be looked at in this case is that

15

all of the evidence is -- when you get to that level, no

16

one has ever -- on an open seat in Georgia, no one's ever

17

lost a 54 percent BVAP seat.

18

One must maintain safe seats.

QUESTION:

And I think the

Mr. Walbert, I didn't get that

19

impression from Judge Edwards' opinion or Judge

20

Sullivan's.

They both say we are dealing with a narrow

21

section 5.

It has a concept, retrogression, backsliding.

22

And I assume that they would say if you start out, you

23

start with the status quo.

24

you start out with, say, 30 percent and you end up with

25

30 percent, it's okay.

Everyone agrees with that.

You don't have to have a safe

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

If

1

district because the starting point may not be safe.
MR. WALBERT:

2

I -- I agree entirely with that,

3

Your Honor.

I didn't mean to suggest that they are

4

requiring more than that.

5

districts that evolved demographically from the 1990

6

Census, when two more districts under the old districting

7

plan became majority minority, became high BVAP -- let's

8

take Senate District 26, for example.
QUESTION:

9

The fact is that these

Well, is it -- are you saying that

10

when you get up over a certain number of black voters,

11

say, 50 percent, then retrogression or backsliding is

12

really out of the picture because it's good enough?
MR. WALBERT:

13

Well, I would say this.

Where you

14

have a real equal opportunity at winning the seat, that is

15

enough.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's the -- that's the

17

conclusion, and we're -- we're looking for some kind of

18

indication at this point of whether that is true.

19

only indication that at least I have and I think that

20

Justice Ginsburg is -- is looking at right now are -- are

21

the percentage figures, the BVAP percentage figures.

22

MR. WALBERT:

And the

Well, I think this, Your Honor.

I

23

mean, the -- the court accepted Dr. Epstein's probability

24

curve all over -- any number of times.

25

page 36 the first time.

I think it was on

Dr. Epstein's evidence is -- his

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

study is reliable and relevant is what the court says in

2

that regard.

3

the only evidence in this case, plus the legislators who

4

testified, and -- and Congressman Lewis who testified

5

about the likelihood of winning at a 50 percent BVAP

6

level.

7

And I guess the critical thing is that was

QUESTION:

Let -- let me ask you this because

8

some of what you say might be explained as just a

9

difference of -- of -- a conclusion of facts, which we

10

have to accept.

11

majority opinions adopted below that were wrong?

12

wrong to talk about robust campaigning?

13

consider polarized voting?

14

controlling opinions make reference to any impermissible

15

legal standards?

16

Were there legal premises that the

MR. WALBERT:

Was it

Was it wrong to

Were there -- did the

Well, I think the bottom line

17

standard of safe seat is the problem that we have.

18

not sure that -- they didn't speak of robust campaigning,

19

with all due respect, Justice Kennedy.

20

districts, meaning -- they equated that with safe.

21

the -- the point -- that is the legal issue.

22

fundamental legal flaw in the opinion of the majority

23

below that we take issue with, the fact that one must

24

maintain safe seats and --

25

QUESTION:

I'm

It was robust
And

That is the

What's -- what's the legal issue?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALBERT:

2

QUESTION:

That --

That is, I -- I thought there's a

3

statute, and the statute here says that you cannot have a

4

new plan which will have the effect of abridging the right

5

to vote on account of race.

6

MR. WALBERT:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And Judge Edwards says that that

8

statute has been interpreted to mean you cannot backslide,

9

and he adds that if you go from a safe seat to a seat

10

where there's only a fair opportunity, that is clearly

11

backsliding unless it's made up for in other districts.

12

Let's call it frontsliding.

13

of frontsliding, and here there are two experts who

14

disagree as to the backsliding.

15

there isn't, and the other is Engstrom --

16

MR. WALBERT:

17

QUESTION:

And here there is no evidence

One is Epstein who thinks

Well --

-- who thinks there is.

And two

18

judges below agreed with Engstrom and one judge below

19

agreed with Epstein.

20

MR. WALBERT:

21

QUESTION:

I --

Now, are we supposed to do -- to go

22

back and redo the work of those three judges and say,

23

well, we happen to think Epstein was better or the other

24

one thinks Engstrom was better?

25

case is about?

Is that this -- what this

And if it isn't about this, I don't know

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

what it's about.
MR. WALBERT:

2

Well, first, that's not what

3

happened in the record.

4

testimony.

5

the case about the likelihood of winning.

6

Engstrom came in and said there is racially polarized

7

voting, and he criticized that and the Department

8

criticized it, and it was relied upon.

9

American candidates were winning in election after

10

election after election in which he said there is a

11

problematic racially polarized voting.

There was no testimony but from our side of

QUESTION:

12

Professor Engstrom gave no

Professor

But the African

I -- I'm overstating what I say for

13

purposes of clarity, because you're giving a view of

14

Engstrom, and I'm sure the other side will give a somewhat

15

different view, but nonetheless, I want to know what it is

16

I'm supposed to do as a judge in this Court.
After reading it, I thought what you're asking

17
18

me to do is to go back, look at what Judge Edwards and the

19

other majority judge cite as convincing, factual, detailed

20

statistical evidence, look at the evidence of the

21

political figures who are very distinguished whom Judge

22

Oberdorfer cites the other way, and remake that evaluation

23

that three judges of -- of a three-judge district court

24

did.

25

right what you think we should do in this case?

Now, my question is, is that right?

Have it got it

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALBERT:

2

QUESTION:

3

I'm supposed to do?

4

No, you do not.

All right.

MR. WALBERT:

Good.

Then what is it

The rule of law that was

5

established here by the majority of having to maintain --

6

having to maintain a safe seat.

7

they're not saying you have to create one if there wasn't

8

one, but the question is, do you have to maintain a seat

9

that's safe?

10

QUESTION:

All right.

There's no question

Why -- if that's the

11

issue, assuming that the safe seat, going down to only a

12

probable seat, is nowhere made up for by countervailing

13

factors elsewhere in the State, assuming that, why isn't

14

going from a safe seat to a fair probability seat -- why

15

is that not backsliding, retrogression, other things being

16

equal, an abridgement, a -- the effect of abridging the

17

right to vote because of race?

18

MR. WALBERT:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Well --

Why isn't it?

It if that's the

issue, why isn't it?
MR. WALBERT:

There's two reasons.

And -- and

22

first of all, no one disagrees that lowering

23

the percentage and the likelihood down -- the -- we're

24

not -- no one in this case, including the district court,

25

says you can't lower the probabilities.

So what Your

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor is saying is a position more extreme than what the

2

majority says below.

3

QUESTION:

I'm reading -- I'll say it again

4

because I'm reading from Judge Edwards.

5

district --

6

MR. WALBERT:

7

QUESTION:

Going from a safe

Yes, sir.

-- into one where there is only a

8

fair opportunity, that -- that, he says, other things

9

being equal in the State, will constitute retrogression in

10

effect, not necessarily in purpose, but in effect.

11

now, why isn't that so?

12

MR. WALBERT:

And

And -- and my point is that he is

13

conceding that dropping down from a certain seat to a safe

14

seat is okay.

15

square to the notion of retrogression?

16

in this courtroom, including the majority below, that

17

there can be decreases in the likelihood of success.

18

only question in this Court -- in this case is where do

19

you draw the line?

20

Now, how does that -- how can that possibly
Everybody agrees

The

Safe or equal seats?

Safe is just out of the air.

Never before in

21

the history of this Court has anyone ever said safe is

22

the -- is the Plimsoll line or the water line beyond which

23

you cannot drop.

24
25

QUESTION:
safe and certain.

You're drawing a distinction between

MR. WALBERT:

QUESTION:

The

A drop that makes no difference.

That's -- that's how I understood their opinion.
MR. WALBERT:

I don't think that could be,

because -QUESTION:

A safe seat is a safe seat.

It means

a certain seat.
MR. WALBERT:

No, it doesn't in this case, Your

13

Honor, because when you get to the levels they're talking

14

about, there is still a possibility for sure, whether it's

15

20 percent or whatever, but that's a real possibility.

16

QUESTION:

But I didn't think we're dealing with

17

safe versus certain in this case.

18

dealing in this case is two judges decided that dropping

19

from safe to whatever you want to characterize this

20

level -- Edwards characterizes it as fair probability, but

21

characterize it as you wish -- dropping from safe to this

22

level, however you want to characterize this, is a

retrogression.

So what is it that you, aside from re-evaluating

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the evidence, believe that we should say?

2
3

MR. WALBERT:

They used different legal

standards, with all due respect, Justice Breyer.

4

QUESTION:

And what is that difference?

5

MR. WALBERT:

Safe versus equal.

That is the

6

difference in the legal standards between the majority

7

and -- and the decision below.

8

QUESTION:

9

Or why is Edwards' standard in your

opinion wrong?
MR. WALBERT:

10

Because I think it's inconsistent

11

with what this Court has said on section 5 before.

And if

12

I might read several of the -- just a sentence.

13

going to start with Justice Marshall, who was the most

14

aggressive interpreter and advocate of what section 5

15

would mean.

16

States versus Mississippi in 1980, he three times

17

addressed what section 5 requires in a retrogression

18

context.

And I'm

And in his dissent, in the case of United

And he said in the first thing, it requires a

19
20

reasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their

21

choice.

22

under Justice Marshall's interpretation of section 5.

23

That's on page 1055 of that decision.

24
25

That is what a district had to be maintained like

Again, on the next -- on page 1057, Justice
Marshall says, the numbers must be sufficient to provide,

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

quote, a fair opportunity to elect candidates, unquote.
QUESTION:

2
3

That sounds very much like section 2

language.
MR. WALBERT:

4

And -- and that's in section 5

5

under Justice Marshall is all I'm saying, Your Honor,

6

because this issue that is in this case today has never

7

been squarely put before this Court.

8

language of the Court interpreting, where does section 5

9

kick in when there is still fair, equal districts.
QUESTION:

10

But all the prior

I thought that the Bossier, the two

11

cases, clarified the difference between section 2 and

12

section 5, and what you just read from Justice Marshall

13

sounds to me like the section 2 standard.

14

MR. WALBERT:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well --

Section 5 standard is you start with

what you have, you look to see if there's backsliding.
MR. WALBERT:

17

I think the problem, though,

18

Judge -- and -- and certainly you start with backsliding

19

and retrogression, but the question is, where does inquiry

20

stop?

21

down to 80 percent, the chances clearly change on

22

electoral success, without a doubt.

23

Goes from 100 to 60, 100 to 55.

24

palpable change.

25

court, because at least we stopped at safe.

Truly, you could say at a 100 percent district goes

That is inevitable.

That is a real and

That is okay, according to the district

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

That's our problem.

We don't think safe is

2

where you arbitrarily draw the line to stop.

No decision

3

of this Court ever has suggested that before.

So is --

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, you start with, say, 55.

Where

does backsliding start in your view of section 5?
MR. WALBERT:

6

In our view of section 5, so long

7

as -- if you have a district that is -- that it has at

8

least an equal opportunity, it must be maintained in that

9

fashion.

If you have a -- a district where minorities

10

have an equal opportunity or better, to prevail and to

11

control.

12

QUESTION:

Well, then how do you fit

13

backsliding, retrogression --

14

MR. WALBERT:

15

QUESTION:

16

what?

17

fair opportunity?

18

44?

If you go -- excuse me.

If -- if you go, say, from 55 to

That's okay because you -- you would have a

MR. WALBERT:

If the evidence in a particular

19

case would show that, that -- you know, we never went

20

below 50 on anything, so that's not here in this case.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Although it would seem an unusual

definition of backslide.
MR. WALBERT:

Well, I think the problem is this,

24

though, Your Honor.

Where -- what would be the policy

25

reason where a section of the Voting Rights Act,

17
Alderson Reporting Company

section 5, could be construed to mandate a State to

MR. WALBERT:

Yes, sir.

by some of our opinions to mean that once a certain level

is reached, you're abridging or denying the right to vote

if it goes below that level of -- of safety.

Is that it?

21

MR. WALBERT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

And you --

23

QUESTION:

And the reason for that is because, I

24

gather, historically there were quite a few instances

25

where, indeed, in the South, you could elect -- a black

representative was elected by a black community in, let's

say, one district.

3

is that the district boundaries are changed so that there

4

happened to be a lot fewer black representatives elected

5

out of districts that were predominantly black.

6

that's why Congress passed this statute.

And then, lo and behold, what happens

MR. WALBERT:

Sure, it does, as been interpreted

was passed was to fit in with the literacy test.

take into account the likelihood of winning primaries as

13

In any of the analysis, do the -- the judges

MR. WALBERT:

It's -- it's implicit in what we

14

did because we looked at the whole election scheme.

15

Everything that Dr. Epstein did was the whole election.

16

Dr. Engstrom made no distinction between nonpartisan

elections, generals, and primaries.

together and treated them in one ball of wax.

19

certainly did, and our evidence always looked at

I know that's what you're arguing,

section 5 prevents retrogression.

boils down to what amounts to retrogression.
MR. WALBERT:

So I think this case

And I think, Your Honor, with all

16

due respect here, I believe that the problem with

17

interpreting it to be an absolutist at the safe seat

level, you've got to -- in our opinion -- and we raised

19

the issue, of course -- is a grave constitutional

20

question.

City of Boerne versus Florida is the most detailed

discussion recently about section 5 enforcement power

everybody on the Court agreed with the formulation there.

What is the legitimate ends?

The reason that section 5 is in there is that

efforts simply to achieve your Plimsoll line, the -- the

equal opportunity, historically failed over and over and

over and over again because every time a decree came down

21

saying equal opportunity is required, there would be

another voting change that, in fact, would inject a -- a

every time, resulted in something less than equality.

And the new fact pattern, just about

Section 5 is there, in effect, to say you

Alderson Reporting Company

1

can't -- you can't make a move without advance approval,

3

Beer, the only way to -- or the -- the best way at least,

4

to keep from moving that line in a way which is going to

5

result in less than an equal opportunity is to insist that

6

at least the status quo, as best you can determine it, is,

7

in fact, not going to be modified by the change.

8

the status quo is some measure of safety, then the theory

9

of section 5 is preserve the measure of safety because if

historical argument.

It's essentially an

And what do you say to that?

MR. WALBERT:

Several things.

First of all, the

16

history Your Honor cites, which is correct in some

17

regards, has nothing to do with redistricting history as a

18

matter of fact in Georgia at least.

19

QUESTION:

That's what we -- that's what you get

20

for general laws.

21

that's the theory behind it.

22

We have eight --

We -- we've got a general law, and

MR. WALBERT:

Well, I think insofar as you're

23

trying to apply that in interpreting section 5 in this

24

context, with all due respect, Justice Souter, I don't

25

think that that is a realistic way of interpreting it here

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

because of that history.
If the mere fact that there was segregation and

3

so on before 1965, a horrible history before 1965, that

4

that was enough to justify in the year 2003 where African

5

Americans are demonstrably having success that no one

6

would have dreamed of in 1965 in the State of Georgia --

7

in a 26 percent black State, one-quarter of the statewide

8

elected officials are African American today in the State

9

of Georgia.

And to say that it is necessary is so

10

divorced from the factual reality that it wouldn't be a

11

fair factual predicate to apply that constitutionally to

12

the State of Georgia at this time in history.

13

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be -- why wouldn't it

14

be fair for us to say, number one, we're going to maintain

15

the Beer theory?

16

taken by Judge Edwards that if there was a margin of

17

safety before, there's got to be some margin of safety now

18

in order to comply with Beer and ultimately with

19

section 5, and we're going to leave the law alone to that

20

extent because the statute is up for renewal in a few

21

years, and that will be an appropriate time for Congress

22

to decide whether it wants to modify the standard or,

23

indeed, to continue to have any section 5 standard at all.

24

That's a timing argument.

25

And we're going to accept the position

MR. WALBERT:

What's your response to that?

I would say that's punting the

25
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WALBERT:

I don't know about that, Judge.

4

We don't have a problem with section 5.

It's the way it

5

would be applied if the district court were affirmed in

6

this case.
And the difficulty is that just the whole notion

7
8

of making section 5 compel more than the substance of

9

section 2 in a redistricting context, there's a grave

10

illogic about that given the narrow purpose of section 5

emergencies.

Don't -- don't let anything bad happen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

11

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In a section 5 preclearance action, the

14
15

appropriate comparison is between a covered jurisdiction's

16

proposed voting change and the jurisdiction's existing

17

practice.

18

In the present case, the district court found

19

that Georgia's proposed Senate districting plan was likely

20

to cause a significant diminution of black voters' ability

21

to elect their candidates of choice.

22

QUESTION:

In -- in preclearing, does the

23

Government look at the effect as a whole?

What if, under

24

the plan, it's true that the districts reduced the black

25

voter population somewhat from the prior districting, but

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

in so doing, they picked up enough black voters in another

district that gave them an additional elected official of

the minority race --

that the analysis should focus on the plan as a whole, and

9

our guidance is --

10

QUESTION:

You do look at it as a whole.

11

MR. STEWART:

12

QUESTION:

13

resulted in a gain as a whole?

And you didn't think that this plan

MR. STEWART:

14

We do look at the plan as a whole.

No, because our -- our feeling was

15

that there were three Senate districts that we focused on

16

specifically because we felt, for a variety of reasons,

17

that the diminution in black population was likely to have

18

a significant impact on black voters' ability to elect

19

candidates of choice in those three districts.

20

we also looked to where those black voters were going.

21

Were they being redistributed to other districts in which

22

they would increase the ability to elect candidates of

23

choice?

24
25

And we --

The -- the focus of the inquiry has always been
on the ability to elect candidates of choice.

instance, if -QUESTION:

2

Well, with certainty or -- or

3

ability?

I'm -- I'm really concerned about how far we are

4

getting from the text of the statute.

5

nothing about retrogression.

6

about redistricting.

7

one of the States who were covered by section 5 seeks to

8

administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to

9

voting, or standard practice or procedure with respect to

The statute says

Indeed, it says nothing

It -- it's -- it -- it says that if

10

voting, which I would have thought meant, you know,

11

whether you vote on a -- on a working day or on a

12

non-working day, whether the polls are open for a certain

13

amount of time or not.

14

cover districting.

Anyway, we've expanded that to

15

Then it goes on and it says, any change cannot

16

have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying

17

or abridging the right to vote on account of race or

18

color.

19

abridging the right -- the right to vote if you backslide.

20

If -- if a -- even though all of the black or minority

21

citizens can vote just the way they did before, if

22

the percentage of -- of minority voters in a -- in a

23

certain district goes down, we have denied or abridged

24

their right to vote.

25

And we have said that that means you're denying or

I -- I find that -- maybe that is a plausible

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

interpretation of the statute when you are going from a

2

good chance to elect a minority candidate to no chance of

3

electing a minority candidate.

4

that far, but to say that you're abridging or denying the

5

right to vote when you go from a certainty or safe seat

6

for electing a minority candidate to a mere probability

7

of -- of electing a minority candidate -- to say that that

8

constitutes a denying or abridging of the right to vote

9

seems to me to -- you know, in violation of the -- of the

10

legal principle that fun's fun but you can't die laughing.

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

Maybe you can stretch it

I mean, that is such a -- such a

13

stretch of the statutory language that the -- that the

14

Government is asking us to accept that I -- I find it

15

implausible.

16
17

MR. STEWART:

Several points.

The -- the Court-

in the second Bossier Parish case discussed the

18

retrogression standard and grounded it in the word abridge

19

and explained that the -- the word abridge necessarily

20

implies a comparison to some baseline.

21

section 2 context, the baseline is a hypothetical

22

reasonable world.

23

specifically at voting changes, the appropriate baseline

24

is the jurisdiction's existing practice.

that the reduction that counts is the reduction below the

10

point where the minority has a probability of winning the

11

election?

12

the minority has a certainty of -- of winning the

13

election?

14

Why does it have to be below the point where

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- I think one -- one

15

thing the Court should focus on is that when we're talking

16

about the Senate districts at issue here, we are talking

17

about districts that are among the strongest for blacks in

18

the State of Georgia; that is, under the benchmark plan,

19

13 out of 56 districts with -- Senate districts within the

20

State had majority black voting age populations.

21

in a State that's approximately 27 percent black in terms

22

of voting age population.

23

which blacks are strongest have been reduced to a point

24

where blacks have an equal opportunity to elect candidates

25

is not equivalent to saying that in the State as a whole

a 1999 runoff election, the black candidate of choice had

5

won the -- the primary by only 70 votes, and the reason

was that the black candidate received approximately

7

78 percent of the black vote but only 9 percent of the

8

white vote, and then --

9

QUESTION:

I do know

Does the State have any latitude

insofar as your interpretation of the statute is concerned

11

and insofar as your Department policy is concerned to

experiment to see if it can't expand the black franchise

in other districts?

position is -- is that the State is simply frozen in these

supermajority districts and it can't attempt to increase

Doesn't it have -- doesn't the State

have some latitude to try that?
MR. STEWART:

We certainly think that they do,

21

and -- and nothing that we've said in this case and

22

nothing that the district court said is to the contrary.

23

That is, if the State had sought to prove that the

24

likelihood of electing black voters' candidates of choice

25

in these three districts would be somewhat reduced, but

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that that was likely to be offset by corresponding

2

increases in the ability to elect -- to elect candidates

3

of choice in other districts -QUESTION:

4

Well, was that -- where did I get the

5

notion that there was very likely going to be, under their

6

plan, another minority official elected --

7

MR. STEWART:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. STEWART:

I --

-- in an additional district?
I don't -- there was -- there was

10

a pair of Senate Districts, not 2, 12, and 26, one of

11

which was reduced sharply in black population --

12

QUESTION:

I have the same -- I have the same

13

problem with Justice O'Connor.

14

was before us on -- on the assumption that there is a

15

likelihood that there will be another black representative

16

from another district --

I -- I thought the case

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

-- and that that was the testimony of

19

the State and the State said that this is the reason why

20

we're doing this.
MR. STEWART:

21

No.

That -- that's not the case

22

at all.

I think the -- the nature of the State's plan was

23

to reduce the high majorities of black voters in some

24

districts, and those voters would be redistributed to

25

other districts, but not districts in which there would be

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a high enough black population to create a plausible

2

likelihood of electing black candidates of choice.

3

QUESTION:

Why -- why is that the only change

4

that's relevant?

Why is it insignificant that you -- you

5

change a district that was previously lily-white into a

6

district that has, let's say, 30 percent black voters

7

whose wishes and whose desires have to be taken into

8

account by whoever is elected from that district, whether

9

he's white or black?

Why is that an insignificant benefit

10

to -- to the black voters in that district so they won't

11

get some -- some redneck discriminatory representative,

12

but rather somebody who will take into account their

13

needs, even if he's not a black man?

14

MR. STEWART:

As -- as an original matter, I

15

think an argument could be made that black voters

16

throughout the State of Georgia would be better off if

17

every district were 27 percent black on the theory that

18

even though they couldn't elect any candidates of choice,

19

they could influence all legislators.

20

argument could be made along those lines, the Court has

21

consistently, in its vote dilution cases, framed the

22

inquiry in terms of the ability to elect -- to elect

23

candidates of choice.

24
25

QUESTION:

But although an

We've never had a case before that --

that amounts to a reduction not below the level where they

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

can elect, but -- but just to the level where it's merely

2

probable as opposed to certain that -- that they can

3

elect.

4

taking that reality into account.

5

MR. STEWART:

6
7

I -- I don't know that we're foreclosed from

I -- I agree that the -- the

precise question hasn't come before this Court.
The two things I'd say are that, first, we are

8

talking about the strongest districts for blacks.

9

say that those districts have been reduced to an even

10

shot, a toss-up, is not to say that blacks have equal

11

electoral power statewide.

12

So to

The second point I'd make is this is not

13

different in principle from what goes on all the time in

14

other preclearance settings.

15

case that a covered jurisdiction will seek preclearance of

16

a voting change, and the change will consist of getting

17

rid of something that the jurisdiction had no obligation

18

to create in the first instance.

19

always focused on retrogression, on whether the State has

20

made black voters worse off than they were --

21

QUESTION:

That is, it is often the

But the inquiry has

Now, worse off, I thought -- and I'm

22

still at my same problem of what am I supposed to do in

23

this case.

24

vote is abridged because of race.

25

And that it isn't so much a question, though it's partly a

But I thought worse off means their right to
Abridged is the word.

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

question, of percentage of black voters in the district.

2

It is really a question of what a reduction in

3

that percentage means in terms of a -- a race, black

4

people, being able, across the State, to have a better or

5

worse chance of electing public officials that they want.

6

And that's a function of polarization because if there

7

isn't a lot of polarization, there is no such person as

8

the official they want.

9

polarization.

But there might be where there is

And it's also a function of how much of a

10

reduction you get in a particular district in terms of

11

what that means.

12

Now, if I'm thinking that way, A, is that the

13

right way to think about it?

14

alternative in this case but to go through the statistical

15

testimony about polarization?

16

any, which I'm not sure that there is or not -- I thought

17

the majority held there wasn't -- that somehow other

18

districts will be benefitted, and then sort of second

19

guess the district court.

20

Do I have it right?

21

I'm supposed to do?

22

B, if it is, do I have any

The testimony, if there is

What is it I'm supposed to do?

And if I have it right, is that what

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think you're looking at it

23

correctly.

And when the Justice Department approached

24

this case, there were other Senate districts in which the

25

absolute drop in black voting age population was much

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

greater than in these three districts.

2

found these districts problematic was partly the -- the

3

magnitude of the reduction, partly the fact that it had

4

occurred along a point in the spectrum where a 10 percent

5

reduction was especially likely to have a concrete impact.

6

That is, it stands to reason that reducing black

7

population from 60 percent to 50 percent will more likely

8

affect concrete results than reducing it from 80 percent

9

to 70 percent or from 20 percent to 10 percent.

10

MR. STEWART:

16
17

The reason we

It isn't just percents -And --

means in the context of the particular district.
MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

And we -- we

introduced -QUESTION:

And it's not just a little.

It has

to be a lot.

18

MR. STEWART:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEWART:

We introduced --

It has to mean a lot.
We introduced substantial

21

district-specific evidence of racial polarization in these

22

three specific Senate districts.

23

and anecdotal evidence to the effect that there was a high

24

degree of correlation between the race of the voter and

25

the candidate of choice and evidence that racial appeals

We -- both statistical

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

had been made in prior elections within those districts.

2

So the first step was to say, based on all that evidence,

3

there is a -- this change is likely to have a significant

4

impact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of

5

choice in these districts.

6

to that effect.
And the second thing that the district court

7
8
9

And the district court found

said -QUESTION:

I think the -- the district court

10

found that -- I thought there was a heavy concentration on

11

crossover in this record.

12

controversy about Engstrom?

13

would be minimal white crossover in these districts?

14

MR. STEWART:

Wasn't that the whole
Didn't he say that there

That's correct.

His -- his

15

analysis of the statistical evidence of prior elections

16

within the districts was that there would be minimal white

17

crossover voting.

18

polarization within these three districts specifically.

19

And so the district court found that the likelihood of

20

black candidates -- of black voters' ability being able to

21

elect candidates of choice in these three districts --

22

There was substantial racial

QUESTION:

Do the findings tell us whether

23

there's been any change in the last few years in the

24

amount of white crossover voting?

25

some anecdotal evidence to that effect.

It seems to me there's

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STEWART:

I -- I don't believe that there

2

were findings to that effect.

3

basically surveying the last --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

The -- the findings were

Were they based on evidence during

the last few years, or back in the '80s and '90s?
MR. STEWART:

During the last few years.

7

Basically the experience under the benchmark district.

8

But the second thing that the district court

9

said and -- and emphasized -- and I believe it's on

10

pages 133 and 134a of the appendix to the jurisdictional

11

statement.

12

the page, once again we note that it may well be the case

13

that any decrease in African American electoral power in

14

Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 will be offset by gains in

15

other districts, but plaintiff, namely the State, has

16

failed to present any such evidence.

17

The district court said at the very bottom of

So the district court acknowledged in principle

18

that even though black voters' ability to elect candidates

19

of choice in these three districts had been substantially

20

decreased, the State might, nevertheless, be able to prove

21

non-retrogression for the plan as a whole if it presented

22

evidence that there would be offsetting gains in other

23

districts.

24

of proof not for any -- not -- it didn't suggest that

25

there was a -- an analytical barrier to proceeding along

And the court faulted the State for a failure

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that basis.
So I think the district court regarded this as a

3

relatively easy case precisely because there were

4

meaningful losses in identified districts and no attempt

5

to prove offsetting gains in others.

6

retrogression standard has always focused on whether the

7

change renders minority voters worse off.

8
9

And again, the

And again, the -- the preclearance inquiry would
substantially -- be substantially complicated if the

10

analysis were otherwise.

11

instance, that relocation of polling places is one type of

12

change that has to be precleared before it can --

13

QUESTION:

That is the Court has held, for

Well, if they were not offsetting

14

gains, what was the gravamen of the testimony of the black

15

State officials who testified in favor of this plan?

16

MR. STEWART:

The -- the gravamen of the -- the

17

testimony was not that there would be offsetting gains in

18

black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice.

19

Really, the thrust of the plan was black voters would be

20

taken out of majority black districts and placed in

21

districts that were predominantly white.

22

percentages would be too low for the black electorate to

23

elect candidates of choice, but it might be high enough

24

that the black vote could swing the balance between a

25

white Republican and a white Democratic candidate.

The black

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

That

1

was really the thrust of the plan.
And because -- again, whatever might have been

2
3

said in the first instance, the Court's analysis has

4

focused on ability to elect candidates of choice.

5

Congress has amended section 2 to facilitate vote dilution

6

claims along those lines.

7

reenact section 5 against the backdrop of the Court's

8

decision.

9

made that it's more important for blacks to be the balance

Congress has continued to

So even though the argument could have been

10

of power in a lot of districts than to be able to elect

11

candidates of choice in a few, the Court has rejected that

12

proposition and Congress appears to have endorsed the

13

Court's holdings by continuing to reenact these provisions

14

without change.

If the Court has nothing further.

precisely to give black voters a -- a better choice, to --

10

And I think that's a

misinterpretation of this Court's position and a

misunderstanding of what the voting rights is meant to

I take it in your view if evidence had been put on the

stand that the black voter was better off, then you might

lose your side of the case.

MR. BRADEN:

Absolutely correct.

Mr. Walbert, you have 3 minutes left.

Thank you, Mr. Braden.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. WALBERT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

19

I would ask the Court to think of one question

20

here, and it is this question.

Is it remotely realistic

21

in the real world that 43 out of 45 African American

22

legislators who are the most sophisticated, knowledgeable

23

African Americans about politics and winning and political

24

power and electoral power would have voted for this if it

25

did all these bad things, if this wasn't the best way they

52
Alderson Reporting Company

1

could see of enhancing the power?

2

It's not conceivable.

3

can't possibly say that's possible.
QUESTION:

4

Is that conceivable?

That's -- that's fanciful.

One

And --

Well, it's conceivable if all they're

5

interested in -- is, is in race and you want us to presume

6

that.

7

They might also wanted to have kept their jobs.
MR. WALBERT:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

8

that there's -- that's realistic to think that the

9

delegation would vote themselves out of office, which is

10

what we're talking about.

11

so weak they're voting themselves out of office?

12

Are they making their districts
No.

Their testimony is unequivocal that this

13

enhances black voting strength because -- and the

14

Solicitor General was wrong when he says there's no

15

testimony that the other districts would be enhanced.

16

There is no testimony that any other districts would

17

become safe seats, but from a black point of view,

18

absolutely.

19

those other districts, the potential is enhancing, the

20

potential of getting someone the Democrats prefer who

21

happens to be white.

QUESTION:

So what -- what do I read and what

pages do I read?
MR. WALBERT:

3

It would be in the -- it's in

the -- the testimony of the legislators.

the proposed --

QUESTION:

MR. WALBERT:

It would be in

Okay.
It's -- I'm sorry.

8

testimony of the legislators.

9

quoted in our brief.

It's the

Some little bit of it is

It's in the proposed findings of

10

fact in great detail, but it's the testimony of the

11

legislators.
QUESTION:

12

The district court didn't consider

13

that relevant testimony because it was not testimony about

14

safe seats elsewhere.
MR. WALBERT:

15
16

I would think that's a fair

characterization, Your Honor.
As a practical matter, it would be a tragedy.

17
18

And we're well aware of the history.

19

apologizing that we are disowning the history of race in

20

Georgia.

21

what it is.

22

this case to utilize that history to penalize what African

23

Americans are trying to do -- tried to do in this

24

reapportionment under this evidence.

25

We know what it is.

We're not up here

The Attorney General knows

But it would be a tragedy on the facts of

Integration's working in Georgia.

We have the

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

most politically integrated political system probably in

2

the United States.
QUESTION:

3

That's what we're supposed to, go

4

into which political party is better for which particular

5

group of people?
MR. WALBERT:

6

No.

We look at the success of

7

what the record unequivocally and without contradiction

8

demonstrates in terms of African American success in the

9

State of Georgia, and it's a compelling record, Your

10

Honor.
It shows again that we have 4 congressmen out

11
12

of 13 who are African American, 52 percent district,

13

50 percent district, 41 percent district, and 38 percent

14

district.

15

District 13 just created -- this reapportionment got two

16

new districts.

17

elected.

18

a 28 percent multi-member house district.

19

Last one just elected 13 -- Congressional

13 was open, 38 percent, African American

African American elected in the last election in

QUESTION:

It's working.

May I ask before -- before you

20

conclude your argument, what is the status of the

21

litigation that's pending in the State court to resolve

22

the dispute between the Attorney General and the Governor?

23

MR. WALBERT:

Yes.

There's oral argument next

24

week on that, Your Honor, and we expect that to be decided

25

very quickly.

There is, of course, your favorable

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

decision from our position from the superior court.

2

That's on direct appeal to the supreme court, oral

3

argument next week and that will in all likelihood be

4

decided very, very promptly.

5

So --

And I think that -- what is the reason --

6

putting all these facts aside, which are compelling, if

7

this Court were to hold that section 5 --
