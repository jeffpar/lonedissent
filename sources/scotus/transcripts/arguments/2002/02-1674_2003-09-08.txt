ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

12

ON BEHALF OF THE MCCONNELL PLAINTIFFS
MR. STARR:

13
14

Mr. Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Title I of BCRA, along with Section 213

15
16

intrudes deeply into the political life of the

17

nation, and does so in a way that not even the most

18

ardently nationalist of the founding generation would

19

have countenanced.

20

intrusion into state and local activity at the

21

grassroots level, but a significant diminution in

22

speech and associational activity by parties,

23

activity that lies at the very core of the First

24

Amendment.

25

resources and power away from political parties, which

The upshot is not only a Federal

BCRA's practical effect is to shift

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

5

1

have long been a source of stability for the nation,

2

and in the direction of First Amendment-protected,

3

but at times ideologically razor-sharp interest

4

groups.
BCRA, in a word, goes too far.

5

There were

6

other ways before Congress that Congress could have

7

employed.

8

concern of Congress was large contributions of

9

non-Federal funds, those regulated by the states,

Most relevantly, to the extent that the

10

then the Hagel amendment was before Congress, which

11

would have put a cap, a ceiling on the level of

12

contributions to the national parties, but preserving

13

the prerogatives of the state and local parties.

14

Secondly, to the extent that the concern

15

was contributions being directed toward issue ads,

16

Congress had before it the Ney amendment, which among

17

its terms provided specifically for the non-use of

18

such funds in connection with issue ads.

19

Thirdly, to the extent that Congress was

20

concerned as it clearly was with the abuses of the

21

recent past, as documented lavishly in the Thompson

22

committee hearings, Congress could and did respond in

23

BCRA, in unchallenged parts of BCRA, namely, 302 and

24

303, addressing specifically fundraising on Federal

25

property, clarifying what had been famously said to

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

6

1

be a lacuna, namely, no controlling legal authority.

2

Also, tightening the prohibitions on a common abuse

3

in the recent past, namely, the involvement and

4

contribution by foreign nationals, the James Riady

5

situation.

6

But Congress chose not to do this.

It

7

rather, in 323(a), chose to ban, ban, not limit, but

8

ban, but also to regulate relationships and

9

associations among the different levels of the

10

parties.

In 323(b), Congress went so far as to

11

regulate state and local political activity that is

12

at the most grassroots level and is documented

13

lavishly in this record, especially with respect to

14

the State of California.

15

indications that there will be a diminution of

16

political activity by the political parties, both

17

parties, both of the major parties, the California

18

Democratic party and the California Republican party.
QUESTION:

19

The record teems with

Do I understand your position

20

that Congress could have provided that there be a

21

strong wall between national and state and local

22

parties so that no funds could be transferred inter

23

se?

24
25

MR. STARR:

No, Your Honor.

It seems to

us that the firewall which was described by Senator

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

7

1

McCain does in fact intrude into associational

2

activity of parties and the structure of parties that

3

this Court has found protected in a variety of cases

4

such as EU v. San Francisco County, Tashjian v.

5

Connecticut.
QUESTION:

6

But what -- what's the speech

7

interest if Congress says there can be no transfers

8

of funds between different levels of the party, what

9

is this First Amendment violation in that?

And in

10

fact, I thought you were suggesting in your earlier

11

remarks that Congress might have done something like

12

this.
MR. STARR:

13

Well, my point earlier was

14

simply to say there were other alternatives that were

15

more narrowly tailored before Congress, but with

16

respect to transfers themselves, the transfers this

17

record show go among to other things to enable voter

18

mobilization at the most fundamental level and

19

activity, and this again is documented most lavishly

20

in California, that is focused upon such as ballot

21

initiatives, quintessential state activity but

22

nonetheless which Congress sweeps in under the

23

rubric.

24
25

QUESTION:

I don't -- I thought that your

response to Justice Kennedy's question was that the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

8

1

right to speak includes the right to speak in

2

association with others.

3

that your brief takes?

Isn't that the position

4

MR. STARR:

5

failed to say that, I say it now.

6

and I clearly did fail to say it.
QUESTION:

7

That is our position.

If I

The whole idea --

But my question was, could

8

Congress allow communications of all type, but not --

9

but forbid transfer of funds between different levels

10

of the party?
MR. STARR:

11

Our position is not

12

non-Federal funds, which by definition are funds that

13

are either regulated or subject to regulation by

14

state law.
QUESTION:

15

May I ask you if you are

16

talking about the right to speak in association with

17

others, does that apply to individuals or does a

18

group have a right to speak in association with other

19

groups?

20

MR. STARR:

This -- I believe it does,

21

Your Honor, but this Court, I don't think has

22

authoritatively answered that question.

23

in Colorado Republican II notes that there are

24

indications in the Court's cases, including

25

California Democratic Party v. Jones to the effect

Footnote 10

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

9

1

that there is in fact an associational right on the

2

part of those who have come together as an

3

association, and that certainly we think is

4

consistent with the teachings of this Court in cases

5

such as Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Party

6

and Tashjian v. Connecticut.
QUESTION:

7
8

It's consistent we have never

held that, have we?
MR. STARR:

9

I think it's fair and accurate

10

to say that you have not expressly held it.

11

the reading, at least, of this Court in footnote

12

10

--

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STARR:

15
16

That's

Mr. Starr?
-- as I read it in Colorado

Republican II.
QUESTION:

Mr. Starr, may I ask whether

17

you are attacking prior law that required an

18

allocation?

19

were home free.

20

activities, there had to be an allocation and in

21

presidential election years, for example, that was

22

heavily weighted on the Federal side.

23

your view constitutional?

24
25

It didn't say that the state parties
It did say when there were mixed

MR. STARR:

Was that in

Certainly an allocation

process, we think, can in fact be contemplated in

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

10

1

terms of assuring that those funds which are subject

2

to state law and state regulation are in fact free to

3

be regulated by the state, and I mean by way of

4

specific example, the people of California, the

5

people of New York have made other contrary

6

determinations than the Congress did with all respect

7

to Congress with respect to certain forms of

8

contributions.

9

QUESTION:

But I don't -- I don't get in

10

what you have just said an answer to a question which

11

would affect New York, would affect California, would

12

affect every state, 65/35, to take a non-hypothetical

13

ratio when there are mixed activities, when there are

14

Federal and state candidates on the ballot.

15

understand the prior law, it didn't count how many.

16

It just made that allocation.

17

constitutional?

18

MR. STARR:

As I

Was that

I'm not saying that the

19

specific allocation was constitutional or not.

20

was not tested.

21

process of accommodation of the state interests is

22

necessary in order, Your Honor, we believe to achieve

23

values of congruence --

24
25

That

But my answer to the question is a

QUESTION:

I think -- I think the question

that Justice Ginsburg is getting at is, I gathered

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

11

1

the statute was passed because, let's call him Joe

2

Wealthy, wants to write a check for $10 million to

3

help his favorite candidate Smith get elected.

4

they figured out a way, who they is is named in the

5

lower court opinion, but we'll just say they.

6

figured out a way despite the prior law to do it.

7

would pay for Get Out the Vote, it would pay for

8

voter registration, and it would pay for issue ads

9

which didn't say vote for Smith.

And

They
It

What they said was

10

Jones, his opponent, is a real rat, go tell him what

11

you think of him, okay.
I mean, all right, now, that was the

12
13

problem.

And the solution is to say one, all pennies

14

spent by the Federal committee are Federal, and

15

though the limitations of $50,000 a year in total

16

apply.

17

wants where there are only state candidates on the

18

ballot, that where there are state and Federal both

19

on the ballot, we will allocate, and then it sets up

20

a highly complex system of allocation, so I think the

21

question that I heard was, if you thought the prior

22

system of allocation which happened to be 60 percent

23

Fed, 40 percent state or a ratio for the state

24

committee, depending on the number of state offices

25

versus Federal offices.

Two, the state is home free, does anything it

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

12

1

If you felt that was constitutional, then

2

why is this new allocation unconstitutional, because

3

as I read through it, it looked like the basic

4

problem is when you get a voter to the polls, you

5

have to have him there to vote for a state candidate,

6

you have to have him there for a Federal candidate,

7

and we are going to allocate the cost of getting him

8

there between hard money, Levin money and maybe some

9

other money.
All right.

10

That's a long question, but I

11

want its addressing specifically what Justice

12

Ginsburg raised, which is why if that first

13

allocation is okay, why isn't this new allocation

14

okay?

15

MR. STARR:

Several responses.

First, let

16

me begin with the beginning of your hypothetical,

17

large contribution from the major donor, the Hagel

18

amendment addresses that.

19

let's limit the contribution which, after all, is the

20

fulcrum of concern, namely, the possibility of

21

corruption, or as this Court articulated in Shrink

22

Missouri PAC in Colorado II, undue influence.

23

Now, with respect, that is

But there comes a point, Your Honor, where

24

Congress goes too far in failing to accommodate the

25

state interest.

There is in short a necessary, under

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

13

1

this Court's jurisprudence, and we believe anchored

2

in the Federal Elections Clause for Congress to

3

assiduously be mindful of displacing state law, and

4

that is what has been done here by virtue of

5

essentially not even trying to effect an allocation,

6

but rather simply saying, including in context where

7

the flow of funds from the national party to the

8

state or local party is in an off-year election.

9

value that we would have left up to the Court is that

10

The

of congruence, proportionality.

11

This goes much too far and Congress could

12

have calibrated much more carefully.

13

-- we're talking about limits, by the way, I think

14

it's fundamental to bear in mind that the limits with

15

respect to Federal contributions are anchored on the

16

idea of a contribution as for the purpose of

17

influencing a state election.

18

is that there is a substantial amount of donations in

19

the system that go for quintessential state election

20

activity, including ballot measures, initiatives, and

21

the like.

22

QUESTION:

When we're talk

What the record shows

But to the extent that you are

23

challenging, your challenge is based on the First

24

Amendment, then state laws that are similar or even

25

more stringent than the Federal law would also form.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

14

1

So on the one hand, you're saying Congress paid

2

insufficient attention to state interests, but on the

3

other hand, your First Amendment argument would

4

require significant revision of some state laws.
MR. STARR:

5

Well, I don't think so, Your

6

Honor, because what Congress has seen fit to do is

7

regulate activity throughout the system, including

8

then a Federal committee's or national committee's

9

relationship with a state and local committee that

10

ends up affecting what the national committee can do

11

in mayoral elections, including in off-year, that is

12

to say, non-Federal elections years.
QUESTION:

13

Of course, some states might

14

choose to make no law abridging the freedom of

15

speech.

16

MR. STARR:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STARR:

Well, it's a quaint idea.
To coin a phrase.
And the Commonwealth of

19

Virginia has that, and it is a very good system of

20

total transparency and it's a very vibrant system

21

that is not infected with corruption or the

22

appearance of corruption in the view of its Governor

23

and others.

24

fact embrace the idea of transparency.

25

this court stated in Buckley that a contribution is a

The Commonwealth of Virginia does in
Why?

Because

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

15

1

First Amendment event.

2

But we have now gone beyond that which Congress has

3

held by this court in Buckley years ago to have an

4

interest in and that is the regulation of

5

contributions for the purpose of influencing --

6

that's the definition -- a federal election.

7

QUESTION:

It does have significance.

I'm still curious about the

8

response, Mr. Starr, to that inquiry about whether

9

your arguments would apply and lead you to think that

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

the pre-BCRA regime is invalid as well.
MR. STARR:

No, we are not suggesting that

the FEC regime was invalid, and we think that -QUESTION:

That nothing about it was, the

allocation and so forth.
MR. STARR:

We're not suggesting it.

The

issue was never authoritatively resolved.
QUESTION:

No, but would your argument

18

lead you to conclude that maybe that scheme that's

19

been there for 25 years is invalid?

20

MR. STARR:

Not at all, because what the

21

FEC did for all those years, and they're settled

22

expectations that were built upon that system, was a

23

recognition of the state's prerogatives.

24

very powerfully expressed in the FEC's 20-year

25

report, which speaks about our Federal system and the

This is

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

16

1

very idea, and therefore, declining to use the

2

pejorative term, quote, soft money, because other

3

states have different attitudes.

4

QUESTION:

But as I understand it, your

5

criterion for drawing the line at what is a

6

legitimate state interest is the proportionality and

7

congruence criterion, is that correct?
MR. STARR:

8
9

I think that is instructive as

to what -QUESTION:

10

And how do you factor into the

11

application of that criterion, the basic argument

12

made on the other side in this case, that if you do

13

not allow what Congress has done here, you are, in

14

effect, allowing a complete end run around the prior

15

law?

16

proportionality?

How does that factor into congruence and
Do we ignore it?

MR. STARR:

17

No, Your Honor, because again,

18

Justice Souter, Congress had before it -- if the

19

problem was these large donations giving rise to the

20

appearance of corruption or undue influence -QUESTION:

21

Large donations or a thousand

22

smaller donations?

The end run problem is exactly

23

the same.

24

the argument that you made, and that is the close

25

association between the state and the national

And one reason I suppose it's the same is

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

17

1

committees.

2

addresses that.

3

And I don't see how your argument

MR. STARR:

But Your Honor, we think it

4

does in terms of simply recognizing the traditional

5

interests of the states that we think is, again,

6

anchored in the Elections Clause itself that Congress

7

simply does not have authority.

8

teaching in terms limits I think is to the sane

9

effect, that Congress simply lacks authority even if

And this Court's

10

it, quote, sees a problem which it has seen in

11

Morrison and Lopez and a variety of cases that

12

Congress can go in our Federal system too far.

13

And that's even in the context of the
And here the Elections Clause goes

14

Commerce Clause.

15

to a quintessential sovereign interest of the states.

16

I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Starr.

Mr. Burchfield, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BOBBY R. BURCHFIELD

20

ON BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PLAINTIFFS

21
22
23

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
Title I is both fatally overbroad in

24

achieving any Federal interest and nonsensically

25

underinclusive.

To paraphrase the Court in National

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

18

1

Conservative PAC, we are not here quibbling about

2

fine-tuning prophylactic measures.

3

challenging fundamental restrictions on core

4

political party activities.

5

in Buckley that no societal interests would be

6

achieved if a loophole closing measure allowed

7

unscrupulous persons and organizations to spend

8

unlimited amounts to influence a Federal candidate.

Indeed the Court noted

Joe Wealthy is George Soros, Justice

9
10

Breyer, who the media reports --

11

QUESTION:

12

We are here

$10,000,000 and Get Out The

Vote --

13

MR. BURCHFIELD:

14

QUESTION:

And totally unregulated.

But we'll see how that works

15

because the second they start conferring with any

16

candidate or they start conferring with the political

17

party, they're going to be in a lot of trouble.

18

guess it still is possible that a person could have a

19

totally uncoordinated private effort to Get Out the

20

Vote and give a lot of money to it.

So I

21

But the general rule of constitutional law

22

and every other law is Congress doesn't have to solve

23

every problem.

24

will turn out to be a big loophole.

25

And we don't know yet whether that

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Correct, Justice Breyer.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

19

1

But we know from Colorado I that not all activities

2

of political parties are coordinated with their

3

candidates and we know from the current regime, from

4

the regime that has been in effect for more than a

5

decade, that all donations to political parties,

6

Federal money, non-Federal money or anything else, is

7

fully disclosed and reported.

8

system that we have had with political parties, the

political parties are accountable and are

So at least under the

transparent.

11

Let me say a few words about the

12

allocation regulations, just to make sure that we're

13

all clear about what the allocation regulations do

14

presumptively more involved in Federal elections

however, that the Federal government may regulate any

contend -- you're exactly right.

The reason that I take it that

(a) says that all money spent by a national committee

is hard money is because Congress is interested in

6

the contribution, not the expenditure.

7

they're saying is if you write a check for one penny

8

or you write a check for 50 billion to the Republican

9

or Democratic National Committee, we assume that that

And what

money is going to be used to affect Federal

elections.

12

Now, you are right that a small portion

is, in fact, used just for state.

15

it's simply too hard for us to know, contribution by

16

contribution, what's going to do what.

17

workable rule here is not to prevent the RNC from

18

using its money on state elections, but to say to the

19

RNC, every penny that you spend because you're a

national committee must follow Federal source and

it's complicated, that the RNC can write a check for

amount is, as long as it's hard money.

13

they're forbidden from soliciting or spending, et

15

about that or not?

16

MR. BURCHFIELD:

It's that

Am I right

The RNC can spend as much

17

hard money in state elections, consistent with state

18

law and in some states, in Connecticut, such as --

19

and that's set forth in Mr. Josefiak's affidavit,

20

where it's not even clear that the national parties

21

can participate because the national -- the Federal

22

limits are higher than the state limits.

are some states where the national party under this

regime is going to be constrained to participate even

25

in state elections --

And then the reason, I take it,

for that is the administrative reason I gave, we're

focusing on the contributions.

5

MR. BURCHFIELD:

And now what is your

The response to that,

6

Your Honor, is that the statute speaks far more

7

broadly than contributions.

9

QUESTION:

Isn't there also an answer to

that general line, that when you're talking about the

10

First Amendment, administrative considerations

11

ordinarily are not good enough.

12

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And

13

it's also worth noting here that the allocation

14

regulations that the senatorial or congressional

15

committees operate under are governed by the actual

16

amounts spent on state and local activity, subject to

17

a percentage of a 60 percent cap.

18

If they don't engage in at least 40

19

percent state election activity, their Federal

20

percentage is higher than 60 percent.

21

allocation ratios are calibrated to address, in the

22

real world, what the parties are actually doing in

23

the state and local realm.

But there's other

administrative conveniences not okay.

8

MR. BURCHFIELD:

9

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

So you can't be relying on the

10

principle that administrative convenience is not

11

adequate.

12

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Justice Scalia, we are

13

not here today to defend the constitutionality of the

14

allocation regulations, but I did sense that there

15

might be some misunderstanding about how they

16

operated, and I wanted to at least make clear that

17

the allocation regulations do not purport -- did not

18

purport to regulate purely state and local candidate

19

activity, at the national party level or at the state

20

party level.

21

A very large proportion of what the

22

California Democratic and Republican parties do was

23

not within the scope of the allocation regulations.

24

Here, under this statute, under section 323(b), the

25

only activities in even years that state and local

California Democratic Party -- are direct donations

to candidates, to state and local candidates, and

5

state party conventions.

Everything else, including a phone bank to

oppose a school voucher initiative such as Prop. 38

that was on the November 2000 ballot, and that's in

10

The -- the difficulty,

11

Mr. Burchfield, that I have with your argument, I

12

know where you are going, but the difficulty I have

13

is in determining what the criterion is going to be.

14

If we accept the Buckley standard, which you do, for

15

the purpose of your argument, then it seems to me

16

your criterion for applying the Buckley standard is

17

similar to what Mr. Starr was getting, getting at.

18

You say it goes too far.

19

over again when we are applying that standard, we

20

don't have a scalpel, and I don't know how we apply a

21

too-far or not-too-far standard.

And we have said over and

you are arguing that, but I also understood your

answer to Justice Kennedy's question to be that even

if we take the lesser, the more relaxed criterion

under Buckley, that you also win and you win on a

standard that it goes too far, and my problem is

assuming all of those things, I don't see how we

apply a too-far standard.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

of all, under strict scrutiny, the Government doesn't

of a basic question, maybe it's assumed here, but

16

directing your attention to 323(a) in the general

unconstitutional, as well as --

2

QUESTION:

I think that's the heart of

3

your position, and I think it's unsupported by our

4

cases.

5

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Well, Your Honor, under

6

the Buckley line of cases, you have never addressed a

7

Federalism issue before because the currently, the

8

currently existing, the pre-existing campaign finance

9

statutes were by their terms limited to contributions

10
11

for the purpose of influencing a Federal election.
QUESTION:

But in a sense, there is a

12

parallel argument there that Buckley says what are

13

the interests that the Government may rely on in

14

restricting speech, and it says the appearance

15

of corruption, corruption, and so in a way, to the

16

extent that the Government gets away from that at all

17

in going to some other interests, you can say it's a

18

Federalist -- Federalism argument, but it's also a

19

First Amendment argument in the sense that if those

20

exist, if those interests are not there, then it's a

21

First Amendment difficulty.

22

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Exactly.

It's a First

23

Amendment issue if the Federal Government is

24

purporting to pursue an interest, an interest that

25

isn't a legitimate Federal interest.

Your Honor, if

I may say -QUESTION:

2

Again, Mr. -- Mr. Burchfield,

3

when I come back to the question I asked Mr. Starr,

4

to the extent that you are relying on the First

5

Amendment, you can't be waiving a Federalism banner

laws just a moment ago, I think you mentioned,

-- being more stringent than

the Federal regulation.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

12

Your Honor, under the

13

prior regime, the Republican National Committee had

14

12 separate accounts that it ran that were in

15

compliance with the various permutations of state

16

law, so that when it wanted to participate in

17

Connecticut, for example, it had

18

Connecticut-compliant money to do so.
Under this regime, it has one account, and

19
20

one account only, and that is the Federal account,

21

and with that, when that account contains donations

22

that are, that are of a level higher than the, than

23

the state it wants to participate in, there is a

problem.

through that.

won, you would find a donor who was wanting to give

want him to be able to write his check for 9 million.

8

Well, you are talking about 9 million I guess out of

several hundred million, so I don't know if you won

10

on that, it would help you that much, if you really

11

got just what you wanted there.

12

And you

But now you are going to the second part,

13

and on the second part, the way Congress has done

14

this is it says, after all, we understand that state

15

parties in an election with Federal candidates on the

16

ballot, have an interest in getting state candidates

17

elected and Federal candidates, and so we will

18

allocate, and I, and then contrary, I think, to what

19

I heard Mr. Starr say, I think they produce one of

20

the most complex allocation systems I have ever read.

21

MR. BURCHFIELD:

22

QUESTION:

They have indeed.

Now, the fact that it's complex

23

doesn't mean it's wrong.

What they are trying to do

24

is balance a lot of different interests, so now you

25

explain to me what's wrong with it, what they've

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

38

1

tried to do is allocate the cost of getting the voter

2

to the polls between some special state money and

3

between Federal hard money, and they have their

4

reasons, I think, as you have seen from the reply

5

brief, for each one of the special restrictions

6

that's in there.

7

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Your Honor, I would be

8

happy to explain, to explain to you what's wrong with

9

Section 323(b) if that is what I understand your

10
11

question to be.
QUESTION:

Well, no, you wanted to bring,

12

you wanted to discuss that.

13

do want to discuss it, I'd certainly be interested.

14

MR. BURCHFIELD:

I'm saying if you want,

I absolutely do, I

15

absolutely do.

What is wrong with 323(b) in the

16

First Amendment realm is that it does restrict the

17

ability of state and local parties, as well as

18

national parties to pool their resources.

19

a question earlier about whether there's ever been,

20

whether there's ever been a recognition of the right

21

to pool resources.

22

65 and 66, the right to join together for the

23

advancement of beliefs and ideas, quote, is diluted

24

if it does not include the right to pool money

25

through contributions for funds are often essential

Absolutely.

There was

The state and local and national parties

plans to get their voters to the polls.

Levin amendment, which is immensely complicated,

7

under the Levin amendment, the committee that spends

8

the money has to raise 100 percent of it, both the

9

Federal component and the non-Federal component.

10

Under the Levin amendment, it is illegal for the

11

national parties to send even a Federal dollar to a

12

state or local party in order to, in order to

13

participate in a, in a joint Get Out the Vote program

14

that the state is funding in part with Levin.

15

QUESTION:

Under the

Now, their reason for that,

16

their reason for that, I take it, is because Joe

17

Rich, who wants to write the check for 6 million,

18

when faced with this statute and the Levin amendment,

19

which allows him to give $10,000 to each district

20

committee, the Western Sunset Block Association of

21

the Democratic Party.

22

thousands of such associations, and since there could

23

be thousands, if they did not have that restriction,

24

all that would happen is that the state committee

25

would write to Mr. Joe Rich and say write the check

The -- there could be

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

40

1

for $6 million to me, and then what he'd do is he

2

would divide that $6 million up among our 10,000

3

local committees, and you see, it would be a hole

4

that is not just an inch wide, but 15 miles wide, and

5

so they threw some sand in those gears.

6

in those gears is just what you described.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

7

And the sand

Well, Your Honor, bear in

8

mind that the Levin Amendment, restricts, the homegrown

9

requirement not just Joe Wealthy's -- sending Joe

10

Wealthy's donation.

It restricts sending Joe Poor

11

Person's

12

$10 donation down to the states.

13

even

14

Federal money, noncorrupting Federal money down to the

15

states.

It restricts sending

In that sense, it certainly goes too far.
But I would also say -- point out with

16
17

regard to the Levin Amendment, Mr. Tamraz, who has

18

made his appearance in these briefs, as he did in the

19

Thompson committee, gave $300,000 to state parties in

20

1996.

21

passed -- one of the reasons they passed this

22

statute.

23

of the 58 California county committees and $10,000 to

24

the California state committee for a total of

25

$590,000 in California.

And that's supposedly the reason they

He can give, in California, $10,000 to each

And that is wholly -- that

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

41

1

is not Federal money.

That is Levin money.

But the national party committees cannot

2
3

transfer even down $10 to the state party for a voter

4

mobilization plan.

5

respectfully submit, Your Honor, that's neither

6

narrowly tailored nor closely drawn, not even

7

rational.

8
9

That is not -- I would

QUESTION:

They're going to say -- there

is still -- the reason -- to get that 10,000 to each

10

of these things, at least they have to act

11

independently.

12

committee independent, and independent even of the

13

Federal money.

14

And they're trying to make that local

MR. BURCHFIELD:

But the consequence of

15

trying to make the local parties independent of each

16

other is that those 58 California parties cannot pool

17

their resources for a statewide Get Out the Vote

18

program, Justice Breyer.

19

Committee on that side of the aisle, the Republican

20

National Committee on our side of the aisle is

21

sitting in the hallway.

22

And the Democratic National

And that is a fundamental wedge between

23

the associational rights, political parties in an

24

area that even Senator McCain admits is fundamental

25

to the democratic process.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

42

1

That is -- if I may just for a moment to

2

expound upon that.

For that reason alone, we believe

3

that strict scrutiny is absolutely essential in this

4

case, and the government confirms that they cannot

5

pass the strict scrutiny bar.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Burchfield, can I just be

7

sure that I understand one thing?

You're saying the

8

Federal -- national committee may not transfer any

9

money to the local committee in that situation.

But

10

doesn't the statute merely say it must transfer hard

11

money?

12

MR. BURCHFIELD:

No, Your Honor.

If the

13

state committee is using Levin money, they can accept

14

no transfers.

15

program must be homegrown.

16
17
18
19
20
21
22

100 percent of their money for that

QUESTION:

Which provision -- you're not

relying on 323(b)(1).
MR. BURCHFIELD:

It is 323 -- and pardon

me because the statute has -QUESTION:

(b)(1) just prohibits transfer

of anything except hard money.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

It's (b)(2)(B)(iv), and

23

323(b)(2)(C).

And (b)(4) and 323(b)(2)(B)(iv), it

24

says the amounts expended or disbursed are made

25

solely from the funds raised by the state, local or

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

43

1

district committee which makes such expenditure or

2

disbursement and do not include any funds provided to

3

such committee -QUESTION:

4

That's a condition to using

5
6

Levin funds.

7

MR. BURCHFIELD:

8

QUESTION:

9

But the basic prohibition in

(b) is just a prohibition on the use of any money

10

other than the hard money.

11

MR. BURCHFIELD:

12

QUESTION:

So it's only if you get to the

Levin Amendment that your argument is relevant.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

15
16

And Congress

recognizes --

13
14

Exactly, Your Honor.

Your Honor, Senator

Levin, when he proposed the Levin Amendments -QUESTION:

17

Let me just be sure we're

18

understanding each other and what the statute

19

provides.

20

MR. BURCHFIELD:

21

QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Is it not true that the basic

22

prohibition in (b) does not prevent a national party

23

from transferring hard money to local committees for

24

any purpose whatsoever?

25

MR. BURCHFIELD:

So long as the local

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

44

1

parties are not using the Levin Amendment, that's

2

exactly right.

3

MR. BURCHFIELD:

4

QUESTION:

But it does prohibit it when

5

they're using Levin money.

6

MR. BURCHFIELD:

7

Levin money, it's a crime.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Correct.

But if they are using

But the statute doesn't require

them to use Levin money, so they do have an option to
transfer hard money to local committees.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

If the entire political

12

process at the state level is subjected to the hard

13

money limits, you're right, Your Honor.

14

Levin, on the day he introduced the Levin Amendment,

15

said that the statute would go too far.

16

too far as written without the Levin Amendment in

17

regulating, quoting, some of the most core activities

18

that state and local parties engage in.

19

Amendment is not --

20

QUESTION:

But Senator

It would go

So the Levin

So it still remains true that

21

the use of Levin funds is an option to the national

22

party, not a requirement.

23

MR. BURCHFIELD:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Well, it was an option --

Is that not correct?
That is correct.

But

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

45

Justice Stevens, it is an option that Congress

2

understood was essential to the vitality of the

statute.
QUESTION:

4

the national party or for the state?
MR. BURCHFIELD:

7

It's not an option for

the national party.
QUESTION:

Excuse me, is it an option for

It's an option for the state

MR. BURCHFIELD:

QUESTION:

So a state party could destroy

party because 323(b) is directed at the national

15

parties.

16
17
18
19
20

MR. BURCHFIELD:

323(a) is directed to the

national parties.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, you're right, it's a

state thing.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

And 323(a), as we've

21

indicated, is an across the board criminal ban on

22

national parties accepting any money that is not

23

strictly regulated by FECA.

24
25

QUESTION:

Strictly regulated means that

they, in order to raise the same amount of money,

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

46

1

they couldn't rely on corporate treasuries, union

2

treasuries and rich donors.

3

spread their effort more widely to reach the ordinary

4

people who support a party.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

5

They would have to

They would have to file a

6

Federal committee, engage in Federal reporting and

7

comply with all the restrictions.
QUESTION:

8
9

But what it would cut out is

the reliance on corporate funds, union funds and

10

wealthy individuals.

The parties would have to

11

spread their efforts more widely, but that's

12

basically what it calls for.

13

there is no ceiling on the amount of the money that

14

they could raise.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

15

There is no limit,

Your Honor, if the only

16

word in 323(a) were receive, you would be right.

17

I respectfully -- I respectfully refer you to the

18

fact that the statute prohibits soliciting,

19

receiving, transferring, directing or spending, and

20

Congress intended meaning to those other verbs -QUESTION:

21
22

can you solicit?

23

transfer?

24
25

But

But if you can't receive, how

If you can't receive, how can you

MR. BURCHFIELD:

You can solicit for

gubernatorial candidates, you can solicit for state

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

47

1

parties, you can collaborate with state parties in

2

spending money the way the political parties have

3

done heretofore in voter mobilization plans.
QUESTION:

4

In which case, the limitation

5

on receiving is simply a formal limitation.

6

Everybody knows where the money comes from, everybody

7

knows what the money is supposed to be used for.

8

that if your argument to Justice Ginsburg is good, I

9

think the argument for regulation is all over.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

10

So

Well, Your Honor, I would

11

respectfully disagree.

12

contribution to candidate lines of cases, putting

13

aside the question that we're talking about

14

contributions to political parties, and not directly

15

to candidates here.

16

candidate line of cases, those cases do not involve

17

solicitation of contributions to others, such as the

18

chairman of the RNC's ability to solicit money for

19

someone running in the California recall election

20

right now.

21

QUESTION:

Under the Court's

But under the contribution to

I don't want you to leave

22

without having a chance to -- but I've listed so far,

23

and so far it's not going to kill the statute.

24

far you're upset about that Roman numeral II -- you

25

know what I'm talking about?

So

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

48

1
2

MR. BURCHFIELD:

The homegrown

requirement?
QUESTION:

3

Roman numeral II on the

4

homegrown which is the Federal contribution to hard

5

money.

That's your strongest argument there, I

6

think.

So you say strike that from the statute.

7

right, we take out Roman numeral II, that's not going

8

to kill the statute.

All

And as far as the first point is

9
10

concerned, at worst, concerning you're completely

11

right -- assuming you're right, you could set up

12

totally segregated accounts for donors who want to

13

give to the Federal party to money that will be used

14

for purely state elections.
MR. BURCHFIELD:

15
16

Am I right about that?
National parties, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

17

Yes, national parties.

You

18

could do that, right, and without hurting the statute

19

too much.

20

to be sure I get down what you think are the biggest

21

three or four overly broad things.

22

Now, is there a third or fourth -- I want

MR. BURCHFIELD:

May I answer as you go?

23

With regard to 323(b), the statute does pervasively

24

regulate state parties from section 323(a) on.

25

our briefs, we set forward the overbroad definition,

In

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

49

1

the Orwellian definition of Federal election activity

2

which is fundamental to section 323(b).

3

believe you can solve 323(b) without going to the

4

very core of the statute.

I don't

5

With regard to section 323(a) and setting

6

up separate accounts, you've described the situation

7

before the statute was formed.

8

ways -- are there regulatory ways that Congress could

9

have gone in more closely or more narrowly and

Now, are there

10

limited the ability of national parties to spend

11

money coming out of those non-Federal accounts, those

12

12 non-Federal accounts?

13

what Congress did here, Justice Breyer.

Perhaps, but that isn't

Congress here adopted an across the board

14
15

criminal prohibition on national political party

16

involvement with any money that is not regulated by

17

the Federal government.

18

far.

19

And that we contend goes too

Now, as to the other overbreadths of the

20

statute, I would simply rely upon what we've set

21

forth in the briefs.

22

QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honors.
Thank you, Mr. Burchfield.

23

General Olson, we'll hear from you.

Sometime in your

24

argument, would you cover the question of whether, if

25

the Court were to strike down 323(a), 323(b) could

survive?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

3

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS
MR. OLSON:

4

Well, we believe it could,

5

Mr. Chief justice, but let me come back to that.

6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

7

Court:
The issues the Court considers today,

8
9
10

every single one of them in connection with Title I,
are not new.
For a century, with the overwhelming

11
12

support of the public, Congress has struggled to curb

13

the corrupting influence of corporate, union and

14

large, unregulated contributions in Federal

15

elections.

16

agreed that achievement of that goal is critical to

17

avoid erosion of public confidence in representative

18

government to -- and I'm using the Court's words --

19

to a disastrous extent.

Time and time again, this Court has

But concentrated wealth is nothing if not

20
21

creative.

As this Court has observed, the history of

22

campaign finance reform has been a cycle of

23

legislation followed by the invention and

24

exploitation of loopholes, followed by more

25

legislation to cut off the most egregious evasions

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

51

1

and circumventions.

2
3

General Olson, is every problem

MR. OLSON:

Well, this Court hasn't found

soluble?

4
5

QUESTION:

every problem to be solvable.
QUESTION:

6

If for example, the executive

7

should make a compelling case that it is really

8

impossible to eradicate crime if we continue with

9

this silly procedure of having warrants for searches

10

of houses?

We wouldn't entertain the argument that,

11

you know, this is the only way to achieve this

12

result.

13

MR. OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

Of course not.
There are certain absolutes,

15

aren't there, even if problems subsist?

There are

16

just some things that government can't do?

17

MR. OLSON:

Of course, Justice Scalia.

18

QUESTION:

And that's what we're arguing

19

here.

20

MR. OLSON:

Of course it is.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

24

that government simply can't do.

25

MR. OLSON:

Not whether there are problems.
Of course it is.
But whether this is something

Of course it is, but this

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

52

1

Court has said over and over again, not only is it a

2

critical problem that's fundamental to the integrity

3

of our election system, but that the solutions that

4

the legislature has enacted before, the central

5

principles of which are embodied in BCRA, are

6

constitutional solutions to that problem.
QUESTION:

7

Let me understand -- to be very

8

basic, let's start with the text.

Congress shall

9

make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

10

Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of

11

speech.

12

some sense.

These laws abridge the freedom of speech in

Now, on what basis do you think that there

13
14

is somehow a way around that text?

15

several ones.

16

doesn't mean all freedom of speech.

17

freedom of speech which was traditional at the time

18

the provision was adopted.

19

you could not give information about the sailing of

20

troop ships and whatnot.

21

under that.

22

expenditures for campaigning when the provision was

23

adopted.

24
25

I can think of

You can say the freedom of speech
It means that

So you could not libel,

But this wouldn't come

There was no notion of restraining

A second alternative, I suppose, is that
the freedom of speech does not include freedom of

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

53

1

speech by malefactors of great wealth, corporations,

2

labor unions and other organizations don't have

3

freedom of speech.

4

can't require The New York Times to be -- you know,

5

any organization that is funded by more than a

6

million dollars cannot say anything about elections.

7

We couldn't say that, could we?

8
9
10

But our cases reject that.

We

So how do you get around the very simple
text of the First Amendment?
MR. OLSON:

What Congress has done is read

11

the decisions of this Court from 1976, and including

12

the earlier decisions, that specifically said and

13

have said over and over again, that the regulations

14

of contributions, contributions where you're talking

15

about contributions, not expenditures.

16

has said the regulations of contributions to the

17

Federal election process by unions and by

18

corporations may be controlled by Congress in Federal

19

legislation, in connection with Federal elections.

20

This Court has said that over and over again.

21

this Court said in Buckley --

22

QUESTION:

This Court

And

That's plausible, I suppose,

23

that a contribution to somebody else, to speak

24

whatever he wants, is not your speech.

25

you do about expenditures?

But what do

This law regulates a lot

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

54

1

of expenditures.
MR. OLSON:

2

This law, referring to Title

3

I, makes certain contributions illegal to the

4

Federal -- to the national parties and to their

5

conduits and surrogates.

6

corporations in excess of certain limits.

7

it says that once it said that the contribution is

8

illegal, the solicitation of the contribution is

9

comparably illegal.

Contributions from unions,
Of course

And the expenditure of that

10

contribution, not any amount of money that the

11

Federal or state committees might want to spend, but

12

the use of that money from that source in excess of

13

those limits.
QUESTION:

14

But the reason for upholding

15

the contribution limits restriction was because of

16

the corruption or appearance of corruption between

17

the contribution and the candidate.

18

Buckley supports the proposition that Congress can

19

willy-nilly regulate any sort of contributions in

20

connection with an election campaign.
MR. OLSON:

21

I don't think

Of course not, Mr. Chief

22

Justice.

What this Court has said over and over

23

again, that Congress can regulate contributions from

24

corporations -- the treasuries of corporations and

25

unions.

Separate segregated funds still exist so

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

55

1

that those contributions from members can be made,

2

and that Congress can regulate the amount of those

3

contributions.

4

And that's -- all three of those aspects were

5

addressed by this Court in Buckley and have been

6

addressed again and again and again.

That's all that Title I of BCRA does.

QUESTION:

7

You say that is all that it

does.

It regulates contributions to parties and the

9

argument is that's quite different from a

10

contribution to a candidate, which is one of the

11

issues here, it seems to me.
MR. OLSON:

12

In fact, Buckley did regulate

13

the amount of the contributions by corporations and

14

unions and in excess of certain levels to parties as

15

well.

16

to the candidate, but there were limitations in

17

Buckley with respect to the amount of expenditures

18

that an individual might make in consultation or

19

coordination with a candidate and there were

20

aggregate limits with respect to the $25,000 limit

21

that was set for the precise reason, this Court

22

explained, to avoid circumvention of the limits in

23

connection with the --

25

There was not only a 1,000 contribution limit

QUESTION:

Contributions to parties were

limited that way?

56

1

MR. OLSON:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

The

2

aggregate contribution by parties and the Court

3

talked in terms of the aggregate contributions that

4

could be made all together by the individual, and the

5

court specifically talked about that, that $25,000

6

limit was for the very purpose of preventing the

7

individual to circumvent the contribution limit to a

8

candidate by giving money to the party which would

9

then be given to the same candidate, and the court

10

specifically said in Buckley that that would be

11

unearmarked money that would go to the party, which

12

would then go to the candidate.

13

QUESTION:

14

But what about a contribution

to the party, we'll call it a payment to the party?
MR. OLSON:

15

A contribution, Justice

16

Kennedy.

I don't think I understand the question,

17

because the court specifically talked in terms of the

18

corrupting influence of corporate union and

19

uncontrolled large money contributions and what this

20

Court said then and has said over and over again that

21

Congress can attempt to avoid circumvention of those

22

permissible limits.

24

out and reported in the Thompson report.

25

evidence of abuses is that enormous amounts of

so-called soft money, which is just another way of

2

saying money that is prohibited to go to Federal

3

elections, was going to Federal elections through

4

various surrogates, through the national party.

5

QUESTION:

Is, is there evidence in the

6

record of access corruption, so to speak, using soft

7

money to fund purely state and local elections, as

8

opposed to Federal?

9

MR. OLSON:

The evidence --

10

QUESTION:

Is there evidence of that?

11

MR. OLSON:

What the evidence, if I

12

understand your question correctly, is that the money

13

was going from, through the national parties and at

14

the direction of the national parties to the state

15

subordinate committees in order to fund various

16

activities that had to do with Federal elections, and

17

that's what, they were --

QUESTION:

If I understand, evidence that

the money being used to fund purely state and local

election activities?

MR. OLSON:

was concerned about.

No, that was not what Congress
Congress was concerned -But the ban extends to that,

Federal election activity.
MR. OLSON:

Well, it is, it is broadly

defined, but it has been defined by the experts in

10

this country on elections, the corruption of big

11

money, the regulation and the potential abuses.

The incumbents were doing very well under the

I can go on.

The millionaire

MR. OLSON:

Justice Scalia --

Let me -- let me -- there are

several answers to that.
QUESTION:

7

One, this Court's --

Let me finish my thought.

What

8

I conclude from this is that perhaps we shouldn't be

9

so deferential to Congress in this matter.

You know,

10

in the area of separation of powers, we do not defer

11

to Congress when Congress is in a head-to-head clash

12

with the executive branch on separation of powers

13

matters.

14

in that area.

15

is eminently self-interested in making laws that

16

restrict the manner in which people can challenge

17

their re-election?

18

Why?

Because Congress is self-interested
Why is it not the case that Congress

MR. OLSON:

There are several answers to

19

that question.

First of all, that very issue was

20

addressed in 1976 in Buckley and the court said that

21

the rules are applying equally to anybody running for

22

office, and in that circumstance, the court will look

23

to evidence of invidious discrimination against

24

challengers.

25

discrimination against challengers.

There is no evidence of invidious

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW

Number two, the evidence supports

2

overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get

3

re-elected under the old system just fine and that

4

overwhelming amount of evidence is not in the record,

5

in the testimony below, which is summarized in, in

6

various different sources that the repeated testimony

7

by Senator Thompson, Senator McCain, former Senator

Simon and over and over again abuses in the system

9

that were not benefiting incumbents but were tearing

10

down faith of the American people in a system of

11

government and making people believe that the more

Too much money.

That's the problem.

MR. OLSON:

shows and the Federal Election Commission came out

20

with a report earlier that year that candidates are

raising more money this year.

22

23

corrupting influences and that the hard money, in

24

fact, has benefits to the party and to the

25

candidates.

It's not the amount of

so-called soft money.

4

42 percent of the amount of money that the national

5

party spent on election activities, up from 9 percent

in 1984, 42 percent.

7

percent came from just 800 donors.

15

MR. OLSON:

Or that more went to

I don't have a breakdown of

16

that, Justice Breyer, but what the evidence does

17

show, if you go back election by election, every two

18

years, that incumbents under the old system, if a

19

member of the House of Representatives decided to

stand for re-election, the statistics year after year

are the same, 97 to 98 to 98.5 percent of the

solving here?
MR. OLSON:

2

No, no, Justice Scalia.

But

3

it directly addresses the question that you raised to

4

the extent that Congress was looking for a scheme to

5

protect incumbencies, they were doing very well.

would be hard to develop a scheme that could be

7

better for incumbents.
QUESTION:

8
9

It

General Olson, I suppose

another reason why we should not defer to the

10

incumbents is they have an interest in spending their

11

time working for the public rather than raising

12

money, and this will save a lot of time so that we

13

shouldn't defer to them on it, no.
MR. OLSON:

The -- that's, well, Justice

QUESTION:

Of course, of course -Water will run downhill, and if

5

you cannot make your voices heard in this fashion,

6

they'll find another fashion.

7

MR. OLSON:

What this Court said in

8

Buckley, in Shrink Missouri Government, in every one

9

of the cases that this Court has considered is that

10

those are indeed abuses that those are corrupting

11

influences, and the word abuse was Justice Starr's

12

practically, Justice Starr's first word, I mean

13

General Starr's first word out of his mouth.

14

everybody's word when it comes to the system.

15

guess you'll have to wait.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. OLSON:

That is
I

General Olson -It was everybody's word when

18

they described this system, when you talk about the

19

enormous amount of money that was avoiding the direct

20

regulatory scheme and going through various

21

surrogates to accomplish the same thing.

22

QUESTION:

One feature of this is puzzling

23

to me, and that is if the candidate corruption is

24

what, or the officeholder corruption is the heart of

25

it, we don't want candidates, officeholders to be

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW

generous to candidates and officeholders than it was

to the parties.

That's -- I'm speaking now,

Justice Scalia, in the terms of the statute itself.

MR. OLSON:

I suppose that would be up to

10

some level of reasonable prosecution, prosecutorial

11

discretion.

12

QUESTION:

Well, is this the sort of thing

13

we ordinarily have, I can see in the tax code, but

14

ordinarily we don't have in a connection with the

15

First Amendment some very debatable thing that might

be this, might be that.

17

MR. OLSON:

Well, it's actually relatively

18

clear, Mr. Chief Justice, the regular -- not only are

20

does the statute specifically address the abuses that

21

were well-documented and their evasions.

I'm talking about the official

that the same thing goes for contribution to a 501(c)

that the candidate for Federal office can make that

solicitation, but not an officer of the party.

18

MR. OLSON:

There, there are indeed some

19

of those areas where there are refinements because

20

Congress was concerned with the -- this Court has

21

said repeatedly that political parties are, have

22

special advantages.

23

that there are special rights and special privileges,

24

and so Congress was concerned with the immense

25

possibility, the immense power of national political

3

the use of money going to the national parties to

4

circumvent these things.
QUESTION:

5

So Congress was

I thought we were talking about

6

corruption.

Surely the possibility of corruption is

7

much more direct when it's the candidate himself who

8

was soliciting for this organization, which will then

9

help him.

Then it is indirect, where the national

10

party solicits and it may get to him or not.

11

doesn't know what's going on.

12

MR. OLSON:

He

It's entirely possible that

Congress has not solved every potential abuse of

Federal election law and that the lawyers will be

back before this Court with another piece of

legislation.

evidence of abuse of that nature, Justice Scalia.

Congress did not have before it

QUESTION:

But it went out of its way to

allow incumbents to do this.

It didn't leave a gap.

let the parties do this, but we will let the

22

candidates do it.

23

MR. OLSON:

Went out of its way.

It made some, in my judgment,

perfectly understandable exceptions for individuals

in certain things, as opposed to the massive power of

2

the party.

3

QUESTION:

If we found that this law had

4

the purpose or the effect of giving significant

5

advantage to incumbents, would we have to strike it

6

down under the First Amendment?

7

MR. OLSON:

Well, the challenge was the

11
12

I

I

guess we would be concerned.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is a First

Amendment interest in protecting incumbency?
MR. OLSON:

I think that that would be a

14

very serious concern, Justice Kennedy, but there is

15

not any evidence of invidious discrimination, to use

16

the language of this Court in Buckley.

17

QUESTION:

But you say in your brief and

in Mr. Waxman's brief, you indicate that Buckley has

to be revised because speech has evolved in a way

that Buckley didn't anticipate.

QUESTION:

3

Step back for a second.

Because, say, looking at it more broadly, I think

we're hearing many arguments of this form, which is a

serious argument, it seems to me.

quite restrictive in the many ways that have been

mentioned.

When you look at

At the same time, there are no

restrictions on the press, and at the same time, you

12

can give as much money as you want to the NRA, to the

13

NRDC, to every interest group that supports both the

14

Republicans or the Democrats or whatever.

15

that will happen is that the power and the money will

16

shift to those groups, and you will have precisely

what Madison called faction, because the parties act

as a tempering device.

shifted the power from the party to the special

interest group.

to hear a general response to that kind of an

72

argument.
MR. OLSON:

2

The distinction was made by

3

this Court in Buckley and in the subsequent decisions

4

that there is a higher level of scrutiny and a

5

greater level of concern with respect to the amount

6

being given to an individual and a greater identity

7

and potential for abuse, because that money can then

8

be spent either directly by the individual or in

9

coordination with the political party on the

10

individual's reelection, if individuals go out and

11

affiliate with this group or that group and spend the

12

money.

13

That's not subject to the same kind of

level of control by the party or the candidates and

it is looked at --

segment from the brief that I quoted, the party and

4

the candidates are, in one extent, one and the same.

Congress focused on the fact

6

considerable privileges, the power to put candidates

on the ballot.

8

this enormous power can be subject to greater

restrictions.

There is reasons that the exercise of

10

Congress was, one, looking at where the greatest

11

abuses were.

guidelines set by this Court.

13

And then number two, following the

QUESTION:

In Colorado I, we said that the

14

corruption rationale did not seem -- seemed quite

15

attenuated in connection with the parties.

16

MR. OLSON:

With respect to independent

17

expenditures, the Court said that.

18

Court addressed the coordinated expenditures and

19

approached it in quite a different way, and held that

20

coordinated expenditures in Colorado II could be

21

treated just like contributions.

22

And then the

And the difference is that the Court has

23

held, quite understandably, that the level of concern

24

that Congress might have over abuses from

25

contributions is greater, and the level of First

Washington, D.C. 20005

74

1

Amendment concern is more attenuated because that

2

contribution may be used in a different way,

3

depending upon the contributions.
QUESTION:

4

There are two steps.

Why is a

contribution or payment to the NRA any less a

contribution than a payment to the Republican Party

in certain instances with certain candidates?

8

equate -- the statute equates, and so I think you

9

must.

You equate parties and candidates.

10

MR. OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

You

In the first place -This is a remarkable

proposition.
MR. OLSON:

13

Well, it is the same

14

proposition that is discussed in Buckley in

15

connection with the aggregate contribution limit, and

16

is discussed several times in the cases that come

17

along since Buckley.
The party is a different entity.

18

The NRA

19

or any other of the many organizations that might

20

spend their money for this in a way that the

21

candidate cannot control would not be focused in the

22

same way.

23

that the parties, because they're so closely

24

identified with the individuals, and such a source of

25

potential circumvention, are something that the

This Court provides the guidance that says

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

75

1

Congress may legitimately be concerned with.
And this legislation was developed as a

2
3

result of six years of intense investigation, debate,

4

testimony, delicate compromises, all conducted in the

5

context of congressional elections and a presidential

6

election.

7

people who, over and over again, talked about the

8

level that abuses had come to.
QUESTION:

10

This was a product of a lot of time by the

All done by incumbents,

incidentally.
MR. OLSON:

11

Well, we pass laws in the

12

United States, Justice Scalia, by people who already

13

hold office.
QUESTION:

14

That's true, but they usually

15

don't pertain to what it takes to get them out of

16

office.

17

MR. OLSON:

What this Court has repeatedly

18

said is that congressional judgments -- and I can

19

only quote the language of this Court in Buckley.

20

Congress could legitimately conclude, speaking in

21

terms of potential for corruption.

22

in 1982, a unanimous Court said that careful

23

legislative adjustment of Federal electoral law in a

24

cautious, advanced, step-by-step, warrants

25

considerable deference.

In the NRWC case

We accept -- this is a

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

76

1

unanimous Court -- Congress's judgment that it is the

2

potential for such influence that demands regulation,

3

nor will we second guess a legislative determination

4

as to the need for prophylactic measures where

5

corruption is the evil feared.

6

If the Court were to look at the long

7

series of the summary of abuses in Judge

8

Kollar-Kotelly's decision below, and to look at the

9

testimony given by former Senators Rudman and Simon

10

and Boren and the other individuals who describe what

11

it's like, the breakfasts, the lunches, the

12

receptions, the dinners, the endless cycle of

13

campaign finance.

14

QUESTION:

The attack ads.

The

15

legislative record is full of hostility toward these

16

attack ads.

17

MR. OLSON:

Justice Scalia, the parties

18

and the candidates can spend all of the hard money

19

they want on attack ads or any other types of ads.

20

Congress was focusing there, with respect to specific

21

types of legislation, in connection with the use of

22

state money, soft money that comes to the state

23

parties, in conjunction with elections taking place

24

at which Federal officials are on the ballot.

25

QUESTION:

General Olson, you said a

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

77

1

moment ago, referred to the testimony of Senators

2

Rudman and Simon and Boren about you know,

3

breakfasts, lunches.

4

permissible basis for a restriction, that you know,

5

we're tired of having to go to these breakfasts and

6

lunches.

That I don't believe is a

MR. OLSON:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't

8

mean to say that these numbers were saying it was too

9

much work.

What they were saying is that the

10

relentless pursuit of big contributions was

11

innervating to the political process.

12

QUESTION:

The record

That is not a -- that's what

13

the Chief was saying.

14

We've never said that's a valid justification.

15

That is not a valid complaint.

MR. OLSON:

The potential for

16

indebtedness, the feeling of indebtedness, the

17

selling of access.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

That's why they didn't want to

go to breakfasts and lunches.
QUESTION:

I don't understand why that --

21

by just saving time for government work is not a

22

valid interest anyway.

23

MR. OLSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

--

Of course it is a -Why should they waste all their

time raising money.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

78

1

MR. OLSON:

Of course it is a valid

2

interest, Justice Stevens, but what all of these

3

individuals were talking about was the appearance and

4

the actuality that the system had been corrupted.

5

The access --

6

QUESTION:

Is there a feeling of

7

obligation and access to an organization which

8

delivers a million votes on its own?

9

QUESTION:

Of course there is, Justice

10

Kennedy, but the First Amendment considerations as

11

articulated by this Court address the infusion of

12

money from particular sources, either from wealthy

13

individuals or a corporation -- corporate treasuries

14

or unions differently.

15

And what all of this testimony was about

16

wasn't how much time it took, was that money had

17

become the number one operative driving force, not

18

only in the running for office, but for the entire

19

period that the individual was in office.

20

And that the political parties -- and the

21

evidence was abundant, lavish -- that the political

22

parties themselves were saying if you give this

23

amount of soft money, we will set up meetings with

24

these members of Congress or these leaders of the

25

party or this opportunity to spend a night in the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

79

White House or whatever.

2

how things get done in Congress was something -- was

3

not only for sale, but also perceived to be for sale.
QUESTION:

4

The actual access which is

Of course many people think

5

that what produced that situation was the original

6

campaign finance law, which set individual

7

contribution limits so low that you indeed had to go

8

around scurrying for money, because you couldn't

9

accept greater amounts from more wealthy donors.
MR. OLSON:

10
11

that.

The contribution limits have been increased.

12
13
14

Well, there is two answers to

QUESTION:

Insignificantly, if that is the

But what this Court has said

problem.

15

in Buckley, and has also said over and over again is

16

to the extent that the candidates and the parties

17

have to reach out to more individuals for more

18

participation rather than relying on this 800 or so

19

individuals that give large amounts of money.

20

better for the candidates and it's better for the

21

parties and it's better for the political process.

22

QUESTION:

Don't mind having to spend all

23

the time raising the money.

24

that that's bad.

25

That's

I thought you just said

Now you say it's good.

MR. OLSON:

What -- what I'm, what I'm

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

80

1

saying, Justice Scalia, is what this Court has said,

2

that to the extent that a larger numbers of smaller

3

contributors, that you don't need to spend all this

4

much time courting is a better process for the

5

political system.

6

that's what this Court has said over and over again.

That's what this Court said, and

QUESTION:

7

General Olson, could I ask you

8

to address the regulation of state parties and the

9

regulation of funds spent in state elections.

What,

10

what basis is there for the Federal Government to do

11

that?

12

MR. OLSON:

The, the legislation refers to

13

money that is spent in Federal election activity.

14

This Court has repeatedly said starting in the 19th

15

century that the control, the regulation of Federal

16

elections is quintessentially important to what

17

Congress does.

18

that this money, that, that the individuals, my

19

opponents are talking about having to do with state

20

elections were when Federal candidates were on the

21

ballot and money was being used ostensibly for

22

neutral purposes, but for the primary purpose of

23

bringing out voters to vote in a Federal election and

24

to influence the outcome of that election.

25

What Congress had abundant evidence

QUESTION:

But that isn't what the law

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

81

1

says, that when it's ostensibly for the -- if you're

2

using it in the best of good faith to get out the

3

vote for a state election, even when the Federal

4

election in this particular state is a forgone

5

conclusion.

6

up that the Federal election is a nullity, and all of

7

the money is being spent on a state election.

There is -- one party has it so locked

8

MR. OLSON:

9

QUESTION:

What -Nonetheless, the Federal

10

Government says these are the rules under which the

11

state party can spend money.

MR. OLSON:

And the state party can spend

unlimited amounts of money that's, that's in

connection with an election.

I didn't mean to interrupt you

in your sentence.

But my question to you was going

7

to be, do you deny that a, that in a situation that

8

Justice Scalia describes, that there may be an

9

as-applied challenge whereas the possibility of that

10

situation does not necessarily carry a facial

11

challenge?

12

MR. OLSON:

That's correct.

And this

13

Court has said again and again to the extent that

14

there's an overbreadth challenged in the context of a

15

facial attack on a statute, the statute must be

16

substantially overbroad.

17

as-applied challenges to particular aspects of this

18

legislation.

There may be particular

MR. OLSON:

There is more than one.

But Justice Scalia, what the

23

-- what Congress was looking at is that the huge

24

amounts of money being used at the time of elections

25

where Federal candidates were on the ballot,

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

83

1

political parties, and whether they be state parties

2

or national parties are going, are not going to pour

3

enormous amounts of resources into elections at which

4

there is not much of a context, a contest.

5

parties can spend all of the Federal, the hard money

6

they want with respect to those activities and then

7

the Levin amendment, which was not required by the

8

Constitution, not necessary, but that gave an

9

additional ability of the state to use under certain

10

circumstances soft money, unregulated by the Federal

Government in those contexts.

The bottom, at the bottom, what this

13

legislation does is treat the very same abuses that

14

this Court was concerned about in Buckley v. Valeo,

15

and has said repeatedly are the types of concerns

16

that are legitimate for Congress to be concerned

17

about and to use the words of this Court, go to the

18

very fundamental integrity of our government.

19

only thing in Title I that Congress did was to

20

control the source of contributions, unions and

21

corporate treasuries, and the amounts above a certain

amount, and a potential circumventions of those

limits.

ON BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-DEFENDANTS

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issues before the Court in connection
with Title I and the rest of this legislation raise

10

the most fundamental challenge for any, for any

11

representative democracy.

12

Court, beginning at least with Justice Frankfurter

13

and the United Auto Workers case and extending

14

through this Court's opinion in Shrink Missouri and

15

Beaumont, has recognized that is the imperative of a

16

representative democracy to retain the confidence of

17

the individual citizens with whom we all share the

18

franchise, that their vote counts, that big money

19

doesn't call the tune, and that when Members of

20

Congress and the President and Vice President make

21

decisions on our behalf, they do so because they

22

think it is in the best interest of their country and

23

our judgment as constituents and their own judgment.

24
25

It's a challenge that this

And there was reference paid, reference
made to the testimony of members of this, of

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

85

1

Congress, respected members like Senator Simpson and

2

Senator Rudman, and it is very important to focus on

3

what those Senators said under oath.

4

Simpson testified, he testified that too often,

5

members' first thought is not what is right, or what

6

they will believe, but how it will affect

7

fundraising.

8

that a $100,000 donation does not seriously alter the

9

way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an

issue?

MR. WAXMAN:

13

He was -- his declaration is,

14

his sworn declaration is in the joint appendix,

15

Mr. Chief Justice, in the first volume.

16

speaking in general and about all of us, and so, too,

17

was Senator Rudman when he testified under oath that

18

large soft money contributions distort the

19

legislative process because they affect whom Senators

20

and House members see, whom they spend their time

21

with, what input they get, and make no mistake about

22

it, this money affects outcomes as well, and millions

QUESTION:

He was

Mr. Waxman, wasn't there

considerable dearth of evidence as to something a

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

86

1

little bit different, which are a quid pro quo?
MR. WAXMAN:

2

There was, there was a

3

concession in this case that give, that there is no

4

specific evidence that a particular vote was changed

5

because of a particular donation, but of course,

6

that, too, was not true in Buckley v. Valeo.

7

v. Valeo, this Court made reference to the findings

8

of the D.C. Circuit which dealt exclusively with

9

excess access by the milk producers and others and

Buckley

10

ambassadorships and the record in this case so

11

overwhelms the record before this Court in -- in

12

fact, it overwhelms by several orders of magnitude

13

the factual records that existed in Buckley and all

14

of its progeny.

Now, Justice --

It certainly doesn't mean

So is this corruption?

87

1
2

corruption?
MR. WAXMAN:

The giving -- this Court has

3

said that corruption in the Buckley sense is the

4

influence of large donations on the judgment and

5

behavior of officeholders, and Justice Scalia, there

6

is a mountain of evidence from experts, members,

7

lobbyists, 60 pages of findings from Judge

8

Kollar-Kotelly and almost as many from Judge Leon

9

that access buys influence, and there are any number

10

of ways that cannot be statistically observed to

11

change outcomes besides a particular vote.

12

QUESTION:

I think that's the bottom line.

13

That's the moment of truth.

14

the money that you contribute to the candidate?

15

you don't get that, you are getting nothing.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

Do you get any votes for
If

You can go back and overrule

17

Buckley v. Valeo, and every other one of these cases

18

you have decided because that has never been proven.

19

It is very difficult to prove, and what Cong -- what

20

Congress needs to aim at, it needs to aim at the

21

willingness of the hundreds of millions of people out

22

there who think that their vote counts and think that

23

Members of Congress will be responsive to them and

24

who are justifiably cynical when they see that in the

25

last presidential election, $500 million that law

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

88

1

does not permit to be used for Federal election

2

purposes was used for that purpose as the political

3

party's own expert, Professor La Raja acknowledged

4

that it almost all was used for Federal election

5

purposes.
This goes right to the question, it goes

6
7

right to Justice O'Connor's question about state

8

parties and I think the Chief Justice's question

9

about the national ban, and I'd like to address those

10
11

first.
QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, before you do, do

12

you have an answer to the argument put to General

13

Olson by Justice Breyer that if you don't allow the

14

parties to play in the soft money league, then the

15

money will go elsewhere.

16

independent, sometimes highly ideological groups.

17

will go to the NRA, for example.

things even worse than they are now.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

It will go to the

Yes.

It

And that would make

I have, I have several

20

questions and that, that was my, the next point I was

21

going to address after the first two, which is, it is

22

wrong on about 10 different levels, but the bottom

23

line is if it turns out to be an abuse, that is, if

24

it turns out to be a phenomenon that creates

25

corruption as this Court defined it, either in the

this afternoon, Congress can take care of the

problem.

The one thing that --

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Muzzle them, muzzle them, too.
The one thing --

That's the solution.

MR. WAXMAN:

The one thing that we know

11

for certain, Justice Scalia, in this uncertain world,

12

there is at least one thing that is certain, and that

13

is that the people who enacted BCRA and the people

14

who populate the House and Senate, if they find that

15

the national political parties are being

16

disadvantaged or losing their central role, not only

17

in our political system, but in our system of

18

governance, they will be there to address it.

19

General Olson --

20

QUESTION:

But that's just, that's just a

21

political calculation?

22

constitutional standing for parties to protect their

23

capacity to formulate policy?

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

There's no first, there's no

To be sure, Justice Kennedy,

and if it were impaired, Congress could and would

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

90

1

address it.

The data already shows that this year

2

the parties have raised more in hard money alone than

3

they raised in the last presidential election in hard

4

and soft money, and they are right on a trajectory to

5

raise $1.5 billion in hard money for all of their

6

activities.
QUESTION:

7

Well, your, your response to

8

Justice Kennedy suggests that the parties exist by

9

the leave of Congress.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Surely that isn't the case?
Well, it, my argument doesn't

11

depend on if the, the parties, of course, aren't

12

mentioned in the Constitution, but they are a

13

fundamental aspect of our system of representative

14

government, and I, I meant to cast no aspersions on

15

the fact that they play a role not only in electing

16

candidates, but also in organizing in particular the

17

legislative process and the conduct of legislative

18

business.

19

My only point is that we can be certain

20

that if something comes to pass that our experience

21

so far shows is not going to come to pass, Congress

22

can come to their aid or someone can come to this

23

Court, but the fact --

But our experience in

about the good of the parties than the parties

6

themselves are.

7

think it's hurting them.

9

They are on the other side.

MR. WAXMAN:

8

They are on

They

There is, there is no

question that the, that telling the national

10

committees of the, the national committees of the

11

national parties that you are now required to accept

12

only funds that are subject to the limitations,

13

restrictions, and reporting requirements of the

14

Federal election, Federal law is a limitation and it

15

requires them to accommodate it.

16

that you cannot strike this law down on its face

17

based on a Chicken Little prediction that something

18

that by all accounts is not happening at all does

19

happen.

20

I'm only saying

And the notion that corporate and union

21

money is just going to flow from, these corporations

22

that gave a million dollars to each party at the same

23

time, is going to flow to the National Rifle

24

Association or the National Abortion Rights League, I

25

think mistakes the important laudable role that the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

92

1

parties play, and mistakes the fact that the

2

evidence in this case is that those contributions

3

were strong-armed.
You look at the testimony in the record

4
5

and the amicus brief of the business officials, these

6

people were not dying to spend millions of dollars to

7

both political parties, in order to support

8

democracy.

And the notion that they are going to go

NARAL, I think has no basis in the record.
QUESTION:

11

And it's also, I suppose,

12

unlikely that they would contribute both to the NRA

13

and also to a gun control organization, which they

14

do --

15

MR, WAXMAN:

I'm not sure that that's

16

true, but however they choose to use their

17

shareholders' resources, I think is up to the

18

democracy of shareholders.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, these people, these

20

independent groups make independent expenditures.

21

the party side, once a candidate has been nominated,

22

is there practically any such thing as an independent

23

expenditure, as opposed to a coordinated expenditure

24

by a party?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

On

I have been told that there

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

93

1

are ways to read this court's opinion in Colorado

2

Republican I and II, to limit that distinction.

3

is, the concept of an independent expenditure to the

4

one which the Court was presented, which is a

5

circumstance in which the party, in that case the

6

Colorado Republican Party, didn't have a nominee.

7

And therefore, it was rather difficult for it to be

8

coordinating.

But I believe that --

QUESTION:

9

That

There is another distinction,

10

too.

11

there applied to both hard and soft money.

12

only talking about prohibitions that did not involve

13

hard money.

14

That case, the prohibition on expenditures

MR. WAXMAN:

That is correct.

We're

And this

15

does go to the point that the Chief raised and

16

Justice O'Connor raised about 323(a) and 323(b) that

17

I hope I will be able to address.

18

parties, you've heard the quote from Mr. Burchfield.

19

He was simply stating the obvious which is, we are

20

talking here, as the act defines it, about national

21

parties that organize themselves in national

22

committees, state committees and local committees.

23

On the state

And all of those parties, all of those

24

committees act together to elect their slate of

25

candidates.

And it is my friends on the other side

Washington, D.C. 20005

94

1

of this case and not us that demean the role of the

2

state and local committees by essentially attaching

3

their activities to races for dogcatcher and state

4

assemblymen, when in fact, they play the central role

5

in our system in identifying, grooming and supporting

6

candidates for Federal office.
The candidate on the Ohio ballot for

7
8

Republican for Senate is nominated and placed there

9

by the Ohio Republican Party.

And you asked about

10

the Tamraz or Riatti contributions and what evidence

11

there was about it.

12

were not in place, that is, there were just a

13

national -- the national committees are out of the

14

soft money business, most of the poster children in

15

the Thompson committee report, Mr. Riatti in '92,

16

Mr. Tamraz, Carl Lindner, the Hudson Indian gaming

17

casinos.

18

Thompson came up with.

19

The evidence is that if 323(b)

All of the greatest hits that Senator

Those were people that gave money to the

20

state and local parties in exchange for benefits that

21

they perceived from Federal officeholders.

22

QUESTION:

You said a moment ago,

23

Mr. Waxman, that the Ohio Republican candidate was

24

placed there by the Republican state committee.

25

what if a state has a primary?

Well,

I mean, if a state

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

95

1

has a primary, it's the result of the primary

2

election that places them on the ballot, not the

3

state nomination.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, to be sure.

And my

5

point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that to understand why

6

Mr. Burchfield was correct in saying that this

7

problem, this massive loophole had to address the

8

state and local committees, you need to -- it simply

9

reflects the reality that those committees, at least

10

before they became under the big soft money regime,

11

what one expert called offshore banks of the national

12

committees, they play a very important role in

13

selecting who are going to be the Federal candidates.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman --

15

QUESTION:

A very minor detail while

16

you're on it.

17

national committee can't give hard money to a local

18

district using Levin funds?

19

why is it not possible to have a segregated account

20

for a national party in which a person would put in

21

money that was only going to be used to give to the

22

state for elections where there was no Federal

23

candidate on the ballot?

24

matters I just want to get your response to.

25

What is technically the reason why a

MR. WAXMAN:

And the second thing is,

Those are two detailed

As to the former, we don't

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

96

1

think that the contribution, the soft money

2

contribution ban is subject to strict scrutiny, and

3

therefore, the fact that there may be some other way

4

to sort of carve out money that's given to the

5

national committee purely for state elections is a

6

constitutional deficiency.

7

But the argument -- the complicated point

8

that Mr. Burchfield was making about how the Levin

9

Amendment works was simply mistaken.

10
11

It was mistaken

in several respects.
First of all, there is no prohibition --

12

first of all, the Levin Amendment is an option.

13

each state and local committee doesn't want to have

14

it, they don't have to use it.

15

it, nothing prevents them from spending it together.

16

They just can't transfer money, this soft Levin

17

money, from one committee to another to essentially

18

recreate the problem that existed before, which is

19

phenomenal amounts of soft money all being

20

transferred to a few battleground elections.

21

This is important.

If

And if they do use

A national committee

22

official may -- and the FEC has confirmed this

23

repeatedly -- may in his official capacity, under the

24

stationery of the national committee, solicit funds

25

up to the hard money limits for any state and local

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

97

1

candidate or any state and local committee.
That is, it is simply false that a member

2
3

of the Republican National Committee cannot raise $25

4

to support Haley Barbour's candidacy.

5

they can do it in their official capacity up to the

6

hard money limits into an account that Haley Barbour

7

-- a Federal account that Haley Barbour has set up

8

and would need to set up in any event under 323(f)

9

and 323(b).
QUESTION:

10
11

They can.

And

Even if the state committee has

chosen the option?
MR. WAXMAN:

12

This is -- yes.

This is hard

13

money.

14

for a local committee that's chosen to use the Levin

15

soft money, the law permits the national committees

16

to send hard money to that local committee, provided

17

it is not the money that creates the specific match

18

for the allocation.

19

And in fact, the national committees, even

And the notion that -- a wedge is driven

20

in the midst that sort of creates a rift in this

21

integrated national organization is simply wrong.

22

QUESTION:

It's a pretty big loophole, I

23

guess, isn't it?

I mean, they write and say, Joe

24

Rich, give your 6 million to the following 500

25

committees.

They write 50 checks of $10,000 each.

MR. WAXMAN:

No, the homegrown -- the

so-called homegrown requirement -- I realize the

3

Levin Amendment provisions are technical.

4

reason that you are not allowed to do that, and that

5

goes again to the point -QUESTION:

6
7

That's not homegrown, my

example.
MR. WAXMAN:

8
9

There is a

That's not homegrown.

And it

goes to the point about why there couldn't be or

10

perhaps why didn't Congress just say let's create a

11

separate account for the national committees, which

12

is that the people who gave these huge contributions,

13

the corporations and unions, did not care where it

14

went.

15

They cared what it bought them.
And the notion that if a member of the

16

national -- if Terry McAuliffe comes to somebody and

17

says, we really need $6 million, it's just going to

18

be used for state and local elections, but we really

19

need it, that just recreates the problem that

20

Congress was trying to address.

21

Now, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that in

22

the course of that rambling discourse, I answered

23

your question about the national ban.

24

didn't, I would love to address myself to it.

25

But if I

was for you.
MR. WAXMAN:

I believe it is, but out of

respect for the Court and in an effort to be

8

responsive, I won't treat it as such.

9

solvable and as this Court's jurisprudence shows in

No problem is

this area, no solution is permanently solvable.
We have a dialectic going on here between

preserve a sense of integrity and faith in the

process.

about the sort of capillaries of the system, but very

little talk about the core of it.

18

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BOBBY R. BURCHFIELD

19

ON BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PLAINTIFFS

20
21
22

MR. BURCHFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Time permitting, I'd like to make three

23

brief points.

The first is Section 323(a), the

24

across-the-board criminal prohibition on national

25

parties can be well contrasted with Section 323(e),

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

102

1

which addresses Federal officeholder solicitation.

2

In 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for

3

Federal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up

4

to the analogous Federal limit for state and local

5

candidates.

6

national party officials, and the conclusion that all

7

of my clients have reached is that national party

8

officials are unable to raise non-Federal money, even

9

up to the analogous Federal limit if it goes into a

There is no similar allowance for

10

state party, a state candidate's campaign account

11

because that account is not regulated by Federal law.
Number two, and to go to Justice

12
13

O'Connor's question, the potential effect of

14

corruption, the potential corruptive effect of such

15

donations is minuscule, nonexistent, attenuated at

16

best, in the words of Colorado I.

17

by the way, that the RNC spent in state and local

18

election activity in 2001 was 30 percent of the

19

non-Federal money the party raised that year, 30

20

percent.

21

any degree.

22

The $15.6 million,

It's not an insubstantial amount in any, to

Second point, with regard to Section

23

323(b), which is the restrictions on state parties,

24

the corruptive potential of donations to state and

25

local parties for use in Get Out the Vote activities

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW

directed to state and local candidate elections is

2

again minuscule, at best attenuated, in the words of

3

Colorado I.

4

polls on November 8th, is swept within the definition

5

of Federal election activity.

6

send out hundreds of different mailings every year

7

throughout their states urging voters to go to the

8

polls and those mailings mention only state and local

9

candidates.

But that activity, if it says go to the

The California parties

That activity is swept within the

10

definition of Federal election activity and is now

11

federally regulated activity and that, in that

12

respect 323(b) goes well beyond a congressional

13

interest in eliminating corruption of Federal

14

candidates and officeholders.
Final point, and that is with regard to

15
16

Section 213.

The only illusion to that was with

17

regard to the coordination of activities among the

18

national parties and, and the candidates.

19

addresses two different uses of Federal money, hard

20

money.

21

irrevocable choice to make coordinated expenditures

22

under the statute, Section 441a(d) or their

23

constitutional right to make independent expenditures

24

recognized by this Court in Colorado I.

25

Government, and this is very important, the

213

It puts the parties to a single unified

The

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

104

1

Government has never advanced any anti-corruption

2

rationale to put the parties to that choice.

3

only rationale we've gotten is Congress can condition

4

the statutory right simply because it's Congress.

5

There is no suggestion that using hard

The

6

money for one is more corrupting or is corrupting in

any way than using hard money for the other.

there are no questions by the Court.

16

If

MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

As we turn from Title I to Title II, we

18

turn to efforts by Congress to limit, to regulate,

19

and ultimately to punish what are only expenditures,

20

expenditures not made in coordination with parties or

21

candidates which would result in them being treated

22

as contributions, but independently, and so we deal

23

here this afternoon in an area which as this Court

24

observed in Colorado II, it has routinely struck down

25

expend -- any limitations in this area.

We are all

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW

agreed here that strict scrutiny applies.

2

no dispute about that, and I think we're all agreed

There is

I'd like to start with just a few
observations of -QUESTION:

Do you take the position that

no effective regulation of electioneering
communications is permissible?
MR. ABRAMS:

I take the position that

12

electionary communications as defined in the statute

13

is so overbroad that the totality of what is

14

encompassed in it is not regulatable.

15

communications includes within it express advocacy,

16

what is now or what had been subject to regulation,

17

and to that extent, it is subject to regulation.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Electionary

Beyond express advocacy, do you

concede that anything can be regulated?
MR. ABRAMS:

I thought very hard about

21

that, Justice Souter, to see if there was something I

22

could give you in that respect.

23

that there is anything beyond express advocacy.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, I do not concede

Do you also recognize that

express advocacy is the easiest thing in the world to

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

106

1

avoid?

You just say everything about how great your

2

candidate is or how terrible the opponent is, except,

3

and go to the polls and vote for X.
MR. ABRAMS:

4

I understand that that

5

happens.

I understand what this Court in Buckley

6

understood just as well, when it said almost the same

7

thing.

8

advocacy was going to catch most, not to say all --

The Buckley Court did not say that express

10

with two words, relative to.

with this problem as all.
MR. ABRAMS:

But Buckley Court was

13

prescient in understanding that what has happened was

14

going to happen.

15

express advocacy covers would not be enough to cover

16

the range of conceptions, people, and organizations

17

and unions and corporations and others could come up

18

with.

That is to say that what, what

QUESTION:

20

MR. ABRAMS:

21
22

Well, I understand -And when they balanced the

First Amendment interest against that -QUESTION:

I understand why you would want

23

to keep what one of the briefs calls this impregnable

24

line because then you are within Buckley, but it

25

seems to me that this distinction is just

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

107

1

meaningless, that the findings below, in Judge

2

Kollar-Kotelly's opinion make it clear that this is

3

just, this is just a silly distinction in many cases.

4

Why don't we just junk it and begin with there, begin

5

anew, and begin anew?
MR. ABRAMS:

6

It seems to me that, that

7

there are only two choices, that I would urge on you

8

at least, are constitutional choices.

9

adhere to Buckley and to do so, understanding that,

10

or accepting, excuse me, that express advocacy is as

11

far as the First Amendment will allow you to go in

12

terms of allowing regulation.

United States, why should that speech be entitled to

108

1

less constitutional protection than a speech urging

2

the ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty, for

example?

4

MR. ABRAMS:

The only reason and the only

5

justification is that that speech becomes, as it

6

were, so much like a contribution, so much like a

7

final act of saying, vote for the candidate, not for

8

this reason, not by inference, not by suggestion, but

9

that by finally giving an unambiguous statement --

QUESTION:

But you'd therefore get less

11

constitutional protection.

saying, I think.

13

MR. ABRAMS:

That's what you're

It was afforded that little

14

sliver, and it was intended to be a sliver, as I read

You're saying the only reason

is that Buckley said so, and so we'll stick to it.
MR. ABRAMS:

No, I'm not saying it's the

QUESTION:

Maybe it's more likely to

nature of it might, as Justice Scalia suggests, might

be more like -- I'm sorry.

MR. ABRAMS:

Well, speech law has, if

anything, become more protective since Buckley in the

110

1

First Amendment area.

And if, if you were to move in

2

either direction, I would certainly urge you to move

3

in the direction of affording more protection to the

4

direct advocacy that Justice Stevens asked me about,

5

rather than less protection for the ad that I

provided you with, Congressman Myrick, this is from

Now, that is swept in as part of

electionary communication.

11

urge you if you have any inclination to move in the

12

direction of moving away from Buckley, and there's no

13

doubt that, that there are parts of Buckley

14

in tension with each other, that if you were you to

15

do that that you ought not to allow to be swept in

16

the unprotected area advertisements like that.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

are constitutional, then it's pretty hard for me to

see any additional burden on any of these

6

organizations to make this expenditure on the ad you

are worried about through a PAC.

of saying, go through the PAC, and what we achieve by

that is limiting the amount of money that any one

individual can give, and what we lose by it is

nothing.

12

MR. ABRAMS:

QUESTION:

14

Now, what's your, what's your

response to that?
MR. ABRAMS:

15
16

You mean --

My first response is that you

lose a lot of speech.

17

QUESTION:

Why?

18

MR. ABRAMS:

Why?

Because there much less

was to take money out of politics, if you will.

21

don't raise as much money as the AF of L have.

-- that although it's all right

go to Joe Moneybags and say Joe Moneybags, you can

4

only give $100,000 every two years to the Democratic

Party, it's not all right to go to Joe Moneybags and

6

say Joe Moneybags, you can only give $100,000 a year

7

to the AFL-CIO or the pharmacies or somebody for the

8

purpose of running a similar ad.

9
10

MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Well --

In other words, you can limit

11

Joe Moneybags when he gives the money to a political

12

party, whose whole objective is speech and politics,

13

but you can't limit Joe Moneybags when he gives the

14

money for the same type of activity to another

15

organization.

16

MR. ABRAMS:

Well, my side of the table,

17

Your Honor, has not exactly advocated limiting Joe

18

Moneybags and giving money to the Democratic Party.

19

That's what they're saying.

20

is that as regards an organization, either the, we

21

call the ACLU, the AF of L, whichever one you want to

22

pick, there are burdens that this Court has

23

recognized, serious burdens with having a PAC.

24

is also in this case a level, a level of falsity that

25

the entity would have to engage in with respect to

What I'm saying to you

There

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

113

1

what it was doing, because it is not true that this

2

is all about politics.
We have put before you advertisements

3
4

which are not simply political advertisements, and

5

yet to solicit someone for a PAC you must notify the

6

person of the political purposes of the PAC.

7

must spend the money only for political purposes.

8

These are requirements in Section 441b with respect

9

to a PAC.

You

It is not so that the ACLU when, if it

10

wants to run an ad in the last 60 days of the 2004

11

campaign criticizing President Bush for his position

12

on civil liberties, an ad that would be criminal

13

under this statute if it came from its treasury

14

funds, it is not true that that is a political ad.

15

Now, our friends here say, well, it might have

16

effect, and that's something I want to talk about.
QUESTION:

17

Why couldn't the ACLU simply

18

call its PAC the non-partisan issue-oriented PAC?

2

notify anyone solicited of its political purposes.

3

What I'm arguing to you is that -QUESTION:

4

And he couldn't say, our

5

political purpose is to be non-partisan, we are

6

interested in the issue, not the candidate?
MR. ABRAMS:

7

No, I don't think it is

8

telling someone of political purposes if you say, we

9

are not, we don't have political purposes.
QUESTION:

10

You mean the FEC would say,

11

ACLU, sorry, you can't do that, you have to otherwise

12

identify your PAC?
MR. ABRAMS:

13

I don't know what they would

14

do under this criminal statute.

15

the ACLU ought to have to run the risk of the FEC

16

passing judgment.
QUESTION:

17

I do not think that

Would they get an advisory

opinion from the FEC and then they would avoid the

risk?

2

MR. ABRAMS:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but -If they want to clarify what

that they are not advocating the election of a

It takes at least weeks and
There are new organizations

QUESTION:

16

But your basic point is that

17

they're not going to be able to raise as much money

18

as the organization itself has at its disposal

19

anyway, whatever you call the PAC.

20

MR. ABRAMS:

The NRA -- let me give you an

21

example.

The NRA raised an enormous amount of money

22

in the last campaign.

23

the floor of Congress with great unhappiness by a lot

24

of people.

25

America.

They were mentioned a lot on

They appealed to 80 million gun owners in

They have 4 million members.

Under the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

116

1

standard rules that apply with respect to a PAC, they

2

could only get money from the 4 million people, not

3

from the 80 million.

4

raised $300 million.

5

QUESTION:

They could not raise -- they

Basically that -- I didn't

6

mean to interrupt you.

7

MR. ABRAMS:

Go ahead.
Sorry.

I'm finishing it.

8

They raised $300 million from their ads on television

9

and spent it on more ads to get out their views.

And

10

number one, I think that's part of living in a

11

democratic society.

12

to go down from the sort of level they were at, in

13

terms of the people they may appeal to, which is the

14

way PACs work and quite properly the way PACs work.

15

Number two, to say that they are

But that they must, as a matter of law,

16

abandon their general efforts to raise money from the

17

public, is a very significant burden on speech --

18

QUESTION:

I'm not quite clear on that.

19

Why is that -- I thought all they had to do was, if

20

they want to raise money for these kinds of ads, 60

21

days before the election, mentioning the candidate's

22

name, is in their advertising, they say, please send

23

your check to the NRA Election Time PAC.

24

have to do more than that?

25

Do they

I thought they had to open a bank account,

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

117

1

they have to appoint somebody a treasurer, they have

2

to make disclosure.

3

there between over $250 rather than over $10,000.

4

And that's it.
MR. ABRAMS:

5
6

And it's a slight difference

And they're only allowed to

solicit from their membership.
QUESTION:

7

In other words, you can't go

8

and ask -- if I start a PAC or anybody here starts a

9

PAC, you can't go and just ask the general public to

10

belong?

11

MR. ABRAMS:

QUESTION:

13

MR. ABRAMS:

QUESTION:

Can you ask them to join the

Can you ask them to join the

16
17

No, the general public --

QUESTION:

No.

The general public may

But can the NRA go out and say,

21

look, we want you to join the NRA, X dollars.

22

also want you to give the PAC some money, Y dollars.

23

Can they do that?

24
25

MR. ABRAMS:

We

Yes, they can get people to

join the NR --

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

118

1

QUESTION:

If they can do that, then your

2

argument boils down to the fact that when people are

3

told that they have to join, and the money is going

4

to be used for this purpose, they're going to be less

5

interested in doing it.

6

entitles you to a preferable advertising break, in

7

effect, in the name of the First Amendment.
MR. ABRAMS:

8
9

And I don't know why that

Look at the burden on speech

that we are talking about imposing on an organization

10

like this.

Instead of making general appeals to the

11

public, instead of having their say, their argument

12

in saying, send us money, et cetera -QUESTION:

13

Yeah, but your general appeals

14

to the public, it seems to me, are to join the NRA.

15

And therefore, the universe of people who are

16

financing the advertisement is limited to members of

17

the NRA.
MR. ABRAMS:

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

It is limited to members of

the NRA.
QUESTION:

So it's the same limitation as

on the PAC.
MR. ABRAMS:

No, sir, the general appeal

to the public is not limited to the NRA.
QUESTION:

But the appeal to the public is

not just to make this ad.

It's to join the NRA and

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

119

1

get all the benefits of membership, which include a

2

magazine and all sorts of other things.
MR. ABRAMS:

3

But people were free, until

4

this statute, to send contributions to the NRA.

5

were free to send money, not just to join.
QUESTION:

6

They

So what the interest at stake

7

here is the nonmembers of the NRA who want to support

8

the policies of the NRA?
MR. ABRAMS:

9

Yes, the difference is

10

between the 80 million people who have guns and the 4

11

million who are now members.
QUESTION:

12

I assume that there is a

13

membership fee that goes along with joining most

14

organizations.

15

the campaign, you would have to contribute 50, in

16

effect, to join the NRA, plus the 25.

So if you want to contribute $25 to

QUESTION:

Yes.

So my impression is -- this is

19

a question of the record, really.

20

the point.

21

kind you're recommending.

22

overly broad because they're the genuine issue ads.

23

So I put this on the one side.

24
25

And I see you have

I mean, there could be burdens of the
And it also could be

And then I put on the other side that if
we strike it down -- well, I mean, I wouldn't say

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

120

1

forget the whole statute, but it seems pretty close

2

because you get several hundred million dollars to

3

run exactly the same ads that are being run right now

4

which were about $500 million worth of these ads

5

saying -- they don't say vote against Smith.

6

say, tell Smith what a rat he is.

7

they -- and it will just be a loophole about 50 miles

8

wide.

They

That's what

And all this money, instead of going to

10

the Democratic National Committee or the state

committee or something, go right to the NRA, right to

12

the environmental groups, right to the Right to Life

13

groups, right to the groups the opposite -- in other

14

words, everyone who has a cause will get the money

15

and run the same ads that really this was designed

16

to -MR. ABRAMS:

17

Well, everyone who has a

18

cause may get more money, yes.

19

same ads as the political parties would have run?

20

No.

21

would have run?

22

either.

23

Will they run the

Will they run the same ads as the candidates
I don't think you can assume that

I mean, the only thing in your record,

24

incidentally, here, about a breakdown in this area,

25

and I think this may be of interest to you, is that

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

121

1

in the 2000 presidential campaign, of all the ads on

2

television, 51 percent were by candidates, 41 percent

3

were by parties and 8 percent by organizations of the

4

sort that we are talking about here now.

5

QUESTION:

Would you clarify something in

6

the record for me?

7

impression with regard to the NRA, that there

8

basically were two pots of money, the PAC money and

9

its own money, and its own treasury, if it had wanted

10
11

Because I was under the

to spend its own money.
You're telling me the real vice in this is

12

that there is a third category, namely money

13

solicited from gun owners who are nonmembers, but

14

could not belong to the PAC.

15

that third --

16

MR. ABRAMS:

Now you say that

No, I'm not.

I'm saying that

17

what you call their own money includes money obtained

18

by solicitations.

19

QUESTION:

But that's to join the NRA.

20

There is not a separate fund --

QUESTION:

MR. ABRAMS:

It's to join --

Contributed to by gun owners.
It's not a separate fund.

24

No, I'm not suggesting it's a separate fund.

saying that the totality of the amount received by

the NRA includes membership fees and other amounts

request like this.

Is that it?

That's what goes into their

Is that the way it works?

MR. ABRAMS:

I'm not telling you that the

QUESTION:

MR. ABRAMS:

QUESTION:

I'm telling

That's the functional result?
Yes.

Would you agree with the

15

implication of Justice Breyer's suggestion that in

17

Amendment rights under section 2?

18

work the other way around.

stricken because there is a First Amendment

20

violation, and Title I becomes meaningless.

21

MR. ABRAMS:

I suppose it could

Section 2 must be

We thought of putting section

22

2 first in the brief.

I don't think that you can

23

justify, Justice Breyer, striking down or even

24

viewing more harshly, that is to say, our arguments.

25

That is to say, you ought not to reject our arguments

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

123

1

about Title 2, whatever you do about Title 1.
QUESTION:

2

What is directly worrying me is

3

I think that Title II will make you go through PACs

4

to run certain ads.

5

bit more than a handful, that are genuine issue ads.

A handful maybe, maybe a little

And to the extent that you have to go

6
7

through the PAC, that is an added burden and I've

8

been trying to pin that down that you've been very

9

helpful on.

At the same time, there may not be too

10

many.

And it may open a tremendous loophole in

11

what's been traditional, the corporations and labor

12

unions do not and cannot contribute to getting people

13

elected, at least not through spending money and

14

contributions at -- you know what I'm referring to.

15

And also, it might open a major loophole

16

where Joe Moneybags makes the contribution to the

17

labor union or to the corporation that he previously

18

is now forbidden to give to the party itself.

19

are the two things and you've got the first half

20

addressed, and I would like to hear the second two.

21

MR. ABRAMS:

Those

I would like to start by

22

saying that you mentioned the question of the amount

23

of ads in question.

24

the internecine warfare we've had about quite what

25

the number is.

I'm not going to get involved in

But I do want to indicate that we

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

124

1

have one judge, Judge Henderson, who has indicated

2

that it is at least 34 percent of all the ads are by

3

any standard, quote, genuine, unquote, and perhaps as

4

high as 64 percent.
You have other judges and entities on

5
6

their side of the line that have used figures like 14

7

percent and the like.

8

inconsistent with the notion of what express advocacy

9

is.

Now, all this of course is

But taking even their definitions, as it was,

10

we're talking about a statute which by any standard

11

ever used by this Court would be deemed to be

12

overbroad.

13

You can't - I mean to say -- you used the

14

14 percent number. 14 percent of these ads -- and I

15

think there are many more.

16

in the ordinary course would be considered, quote,

17

genuine, unquote,however we define that.

18

sustain a statute which would -- and I use the word

19

deliberately -- criminalize them.

20

QUESTION:

14 percent are ads which

And yet

Is it plain from the record

21

that when a -- and I just don't remember this, but I

22

remember the terms.

23

to this question.

24

discussions, the term genuine issue ad meant an ad

25

that dealt with issues to the exclusion of any

But I don't remember the answer

Is it plain that in these

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

125

1

reasonable interpretation that it also dealt with

2

advocacy for candidates?
Because most of these ads, I think

3
4

everybody would agree, are hybrids.

5

really do address issues, and there is also a very

6

clear implication about what they want you to do in

7

the ballot booth.

8

possibility of a ballot booth implication?

So does genuine exclude the

MR. ABRAMS:

9

Sure, they

Let me say the word genuine

in which they asked students from a particular

brief and at the back of the intervenor's brief.

2

You've looked at these pictures.

3

Tell us, now, is this a genuine ad -- an

4

ad genuinely directed at an issue or is its purpose

5

electoral?

6

now -- did not permit for a moment an answer of both.

They did not.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ABRAMS:

9

QUESTION:

To answer you directly

Yeah, it was a false dichotomy.
Absolutely.

And because it was a false

10

dichotomy, I don't know what to make of 7 percent or

11

14 percent.
MR. ABRAMS:

12

What I think you can make is

13

this, is that if given no opportunity at all to say

14

both, they said that the purpose, in their mind, was

15

not electoral, but issue oriented.

16

give us at least that.

17

--

QUESTION:

19

evidence, wasn't it?

20
21
22

I think you ought to

I mean the both -- the both answer

This was the defendant's

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, sir, yes.

It was the

Defendant's evidence.
QUESTION:

I must confess that I don't, I

23

don't really understand, it's more, what is the

24

purpose of an issue ad unless it is to persuade the

25

voter to take some action that will enable that issue

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

127

1

to carry the day, and the only action a voter can

2

take is to vote for one person or another person.

3

mean, isn't every issue ad an appeal to voters?

4

MR. ABRAMS:

5

QUESTION:

No.

I mean, what -- what other

6

purpose does it have?

7

money in their will, or what?

9

The very first issue ad that

we have at the back of our brief is one by a term

10

limits organization.

11

QUESTION:

12

Is it asking them to leave

MR. ABRAMS:

8

I

Like the Belotti situation, the

Belotti case.
MR. ABRAMS:

13

Well, yes, and it brings that

It's a -- it's term limits organization

14

to mind.

15

saying, we have our pledge, our term limits pledge.

16

There are two candidates.

17

The other one has.

QUESTION:

19

MR. ABRAMS:

20

it.

22

Right.
Call him and tell him to sign

Call David Wu, urge him to sign it.
QUESTION:

21

One has not signed it.

Now, I --

So it's designed to have an

effect upon the election, isn't it?
MR. ABRAMS:

23

I think that one is probably

24

not.

I think that one is a, is a group that cares

25

less about elections than about their cause, their

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

128

1

cause is term limits.
QUESTION:

2

Boy, but you could have, you

3

could have fooled me.

They want the term limit

4

because they want, they want somebody to vote for

5

someone other than Wu.

6

that?

7

in which you've got a, in effect a referendum going

8

on in which the voters are going to have a direct

9

choice, a ballot initiative kind of thing, but once

I mean, how else can you read

I mean, I can understand a Belotti situation

10

you get into a situation in which the so-called issue

11

ad is in the context of an election, I would suppose

12

you would have a tough road to hoe to prove a pure

13

non-electoral purpose.

14

MR. ABRAMS:

People do call -- I'm sorry.

15

The record before you shows that when these ads run,

16

people do make the calls.

17

that in the deposition I took of him.

18

do you get calls?

19

get calls.

20

respond to this very directly, that many of these ads

21

do have both qualities, that is to say, they speak

22

about an issue, and they have an electoral component

23

to them, and some of them don't, but many of them do.

24

And we would urge on you that for you to say that an

25

ad of that sort is not fully protected by the First

I asked Senator Feingold
I asked him,

And the answer was yes, they do

Now there's no doubt, and I want to

1

Amendment, not just in the abstract, but to be

2

applied as you consider a statute like this, the

3

David Wu ad.
Whatever one concludes the underlying

4
5

purpose was, and one can't know for sure to say that

6

a term limits organization cannot take an ad out in

7

the last 60 days of a campaign, and indeed it works

8

out to be over 120 days in a presidential contest in

9

the sense of 60 days with respect to the election

10

date, 30 days for the national convention, 30 days

11

also for state conventions, primaries, so you are

12

talking about 120 days minimum --

Mr. Abrams --- of silence.

Can I interrupt you with a sort

of a --

17

MR. ABRAMS:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- basic question here?

The

19

definition of electioneering communications appears,

20

I think, six or seven times in the statute and one

21

says there must be certain disclosures and other --

22

MR. ABRAMS:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

There must be something in the

24

ad itself identifying the sponsor.

It prevents

25

foreign nationals from contributing to these ads and

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

130

1

so forth.

2

in all its applications, specifically, for example,

3

the requirement that they disclose who paid for the

4

particular ad?

5

Do you contend that it's unconstitutional

MR. ABRAMS:

Your Honor, my client is not,

6

has not raised constitutional objections in this

7

Court to the disclosure requirements and, with the

8

exception of 504, which is a broadcast --

9

QUESTION:

And how about the reporting

10

requirement, the requirement that they report to the

11

Commission who the sponsors are?

12

MR. ABRAMS:

Similarly there --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ABRAMS: -- but that is not because,

No objection --

15

since you ask, it's not because we don't think that

16

the definition is unconstitutional for the same

17

reasons every time it's used.

18

that this definition, put Buckley aside for the

19

moment, that this definition is fatally overbroad for

20

First Amendment reasons.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ABRAMS:

I mean, if we're right

In all its applications.
Yes.

If it sweeps in so much

23

more than the First Amendment --

24

QUESTION:

25

But the requirement that is

imposed by the definition in some instances is merely

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

131

1

disclosing who paid for the ads.
MR. ABRAMS:

2

That's true.

And that's one

of the reasons that we did not raise in this Court an

4

issue about disclosure now.

But you should --

But when you say overbroad, you

mean it's too broad to be constitutional.
MR. ABRAMS:

15

Constitutionally overbroad,

16

yes.

I think one can make a case, and again, we

17

didn't challenge the foreign part of it at all that

18

there may be different considerations afoot there

19

which would perhaps change the dynamics of your

20

decision making.

21

basic disclosure matter that although we, that is to

22

say, Senator McConnell, does not challenging that,

23

the ACLU is challenging it, and they have made that

24

argument in their brief and they have made it at

25

length and powerfully to the effect that the

I do want to point out that on the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

1

disclosure requirements as per Buckley should be the

2

same as the requirement or the viability of a

3

requirement not to say something, as well as certain

4

principles of anonymity.

5

argument that we're making.
QUESTION:

6

As I say, that's not the

Your principal challenge is to

7

the requirement that these ads be paid for with hard

8

money?

9

MR. ABRAMS:

That's one way to say it,

10

Justice Stevens.

11

principal objection is that this is a content-based

12

restriction on speech which punishes speech of --

The way I would say it is that our

that it identifies who or who may not pay for it.

QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that PACs

I'm not talking about PACs,

using hard money as an alternative.
MR. ABRAMS:

Well, hard money, it's really

20

the equivalent of PACs in this situation.

I mean,

21

hard money when you talk about the AF of L, for

22

example, what is hard money when they spend their own

money on their own ad?

have to do it through a PAC.

12

the other sections we're challenging is Section 305,

which is the section which says under the title,

limitation of availability, of lowest unit charged

15

for Federal candidates attacking opposition.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Earlier this term in the Nike case, the

AFL-CIO took the unusual step of filing an amicus

18

in public access to information and ideas leaves the

19

Government no room to inhibit business corporations

from speaking out on matters of public concern.

I want to know the other half of the

22

equation, that is, I'd like you to spend one minute

23

explaining to me why I'm wrong in thinking that if

24

you win on this point, that thing that's been there

25

in the statute since 1919, we might as well throw it

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

137

1

away, and or, you know, they'll make expenditures in

connection with an election, namely these huge ads,

3

and they will collect loads of money from the same

4

wealthy people to help them along with those

5

expenditures.

6

at your convenience.

7

MR. GOLD:

I'd just like one minute on that point

I'll do it now, Justice Breyer.

8

The prescription of expenditures in the law which

9

dates back to the 1940s was first defined by this

10

court in Buckley and then in MCFL to mean express

11

advocacy, and that in fact is the only kind of

12

expenditure that the law has prescribed, and there is

13

only one instance where this Court has even approved

14

a restriction of those kinds of expenditures on any

15

party or any kind of organization that is subject to

16

203, and that was of course the Austin case.

17

notion that expenditures in an untrammeled sense or

18

an unbounded sense -QUESTION:

19

But the

Well, they've given you a new

20

definition, and that's the issue, of course, is this

21

new definition okay, and we are back to where we

started.

in the '40s, why isn't the new one okay given the

problems of the '90s?

All right.

But anyway, you go

MR. GOLD:

Well, it wasn't clear really in

2

the '40s what the term expenditure met.

There were

3

two cases, the UEW case and the CIO case, that

4

explored that and pointed out that there was some

doubt there.

subjective aspect of it, I think, that the Buying

12

Time studies underscored, I think the defendants no

13

longer subscribe to.

14

And this record shows the

But the evidence in the record is replete

15

with instances where groups use ads not even in the

16

mixed sense that Buckley said was very important, but

17

in the sense of doing something that's urgently

18

necessary for the organization at the time.

19

example, three AFL-CIO ads that ran in quick

20

succession in September 1998 denied, in Barker and

21

Spearmint, all addressed legislation that the

22

Republican majority on issues of grave concerns to

23

the AFL-CIO had hastily scheduled, and we came up, we

24

devised ads in a few days' notice and broadcast ads

25

in a number of states in order to pressure particular

4

September of 1998 rather than say September of 1999,

6

when this prescription would not have been upon us.
QUESTION:

7

It

But could -- could I interrupt

8

again?

You're not really prescribed for money in

9

them, you're really prescribed from using union

10

funds, and one of the reasons for that is that some

11

union members may disagree with your position.

12

MR. GOLD:

Well, this makes -- there's a

13

tremendous difference between the union doing it and

14

the union having to do it from a PAC.

15

union, for example, to do this sort of spending out

16

of its PAC would reverse the notion that this court

17

has followed in a series of cases from Machinists v.

18

Street through Beck that the dissent of a union

19

member on matters is not to be presumed, that people

20

don't have to opt in to speaking, that they, at best

21

one can require somebody to opt out.

22

QUESTION:

And to force a

Yes, but from the Taft-Hartley

23

Act on, it's been understood, I thought, that one

24

objection to the union's spending its own money was

25

it may not reflect the views of all its members.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

140

1

That's true of issue ads and election ads.
MR. GOLD:

2

Well, in Austin, when the Court

3

addressed this in the context of business

4

corporations, it pointed out that there were crucial

5

differences between corporations and unions on

6

precisely this point, that the two governmental

7

interests.
And the only case where this Court has

8
9

ever approved an actual restriction on express

10

advocacy, the two interests identified there are the

11

two aspects of the entity there, namely aggregation

12

of wealth -- or the immense aggregation of wealth by

13

virtue of the corporate forum, not aggregation of

14

wealth alone.

15

reflected the views of members or shareholders this

16

Court pointed out were inapplicable to unions.

And whether or not the spending

So the premise I think doesn't necessarily

17
18

apply.

19

course, goes well beyond even the express advocacy

20

expenditures at issue in Austin.

21

different.

22

whether or not it should be regulated, is certainly

23

unambiguous in two senses.

24
25

And the speech we're talking about here, of

Express advocacy is

Express advocacy, whatever the value of

One, there is a specific request for

And two, it is virtually certain

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

141

1

that the listener is going to take that into account

2

as to whether or not to make a voting decision.

3

can't say that, I think, about any other kind of

4

speech, including speech that makes reference to

candidates.

ability to seek contributions just from anybody.

Why should that be?

MR. GOLD:

Well, I think that's one way to

13

look at it, but I think what this Court has pointed

14

out in a number of cases, and Belotti is a

15

particularly -- a pertinent case for this, is that

16

it's not so much the speaker.

17

not so much from the source, whether it's a union or

18

corporation or some other group.

19

The value of speech is

The value of speech is the informational

20

value that it gets to the public at large, the

21

enabling that that speech does for people to

22

participate in civic life.

23

from a corporate source or for a union source does

24

not devalue that speech.

25

And the fact that it's

So it's not so much that the speaker has a

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

144

1

First Amendment right as such, but the value of that

2

speech to the populus as a whole -QUESTION:

3

Then you are saying, I think,

4

that there is a kind of First Amendment volume

5

requirement that goes well beyond what in the

6

contribution context we referred to as reducing the

7

speech to something that doesn't amount to anything

8

at all.
You're saying that when we're talking

9
10

about direct expenditures, when an organization is

11

speaking that way, that there really is a kind of

12

volume criterion, that has nothing to do with

13

membership.
MR. GOLD:

14
15

criterion in the sense -- volume -QUESTION:

16
17

In this case, there is a volume

Volume, are you saying?

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

145

1

part of the intention of this.
QUESTION:

2

So the interest you're

3

vindicating here is all the television viewers during

4

election periods seeing all these 30 minute spots

5

over and over and over again , that's the interest.

6

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, that's --

7

QUESTION:

That is part of the interest.

8

MR. GOLD:

It certainly is part of the

9

interest.

I mean, there is a tremendous interest in

10

people and groups and organizations being able to address

11

public issues.

12

Court has identified and which the record supports,

13

including one of the -- at least one of the

14

Defendant's experts, Mr. Magleby, is that that's a

15

time when people are especially attentive to public

16

issues.

And the election period, which this

17

And the fact that some of this speech may

18

seem to have a, quote, effect on the election, which

19

is after all the standard that the Defendants now

20

justify this for, the fact that there might be some

21

effect can't possibly be a reason in order to stifle

22

it.

23

If we start down that road -QUESTION:

Then why is that not true with

24

a political party?

Why wouldn't you say the same

25

thing with a candidate?

And why is it, if we can

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

146

1

limit the expenditure, the contributions made to the

2

candidate for this kind of thing or the party, why

3

couldn't we do it to organizations that have less to

4

do with political life, for corporations?

5

MR. GOLD:

I think Title I has both

6

contribution and expenditure aspects.

7

is talking about limiting the independent speech.

8

That's the premise of section 203 is that this is --

9

QUESTION:

But here one

No, I think the premise is pay

10

for it out of your PAC.

11

rather pay for it out of certain limited

12

contributions.

13

that's harder to do.

14

for a party.

15

Not to limit the speech but

And I understand your argument that

MR. GOLD:

It's also maybe harder to do

It's not just harder to do, but

16

it really does, I think, distort the message.

17

inherently is distorting a message that is

18

nonelectoral if you have to do out of a PAC.

19

have to tell people you're soliciting for this fund.

20

It's not enough I think to label it something.

21

It

If you

The law has imposed a structure on these

22

committees.

They are political committees.

They

23

register with the Federal Election Commission.

24

Members of these organizations are used to the fact

25

that they are designed and used for making

Washington, D.C. 20005

147

1

contributions.
QUESTION:

2

The reason -- my question was

3

the reason that the union or the corporation has a

4

greater right here than the political party itself or

5

the candidate is?
MR. GOLD:

6

It's that it is -- it's not at

7

all connected with the concerns of corruption or

8

appearance of corruption that have animated and

9

underlie this Court's jurisprudence when it comes to

10

contributions.

This is independent private speech.

11

And from Buckley on and New York Times versus

12

Sullivan, this Court has recognized the value of

13

speech, even about elections by these groups.

14

is no rationale for muting their ability to speak on

15

public matters and speak on electoral matters.
QUESTION:

16

There

One of the themes of Buckley

17

was it's not up to the government to decide there is

18

too much speech coming from one place and not enough

19

coming from another.

20

MR. GOLD:

Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief

21

Justice.

And I think one of the -- something that

22

seems to animate this is the thought that certain

23

voices do have to be muted.

24

principle in Buckley, the fact that speech --

25

inevitably speech on candidates, speech on issues,

And I think the

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

148

1

that it's inevitably mixed in, inextricably linked,

2

is really at issue in this case.

3

Because what this statute says is when

4

that's the case, you silence it, you make it criminal

5

or you force people to raise money separately under a

6

separate rubric and call it electionary

7

communications, and call it --

QUESTION:

If you're right, the prior law

goes down the drain, too, doesn't it?
MR. GOLD:

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't

think that follows.

It's certainly muting, it's

been regulating for 60 years, longer than that in

corporations cases.

all over again.
MR. GOLD:

I think that's a fair question

that the Court does not have to reach in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, I think we have to reach

it if we're going to accept your premise.
MR. GOLD:

This case, in our view, turns

149

1

on the overbreadth, regardless of whether express

advocacy is regulable.

overbreadth.

One could assume that express

This provision, we believe,

When you say overbreadth, you

say because it goes beyond express advocacy.

that all you mean.
MR. GOLD:

13

It's because -- leaving express

advocacy aside -QUESTION:

12

Isn't

mean?

No, but isn't that what you

Isn't that your principal overbreadth point?
MR. GOLD:

Yes, in the sense that it

14

goes -- express advocacy by definition is not an

15

electionary communication.

16

It's everything else.

17

because some of the speech might influence -- might

18

affect an election, or influence an election, but

19

that it's criminalizing references to candidates --

The statute says that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW

23

ON BEHALF OF MINOR PLAINTIFFS

24
25

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

150

1

The court below unanimously concluded that

2

section 318, the prohibition of contributions by

3

minors is unconstitutional.

4

three constitutional defects.

5

a ban, not simply a limitation.

6

associational speech rights are recognized under 318.

The statute suffers from
First, section 318 is
No symbolic or

Second, the government failed to produce

7
8

sufficient evidence to show that there was corruption

9

or the appearance of corruption with regard to

10

conduit giving by minors.

The fact of the matter is,

11

Judge Henderson called the evidence remarkably thin.

12

Judge Kollar-Kotelly called the evidence so minimal

13

as to, in her words, doom the statute.
Section 318 is not closely drawn in

14
15

support of the interests being asserted.

16

the government concedes that this statute is an

17

absolute ban and they also concede that, in fact, the

18

ban burdens more speech than a limitation.
QUESTION:

argument.

At a minimum, there would have to be --

11

they would have to establish that the ban was

concern.

obviously it is more of a problem.

In a sense, the problem

diminishes with the age.

There aren't a great number

4

MR. SEKULOW: That's right.

5

QUESTION: -- year olds making contributions.
MR. SEKULOW:

6

That's exactly correct, Mr.

7

Chief Justice.

And the fact is, as Judge Leon

8

recognized, the younger the child gets, the less

9

likely are they to have resources.

But here again,

10

as the government concedes, this is an absolute ban

11

for 17 and under.

12

year-olds or four-year-olds or eight-year-olds.
QUESTION:

13
14

I'd still appreciate an answer.

Six month old, right?
MR. SEKULOW:

It is not worrying about just two­

old.
QUESTION:

17

Wonderful.

Now, once you give

18

me the six month old -- once you give me the six

19

month old, you've agreed that at some age, it's

20

reasonable to draw a line.

21

road, you have to deal with the obvious question that

22

the Constitution draws a line at 18 years old to

23

vote.

24
25

And once you're down that

And after all, it was thought you needed a
constitutional amendment to get that result.

And so

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

153

1

what's wrong with Congress saying, well, we think the

2

problem's about the same when you give money to a

3

candidate as when you vote for a candidate.

4

we're going to pick the same line.

5

year olds who would be excellent voters and there are

6

many older people who are terrible, okay?

7

pick this line for that, we would like this line for

8

this.

9

And so

There are many 17

So they

And what's wrong with that?
MR. SEKULOW:

Justice Breyer, two things

10

are wrong with that proposition.

First, the First

11

Amendment rights of speech and association are not

12

somehow contingent upon, dependent upon exercise of

13

the right to vote under the 26th.

14

Secondly -- and a perfect example of that

15

would be prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment,

16

women were denied the right to vote in the

17

United States but they certainly could still exercise

18

the rights of speech and association to obtain the

19

right of suffrage.

20

the same argument.

And I think it would be exactly

21

Also, in fact, in 11 states, 17 year olds

22

actually can vote in primaries so long as they reach

23

the age of 18 by the next general election.

24

are states in which in fact it can be that the 17

25

year old can vote.

So there

But that I think also proves up

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

154

1

the problem here.

And that is, if the government's

2

justification for the prohibition -- and here this

3

absolute prohibition -- is in fact that there is a

4

concern over conduit giving, the existing regulations

5

and existing law, 441(a) and (f), prohibit excess or

6

contributions given in the name of another, a conduit

7

gift.

8

That is absolutely prohibited.

9

Contributions given in the name of another within the

10

same provision, prohibited.

11

prohibits gifts in excess of the contribution limits.

12

This statute doesn't say that a 17 year old who is --

13

actually under this statute, a 17 year old who has

14

her own means of support, who might even be

15

emancipated, whose parents may have never given $1 to

16

a campaign are put in the situation where their gift

17

is banned.

18

illegal under the statute.

19

And of course, 441(a)

It's unauthorized and inappropriate,

QUESTION:

Mr. Sekulow, you said in your

20

brief that you would accept even a severe limitation,

21

but not an absolute ban, so among severe limitations,

22

would it be constitutional to say, yes, 16, 17 year

23

olds can give, but what they give is going to count

24

against how much the parent or parents who claim the

25

child as a dependent can give.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

155

1

MR. SEKULOW:

Actually, our -- our

2

discussion about that restrictions relates to what

3

some of the other states have done by allowing gift.

4

If no states bans gifts by minors, some stays do impose

5

what's called family contribution caps or

6

limitations.

7

closely drawn than an absolute prohibition.
QUESTION:

8
9

Again, certainly that would be more

I just wanted to know what you

meant in your brief by you would accept a limitation,

even a severe one.

11

accept?

Is this one that you would

MR. SEKULOW:

12

Well, we would accept this

13

fact.

14

evidence that in fact somehow a restriction on the

15

incremental amount allowed to be given would meet the

16

criteria of avoiding corruption or the appearance of

17

corruption, if the Government established that, sure,

18

but they haven't.

19

If the Government could establish through

I was using that as an --

QUESTION:

I'm not asking you about

20

establishing proof in one by one in an individual

21

case, because that wouldn't be worth anybody's time.

22

Could the law say it will count against the parent or

23

parents who take the child as a deduction?

24
25

MR. SEKULOW:

That would, I think it would

certainly make it more difficult, Justice Ginsburg,

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

156

1

to make a facial challenge if the gift, the symbolic

2

gift and the associational rights were recognized by

3

a cap.

4

that individual 17-year-old, 16-year-old, 15-year-old

5

to make that gift.

6

that, those examples of what some of the states have

7

done to allow gifts to made by minors but at the same

8

time putting what's called family caps in place.

9

would certainly make it more difficult as a facial

10

challenge, but again, this is a prohibition event.

But again, this is a ban.

11

It doesn't allow

We were trying to show through

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Sekulow, is it necessary to

12

rely on the First Amendment to reach your conclusion,

13

or could you argue this an unreasonable restraint on

14

liberty?

15

MR. SEKULOW:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, I would argue both.

You do argue both?
I would.

And I certainly

18

would assert again that what the individuals planned

19

on giving here is a liberty interest, but it's a --

20

it's also speech, it's also association.

21

underpinning of this Court's justifications for

22

limitations is the fact that an act of some type can

23

be given, a gift could be given.

24

complete, again, a complete prohibition.

a contemporary chapter in the century-long history of

regulation of corporate political giving.
QUESTION:

But it makes a big change.

It's one thing to say the corporation is

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

161

1

piece of legislation, which that segment of the

2

economy thinks is a very stupid piece of legislation,

3

and it will entirely wash out nuclear energy or

4

whatever it is, to say that the American people who

5

have organized themselves economically through

6

corporations cannot through the same mode defend that

7

segment of the economy against irrational legislative

8

action is to very much weaken, it seems to me, the

9

power of the people to, to have a real say in the

10

acts of the Government.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, as you say, Congress

12

has long been able to address express advocacy, and

13

what the evidence, the overwhelming evidence before

14

the district court showed is that in a modern

15

political campaign, the express advocacy test no

16

longer works.

17

inexact proxy for the kind of speech that affects

18

candidate elections that this Court has said

19

corporations must make through segregated, separate

20

segregated fund.

21

It no longer is -- it is a woefully

This Court has --

QUESTION:

Any issue, any issue advocacy

22

affects elections.

That's the purpose of it

23

ultimately, to get the people to agree with whoever

24

is making the issue ad about the issue and to elect

25

candidates who will come out that way.

So it seems

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

162

1

to me a very artificial distinction you're making.

2

You're --

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

QUESTION:

5

First of all, I don't --

You're essentially saying you

cannot have issue ads.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, I don't

7

think it's artificial distinction.

8

it's not a distinction I'm drawing.

9

distinction that this Court drew in Austin when it

In any event,
It's a

10

distinguished the situation it had before it in

11

Belotti, where it said that a corporation facing an

12

absolute ban, not a separate segregated fund

13

requirement but an absolute ban in participating in a

14

referendum, this Court held that unconstitutional.

15

In Austin, this Court said that limits on express

16

advocacy in the context of a candidate campaign

17

triggered different interests, and in that context,

18

Congress has a legitimate ability to deal with the

19

corrosive and distorting effects of aggregate

20

corporate wealth and the problems with diverting

21

shareholder and member money to political causes with

22

which they disagree.

23

QUESTION:

I think one of the -- one of

24

the dubious things about Austin is one of the things

25

it relied on was the fact that the corporation's

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

163

1

members or did not -- or owners did not necessarily

2

represent a large amount of public opinion, and it

3

seemed to me, I voted in the majority, but it seemed

4

to me since then that that's the whole purpose of the

5

First Amendment is to allow people who perhaps don't

6

have much in the way of public opinion try to change

7

public opinion.

8

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there are certainly

9

ways to do that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what

10

Austin represents incorrectly is the idea that when

11

corporate money is being aggregate for different

12

reasons, that there is an interest on the part of the

13

shareholders not to have that money diverted to

14

political causes with which they disagree.

15

outside of the corporate context, the principle that

16

you are advocating certainly applies.

17

are able to advocate unpopular causes with their

18

money and that is not a concern of Title II, but in

19

the corporate context this Court has drawn a

20

distinction, and that's not a distinction this Court

21

just drew in the Austin decision.

22

through this Court's decisions.

23

starts really from the Tillman Act in 1907 which

24

recognized that corporations are different.

25

Corporations posed unique risks of corruption, so in

Now,

Individuals

It's one that goes

It goes, and it

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

164

1

1907, corporations and corporations alone were barred

2

from making contributions to candidates.
Then in 1947, that ban was extended to

3
4

expenditures, and in Austin, this Court quite

5

correctly held up that as constitutional because of

6

the unique risks of the corporate context and what

7

the evidence before the district court showed is all

8

of those same interests that applied in Austin to

9

express advocacy equally apply to these kind of

10

electioneering communications.
QUESTION:

11

And doesn't -- doesn't the

12

primary definition today, in effect, give a

13

corporation or a union that wants to run an issue ad

14

a safe harbor simply by virtue of not mentioning the

15

name?

16

let anybody else tell you otherwise.

17

isn't it?

18

Say, let's hear it for nuclear power and don't

MR. CLEMENT:

That's safe,

That's exactly right.

That

19

is safe, Justice Souter, and that's why all of the

20

evidence before the district court that looks at

21

retrospective ads running previous cycles has to be

22

read in the light that one of the virtues of the

23

clarity with which Title II defines electioneering

24

communications is that a corporation can avoid the

25

trigger and that similar to current law, under

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

165

1

current law as we pointed out in our brief, the NRA

2

put together two ads in the 2000 election cycle.

3

They were virtually identical, except one of them

4

finished with the tag line, vote for Bush.

5

NRA --

6

QUESTION:

Now, the

How, how, how do you -- how do

7

you protect it if what you're talking about is the

8

McCain-Feingold bill or the Roth IRA or something

9

like that, where the, where there is a candidate's

10
11

name attached to specific legislation?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, let's, Justice

12

O'Connor, let's take the McCain-Feingold provision,

13

for example.

14

course, is to refer to it the way I have, as the

15

Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.

16

remember, however, that the restrictions in this bill

17

don't restrict any corporation from talking about the

18

McCain-Feingold bill in 48 states or in fact all 50,

19

as long as Senators McCain and Senator Feingold are

20

not up for election.

21

Now, first of all, one option, of

It's important to

Now, at the point that somebody wants to

22

make a reference to the McCain-Feingold, to one of

23

those Senators' voters in the immediate days running

24

up to the election then they may not be referring to

25

it in a way that has nothing to do with the election.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

166

1

They may be referring to it as that no good

2

McCain-Feingold legislation, and it may clearly have

3

an electioneering purpose.

4

QUESTION:

Now the Government has relied

5

very heavily this morning on the findings made by the

6

Congress and by the district court.

7

afternoon you are confronted with the fact that the

8

district court has said basically that the

9

distinction between express advocacy and issue ad is

And this

10

essentially meaningless and everybody knows it, so

11

why should we base our decision on that distinction,

12

when the district court has found, and I think

13

there's very little evidence to the contrary that

14

it's simply ephemeral?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, we

16

start from the same proposition, which that

17

distinction no longer holds up as a practical matter

18

of political reality.

19

conclusion from that that we should just end this

20

whole enterprise, but we take from that the

21

conclusion that Congress is not disabled from

22

addressing the serious problems that this Court found

23

that it could address in Austin.

24

QUESTION:

25

Now, I fear you may take the

Oh, so that you could come back

next year and say that the Congress, the pure issue

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

167

1

ads must also be prohibited?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

QUESTION:

4

I don't think so, Justice --

I mean, that must, that's the

necessary consequence of what you just said.
MR. CLEMENT:

5

No, it's not, Justice

6

Kennedy.

Just because the campaign finance laws need

7

to be adjusted from time to time doesn't mean there

8

are no limits and if you are looking for a limit in

9

keeping the distinction between this Court's decision

10

and Belotti and this Court's decision in Austin, one

11

clear limit is a reference to a candidate, because

12

that is one thing that clearly identifies an ad as

13

being tied to the interests of the candidate election

14

cycle.
QUESTION:

15

You want one of us to write an

16

opinion for the Court sustaining the statute on a

17

ground which everyone knows is ephemeral and

18

meaningless?
MR. CLEMENT:

19

Certainly not, Justice

20

Kennedy.

What we want to have this Court do is write

21

an opinion that upholds a limitation on corporate and

22

union spending from direct treasury funds that

23

reflects the current reality.

24

whether the decision that you would, that such a

25

decision upholding this legislation would still work

I can't tell you

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

168

1

25 years from now, but I can tell you that it will

2

work in the near term.

3

And this Court has said, for example, in

4

footnote 11 in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that

5

particularly in the First Amendment area, Congress

6

doesn't have to anticipate every problem.

7

respond to the observed realities and the observed

8

problems before it and try to address those and

9

that's what Congress did with this provision.

10

It can

As you say, the express advocacy test no

11

longer works.

12

absolutely no regulatory incentive to avoid express

13

advocacy, still themselves don't make reference,

14

don't make their pleas in those express terms.

15

The candidates themselves, who have

QUESTION:

The observed reality, if

16

history teaches us anything, is that when you plug

17

one means of expression, the money will go to

18

whatever means of expression are left and that will

19

continue to be the observed reality and that means we

20

will continue to have new pieces of legislation that

21

close more and more methods of reaching the public.

22

This does not fill me with confidence and joy.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

With all respect, Justice

24

Scalia, that's a formula for surrender in response to

25

what is clearly a problem that Congress has been

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

169

1

wrestling with for the most part successfully for a

2

hundred years, which is the corrosive and distorting

3

effects of corporate wealth on candidate elections.
QUESTION:

4

I agree with you.

You want us

5

to say just what Justice Kennedy said, that the

6

distinction is ephemeral, right?

7

the distinction is ephemeral.

8

express, you can ban the issue ad which mentions the

9

name.

10
11

Now, we've heard

And if you can ban the

And now there were two, I thought, safe

harbors.
Safe harbor number 1 is what Justice

12

Souter said, don't mention the name of the candidate

13

60 days before election.

14

I had been discussing before, which I wanted your

15

response to, was the PAC.

16

too tough, say, for Philip Morris or Ciba Geigy, if

17

they really want to mention the candidate's name, to

18

set up a PAC.

19

Safe harbor number 2, which

Now, I thought it wasn't

Now, I've heard that that's not so, that I

20

was wrong about that.

And the reason that I was

21

wrong, I've just been told, as you heard too, is

22

because it's going to be hard for these big

23

corporations and the labor unions to raise the money

24

through the PAC to run the very ad with the name of

25

the candidate in the last 60 days.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

170

1

I would like your view about that.

Do you

2

think that's right and not just subjectively, is

3

there any evidence about it?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

answer is you were right all along.
QUESTION:

separate segregated fund requirement.

13

the requirement was made in Austin as well that, oh,

argument there and Justice Brennan in his concurrence

17

addressed it and made two very good points.

18

This is, after all, not the

And of course

The Court rejected that

First, in footnote 7, he said that that

19

just doesn't reflect the observed reality, that the

20

Michigan Chamber of Commerce there was very

21

successful in raising funds for its PAC.

22

time, success was measured $140,000.

23

because what this record says is that the NRA in the

24

Political Victory Fund was able to raise $17 million

25

just for its PAC.

At that

It seems quaint

171

QUESTION:

Brennan's opinion in that case?
MR. CLEMENT:

No, that was a concurrence

that reflected the views of the majority.
QUESTION:

5
6

Did anyone else join Justice

Did other people join his

opinion?
MR. CLEMENT:

7

No, they didn't, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, but I think that it is certainly -- I'm not

9

suggesting that it binds this Court in any way.

10

just suggesting that Justice Brennan's logic in

11

addressing that problem has persuasive force.

12

true also that the majority opinion of Justice

13

Marshall in that case, also noted, described the

14

Michigan Chamber of Commerce in that case as being

15

quite successful in its PAC.

16

said in the majority opinion that they were success

as -- to the tune of $140,000.

18

amplified that point in his concurrence.
QUESTION:

That Justice Brennan

Well, is there a way of writing

20

an opinion that would say, if a particular

21

organization otherwise covered does have some unusual

22

problem with a PAC, either because it doesn't want to

23

say it's political or because it can't raise the

24

money, that's a matter for an as-applied challenge

25

later?

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

172

1

MR. CLEMENT:

The Court could certainly

2

say that, Justice Breyer, and I think should say

3

that.

4

the separate segregated fund requirement here, if I

5

understand it, is that the gravamen of the concern

6

seems to be that the solicitation restrictions on the

7

separate segregated fund make it difficult to raise

8

enough money.

9

The remarkable thing about the challenge to

Now, the reason I find that so surprising

10

is there was a direct challenge to those solicitation

11

requirements before this Court in the National Right

12

to Work Committee case.

13

rejected that challenge.

And this Court unanimously

14

So the solicitation requirements and the

15

separate segregated fund, which by the way were not

16

changed by BCRA and therefore really probably aren't

17

even jurisdictionally before this Court, those -- if

18

somebody has a problem with the solicitation

19

requirements either on their face or as applied,

20

that's open to them in an as-applied challenge.

21

QUESTION:

It depends on whether -- the

22

fact that we said that it's okay in another context

23

doesn't mean that it's okay in this context.

24

depends on what the consequence of not being able to

25

do it except through a PAC happens to be.

It

And here

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

173

1

the consequence is very severe indeed.
MR. CLEMENT:

2

Well, Justice Scalia, the

3

consequence is entirely speculative on this record.

4

As I say, some groups even under the current system

5

have been able to assemble massive amounts of money

6

in their political action committees.

7

remarkable if for no other reason that as Justice

8

Kennedy pointed out, it's sort of no reason to do it

9

under the current system, because one of the main

10

reasons to put money in your political action fund

11

was so that you could engage in express advocacy

12

rather than issue advocacy.
QUESTION:

13

And that is

It seems to me the burden ought

14

to be on you to demonstrate that it won't hurt them,

15

not on them to demonstrate that it will.

16

preventing them from using their money for speech.

17

You're saying this -- your normal money can't be used

18

for it.

You have to get money from some other

19

source.

And you want them to have to demonstrate

20

that this will harm them.
MR. CLEMENT:

21

You are

Justice Scalia, with

22

respect, this issue is no different than the parallel

23

issue in the context of Austin.

24

too.

25

the Justices pointed out, there is not one word in

That was speech,

That was a burden of speech.

And as some of

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

174

1

Buckley or in Austin that suggests that express

2

advocacy is somehow second class speech.

3

Indeed, there is no higher protected

4

speech than vote for Bush or vote for Gore, yet

5

nonetheless, the restrictions there were upheld by

6

the Court and there were not --

QUESTION:

8

Five to four and don't blame it

on me.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Very well, Justice Scalia,

11

but I'll take the five to four.

12

arguments that are being raised in opposition to this

13

statute are the arguments of the dissenters in

14

Austin, not the arguments of the majority opinion in

15

Austin.

16

And many of the

And I think that's an important point.
This Court has approved the same basic

17

mechanism in the context of express advocacy.

18

worked well perhaps not with the definition of

19

express advocacy, but has worked well in terms of the

20

separate segregated fund requirement.

21

It has

The other point I think that has to be

22

made about the separate segregated fund requirement

23

is that the idea that, okay, let's say that we now

24

have meaningful limits so there are going to be some

25

real incentives to put some money in your political

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

175

1

action committee or your separate segregated fund.

2

One of two things can happen.

3

With some organizations, it may very well

4

turn out that some of the people who were members of

5

the overall organization, turns out they really

6

weren't 100 percent interested in supporting the

7

political causes of that organization.

8

like some of the other benefits of membership.

9

in that case, the amount of money that would be

10
11

They sort of
And

raised will be reduced.
In some other organizations, it may be

12

that every member of the organization supports the

13

political cause and they give the money to the

14

separate segregated fund.

15

purposes of the separate segregated fund are fully

16

vindicated because the resulting corporate political

17

activity at that point will reflect the views of the

18

underlying membership and the underlying union

19

members, which is precisely what this Court said was

20

a compelling interest in Austin.

21

QUESTION:

In either event, the

otherwise, that is not directed towards the fostering

of its business?

Wouldn't they be leaving themselves

MR. CLEMENT:

There is certainly a large

2

body of state law about corporate waste that is, if I

3

remember it from law school, fairly impenetrable and

4

doesn't provide a lot of specific guidance in

5

particular consequences, in particular cases.

6

But I would say that that same issue again

7

was raised in Austin, and this Court said that it was

8

not sufficient simply to leave everything to the

9

state law of waste, where you have the business

10

judgment rule, and everything's set up to make sure

11

that no corporation is ever held liable.
This Court said that in this particular

12
13

context, it was much more appropriate to use the

14

separate segregated fund requirement which has been

15

part of the law and functionally since 1947 -QUESTION:

16

I am raising the question to

17

respond to your point that shareholders don't agree

18

with every jot and tittle of what the corporation

19

does.

20

often some of the things that corporations should

21

divest itself of a certain business, others think

22

they shouldn't.

23

-- this is part of belonging to an organization --

24

the responsibility to determine what is in the

25

interest of that corporation.

They don't in the economic field either.

Very

They have ceded to the organization

Washington, D.C. 20005

177

And it seems to me that is no less true

with respect to political, especially issue ads as to

3

what issues are important for that corporation's

4

survival.

5

on unanimity among the shareholders when it comes to

6

that very important issue.

I don't know why all of a sudden we insist

MR. CLEMENT:

7

Well, I think again, Justice

8

Scalia, the resort I would take is to the Austin

9

decision, which rejected that argument as well.

And

10

it did so on the basis that candidate elections are

11

different than other situations.

12

an affront for a shareholder to have their money

13

spent on an issue that they don't particularly care

14

for, or to have the corporation go into some new line

15

of business that the shareholder thinks, boy, that's

16

really not very smart, you should stick with what you

17

know best.

It may be a bit of

That's an affront.
But it's a much greater affront to have

18
19

that individual's money spent on candidate elections

20

where that individual does not agree with the

21

position that the corporation has taken.

22

And let me just add --

23

QUESTION:

You said any mention of the

24

candidate makes it a candidate ad and not an issue

25

ad.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

178

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I thought that's the

2

position you were taking earlier, because I think

3

there is a sense in which any time -- if you're

4

talking about ads within 60 days from election that

5

are targeted to a candidate's home district then I

6

think -- and mention that candidate, I think it's a

7

safe assumption to be made that they at least have a

8

mixed motive.

9

And one of the motives is to influence the

10

candidate election.

11

consciously decides to link its issue up to a

12

candidate election, then it's a perfectly appropriate

13

response to make that corporation funded through a

14

separate segregated fund.

15

QUESTION:

And I think if the corporate

Mr. Clement, I think just as a

16

matter of history, that the decision in the Belotti

17

against First National Bank of Boston invalidated the

18

statute that was really typical throughout the

19

United States at the time.

20

the olden times a policy against using corporate

21

funds for political purposes at all.

22

I think is consistent with the position here.

MR. CLEMENT:

Generally, there was in

So the history

That's right.

And this

24

Court took a different step over the Chief Justice,

25

among others' dissents and said no, we're going to

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW

179

1

invalidate that traditional approach.

But then in

2

Austin, this Court drew an important distinction

3

between the candidate election context and the issue

4

context.

5

I was talking a minute ago about the mixed

6

motives and I did want to be responsive to a question

7

that Justice Souter had asked earlier, which is this

8

question about in the specific studies that Congress

9

and the district court discussed, was mixed motive an

10
11

option for the people that were scoring the ads.
And as a matter of fact, it was not.

The

12

students were asked whether or not the issue in the

13

particular ad had a tendency to support or go against

14

a candidate, or if it addressed an issue.

15

no mixed motive box, and I think the net effect of

16

that is that whatever overbreadth is estimated by the

17

studies, it actually overstates the overbreadth

18

because it didn't account for the mixed motive case.

19

There was

And as I say, I think the mixed motive

20

case does reflect the reality in a number of

21

situations.

22

corporation makes that conscious decision to link

23

some controversial issue to a candidate election, at

24

that point, the interest that this Court found

25

sufficient in Austin are fully implicated.

But I do think that the point that a

180

1

QUESTION:

One of the briefs argues that

2

frequently these issues are before Congress almost at

3

the same time the election comes up, because the

4

Congress is catching up perhaps on things that it

5

didn't do earlier in the session.
And so it's not the corporation's

6
7

voluntary choice to put it up there.

8

it has to do it, if it's going to do any good.
MR. CLEMENT:

9

That's the time

Again, and the safe harbors

10

that we talked about earlier are still available in

11

that situation.

12

pointed out, twofold.

And they are, as Justice Breyer

One, if all the corporation is really

13
14

concerned about is a pending legislative issue, it

15

doesn't need to make a reference to the candidate and

16

it can run the issue through treasury funds.

17

other hand, if they want to make a specific reference

18

to the candidate, tie that legislative issue to the

19

broader context of the campaign, then they're free to

20

do so as long as they do so through their separate

21

segregated fund.
QUESTION:

22

On the

Mr. Clement, why do you make an

23

exception for these corporations, these aggregations

24

of vast wealth that happen to own television

25

stations?

General Electric, for example, which, if I

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

181

1

recollect correctly, owns NBC.

2

okay for them to have issue ads, name candidates,

3

oppose candidates?

4

exception for that.

They're not covered, there's an

MR. CLEMENT:

5

Why is it perfectly

Well, first of all, Justice

6

Scalia, as I understand the media exemption, it

7

applies to the media corporation but not necessarily

8

to the entire corporation, so I don't think --

9

QUESTION:

Well, just NBC, which is owned

10

by General Electric.

So everybody should go out and

11

get himself a television station, right?
MR. CLEMENT:

12

I don't know about that.

13

What I do know is that media corporations are

14

exempted for the same reason they've always been

15

exempted from the law, which is that they do pose a

16

different situation, a difference of kind.

17

Court -QUESTION:

18
19

Why is that?

I don't understand that.
MR. CLEMENT:

20
21

And why is that?

And this

I mean, I think the

traditional role of media companies has been quite

22
23

different than the traditional role of other

24

companies.

25

QUESTION:

What case do you have that we

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

182

1

can distinguish speech based on the identity of the

2

speaker?

Outside of this area?
MR. CLEMENT:

3

Well, I don't know.

I've

4

been focused on this area for the last couple of

5

weeks, Justice Kennedy, and the case that comes to

6

mind is Austin, where the Michigan statute before

7

this Court -QUESTION:

8
9

You really like Austin, don't

you?
MR. CLEMENT:

10

I love Austin.

It's binding

11

precedent.

I don't, I mean, as much as the

12

plaintiffs don't seem to like the case, I don't

13

really hear them asking this Court to overrule it.
QUESTION:

14

Well, but this, this is a

15

serious question.

A large part of -- of the

16

necessity, or at least the perceived necessity for

17

these ads is to counter the influence of the press.

18

This -- this is a very serious First Amendment issue.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I know it is, Justice --

20

QUESTION:

21

authority for this distinction.

22

QUESTION:

And you have -- and you have no

Well, isn't Buckley a point on

23
24

this?

Wasn't there an exception in the statute in

25

Buckley?

183

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

particular provision --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

It wasn't challenged, though.
Yes.

I don't think that

They didn't challenge it.

That's the reason.
MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

But it was brought

7

into full focus in the Austin case, and the argument

8

was made there, as it's made here, that the statute

9

is somehow underinclusive because it doesn't include

10

media corporations, and I -- it is a difficult issue,

11

I will admit, but I think this is an area where

12

sometimes it is just as much a problem to treat

13

different entities the same as it is to treat similar

14

entities differently.

15

QUESTION:

But you were -- you were going

16

to explain why this difference exists, and I don't

17

think you've done that yet.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the difference is

19

that because of the traditional role of what a media

20

corporation does, there is, there's an inherent

21

involvement in the political process.

22

recognized that, I think at least implicitly in Mills

23

against Alabama, when you had a situation where there

24

was an effort to apply a statute to a newspaper, and

25

I think because of the role of the media, there is a

This Court

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

184

1

recognition that a different rule should apply to the

2

media, and again, this is -- this is no revolution in

3

the, in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.

4

just carrying through -QUESTION:

5

This is

Well, what, what about say the

6

National Rifle Association?

It's against gun laws.

7

A media corporation is very much in favor of gun

8

laws, it prints editorials, perhaps it even slants,

9

God forbid, its coverage of the subject.

There is a

10

substantial difference, substantial similarity there,

11

isn't there?
MR. CLEMENT:

12

Well, there certainly is the

13

similarity in the sense that they're both addressing

14

the same issue, but I do think that again this Court

15

has drawn that distinction in the Austin case and

16

Congress has drawn that distinction throughout its

17

campaign finance reform.

18

provision.

19

QUESTION:

This is not some new

But what do you think should be

20

the underlying valid principle that allows that

21

distinction to be drawn?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

QUESTION:

I think the under --

Why is it that a group of

24

citizens concerned about what they consider to be

25

slanted press cannot get together, have a corporation

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

185

1

and take out issue ads on the other side of that

2

issue?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, absolutely they can, and

4

I think if what you're talking about is running an

5

issue about the slanted press, I can't imagine how

6

that has to refer to a candidate, so I think you come

7

within both safe harbors that are available to

8

corporations.

9

segregated fund, but again, if what a corporation

They could do it through a separate

10

wants to do is correct some nasty publication that's

11

been running some media corporation, they are

12

perfectly free to do that with treasury funds and

13

it's, it's harder for me to imagine how that would be

14

translated into the context of a candidate election.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, Austin aside, do

16

you know of any case of ours that says that the

17

press, quote, has greater First Amendment rights than

18

Joe Mimeograph Machine?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

I don't.

I know there are

cases that address --

21

QUESTION:

There are none.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

QUESTION:

Right.

There are none.

24

said just the opposite.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

In fact, we've

Well, this Court has talked

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

186

1

in various cases, Mills against Alabama is one, about

2

the freedom of the press, and suggesting maybe that

3

adds something, but I don't think there is a case

4

that draws that definitive distinction, but again,

5

this is a little bit different.

6

that the Freedom of the Press Clause, although that

7

has been raised in this litigation obliquely, that

8

the Freedom of Press Clause is what makes the

9

difference.

This is not saying

What makes the difference here is a

10

legitimate decision by Congress to treat these

11

different corporations differently, and again, I know

12

you don't want to hear me say it, but the Austin

13

Court heard the argument, it said that that argument

14

is invalid.

15

And I don't think --

QUESTION:

I think they want to know why.

16

And I suppose that what we are talking about is that

17

the Times or any radio station runs an editorial

18

saying, vote for Smith, or Jones is against labor,

19

for example, but if a union or corporation runs --

20

pays for the ad on the next page it falls right

21

within the ad.

22

with the traditional role of the newspaper where we

23

expect them to have reporters, some of whom will in

24

fact think one thing and some will think another and

25

the editorials may or may not make sense, but there

I thought that the reason had to do

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

187

1

are considerable implications for regulating those

2

that don't exist when we talk about Philip Morris or

3

the municipal workers union.
MR. CLEMENT:

4

No, I think that's exactly

5

right.

It reflects that historical tradition.

6

also reflects the reality that applying this kind of

7

limitation to the press would make it very difficult

8

for them to report anything.
QUESTION:

9

It

Well, wouldn't it go further

10

than that?

11

press should be subject to the same limitations and

12

presumably have the same powers, then the press would

13

have to publish a separate newspaper through a PAC in

14

order to make the otherwise limited expression during

15

the 30-day period.

18

I mean, that can't be done.

MR. CLEMENT:

16
17

I mean, if, if the argument that the

No.

That can't be done, and

in -QUESTION:

That wasn't the argument, that

19

the press has to be subject to these limitations.

20

The argument is, since these limitations would

21

obviously be bad as applied to the press, they are

22

bad as applied to everybody else, because everybody

23

else has the same rights as the press.

I don't know

24
25

why, why should it be that the corporation of great

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

188

1

wealth -- let me put the question this way.

2

could Congress pass a law saying, we are concerned

3

about the influence of major media corporations,

4

Mr. Murdoch?

5

corporation can own more than two national

6

newspapers.

We are going to pass a law that no

Would that law be valid?

MR. CLEMENT:

7

Could,

I'm sure that law would be

8

challenged.

There might be a defense that you could

9

try to make on the law, but the point I'd like to

10

make is that I think that this effort is just another

11

effort to say that Congress is powerless in this

12

field, because all the problems you are raising about

13

electioneering communication and how you treat the

14

press differently apply a fortiori I to express

15

advocacy.

16

QUESTION:

You mean, you mean, you think

17

I'm saying that Congress shall make no law

18

respecting, abridging the freedom of speech?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

I think --

That is what I'm saying.
I think what you are saying

22

is that contrary to this Court's decisions in Austin,

23

in MCFL, in all the corporate, in all the cases

24

dealing with contributions, that the First Amendment

25

holds the Congress powerless to deal with this

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

189

1

problem.

And that is what this Court's cases say.

2

QUESTION:

Haven't we held that --

3

QUESTION:

Do you find it unusual that the

4

Congress is powerless to favor one speaker over

5

another?

6

Is that such an astounding proposition?
MR. CLEMENT:

No.

What would be an

7

astounding proposition is in light of the 100-year

8

tradition of Congress' ability to regulate the

9

influence of corporate political activity and

10

corporate influence on political elections if all

11

they can do is limit express advocacy or as I

12

understand some members of this Court, they can't

13

even do that.

14

swallow because Congress has been active in this

15

field since 1907.

16

addressing today are not different in kind from the

17

abuses they have addressed for the past 100 years,

18

and I simply don't think that they are powerless to

19

deal with this situation.

20

That is a very difficult position to

The abuses that they are

QUESTION:

Haven't we held that licensees

21

can be, radio licensees and television can be

22

compelled to give equal time to opposing points of

23

view but you can't compel the newspapers to do that?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

That's a very good

point, and there are differences with respect to

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

190

1

broadcast media, and I think if I can digress for a

2

minute to talk about some of the other provisions

3

like Section 305, 311, and 504 --

4

QUESTION:

You say there are differences

5

with respect to the broadcast media.

6

relying on the scarcity of wavelengths, are you?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

You are not

Well, I think with respect

8

to some of the other provisions, 504, 307, I'm sorry,

9

305 and 311, I do think that this Court's cases

10

suggesting that broadcast media are subjected to a

11

different regulatory regime remain good law, and I

12

think that there is certainly enough in this case

13

without trying to revisit Red Lion or some of these

14

other cases.

15

happen in this case and one of the unfortunate by

16

products of the en masse nature of the way this case

17

is litigated is that you look at some of the

18

provisions that are dealing with a very different

19

type of speech, and then you get to Section 504 and

20

you take a look at the broad terms that Congress has

21

used and it's easy to reach the conclusion that

22

that's an impermissible approach and those words are

23

too broad, but that ignores the reality of the way

24

the broadcast industry has been regulated.

25

I think one of the things that can

That's, after all, an industry that

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

191

1

continues to be regulated on a public interest

2

standard.

statute that required individual stations to give

reasonable time to candidates and it's within that

background that a provision, the kind of provisions

that Congress added to Section 504 are not -QUESTION:

In CBS against FCC, this Court upheld a

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think in the CBS

10

case that the court specifically addressed the

11

scarcity rationale.

12

on prior precedents, though, that were based on that.

It may well have been building

One other point I'd --

about regulating the broadcast media.

20

That's the

They are the only people here who
It's people who are trying to get

It's not the media who are regulated.
MR. CLEMENT:

But that's the way that the

21

media has long been regulated, which is to say that

22

with respect to requests for candidate advertisement,

23

with requests to address a, quote, controversial

24

issue of public importance, which is the pre-existing

25

law, nothing added by BCRA, there has been a

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

192

1

requirement that if you make a request for air time,

2

that the station do some record-keeping in

3

conjunction with that and that's exactly what 504

4

carries over.
QUESTION:

5

Why -- why did they ask for

6

record of requests as opposed to actual broadcast

7

deals?
MR. CLEMENT:

8
9

I think one of the reasons,

Justice O'Connor, is so that they could enforce the

10

public interest standard, which has, which has

11

manifested itself not only in the fairness doctrine,

12

but also with the idea that stations have to give

13

appropriate amounts of time to things like discussion

14

of legislative issues.

15

requests before you, you can then make a judgment as

16

to whether or not one station is denying all the

17

requests.

18

QUESTION:

Must the disclosure be made

19

before the ads are run?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

And so if you have the

It's not clear.
Well, it depends on which

provision that you are asking about, Justice --

22

QUESTION:

I'm talking about 504.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

In 504, what triggers the

24

disclosure, the disclosure requirements is, is a

25

request and again --

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

193

1

QUESTION:

Yes, I know.

But I'm asking

2

about the time within which it has to be disclosed by

3

the broadcast stations.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not positive about this.

5

I don't think that Section 504 has that kind of

6

advance notice principle to it.

7

objections that have been raised have been raised to

8

Sections 201 and 214, and I think with respect to

9

those provisions, it's important and worthwhile to

10

note that the FC -- the FEC has cured the advance

11

notice issue by regulation, and what people seem to

12

have focused on is the idea that the statute requires

13

the disclosure of a contract to disburse, and that

14

language is not designed to get at advanced

15

disclosure in the sense of advanced disclosure before

16

the ad airs.

17

the clear circumvention that would happen if somebody

18

could buy ads on credit and then only disclose them

19

after the fact, after the election when they had

20

actually made the disbursement at that point.

21

think --

22

The advance notice

It's simply to get away with, to avoid

QUESTION:

I

But that, that same objective

23

could be obtained simply by requiring disclosure by

24

the station as soon as they, as soon as they run, I

25

mean, file a report on the day that the ad runs.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

194

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, I think that's

2

right, but again, that is the way that the FEC has

3

interpreted the provisions, which is to say there is

4

no advance disclosure requirement under 201 and 214

5

as interpreted by the FEC, because they trigger to

6

the definition of, for example, in 201 the

7

electioneering communication and you don't even know

8

for sure that it's an electioneering communication

9

until it's in fact it is run in the relevant district

10

that's been targeted and all the like, so in that

11

sense I do think that the FEC has cured any problem

12

with advance notice.

13

I'm not sure it was that much of a problem

14

in any event because what you are talking about is

15

forcing people to disclose the fact that they made

16

binding contracts.

17
18

I think it's also --

QUESTION:

What happens to the language,

or contracts to make?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Again --

The regulation just reads that

out of existence?
MR. CLEMENT:

No, again, what contracts to

23

makes disbursement, or I don't know what language you

24

have in front of you, but contracts to make

25

disbursement.

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

195

1

QUESTION:

It's in 202.

Any person, if

2

any person makes or contracts to make any

3

disbursement for an electioneering communication.
MR. CLEMENT:

4

Again, as I was explaining

5

to Justice O'Connor, that provision is necessary to

6

avoid the phenomenon where somebody contracts to make

7

a disbursement, i.e., buys an ad on credit and

8

doesn't make the disbursement until after the ad is

9

run or in fact after the election, so that's why

10

that's in there.

11

statute --

12

It's also worth noting that the

QUESTION:

But it goes on to say, such

13

disbursement or contracting shall be treated as a

14

contribution and as an expenditure.

15

disbursement or contracting, so I assume the

16

contracting immediately falls --

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Such

No, it doesn't fall within

18

the con -- the disclosure provision.

I suppose if

19

you buy $10,000 worth of ads on credit that does

20

become an expenditure the second you make that credit

21

purchase, but I don't think that renders a statute

22

unconstitutional.

23

this advance sort of contract to purchase language

24

has been in the statute all along.

25

with respect to expenditures.

I think again it bears noting that

It was in FECA

In fact, I believe

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

196

1

that Justice Souter made note of that in footnote

2

one.

3

QUESTION:

To challenged and upheld.

I

4

mean, there's so much that was in FECA, and there's

5

so much more that's in this that hasn't been

6

challenged here.

7

around for 30 years doesn't, doesn't convince me that

8

it's valid.

9

I mean, simply to say it's been

MR. CLEMENT:

It depends on the nature of

10

the challenge with respect, Justice Scalia.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-DEFENDANTS

Washington, D.C. 20005

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

3

Buckley v. Valeo taught not that the

4

so-called magic words test was a constitutional

5

immutable.

6

enduring, that are profound, and that demonstrate

7

just exactly why the electioneering communications

8

definition and provision is constitutional.

9

first thing that Buckley taught in this area is that

It taught two lessons that are much more

The

10

statutory requirements that cut right through core

11

political speech, nothing more core than vote for

12

Bush or Bush is a good guy the day before the

13

election.

14

Statutory requirements in this area must

15

be clear, they must be illusive so that they will

16

not, as this Court said, quote, dissolve impractical

17

application.

18

the other side has suggested that there is any lack

19

of clarity in this objective test.

20

the second factor that this Court articulated in --

21

No doubt about this case.

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

The second test,

I don't want --

because this is important.

suggested that what is less than clear?

candidate.

6

And so many we are talking about whether

7

or not this law is overbroad or substantially

8

overbroad, I suggest that the Court look to the

9

standard that it articulated itself in Buckley, which

MR. WAXMAN:

Didn't they strike

The district court struck

21

down the primary definition and upheld an altered

22

version of the backup definition, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

And it did so, based on its understanding and it was

24

a misunderstanding of what the data showed with

25

respect to the answer that was given to, I think it's

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

201

1

question 6 in the Buying Time study.

That is, our

2

data that showed that for one of the two years

3

involved, 14.7 percent of the ads, which constituted

4

a total of six ads, were issue-related, not

5

candidate-related.

6

QUESTION:

This is the binary choice.

7

QUESTION:

Didn't the district court

8
9

pretty well disbelieve the Buying Time study?
MR. WAXMAN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

In

10

fact, Judge Leon, who was the swing vote, so to

11

speak, specifically found that although there had

12

been some criticisms with respect to the methodology

13

with respect to this one question, he specifically

14

found that the Buying Time study was credible, and

15

that the results should be given credence.

16

And it was on the basis of his

17

interpretation of the answer to that one question

18

that he determined that, well, this is 14.7 percent

19

or 17 percent and that's overbroad.

20

like to address myself to is why -- first of all,

21

that analysis was incorrect.

22

even if there never had been a Buying Time study,

23

even if this question was never asked, Congress had

24

more than ample justification for doing this.

25

And what I would

But more to the point,

One of the wonderful things about a bright

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

202

1

line objective test is it invites hypotheticals.

2

what Congress had before it, which is in strict

3

scrutiny, after all, what we're addressing ourselves

4

to, was the real world.

5

is Defense Exhibit 48 in the record below -- the

6

story boards of all of the ads that were captured by

7

the CMAG database.

8

markets in the 11 months that led up to the 1998

9

campaign and the 2000 campaign.

10

But

And it had before it -- this

That is, in the 75 largest media

And we urge the Court to look through this

11

volume because the real world of what these ads were

12

does not reflect the hypothetical instances in which

13

a corporation or a labor union is faced with an

14

imminent piece of legislation that's going to be

15

enacted the week before or the week after an election

16

and it's only about changing votes.

17

There may very well be instances, if that

18

occurs, in which an as-applied challenge can be made

19

and a court can determine whether or not the law can

20

constitutionally be applied to that.

21

amazing feature about this case is the remarkable

22

degree to which the four-part objective test that

23

Congress drew actually hits the observed reality of

24

what Congress knew these ads were about.

25

But what is an

5

was 2000.

And what the chart shows is a graph that

Yes.

This

Weeks prior to the 2000 election.

If you look at the dotted line which sort

6
7

of waves back and forth very close to the bottom

8

axis, those are the number of ads, issue ads, run

9

during 2000 that don't mention candidates.

10

It stays

very constant throughout the year.
If you look at the hard line, you'll see

11
12

an enormous spike that comes right about week 9, nine

13

weeks before.

14

And what Congress found was that there was

15

substantial evidence, both the ads themselves and

16

through objective data that I'm now going to

17

describe, that what common sense leads you to

18

believe, that is, that ads that run just before an

19

election, that mention a candidate that are targeted

20

at that candidate's election, and that use broadcast

21

media, that is the most expensive kind of media

22

possible, are very likely intended to have, and

23

overwhelmingly likely will have, an effect on an

24

election.

25

That's 63 days before the election.

Now, Justice Scalia, you're quite right.

We're talking about a test here that --

6

we're talking the test is spending that is

unambiguously related to a campaign.

Congress found, based on the ads, is that that was

the case.

And what

10

of these direct ads, just look at the ones that the

Plaintiffs have attached to their brief.

QUESTION:

The Congress found that these

ads made them feel very bad, and we would not accept

14

that they criticized the incumbents.

15

accept that rationale from a city council.

16

should we do it from the Congress?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

We wouldn't

Absolutely not.

Why

And that is

18

not the reason that -- there is a lot of talk about

attack ads.

20

attack ads and they didn't even ban attack ads by

21

corporations and labor unions and nonprofits.

22

But the reality is they didn't ban

QUESTION:

But you're saying that was not

23

any part of the rationale for the enactment of a

legislation?

That's correct.

There were

individual statements by members of Congress who were

upset about this.

Congress crafted, and the fact -- and it is in the

4

record in this case that the vast majority of these

5

ads were attacking not incumbents.

6

of these ads were attacking challengers.

think it's fair -QUESTION:

But if you look at the test that

banned attack ads?

It's very hard to devise a good

10

punchy attack ad that doesn't name the person you're

11

attacking.
MR. WAXMAN:

12

There is no doubt about the

13

fact that these ads -- there are ads here that both

14

attack and praise.

15

QUESTION:

Well --

16

MR. WAXMAN:

My point to Justice Kennedy

17

was, by and large, the incumbents made out very well

under the status quo ante.

19

Scalia --

20

QUESTION:

And it is -- Justice

If the price of getting rid of

21

the attack ads is that I have to ban some of the

22

praising ads as well, it's worth it.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

The purpose of the

24

legislation, and it is manifest, we included it in an

25

appendix in our brief, and it's in the Thompson

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

206

1

committee report and the page is cited by Senator

2

3

a loophole.

It was closing a loophole that the

was a wall built of the same sturdy material as the

8

emperor's clothing.

9

believes it.

Everyone sees it.

No one

It was, in other words, serving the

10

paramount interest in reducing a provision of law, a

11

provision of law enacted by Congress following this

12

Court's decision in Buckley that had made the law an

13

object of scorn.
And that is all over the record in this

14
15

case.

That what this was about was replacing a line

16

in the sand drawn on a windy day with a line that

17

everybody can see and that no one would miss.

18

the evidence before Congress was not just this

19

question 6, but the ads themselves, the way they ran.

20

There are statement after statement after statement

21

from witnesses in this case that are included in the

22

Joint Appendix.

It was in fact funded almost exclusively

by Pharma and the corporations that make up Pharma.

18

Nothing wrong with them running issue ads at all,

19

Justice Scalia.

20

that is, until the 60-day period cut in, they ran

21

23,867 issue ads about Medicare and not a single one

22

mentioned a candidate.

Well, again, Justice

-QUESTION:

You've raised the risk of

corruption or the appearance of corruption, the fact

11

that they -- I mean, I agree with you that they named

12

candidates.

13

who it is, that's a different issue.

14

you disclose who's doing it, what is wrong with their

15

naming a candidate?

16

What is wrong, so long as you disclose

MR. WAXMAN:

But so long as

Well, I -- Justice Scalia,

17

I'm right here with my brother, Clement, with Austin.

18

And with the very same rationale that this Court

19

adopted in Austin, which was explicated in the Auto

20

Workers case by Justice Frankfurter, which was

21

recited again by a unanimous opinion of the Court in

22

National Right to Work Committee.

23

The issue here is whether or not, when

24

we're talking about campaign-related speech, when we

25

are talking about who gets to speak when individual

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20005

209

1

citizens are exercising their constitutional

2

franchise to vote, the question is whether

3

corporations and labor unions have to do it the same

4

way all the rest of us do.

5

QUESTION:

What about the --

6

MR. WAXMAN:

With voluntary funds

7

contributed by individuals for that very purpose.

8

And the PAC issue that has been discussed -- you

9

probably have heard more than you want to hear about

10

this law in any event, and certainly about the PACs.

11

But the PAC issue that I want to address and the

12

media exemption.
On PACs, we've heard about that the labor

13
14

unions and how hard it is for the AFL-CIO and what

15

evidence there is in the record.

16

election cycle, labor unions contributed $53 million

17

from their PACs in contributions and expenditures.

18

And that's not including the treasury funds that they

19

use to run the kind of electioneering ads that are

20

included in our submission.

Okay, in the 2000

I guess the other two organizations that

21
22

were named were the National Rifle Association and

23

the ACLU.

24

extra money left in its PAC in the last election

25

cycle that it ended up spending millions of dollars

The National Rifle Association had so much

on things that it wasn't even required to use PAC

2

money for.

3

those 4 million members gives $10 a year, they will

4

have one of the biggest -- probably the biggest PAC

5

in history, $40 million.

6

It has 4 million members.

If each of

And there is no showing whatsoever --

7

they've just raised their dues from $25 to $35.

8

they just say the dues are still $25.

believe with us that political advocacy in this case

12

Amendment is, please give us $10.

But in all

seriousness, Mr. Chief Justice, I will be one of the

21

happiest people on the face of the planet when I sit

22

down today, however you decide.

challenge, a facial challenge.

advocacy test, the contribution limits and
