ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. HURD:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Our Virginia cross-burning statute protects a

11

very important freedom, freedom from fear, and it does so

12

without compromising freedom of speech.

13

not ban all cross-burning, only cross-burning used to

14

threaten bodily harm.

15

our statute does not play favorites.

16

cross-burning as a tool of intimidation by anyone, against

17

anyone, and for any reason.

18

why we can ban threats of bodily harm, 100 times over we

19

can ban this exceedingly virulent weapon of fear.

20

QUESTION:

Our statute does

And unlike the ordinance in R.A.V.,
It bans

Surely, for all the reasons

Mr. Hurd, I -- there's one part of

21

the statute that may be troublesome, and that is the prima

22

facie evidence provision.

23

cross-burning, for instance, in a play, in a theater,

24

something like that, which in theory shouldn't violate the

25

statute, but here's the prima facie evidence provision.

I suppose you could have a

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Would you like to comment about that, and in the process,

2

would you tell me if you think it's severable, or what's

3

the story on that -MR. HURD:

4

Justice O'Connor, I would like to

5

comment about that. There are three major points I would

6

like to make.
First is the inference is simply a common sense

7
8

rule of evidence.

It says that a burning cross may be

9

presumed to mean what we all know it ordinarily does mean,

10

a threat of bodily harm.

11

a prosecutor could argue if the inference were not there.
QUESTION:

12
13

18

MR. HURD:

The jury is not required to accept.

QUESTION:

No.

MR. HURD:

Where the inference is given, yes,

It's --

16
17

And the jury is instructed

accordingly by the judge?

14
15

And so it says no more than what

Is the jury so instructed by the

judge?

19

Your Honor, it -- it is so instructed, and was so

20

instructed in -- in the Black case, though not in the

21

Elliott case.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Do we have the instruction that was

given in the Black case?
MR. HURD:
the appendix.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

It appears in

The instruction is a burning cross --

QUESTION:

What page?

Are you talking about the

joint appendix?

3

MR. HURD:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

And where would that be?

5

MR. HURD:

Instruction number 9 in the joint

6
7
8
9

appendix.

I apologize for the delay.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe you -- maybe you should

tell us later, and proceed.
MR. HURD:

On page 146.

The burning of a cross

10

by itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer

11

the required intent.

12
13

QUESTION:

It didn't say that they -- it just

said the positive, that they could make such an inference.

14

MR. HURD:

15

purely permissive inference.

16

burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was

17

an intent to intimidate.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

It is a

The prosecution retains the

In this -- in the particular cases

19

before us, what evidence, other than the burning itself,

20

was there to show intimidation?

21

MR. HURD:

What we had in the case of -- of

22

Barry Black was he heard that -- he's from Pennsylvania,

23

and he heard that down in Carroll County, blacks and

24

whites were holding hands on the sidewalk.

25

came down.

And so they

He came down, and they had this event.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

They

1

chose a spot near an open stretch of highway where they

2

erected a 30-foot cross.

3

And they burned it at night with a loudspeaker and talk

4

about taking a .30/.30 and randomly shooting blacks.

5

QUESTION:

That's as high as these columns.

Now, was that -- did that intimidate

6

everyone who drove by in their passenger vehicle or --

7

let's put it this way -- racial minorities who drove by in

8

their passenger vehicle?

9

MR. HURD:

All of those were intimidated?

Whether or not there was actual

10

intimidation of minorities who drove by was not clearly

11

established by the record.

12

record that a black family did drive by, pause, saw it,

13

and took off at a higher than normal rate of speed.

14

QUESTION:

There was evidence in the

Yes, but surely they were in no fear

15

of immediate violence, and our -- our Brandenburg line of

16

cases says there must be an element of immediacy --

17

MR. HURD:

Justice Kennedy --

18

QUESTION:

-- before you can punish speech by

19
20

reason of its content.
MR. HURD:

Brandenburg was an incitement case,

21

not -- not a threat case, although there was a

22

cross-burning in Brandenburg --

23

QUESTION:

Well, then if I -- if I have a

24

picture of a burning cross, and I -- and I give it to

25

somebody, that's --

MR. HURD:
a burning cross.

No, Your Honor.

There has to be a --

In Brandenburg --

QUESTION:

Isn't that because there's an

immediacy element to the threat?
MR. HURD:

Well, we believe, Your Honor, that --

6

that if you read into the -- the threat jurisprudence an

7

immediacy element, then -- two points I would make.

8

Number one is that you would -- you would

9

constitutionalize threats when someone said, I'm going to

10

kill you, but it won't be for a little while.

11

can't be the case.

12

would be constitutional so long as the -- the time when

13

the threat was going to be delivered was delayed.

14

QUESTION:

Surely that

A threat, say, against the President

Well, that -- that may be -- that may

15

be a different -- so -- so in your view if a burning cross

16

is just put on a hill outside of the city, everybody in

17

the city can be deemed intimidated?

18

MR. HURD:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

The --

19

the burning cross carries not merely a message of

20

intimidation, but -- a -- a threat of bodily harm, but a

21

threat of bodily harm soon to arrive.

22

QUESTION:

Now, the --

Why doesn't Virginia just have a

23

statute making it a crime to threaten bodily harm that's

24

soon to arrive --

25

MR. HURD:

Well, we --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

-- burning cross or not?

2

MR. HURD:

We could have such a statute, Your

3

Honor, but the -- the availability of other options does

4

not mean the option we have chosen is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

5

Do other States have criminal

6

statutes that have the broad-based intimidation

7

prohibition that I've just described?
MR. HURD:

8
9

may.

Your Honor, some -- some very well

Again --

10

QUESTION:

I have not found one.

11

MR. HURD:

Respectfully, that -- that event

12

would not -- would not be the test we believe established

13

by this Court in R.A.V.

14

Moreover, Your Honor, there's a -- there's a

15

down side to having a broad statute, and it is this.

16

whenever you prohibit a proscribable category of speech,

17

there will be a -- a zone of protected speech that looks a

18

lot like the proscribed category and in which people must

19

be somewhat careful or they may be arrested mistakenly, as

20

happened with Mr. Watts in the Watts case.

21

QUESTION:

22

is not just speech.

23

that -- that is intended to convey a message.

That

I thought the key here is that this
It is not just speech.

It's action

24

MR. HURD:

It is --

25

QUESTION:

Surely -- surely your State could

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

make it unlawful to brandish -- brandish an automatic

2

weapon with the intent of -- of intimidating somebody,

3

couldn't it?
MR. HURD:

4

Justice Scalia, we -- we have

5

statutes that prohibit brandishing of firearms.

In fact,

6

a -- a burning cross is very much like a brandishing of a

7

firearm.

8

QUESTION:

That's your point.

9

MR. HURD:

It is virtually -- it is virtually

10

a -- a present offer of force.

That makes it an

11

especially virulent form of -- of intimidation.
Let me, if I may, come back to Justice

12
13

O'Connor's point about the inference.

14

you asked whether the inference could be struck down,

15

severed.

16

absolutely.

17

problematic, under Virginia law, as we cite in our briefs,

18

it is -- it is severable.

19

statute in Virginia so that if the Court were not to agree

20

with us that this inference is constitutional, it should

21

not declare the entire statute invalid, but should sever

22

the inference and remand these cases for further action.

23

Justice O'Connor,

We believe the answer to that question is -- is
If this Court were to decide it was

QUESTION:

We have a general severability

Well, just to make it clear, anytime

24

in Virginia a burning cross is put near a highway, that is

25

an -- a criminal offense.

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, it is a criminal offense

to burn a cross with intent to intimidate.

Now, what --

3

QUESTION:

Even on your own property.

4

QUESTION:

No, not on your own --

5

MR. HURD:

On your own property if it is a -- a

6

public place.

7

actually on a jury instruction -- as being not public

8

ownership, but public view.

9
10

A public place is defined in our statute --

QUESTION:

And intimidate means to cause fear of

violence at some unspecified time in the future --

11

MR. HURD:

To -- to --

12

QUESTION:

-- from some unspecified people.

13

MR. HURD:

To instill fear of -- of bodily harm.

14

The specificity of the people is not hard to figure out.

15

It's whoever burns the cross is the one who is delivering

16

the threat.

17

Justice Kennedy, there -- there are --

QUESTION:

May I ask -- may I ask you a question

18

on -- about instruction 9 to which you called our

19

attention?

20

burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from

21

which you may infer the required intent.

22

it is sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt by which you

23

can do it?

24
25

It says, the court instructs the jury that the

MR. HURD:

Does that mean

Certainly the jury could, by this

instruction, by the burning cross infer -- infer guilt.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

So that in -- in a case in which

2

there was a cross burned out in the middle of a desert

3

somewhere, and that's all that's proved, that would be

4

enough to sustain the conviction.
MR. HURD:

5
6

That would be enough to -- to get you

past a motion to strike.
QUESTION:

7

Of course, sustaining a --

Let's say there's no -- the defendant

8

puts in no evidence, just rests on the -- on -- on just

9

remains mute.

10

He could be convicted on it in that case,

I think.

11

MR. HURD:

12

could be convicted.

13

than a burning cross.

14

Honor --

15

QUESTION:

If the instruction were given, he
Of course, in this case, we have more
And his -- his argument, Your

I understand that.

But then my next

16

question is -- I'm asking about whether there's content

17

discrimination.

18

could not be convicted on the same evidence.

19
20
21

Supposing he burned a -- a circle, he

MR. HURD:

He could not.

A burning circle,

unlike a burning cross, carries no particular message.
And, Justice Stevens, I would -- I would point

22

out that where this Court has previously struck down

23

evidentiary inferences, it has done so under the Due

24

Process Clause.

25

QUESTION:

In the case of a desert, he's out in

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the desert, and he's burning the cross for symbolic

2

purposes and nobody else is around.

3

judge have to set aside the conviction on -- on First

4

Amendment grounds.

5

MR. HURD:

I guess wouldn't the

Justice Breyer, absolutely.

6

There's -- there's -- the General Assembly chose this word

7

very carefully when it said a prima facie case.

8

supreme court was very careful when they said, based on

9

that language, it would survive a motion to strike, but

The State

10

there's no attempt in the statute to preclude the kind of

11

independent post-conviction review as required in First

12

Amendment cases.

13

So absolutely in that case, if -- if -- first of

14

all, if the police made an arrest, which is doubtful, and

15

if it was prosecuted, which is doubtful, and if the jury

16

found guilt, which is doubtful, then the court could in

17

that case and should in that case vacate the conviction.

18

QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's fine if you use

19

the term prima facie case, which is what the statute says.

20

But the instruction here said the burning of a cross by

21

itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the

22

required intent.

23

accurate conveyance to the jury of what is meant by prima

24

facie case.

25

And you think that's an accurate -- an

MR. HURD:

The -- the -- that obviously was not

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the only instruction given, Justice Scalia.

2

QUESTION:

I understand.

3

MR. HURD:

There was also instructions given

4

that -- that required the prosecution to prove its case

5

beyond a -- a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

6

And --

But -- but then it goes on to say the

7

burning of a cross is sufficient evidence from which you

8

may infer the -- the required intent.

9

MR. HURD:

May, but -- but need not necessarily.

10

QUESTION:

Need -- no, not necessarily.

But

11

that seems to me to be much more than what you now

12

describe as the consequence of a prima facie case.

13

Just -- just one that gets you past a -- a motion to

14

dismiss.

15

MR. HURD:

Well, the -- the jury --

16

QUESTION:

It says it's sufficient evidence to

17
18

find it if -- if that's all you -MR. HURD:

And Justice Scalia, if there were a

19

problem with that instruction, it would be in our view

20

a -- a due process problem, not a First Amendment problem.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I thought there would be a

22

First Amendment problem in the unusual hypothetical

23

instance of the desert, where they gave this instruction

24

and the very thirsty jury convicted the person under this

25

instruction.

Were that to happen, then that might violate

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the First Amendment since there was no evidence in the

2

case that this was going to intimidate a person, and the

3

only basis for a conviction would have been the

4

instruction of the State.

5

I guess the State instruction permitting conviction would

6

violate the First Amendment.

7

QUESTION:

And under those circumstances,

In other words, every due process

8

violation in a First Amendment case is a First Amendment

9

violation.

10

QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

11

QUESTION:

But that's quite a far --

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HURD:

Justice Scalia, Justice Breyer, in

14

any event that very unusual case would present an

15

as-applied challenge.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you --

17

QUESTION:

I agree it's unusual.

18

QUESTION:

-- about a more -- a more -- case of

19

immediate concern?

You have said that the cross --

20

burning cross is a symbol like no other.

21

self-contained category.

22

associated with the Klan?

23

and the mask?

24

ban, or is there something about the burning cross that

25

makes it unique?

And so this is a

What about other things that are

Are they also symbols that the State can

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HURD:

Justice Ginsburg, there -- there are

2

several things about the burning cross that make it

3

unique.
First, it is the symbol that the Klan has used

4
5

to -- to threaten bodily harm.

6

will, in our history is -- is between the burning cross

7

and ensuing violence, not so much between people wearing

8

white sheets and ensuing violence.
QUESTION:

9

The connection, if you

Isn't there a Federal statute that

10

makes it -- makes it an offense to go on the highway

11

wearing a -- wearing a sheet?

12

QUESTION:

In disguise.

13

MR. HURD:

And going in disguise on the highway

14

with a particular intent -- I believe there is.

15

have a statute in -- in Virginia.
One of the things -- let me -- let me make this

16
17

And we

point about the burning cross --

18

QUESTION:

I -- I --

19

MR. HURD:

-- and why it's -- why it's unique.

20

QUESTION:

You're saying it's not unique then if

21

you could also make going on the highway in disguise a

22

crime.

23

MR. HURD:

Well, I think going on the highway in

24

disguise is -- is a different kind of -- of concern.

25

It's -- it's the same kind of concern that might, in a

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

variety of cases, prevent people from disguising their

2

identity from -- from law enforcement.
But in terms of -- of delivering symbols and

3
4

delivering threats, it really is unique.

5

says, we're close at hand.

6

And it deliberately invokes the precedent of 87 years of

7

cross-burning as a tool of intimidation.

9

We don't just talk.

Burn anything else.

sheet.

It says -- it

Burn the flag.

We act.

Burn a

The message is opposition to the thing that the

10

symbol unburned represents.

Burning a cross is not

11

opposition to Christianity.

The message is a threat of

12

bodily harm, and it -- it is unique.

13

a message of bigotry.

14

has it in their hands, a message of bodily harm is coming.

15

That is the primary message --

16

QUESTION:

And it's not simply

It's a message that -- that whoever

It sounds to me like you're defending

17

the statute on the ground that the message that this

18

particular act conveys is particularly obnoxious.

19

MR. HURD:

Obnoxious.

Justice Stevens, we have

20

a lot of obnoxious speech, and it's all perfectly fine.

21

This is not obnoxious speech.

22

bodily harm.

23

This is a -- a threat of

Justice Souter made the point in the concurrence

24

in -- in Hill v. Colorado the Government may punish

25

certain types of expressive conduct even though that

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

conduct is associated with a particular point of view.

2

Those who burn draft cards typically oppose the draft.

3

Those who engage in sidewalk counseling typically oppose

4

abortion.

5

activities.

6

But we can oppose restrictions on those

Similarly, we can ban cross burning as a tool of

7

intimidation even though many people who practice

8

cross-burning may also carry with that cross-burning some

9

message of bigotry.

10
11

But the primary message -- the

fundamental message is a threat of bodily harm.
And this is not something that we just made up.

12

Cross-burning has that message because for decades the

13

Klan wanted it to have that message because they wanted

14

that tool of intimidation.

15

hollow when the Klan comes to court and complains that our

16

law treats that message -- treats that burning cross as

17

having exactly the message that they for decades have

18

wanted it to have.

19

And so it rings a little

And so, we do believe that our statute is -- is

20

quite constitutional.

They may have a political rally

21

with a burning cross, but what they cannot do is use a

22

Klan ceremony as a way to smuggle through real threats of

23

bodily harm with a specific intent to intimidate.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

9

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
Virginia has singled out cross-burning with the

13

intent to intimidate because it is a particularly

14

threatening form of such conduct.

15

that cross-burning has been used as a tool to intimidate

16

and put people in fear of bodily violence in a way that no

17

other symbol has been used.

18

QUESTION:

History has revealed

Does it fall under the fighting words

19

notion, or is it a separate category of constitutionally

20

proscribable speech do you suppose?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, our analysis of

22

the intimidation element is that it's akin to a threat to

23

put somebody in bodily harm.

24

QUESTION:

25

And as such --

Is it -- is it a defense under the

statute for someone to prove that they didn't intend to

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

threaten anyone, but just purely to express a viewpoint?
MR. DREEBEN:

Apart from the presumption or

3

prima facie case provision that Your Honor called

4

attention to earlier, the prohibitory language of the

5

statute does not reach cross-burning when it is done

6

solely for the point of expressing a particular view.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

And how -- how do you look at the

statute in light of the prima facie evidence provision?
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, it raises

10

separate issues that are distinct from whether a

11

cross-burning statute can single out that particular

12

activity and prohibit it on the basis of its

13

threatening --

14

QUESTION:

15

we have to look at, isn't it?

16

But that's part of this statute that

MR. DREEBEN:

It is, but the Virginia Supreme

17

Court approached the issue by first asking whether the

18

cross-burning provision, insofar as it targeted

19

cross-burning --

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

-- ran afoul of this Court's

22

decision in R.A.V., and it only then turned to the prima

23

facie case provision --

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

-- and concluded that it rendered

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute overbroad.
The United States has not taken a position on

2
3

the validity of the prima facie case provision, which does

4

raise distinct issues because it could allow a jury in

5

certain instances to infer solely from the act of

6

cross-burning, without any other evidence at all -QUESTION:

7
8

And that was the instruction given

here.
MR. DREEBEN:

9
10

one of the two cases.

11

instruction --

That was the instruction given in
In the Elliott case, there was no

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

-- whatsoever on the prima facie

14

case provision, and so Elliott's case is somewhat

15

similar -- differently situated from -- from the Black

16

case.

17

But a cross-burning statute like this functions

18

not like a fighting words statute which seeks to avert

19

breaches of the peace by the use of particularly obnoxious

20

language that would induce anybody to strike back with a

21

violent reaction.

22

a signal to violence, or a warning that violence will come

23

is not protected within the First Amendment.

24

prohibited form of conduct, and when done as here by an

25

act of putting a flaming cross in a place with the intent

It functions instead on the theory that

It is a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to actually put somebody in fear of bodily harm, it's not

2

a form of protected conduct that directly implicates the

3

First Amendment.

4

It's --

QUESTION:

Is it -- is it unlawful in Virginia

5

to put somebody in fear of bodily harm in some other

6

fashion, not to burn a cross, but to say I'm going to

7

lynch you?

8
9

Is that -- is that unlawful in Virginia?

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, my understanding

of Virginia law is that it has a -- a written threats

10

statute which would cover any threat of any kind in

11

writing, but it does not have a general intimidation or

12

threat statute that would reach other means of oral

13

expression.

14

QUESTION:

It's sort of peculiar, isn't it?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, what Virginia has done is

16

take something which has historically been used as a

17

particularly dangerous means of intimidation because it

18

has so often been followed up by actual violence and

19

establish a prohibition that is limited to that.

20

than sweeping in other classes of speech that may raise

21

questions when you come close to the line of whether it is

22

or isn't intimidating and therefore might chill free

23

expression, Virginia has chosen to focus on what conduct

24

occurred within its borders that caused particular harms.

25

And what --

QUESTION:

Was -- was there a common law of

intimidation, a tort -- a tort that went beyond assault?
MR. DREEBEN:

3

There is a common law of -- of

4

putting somebody in fear of bodily harm through the tort

5

law.

6

provisions that are --

7
8
9

And there were similarly antecedent criminal

QUESTION:

Is there -- is there an immediacy

component to that as there is with assaults?
MR. DREEBEN:

No, there is not, Justice Kennedy,

10

and it's crucial to underscore why that is.

11

that can be brought about by threat statutes are not only

12

putting somebody in fear of bodily harm and thereby

13

disrupting their movements, but providing a signal that

14

the violence may actually occur.

15

tomorrow, the next day, or next week, but it's like a

16

sword of Damocles hanging over the person whose head --

17

who has been threatened.

18

pervasive fear that can be ongoing for a considerable

19

amount of time.

20

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24

QUESTION:

25

This

1952 originally.

Now, it's my understanding that we

had almost 100 years of lynching and activity in the South

22

1

by the Knights of Camellia and -- and the Ku Klux Klan,

2

and this was a reign of terror and the cross was a symbol

3

of that reign of terror.

4

greater than intimidation or a threat?

Was -- isn't that significantly

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

Justice Thomas, because it is --

7

QUESTION:

Well, I think they're coextensive,

Well, my fear is, Mr. Dreeben, that

8

you're actually understating the symbolism on -- of and

9

the effect of the cross, the burning cross.

I --

10

I indicated, I think, in the Ohio case that the cross was

11

not a religious symbol and that it has -- it was intended

12

to have a virulent effect.

13

you're attempting to do is to fit this into our

14

jurisprudence rather than stating more clearly what the

15

cross was intended to accomplish and, indeed, that it is

16

unlike any symbol in our society.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

And I -- I think that what

Well, I don't mean to understate

18

it, and I entirely agree with Your Honor's description of

19

how the cross has been used as an instrument of

20

intimidation against minorities in this country.

21

justified 14 States in treating it as a distinctive --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:
minorities.

That has

Well, it's -- it's actually more than

There's certain groups.

And I -- I just -- my fear is that the -- there
was no other purpose to the cross.

There was no

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

communication of a particular message.

2

cause fear --

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DREEBEN:

It was intended to

It --

-- and to terrorize a population.
It absolutely was, and for that

6

reason can be legitimately proscribed without fear that

7

the focusing on a cross -- burning of a cross with the

8

intent to intimidate would chill protected expression.
This is a very different case than the R.A.V.

9
10

case that was before the Court.

11

confronted with a statute that prohibited the use of

12

language based on particular messages of group-based

13

hatred.

14

the State was expressing disagreement with particular

15

messages.

16

There the Court was

And in singling out speech based on the content,

In the Virginia statute, and in the other

17

statutes that the States have, the focus is not on any

18

particular message.

19

and the intent to create a climate of fear and, as Justice

20

Thomas has said, a climate of terror.

21

QUESTION:

It is on the effect of intimidation,

So your argument would be the same

22

even if we assumed that the capacity of the cross to

23

convey this message was limited to certain groups, blacks,

24

Catholics, or whatnot.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I would, Justice Souter, and I

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think it's for the reason that Your Honor pointed out in

2

his concurrence in Hill versus Colorado.

3

particular activity might have become the signature of a

4

certain ideological group does not prevent the State from

5

addressing and regulating what is proscribable about that

6

activity.
QUESTION:

7

Merely because a

But it seems to me from this

8

argument, if the message is as powerful as Justice Thomas

9

suggests it is -- and I'm sure he's -- he's right about

10

that -- why is it necessary to go beyond the message

11

itself?

12

if the person burning it didn't realize all of this

13

history, just did it innocently, but it nevertheless had

14

that effect?

Why -- why wouldn't it still be proscribable even

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that would --

Why do you need the intent?
I think that would raise a much

18

more difficult question because notwithstanding the fact

19

that there is a very powerful linkage in our society such

20

that the State is justified in singling out the cross, it

21

may be that under certain contexts, a particular

22

individual is attempting to express a message rather than

23

attempting to intimidate.

24
25

And it -- it is important to note that merely
expressing a message of race-based hatred is not something

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

3

that the State can proscribe -QUESTION:

Surely -- surely one can burn a cross

in the sanctity of one's bedroom.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Right?

There -- there are -- there are

6

hypothetical cases that one can imagine, the desert, the

7

bedroom --

8
9

QUESTION:

No, but my assumption is that the

geographic scope of the statute is just like this statute.

10

It doesn't apply to your own property, but on anyone

11

else's property, or in public view.

12

powerful as -- as we're assuming as it is, why isn't that

13

a sufficient basis for just banning it?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

If the message is as

It might well be, Justice Stevens,

15

but I think that a law that is more tailored, as this one

16

is, and reaches those acts of cross-burning where it is

17

the very intent of the actor to put a person or group of

18

people in fear of bodily harm makes it quite clear that

19

a -- that statute aims at the proscribable feature of that

20

conduct and not at the protected feature, namely

21

race-based hatred.

22

QUESTION:

But if you can infer the -- the

23

intent to intimidate just from the act, even when this is

24

done on one's own property, as it was in one of these

25

cases, doesn't that go beyond the line, if -- if you --

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cross-burning on your own property?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens, may I answer?

3

Justice Ginsburg, the inference provision is

4

problematic because it does raise the potential that a

5

wholly protected act of cross-burning, which this Court

6

might find within the scope of the First Amendment, could

7

serve as the exclusive source of evidence from which a

8

conviction could be rendered for unprotected conduct.

9

it's for that reason that most States don't have any sort

And

10

of analogous provision.

The Federal Government doesn't,

11

and it raises distinct problems from the targeting focus

12

of the law that's at issue here.

19

Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.

MR. SMOLLA:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
At the heart of our argument is that when the

ritual, it engages in content and viewpoint discrimination

22

of the type forbidden by the First Amendment.

What -- what about the symbol of

brandishing an automatic weapon in -- in somebody's face?
MR. SMOLLA:

Justice Scalia, I think --

1

QUESTION:

You're next.

2

MR. SMOLLA:

I think that a core element of our

3

argument is that there is a fundamental First Amendment

4

difference between brandishing a cross, and brandishing a

5

gun.

6

potency to the threat, and so if the State makes a threat

7

committed with a firearm an especially heinous type of

8

threat, it is acting within the confines of what is

9

permissible under R.A.V. because it is creating a subclass

The physical properties of the gun as a weapon add

10

of threat and defining that subclass of threat for the

11

same reasons that allow it to define the outer perimeter

12

of threat law, things going to the danger posed by that

13

threat.

14

But the properties of the cross are not physical

15

properties, and the burning element of a burning cross are

16

not what communicate the threat.

17

QUESTION:

But is -- isn't the -- isn't your

18

argument an argument that would have been sound before the

21

somebody brandishing the loaded gun, and somebody

22

24

to me, would be -- would be a winning one.

25

If we

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the cross has acquired a potency which I would

2

suppose is at least as equal to that of the gun?

3

MR. SMOLLA:

Justice Souter, I think that our

4

argument is that in fact it works the reverse way, that

5

what the cross and the burning cross have acquired as a

6

kind of secondary meaning, somewhat akin to the way that

7

trademarks acquire secondary meaning in intellectual

8

property law, are a multiplicity of messages.

9

a burning cross identified as -- as effectively the

10

trademark of the Ku Klux Klan carries horrible

11

connotations of terrorism of the kind --

12

QUESTION:

Undoubtedly

But it -- it carries something else,

13

doesn't it?

14

acquired a meaning?

15

signal so that when that signal is given, the natural

16

human response is not recognition of a message, but fear?

17

Isn't it not merely a -- a trademark that has
Isn't it also a kind of Pavlovian

MR. SMOLLA:

No, Your Honor.

Respectfully

18

I think that that overstates what is being communicated.

19

Any symbol in its pristine state that has gathered

20

reverence in our society -- the American flag, the Star of

21

David, the cross, the symbols of government -- is a

22

powerful, emotional symbol in -- in its revered state.

QUESTION:

But they don't make -- they don't

make you scared, and if you start -- for your own safety.

MR. SMOLLA:

Justice -What is this midpoint?
Justice Kennedy, it is the

where the interest of the State goes beyond just

preventing physical crime.

acts of violence, threats, intimidation that are done out

of bias and animus.

conceivable State interests that there could possibly

be --

That captures the fullness of all the

Well, that was in conjunction with an

actual physical assault.
MR. SMOLLA:

But -- but, Your Honor, in any

17

instance in which the State were operating upon some

18

conduct that it is constitutionally permissible to

19

proscribe, such as a threat, the State could then enhance

20

the penalty.

get double the penalty, triple the penalty.

enhanced?

2

MR. SMOLLA:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and even more -Well, how can you have a statutory

4

category which enhances the penalty that you can't also

5

use to -- to describe the underlying offense?

6

MR. SMOLLA:

The -- the answer to that question,

7

Justice Kennedy, lies in Wisconsin versus Mitchell where

8

this Court held that the mere evidentiary use of speech to

9

prove intent does not implicate the First Amendment.

And

10

although the line is thin, it is gigantic in terms of our

11

First Amendment values.

12

QUESTION:

It is the difference --

Well, let me ask you this.

Supposing

13

you have a statute that prohibits intimidation by burning

14

circles, any -- any design of any kind, and the maximum

15

penalty is a year in jail, but if you burn a cross, it's

16

2 years in jail.

17
18

Would that be permissible?

MR. SMOLLA:

Honor, and the reason it --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SMOLLA:

21
22

It would not be permissible, Your

And -- and it's --- would not be permissible is the

cross has acquired this meaning as an ideological symbol.
QUESTION:

Because it's content-based

23

discrimination within the category of activity that can be

24

entirely proscribed.

25

MR. SMOLLA:

That is precisely our argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

2

QUESTION:

Now, is there any support for that

proposition other than the majority opinion in R.A.V.?
MR. SMOLLA:

3

Your Honor, R.A.V. is the only case

4

that dealt squarely with this puzzle of what happens when

5

you're dealing with a category of speech that you have the

6

right to proscribe, and then you draw gratuitous content-

7

or viewpoint-based distinctions within it.
However, Justice Stevens, I would say that it

8
9

isn't alone in this Court's powerful condemnation of

10

viewpoint discrimination, and a key element to this

11

Court's First Amendment history is that we don't want to

12

MR. SMOLLA:

And -- and at the core of our

2

argument, Justice Scalia, is the claim that the concept of

3

viewpoint discrimination is, and ought to be broad enough

4

to encompass not only viewpoint discrimination articulated

5

linguistically, the way that it was done in the statute in

6

R.A.V., but also viewpoint discrimination through the

7

singling out of a symbol because symbols acquire meaning

8

in precisely the same way that words acquire meaning.

QUESTION:

But words -- words are even more.

I mean, your argument applies a fortiori to words.

11

MR. SMOLLA:

12

QUESTION:

Right?

It does, Justice Breyer.
I guess you could have statutes, if

13

the need were great, that forbid you from using certain

14

words with a certain intent like, for example,

15

impersonating somebody or -- or counterfeiting, or -- I

characterization of the question.

if this is viewpoint discrimination because --

Well, why shouldn't we apply --- this Court's been hostile to

And -- and accepting

MR. SMOLLA:

Why -- why some

Your Honor, whether you apply

20

O'Brien or strict scrutiny, it's our submission we win

21

because when you get to the point at which you look at

22

alternatives, there are content-neutral alternatives that

23

work perfectly as well.

24
25

But to answer directly your question, Justice
O'Connor, this Court has never allowed the use of the

O'Brien test or any of the cousins of O'Brien, such as the

2

secondary effects doctrine or time, place, or manner

3

jurisprudence, when the harm that the government seeks to

4

prevent is a harm that flows from the communicative impact

5

of the expression.

6

And there is no getting around the fact that the

7

harm the government seeks to prevent here indubitably

8

flows only from the formation of this symbol.

QUESTION:

If I --

So I would think then that if the

10

test suggests that you cannot have a statute which says

11

you cannot use the words, I'll kill you, with an intent to

12

kill somebody or threaten him, then there's something

13

wrong with the test, not that there's something wrong with

14

the statute.

That's --

Your Honor, take the -- take the

1

discrimination in our minds when we think of the burning

because even if at a given moment in time, you could take

Well, I guess what -- you have a very

interesting point.

And as I've been thinking about it, it

seems to me that the -- a difficulty, possible difficulty

with it is that the First Amendment doesn't protect words.

It protects use of words for certain purposes.

doesn't protect, for example, a -- a symbol.

play, but not when used as a threat --

3

MR. SMOLLA:

That is correct.
-- so it doesn't protect the burning

of the cross when used as a threat --

6

MR. SMOLLA:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SMOLLA:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct.
-- and not as a symbol.
That is -- that -And now we have a statute that says

10

you can use it as a symbol, but you can't use it as a

11

threat.

And therefore, the First Amendment doesn't apply.

12

MR. SMOLLA:

13

QUESTION:

15
16

Now, if that's the right analysis,

then what's your response?
MR. SMOLLA:

Your Honor, that -- that everything

-- we would not accept.

I have a -- I have a hunch I have

to at least say that much.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. SMOLLA:

And -- and, Justice Breyer, it

24

comes to this, that you cannot make the judgment that this

law in its actual impact only penalizes those acts of

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cross-burning that result in threat.

It certainly chills,

2

Justice Breyer, a wide range of expression, as it did in

3

this case, that cannot plausibly be understood as a threat

4

of bodily harm in any realistic sense.
Every time the Ku Klux Klan conducts one of its

5
6

rallies, at the height of its rally, it burns a large

7

cross, and it plays a hymn such as the Old Rugged Cross,

8

or Onward Christian Soldiers or Amazing Grace, and this is

9

a ritual that it engages in.

Now, it is inconceivable --

10

there is absolutely nothing in this record that says that

11

every time the Klan does that, that is, in fact, a true

12

threat.
QUESTION:

13

No, it isn't, so long as the Klan

14

doesn't do it in -- in sight of a public highway, or on

15

somebody else's property, there's not a chance that this

16

statute would apply to them.

MR. SMOLLA:

20

Your Honor, but the -They have to do in sight of a public

highway?
MR. SMOLLA:

The -- the -- all the statute

requires is that it be visible to others.

And of course,

22

the First Amendment value here in our view is that speech,

particularly disturbing and offensive speech that runs

contrary to our -- our mainstream values that the majority

25

of us embrace, is ineffective unless it is put out to the

QUESTION:

7

In many societies in this

I want you just to address -- but

8

it's hard for you because you have clients with different

interests here perhaps.

But -- but if -- if it's right

10

that you can ban speech, i.e., the use of words for

11

purposes of threatening people with bodily harm, which I

12

think we can, then what about this prima facie

13

prohibition?
The way I was thinking about it, to get you to

14
15

respond, is if you did have a statute that was

16

constitutional that said it is a crime to use the words, I

will kill you, with the intent to threaten someone with

infer from the use of the words themselves on a particular

occasion that the threat existed.

whether it's the 19th century burning cross before the

just a cross before we get to the burning part, a symbol

14

that you must concede is one of the most powerful

15

religious symbols in -- in human history.

16

is the symbol of Christianity, the symbol of the

17

crucifixion of Christ.

18

the same way as when the flag is burned, undoubtedly the

19

burner is playing on that underlying positive repository

20

of meaning to make the intense negative point, often a

21

point that strikes as horrible and as evil and disgusting,

have a threatening meaning.

10

MR. SMOLLA:

They may not, Justice Stevens.
I think they're often used in casual

conversation without any such threatening meaning at all.
MR. SMOLLA:

Justice Stevens, I accept that.

14

But I -- I'm merely making the argument that you can fit a

phrase such as the words, I will kill you, within the

16

exceptions to R.A.V. in a way that you cannot fit

cross-burning within the exceptions to R.A.V. or

particular words, or -- or the burning of a -- of a

symbol, even if you qualify that by saying you -- it's

monopolized those words because people who are using them

from different purposes will be afraid to use them.

difference, Justice Scalia, between burning a draft card

7

and burning a cross or burning a flag, that -- that the

8

reason O'Brien -- the draft card case -- allowed the

9

government to punish burning the draft card was that the

10

draft card had a functional purpose -- the administration

11

of the Selective Service System -- that had nothing to do

12

with what was being expressed when one burned the draft

card.

14

The gun is like that.

is a functional element to the gun.

MR. SMOLLA:

It is -- it's still -- it's still a

different from a cross.
If -- if I -- take a torch.

5

What would be the

difference between brandishing a torch and brandishing a

7

cross?

If I -- if I take two wooden sticks --

QUESTION:

100 years -- 100 years of history.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. SMOLLA:

Exactly, Justice Kennedy, that's

11

the difference.

And that 100 years of history is on the

12

side of freedom of speech, that it is 100 years of history

13

that a particular group has -- has capitalized on this

14

particular ritual to make not only points that are

15

threatening, but to advance their agenda.
QUESTION:

16

All right.

We'll -- we'll accept --

17

I mean, I think we accept that, but we -- our problem is

18

that the 100 years have also added something else, and

19

that is the kind of specific Pavlovian quality that I

spoke of.

whether we should classify this in the O'Brien direction,

22

or the flag direction, what's the -- what's the -- in

effect, the tie-breaker?

And if that is giving us difficulty in deciding

MR. SMOLLA:

Your Honor, I think the tie-breaker

is what I've kept coming back to a number of times, which

is really would there be any fall-off through

any fall-off through content-neutral alternatives, then

4

err on the side of freedom of speech.
Imagine that you have two rallies going on

side-by-side.

The -- the Klan is going to make -- engage

7

in a rally, and then a group that wants to counter the

8

Klan's message, a Christian group, has a counter-rally in

9

a public forum in Richmond.

And imagine that at the

10

height of those two rallies, the Klan ignites its cross.

11

Under this statute, the Klan can be prosecuted, the other

12

group cannot.

It's --

QUESTION:

I thought Mr. Hurd told us that in

getting at.

cross-burning at this rally -- this was no ordinary rally.

This was in response to something that the Klan opposed.
MR. SMOLLA:

And -- and I think, Justice

3

Ginsburg, again to think about this in content-neutral

4

terms, the First Amendment would not forbid the government

5

charging the Klan in the case that we have with an

6

ordinary, run-of-the-mill threat law, or a hate crime law,

7

such as a bias enhancement statute, and then introducing

8

the fact that the cross was burned as evidence of the

9

threat, and as part of the emotional atmospheric of the

10

case to try to convince a jury of the heinousness and the

11

seriousness of the threat.

12

That was approved by this Court in Wisconsin

13

versus Mitchell, and it may seem not worth the candle.

14

may seem that it's just a way to get to the same result

15

through some other formality, but our position is that

16

that is enormous for First Amendment purposes.

Court insists that you use content-neutral alternatives

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. HURD:

Very briefly.

4

Justice Souter, the tie-breaker is the intent to

5

intimidate which is in our statute.

If there's no intent

6

to intimidate, there's no violation here.
Opposing counsel's problem is how does the Klan

7
8

go out in public and burn a cross and have it viewed not

9

as its common, ordinary meaning backed up by 100 years of

10

history.

Well, one thing they could do is not talk about

11

shooting blacks with a .30/.30.

12

there's no intent to intimidate.

That might suggest

Opposing counsel suggests that there should be a

13
14

broader law.

Well, Congress could pass a broader law, one

15

that didn't focus on threats against the President, one

16

that focused on threats against any Federal employee, but

17

this Court has said a broader law is not needed because

18

threats against the President are especially problematic.
So is cross-burning.

19

It is not just hate

20

speech.

It doesn't just say I don't like you because you

21

are black.

22

law cannot help you if you're black or Catholic or Jewish

23

or foreign-born, or we just don't like you, and if you try

24

to live your life as a free American, we are going to kill

25

you.

In the hands of the Klan, the message is the

That is the message of cross-burning backed up by
