ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. HUSZAGH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HUSZAGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It cannot be true that charitable solicitors are

12

free to commit fraud just because they are charitable

13

solicitors.

14

principles, it is unquestionably fraudulent to induce

15

someone to make a gift of money by saying it will be used

16

for a specific charitable purpose when, in fact, only a

17

nominal amount goes to that purpose and the solicitor

18

keeps the vast majority.

Under long-established common law fraud

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HUSZAGH:

21

QUESTION:

charitable purpose?

23

The First Amendment does not --

What about --- displace these principles.

What about 25 percent going to the

MR. HUSZAGH:

25 percent may or may not be a

24

misrepresentation, depending upon what the public was told

25

about the ultimate purpose of --

QUESTION:

The public's told, you know, I'm --

2

I'm soliciting for X charity, would you -- would you give

3

money, please, for X charity --

MR. HUSZAGH:

QUESTION:

MR. HUSZAGH:

QUESTION:

If the public --

-- to help children in Cambodia.
Well --

25 percent of the money actually goes

to that purpose, 25 percent.
MR. HUSZAGH:

If the public reasonably

10

understands that significantly more than that amount goes

11

to that purpose --

12

QUESTION:

I -- I --

13

MR. HUSZAGH:

14

misrepresentation to rely upon --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HUSZAGH:

17

QUESTION:

-- then it would be a

What do we --- that assumption --

-- public opinion poll as to whether

18

the public reasonably understood it was going to be more

19

than 25 percent?

20

MR. HUSZAGH:

Assumptions form a fundamental

21

part of human communication, assumptions about the meaning

22

of language, assumptions -- assumptions about events and

23

conditions.

24

soliciting money to -- for -- for the family of people who

25

died on September 11, and the people they were referring

If somebody were to say that they were

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to were their parents who died of natural causes in

2

Topeka, Kansas, on September 11 of 1995, that's a

3

misrepresentation, because people are entitled to make a

4

reasonable --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HUSZAGH:

7

Sure.
-- assumption about what that

language means.
QUESTION:

8

That was misleading, but it is not

9

misleading to say, I'm going to -- this money is going to

10

go to this charitable cause when, in fact, you acknowledge

11

many charities have to pay substantial amounts,

12

substantial percentages in order to, in order to get

13

organizations to solicit for them, and who -- who is to

14

say that the 25 percent is too much.

15

it is.

16

MR. HUSZAGH:

17

QUESTION:

I've no idea whether

I think that --

You're just going to give that to a

18

jury and leave the fundraising to be liable criminally or

19

not, depending upon whether this jury thinks that

20

25 percent is too little to go, or -- I -- I just -- I'm

21

not comfortable with that at all.

22

MR. HUSZAGH:

I -- I think the Court needs to

23

distinguish between two different types of circumstances.

24

One is the fact that there may be legitimate reasons why a

25

charity could have expenses above a certain level.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

It

1

could be that they're an unpopular charity.

2

that it's a charity that's small, or has recently started

3

up, but those are the types of reasons that the Court used

4

to invalidate laws that declared expenses above a certain

5

threshold to -- to establish that the charity was a sham

6

entirely.

7

It could be

Those don't negate -QUESTION:

It would still be a misrepresentation

8

even if they had good reasons for -- for giving the

9

fundraiser 90 percent of the money.

10

MR. HUSZAGH:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

And --

It would still be a

misrepresentation, wouldn't it?
MR. HUSZAGH:

And that's my point, that the

14

First Amendment should not displace that principle where

15

misrepresentations are determined based upon whether the

16

defendant made a material misrepresentation of fact, and

17

it's -- i is no different from --

18

QUESTION:

Well, would this prosecution have

19

been brought if the fee, if the amount given to the

20

charity had been more substantial?

21

MR. HUSZAGH:

There's a substantial likelihood,

22

or there's less likelihood that such a prosecution would

23

bought, been brought, because --

24
25

QUESTION:

How would anyone know when the

Attorney General would be likely to charge them?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HUSZAGH:

I think really the ultimate

2

question is not whether they're going to know whether the

3

Attorney General is going to bring the case, but whether

4

they've committed fraud.

5

is not going to prosecute every case of fraud that exists,

6

and --

7
8
9

QUESTION:

Ultimately, the Attorney General

Is -- is there an intent requirement,

an intent to defraud requirement under the Illinois law?
MR. HUSZAGH:

As to what we've alleged for

10

common law fraud, yes, there is, and we've made that

11

allegation as -- with respect to all of the statutory

12

antifraud counts as well, and to the extent that there is

13

a concern about the uncertainty as to whether a specific

14

statement may be a misrepresentation, depending upon the

15

inability to predict exactly what the public may know,

16

then certainly there's no such objection if the defendant,

17

it can be proved knew that they were creating a false

18

impression.

19

QUESTION:

But one of your affidavits says that

20

one of the solicitees expressly asked and was told that

21

90 percent or more goes to the vets.

22

that's a classic misrepresentation, is it not?

23

MR. HUSZAGH:

Now, certainly

Yes, it is, but our position goes

24

further, which is that there is no constitutional value in

25

intentional half-truths or artificial, contrived ways of

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

stating something that may be literally true -QUESTION:

No, but the concern that we have is

3

that there's no -- there is no way to predict in advance

4

what is going to be treated or what is going to be found

5

as the half-truth.

6

Let me put the question to you this way.

Leave

7

to the side the moment the particular cases that in --

8

that you include among -- among those you have brought in

9

which at least the allegation is that a very specific

10

misrepresentation was made, no labor cost, 90 percent goes

11

to the -- to the -- the objects of the charity.

12

aside, and consider only the cases in which no

13

representation is made beyond the fact that we are

14

collecting money for this charity, and no representation

15

is made about the amount of money that's going to go for

16

overhead and the amount that's actually going to get to

17

the charitable donees.

Put them

18

I don't see where any charitable fundraiser

19

could in advance draw a line and say, I don't have to

20

disclose anything under risk of being prosecuted.

21

suppose that any charitable fundraiser, if you win this

22

case, would say, there's only one way I can cover myself,

23

and that is to disclose the percentages when I make the --

24

the solicitation.

25

prosecution.

Otherwise, I'm vulnerable to a

If that is the way the charitable

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I would

1

fundraisers are going to be forced to operate, then, in

2

fact, we have totally undercut the precedent that says you

3

can't require that disclosure, so my question is, how can

4

we, how could we sanction a system on your theory that

5

would be fair, without, in practical terms, whether we say

6

it or not, requiring the very disclosure that we have said

7

previously need not be required?

8

MR. HUSZAGH:

I would agree that if that were

9

the conclusion as to what would occur in -- in -- if the

10

law that we advocate were permitted, then the Court would

11

effectively be forced to reevaluate the validity of its

12

precedents, and we are not --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

And maybe we should.

I'm not saying

one way or the other there, but -MR. HUSZAGH:

But in this case we are not urging

16

the Court to do so, but it is our -- our premise that

17

the -- that that conclusion does not necessarily follow,

18

and it has not been established in this case.

19

Ultimately, these speakers know how much is

20

going to be used for various purposes, or they certainly

21

have the ability to know that, and they are the masters of

22

their own speech, and to suggest that they have no ability

23

to know what the public is going to believe, or be led to

24

believe when they make specific representations about

25

seeking money for charity I think is somewhat unrealistic.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Okay, let's assume that it's

2

unrealistic in this particular case. 85/15, okay, let's

3

assume you win.

4

that we've got to worry about.

5

65/35, 60/40, 55/45 -- it's those cases

MR. HUSZAGH:

But I think that the -- the

6

question then becomes whether the Court should displace

7

common law fraud principles, which already provide a

8

measure of breathing room for that type of uncertainty.

9

Ultimately --

10

QUESTION:

I suppose the breathing room is that

11

there has to be a false statement, a misrepresentation,

12

let's assume with knowledge of its falsity, which is

13

relied upon by the -- by the listener, that there's

14

some -- has to be damage and so forth.

15

you -- what do you tell the jury, what a reasonable person

16

would believe?

17

MR. HUSZAGH:

No.

Is that what

It is important for the jury

18

to decide what, in fact, the donating public did believe

19

as to how much was going to be used for the purposes

20

described, that this is not some normative imposition by

21

the Government as to what's reasonable.

22

adjudicatory process to determine what the understanding

23

of the public was, and ultimately --

24
25

QUESTION:

This is an

What would the instruction, though,

to the jury be under the Illinois law?

What must the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

State prove here?
MR. HUSZAGH:

2

The State would have to prove that

3

there were a material misrepresentation of fact, leaving

4

aside for a moment the intent requirement.

5

misrepresentation of fact includes three elements which

6

provide the defendant with a breathing space for some of

7

the uncertainties that the Court seems to be sensitive to.

8

First, the assertion must be factual, not some type of

9

representation like, this charity is a humdinger that

10
11

The material

can't be disproved in a court of law.
The interpretation, the meaning to that statement has

12

to be a reasonable one, which is an objective requirement

13

subject to supervision by the courts, so if somebody

14

believed that 150 percent of every donation was going to

15

go to charity, that is objectively unreasonable, and the

16

Court would eliminate that.
QUESTION:

17

Well, what -- what you say would be

18

very impressive and would eliminate my problems if you

19

were willing to go further and say, whenever you say, I'm

20

raising money for Vietnamese orphans, oh, 100 percent of

21

the money you collect is understood by the public to be

22

going to Vietnamese orphans, but you're not willing to say

23

that.

24

MR. HUSZAGH:

25

It's not reasonable --

No, because that's not reasonable.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

QUESTION:

2

MR. HUSZAGH:

Because that's not reasonable.
It's not reasonable for the public

to assume --

MR. HUSZAGH:

So -- so the --

So it has a reasonable understanding.

8

QUESTION:

-- what does -- what does the judge

instruct the jury?

25 percent.
The -- there is no --

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if

10

you think it's reasonable to send -- or -- or what?

11

no, it wouldn't be whether it's reasonable.

12

think the average person would have thought, right?

13

MR. HUSZAGH:

No,

It's what you

It's what the Government proves

14

that the donating public understood based upon what they

15

were told, what they were reasonably led to believe.

16

may include their background assumptions about how much

17

normally goes to fundraising costs or other administrative

18

overhead, and that can depend upon the nature of the

19

charity, as well as the statements made by the defendants.

20

That

The other elements, to finish my answer to

21

Justice O'Connor's and Justice Kennedy's questions, is

22

that there is in addition a materiality requirement.

23

is not enough that the statement be technically false,

24

like a difference between 95 percent and 93 percent.

25

difference has to be material, and that again provides

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

It

The

1

that certain falsity will go unprohibited because the

2

materiality requirement already gives a buffer zone.

3

QUESTION:

Look at all -- think of all of the --

4

of the green, dark green briefs.

Those briefs are filled

5

with examples of instances where the telemarketer kept a

6

large, maybe 90, maybe 100 percent, which seem perfectly

7

legitimate.

8

the beginning they have to keep up more, keep more.

9

example, it's an educational campaign, and what the

For example, it's a start-up campaign, and at
For

10

charity thinks is, we want to spend this money so people

11

will have heard our name, or will examine themselves for

12

possible breast cancer, or whatever.

13

Or, it could even be the Nature Conservancy,

14

where for accounting reasons the money that's going to

15

purchase land is not treated as if it were an expense on

16

behalf of the charity, so they're filled with examples.

17

MR. HUSZAGH:

Well --

18

Now, suppose in your case the defendant proved

19

that he was within one of those examples.

Would you then

20

say, if the jury believes that, that you should win, or

21

the defendant, and the reason I ask is that I think most

22

people feel, and the relevance of your case is that the

23

money is going to help the charity, indeed, most of it,

24

and what they will have shown is that the money did go to

25

help the charity, but in this instance, helping the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

charity was consistent with the telemarketer keeping a

2

very large percentage, so could you explain how, in your

3

view, the law works with all those examples in the dark

4

green briefs?

5

MR. HUSZAGH:

I -- I think there are two basic

6

answers to your question, Justice Breyer, and one is that

7

the reasonableness of the manner in which the expenditures

8

are made is not a proper subject of the Government's

9

paternalistic bureaucratic oversight to second-guess that

10

judgment, and I think the Court made that clear both in

11

Munson and more specifically in Riley, and we are not

12

arguing that the -- whether the -- the plaintiff's fraud

13

claim for actual specific misrepresentations turns -- they

14

will win or lose, depending upon whether there is some

15

reasonableness element to the manner of the

16

expenditures --

17

QUESTION:

No, well, if you're saying that they

18

lose, the telemarketer, even if all the money is being

19

used to help the charity, then I agree with the thrust of

20

the questions that have gone before.

21

MR. HUSZAGH:

22

QUESTION:

23

Well --

I don't see how you can possibly

prosecute people for fraud where there is no fraud --

24

MR. HUSZAGH:

25

QUESTION:

But that leads to --

-- and -- and that would seem to me a

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

case where there is no fraud.
MR. HUSZAGH:

2
3

That leads to the second point

that I was going to make.
QUESTION:

4

And it's a charity, too, so there's a

5

First Amendment right.

6

MR. HUSZAGH:

7

QUESTION:

And I don't dispute that, but --

Why -- why is there no fraud, just

8

because the charge is reasonable?

Fraud exists if you

9

have represented to the public something, whether the

10

something you've represented is reasonable or unreasonable

11

or not.

12

perfectly reasonable charge for this kind of fundraising,

13

and the public therefore believes, given what you've said,

14

I'm raising money for Vietnamese orphans, that at least

15

50 percent of that is going to go to Vietnam, then it

16

seems to me you have a fraud case.

17
18
19

If the public is unaware that 95 percent is a

MR. HUSZAGH:

That is my answer to the second

part of Justice Breyer's question.
QUESTION:

All right.

In other words, you

20

intend to convict people -- you intend to convict them,

21

and this may be one of them.

22

Nature Conservancy because 98 percent of its revenue is --

23

is accounted for as -- as telemarketing expense, where in

24

reality, they're buying land with that.

25

MR. HUSZAGH:

You intend to convict the

No, I --

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Or you intend to convict the -- the

2

organization that is simply trying to inform women about

3

the importance of self-examination for cancer.

4

the answer?

5

MR. HUSZAGH:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

Is that

No, it is not.

Okay, then -- then why don't you

elaborate on your answer.
MR. HUSZAGH:
Conservancy first.

Let me deal with the Nature

I think that's an example in which the

10

public who gives money to the Nature Conservancy

11

understands realistically that their money is going to be

12

used for the purpose of buying land, and to suggest in

13

some artificial sense by a prosecutor that no, really they

14

thought it was going to be used in an accounting format to

15

be treated as -- as an expense as opposed to a capital

16

acquisition establishes fraud is -- is simply unrealistic.

17

The other example again focuses upon the

18

specific nature of the representation made, and there --

19

there is a wide variety of differences, but if the

20

representation is made that the money is going to be used

21

to feed hungry orphans in Vietnam, it does not somehow

22

become, per se, nonfraudulent if, in fact, those funds are

23

being used to -- to get out the word about the plight of

24

Vietnam veterans, which is different, and materially

25

different from what the representation was to the donors.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I think that is our basic -QUESTION:

2

Counsel, let me ask you this.

Is --

3

is the State taking the position that there is a material

4

misrepresentation of fact here because the amount given to

5

the charity was a trifling amount?
MR. HUSZAGH:

6
7

trifling amount -QUESTION:

8
9

It -- yes, because it was a

Is that -- is that how you bill the

material misrepresentation?
MR. HUSZAGH:

10

Well, materiality doesn't always

11

have to rise to the level that there will only be a

12

trifling amount that would go to the charity, but there

13

was a significant --

14

QUESTION:

But in this case?

15

MR. HUSZAGH:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

says, well, the Governor had a charity ball, and just

18

17 percent --

19

MR. HUSZAGH:

QUESTION:

MR. HUSZAGH:

Well, I -- I don't --

-- was kept and no prosecution.
I'd rather not use my time to try

and explain the misleading --

QUESTION:

MR. HUSZAGH:

25

Uh-huh.
-- impression given by that

example.

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Let me just say that the facts of that case are

2

dramatically different than were represented, and the --

3

the argument that there has been any impermissible

4

selective prosecution in this case based upon some type of

5

discriminatory element that would violate the Equal

6

Protection Clause, there's nothing in the record to that.

7

If there were such a case, the Court has said that there

8

is a reserved ability to do so.
QUESTION:

9
10

Do you want to reserve the balance of

my time, Mr. Huszagh?
MR. HUSZAGH:

What I would --

Yes, I would.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

17
18

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the

19
20

Government's authority to protect the public from fraud,

21

even though virtually every representation involves

22

speech.

23

Indeed, while striking down broad prophylactic

24

laws, every time this Court has addressed the issue of

25

charitable solicitation, it has reaffirmed the

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional viability of individual fraud actions.

2

Now, part of the reason that this Court has

3

distinguished between individual fraud actions and broad

4

prophylactic rules is that an individual fraud action can

5

bring into bear the entire context of a misrepresentation.

6

The difficulty with a statute like that before the Court

7

in Riley was that it necessarily focused on a single

8

factor, fundraising costs, and didn't take into account

9

what was told to individual donors or anything else, and

10
11

then categorically -QUESTION:

But isn't that essentially,

12

Mr. Clement, what is happening here?

13

are -- to the extent that these are telephone calls, and

14

say, like you to contribute to Vietnam, and this money's

15

going to be spent on veterans, and that's the extent of

16

it, it seems that the Illinois Attorney General is

17

measuring the decision whether to bring a fraud claim by

18

the percent that goes to the charity in comparison to

19

this -- this portion that goes to the fundraiser.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

That is, these

I think that the fundraising costs

21

are part of the analysis of the fraud action, but I

22

wouldn't have read Riley as making that factor wholly

23

immaterial, and I think the important thing is that in the

24

calls in this case, they weren't just saying, we're here

25

to raise money for Vietnam vets.

The record suggests that

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there was an emphasis on particular charitable services.

2

We're raising money for food baskets.

3

to help veterans here in DuPage County.
QUESTION:

4

We're raising money

Well, that's fine.

I mean, those

5

specific misrepresentations that turned out to be false,

6

and some of them said 90 percent is going to go there,

7

those are no problems.

8

the -- the fraud allegations that are sustained simply on

9

the basis of the fact this money is going to go to this

The ones we're concerned with are

10

cause and, in fact, only 15 percent of it is going to that

11

cause.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two responses, Your Honor.

13

First of all, since there are these specific

14

misrepresentations in this case, that alone is a reason to

15

reverse the decision, because the Illinois Supreme Court

16

seemed to be laboring under the misimpression that those

17

cases were wholly off-limits because the fundraising

18

percentage --

19
20

QUESTION:

We do have to write an opinion

though, you know.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

Okay.
So let me bring you to the second

24

part of the question, which is, I think there are problems

25

when you have a situation where the only thing that is

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

said is, we're here to raise money for charity, but I

2

think in reality, you have to give -- you have to trust

3

juries in common law fraud actions a little bit to take

4

into account the broad nature of the representations that

5

are made.

6

to a broad prophylactic rule is that a fraud action can

7

take into account the entire mosaic of the representations

8

that are made, and there's no need to focus on one

9

particular tile and see whether it's literally true or

10
11

The -- the virtue of a fraud action as opposed

literally false.
QUESTION:

Would you be able to show to the jury

12

how reasonable it is for this particular fundraiser to --

13

to retain 85 percent?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I -- I think so.

Why?
If every --

Why?

What does that have to do with

what the effect of the representation was upon the public?
MR. CLEMENT:

Because there are other elements

20

of a common law fraud action.

21

materiality, and reasonable reliance.

22

person raised --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You also have to show
If every single

How does that go to materiality?

How does it go to reasonable reliance?
MR. CLEMENT:

Because if every single person

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

raising money has had these astronomical fundraising

2

costs, which of course is not true, but if that were true,

3

then a -- an individual donor who recognized that might

4

well not have any reasonable reliance on the

5

representations that money is going to charity, because

6

no -- no charity, apparently, can get any money to the

7

actual services that money is being raised, but that's not

8

true.
A very important element of common law fraud

9
10

that I think can provide sufficient protection to

11

legitimate charities is the intent to deceive, and the

12

intent to deceive I think is going to make a big

13

difference, because if you have a legitimate charity

14

that's asked by a donor what percentage of the money goes

15

to the specific service that you're raising money for,

16

let's say, food baskets, and that charity responds and

17

provides forthcoming information, then I don't see how the

18

prosecution or plaintiff can ever show an intent to

19

deceive.

20

On the other hand --

21

QUESTION:

Okay, but let's take -- let's take

22

the cases, leaving aside the specific misrepresentations

23

here, let's take the case that we've got.

24

going.

25

a -- a jury could infer that there was an intent to

15 percent is

I take it you believe that on the basis of that,

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

deceive, from the silence?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

I -- I would say --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

Okay.
-- that part of the evidence I'd

like to put before the jury on intent to deceive --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

I -- I think that's right, but

May I ask --- is when a donor asks that

question --

10

QUESTION:

But the donor --

11

QUESTION:

This is not a jury trial, is it?

12

Isn't this an equity proceeding?

13

about the jury all the way through, but I think it's a --

14
15

QUESTION:

A fraud action for damages is a

QUESTION:

I thought it was a proceeding in --

jury --

16
17

Everybody's talking

before -- in Chancery in this case.
MR. CLEMENT:

18

I'm reliably informed that this

19

particular proceeding would go as a bench trial, which I

20

think would provide even further protection for free

21

speech.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that -- my answer is in

24

terms of the jury because I do think that the -- the

25

decision that this Court announces is going to affect jury

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

trials as well, but what I'm saying is, I'd like to get

2

before the jury the fact that when these particular

3

fundraisers were asked the question, well, where does the

4

money go, at least the record suggests that they flatly

5

misrepresented where the money --

6

QUESTION:

You -- you bet, and that's -- that's

7

what you've got in this case, but as Justice Scalia said,

8

we've got to write the opinion, and -- and if we consider

9

the case in which there were not these quite specific

10

misrepresentations, all you've got is silence about the

11

percentage, and a statement that the object of the charity

12

is Vietnamese orphans or whatever it may be, it seems to

13

me that when you start getting below the 85/25, you get

14

into an area in which the -- the result is a dice throw,

15

and if that is the case, the only way the charitable

16

fundraiser can protect himself, with the greatest good

17

faith in the world, is to disclose the percentage, and if

18

that's what we are going to require in fact, then we

19

better face the fact that we're going to have to retreat

20

from -- from what we've already held.

21

What's your answer to that?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I would say first that we

23

wouldn't have any objection if you wanted to retreat from

24

what you said in Riley.

25

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

You wouldn't mind.
But -- but --

But isn't that what -- that's what

we've got to do, isn't it?
MR. CLEMENT:

No, that is not what you have to

6

do, and I think the important thing is the type of hypo of

7

just all they do is call up and say, I'm here to raise

8

money for charity, what that hypothetical tends to do is

9

force the analysis into the single variable analysis

10

that's reflected in broad prophylactic rules, and the

11

answer in these cases, and I think what the opinion should

12

suggest, is that the context does matter terribly, so to

13

take some of the questions --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay --- that concern Justice Breyer, if

16

I could, when he's worried about the start-up charity,

17

well, if a start-up charity says, hi, we're a start-up

18

charity, but we are trying to raise money for a new cause,

19

and here's what we hope to do with the money, that's very

20

different than if a start-up charity picks up the phone

21

and says, we're a start-up charity, and we're going -- if

22

you give us money, we're going to help this particular

23

child in this foreign country.

24

I mean, if a start-up charity avoids fraudulent

25

statements, then that's going to have a reasonable effect

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

on the mind of the donor, and the donor's going to

2

recognize that, okay, a) start-up charities may have

3

higher cost, but more importantly, the representation that

4

I received was not that you were going to provide food

5

baskets in DuPage County, but that you hoped to provide

6

special services that weren't being provided currently by

7

any extant charity, and I think that context can make all

8

the difference.

9

And there are many elements of common law fraud

10

actions.

11

deceive, materiality, and reasonable reliance.

12

Illinois, as is typical, you have to show those factors by

13

clear and convincing evidence.

14

provide substantial breathing room for First Amendment

15

values.

16

You have to show knowledge of falsity, intent to
In

All of that is going to

Indeed, much of this Court's jurisprudence in

17

the libel and defamation area has been a process of taking

18

the requirements of the common law for fraud, which were

19

much more onerous, and superimposing them on the law of

20

libel and defamation, where things like falsity was

21

presumed, and damages could be presumed, upon a showing of

22

defamation, and I think if you put it in that context,

23

that all of the safeguards that this Court has carefully

24

constructed over the years in the libel and defamation

25

context are in place to protect the -- the First Amendment

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rights and provide breathing room, then I think that the

2

idea that the sky is falling is really mistaken in these

3

cases.

4

And I think to the contrary, if this Court were

5

to suggest in a case where the reality is that not just

6

85 percent is going to the professional fundraiser, but

7

fully 97 percent is going to something other than program

8

services, because VietNow only spends 20 percent of the

9

money they receive on program services, if this were --

10

Court were to suggest in this case that there's not a

11

fraud action, then it really will be open season for

12

charitable solicitation fraud.

13

And I think this Court has been particularly

14

concerned about broad prophylactic rules in the First

15

Amendment area.

16

critically in its prior restraint doctrine, and that --

17

that instinct is reflected in Schaumburg, Munson, and

18

Riley, but at the same time, there's a corollary

19

principle, which specific instances of fraud can be

20

prosecuted by the Government, and that instinct is also

21

reflected in Munson, Schaumburg, and Riley, and there's

22

simply nothing in the First Amendment that suggests that

23

charitable solicitation fraud need go unpunished, and with

24

respect, I think what the Illinois Supreme Court did here

25

in creating a broad prophylactic immunity for charitable

This is reflected in -- in, most

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

solicitation from the law of fraud is just as unjustified

2

as the broad prophylactic rules limiting charitable

3

solicitation that this Court struck down in Schaumburg,

4

Munson, and Riley.

5

If there are no further questions --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. ERROL COPILEVITZ

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COPILEVITZ:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, members of

the Court:
What charities spend or pay for fundraising,

12
13

whether based upon a percentage or otherwise, are a

14

measure of the charity's judgment about how much to invest

15

in persuasion, a fully protected activity and it cannot be

16

second-guessed.

17

of unpopular organizations to zealously pursue their

18

causes.

19

The First Amendment guarantees the right

The petitioner comes to this Court having pled

20

one case, but having argued another case.

The

21

petitioner's denial of any intent to impose a cost

22

limitation on charitable appeals, and the petitioner's

23

claim that its only purpose is to combat fraud, is simply

24

not supported in this record.

25

petitioner's claim is focused exclusively on the amount of

What is clear is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

the respondents' fee.
QUESTION:

Well now, I don't read the record

3

quite that way, Mr. Copilevitz.

4

mentioned earlier on page 169, where the -- the woman said

5

that she specifically asked the question and was told

6

90 percent or more goes to the vets, that strikes me as a

7

straight common law fraud action.

8

that -- that the State is prohibited by the First

9

Amendment from prosecuting that case?

10

MR. COPILEVITZ:

The affidavit that I

Are you saying that

No, I'm not, Your Honor.

What

11

I'm saying is that if that violation had been pled in this

12

case, we would have a different result at the Illinois

13

Supreme Court.

14

is the paragraph that incorporates these affidavits, and

15

the allegation is simply that if the fee of the fundraiser

16

had been disclosed, they would not have made

17

contributions.

Paragraph 74, at page 104 of the appendix,

18

The Illinois Supreme Court specifically found,

19

as did the Illinois appellate court and the trial court,

20

that there were no affirmative misstatements made.

21

order for the petitioner's case to be sustained, it has to

22

have two legs.

23

indication of fraud, so it has to have some other positive

24

statement.

25

In

We know that cost alone is not an

QUESTION:

Well, what if --

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Why -- why is it that if -- if we

2

assume that the donors would not have given the money had

3

this statement been made, that that is not a large part of

4

showing a misrepresentation, I mean, I assume people

5

wouldn't buy automobiles or toasters if they knew that the

6

manufacturer was getting 95 percent of -- of the cost and

7

there was -- only 5 percent went into raw materials, so

8

there's always some problems here, but let's suppose that

9

95 percent, 100 percent of the donors would not have given

10

the money if they had known the facts.

11

beginnings, at least, of a misrepresentation?

12

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Isn't that the

Well, you're dealing with the

13

lesser of two evils.

14

are a lesser evil than compelling a point of solicitation

15

disclosure of information that is inaccurate, that this

16

Court has held is not material, and risk creating for

17

smaller --

18

QUESTION:

High undisclosed fundraising costs

Well, why isn't it material if -- if

19

the money would not have been given had the -- had the

20

fact been disclosed?

21

MR. COPILEVITZ:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

The percentage doesn't --

That doesn't -- isn't that another

way of saying the person is acting under a misimpression?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

No, because the whole concept

is built on the only return the nonprofit received is the

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

net dollars, and as this Court recognized in Riley, there

2

is a wide range of values that the organization receives

3

from the appeal itself.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Copilevitz, it seems to me you

5

have to respond to Justice Kennedy, no, that it doesn't

6

constitute fraud simply to refuse to tell somebody

7

something which, if he knew, he would not have made the

8

contribution.

9

the contribution if they knew what an inefficient charity

10

this particular charity was, or knew that, you know, for

11

the past several years there had been a lot of

12

organizational problems.

13

with all this upon pain of being guilty of fraud?

I mean, perhaps someone would not have made

14

MR. COPILEVITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Does the person have to come out

No.

Certainly you don't have to tell

16

someone everything which, if he knew, would make a

17

difference.

That doesn't constitute fraud.

18

MR. COPILEVITZ:

19

QUESTION:

I agree.

But if you ask a question and you

20

give a false answer, the two examples were given -- I was

21

struck by another -- one of the affidavits' comments.

22

This is the one at joint appendix 1 -- 182.

23

says it's tax deductible, and now the donor asks, on being

24

told that only 20 percent went to the charity, is it?

25

MR. COPILEVITZ:

The receipt

Is it tax deductible?

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

Yes.

1
2

QUESTION:

Is the 100 percent tax deductible

when 80 percent goes to the fundraiser?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

3

That presume -- the answer to

4

your question is yes.

The organization receives a benefit

5

beyond the net dollars.

6

and if you look at the appendix, Article 5 of the articles

7

of incorporation at joint appendix 16 says that one of the

8

primary purposes of this organization is to increase the

9

community awareness of the problems faced by Vietnam

The purpose of the organization,

10

veterans.

11

Vietnam veterans incorporated a part of that.

12

incorporated a magazine.

13

It incorporated distributing information.

14

The contract that my client had with the
It

It incorporated an 800 number.

The difference between the 15 cents on the

15

dollar that was received and the fee is value that this

16

organization received, so certainly the entire amount of

17

any contribution is tax deductible, and it's not fair or

18

proper to say that the organization received no benefit

19

other than the dollars.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask a question that's not

21

entirely hypothetical?

Suppose Congress, trying to get a

22

handle on fundraising operations that are really operating

23

to line the pockets of the fundraiser, rather than for the

24

benefit of the charity, would say, if more than 40 percent

25

of what is collected goes to the fundraiser, then the

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

donor will get a tax deduction only for the amount that

2

actually goes to the charity.

3

In other words, taking your theory, up to

4

40 percent, but saying if the fundraiser gets more than

5

40 percent, then the donor will not get a deduction for

6

everything the donor gave, but only for the part that went

7

to the charity, would that be -- would that violate the

8

First Amendment?

9

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Yes.

An organization like

10

Mothers Against Drunk Driving exists to advocate a change

11

of attitude.

12

says, every cent you raise I am giving to you to call that

13

many more people in order to -- to deliver our message, in

14

which case they would have 100 percent cost of fundraising

15

under the approach of the petitioner in this case, and

16

they would be justified, and your gifts to that

17

organization would be fully deductible, as they should be,

18

and they have the First Amendment right to spend what they

19

believe --

20

They could well enter into a contract that

QUESTION:

I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't -- that may

21

be the purpose of the organization, so that's for the

22

charitable purpose, to spread the word about drunk

23

driving, but the example that I gave you is, the

24

fundraiser says, you're not a very appealing charity.

25

you want us to raise money for you, we're going to charge

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

If

1

a great deal, and you get -- you'll get something, where

2

if you were doing it on your own, you'd get nothing.

3

that kind of case, not the example of MADD, where the word

4

about drunk driving is being spread, but just, the

5

economics of it is that the fundraiser takes 80 percent.

6

MR. COPILEVITZ:

You presume that the contract

7

is made at arm's length in the marketplace.

8

charities have the same right to have their message

9

circulated as does a popular organization.

10

QUESTION:

In

Unpopular

Well, I -- I presume that just as

11

some charities pay too much for fundraisers, some of them

12

may pay too much for their corporate offices.

13

enter into exorbitant leases that they could have gotten

14

for half of that had they been better negotiators.

15

we wouldn't reduce the tax deduction because some of those

16

expenses were unreasonable.

17

the way the tax deduction works.

18

the charity, it's an expense of the charity.

19

MR. COPILEVITZ:

They may

Surely

It seems to me that's simply
If it's an expense of

And the charity may have all

20

manners of expense that may be relevant to one donor but

21

not be relevant to another.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Copilevitz, a moment ago you said

23

that in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois there

24

was a statement that the defendants had made no

25

affirmative representation.

I had not read the opinion

3

telling us on what page of the petition for writ of

4

certiorari that -- that statement appears?

5

Could you either locate it during your

It appears in page 348 of the

provided by the defendants, and there is no allegation

9

that defendants made affirmative misstatements to

QUESTION:

What about the allegation in

12

paragraph 63, from 1987 through the present, in conducting

13

their charitable solicitations, the donors made

14

representations which induced the donors to contribute

15

funds for charitable purposes by representing that the

16

funds they contributed would go to charitable purposes.

17

Now, that doesn't say what the particular representations

18

were, but they had a lot of affidavits attached which did.

23

MR. COPILEVITZ:
inherently

unreliable.

QUESTION:

But the affidavits were

They're -- the --

No, no, I'm saying, in terms of

whether there is an allegation in the complaint.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

It's not -- those -- those

24

affidavits are incorporated for the sole purpose of

25

demonstrating that there was not a disclosure of the fee

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

paid.

If those affidavits were true and correct, each one

2

of them would have supported an independent action in

3

violation of a specific statute in the Illinois Charitable

4

Association Act --

5

QUESTION:

I'm not understanding.

6

QUESTION:

No.

7

QUESTION:

I thought that the question is simply

8

whether they've alleged that there were specific

9

affirmative representations, and the status, I gather from

10

the SG's brief and what I've just read, is that they

11

allege there were representations, and then they attached

12

affidavits which have in them, and there's a footnote in

13

the SG's brief that list the affidavits, statements as to

14

particular affirmative representations, and -- and

15

therefore, I want to know is that, if that issue isn't in

16

the case, fine, but -- but I'm somewhat puzzled as to why

17

it isn't.

18

MR. COPILEVITZ:

It's not in the case.

There

19

are no allegations -- those would have constituted

20

violations of specific sections of the statute.

21

QUESTION:

But --

22

MR. COPILEVITZ:

There was no allegation in the

23

complaint.

The only place they're found are in the

24

affidavits which are incorporated as a reference that the

25

fee was not disclosed and, had it been, they would not

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have given it.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but the --

3

MR. COPILEVITZ:

4

QUESTION:

That's the sole purpose of it.

The Supreme Court of Illinois didn't

5

go off on the ground that there was a separate statute

6

regulating solicitation, and that therefore you couldn't

7

have a common law fraud action in Illinois.

8

MR. COPILEVITZ:

9

Chief Justice's question.
QUESTION:

10

I'm not sure I understand the

Well, I -- I thought you were

11

suggesting that these allegations would have been a -- a

12

violation of a specific statute governing fraud, governing

13

charitable solicitation, but the Supreme Court of Illinois

14

didn't say that because there's a statute governing

15

solicitation you could not bring a common law fraud action

16

in this case.

17

prohibits you from doing it, as I understood their

18

opinion.

19

What they said was that the First Amendment

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Yes, sir.

What they said is

20

that the only allegation was that the fees were excessive

21

and they weren't disclosed, that there was no allegation

22

of any affirmative misrepresentation.

23

that an action couldn't be brought for fraud if there was

24

an affirmative misrepresentation.

QUESTION:

They did not say

This is -- this case -- something you

said I thought was not quite right.

This case went off on

a motion to dismiss, so there was no trial.

5

findings of anything and, given the liberality of

6

complaint amendments, even if you're right that they

didn't make those allegations, they surely could, so one

thing is to say, I thought your position was, no matter

9

what they said in the complaint, this kind of operation

There was no

must be allowed to go on, not simply that they -- they --

11

there's a defect in pleadings here, but no claim could be

12

stated, not that these -- these pleadings didn't state a

13

claim.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

14

Well, maybe I'm not clear,

What I am saying, that high fund-raising costs

15

alone, and the failure to disclose those costs, consistent

17

with Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, are not an indication

18

of fraud in and of themselves.

19

to stand on.

20

The State needed two legs

They might have had the high fundraising costs,

21

but they needed some form of misrepresentation connected

22

with the use of the money, and what the Illinois Supreme

23

Court found, what the appellate court found, and what the

24

trial court found on the motion to dismiss, that the

25

second leg did not exist, and therefore, the claim could

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not stand, because to do so would have been contrary to

2

this Court's holdings --

3

QUESTION:

And --

4

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't --

5

QUESTION:

And supporting your, what you're

6

saying, the question presented gives us the naked question

7

if the 85 percent is enough.

8

the question presented that talks about these fringe

9

issues.

There -- there's nothing in

You're -- you're dead right on that.

10

MR. COPILEVITZ:

11

QUESTION:

Thank you.

Well, why can't -- why -- why isn't

12

it appropriate for us to say that the affidavits can

13

function for First Amendment purposes like a bill of

14

particulars, and that the Illinois Supreme Court ought to

15

consider that, and if, under Illinois practice, they could

16

function as a bill of particulars, then there's nothing in

17

our First Amendment jurisprudence that prohibits the

18

prosecution.

19

That leaves open the broader question, but in

20

this particular case, why wouldn't that at least be an

21

appropriate response for this Court to make with respect

22

to the affidavits?

23

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Those violations of the statute

24

are certainly subject to prosecution.

That's not the case

25

that was brought by the State of Illinois.

They amended

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the complaint two times.
QUESTION:

2

No, I realize that that's not the way

3

it was originally brought.

4

appropriate for us to say, if -- if we otherwise believe

5

it, that the affidavits can function consistently with the

6

First Amendment, consistently with our First Amendment

7

cases as a bill of particulars --

8

MR. COPILEVITZ:

9

QUESTION:

10

All I'm saying is, isn't it

The --

-- and -- and when you get to that

particular level, it's okay to prosecute?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

11

The Illinois Supreme Court

12

found as a matter of law that those affidavits were not

13

part of the complaint, and this Court certainly has the

14

authority to -QUESTION:

15

procedure you can't do that, is what you're saying.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

So just as a matter of State

too?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

It's the quote that I just

read, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Could you give me --

1

QUESTION:

It's all there, isn't it?

3

petition -- the petition for writ of certiorari.

4

can't find it now, file it with -- file it with the Clerk

5

later.

6

MR. COPILEVITZ:

7

QUESTION:

If you

Yes, sir.

Could I ask you, taking it just as

8

you want to present it, fine, and I think -- I'm -- I'm

9

convinced that there are a lot of instances in which

10

somebody keeping 85 percent of the money would be

11

perfectly consistent with a charitable purpose, but there

12

may also be quite a lot of instances where keeping

13

85 percent of the money serves no charitable purpose, and

14

really, it isn't much of a charity, and there the public

15

is deceived.

16

Now, is there anything wrong with prosecuting

17

that kind of charity, and if it turns out to be the first

18

instead of the second, you could raise the claim later,

19

after the prosecution, or during the trial, that we don't

20

know what'll happen in such a circumstance?

21

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well, my reservation in

22

answering the question yes is, again, you are focused

23

simply on the value of the net dollars that are received.

24
25

QUESTION:
exactly my question.

That -- that's correct.

That's

I understand that there are

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances where that fact, that virtually all the

2

money goes to the telemarketer and little to the charity,

3

is absolutely justified in terms of charitable purpose,

4

but my question, which I'm repeating, is, there may be

5

many, many, many instances where it isn't, and so what's

6

wrong with prosecuting those people for fraud?

7

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well, I would -- I would refer

8

to the decision of Judge Posner in the UCC case, where we

9

had virtually that very set of facts, and the Solicitor

10

for the Internal Revenue Service proposed that, in dealing

11

with how would we know, the notice issue and the standard,

12

is there would be a case-by-case analysis, and it would

13

evolve, and Judge Posner, I believe correctly determined

14

that that's no standard at all, and if there's no

15

standard, we're back to the lesser evil.
QUESTION:

16

Oh, no, there's a perfectly good

17

standard, that if you're going to keep 85 percent of the

18

money, you better have documents showing that you're doing

19

it for a good, charitable reason, that's all, and the

20

people who will be prosecuted are the people that can't

21

show that.

Now --

22

MR. COPILEVITZ:

23

QUESTION:

Well --

Now, I'm not saying that's a

24

constitutional standard.

25

standard.

I'm not saying it's a State law

I don't know what standard it would be.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I want

1

to get your answer.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

2

I don't believe that you can

3

measure the worth of an organization based upon its

4

financial efficiency.
QUESTION:

5

Would -- would you say that the State

6

of Illinois or any State could require charities every 6

7

months to report the percentage of money going to

8

telemarketers and the percentage going to the ultimate

9

beneficiaries in -- in direct payments and file this every

10
11
12
13

6 months?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

Yes, sir, and there are some

States that do require that.
QUESTION:

I assume that the State Attorney

14

General or the State Secretary of State can, indeed, close

15

down charities which are being used as -- as private

16

money-making ventures.

17

that possible?

but through investigating the books of the charity.

MR. COPILEVITZ:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and under section --

The thing I don't understand, though,

24

is the difference between good charities and bad charities

25

doesn't seem to me to have a particle to do with the

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

question of whether the State was a -- was a

2

misrepresentation or not.

3

good charity, and 85 percent from a bad charity and keep

4

it, but the statement to the public is equally misleading

in either case.

maybe it is.

Well --

I don't see how the character of the

charity has any bearing on the -- on the kind of -whether there's fraud or not.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

I would agree, and I would

12

point to the petitioner's reply brief at the footnote

13

referring to the brief that was filed by Disabled American

14

Veterans, explaining the problem of donor acquisition

15

mailings, that it can cost $1 or more to acquire $1, and

16

that that should be something that the petitioner should

17

give deference to, and in footnote 13 of the petitioner's

18

reply, they took exactly the opposite position and said

19

the fact that it was donor acquisition mailings, trying to

20

acquire new donors, was not a reason to set aside the

21

principles that they've enunciated in their complaint.

22

QUESTION:

Let make -- let's make an assumption

23

that 95 percent of the donors in the case of your client's

24

charity would not have given the money had they known of

25

the amount being kept by the telemarketers.

Is there

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

anything the State can do to protect the people of -- of

2

the State from having -- from parting with their money

3

under those circumstances?
MR. COPILEVITZ:

4

Yes, sir.

The State of

5

Illinois has a series of -- of disclosure requirements.

6

They're content-based, neutral disclosures.

7

before you ask for a donation in Illinois, if you're a

8

compensated professional fundraiser, disclose your

9

professional status.

You must,

You must also disclose that you can obtain

Office of the Attorney General.
You must also answer, if asked, what your fee

is.

You must disclose it.
You must disclose, if asked, what portion of the

You must disclose the primary purpose of, the

It seems that, then, the

wouldn't have given the money and, as Justice Kennedy

clarifications in the record.

to the affidavits, but our allegations stand on their own

joint appendix page 9, paragraph 34, says that the effect

11

of representations that were made was that people were

12

told that a significant amount of each dollar donated

13

would be paid over to VietNow, and the defendants knew

14

that was false because 15 cents or less of each dollar

15

would be given to VietNow for its purposes.
The allegation is that people were told that

The fallback position of the defendants in this

case is that the Court should take the draconian step of

saying that unless there is an explicit misrepresentation

of fact, not an implied one, that there should be blanket
