ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it

12

has considerable practical importance for the continuing

13

flow of interstate commerce.

14

In 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was

15

designed to ease the burdens that State registration fees

16

impose on trucks that travel interstate.

17

accomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a

18

State's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the

19

State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.

20

To help

The question here before the Court is whether

21

that Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing

22

a fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the

23

fee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not

24

actually collect or charge it as of the controlling date.

25

QUESTION:

May I ask, did it waive the fee for

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

all carriers or just the carriers involved in this case?
MR. ROTHFELD:

2

It -- it waived the fee for all

3

carriers in the category that are involved in this case.

4

The State had in place a reciprocity policy.
QUESTION:

5
6

But did it waive the fee for all

carriers in the State?
MR. ROTHFELD:

7

I do not believe.

There is

8

actually nothing in the record, Justice Stevens, that

9

indicates how many States paid fees -- how many trucks

10

paid fees and how many did not.

It's my -- our

11

understanding that there were trucks that were not

12

benefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they

13

would have paid fees.

14

answer, although not reflected in the record, is that some

15

trucks paid fees and some did not.

So I think -- I think that the

16

QUESTION:

Thank you.

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

As I say, the question is whether

18

if there is a fee that is waived as to a category of

19

trucks in 1991, whether or not that waiver must continue

20

to remain in place currently because of the -QUESTION:

21

You -- you say as to a category of

22

trucks.

23

it be true, if you're right, that if a truck -- if a fee

24

was waived as to any truck, it should remain in place?

25

Why do you add that qualification?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Why shouldn't

Well, we think that the inquiry

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a

2

particular type treated.

3

State had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different

4

types of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white

5

trucks, and nothing for blue trucks.

6

to in -- in terms -- it says that the State's fee must

7

equal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State

8

collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.

9

what in that -- in that circumstance, what is the fee that

And for example, imagine if a

The statute refers

10

the State charged when there are these different

11

categories of trucks?

12

Well,

We think it has to be understood to mean the fee

13

that the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as

14

I say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type,

15

trucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois,

16

were not subject to fees.

17

the plain language of the statute, the same policy has to

18

apply to trucks in that category now.
QUESTION:

19
20

MR. ROTHFELD:

25

There was a change that was

announced for the 1992 registration.
QUESTION:

23
24

Now, was there some change as of 1992

in connection with the fee applicable here?

21
22

We, therefore, think that under

Yes, and I guess that isn't before

us -MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- that --

1

QUESTION:

-- in this case.

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

To elaborate on -- on Justice

3

O'Connor's question, in 1991, the 1991 registration year,

4

there is no question, and it is undisputed, that for the

5

entitlement to operate in the State in 1991, on November

6

15th, 1991, the date identified as -- as crucial in the

7

statute, trucks that were base-plated in States that had

8

reciprocity understandings with -- with Illinois did not

9

have to pay fees.

And therefore, Yellow Transportation,

10

the petitioner here, whose trucks were base-plated in --

11

in Illinois did not pay fees.
It is true, Justice O'Connor, that in -- towards

12
13

the end of 1991, prior to November 15th, the State

14

announced a change for the 1992 registration year, and

15

Yellow, being a diligent taxpayer, actually paid for 1992

16

prior to November 15th.

17

QUESTION:

What does the term base-plated mean?

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

Base-plated means that plates,

19

license plates, were issued by that State.

20

-- the title for the vehicles were in those States.

21

Those --

22
23

QUESTION:

So the State

When you say base-plated in Illinois,

then that means the title was issued in Illinois --

24

MR. ROTHFELD:

25

QUESTION:

The title --

-- and it had Illinois license plates

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

on its truck?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Either Illinois license plates or

3

plates that were issued through Illinois.

There -- this

4

goes beyond any issue that's presented here, but there is

5

a understanding between the States, the International

6

Registration Plan, and there are international

7

registration plates that can be provided by -- by any

8

State, but it's provided through a single State.

9

the license plates here for Yellow trucks, it is sort of

And so

10

undisputed, were provided by Illinois.

11

question that within the understanding of -- of the

12

Michigan scheme in 1991, the Yellow trucks were based in

13

Illinois and therefore benefitted from the reciprocity

14

policy in place in -- in Michigan.

15

QUESTION:

So there is no

Your -- your test that you propose is

16

that it's the type of truck.

17

nothing in -- in the statute or in regulatory

18

pronouncements that talk about types of trucks unless it's

19

the number of axles or something.

20

seems to me, can be applied in the generic way that

21

Michigan argues.

22

within the exemption or without the exemption.

23

It -- I take it there's

But type of truck, it

It's a type of truck because it was

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me be clear what I --

24

what I mean by that, Justice Kennedy.

I don't mean type

25

of truck in terms of the number of axles or -- or the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

weight of the truck.

I -- I mean the category -- the rule

2

that the State applied in 1991 -- the State had in place a

3

system of rules that applied, different -- as we know,

4

different fees to different types of trucks.

5

you an example.

Let me give

6

Imagine that the State had a scheme in place in

7

which it charged $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks,

8

nothing for blue trucks, as I suggested before.

What is

9

the -- what is the fee that the State applied?

You have

10

to say the fee the State applied to who and look at the

11

rule that the State would have applied in 1991.

12

means identifying the type of truck in the sense of how

13

would the rule categorize it.

14

place, we believe, the rules that governed fee levels at

15

the time.

16
17
18

And that

And Congress has frozen in

If that were not the approach one took and there
were these different -QUESTION:

May I ask, under your hypothetical,

19

would that rule have prevented the company from repainting

20

its trucks, paint the blue trucks white or the white

21

trucks red, to get in a different category, which is what

22

happened here?

23

-- one rule where the trucks were licensed to a place of

24

the home office or something like that.

25

have later repainted their trucks?

They moved from one place of registration

So could they

Or in this case, could

they 2 years later have moved -- changed the -- the rule

on -- on which -- whether it's a place of licensing or the

home office?
MR. ROTHFELD:

4

Well, if -- if the question,

5

Justice Stevens, is whether the -- the fee payer could

avoid the fee by somehow modifying its trucks -QUESTION:

No, no, no.

Whether the State could

11

It did it in one

Could it have done the same thing, say, 3 years

MR. ROTHFELD:

Our -- our understanding, Your

12

Honor, is that that -- the State could not do that.

13

think that Congress has frozen in place expressly by the

14

terms of the statute --

15

QUESTION:

Locked in permanently to 1991.

We

So

16

even if -- let's say, the reciprocity agreement persists

17

in 1991, but Michigan wants to change it in 1993 and '94.

18

It cannot.

19

agreement that it made with its sister State only for the

20

year 1991.

21
22
23

It's locked in forever to a reciprocity

Is that your reading?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes, and let me explain how we

think that applies.
First, the statute went into effect in 1994,

24

although it was enacted in 1991.

So in the intervening

25

years, the State could have done whatever -- whatever it

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

wished.
We think that Congress has frozen the fee levels

2
3

in place.

Now, whether those fee levels were established

4

by reciprocity rule or by unilateral State law or by

5

administrative fiat, it wouldn't matter.

6

place in 1991 a policy that said trucks of a certain

7

character, trucks in this instance license plated in a --

8

in Illinois, were not subject to fees.

9

demanded from those trucks.

The State had in

Fees were not

They weren't collected.

They

10

weren't charged.

11

to entitle them to operate on the State's roads as of the

12

relevant period.

13

Congress, which said the State's fee must equal the fee,

14

not to exceed $10 per vehicle --

15

Those trucks did not have to pay a fee

And that being the case, we think

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the problem I

16

have with -- with your -- your argument is how does one go

17

about identifying the category?

18

trucks, or is the category trucks subject to a reciprocity

19

agreement so that if a reciprocity agreement that used to

20

exist with Michigan were canceled, or if -- if a -- for

21

that matter, a reciprocity agreement that did -- that used

22

to not exist with New York were adopted, you come into the

23

category or go out of the category, depending upon whether

24

you have a reciprocity agreement?

25

are you urging, and why do you pick that category instead

Is the category Michigan

What category are --

1
2

of -- instead of another one?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we are picking the category

3

that we think is -- was selected by Congress because

4

Congress said the fee in place in 1991 is frozen.

5

if that --

6

QUESTION:

And so

For -- for the particular truck, or

7

for the particular State as to which there is a

8

reciprocity agreement, or with respect to any State as to

9

which there is a reciprocity agreement?

10
11

It's hard to

figure out which category they -- they were talking about.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that it's not

12

complex in practice.

13

asking the State to do is look at how it would have

14

treated a truck of this type in 1991.

15
16

QUESTION:

I think that what Congress was

That's -- that's the key word, of

this type.

MR. ROTHFELD:

18

QUESTION:

MR. ROTHFELD:

MR. ROTHFELD:

But what type?
Well, of whatever --

Owned by this company?
No, no.

Or from this State, or subject -- or

23

from a State that has -- that currently has a reciprocity

24

agreement?

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think one would consider the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rule that was in place in the State just as it did in 1991

2

and say here's a truck, this truck is base-plated in

3

Illinois.

4

is relevant under our rule, because our rule says under

5

our existing reciprocity policy, we will not impose a fee

6

on a truck that has its license plate issued by Illinois.

7

Therefore, this truck is not subject to a fee.

That is a characteristic this truck has, which

8

If such a truck comes along in 1995, after the

9

statute goes into effect -- and I should say the statute

10

here is the refreshing acronym, ISTEA, the Intermodal

11

Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.

12

statute went into effect, this same -- same truck goes

13

into the State of Michigan.

14

waive the fee to -- as to it, had this truck been there in

15

1991, those same characteristics make the State waive the

16

fee as to it now, because Congress has -- has used the

17

term the State may not charge fees that it was not

18

charging in 1991.

19

State's fee must equal the fee that the State collected or

20

charged.

When the ISTEA

It has characteristics which

Again, the precise language is the

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

22

QUESTION:

What about new vehicles?

23
24
25

What about

a vehicle purchased, say, in 1995 base-plated in Illinois?
MR. ROTHFELD:

If such a vehicle is base-plated

in Illinois, that is the characteristic that is made

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

relevant by the State's rule in place in 1991.
QUESTION:

2
3

So it's not only vehicles that

existed in 1991, it's any vehicle thereafter acquired.
So one -- one element of this is that Michigan

4
5

could not, on your reading, go over to the principal place

6

of business, which in this case is -- I take it, is Kansas

7

with no -- no reciprocity with Michigan -- could not

8

change that.

9

Is that your view?
MR. ROTHFELD:

10
11

Everything is frozen forever under ISTEA.

That -- that is our view, and we

think --

12

QUESTION:

Well that's one of your views.

13

And may -- may I ask you about the -- the answer

14

you didn't give to Justice Scalia?

15

statute isn't as clear as -- as you are arguing that it

16

is.

17

that clear, Chevron controls the answer?

18

Let's assume the

Isn't this the point at which you say, if it's not

MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that is absolutely

19

correct, Justice Souter.

And if -- it is our view that

20

the -- that the statutory language is -- is unambiguous,

21

but if we are wrong about that and if there is any

22

opportunity to find any sort of -- any wiggle room for the

23

State in the statute, there is no doubt that the statute

24

does not unambiguously require that reciprocity --

25

requires States to -- to change their reciprocity rules

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It certainly doesn't

And that being the case, Chevron deference is

circumstances, I think every member of the Court has

16

recognized that deference under Chevron principles is at

17

its height, and because I think it -- it simply cannot be

said that the statutory language is clearly inconsistent

19

with the approach taken by the agency, the agency's

20

approach must be dispositive.

And here, what the agency found, unambiguously

22

and expressly, dealing precisely with the question at

issue before the Court now, is that if States had

reciprocity policies in place in 1991, they may not amend,

25

change, rescind, modify those policies in such a way --

That was

To identify the fee that was collected or

16
17

charged or can now be collected or charged from a

18

particular truck that comes from the State, one has to

19

look at the rule that was in place then and say, what was

20

the fee that would have been applied then to this truck?

21

Under that approach, Michigan cannot now change its -- its

way of implementing reciprocity policies and therefore

charge trucks that would not have been charged at that

time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

5

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

6
7
8

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

Congress assigned responsibility for

10

implementing the single State registration system to the

11

Interstate Commerce Commission.

12

when States apply the statutory fee cap, they must

13

consider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee

14

waivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991.

15

That interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee

16

cap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were

18

The ICC determined that

The Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule,

19

on the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather

20

provision into a provision that would allow new fees.

21

The ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped

22

registration fee is equal to the fee that the State

23

actually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.

24

Congress did not set the cap at the amount that the States

25

could have charged.

If Congress had wanted to do that,

the obvious thing to have done would have been to set the

2

cap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all

3

carriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991.
QUESTION:

4

Well, isn't there at least an

5

argument that Congress could have had that in mind by the

6

distinction between charged and collected?

7

there is presumably a difference between them, then the --

8

then the reference to charge would be to a fee that was

not collected, which would get you to the point which you

said Congress could have but did not provide for by the --

11

by the flat $10.

saying is, unless I'm missing something, I don't think

Chevron argument is -- is -- perhaps takes care of your

position.

17

MR. SCHLICK:

Certainly the Chevron argument is

natural reading of charge or -- of collected or charged,

20

though, is charged, demanded, collected, received.

21

QUESTION:

We think that the most

Even though that was not the

22

commission's first view.

The commission's first view of

this case is that the States would not be bound by the

reciprocity agreements and could charge -- whatever they

charged anyone, they could charge everyone.

Michigan's approach, on the other hand, would

allow dramatic increases in the fee amounts, in this case

an increase from 0 to $10 per truck, that would overwhelm

the administrative savings that Congress intended to

ensure through the single State approach.

20

That -- that also would be a very odd policy to

allow those increases since Congress would, in fact, have

It's

MR. CASEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I begin my principal argument, I would

22

like to spend just a moment on this -- this point of the

23

changeover in Michigan from base-plating to principal

24

place of business.

25

in this case at this point.

We believe it is not present in the --

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

This case was litigated on that point throughout

2

the Michigan courts up until the Michigan Supreme Court

3

decision.

4

Michigan had in place a system called base-

5

plating where we imposed fees based on the State in which

6

the vehicle was licensed.

7

changed from that base-plating system to a system that all

8

the other States used based on the principal place of

9

business of the truck carrier.

10

QUESTION:

That was what determined reciprocity.

11

MR. CASEY:

That's what determined reciprocity.

12

In early 1991, the system

That's correct.

13

And Yellow Freight Company, at that time Yellow

Transportation -- their trucks were licensed in Illinois,

15

a State with which Michigan has reciprocity, but its

principal place of business of the parent company is

17

Kansas, a State with which Michigan does not have

reciprocity.

21

fees, as normal industry and State practice, were sent out

1

The statute took effect here in December of

2

1991.

The statutory language that we're dealing with

3

talks about a fee that such State collected or charged as

4

of November 15th, 1991.

5

was litigated through the State courts is that Michigan

6

charged Yellow Freight before November 15th, 1991 and we

collected from Yellow Freight prior to 19 -- prior to

MR. CASEY:

Our argument on the -- the way it

Albeit on a system that didn't go

For the registration year 1992, we

12

charged and collected.

13

That's the way it was litigated up to the Michigan Supreme

14

Court.

15

reciprocity was relevant or irrelevant.

16

Yellow Freight disputed that.

It didn't involve this question of whether

The Michigan -- pardon me.

The Michigan Supreme

17

Court decided it on a -- a different basis than the other

18

State court opinions had.

19

which this Court granted certiorari.

20

And that raised the question

In its briefs, Yellow Transportation has implied

21

that we've somehow waived that issue.

We have not.

We

22

did not brief it in this Court because this Court limited

23

the grant of certiorari to the issue that the supreme

24

court did decide.

25

should be affirmed on the basis that the Supreme Court of

So we -- we believe that the case

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Michigan decided it.

If it is not affirmed, however, we

2

agree with the United States that the case should be

3

remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration

4

of this other issue which is still viable.

5

So turning now to our principal argument in

6

defense of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the

7

statute required the ICC to implement a fee system, to

8

adopt a fee for the States, a fee system for a fee not to

9

exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or

10

charged as of November 15th, 1991.
Beginning with the statutory language, under

11
12

Chevron, if the intent of Congress is clear, that's the

13

end of the matter.
The precise question that needs to be addressed

14
15

here is what did Congress intend.

16

the fee?

17

Under the language of this statute --

18

How do you determine

We believe that Congress's intent is clear.

QUESTION:

Well, if we think it isn't altogether

19

clear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we

20

have to consider Chevron deference?

21

the agency has interpreted it.

22

MR. CASEY:

Because that's how

If it -- yes, if -- if the statute

23

is not clear, then you proceed to the second step of

24

Chevron, which is whether the agency's interpretation is a

25

permissible one.

We believe we don't need to get to the

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

second step of Chevron because the text of the statute is

2

unambiguous.
QUESTION:

3

But if you're wrong about the text

4

being unambiguous -- and you do have an uphill argument

5

there because didn't the two lower courts in Michigan

6

reason the other way?

7

that the Michigan Supreme Court embraced?
MR. CASEY:

8
9

Didn't they reject the argument

The -- I agree the second step of

Chevron is always an uphill argument, to overcome an

10

agency interpretation.

11

this case, on the text of this statute, we believe that

12

the agency interpretation is impermissible.

13

what the agency did here was not just interpret the

14

statute; they have, in fact, rewritten it.

15

imposed conditions in the statute which are simply not

16

there.

But it -- it is still a burden that we believe we

can overcome because we believe that, as this Court did in

filing of the complaint.

of common sense to that, but it seems to me that by your

Of course.

As we've indicated in

MR. ROTHFELD:

18

19

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A

First, we think that the key issue in the case

20

has been identified by questions from a number of members

21

of the Court.

22

Now, we think what we would read into the statute is

23

clearly the correct thing to read into it, but even if we

24

are not absolutely right about that, petitioner should

25

prevail because given the agency's determination here, the

Something has to be read into the statute.

-- the tie goes to this side of the table and we think

2

that that should be dispositive on that issue in the case.

3

Second, there's been some discussion about

4

issues that are other issues in the case and -- and the

5

proper disposition as to them.

question about the existence of reciprocity agreements or

policies that would require remand, in response to Justice

13

no dispute throughout the entire course of this litigation

14

about whether there was such a policy and whether it was
