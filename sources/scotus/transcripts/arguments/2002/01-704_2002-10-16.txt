ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In each year's annual Appropriations Act,

11

Congress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,

12

and Firearms from investigating or acting upon

13

applications for discretionary relief from firearms

14

disabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c.)

15

held that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal

16

district court could itself grant respondent relief from

17

firearms disabilities.

18

fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action

19

under the Administrative Procedure Act.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

QUESTION:

The court of appeals

That holding is contrary to

Under the APA --

Mr. Kneedler -Yes.

-- you call it a statutory bar.

23

thought there was some difference in appropriations

24

statutes from ordinary, ordinary laws.

25

exactly the same?

I

Are the two

Could Congress create a substantive

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

obligation, for example, in an appropriations law, provide

2

that, oh, I don't know, nobody shall sell stock on

3

Tuesdays?

4

measure?

Could they put that in an appropriations

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

Yes.

An appropriations law is,

6

for purposes of Congress's lawmaking authority, no

7

different from any other sort of law.
QUESTION:

8
9

That's our holding in Roberts, isn't

it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Yes.

Now, what the Court has

11

said is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is

12

said to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law,

13

that intention has to be made clear, but here we think

14

that there's no question that the annual Appropriations

15

Act is clear.

16

did here.

17

either investigating or acting upon applications for

18

relief.

21

There is an express prohibition against ATF

QUESTION:

19
20

There's nothing implied about what Congress

You call this a suspension of the

law?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I mean, effectively.

22

a suspension -- it's an annual -- a suspension for a

23

period of 1 year.

24
25

QUESTION:

It's

I suppose Congress -- well, maybe --

I mean, I suppose Congress could say, this law that we

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enacted a year ago is suspended for 10 years.

2

go into effect for 10 years.

3
4
5
6
7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It will not

I suppose it could say that.

Yes, absolutely.

Congress could

certainly do that.
QUESTION:

Well, that's the holding of

Dickerson, is it not?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

So what we have here is an

8

express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that

9

Congress conferred on it.

Under the Administrative

10

Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial

11

review of agency action is to review what the agency did,

12

and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency

13

action is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.

14

QUESTION:

I don't know if it really bears on

15

the case, but suppose Congress had a completely different

16

scheme, and it said that the firearms violator's license

17

could be restored if he applied to United States district

18

court, no agency at all, you just go to court.

19

be a violation of Article III?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Would that

Well, I think there would be a

21

question about that.

As I recall, there was, and I think

22

it still may be true that courts may grant applications

23

for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that

24

there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the

25

sense that the Government could appear on the other side

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very

2

good point in terms of what would be the traditional way

3

that something like this would be accomplished, and that

4

is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did

5

in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive

6

branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and

7

then provided that a person whose application is denied

8

may file a petition in district court for judicial review

9

of such denial.

10

In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by

11

the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject

12

of judicial review.

13

QUESTION:

Is the refusal of the ATF to act on

14

an application pursuant to this provision in the

15

appropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

We think it is not.

As we

17

explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that

18

context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a

19

number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the

20

question have held, and what Congress said in the

21

Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting

22

upon the application.

23

grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore

24

the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing.

25

In other words, it can't either

We're not saying that there is no judicial

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

review at all.

2

available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial

3

review, or the form of the judicial review is either the

4

special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c),

5

or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another

6

appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions

7

of the APA.

8
9

The general provisions of the APA remain

But once again, the power of a court under the
general provisions of the APA is simply to review the

10

agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law,

11

and here the action was not contrary to law, it was

12

compelled by law.

13

could have challenged the agency's approach in this case,

14

its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which

15

provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set

16

aside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel

17

agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully

18

withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about

19

ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's

20

application for relief, because Congress compelled that

21

withholding.

The most direct avenue that respondent

QUESTION:

22

Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate

23

argument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for

24

this purpose.

25

on that?

Has the United States ever taken a position

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Yes, we have.

It is the

2

position of the United States that foreign convictions are

3

covered by the act.

4

The -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign

5

conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the

6

Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that

7

question.

8

not before this Court.

9

Now, that is not before the Court.

It wasn't presented in the petition and it's

Indeed, the question of whether a foreign

10

conviction would be a proper predicate is something that

11

would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution.

12

point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on

13

that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases,

14

criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would

15

be the proper place to begin to make that claim.

16

As we

Neither the general provisions of the APA nor

17

925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or

18

may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal

19

laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United

20

States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in

21

would be covered by a particular criminal statute.

22

even though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also

23

believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which

24

to raise such a claim in any event.

25

So

Respondent has argued that what is going on here

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or

2

the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case

3

such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied.

4

What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise

5

left the court's authority unaffected.

6

effect.

7

prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief,

8

there is no denial which could be the predicate for review

9

under that, under that special statutory review procedure.

10

925(c) remains in

It's just that, by virtue of Congress's

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that that's 100

11

percent clear?

12

prior statute was affected not by the simple means of

13

withholding appropriations.

14

different language that was going to govern the matter.

15

I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a

I mean, it set forth

Here, the only thing that has happened is

16

they're not given any appropriations, and you think it is

17

not a matter -- you think it's entirely clear that when

18

the Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot

19

act on this application because the appropriations rider

20

forbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that

21

does not amount to a denial of the application?

22
23
24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that's the better reading

of the statute.
QUESTION:
is it clear?

Well, it may be the better one, but

I mean, the law is that unless you make it

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

quite clear in the appropriations statute that you are

2

intending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not

3

amended.
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

Again, the -- our position is not

5

that Congress amended the judicial review provision of

6

925(c).

7

925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect.

8

The question is whether the -- whether Congress's

9

directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for

What it did was prohibit ATF from acting.

10

relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred

11

from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer

12

the Court also to the general definition of agency action

13

under the APA, which we cite in our brief.

14

U.S.C. 551(13).

15

rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,

16

or the denial thereof, or a failure to act.

17

This is 5

It defines agency action as an agency

So under the APA, which is the general statute

18

governing traditional review of agency action, Congress

19

itself has defined a denial of relief as something

20

different from a failure to act, and I think there's every

21

reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being

22

consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general

23

definitions that Congress has applied under the APA.

24
25

I would also add, though, that it doesn't
matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA

2

standards for reviewing that denial still apply.

3

point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and

4

the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive

5

Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a

6

special statutory review procedure that establishes the

7

form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the

8

Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that

9

judicial review is defined by the general provisions of

10

the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions

11

the court can only set aside agency action that is

12

contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was

13

compelled by law, not contrary to it.

14

As we

So whichever avenue this suit was thought to

15

have been brought under, there was no basis for the

16

district court to grant relief at all, and we also think

17

that that is entirely consistent with the Congress's

18

purposes in enacting the appropriations bar.

19

The legislative history which respondent has

20

produced as an appendix to his brief explains that

21

Congress had become concerned about the inherently

22

subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking,

23

and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had

24

made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the

25

money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a

3

Why didn't it just repeal the thing,

then, because it didn't have the votes?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what it decided to do is to

It would -- which means it

could be subject to revision each year.

13
14

QUESTION:

This was in the appropriations law

just for the ATF, or for the whole Treasury Department?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

QUESTION:

It's in the provision for ATF.

Suppose that the Secretary had some

17

other agency -- the Secret Service didn't have much to do

18

that month; could he direct them to process some of these

19

applications?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think not, for there is another

21

sentence in the appropriations provision for ATF which

22

says that no money may be spent to transfer functions from

23

ATF to another department or agency, and I think the

24

reference to agency in that provision would probably

25

include other provisions -- or excuse me, other agencies

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

within the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary

2

of the Treasury personally couldn't be expected to act on

3

applications like this.

4

pointed out in the Dunne decision, has -QUESTION:

5

The Secretary, as this Court

Well, would he abuse his discretion

6

if he took that function away from ATF?

7

there's a provision in the statute that he -- that the

8

Secretary himself cannot transfer the function?
MR. KNEEDLER:

9

You say that

It says, no funds shall be

10

spent -- I believe it says, under this act, to transfer

11

functions to another agency within ATF.
QUESTION:

12

Well, how much money does the --

13

would the Secretary spend if he signed an order

14

transferring a function?
MR. KNEEDLER:

15

Well, the clear import of what

16

Congress directed is, the function shall not be

17

transferred.

18

at.

19
20
21

That was clearly what Congress was driving

QUESTION:

It wouldn't be a transfer to another

agency if the Secretary did it himself.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, but the Secretary -- first

22

of all, as Congress well knew when it passed this

23

appropriations rider, the Secretary has delegated the

24

authority for acting on these applications to ATF.

25

is the legal framework against which --

That

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

What he gave he could withdraw.

2

QUESTION:

He could revoke.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Perhaps he -- I mean, he

4

presumably could, but the proper avenue for a respondent

5

to pursue in that situation would be to request ATF -- or

6

excuse me, the Secretary to revoke the regulation that

7

produced the delegation, and then if the Secretary

8

declined to do that, to seek review of that under the APA

9

on an arbitrary and capricious standard.

10

Respondent has not pursued that avenue, and we

11

think it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious

12

for the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on

13

that function himself with all the other functions that

14

are before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to

15

the Nation's economy and banking and all those other

16

matters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and

17

capricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the

18

face of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted,

19

with the -- again, with the clear understanding that it

20

didn't want these applications to be acted on

21

administratively, but in any event --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Kneedler -I'm sorry.

Mr. Kneedler, if we shift the focus

from the agency to the court, is it your essential

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argument that Congress provided for an appellate,

2

essentially an appellate role for the district court and

3

not a first instance role?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, that --

So that the only authority the court

6

would have would be to review a decision made by an

7

executive official, but there is a provision in this law

8

for the district court to take additional evidence.

9

Usually when a court is performing a review function it

10
11

doesn't take any evidence.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Excuse me.

That's correct, but

12

it would -- but even the admission or acceptance of

13

additional evidence would be in aid of the APA review,

14

which is, again, of the agency's decision.

15

receiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even

16

under the arbitrary and capricious standard.

17

Court pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will

18

be situations in which additional evidence or an

19

explanation from the agency could be received in judicial

20

review, but that's only supplemental of the record that

21

was before the agency.

22

QUESTION:

A court

As this

Well, but the agency doesn't always

23

have to make a record.

I mean, suppose the agency just,

24

you know, just makes a decision.

25

treat it as a matter of review?

Why can't this Court

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court will be whether the action here, assuming it's a

2

denial, was unreasonable?
MR. KNEEDLER:

3

The question before the Court

4

would be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or

5

unlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress

6

compelled it.

7

to act on the application.

8

called a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford

9

any relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could

Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not
Now, whether or not that's

10

not set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that

11

aside.
Looked at another way, the only relevant

12
13

evidence that would be introduced in court would be

14

evidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a

15

time when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending.

16

That is the only relevant evidence that -QUESTION:

17

Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a

18

question?

19

either or both -- say they spent the weekend together

20

sometimes.

21

on a Sunday afternoon and said, gee, this is a case of

22

rank injustice, I think we're going to grant the petition,

23

and they entered some kind of an order granting it, would

24

that have violated any statutes?

25

Supposing the Secretary or the head of the ATF,

They read through the papers on their own time

MR. KNEEDLER:

It would.

It would violate this

statute.

capacity, and the -- and -QUESTION:

The order, whatever they might have read on

It would be in their official

capacities but it wouldn't have cost the Government a
dime.
QUESTION:
official capacity.

Doesn't -- the statute doesn't say,
It says, expend funds.

MR. KNEEDLER:

It says expend funds, but it

14

means to act -- but it says, to -- it is directed to the

15

actions of the ATF in its official capacity.

16

official act of ATF could relieve someone from firearms

17

disabilities.

18

QUESTION:

Only an

I suppose the argument is that the --

19

certainly the Secretary, and perhaps all Federal

20

officials, don't get paid by the hour, they get paid for

21

all the official actions that they take during the year,

22

so that even if they take it on a Saturday they're being

23

compensated for it.

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, and --

Minimally, but compensated.

(Laughter.)

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

They are paid for the office, not

3

for the work that they are performing, nor could the

4

Secretary direct ATF to grant it, because again he would

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress, in section 925(c), provided

14
15

individuals like Respondent Tommy Bean two rights vis a

16

vis the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of

17

America.

18

Secretary" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if

19

the Secretary denies that application, they may secure

20

judicial review.

21

position this morning, as several of the later questions

22

identified, is that Congress has never, expressly or

23

impliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary.

24

The appropriations statutes that are before you address

25

only the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, "the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress has set aside a separate and special budget for

2

the Department of the Treasury generally, which is under

3

the control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and

4

the right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected.

5

QUESTION:

Well, now, did your client seek to

6

proceed before the Secretary?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

Yes.

Page 27 of the joint

8

appendix is the application.

It's directed to the

9

Secretary of the Treasury, care of BATF.

We went, as the

10

statute directs, to the Secretary of the Treasury.

11

Secretary of the Treasury told Tommy Bean that he was not

12

going to restore firearms rights.

Well, this was not a personal

conversation between the two, I take it.

the conclusion are not -- of your question are not

The definition of denial is a refusal to grant the

requested relief.

The ATF on behalf of the Secretary said, I'm not
The definition of

That's --

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldstein, may I back you up just

8

a bit, because I'm looking at the letter you cited.

9

addressed to the Secretary, but it's care of Director of

10

the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Congress

11

passes all kinds of laws giving the Secretary authority to

12

do this or that, which the Secretary invariably delegates,

13

and I can't think of an instance where a regime of this

14

order is taken over by the Secretary herself, rather than

15

by some delegatee, but this is the kind of thing that's

16

made to order for, not the top person, but for it to be

17

delegated.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is

Can I address both the question

19

of whether there are other examples of the scheme we've

20

described, which is to say, the agency head does it, and

21

then the question of whether or not, if this were a novel

22

scheme, it would matter?

23

The premise that there aren't parallels for this

24

is not correct.

I can give you three examples.

The

25

Attorney General is required to personally certify any

Federal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations,

which are at 18 U.S.C. 245.

That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593.

that it's a personal obligation or a nondelegable

those statutes use?

It's the two in combination.

QUESTION:

-- certify, et cetera.

How do they

provide for that so-called personal action?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

They generally say, the Attorney

4

General shall certify, and the courts have interpreted

5

that -- I believe there is an example that says,

6

personally.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9

Which we don't have here.
We definitely do not have here,

but we have the equivalent, and then I'll get to Justice,

10

the underlying question of Justice Ginsburg's, and that

11

is, does it matter if this is done in a different way.
We have here the parallel, because what happened

12
13

is that Congress defined the Secretary to be that

14

individual or the delegate, and in the appropriations laws

15

has told ATF, as the delegate, that they may not act on

16

anything else, and the parallel provision that Mr.

17

Kneedler pointed to, which is that the Secretary may not

18

transfer to any other division or agency.
What Congress did not say -- and this is

20

extraordinarily important.

21

case.

22

other act, or no funds in the subsection dealing with the

23

budget of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be used.

24

Now, it is that --

25

It's the key to the entire

Congress did not say that no funds in this or any

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it didn't say that

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because it thought it was perfectly clear that if it

2

didn't want public money used under -- by the delegate, it

3

presumably wouldn't want public funds used for the same

4

purpose by everybody else, which seems like a fairly

5

reasonable assumption.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

QUESTION:

8
9
10

Maybe --

I mean, why isn't it a reasonable

assumption?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
QUESTION:

It may be, but what --

Well, if it is a reasonable

11

assumption, haven't we got to take that into consideration

12

in interpreting the annual bar, and hold against you,

13

otherwise we'll be clearly -- we would clearly be going

14

against the intent of Congress?

15
16
17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, and that's the underlying

point to Justice Ginsburg's questions.
QUESTION:

This Court --

My first question started out, it

18

seems that you in the beginning of this process understood

19

that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was the

20

relevant actor, because you addressed the Secretary care

21

of that agency, not the Secretary --

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And let me explain why.

The 27

23

C.F.R. 178144(a), which has never been repealed, required

24

us to send it to ATF.

25

regulation on the books that says we have to submit it to

We had no choice.

There's a

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Director.

We didn't have a choice, but to make

2

perfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we

3

say, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF.
But I need to return to Justice Souter's

4
5

question, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in

6

many other instances of statutory construction, to say, we

7

get the general sense of what Congress was trying to do?

8

The answer is no.

9

has to turn square corners.

The relevant text of any

10

statute is section 925(c).

It's never been repealed.

11

says --

12

In this area of law uniquely, Congress

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that Congress

13

was just wasting its time here.

14

something.

15

It

It was trying to do

It just didn't accomplish it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, and let

16

me get to that point, and that is, I agree with you that

17

it would be foolish to say that the appropriations acts

18

are completely ineffective, and if our interpretation were

19

to deprive them of any value, we agree it would be highly

20

questionable.

It is not.

21

The scheme that results is clearly one under

22

which the Secretary will grant only those applications

23

where the right to relief is perfectly clear.

24

in this case, it is --

25

QUESTION:

How do you know that?

Where, as

You say the

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

scheme that results, I don't see how you can see that from

2

the enactment in question.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

Because, Mr. Chief Justice, what

4

Congress did is, it created a system under which the

5

subdivisions underneath the Secretary may not investigate

6

or act.

It's left to the Secretary, and now it is -QUESTION:

7

But the -- that just doesn't fit with

8

the real world.

9

the International Monetary Fund meeting is going to

10

The idea that the Secretary on his way to

address an application like this just doesn't make sense.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, with respect,

12

we -- well, first of all, the text of the statute we think

13

is enough on its face, but on the question of whether or

14

not it makes sense, we think it does, because -- and I

15

will point you to several other examples in Federal

16

firearms law where Congress has adopted categorical rules

17

allowing felons to have their rights restored.
We believe this is a safety valve.

18

We're not

19

saying that the Secretary has to grant any particular

20

application.

21

recognized that there would be extraordinary cases.

22

Congress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million

23

granting 3,000 applications, and that's what the

24

legislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut

25

off.

What we're saying is that Congress
What

What we are describing is a very different animal.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and

2

that is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief.

3

Now, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of

4

your question was that there's a delegation here.

5

delegation here is not exclusive.

6

provides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was

7

created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall

8

act under the general supervision of the Secretary and

9

under -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the

11

The

Assistant Secretary.
The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor

12

General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi

13

case, and those were exclusive delegations.

14

States v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 695

15

of the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary

16

authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney

17

General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's

18

decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the

19

Court said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the

20

Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of

21

Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that

22

the AG would stay out of the process.

23

In United

In any event, not only is this not an exclusive

delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an

illegal delegation.

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldstein, I would -- you are

2

concentrating on the agency end of it.

Looking at it from

3

the perspective of a court, you seem to be making of the

system.

You're having the district court in effect being

We don't have district judges performing that

10

kind of mixed function, proceeding in that ex parte way.

11

It would be extraordinary for Congress to make such a

provision, and yet you want us to infer it.

how it works.

QUESTION:

At J.A. --

In what sense it was adversary?

Usually, if the bureau hadn't been disabled by Congress it

would say, deny an application, and then there would be a

24

was no position taken on the merits.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm almost there.

What happened here is

Well, why -- if the United States was

14

a party, as I suppose is the purport of what you're

15

saying, why isn't that a violation of the appropriations

16

rider, so that we must disregard it?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because, Justice Kennedy,

18

nothing in the appropriations rider prohibits either of

19

the two following things: First, the United States

20

Attorney showing up and representing the United States,

21

relatedly the Secretary of the Treasury showing up; or the

22

ATF participating at the petition stage, as opposed to the

23

application stage.

24
25

I think it's very important to recognize here
that this case has proceeded up until today on the

4

QUESTION:

Six chiefs

I don't know that that's an argument.

5

I mean, I concede that.

I'm still left back at Justice

6

Scalia's question, because I thought in response to his

7

question you -- I had the impression you were suggesting

8

that the Secretary had somewhere written a piece of paper

9

that in effect denied the application, and I looked

10

through this appendix -- I've been doing that and

11

listening at the same time --

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

-- and I cannot find that letter.
Right.

All I find in the appendix is

16

something written by Ms. Pamela Potaczek, who is from the

17

ATF, and what that says is, because of the restriction we

18

are returning Mr. Bean's application for restoration.

19

That's the end of that.

He can apply again.

20

Now, is there some other piece of paper?

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

No.

No.
Our position is --

Well then, if there is no other piece

of paper, what is the response to Justice Scalia's

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

question, which was simply that there has been no denial?

2

They return the application, and if your client felt that

3

they should have acted on it, he should file a request in

4

the district court for -- of course, as soon as you do

5

that, the Secretary will come in and say, of course I

6

didn't act on it.

7

the question will be whether that's a reasonable

8

interpretation of this statute, and then, of course, the

9

Government thinks of course it's a reasonable

10

interpretation, and even if it's an incorrect

11

interpretation, at least reasonable.

That's what Congress meant.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

And then

Right.

Now, that's where I am, which is, I

think, what Justice Scalia was raising.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

Justice Breyer, you have several

16

questions.

17

was there a denial here, second, does it matter whether

18

there was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that

19

the Government's position and interpretation is

20

reasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory

21

language?

22

Let me deal with them in the following terms:

The plain meaning of the word denial is a

23

refusal to grant the relief requested.

Our position is

24

that when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying,

25

we're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

act, it's a refusal to act.

2

point to their own regulation that means it must be so.

3

That is a denial, and I can

Under subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing

4

regulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any

5

of the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is

6

not quoted in any of the appendices.

7

provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms

8

licensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and

9

that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms

10

under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers,

11

importers, collectors.

12

Under that

In the latter class, any person who submits an

13

application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30

14

days, until 30 days after the denial.

15

is -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the

16

application.

17

If the Government

If the Government is correct here, it would make

18

the profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical

19

consequence that no licensed collector has ever been

20

denied, and they all have the right to continue operating.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that's true if we assume your

22

first premise, that a failure to act is a denial, and

23

that's the question.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
Justice Souter.

Oh, no, just the reverse,

Let me be clear.

The regulation says

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that you get to keep operating under your license until 30

2

days after the denial.

3

Mr. Kneedler's premise that all these letters that ATF has

4

been sending out are not denials --

5

QUESTION:

What I'm saying is, if you accept

No, but the -- that provision assumes

6

that there is going to be action upon the request, that

7

the ATF or the Treasury will take it under advisement and

8

in effect say, yes, we'll tell you yes or no when we've

9

had time, and that's not what is happening here, and if

10

that, in fact, is a fair distinction, then the statute

11

you're just referring to doesn't even apply.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Souter, if the

13

Government is correct -- and I won't belabor this point.

14

If the Government is correct that the ATF letters don't

15

count as denials, then every licensed dealer in the United

16

States can continue operating indefinitely.

17

QUESTION:

18

around in a circle.

19

we don't accept your premise that a refusal to act and, in

20

fact, a very candid refusal to act is tantamount to a

21

denial, then your conclusion doesn't follow and the

22

statute that you refer to doesn't apply.

23

Well, once again, we're just going
If we accept your premise, sure.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'll move on, then.

If

I

24

respectfully disagree, but I -- and I think the language

25

will track in our direction, but let me move on, because

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Justice Breyer had two subsidiary questions.
QUESTION:

2

In respect to that, is there an

3

instance where they sent a letter back to a firearms

4

licensee saying, well, we aren't going to process this

5

because of the statute, and then the firearms licensee

6

said, well, you haven't denied it, I'll stay in business,

7

and then they went to the firearms licensee and said, no,

8

you can't stay in business?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9
10
11

I don't know the answer to that

question.
QUESTION:

All right.

Well, if we don't know

12

the answer to that, we don't know, in other words, whether

13

or not this reg does or does not stand in the way.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

Well, my impression --

So I understand -My impression is that it's a

form letter that goes out to everyone.

18

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Now, you -- I had promised to

20

come back to the question of whether, in this case, it

21

matters that we didn't get what this Court would conclude

22

to be a technical denial letter, notwithstanding if you

23

accept the rest of our argument that we have the right to

24

compel the Secretary to give us one,

25

our position is that the Secretary had the duty to act.

So to play this out,

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary

2

didn't act here.

3

My point is, that doesn't matter.

The question

4

presented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to

5

it, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of

6

it, whether a Federal district court has the authority to

7

grant relief.

8

in the district court that there was an insufficient

9

premise for us to be in district court.

10

The Government has never contended, again,

The question before this Court is whether or not

11

the right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review

12

in section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us

13

back to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third

14

subsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is

15

Justice Souter's point.

16

recognize basically what Congress was after here, and I

17

will turn to the answer.

18

Isn't it enough for us to

It is no.

TVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other,

19

Dickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly

20

clear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia

21

started out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be

22

categorical.

23

section 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be

24

irreconcilable, and that is not the case here.

25

The conflict between the two statutes,

QUESTION:

I don't know that that was the

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

holding of Dickerson.

I mean, they went into legislative

2

history -- you couldn't just say it jumped out at you.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, then I

4

will take you to TVA v. Hill, which does address this

5

issue.

6

of legislative history here is the kind of legislative

7

history that would draw Justice Souter and possibly

8

Justice Breyer to the conclusion that we know basically

9

what Congress was trying to do.

The Court has made perfectly clear that the kind

Those are Appropriations

10

Committee reports, and this Court could not have been more

11

clear that those are not an accurate indicia of

12

congressional intent.

13

QUESTION:

There are --

Mr. Goldstein, before we get into

14

legislative history and how it bears on this, I see

15

Congress having established traditional roles where the

16

executive was going to be the investigator, the court was

17

going to be the reviewer.

18

authority to act.

19

authority to act, it's not granting or denying the relief

20

requested, so isn't that the proper way to look at what

21

the agency is doing?

22

to act, it isn't granting or denying.

23

The agency says, we have no

When a court says, we don't have

When it says, we have no authority

And then on the court, the court said, Congress

24

set us up to be a court of review, not first view.

The

25

agency hasn't looked at it because it says it has no

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authority to do it.

Congress did not give us the

2

authority, ever, to take a first view of this.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

Justice Ginsburg, let me -- can

4

I start at the end of what I think is the consequence of

5

several of these questions, and then come back to the

6

difference between administrative review and judicial

7

review, and whether this would just be unknown to American

8

law?

9

The very best we think that the Government can

10

get out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that

11

says we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary.

12

we came to Federal district court and asked for relief,

13

the best the Government could do was an order that says,

14

no, you should have acted.

15

When

What can't be the case, we believe, is that the

16

Secretary would be able to just let these things pile up

17

on his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough.

18

Now, the -- what we take --

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22
23

He didn't deny them.

He said the

agency has no authority to rule on these applications.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right, and if we conclude that's

not a denial, we can't get into court.
The Government's answer, I think, if we move

24

down the road, will be that we should file another

25

lawsuit, an APA lawsuit that says, to compel agency action

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unreasonably withheld, and if you take that position, if

2

you conclude that this is agency inaction instead of an

3

agency refusal to act, the surreply to that, the answer is

4

that you should treat this as an APA action.

5

provision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C.

6

703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall

7

be the special review provision provided by statute, and

8

that's section 925(c).
If we were required to file under the APA we

9
10
11

The

did.

That's -QUESTION:

The serious underlying question here

12

is, I agree with you that you found a literal way around

13

this, and so you're saying, well, if there's a literal way

14

around it, and you have a statute saying do it, that you

15

ought to do it, whatever the form of the action is to get

16

the case here, and I guess the underlying thing is, well,

17

my goodness, everyone knows what Congress wants here.

18

It's perfectly obvious.

19

And so a Secretary who said, I'm not going to

20

enforce this statute because Congress doesn't want me to

21

even though there's a literal way I could do it without

22

technically violating the actual language of the

23

prohibition, does the Secretary have the right to do that?

24

Well, I would think the answer to that question's yes.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The answer --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

Mr. Kneedler framed the question as whether or

Mr. Kneedler -- thankfully.

8

not the Secretary abused his discretion by not withdrawing

9

the delegation, by saying, I knew what Congress was up to,

this is my agency, I know how this thing works.
The answer is that this is not a question of

will act on these things.

Is your submission limited to cases that

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The right to apply to the

21

Secretary would remain.

We think it's clear that the

22

Secretary, once his obligation to act is recognized, will

23

set up standards.

24

to grant relief if it's an -- the legislative history

25

refers to a technical or unintentional violation where

He'll say things like, I'm only going

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there are sworn statements in front of me that make

2

perfectly clear this person is no threat whatsoever.
That will be up to the Secretary.

3

The Secretary

4

will get to decide, and if he's granting too many

5

applications, Congress will come along and say, no funding

6

under this or any other act shall be expended to

7

investigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c)

8

applications.
The critical thing, and the -- is that the

9

Government does not dispute that this appropriations rider

ATF.

can't have the courts doing that, too.

intends, to strip away the statute and to do it in

QUESTION:

If you want to talk about Congress working, they
We can't have the executive

It will take no

So I'm still left with -- assuming

21

all that, I'm still left with the problem that you've

22

asked for the court to make the decision rather than

23

asking to have the Secretary make the decision.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

We have a, now, I think,

a different question of administrative law, and that is

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the fundamental principle, in the APA context or a

2

parallel like 925(c), is it only the court that can enter

3

the order saying, you have a right to relief?

4

where's the proper order, send it to the Secretary and

5

saying, it would be an abuse of discretion, it's

6

absolutely clear under the statute you're entitled to it.

7

Now, the court here did the latter.

Or does --

If this

8

Court decided that was technically incorrect, it could

9

reverse on that ground and say, no, no, no, the correct

10

technical judgment is to put it back in the hands of the

11

Secretary.

12

QUESTION:

But you didn't ask for it to be put

13

back in the hands of the Secretary.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17
18

And neither did the Government.

You're saying that the court had an

obligation to give you something you didn't even ask for?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
what we asked for.

Mr. Justice Scalia, they gave us

I apologize for that.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If --

That was the wrong thing.
If they should have --

If they should have done

23

something else, then this Court can tell it so, but we --

I don't think it's fair to hold us to the position that

25

the Government did not object, that only the Secretary --

record, that the only proper remedy is an order to the

Secretary to grant us relief, as opposed to granting us

relief personally.

here.

With respect, we did what we were supposed to do

14

to get relief here, and if the Court decides that it only

should have gone to the Secretary, that's a minor change

16

in the judgment.

17

QUESTION:

I still think participation by ATF in

18

the judicial proceeding is within 925(c), and Congress was

forbidden that, too.

can the Secretary use assistance, or would that constitute

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

He can.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the argument

that the Secretary could have granted relief was never

10

raised below in this case.

11

of appeals, it wasn't raised in the brief in opp, it was

12

raised for the first time in respondent's brief, and again

13

if -- we think the proper avenue for that would be a suit

14

to the -- suing the Secretary under the APA or --

15

QUESTION:

It was not raised in the court

No, but his point, and actually

16

although he raised it late, is certainly a factor.

17

seems to me the most powerful argument, that there's no

18

point sending it back to the Secretary, really, even

19

though that's the correct procedural route, if the

20

Secretary under the law has no choice, and what he's

21

saying is, the Secretary under the law has no choice, and

22

the reason is because literally this appropriations

23

measure doesn't cover the Secretary's action.

24
25

That

And given the absence of that, the Secretary's
under a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

adds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that

2

really under normal legislative principles if they want to

3

repeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us

4

to consider this literally in this circumstance. So that,

5

I think, is -- that's an argument that's worth hearing

6

what the reply is.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- first of all, I think

8

it is wrong.

judgment, but with respect --

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

It would be a different disposition of the

Well, maybe we'd reach a different -Right.

The disposition would be one thing -Right.

-- but he's saying, that's really

what the heart of this is about.
MR. KNEEDLER:

There's -- first of all, let me

17

make another point which I think goes very much to the

18

Secretary's authority.

19

our reply brief general principles of appropriations law

20

that are really a particular application of the general

21

principle that the specific governs the general, and under

22

appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of

23

money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent

24

for that task.

25

to perform that task.

We point out on page 4 and 5 of

Money can't be drawn from some other pot

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

We think that principle should apply a fortiori,

2

or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the

3

Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the

4

expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the

5

Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did

6

not expect money to be drawn from some other pot.

7

a general principle of appropriations law.

8

least, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

That is

At the very

What is the authority for saying

that's a general principle of appropriations law?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There are a number of Comptroller

12

General opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of

13

our reply brief, and it's against principles like that

14

that agencies always act in deciding how they're going to

15

spend money.

16

the right disposition would be to present it to the

17

Secretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute,

18

just like all the other statutes that need to be

19

administered, and the way to do that --

20

But if this argument was going to be made,

QUESTION:

It's one thing to say that when

21

Congress says we give $500,000 to subunit B to perform

22

this function, you cannot use $2 million from somewhere

23

else to perform the same function.

24

It's something quite different, however, to say that when

25

you have forbidden one unit from doing something, and

That's one thing.

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there is a general statute which allows the Secretary to

2

do it, that that prohibition also applies to the

3

Secretary.

I just don't think it's parallel.

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

Well, at the very least it would

5

not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to

6

decline to withdraw the delegation.

7

the question that would arise in that situation, because

8

the Secretary now may not act on these applications.

9

He -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the

14

petition for rulemaking.

15

He would have to withdraw the delegation.

He hasn't

The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this

16

power back to himself, could at the very least take into

17

account what Congress has said about not wanting these

18

applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons

19

the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective

20

undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we

21

don't want this function being performed because of the

22

potential consequences.

23

other purposes in fighting crime.

24

it entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on

25

this function himself.

easily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress

It's -- it's,
