Ms. Birnbaum, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BIRNBAUM:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
This case arose from a single failure by State

12

Farm to settle a third party automobile case in the State

13

of Utah within the policy limits of its insured in Utah.

14

There was evidence in the record, uncontroverted

15

evidence, that this was the only case in the State of Utah

16

where a policyholder of State Farm had been subject to

17

potentially a threat of execution on a judgment.

18

the other judgments that were in excess of policy limits,

19

which there were seven of in the State of Utah over a 14-

20

year period, including both before and after

21

Mr. Campbell's case --

22
23

QUESTION:

All of

Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you a

question about the record?

24

MS. BIRNBAUM:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

As I understand the other side, what

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is at issue is a policy that your company had over the

2

years, I forget the name of it, BP and something or other,

3

and I looked for that policy in the record, and I couldn't

4

find it.

Is it in the record?

5

MS. BIRNBAUM:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Is there a written --

It's in the lodging, Your Honor.

It's a lodging?
It's at 1506 to 1531 in the

8

lodging, and if you look at the B, so-called PP&R -- it's

9

called the Performance Planning and Review Manual -- it is

10

a guide.

11

evaluate personnel, and it applies to all, all the

12

personnel of State Farm, all thousands of personnel, and

13

what the plaintiff did was to cherry-pick from this long

14

manual which is in the lodging, as I said, one or two

15

points that didn't even apply to claims adjustors or

16

claims representatives, but to supervisors, to try to

17

create this pervasive nationwide scheme that there was an

18

attempt by State Farm over 20 years to lessen the claims

19

that they were paying and not pay the fair value of

20

claims.

21

It is a personnel evaluation guide on how to

QUESTION:

Nonetheless, if the jury found such a

22

policy, that there was a policy as alleged by the

23

plaintiff, that's not -- we have to take that as a given,

24

don't we, Ms. Birnbaum?

25

MS. BIRNBAUM:

You may have to take that as a

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

given, Your Honor, but the question becomes, how is that

2

policy related in any way to this decision to try a case

3

in the State of Utah, and how can State Farm be punished

4

for its nationwide conduct, when all this case was about,

5

and should have been about --

6

QUESTION:

Do you say the evidence of conduct in

7

other jurisdictions should have been excluded, it was

8

inadmissible?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

9

Your Honor, some evidence could

10

have come in under this Court's determination in BMW to

11

show reprehensibility, but evidence that could have come

12

in to show reprehensibility had to be comparable to the

13

conduct that was at stake here.
QUESTION:

14

Well, what do you say to the argument

15

on the other side that the instances of conduct involving

16

facts having nothing to do with settlement within policy

17

limits, all came in, in effect as rebuttal, as admissible

18

rebuttal evidence in response to issues that State Farm

19

raised?

20

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Your Honor, the record is replete

21

in our opening brief.

We cite to the many times all of

22

this evidence came in on direct, of the plaintiff's

23

experts and the plaintiff's so-called fact experts.

24

That's a makeshift argument.

25

This was a 2 and month trial on -- and most of that trial

This didn't just come in.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was geared to this nationwide scheme.
And more importantly, if you look at what the

2
3

Utah Supreme Court said in reinstating this incredibly

4

excessive verdict, 145 to 1, when you look at that, it is

5

very clear that the Utah Supreme Court was looking at a

6

national scheme.
QUESTION:

7

Well, yes, that may be.

I mean, I

8

think there's no question it was looking at a national

9

scheme.

The question is whether our gripe, or your gripe

10

is with the Utah Supreme Court or with the case as it was

11

tried, and I take it your answer to my question is, there

12

was evidence going to practices having nothing to do with

13

settlement within policy limits that did come in without

14

any relationship to rebuttal at all.

15

MS. BIRNBAUM:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. BIRNBAUM:

18

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

Okay.
And it's all cited in our brief,

in our opening brief, many, many times.

19

QUESTION:

And why doesn't --

20

QUESTION:

And were objections made each time?

21

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Your Honor, there was not,

22

because that wasn't necessary in the State of Utah.

23

litigant objects in limine to the introduction of this

24

evidence, which was done --

25

QUESTION:

That was done.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

If a

1

MS. BIRNBAUM:

That was many times done, and

2

Your Honor, when this case came down with the case of BMW

3

v. Gore, there was an oral argument made that that kind of

4

evidence was unconstitutional under Gore, because it was

5

dissimilar and extraterritorial.

6

QUESTION:

Ms. Birnbaum, why doesn't it go to

7

reprehensibility if it were true that this failure to

8

settle claims that were quite valid was simply part of a

9

nationwide pattern to pay out less than was due, not just

10

in this context but in every context?

11

to reprehensibility?

12

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Why doesn't that go

Because, Your Honor, if we are --

13

if we permit litigants to create this overriding scheme

14

that you are engaged in fraud in all your business

15

practices, and that you can be punished for that, it is as

16

if in Gore --

17

QUESTION:

Well, I think it does go to

18

reprehensibility if we're giving some kind of an ethical

19

report card to State Farm.

20

MS. BIRNBAUM:

21

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

It does not go to reprehensibility, I

22

would think would be your point, as to the harm suffered

23

by this plaintiff.

24

MS. BIRNBAUM:

25

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And that seems to me the difference.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BIRNBAUM:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Your Honor --

You say it would go to

3

reprehensibility, and it would go to the harm suffered by

4

this plaintiff, if they introduced evidence of doing the

5

same thing to other plaintiffs in other States, the same

6

thing to other plaintiffs.

7

to this plaintiff?

8

MS. BIRNBAUM:

9

QUESTION:

How does that go to the harm

Well, Your Honor --

You know, I don't understand how you

10

can possibly say you cannot introduce evidence from other

11

States, and at the same time say, unless it's introduced

12

to show reprehensibility.

13

Once you say you're allowed to introduce it for

14

reprehensibility, I don't know why all of this doesn't go

15

to show that State Farm is more reprehensible.

16

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Your Honor, because in Gore v.

17

BMW this Court, the majority of this Court held that you

18

can introduce on the reprehensibility question similar

19

conduct that compares to the conduct that occurred to the

20

particular plaintiff in the underlying case.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Of course, that's all that was

offered in Gore, of course.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

But that -- but Your Honor, it

would be like -QUESTION:

So we didn't really have to reach

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

your question in that case.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

Your Honor, but it would be like

3

in Gore saying that there was a plan to maximize profits,

4

and that not only could you introduce and consider the

5

repair issues that occurred in Gore, but you could also

6

show that there was discrimination against minority

7

customers, that there was --

8

QUESTION:

9

But the answer is that all that does

go to reprehensibility.

It does.

A person who commits

10

this conduct and is part of a company that engages in all

11

kinds of bad action is a person who is somewhat more

12

reprehensible than if you worked for a company that

13

doesn't engage in all this bad action, but I thought your

14

point was that that's true, but unless you draw a line

15

like the line that was drawn in Gore, you are inviting a

16

jury to punish the company for all kinds of things that

17

truly do make them more reprehensible, but without

18

standards, without a legislature telling them how

19

reprehensible, et cetera.

20
21

MS. BIRNBAUM:

I couldn't have said it any

better, Your Honor.

22

(Laughter.)

23

QUESTION:

Well then, maybe -- maybe you can

24

tell me how one defines reprehensibility so that it only

25

includes what you call the same acts.

Maybe you can tell

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

me.

That's what gives me the trauma, and you say not

2

different acts.

3

something --

What is different acts? It has to be

4

MS. BIRNBAUM:

5

QUESTION:

6

-- other than a policyholder who --

you know, who passed five, six cars on the highway?

7

MS. BIRNBAUM:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, I think --

No.

No, you have --

Why isn't cheating all policyholders

in all contexts, paying less than they're entitled to, why
isn't that similar to what happened here?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

11

Because it had nothing to do with

12

what happened here, and I'd like to explain to you.

13

it's a little -- but what happens in third party and first

14

party cases, in this particular case there was a decision

15

to go to trial.

16

trial?

17

some of the claims represented felt this was a no

18

liability case.

19

not liable, that they didn't cause this accident.

20

wasn't a no-brainer.

21

decided on other evidence.

22

Maybe

Why was that decision made to go to

Because at least the lawyers for State Farm in

Mr. and Mrs. Campbell said that they were

There was evidence.

This

The jury

But when you bring into this equation 20 years

23

of conduct that, some of it that is lawful, this wasn't

24

only fraudulent conduct.

25

instructed -- not instructed, but in the summation there

This jury heard and was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was references to the payment of non-OEM, the

2

specification of non-OEM parts, was perfectly legal in

3

almost every jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION:

How would you formulate the standard

5

that you want us to adopt, the standard which confines the

6

reprehensibility evidence to what you deem to be

7

appropriate in a case such as this?

8

MS. BIRNBAUM:

9

QUESTION:

10

I think --

What rule do we have?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

I think, Your Honor, the proper

11

reprehensibility inquiry is limited to an examination of a

12

defendant's specific misconduct toward the plaintiff and

13

similar conduct by the defendant toward others, but it has

14

to be similar.

15

This was not similar conduct requiring --

QUESTION:

And here you're not drawing a line --

16

one of the lines was similar conduct and in the same

17

State, but in the automobile, automobiles, we're a very

18

mobile society, so I don't think -- well, perhaps you are,

19

but you said this is, we draw a line around Utah, but

20

suppose the driver who was insured by State Farm was from

21

California, or from New York, where you get more than

22

seven incidents out of 14 years?

23

MS. BIRNBAUM:

But the question here was, was

24

there a bad faith failure to settle?

That is the conduct.

25

If there was evidence of bad faith failure to settle in

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other States, that could come in on reprehensibility.

2

That could inform the jury in some way, and under BMW v.

3

Gore, you said that that kind of conduct, similar conduct

4

in BMW was identical conduct.

5

QUESTION:

6

Well then, then you have no concern

with punishing for acts that took place out of State?

7

MS. BIRNBAUM:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. BIRNBAUM:

No, I --

You're abandoning that, or -We have not gotten to the ratio

10

of the comparable penalties questions under BMW.

11

just focusing on reprehensibility.

12
13

QUESTION:

We were

What is similar conduct in BMW, to

give some feel for what you mean by similar conduct?

14

MS. BIRNBAUM:

15

QUESTION:

Exactly what the Court --

Selling cars with scratches on them,

16

or is it selling -- what about, you sell cars with

17

defective, knowingly, with defective clutches?

18

be similar?

19

MS. BIRNBAUM:

20

QUESTION:

21

No, it would not.

It would -- it has to be cars with

scratches, it has to be the same thing?

22

MS. BIRNBAUM:

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. BIRNBAUM:

25

Would that

in that case.

It's the conduct --

Wow.
It was the conduct that occurred

In that case there was a failure to tell

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consumers --

2

QUESTION:

The car had a scratch.

3

MS. BIRNBAUM:

4

QUESTION:

-- that the car had a --

So the only cases that are relevant

5

are other cases where BMW pawned off cars that had

6

scratches?

7

but not scratches?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

8
9

It could pawn off all sorts of other defects,

If you open it up to all kinds of

other defects, then you're opening it up --

10

QUESTION:

You lose, right.

11

MS. BIRNBAUM:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. BIRNBAUM:

You're opening it up --

-- to the kind of thing that can

14

happen here, especially if it gets punished.

15

there was a million dollars' worth of compensatory

16

damages, a substantial number, and this verdict was 145

17

times that.

18

punishing all of this extraterritorial, dissimilar, and in

19

many instances, lawful conduct.

That could only be considered because it was

QUESTION:

20

In this case

I thought we had just gotten off the

21

extraterritorial -- where you said it wouldn't make any

22

difference if the insured was from California or from

23

Utah.

24

MS. BIRNBAUM:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

25

The really important thing here is that the Utah

1

Supreme Court -QUESTION:

2

Excuse me.

3

we are on the out of State.

4

to that under another --

5

MS. BIRNBAUM:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. BIRNBAUM:

I don't understand where

You say you're going to get

Yes.

-- prong?
Under ratio and comparable

8

penalties, Your Honor.

Because this Court has said that

9

you could introduce extraterritorial conduct, similar,

10

past conduct with regard to reprehensibility, but there

11

are three guideposts in Gore, and the Utah Supreme Court

12

ignored the other two guideposts.

13

to the ratio guidepost, this Court has repeatedly said

14

there has to be a reasonable relationship, reasonable

15

ratio between the penalty, the punishment, and the harm to

16

the plaintiff: not the harm to others, not the harm to the

17

community at large, not the harm to all of the consumers

18

that dealt with State Farm, as the Utah Supreme Court held

19

and found, and -QUESTION:

20

Of course, when it came

So how do we measure that?

How do we

21

measure the ratio, the reasonable relationship of the

22

penalty?

23

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Here, Your Honor, there was a

24

compensatory damage award of a million dollars.

25

a substantial compensatory award.

That was

The ratio that would be

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable with regard to a million dollars could not be

2

145 to 1.
QUESTION:

3

Except that, you know, we say that

4

you can't take into account harm to others, but you can

5

take into account harm to others so long as that is done

6

under the rubric of reprehensibility.

7

MS. BIRNBAUM:

8

QUESTION:

9

As long --

If you've done the same thing to

other people, you can be punished more.

Now, you may find

10

a significant difference between punishing you for what

11

you did to the other people, and punishing you more for

12

what you did to this person, because it is rendered more

13

reprehensible because of what you did to other people, but

14

I don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

15

But even if there is a ratio,

16

what reprehensibility does is put you on the continuum of

17

blameworthiness, and this Court has said previously that 4

18

to 1 is close to the line.

19

because economic damages was small, and you looked at

20

potential harm as well as the realized harm to the

21

litigant there.

In TXO it permitted 10 to 1

22

Here, he had substantial compensatory damages.

23

In addition, if you look at the third guidepost in Gore,

24

you have comparable penalties and sanctions for comparable

25

conduct.

That's how that is defined.

15

1

What was the conduct here?

2

settle within policy limits.

3

it was --

4

QUESTION:

It was a failure to

It wasn't intentional tort;

May I just suggest an analogy?

This,

5

in a way this reminds me of the argument we heard last

6

week -- maybe it was last session -- about the three

7

strikes law in California; that you're not necessarily

8

punished for the other things you did, but you can take

9

into account your prior crimes even in other States in

10

order to justify a more severe penalty for what you've

11

done here.

12

side makes is that this is a very large company, and the

13

board of directors doesn't hear about a $100-million

14

punitive damage award down in Texas, and therefore you've

15

got to at least give them enough money so the board of

16

directors will know they ought to take corrective steps.

17

And isn't it -- part of the argument the other

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Could I just first answer this

18

$100 million punitive damage award, because I think that

19

really shows where the Utah Supreme Court is going.

20

was no judgment.

21

failure to settle.

It had to do with an uninsured

22

motorist coverage.

The case was settled for pennies on

23

the dollar.

This had nothing to do with bad faith

1

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Pennies.

Pennies.

Unfortunately

2

I couldn't put into evidence the amount because there as a

3

confidentiality agreement, but that case had nothing to do

4

with the kind of conduct here.
QUESTION:

5

You cannot --

No, but I suppose to the extent it's

6

relevant it is, that you need an awfully big award against

7

an awfully big company, because you want the company

8

itself to take corrective steps, and if this $100 million

9

award isn't even called to the attention of the board of

10

directors, maybe that says you needed a larger award than

11

would otherwise be justified.
MS. BIRNBAUM:

12

Your Honor, I think if you look

13

at this, this was a jury award that was never made into a

14

judgment.

15

runaway verdict in a place.

What's your response?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

The answer to that is, first of

all, surplus was the wrong number to ever focus on.

That

1

money is accounted for, and there are some very good

2

briefs, amicus briefs that talk about surplus.

3

There was never a profit from underwriting in

4

this particular instance, and the fact that the company

has surpluses, that's to pay out claims.

MS. BIRNBAUM:

11

Yes.

And he for a period of time the

client thought that he'd have to pay $136,000 out of his

This is a very big company, and

17

Now, what's your response?

18

MS. BIRNBAUM:

The response to that, Your Honor,

19

is there's nothing in this record -- first of all, that

kind of ratio is totally unreasonable and out of

21

proportion to the harm to the plaintiff.

22

QUESTION:

That's not my question.

My question

23

is, there is a claim.

Even if it's out of proportion to

24

the harm, we've got to wake these people up at State Farm.

Now, they get wakened up by this 145 million judgment,

suffice.

Maybe we have to send them to jail.

MS. BIRNBAUM:

(Laughter.)

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Well, that's what --

That's what the Supreme Court of

5

Utah said, even though it's not in their statute.

Can you

6

imagine, on fair notice, when we talked about fair notice,

7

that you could go to jail for a failure to settle one case

8

in the State of Utah?

QUESTION:

Did this jury --

10

QUESTION:

It didn't have authority to send them

11

to jail though, did it?

12

MS. BIRNBAUM:

13

QUESTION:

No, they didn't.

You know, but you're making -- I

14

think you're making two arguments.

15

the argument that you started with, and that is, evidence

16

was improperly admitted, acts in other States were

17

improperly considered, acts unlike failure to settle were

18

improperly considered.

19

First, you're making

Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you

21

going to get to the point you're arguing now.

22

assume you lose on that.

What do we put

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

between 4 and 145?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

2

I think you've already put that

3

in your opinions in this Court already, and that is that

4

there has to be a relationship between the amount of the

5

punitive damages and the compensatory harm to the

6

plaintiff.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, I know that, and the question

8

is, is 4 times the relationship appropriate, and 145 is

9

not?

10
11

And how about 80, and 60, and 20?

How do we grapple

with that?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

Well, I think you grapple with

12

that only by looking at the three guideposts that you've

13

already put forth, and it could be 4, it could be 5, and

14

some courts have even held 10, but most of the courts that

15

have followed your jurisprudence have held that 3, or 4,

16

or 5 is close to the line.

17

QUESTION:

Is the point of your argument

18

ultimately -- you're not saying this, but I mean, if we

19

accept the way you're going, are we really going down the

20

road to saying, look, at some point we've got to leave

21

this in a less protean state, and we've got to pick a

22

number, and is that our business to do?

23

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Now, we're not asking you to put

24

a bright line.

It would be helpful, but I don't think

25

this Court is prepared to do that.

22
Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

Well, would the bright line be

2

helpful if we said, up to -- pick a number -- 10 times

3

will be usually accepted unless that is not adequate

4

enough to compensate the plaintiff for the wrong that was

5

done to him?

6

MS. BIRNBAUM:

That would be an excellent way of

7

drawing the line, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

9

our Bill of Rights?

10

You get this out of what provision of

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Your Honor, we get it out of due

11

process, the two bedrock provisions called due process and

12

federalism.

Federalism, comity, States' rights.

QUESTION:

But as far as --

14

QUESTION:

It's not specific, is it?

MS. BIRNBAUM:

No, we're not suggesting that.

thought it was a good idea, however.

19

QUESTION:

Ms. Birnbaum, I'd like you to clarify

20

your position on what has been called

21

extraterritoriality --

22

MS. BIRNBAUM:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- because I thought today that you

24

were very forthright with the Court.

You said no, you're

25

not going to make a distinction whether the plaintiff

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

comes from California or New York rather than Utah.

2

MS. BIRNBAUM:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

So you can't just draw a line around

4

the State of Utah and say, that's the relevant State.

5

you tell us a supplemental brief was calling attention to

6

a case where there was a specific request to make that

7

kind of charge.

8

request in this case, as far as I can tell.

You made no such, State Farm made no such

But

Yes, and instruction number 46, which

I looked for, was the closest thing.

18

MS. BIRNBAUM:

19

QUESTION:

That's right --

That talks about both compensatory

and punitive damages, that you should base it on State

It would be the same thing if the

MS. BIRNBAUM:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Let me just mention one other part of the

11

guideposts which I think are very relevant here, and that

12

is comparable penalties for comparable misconduct, and

13

here it is uncontroverted that the penalty that the Utah

14

courts or the Utah system could have placed on State Farm

15

for an act, for a single act of bad faith failure to

16

settle, which was at stake here, was $10,000.

17

Yet when the Utah Supreme Court examined that

18

guidepost from the Court, it looked at the scheme.

19

looked at all of the nationwide conduct to determine that

20

1) you could be -- you would have to disgorge all your

21

profits or you could be imprisoned, which was not correct

22

anyhow under the Utah statute.

But if you restate the guideposts that you have

24

already come down with, and you make it clear that we're

25

talking about conduct that was permitted to the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plaintiffs, that we're talking about reasonable ratios

2

that had to do with the plaintiff's wrong, not harm to

3

others, not harm to all of those in Utah -- in fact, if

4

you look at the bad faith failure to settle issue, there

5

was no one in the State of Utah that was harmed by that

6

kind of conduct.

Justice Breyer, for a short time with execution, and

8

that -- and there was no reason, there was no reason to

9

deter that kind of conduct because there was no conduct in

There was nobody that was even subject,

10

the future, after the Campbell case, that that even came

11

close to.

12

So I think that if you focus on those factors,

13

those guideposts that you elucidated to in Gore, and make

14

them stronger, that would be sufficient for the lower

15

courts to do their job in doing a meaningful -- meaningful

16

appellate review, not the kind of review here that was

17

based on questionable conclusions and improper predicates.

1

recognize the case that, though I didn't try, I read the

2

transcript in, from hearing Ms. Birnbaum's description.

3

She says that the conduct involved in this case was simply

4

the failure to settle.

5

intentional tort.

6
7
8
9

It wasn't, she says, even an

Well, the Court's --

QUESTION:

Well, that was the sole ground of

liability, was it not?
MR. TRIBE:

The sole ground of original

liability was objectively unreasonable failure to settle,

10

but phase 2, which was held at the insistence of

11

plaintiffs, who wanted -- of the defendants who wanted to

12

bifurcate, phase 2 focused on the question of whether

13

there was an intentional tort, and there was found to be

14

fraud; and the court, the trial court affirmed the

15

judgment partly on the ground of intentional fraud; and

16

the fraud, and it's not a surprise really to the lawyers

17

for the defendants, because they made it clear in their

18

opening statement that they understood the whole theory of

19

this case to be that the insurance policies that were

20

being sold by State Farm, which led people to think that

21

in first and in third party cases the claims adjuster

22

would try to do a reasonably objective job of satisfying

23

the claim if possible, in fact weren't bad at all.

24

There was a clandestine cap that was imposed by

25

this innocuous-looking bureaucratic PP&R program that was

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thoroughly documented and that was imposed from

2

headquarters, documented elaborately by hundreds of

3

examples; and it's true, some of them came from other

4

States, and I will get to that; but they were all just

5

illustrative, because it came from headquarters in

6

Bloomington, and it was a directive --

7
8

QUESTION:

I take it the policy is, pay as

little as possible, even if fraud is necessary?

9

MR. TRIBE:

And, in fact, it was necessary here.

10

That is, they made up things.

11

QUESTION:

All right, I see that, but what's --

12

MR. TRIBE:

They made up the fact that -- they

They doctored the file.

defamed this dead person and said that he was speeding to

14

meet a pregnant girlfriend, who didn't exist.

15

findings that they systematically shredded, and destroyed,

16

and fabricated documents for two decades in order to cover

17

up the fact that they were not selling what they were

18

pretending to sell.

19

There were

And it was found in this case clearly, and then

20

again de novo by the Utah Supreme Court, that this policy,

21

which was clandestine and then covered up, was a policy

22

that had persisted for two decades, which they even now

23

seem unwilling to acknowledge.

QUESTION:

I'm sure you're going to get to it,

2

but one can infer -- maybe it's not entirely clear -- that

3

all of this was established, and there are very, very

4

many, many bad, bad deeds done in all parts of the United

5

States, but that the $145 million is in large part

punishment for what was done outside of Utah.
MR. TRIBE:

8

Stevens.

Oh, I don't think so, Justice

I do plan to get to that.
QUESTION:

9

The second point that relates to that

10

is that when the Supreme Court of Utah made the comparison

11

to what the criminal penalty might have been, they had to

12

be referring to more than what could have been imposed in

13

Utah.
MR. TRIBE:

14

No, Justice Stevens, what they said

They referred among other things to the Utah

15

was this.

17

violation; and there were in their view thousands of

18

individual instances of wrongfully denied benefits.

20

MR. TRIBE:

In Utah, yes, because they didn't

claims that is being drawn for the convenience of State

23

Justice Kennedy, this is very important.

In

6

this particular case, it was the failure to settle a case,

7

and it was a fraudulent failure to settle a case, not just

8

a random accident, but it was pursuant to exactly the same

9

policy, capping the average amount that a given claims

10

agents puts out in terms of State Farm money, that is used

11

in these other instances.

It was exactly the same policy.

In this case, it was because this fellow named

12

Bill Brown wanted to move to Colorado, and because he did,

and because he was close to his quota, and this is all in

policy to serve as a justification for a $145-million

the BMW case, that the Constitution, indeed the Magna

19

Carta says that you should not take life, liberty, or

against the monthly quota -- you read the testimony of

Gary Fye at page 1375 and 1387 of the joint appendix.

13

Because they were up against the monthly quota, the people

at the receiving end who thought they had a claims agent

who was, as they call him, a good neighbor, in fact had

1

told the jury, I think consistent with this Court's

2

jurisprudence and with the history of punitive damages,

3

that they could consider the effect of State Farm's

4

behavior, quote, "on the lives of plaintiffs and of other

5

policyholders," and it's because, Justice Breyer, of what

6

you said in BMW that a lot of other people who are harmed

7

by these practices are not likely to be able to sue.

is, they're not going to make it.

Before they

One of the advantages -- there may

22

be down sides, but if we prevail, Justice Ginsburg, we're

23

prevailing on a theory that the practice we've identified,

24

which is quite specific, for 20 years of putting these

25

invisible caps that cheat the insured in all kinds of

cases throughout the State of Utah, there will no longer

2

be anyone who can recover for those harms, beyond

3

compensatory damages, because the penalty will have been

4

extracted.

5

QUESTION:

The question that's bothering me --

6

QUESTION:

Is that true in New York or Vermont?

7

I mean, you said in Utah there would be no one who can get

8

another $145 million --

9

MR. TRIBE:

I think if they've done this in

10

every State, then they should be exposed to the

11

possibility of punitive damages in other States.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TRIBE:

So you could multiple that by 50.
Well, you know, it seems to me, if

14

you look at the opinion that was delivered from the bench

15

by the district court after 2 months, in his own words --

16

they accuse us of writing his opinion.

17

In his own words, what he said was that absent a

18

punitive award, the problem of recurrence of their

19

misconduct is extremely high, the probability of

20

recurrence; because he saw the evidence that they never

21

stopped; and he said that even the $25-million award that

22

he felt constrained by State law, mistakenly, to give, he

23

thought would not suffice because -- and I'm now reading

24

from his December 19 opinion -- because the $25 million

25

may not be enough to offset the profit that they're likely

That is, every time they cheat the insured by --

is all based on what happened in Utah.

In the

Yes.
-- when they did get into out of

10

State evidence, what proportion, in your judgment, of that

11

evidence related to Utah, and what proportion related to

12

other States?

13

MR. TRIBE:

I think the overwhelming majority

14

related to Utah, and every time it came in dealing with

15

another State, contrary to what we heard, it was because

16

the door had been opened, and it was specifically found by

17

the trial court that they waived any objection to the

18

testimony in question, despite what we heard about --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

But you're telling me that over half

of the evidence related to Utah itself?
MR. TRIBE:

Yes, but let me tell you, Justice

22

Stevens, it was so uniform that the particular examples

23

were picked because they so nicely illustrated the way a

24

particular device like the use of non-OPM parts would

25

interact with the cap that was imposed.

It was nothing

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

12
13

Yes, but there must have been a lot

-- getting rid of all those records.
But they didn't destroy all the

evidence to have a trial go on this long.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, it's because -- part of what

was said by the trial court was that it took the

persistence of a David to bring this particular Goliath to

his knees.

19

cases, not with any cooperation on the part of State Farm.

State Farm kept saying, we don't have a PP&R policy.

21

and then we got rid of it in 1992; and we got rid of it

22

again in 1994; and yes, there's a PP&R policy, but it

23

doesn't actually set the cap on any particular claim.

He himself had Parkinson's disease.

They were part of the weakest of the herd, as

11

State Farm's policies put it, that they're picked on,

because they're less likely to fight back. But it happened

that these people did fight back, and it seems to me it's

That could be, but -I was referring to them, and my

problem is that in fact what you have is a system where if

you take, let's call it the most evil corporation in the

world, and I'm sure there are some such, and they commit a

very minor tort in respect to someone, pursuant to their

policy of being evil --

MR. TRIBE:

-- there is common law, there are

many, many sources of law; and it's disturbing in terms of

the picture of the law to have 12 people picked at random

to assess an enormous fine without standards other than,

23

"this defendant is evil," and I'm assuming he is evil.

24
25

MR. TRIBE:

Justice Breyer, first, it's not fair

to say that was the only standard.

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

-- to get you to say what the

standard was, if it is not that.
MR. TRIBE:

I thought this Court did a rather

6

good job in BMW.

7

when one has a repeat offender who even now

8

mischaracterizes its intentional tort, when one has a

9

repeat offender that obstructs justice --

10

Reprehensibility could hardly be higher

QUESTION:

But again, you're defining

11

reprehensibility quite without regard to the specific

12

injury imposed on the plaintiff.

13

MR. TRIBE:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well -You're defining -- you're giving a

report card to the entire company.
MR. TRIBE:

No, but Justice Kennedy, in TXO this

17

Court talked about the ratio not just of the harm that

18

actually befell the particular plaintiff, but of the

19

punitive damages to the harm that might have befallen that

20

plaintiff if the tortious plan had been carried to

21

completion.

22

Here, if it had been carried to completion the

23

home would have been taken, because a deal would not have

24

been struck in December of '84 -- of '84, and also in TXO,

25

and in other cases, you've spoken of the harm to the

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

larger community.

You've also spoken of the importance of

2

extracting the profit from tortious behavior.
QUESTION:

3

I think -- Justice Breyer touched on

4

this.

5

the image that this does to the judicial system when

6

corporations, businesses, people of substance want to use

7

the courts and they're deterred from doing it by the

8

threat of runaway punitive damages, and that is not good

9

for the legal system.

10

Part of the harm to the larger community here is

MR. TRIBE:

Justice Kennedy, I certainly agree

11

in principle; but to pick a case in which a corporation

12

has defied the legal system, has shredded documents, has

13

covered up its deliberate wrongdoing, has not even

14

bothered to pay attention to a $100 million award -- yes,

15

of course it wasn't reduced to a judgment, but the

16

evidence in this case is that that's not relevant.

17

was critical is that they had built a wall of deniability

18

so that no one in a decisionmaking capacity is informed of

19

punitive judgments.

What

20

Mr. Muskowski testified in this case that he

21

would not let anyone know, in a position of authority,

22

even of the punitive judgment in this case; and in their

23

reply brief they say, well, Mr. Mendoza had decisionmaking

24

authority, but if you look at the relevant pages in the

25

joint appendix, you'll see that that's not true.

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In the

1
2

colloquy it's clear that he did not.
What that means is that a company can surround

3

itself with an impregnable wall and in effect spit at the

4

legal system.

How good is that for its image?

5

Now, it may be that an ideal legal system might

6

not use juries for this purpose, but is it the mission of

7

this Court to redesign the legal systems of the 50 States?

8

15 States have signed an amicus brief here saying it's

9

important to them to be able to use punitive damages when

10

the regulatory and criminal justice systems haven't quite

11

caught up with whatever latest axis of evil is afoot in

12

the corporate world.

13

Is it really helpful to any of us to have a

14

corporation be able to defraud all of the people who rely

15

on it, who depend on it, and get away with paying simply

16

what harm they happened to cause in the one case when they

17

get caught?

18

It seems to me especially bizarre, especially

19

bizarre for State Farm to speak here proudly of the fact

20

that this is the worst case in history.

21
22

QUESTION:

about the proceedings here?

23

MR. TRIBE:

25

Can I ask one other question just

Yes.
The record is so large I didn't have

the whole thing completely in mind.

reduced the jury's award of $145 million to -- what was

it, $20 million?

appealed.

There was a cross-appeal by State

MR. TRIBE:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. TRIBE:

Well, did both sides appeal that?
Yes.
I see.

It wasn't clear to me.

That's right.

State Farm appealed

12

because it thought there should be no punitives.

13

even now they think it did nothing wrong.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TRIBE:

It seems

Yes.
And there was a cross-appeal by the

16

Campbells on the grounds that they thought it was a

17

mistake of State law to have reduced the punitives.

quite a shock if State Farm had been the only appellant

QUESTION:

And isn't there a certain irony in

2

that it was chopped down to $25 million, and then the Utah

3

Supreme Court, using this Court's case law, saying we

4

don't give the ordinary deference that we would give to

5

that judgment of the trial court, because the Supreme

6

Court had told us we must engage in de novo review, and

7

engaging in de novo review, we don't chop it down, we put

8

it back to where it was originally.

9

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in a

10

sense that looks ironic.

11

Leatherman came back in a boomerang, but I think really

12

the way I read the opinion of the Utah Supreme Court, they

13

applied Cooper in an even more vigorous way in general.

14

That is, they didn't just engage in de novo review of the

15

question of excessiveness.

16

of all the facts, so you have not just a jury, but a jury

17

and a trial court and a full appellate court.

18

It looks as though Cooper v.

They engaged in de novo review

The only fact on which they said they weren't

19

going to defer was a technical issue about the wealth of

20

State Farm, and the real reason they actually gave for

21

increasing the 25 to 145 was their conviction that the

22

trial court believed that 25 would not stop State Farm

23

from persisting in its practices, and that it was only

24

their own earlier suggestion that the ratio should matter

25

a great deal that had misled the trial court.

Well, in this case, sending them to

8

jail was an option that the Supreme Court of Utah

9

mentioned, and that State Farm doesn't seem to take very

10

seriously.

11

doesn't understand its own law.

There are provisions of

MR. TRIBE:

22

but the comparability standard asks, how serious an

23

24
25

But to your question, Justice Scalia, on ratio,
I think that instead of trying to come up with a number --

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

because I think suggesting any number would be so

2

arbitrary that it would do more damage to this Court than

3

good to the legal system.

4

idea of a serious crime.

5

number plucked from the air, and it would backfire,

6

because as the law and economics people are fond of

7

pointing out, any number you pick will then lead people to

8

sort of modify their behavior accordingly, and just

9

internalize the costs on a kind of bad man theory, and

10

what you really are trying to do is stop the behavior.

It's not like 6 months for the

We're not talking about negligence here.

11

We're

12

talking about something of which the optimal level is

13

zero.

14

covered up in this way is zero.

15

The optimal level of deliberate fraud and deception

The relevance of the ratio, I think, is simply

16

as one thing to look at.

17

you ask why is it so high?

18

back, it's so high because the ratio of the number of

19

people they hurt to the number who are going to be

20

motivated to sue and able to sue is very low.

21

very -- you know, a number -- a huge number will be hurt.

through that filter.

MR. TRIBE:

I suppose, but

there are ways of getting rid of frivolous lawsuits.
The point also is, it's hard -- if you see an

4

increase, Justice O'Connor, and if it is an increase that

5

gets anywhere, it might be because they stopped destroying

6

the evidence, because they stopped fabricating -- they've

7

so doctored the files, like the file in this case, to make

8

it look in any given case as though the report that they

give corresponds to the history of the case, and it's

10

awfully hard to sue successfully when the file has been

massaged and doctored.

that this is compensatory damages.

MR. TRIBE:

Then you shouldn't have said that.
Then the reprehensibility of what

was done to them is affected by, as this Court has said,

whether it was done as part of a schematic, systematic

form of predation.

MR. TRIBE:

I see.
And it was known very clearly the

day after BMW that a good bit of the evidence in this

case, because many of the examples of how this policy

7

worked, would come from other places, would not be Utah-

8

based.

the wall they built would come from Texas.

10

The $100-million verdict which would illustrate

They never once asked for an instruction

11

limiting matters to Utah, and I don't fault them for it.

12

It would have been rather bizarre to do so, because they

13

knew full well that we were not asking the Utah jury or

14

the Utah courts to punish them for what they did

15

elsewhere.

16

We were simply using what was done elsewhere

17

first to rebut their commissioners -- they brought in

18

commissioners from various States to testify that State

19

Farm never did anything wrong.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BIRNBAUM:

Thank you, Your Honor, I

appreciate that, because there are certain things that Mr.

Tribe said that I think we have to clarify.

for?
MS. BIRNBAUM:

was the instruction that I previously read to Justice

Ginsburg that they should look to the conduct toward the

Campbells, and that was the instruction.

Do you disagree with Mr. Tribe's

suggestion that over half the evidence related to Utah?
