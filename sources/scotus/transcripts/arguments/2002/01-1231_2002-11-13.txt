ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case, like Alaska's, is about fully

12

accurate, concededly true public record information about

13

convicted sex offenders that citizens of Connecticut and

14

the 50 other States need and deserve -- indeed, they

15

demand be made available and accessible -- so they can

16

make choices about how to protect themselves, their

17

families, and their children.

18

And each of the convicted sex offenders on this

19

registry has received a hearing, a full and fair hearing,

20

many of them a trial, all of them the full panoply of due

21

process rights and have been found guilty beyond a

22

reasonable doubt.

23

QUESTION:

In this case, General Blumenthal,

24

we're not talking about ex post facto.

25

about due process of some sort because the Second Circuit

3

We're just talking

1

said this couldn't be applied whether it was done

2

afterwards or before.

3

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

We are, indeed, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, talking only about the due process issue and only

5

about whether, first, the listing on this registry is

6

defamatory and, second, whether the defamation, if, in

7

fact, it exists -- and we say it doesn't -- is a violation

8

of the Due Process Clause in the way that it is imposed

9

here, that is, under Paul v. Davis, whether there is a

10

loss or alteration of right or status as a result of that

11

defamation --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

It's a procedural due process claim,

not substantive due process.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

The -- the claim has been a

15

procedural due process claim, although the United States

16

as amicus has raised -- and we welcome that it has

17

raised -- the substantive due process issue.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But --

We don't normally address issues

raised by amici, do we?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

I don't know whether the Court

21

is more hospitable to claims that may be raised by amici

22

from the United States Government, but it certainly is a

23

relevant issue to be addressed here because many of the

24

claims raised under the guise of due process really

25

involve line drawing and categories.

4

For example, the

1

question of which offenses should be listed on the

2

registry really is a legislative determination.
QUESTION:

3

Well, the Second Circuit's position

4

puts us -- decision puts us in a somewhat difficult

5

position.

6

have to say, procedural due process to protect what right?

7

So we have to go back and find out what the basic right

8

they're talking about is, and I suppose the narrow way to

9

do it is to look just to whether or not there's -- there's

It's a procedural due process opinion, and we

10

a Paul versus Virginia type of claim with this -- with

11

this -- with a stigma -MR. BLUMENTHAL:

12

Certainly that is the way

13

the -- the case comes to the Court, raising that issue,

14

and it's one that we believe merits reversal of the Second

15

Circuit.

16

agree so far as the issue of stigma is concerned -- that

17

the implication as reached by the Second Circuit is

18

correct, that is, that every person on this list is more

19

likely than the average person to be currently dangerous.

20

We think that implication is true.

21

information on this registry, in fact, is concededly true.

22

And there is differentiation among the different

We agree -- and I must say very emphatically we

Every bit of

23

registrants.

The differentiation occurs by the offense;

24

that is, the information that is listed as to when the

25

offense occurred, the nature of the offense, the number of

5

1

offenses enables the public, having this information

2

accessible and available, to make judgments about whether

3

that individual in fact may be dangerous.

4

course -QUESTION:

5

And of

May I ask you a question about your

6

system?

Last year we had a case that came, I think, from

7

Kansas, McKune, involving whether a person had to -- could

8

be, in effect, compelled to go into a sex offender

9

program.

Does your -- and that -- presumably the -- those

10

treatment programs do some good in preventing recidivism.

11

Does -- does your reporting system give the convicted

12

offender a chance to differentiate between whether he went

13

through such a program and one who did not?

14

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

There is --

Does it draw any distinction between

those two?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Justice Stevens, there is no

18

category of information on the registration, as it's made

19

available to the public, about whether there has been

20

treatment.

21

address, identifying factors --

22
23
24
25

The information provided is very simply

QUESTION:

So they treat one who had treatment

and one who had no treatment exactly the same.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

That is correct, so far as the

information provided to the public is concerned.

6

And the

1

reason, if I may presume to say it, may be that the

2

effectiveness of treatment may be problematic, and the

3

same is true with hearings on dangerousness.

4

unreliability of these hearings has been a very, very

5

substantial problem, and the kind of information that may

6

come to the public from such hearings or from information

7

about treatment may be as misleading as it is accurate in

8

many instances.
QUESTION:

9

The

Would you -- would you agree that

10

there is at least some subclass of cases here in which the

11

non-dangerousness could be shown in a way that probably

12

was highly accurate and did not involve the -- the

13

difficulties that you raise?

14

What I've got in mind is this.

The -- the

15

categories of individuals who are listed under the

16

Connecticut statute include young men who as teenagers had

17

intercourse with younger teenage girls.

18

standards of English usage, would say at the age of 25

19

that -- that a -- a young man like that is dangerous in

20

any sense that we would associate dangerousness with --

21

violent sex acts and things of that sort.

22

to be a -- a category, not merely a set of individuals who

23

may prove they're not dangerous, but a category that is

24

presumptively not dangerous in the sense that the others

25

are.

No one, by normal

So there seems

And yet, there is no way for them, in effect, to --

7

1

to get themselves declared ineligible for the -- for the

2

stigmatization that -- that goes on.
Why isn't there a due process problem that is

3
4

legitimately raised as at least to a category like that?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

5

There -- there is, in fact,

6

Justice Souter, a category of the registrants who are

7

excepted for the -- a -- a category of convicted offenders

8

who are excepted from the registry if, for example, they

9

are 18 or younger and they commit statutory rape, if the

10

victim is 13 to 16 years old.

11

making accessible to the public information -QUESTION:

12
13

There are exceptions for

What do -- what do they have to do to

get the exception?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

14

At the time of sentencing, that

15

finding is made by the sentencing court, or later, that

16

that kind of registration is not required by public

17

safety.

18

QUESTION:

What about the ones who have already

19

been sentenced?

20

carryover class that you pick up the minute the statute

21

goes into effect?

22

are the -- raising in -- in the prior case, the ones who

are raising the ex post facto kind of claim.

do about them?

25

In other words, the -- the -- sort of the

I mean, these -- these are the ones who

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

What do you

a determination that certain -- under certain

2

circumstances, the crime is not registrable, that is,

there is no requirement for registration.

the case as an example.

8

Is -- is that person, if convicted prior to the date of

9

the statute, subject to exception from the listing, and --

12

The 19-year-old boy the --

and how -MR. BLUMENTHAL:
the sentencing court.

There is a provision --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

15
16

They -- they could go back to

I see.
-- that someone who would fit

the exceptions can go back to the sentencing court.
QUESTION:

Does this -- does this category fit?

17

Let's take -- those ages will do fine, 19 and 14.

18

that fit within an excepted category?

19

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Does

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.

20

I'm -- I'm not sure that I followed the -- the specific

21

class that Justice Souter was referencing.

22

QUESTION:

You said that there are certain

23

categories of people who can be exempted from that, and I

24

asked if the hypothetical that Justice Souter raised --

25

that particular hypothetical -- fits within that exempted

9

1

or excepted class.

2

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

3

QUESTION:

I believe that it could.

It doesn't on my list here.

What it

4

says here -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong in the statute which

5

my law clerk looked up.

6

that you -- you get into the exception to go back to the

7

sentencing court if you committed the sexual intercourse

8

when you were under the age of 19 with a victim between 13

9

to 16 and you were 2 years older.

And it's

So I think that -- that Justice Souter's

10
11

She's usually right.

hypothetical was purposely created --

12

QUESTION:

Nineteen.

13

QUESTION:

-- so they didn't fit within that

14

exception.

And -- and I -- I suspect that we can find a

15

large number of people who would be convicted of statutory

16

rape who don't fit within this exception and who are,

17

therefore, thrown in.

18

question -- it would -- certainly would be mine -- is what

19

about those people.

And I think the point of his

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

20

And -- and that question really

21

is the more fundamental issue about legislative line

22

drawing and unquestionably --

23

QUESTION:

Well, before we get to line drawing,

24

I misunderstood your response to me I guess.

25

answer?

What is the

Are those people in my hypothetical exempted or

10

1

do they have a process by which they can be exempted or

2

not?

3

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

4

QUESTION:

Maybe I should --

Justice Breyer understands that they

5

would not be exempted from listing.

6

Is he right or isn't he?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

7

And I -- I guess --

I -- I believe that probably

8

they would not be exempted, although they could go back to

9

the sentencing court, and determine whether the

10

circumstances of that hypothetical and -- and -- I'm

11

not --

12

QUESTION:

But what is the category?

13

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

14

QUESTION:

But I had in mind all --

What is the category, General

15

Blumenthal, in which such a person might go back?

16

seem to be rather precise categories that are excepted

17

with an age range, and if you fall outside that age range,

18

there doesn't seem to be built into this scheme any

19

discretionary exercises.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

20

There

That is correct, Justice

21

Ginsburg.

And someone who was not within the exemption --

22

and -- the hypothetical may put that person outside it --

23

could not go back.

24

line, and it's done so because it has to draw lines

25

somewhere and has imposed that classification because it's

The -- the legislature has drawn that

11

1

judged it to be in the public interest to do so.
QUESTION:

2

Let's assume -- you know, we accept

3

the fact that line drawing has to be done and so do the

4

people on the other side of the case.

5

the fact is we've got at least some category which we can

6

identify on a categorical basis which is being stigmatized

7

as dangerous for a period of -- I guess, a minimum of 10

8

years.

9

not even claiming that you affirmatively have got to make

Their claim is that

And all they're asking for is a way out.

They're

10

a proof of dangerousness in the first instance with

11

respect to those.

12

procedural due process, there ought to be a way out and

13

there is none.

14

is to contest the fact that the State could let them have

15

the burden of getting out, and the State still won't do

16

it.

They are saying, as a matter of

That's not to contest line drawing.

17

What is the justification?

18

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

The justification is that the

19

information that is put on the registry is accurate.

20

stigma, if there is any stigma, results from the

21

conviction of that offense, and --

22

QUESTION:

No.

That

The

That is not -- I don't think

23

that's their argument.

Their argument is not that they

24

are -- are being subject to a stigma for 10 years because

25

they were convicted.

They are being subject to a stigma

12

1

for 10 years because the State of Connecticut is saying

2

through the Internet in -- in effect, that they are

3

currently dangerous.

4

conviction, the current state of dangerousness which is

5

stigmatizing.

6

That's the stigma, not the

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

With all due respect, Justice

7

Souter, the court of appeals did not find that the fact of

8

being on the registry means that every individual is

9

subject to that stigma.

10

QUESTION:

No.

What it means is what you have

11

just -- to begin with, what you just stipulated, that in

12

fact there is a higher probability, a -- a greater risk

13

of -- of dangerousness.

14

means of differentiation for any one person on the

15

register, then that probability judgment is going to be

16

applied in the public mind, naturally, to every person on

17

that unless there is a way to establish an exemption.

18
19
20

But if, in fact, there is no

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

There is differentiation

insofar as the crime itself is listed.
QUESTION:

There is, and yet the very fact that

21

the State chooses to list that crime is a clear indication

22

that the State thinks that people in that category of

23

crime deserve to be listed with others who are potentially

24

dangerous.

25

effect, has said to the public, you can't draw any clear

So the State's very categorical treatment, in

13

1

distinctions based on the particular crimes that we'll

2

also inform you of.

3

judgment.
QUESTION:

4

You've already made the categorical

Mr. Blumenthal, may I ask you whether

5

this statute has helped in any way in reducing sex crimes

6

in Connecticut?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

7

We -- we can't really say,

8

Justice O'Connor, at this point because the Internet

9

availability has been suspended by order of the court.

10

All of this information --

11

QUESTION:

How long was it in effect?

12

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

It was in effect for a couple

13

of years, and even then it was too early to make a

14

judgment as to whether or not it was having any

15

discernible effect statistically, and there's nothing in

16

the record on that point.
I -- I should report that there are now about

17
18

3,000 registrants and some 500 approximately have been

19

convicted again of a registrable offense.
The point here is, though, that all of this

20
21

information is public record information.

The requirement

22

and the obligation for registration existed before 1998.

23

In fact, it began in 1994.

24

25

separate from how the information is made available to the

So no status or right was

And the registration requirement really is

public, and that goes to the Paul v. Davis issue.
And with your permission, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd
like to reserve the balance of my time.

QUESTION:

Very well, General Blumenthal.

5

Mr. -- General Olson, we'll hear from you.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
General Blumenthal conveyed three very important

12

aspects of this case in his opening sentence.

13

he said the people of Connecticut seek access to

14

concededly truthful, public record and otherwise public

15

available information concerning convicted sex offenders.

16

These individuals have no constitutional right to conceal

17

these public truths from interested public citizens.

18

In essence,

The Second Circuit examined the registry and

19

said not only is the information about every individual

20

concededly true, but the registry -- and this is set out

21

verbatim in page 6 of Connecticut's -- the blue brief.

22

The Department of Public Safety has not considered or

23

assessed the specific risk of re-offense of any individual

24

prior to his or her inclusion within this registry and has

25

made no determination that any individual included in the

15

1

registry is currently dangerous.

2

QUESTION:

3

or on the Internet?

4

MR. OLSON:

5

QUESTION:

That's what it says on the registry

Exactly.
But you could skip that entirely.

6

You get -- this is on the -- it's not listed -- I can go

7

to the Internet and go directly to the person.

8

information -- this disclaimer -- is not associated with

9

the individual offender listing.

10
11

This

It's -- it's stuck in

the middle of a bunch of stuff before.
MR. OLSON:

Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg.

12

It is not repeated for every name in the registry, but

13

it's clearly set forth in the registry itself.

14

in italics.

15

It's put

And the -- and the State goes on to say,

16

individuals included within the registry are included

17

solely by virtue of their conviction record and State law.

18

The main purpose of providing the -- this data on the

19

Internet is to make the information more easily accessible

20

and available, not to warn about any specific

21

individual --

22

QUESTION:

Well, except for the fact that --

23

that the -- the State has made a judgment and it doesn't

24

deny it, that individuals who have been convicted of

25

crimes in the categories subject to the law, are as a

16

1

categorical matter more likely to commit them in the

2

future.

3

general population.

4

not, in its register, say, and by the way, this John Doe

5

is especially dangerous.

6

it's saying this John Doe is part of the category that we

7

think dangerous enough to list through the Internet.

8
9
10
11

They are more likely to be dangerous than the

MR. OLSON:

And so it's true.

The State does

But the State can't deny that

Well, what they do say is that the

public is entitled to and should make specific judgments
about specific individuals.
QUESTION:

But it can't.

I mean, it cannot do

12

that on the -- on the basis of what the State puts out

13

because all it knows, from what the State puts out, is the

14

category the person falls into.

15

MR. OLSON:

Precisely.

And the point that you

16

were making earlier, Justice Souter, is that there are

17

different types of crimes that may be of interest to

18

different individuals.

19

QUESTION:

If you have small --

All -- all of which, however, are

20

regarded as being within some -- above some threshold of

21

dangerousness or they wouldn't be listed on the Internet.

22

MR. OLSON:

Because they are -- they are

23

responding to the people's request in 50 States -- and the

24

people of the United States through the Congress -- to

25

make information available to us about people who have

17

1

been convicted of sex crimes.

2

QUESTION:

I'll grant you that, but have the

3

people of the 50 States also said, and we don't want there

4

to be any way out for someone who can prove that he is

5

either non-dangerous or -- or in a category which is

6

highly -- which is much less likely to be dangerous?

7

MR. OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

I mean, if the people said there's no

MR. OLSON:

If -- if -- there -- that's -- the

9

Well --

escape?

10
11

Federal statute allows the State to exercise judgment with

12

respect to the use of its resources with respect to this

13

public record, truthful information.
Now, the State of Connecticut -- the question

14
15

that you're raising, it seems to me, falls squarely within

16

the concept of a substantive due process challenge, not

17

a --

18

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't it -- it's also

19

squarely within procedural due process.

20

is saying you're putting a label on me, and that's okay if

21

you give me a way to get out of it.

22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

The -- the State

But the State -That's a procedural due process

challenge.
MR. OLSON:

The label that the State is putting

18

1

on is that you have been convicted of a sex crime and that

2

the -- and you must draw -- we have not decided that you

3

are dangerous.
QUESTION:

4

No, but that's where -- I mean, I

5

think that's where the -- the -- we're not sort of meeting

6

each other in the argument.

7

No question about it.

8

the State is saying something further.

9

saying people in these categories are likely to be more

The State does say that much.

But by this categorized treatment,
The State is

10

dangerous.

It's a -- it's the second statement that is

11

the gravamen of the problem that we've got here, not the

12

truthful first statement.
MR. OLSON:

13

Well, the -- the Court has said

14

repeatedly that the -- this Court will examine challenges

15

with respect to the -- the -- in that category on a

16

substantive due process basis if the classification is

17

reasonable -QUESTION:

18

Well, that's -- that's right there,

19

but that is not the challenge that's being made.

There's

20

no challenge being made here that the State cannot have a

21

register -- or a register that is -- is structured by

22

category.

23

you do that, there should be a due -- there should be a

24

procedural mechanism for somebody who can show that he's

25

not dangerous to get out.

The challenge that's being made here is that if

That isn't substantive due

process.
MR. OLSON:

2

Well, and -- and our submission is

3

that the determination -- and this Court has stated it as

4

recently -- recently as a year ago that sex offenders are

5

more likely to be recidivists than other categories of

6

individuals, but that that does not mean, Connecticut goes

7

on to say, that any individual is necessarily dangerous.

8

That classification is rational.

9

Now, it is also rational for Connecticut to have

10

determined, as it did, that we'll accord opportunities for

11

people to address in -- in certain circumstances the

12

nature of their conviction.
QUESTION:

13

But it's also rational for --

General Olson, can I ask you a

14

broader question?

15

for Connecticut to require every person in the category to

16

wear a badge that recited the information that goes on the

17

Internet?

18

Do you think it would be permissible

MR. OLSON:

We think that that would be a very

19

difficult situation, Justice Stevens, in that -- the --

20

and -- and I would be concerned about that.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. OLSON:

Why?

But --

What's wrong with that?

Well, because that requires the

23

individual to carry that notification himself to convey

24

the government's message.

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. OLSON:

It also requires that message to be

2

brought into every situation that the individual is

3

involved in.

4

minimally intrusive way of responding to a question that a

5

citizen may ask of a State and to which the citizen is

entitled to an answer.

question.

8

everywhere the individual goes.

The Internet is a reasonable and relative --

The citizen here has to ask the

It isn't carried around with the individual

And this is public record information.

9

As one

10

of the questions in the earlier argument implied, if a

11

private citizen -- Cox Broadcasting, for example --

12

decided to make this information available to the public,

13

it would be -- have an absolute constitutional right to do

14

so.

15

Connecticut cannot impart to its citizens the same

16

information that Cox Broadcasting would have an absolute

17

constitutional right to do so.

18

QUESTION:

It seems anomalous to suggest that the State of

It seems to us --

But nobody is -- nobody is saying it

19

can't.

Nobody is saying Connecticut can't do this.

All

20

they're saying is if Connecticut does it, they've got to

21

give us an -- an escape hatch.

22

MR. OLSON:

Well, it seems to me, Justice

23

Souter, that that conflicts directly with what the Court

24

said in Paul versus Davis, that in the first place, there

25

is not defamation here because it's a truthful imparting

21

1

of information.
QUESTION:

2

If -- if there is no potential for a

3

defamatory or stigmatizing statement, then there is no

4

case.

5

defamation here is -- is, with respect, it seems to me, to

6

try to avoid the question.

7

I agree with you.

MR. OLSON:

But simply to say there's no

Well, I don't think it is, but --

8

but even if it were defamation, it is not -- there is no

9

stigma plus, as this Court required in Paul versus Davis.

10

There's no confinement of liberty.

11

any individual on this list of a right to a job --

12
13

QUESTION:

There's no denial of

Is there stigma plus in Justice

Stevens' hypothetical, wearing the badge?

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

There may well be.
Why isn't there stigma plus then in

16

creating a -- in effect, a subclass of citizens who have

17

got to go through quarterly registration possibly for the

18

rest of their lives?

19

MR. OLSON:

It -- it -- we submit that that is a

20

minimal, reasonable way for the State to keep track of

21

people who have committed crimes and then --

22

QUESTION:

But, General Olson, suppose you look

23

at it as a stigma minus.

What about the hypothetical I

24

asked earlier about somebody who took -- a convicted felon

25

who took the -- the treatment program and survived it and

22

1

one who did not?

They're treated alike in this system.

MR. OLSON:

2

Yes, they are because the State has

3

made a determination, as have 49 other States and

4

Congress, that the people are entitled to certain public

5

record information.

6

QUESTION:

7

But it's -- it's incomplete

information as to some.
MR. OLSON:

8
9

That does not apply --

It's -- well, it is -- it is

incomplete information as to everyone, we submit.

But it

10

does -- it is complete information with respect to whether

11

individuals have been convicted of a sex crime.

13

citizens are entitled.

That is information to which the

In the eyes of a concerned public, every person

7

you just made?

8

11
12

MS. SADIN:

That -- that the public knows this

is a Megan's Law list?
QUESTION:

That -- that the public knows that --

what -- that they're -- that they're dangerous.
MS. SADIN:

The -- the message of dangerousness

13

comes from a number of sources, Your Honor.

14

that the purpose of this law, the declared purpose of this

15

law, repeated by petitioners and repeated by the lawmakers

16

who passed it, is to protect the public from recidivist

17

sex offenders, and particularly to protect the children

18

from such offenders.

19

The first is

The law is administered and the registry is both

20

put together and published by the State police.

21

police on the website state that it is their mission to

22

prevent crime and protect the public.

QUESTION:

The State

But they also say that it -- it --

24

they're not saying that anyone is dangerous on that same

25

website, don't they?

24

1

MS. SADIN:

They don't actually.

The disclaimer

2

does not say that everybody is not dangerous.

3

disclaimer says is that no dangerousness assessment is

4

made with respect to any individual.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. SADIN:

What the

Well, why isn't that good enough?
It isn't good enough because all it

7

says is what we already know, which is that nobody has

8

been assessed for dangerous or not.

9

by the repeatedly emphasized message to the public, which

And it's contradicted

10

petitioners themselves stressed so urgently below, that

11

the purpose of this law is to publish current, monitored

12

information taken from offenders so that it can be posted

on the Internet so the public will know what they look

14

like and where they live at all times.

15

compelling message.

16

QUESTION:

That sends a very

But that's not -- that's not -- I

17

think what I took the Chief Justice is asking -- I took --

18

and I'd have a similar question, that -- that their

19

response I think to the point that I was trying to make

20

with Justice Souter, that maybe this is overly broad

21

because let's imagine the 19-year-old who simply had

22

intercourse once with a much younger woman and obviously

23

is no danger.

24

public, consider every case on the merits.

25

saying whether it's dangerous or not.

Their response is, first, it says to the

25

We're not

1

Second, when the people in the neighborhood to

2

which the individual has moved look him up on the Net,

3

they'll see what he did, and people aren't idiots.

4

They'll understand that this is there because he fell

5

within the law.
And besides that, they say, it's too difficult

6
7

for us to draw finer lines.

At least the legislature

8

reasonably so could conclude.
So the question I had is, is there any objective

9
10

evidence that people do cause mistake -- the significance

11

of this 19- or 20-year-old boy having his name there?

12

we just doing that because we all know -- in quotes -- or

13

is there evidence of it?
MS. SADIN:

Are

There were -- the -- the court --

15

the district court's decision and the court of appeals

16

decision that affirmed it were based on rule 9(c)

17

statements, undisputed facts on summary judgment, and they

18

included the fact that this is commonly known as a Megan's

19

Law.

20

country knows that Megan's Law was passed in response to

21

the rape and murder of a child victim.

the public understands them.

Well, what is the constitutional

you're here on a constitutional claim, and I'm not sure

that there be a -- as there is in this case, a false

stigma.

24
25

And I think we have to go back to the
understanding and the basis of this law.

28

This is a law

1

which was designed to -- and the public knows it was

2

designed to -- protect the public from dangerous,

3

recidivist offenders, and that is not true with respect to

4

many of the people, perhaps most of the people -- we don't

5

know -- who are on this list.

6

QUESTION:

Not only --

A danger -- potentially dangerous.

7

I mean, the government doesn't have to make a -- a rock-

8

solid assessment that these people are dangerous.

9

isn't it enough for the government to say this is a

10

Why

category of people who may be dangerous?

11

MS. SADIN:

12

QUESTION:

The government says -And is that true?

Can the public act on it?

It is perfectly

true.

14

if it doesn't want to, it doesn't have to.

15

further assessment of whether, indeed, the may is -- is

16

close enough or -- or -- but -- I don't know why you

17

insist on saying that the -- that the State has said these

18

people are dangerous.

19

disclaimer, the most the State has said is that these

20

people may be dangerous.
MS. SADIN:

21

If it wants to, it can;
It may make

It seems to me, even without the

The State says -- with respect, the

22

State says more, but even if it said that these -- that

23

these people may be more dangerous than other people, that

too reduces people in the eyes -- in the eyes of the

It causes people to, as any injury to reputation

there are statistics which show that this -- that some

QUESTION:

MS. SADIN:

That is my judgment that

Well, there are two points --- based on a public record.
There are two points with respect to

17

that, Your Honor.

First of all, a private citizen would

18

not have the power, as the government does, to obtain

20

photographs and current addresses for posting, and there

21

is not the same government-imposed imprimatur.

QUESTION:

All -- the entire context of

Let -- let me give you that.

What's

7

bothering me -- and it may be I'm just missing something,

8

but if I am, I've missed it for a long, long time.

9

What has this to do with the procedural due

10

process claim?

11

doubting that it does is first there is -- there are some

12

laws that are so basic that they're not written anywhere,

not even in our cases.

3

and the only kind of clause I've ever seen that would make

4

that constitutionally impermissible is the Due Process

5

Clause in its substantive sense.

That's a different argument,

And my point is not simply a technical point,

6
7

for if you had focused on the argument, there would be a

8

record that would answer questions like the Chief

9

Justice's.

You would have been forced to create a record

10

that would have gone into all the State's reasons and what

not.

That's a long question.

But I'd -- it's at the

root of what's bothering me.
MS. SADIN:

I understand, Your Honor, and I

think -- let me see if I can respond to it sufficiently.
We are not asking -- first of all, let me begin

18

by saying the reason we don't consider it to be a

19

substantive due process analysis is that we're not trying

20

to expand the scope of the due process law to -- to

21

recognize some liberty that is not already recognized.

22

There is an interest in reputation if it is coupled with

23

Somebody who's on that list.

As far as anybody knows, he's

Your clients have had a

MS. SADIN:

The person on the FBI list has yet

to have a hearing on whether or not he was the person who

2

committed the crime, and presumably, Your Honor, if he

3

were not and if there were false information that -- that

4

led to his arrest, he would have a claim for -- for false

5

arrest.
QUESTION:

6

Exactly.

But just putting him --

7

putting his face out there tells the public, does it not,

8

this is a dangerous person you ought to be on the lookout

9

for.

10

He hasn't had any hearing on that.
MS. SADIN:

Yes, but he will.

That hasn't happened with respect to the

Why do you have to have an

violates the Constitution to apply this statute to me.

23

But that's not who you're representing.

MS. SADIN:

Don't we

No, but excuse me.

Are you claiming

that there's got to be a determination in advance before

that a person who is on the register who claims to be non-

So you're attacking only the notification.

24

MS. SADIN:

QUESTION:

Yes.
And your position on the notification

is not simply that a person should have an opportunity to

show that he or she should escape from this list, but that

3

the government has the burden before it puts -- posts

4

anybody to show that that person is currently dangerous.

5

Is that your position?
MS. SADIN:

6

No.

I am saying that there has to

of people who deserve to be posted.

MS. SADIN:

They're on the registry.

No.

And even under the Federal

17

Megan's Law -- let me point out that even under the

18

Federal Megan's Law -- that small category of people,

19

sexually violent predators, are not allowed to -- must --

20

must have process before the government is allowed to

21

monitor them every 90 days, as everyone on Connecticut's

22

registry is done.

23

in fact, those sexually violent predators fit within that

24

category.

25

There has to be a court finding that,

And even with respect -QUESTION:

So no one -- no one could be put

3

So what is the finding?

That they

MS. SADIN:

4

The -- the finding is that they fit

the definition of -- there -- there are a number of

6

criteria and there are expert -- expert testimony is

7

required, and so there are criteria.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Those people could be confined under

Hendricks, and then the law serves no -- no purpose at
all.
MS. SADIN:

11

But those -- there is not that kind

12

of confinement law in Connecticut, but there certainly

13

is -- there would have to be procedure in connection with

14

that.

15

There has to be procedure in connection with the sexually

16

violent predators who are -- who are regulated in that way

17

under the -- under the Federal Megan's Law.

18

And the point is this:

There was procedure in connection with Hendricks.

Even with respect to

19

those people who have committed violent crimes, there are

20

treatment mechanisms.

21

against Lile that -- that recidivism rates are

22

dramatically reduced by people who receive treatment.

23

This Court recognized in McKune

It is not difficult to provide these hearings.

24

There are dangerousness hearings done in every court in

25

every State.

In Connecticut as well, there are

42

1

dangerousness assessments conducted even within the

2

context of this Megan's Law, Connecticut's Megan's Law, in

3

connection with exceptions and exemptions to registration.
QUESTION:

4

Maybe the people of Connecticut don't

trust those dangerousness hearings.

Maybe the people of

the guesses of some psychiatrist.

MS. SADIN:

If there has been process in

no.

MS. SADIN:

It does actually, and you are

required to submit to photographs whenever and wherever

11

the State tells you to and at least every 5 years.

12

answer is yes.

that are -- about which the Attorney General says there is

20

no reliability, not only are they conducted under the

21

Federal Wetterling Act and in connection with the

22

exemptions and exceptions under Connecticut's act, but

23

there are a number of States with already streamlined,

24

well-positioned systems who conduct these kinds of

hearings and who provide process.

46

There has been no

QUESTION:

They are

Citizens may not trust them.

6

Citizens have seen too many of these hearings that result

7

in the release of people who turn out to be dangerous.

8

Why -- why do you insist that the State must tell

9

citizens, we're not going to give you this information

10

because we have determined that the person is -- is not

11

dangerous and therefore you don't have to worry about it?

12

MS. SADIN:

But it isn't a question of just

13

giving the public truthful information.

The issue is

14

telling the public that these are people who need to be

15

monitored.

16

dangerous and they -- and you may not, but they are.

17

is why we are doing this to them.

So how can something that you say you're not

MS. SADIN:

Because they are integrally related.

Remember, my understanding of the stigma plus test is that

8

it was meant to distinguish just plain defamation cases

9

from those which really were Fourteenth Amendment claims

10

based on something the government was doing to you.

11

plus here is that the government requires you, on pain of

12

felony conviction, to provide the personal information

13

that then is published.

14

creates a new class of citizen, a second class of citizen,

15

which has different obligations from other citizens and

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Following Justice Ginsburg's question, there

really is no plus here.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The point is the registry has not

the requirement in the law that there be Internet

11

that is utterly lacking here.

12

And

The supposed harms -- there's nothing in the

13

record about housing, employment, any other harm that

14

results from this supposed stigma, and the stigma itself,

15

to go to the Chief Justice's question, has to be false in

16

order to constitute defamation.

17

Codd v. Velger, and that is plainly not true here because

18

all of this information, particularly as to the convicted

19

offense, is absolutely truthful and leaves to

20

Connecticut's citizens to make the judgment about whether

21

or not it indicates dangerousness.

22

This Court said so in

The disclaimer -- to clear one other point --

23

very specifically says not only that no assessment has

been made, but also that the publication or inclusion of

There's a specific disclaimer as to
