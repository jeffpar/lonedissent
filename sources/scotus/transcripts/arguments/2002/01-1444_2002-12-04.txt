ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit held in this case that

12

petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified

13

immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that

14

his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and

15

Fourteenth Amendments.

16

mistaken.

17

We believe that ruling to be

First, there was no constitutional violation at

18

all on these facts.

19

constitutional right implicated, that right was not

20

clearly established in the particularized sense required

21

by this Court's qualified immunity cases.

22

could not reasonably have known that what he was doing

23

violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit

24

should, therefore, be reversed.

25

QUESTION:

But second, if there was a

Officer Chavez

May I ask this question on that point

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that you addressed before you get through?

2

thought at the time of the questioning that the

3

material -- the answers would be used in evidence later

4

on, and he knew that it would have been a violation of the

5

Constitution to use those answers later on.

6

entitled to qualified immunity then?

7

MR. ROBBINS:

Supposing he

Would he be

Yes, because the Constitution --

8

well, because the first inquiry would be has the

9

Constitution been violated.

10

QUESTION:

Whether he thought --

But your -- I'm just directing my

11

question at -- you sort of said even assuming a

12

constitutional violation, he nevertheless is entitled to

13

good faith immunity.

14

the facts I've just granted, including an assumption that

15

the -- it would have been a constitutional violation to

16

use the evidence.

17

And I'm saying, well, assume the --

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think -- I think the --

18

the answer is that while -- while he might have believed

19

that the Constitution would in time be violated, because

20

he could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he

21

couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a

22

Fifth Amendment violation.

23

get to the question of clearly established if there's no

24

established constitutional violation at all.

25

QUESTION:

So the point is you don't even

But we -- we do somehow extend the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Fifth Amendment protection to the period before the actual

2

introduction of the evidence in a criminal trial.

3

to say, we -- we permit a witness to refuse to answer

4

unless the witness is given -- is given immunity from

5

prosecution.

6

the Fifth Amendment has some antecedent application before

7

the evidence is actually --

Now, how do you explain that, unless somehow

8

MR. ROBBINS:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

-- introduced at trial?

MR. ROBBINS:

10

That is

I -- I think you've put it exactly

11

right.

12

say, it applies prior to the moment at which it's actually

13

violated.

14

a way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is.

15

That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is

16

concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a

17

simple deposition.

18

use in a criminal case.

19

because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to

20

ensure that the right is protected later.

21

It has some antecedent application.

That is to

The premise is we need to ensure against -- in

QUESTION:

No one would suggest that that is a
But we allow you to assert it

Well, suppose in a civil case, the

22

judge orders the witness confined to custody until he

23

testifies in violation of what we can say in common

24

parlance is his Fifth Amendment right to self-

25

incrimination.

Is that not a violation then and there

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

to -- to confine the -- the defendant until he testifies?
MR. ROBBINS:

I think it is consistent with a

3

body of well -- well-developed law that to penalize

4

someone, particularly through that kind of a sanction, for

5

the assertion of a right is in the nature of a -- sort of

6

an unconstitutional condition.

7

established body of law that says --

8

QUESTION:

And there's a well-

I -- I don't know that we usually

9

talk about a violation as an unconstitutional condition.

10

We -- we would say, Your Honor, I want my client released

11

because you are violating his Fifth Amendment rights.

12

MR. ROBBINS:

13

QUESTION:

14

real sense you are.

15

But I -- I --

And I think in a very realistic --

MR. ROBBINS:

Yes.

I -- I think there is a body

16

of case law that says that if you are punished for the

17

assertion of a right, then under the Constitution you can

18

be relieved of that coercion.

19

However -- but let me be clear -- the actual

20

violation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text

21

of the Fifth Amendment says.

22

not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case.

23

I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the

24

holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is

25

inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does,

It says that your right is

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise

2

incriminating statement because in Murphy against the

3

Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that

4

the State court was correct in requiring the witness to

5

testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected

6

him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment

7

itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into

8

giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be

9

used against you.

10

And my central submission on the Fifth Amendment

11

point -- and of course, this is before we even get to the

12

question whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has

13

qualified immunity.

14

that you don't even have to get to that point because the

15

fail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that

16

Mr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in

17

a criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --

18

Our central submission on this is

QUESTION:

What -- what in your opinion in the

19

Constitution prevents a policeman from going and beating

20

up a witness?

21

MR. ROBBINS:

22

QUESTION:

The Fourteenth Amendment.

So, the Fourteenth Amendment means

23

that you could -- in other words, your -- your client

24

could have violated the Fourteenth Amendment if -- other

25

things being equal --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBBINS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Well --

-- because he was a witness.

He gets

at least -- at least the suspect --

4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- gets the same pre-trial protection

6

as a witness would, and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents

7

coercion being used against a witness who doesn't want to

8

testify.
MR. ROBBINS:

9

Well, let's be clear.

It doesn't

10

prevent all coercion.

It prevents a subset of coercion

11

that shocks the conscience for purposes of the -- the

12

substantive component of due process.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROBBINS:

15
16

The substantive due process.
Yes, Justice O'Connor.

That's

correct.
But -- but I think it is important that we not

17

torture the language of the Fifth Amendment to accommodate

18

the worry that police officers will torture witnesses

19

because that concern is completely -- can be completely

20

accommodated, and routinely is in the courts of appeals,

21

under the aegis of the --

22

QUESTION:

You're not saying -- those things

23

that would violate the Fifth Amendment weren't introduced

24

into trial do violate the Fourteenth Amendment for the

25

similar reasons.

8

1

MR. ROBBINS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Well, I mean, could you say -Yes.

-- that those things -- you could say

that.

6

MR. ROBBINS:

7

QUESTION:

8

I'm sorry.

Yes.

You -- you could say --

All right.

Then why didn't he

violate the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. ROBBINS:

9

Well, he -- well, again, let me --

10

I -- I

11

a qualified immunity case, I always want to drop the

12

footnote that we have an extra layer of protection here

13

arising from the fact that none of these propositions

14

could have been -- none of the propositions adverse to us

15

could plausibly be said to be clearly established within

16

the right sense of the term.

17

want to answer that, but I -- I -- because this is

Getting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did

18

not violate the substantive component of the Due Process

19

Clause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns,

20

including did the acts shock the conscience.

21

committed with the intent to harm the witness in the sense

22

required by Sacramento against Lewis?

23

Were they

The failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case

24

with respect to the substantive due process analysis was

25

that it thought that any interrogation which would render

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at

2

trial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding

3

substantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable

4

under section 1983.

5

QUESTION:

That's just wrong.
Mr. Robbins, going back to the Fifth

6

Amendment self-incrimination privilege, I take it the

7

thrust of your argument is that a police officer who fails

8

to give Miranda warnings quite deliberately, doesn't say

9

you have a right to remain silent, doesn't say any of the

10

rest of it, never commits a violation of 1983 unless and

11

until there's attempt to use the information in court.

12

you can say, police officer, you're not required to give

13

Miranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony

14

in court.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. ROBBINS:
to that is yes.

So

I am saying -- I think the answer

The -- the --

QUESTION:

So that the Miranda is -- is not an

obligation of the police officer.
MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I respectfully beg to differ,

20

and I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence

21

of the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in

22

the green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe

23

the Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red

24

herring, and let me say why.

25

The sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda

2

cannot be used in the direct case of the government.

3

That's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you

4

get the statement struck in the direct case for the

5

government.

6
7
8

QUESTION:
no 1983 penalty.

But there -- you're saying there is

The penalty is you can't --

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I think there is no 1983

9

penalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because

10

you don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the

11

evidence never comes in, when the statement is never

12

offered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to

13

be -- send a signal to police officers that they should

14

violate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion

15

I think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important

16

reason and it's this:

17

you run a serious risk that the failure to give those

18

warnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the

19

Fifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry.

20

which is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is

21

unusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment,

22

derivative use.

23

Kastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was

24

independently derived, which is, as the Court said in

25

Kastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet.

If you don't give Miranda warnings,

And a statement

The government then has to put on a

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice

2

Ginsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately

3

violating Miranda simply because the violation will not

4

cause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation.

5

QUESTION:

I -- I just have to tell you, I -- I

6

can see your -- your point on Miranda.

Miranda is an

7

exclusionary rule.

8

Amendment is -- is treated in that way because of the

9

questions we've initially covered.

But I'm not sure that all of the Fifth

10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

If -- if you beat the defendant to

12

get the defendant -- to get the confession, it seems to me

13

there's a very strong argument that that is a Fifth

14

Amendment violation --

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

I think --

-- A Self-incrimination Clause

violation.
MR. ROBBINS:

I think -- respectfully, Justice

19

Kennedy, I think there is a wealth of this Court -- this

20

Court's cases that cannot be reconciled with the

21

proposition that coercing a statement is enough by itself

22

to constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.

23

QUESTION:

All right.

You -- I think you could

24

say after -- after 30 years or 50 years of -- of

25

jurisprudence, policemen know they're not supposed to beat

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

up suspects or the -- the equivalent.

2

say, all right, at this point, I would think that does

3

shock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession

4

out of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it

5

Fourteenth or Fifth.

6

And -- and you can

But then the question here would be, why in

7

heaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain,

8

or he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get

9

out of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he

10

continues to press and then says, well, you're going to

11

get your treatment after you confess -- not confess --

12

after -- after you answer my question.

13

doing?

14

treatment, you'd better -- you better say something,

15

et cetera, et cetera.

16

beating somebody up?

17

Then we'll treat you.

MR. ROBBINS:

What were you

He says, you want your

Why isn't that the equivalent of

Well, let me attempt, if -- if I

18

might, Justice Breyer, to -- to very quickly answer

19

Justice Kennedy's question.

20

the Ninth Circuit held that it's enough under the Fifth

21

Amendment simply to coerce a statement that would

22

otherwise be incriminating cannot be reconciled with

23

Murphy and with the -- with Balsys, with the immunity

24

cases, with all the cases that stand for the proposition

25

that so long as the use immunity has not been compromised,

I -- I think the belief that

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you do not yet have a substantive Fifth Amendment

2

violation.

3

To turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I

4

acknowledge that there is coercion in this case.

5

don't -- we don't blanch on that.

6

the facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the

7

reality is this.

8

very important piece of information under extraordinarily

9

exigent circumstances.

10
11
12
13

QUESTION:

Well, was this tried below with a

Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim?
MR. ROBBINS:

I don't know that it was

denominated substantive due process.
QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

18

There was coercion and

This officer was there to find out a

We

I think --

Is that in the case?
I --

I mean, is it open to resolution on

that basis?
MR. ROBBINS:

There's -- there's no question

19

that the Ninth Circuit decided a Fourteenth Amendment due

20

process question.

21

substantive versus procedure.

22

suggest --

I don't think they -- they labeled it

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

QUESTION:

And indeed, as we

Well, if --- they conflated the two.

-- if -- if we think the facts here

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

show sufficient coercion to rise to the level of a

2

violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth

3

Amendment, should the judgment be affirmed --

4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ROBBINS:

No.

-- but on a different basis?
The judgment must be reversed,

7

first, because there is not even a suggestion that the

8

intent to harm requirement under Sacramento against Lewis

9

has been satisfied.

And under this -- in this kind of a

10

case, you cannot have a substantive due -- due process

11

violation without that.

12

argued that that Sacramento against Lewis --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

No one before you today has

What is -- what is the source of the

substantive -- of the intentional harm requirement?
MR. ROBBINS:

Is that -- the source I -- I

16

suggest is the -- the principles this Court articulated in

17

Sacramento against Lewis for police conduct that's taken

18

in enormous haste where -- where there is not the

19

opportunity for a second chance.

20

But let me go -- there's a terribly important

21

thing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in

22

answer to your question.

23

fundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I

24

respectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the

25

due process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity

The further and perhaps most

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case.

So you must conclude not only that on balance this

2

rises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it

3

does so with such remarkable clarity that it must have

4

been surely apparent to this officer that he was violating

5

that standard.

You cannot find that on this record.

6

The Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey,

7

which is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case,

8

not a freestanding substantive due process case and which

9

had all manner of important differences from the facts of

10

this case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of

11

exigency.

12

With the Court's permission --

13

QUESTION:

Exigency.

May I ask you a question

14

about that?

15

only -- only chance.

16

to this entire thing.

17

police, if they wanted some view other than the police

18

officers who engaged in the -- in the shooting, just to

Wouldn't he be a lot clearer than a

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, he -- he was the most

3

important non-police witness to these events, and I

4

suggest that the officer would have been derelict not to

5

have found out what happened from him, which is what he

6

was trying to do.

7
8

10

And with the Court's permission, I'd like to
reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-

17

incrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal

18

trial process and ensures that an individual is not

19

convicted on the basis of a coerced confession.

20

But the privilege against self-incrimination is

21

not a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law

22

enforcement officers.

23

no substantive constitutional limits on what law officers

24

may do to obtain information or to secure a confession.

25

But those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment

This is not to say that there are

Well, I think generally, at least

16

as I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento

17

against Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts

18

where things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of

19

intent element.

20

I think that --

QUESTION:

It's not enough, you think, to find

21

that the officer should have known that you couldn't ask

22

questions in the manner that was done here under these

23

circumstances, and that to proceed gives rise to an

24

inference of intent.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm not sure how intent

1

would need to be proven in any particular case, but I

2

would say the critical difference between the Fifth

3

Amendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry,

4

when it's -- when it's done in the context of the

5

admissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context,

6

what the courts are taking into account is the effect on

7

the integrity of the trial process of using a coerced

8

confession.

9

It's a different calculus, though, when you're

10

trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because

11

it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement

12

officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there

13

may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that

14

you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the

15

trial.

16

QUESTION:

What about the order of a trial judge

17

in a civil case who orders the witness held in contempt

18

and confined unless he testifies, and -- and there's a

19

valid Fifth Amendment privilege that the judge is

20

overlooking?

21

No Fifth Amendment violation there?

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I don't think there's a Fifth

Amendment violation.

1

of habeas corpus and you don't mention the Fifth

2

Amendment.
MR. CLEMENT:

3

You mention the Fifth Amendment,

4

but I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in

5

this context works a -- a bit like the takings clause.

6

And Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in

7

Balsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is

8

unusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the

9

government.

10

It doesn't say that in all contexts, the

government cannot coerce confessions.
QUESTION:

11

What it says --

Well, if there's a 1983 suit against

12

a judge in -- in this hypothetical case, what's -- what's

13

the violation?

MR. CLEMENT:

15

been dealt with on -- on habeas.

16

is --

QUESTION:

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, typically those cases have
And what I would say

Suppose it's a 1983 suit.
If there's a 1983 suit in that

19

context, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in

20

that context.

21

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't there be a 1983 suit

22

provided that -- and I think this is the assumption of

23

Justice Kennedy's question -- provided that the witness

24

had invoked the Fifth Amendment?

25

action there because that is one at least of two instances

There would be a 1983

in which we allow the Fifth Amendment to have an

2

application in anticipation.

3

they don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to

4

let this entire process go forward to no avail since

5

nothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway.

6

is we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in

7

anticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983

8

liability here.

9

would be true in the -- in the case of the -- the civil

We say if he raises it, and

The fact

That's not this case, but that -- that

example that Justice Kennedy gave, wouldn't it?
MR. CLEMENT:

11

I think that's a very good point,

12

Justice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the

13

penalty context -QUESTION:

14

Well, is it good enough so that you

15

concede there would be 1983 liability there; i.e., that

16

there would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that

17

case?
MR. CLEMENT:

18
19

I don't think so, but I think it

would --

20

QUESTION:

Not that good.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

But as I was trying to say --

QUESTION:

-- at least be a better case.

Is there any violation in the case

24

that I put, any constitutional violation?

25

that's -- that's extraordinary.

I mean,

1

MR. CLEMENT:

There is a -- there is a --

2

there -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference

3

with the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will

4

vindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional

5

violation.

as -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the

privilege against self-incrimination is not purely and

simply binding on the government.

And I think the critical distinction is that,

The government can

What it can't do is compel testimony and

11

attempt to use it in a criminal case.

And --

Well, maybe the -- the point where it

would make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about

We have Miranda on the
You

Now, a failure to give a warning,

Then there is.

And that comes

But there are a set of cases where it will hurt

people.

The set of cases where it will hurt people is

23

where because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him

24

up, and got a statement, they kept him in jail.

25

rather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

That's
So

1

there he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been

2

hurt, all right.

3

And the question I guess is -- it's really not

4

this case, but the question is, is there going to be a

5

1983 action in that kind of case?

6

under the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes.

7

And if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment,

8

the answer is going to be no.

9

should -- it seems to me what we're going to decide in

10
11

And if you say it comes

I don't know if we

this case is effectively going to decide that.
MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I don't think that's true.

12

I think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned

13

on some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth

14

Amendment violation.

15

QUESTION:

There may be other -Then he goes under the Fourth, and he

16

claims he's wrongly seized and imprisoned because they got

17

this statement out of him in violation of the Fifth.

18

That's -- I mean, this is -- this is what's -- what's

19

worrying me is not so much this case, but what we're going

20

to write and the implications of it.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and I think that this Court

22

has already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a

23

self-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the

24

testimony and the use of it in a criminal case.

25

QUESTION:

But may I just interrupt,

Mr. Clement?

somebody, who claims a -- a privilege against divulging

information, and that -- and the court holds him in

4

contempt and locks him up for 30 days or something, and he

claims he -- his Fifth Amendment right was violated, you'd

6

say there's no Fifth Amendment violation.
MR. CLEMENT:

no damages action.
QUESTION:

9

So how could he get out of jail then?
Well, he could get a habeas action

to get out because the court would be granting relief --

MR. CLEMENT:

I would say there's no -- there's

Of course, he could get --

20

He's -- he's locked up, as Justice Breyer says,

MR. CLEMENT:

I can't understand that.

Well, in any event, let me just

21

say that the privilege works quite differently in the

22

custodial context.

23

that in the context of a civil trial, the individual has

24

to raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves.

25

And we have a different rule that operates in the context

The reason that hypo even comes up is

to raise it.

4

In that context, the

The individual doesn't have

And -- as -- the other thing that's different

5

about the custodial context is that in the custodial

6

context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony

grant of immunity.

8

exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from

9

occurring.

10

They've always held that the

In that context, it's not enough for the

QUESTION:

It's only a constitutional

But are you saying that -- to go back

to a question that was asked earlier, that if there -- if

the police just take somebody into custody and beat him up

in order to get -- get him to talk with no intention of

20

using the evidence at all -- they're just trying to

21

investigate a crime -- is there any constitutional

protection against that kind of conduct?

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, and it's the substantive due

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think to get back to that

2

point, what's important is in the context of trying to

3

protect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I

4

would think the courts would want to be quite careful

5

about what they let into evidence.

6

law enforcement officers, they're dealing with other

7

objectives than simply trying to get a confession to

8

secure a guilty verdict.

QUESTION:

But in the context of

15

It --

-- an activity that might violate the

Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. CLEMENT:

I think it should, Justice

16

O'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's

17

best done on remand --

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

-- because, although there is a

20

due process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault

21

that in light of the -- the governing precedent in the

22

Ninth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought

23

that they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of

24

the factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry.

25

Again, that's not the way respondents briefed the case,

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they

2

did, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper

3

that as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to

4

have the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a

5

full substantive due process violation.

6

it's -QUESTION:

7

And I think

And you disagree with Mr. Robbins who

8

said, but because of the qualified immunity, you wouldn't

send this back in any case.
MR. CLEMENT:

10

Well, I -- I don't really disagree

11

with him.

I think this Court could reach the qualified

12

immunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the

13

path of least resistance would be to just note that there

14

is a substantive due process limit, and that's something

15

that's best to be resolved on -- on remand.

I think the important -- oh, sorry.

1

changing theories of -- of liability in this case, but I

think we have to go back to the beginning.
The district court found at page 28, finally

defendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to

abridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to

That was the core of the

That was all of the evidence in the case.

10

The subsequent declarations that were submitted

were only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted

a motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law,

using all of the evidence provided by the defense and

giving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence,

that there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth

QUESTION:

Mr. Paz, let me -- let me tell you

18

why I have difficulty with the proposition which you're

19

urging, which is that any coercion that would suffice to

require the confession to be excluded from -- from trial

21

is also a coercion that violates the Fifth Amendment,

22

not -- leaving substantive due process aside.

23

Suppose you have a situation in which a --

a felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage

somewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police

3

hose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or

4

using a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to

5

coercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't

6

confess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like

7

that.

8

from the confession from the trial, but the policeman

9

doesn't care about that.

10

It isn't beating the person with a rubber

It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony

He wants to save the life of

the -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried.
Now, you would say that that -- that policeman

11
12

by extracting that confession has violated the Fifth

13

Amendment.
MR. PAZ:

14

There may be a violation, and -- and I

15

would agree that most likely if -- if it was in violation

16

of Miranda, there would be -- there would be no -- it

would not be admitted into a criminal case.

police have to act, and so the police act if it's

reasonable, even if it's a reasonable mistake, even if

13

MR. PAZ:

14

QUESTION:

Not at all, Your Honor.
So maybe the answer would be that --

15

that it's not -- the Fifth Amendment -- the -- the Miranda

16

rules are methods of enforcing the Fifth Amendment so that

17

if all is violated in -- in Justice Scalia's hypothetical

18

is a Miranda rule and the person is not proceeded against

19

in court and the person has not been physically injured in

20

any way and has not suffered any real harm except not

21

being read a right that didn't matter anyway, he would

22

have no damages.

going to live without some medication -- I believe this

the police may not exercise any coercion to get the

That -- that was, as

prosecution.

nonetheless, the State could -- could lock the person up

that if he did testify, it would not be introducible in

6

And we said,

Now, I -- you know, it's a bizarre case, but it

has begun?

It seems to me that petitioner can win this case

14

the hard way or the easy way.

The easy way is recognizing

15

that this body of law is, as one of the members said this

16

morning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross

17

currents that cut in a variety of directions, that in

18

light of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against

19

Lewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional

20

principles was sufficiently clearly established to warrant

21

the rejection of qualified immunity.

22

the hard way.

But I want to win it

First, because under Sacramento against Lewis,

23
24

the standard for substantive due process is intent to

25

harm.

That wasn't pled.

That wasn't tried.

There's no

1

such argument before you today.

No one thinks that if

2

Sacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a

3

substantive due process claim at all.

4

wasn't in the complaint.

5

suggesting intent to harm.

That's why it

And no one here before you is

Now, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy,

6
7

I'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've

8

articulated because I think it is -- it is in fact

9

possible to square those concerns with the holding in

10

Murphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I

11

can tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what

12

this Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail-

13

safe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth

14

Amendment.

15

the availability of use immunity under the Fifth

16

Amendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation.

17

In each of the penalty cases that are suggested

So long as the government has not compromised

18

by your hypothetical, that's what the government has done.

19

They have said to the witness, you may not have immunity.

20

You may not assert your Fifth Amendment.

21

your Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in

22

lock-up right now.

23

know, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a

24

guy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as

25

use.

If you assert

The Court has consistently said, you

That's a protection that stems from the Fifth

1

Amendment itself.
And that's -- that explains all of the so-called

2
3

penalty cases.

4

Jersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York.

5

explains -- what is, in fact, going on there is someone is

6

being punished or penalized for the assertion of a

7

privilege, including the right against use.

That

But as long as the fail-safe in the words --

8
9

The police -- the Garrity case in New

Justice Souter, that you used in -- in footnote 8 of

10

Balsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not

11

been compromised, as it has not been in this case, there

12

is not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can

13

only happen when there's a use in a criminal case.
And that is exactly the point that this Court in

14
15

Verdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth

16

Circuit decided to call dictum and ignore.

17

mistake.

18

Amendment portion of its decision --

That was a big

And on that ground alone, it's the Fifth

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Robbins, why couldn't -- why

couldn't -MR. ROBBINS:

-- that should be reversed at the

first threshold.
QUESTION:

Why couldn't you view the continued

24

questioning under the circumstances of this case as

25

tantamount to punishment when you have locked somebody up

who won't answer questions?

2

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I -- I think because --

3

well, for one thing, the availability of use immunity is

4

still there.

5

think -- what I think it would amount to is continued

6

coercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold,

7

once you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to

8

render the statement admissible.

9

Fifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not

What you -- what I think it would -- what I

But that's when the

10

use it.

11

because the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as

12

it was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's

13

hypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we

14

don't even have to reach the question of qualified

15

immunity.

16
17

That would violate the Fifth Amendment.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

Thank you very much,

Mr. Robbins.

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the

20

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
