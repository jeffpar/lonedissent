ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Hernandez v. New York described a hypothetical

11
12

case, a case in which the evidence of racial

13

discrimination during jury selection was so strong that,

14

quote, "a finding of no discrimination is simply too

15

incredible to be accepted."

16

exceptional case, and therefore the Court should use it as

17

a model, a model of the weight of evidence sufficient to

18

render objectively unreasonable a trial judge's rejection

19

of a Batson challenge.
QUESTION:

20

This is truly that

Indeed, whatever --

Well, now you -- you -- Mr. -- Mr.

21

Waxman, you've got two presumptions going against you

22

here:

23

the trial court has to be deferred to, and then the AEDPA

24

presumption.

25

account.

the -- the first, the Hernandez presumption that

So I -- I hope you'll take those into

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. WAXMAN:

I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief

Justice.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. WAXMAN:

I fully recognize, as an officer of

5

this Court and somebody who has followed this

6

jurisprudence, that even on direct -- that the deference

7

that is paid to a trial judge in a Batson hearing is so

8

strong that even in Hernandez, this case said on direct

9

review -- and Hernandez made reference to the high

10

standards of proof in habeas -- even on direct review, we

11

are going to require proof that a trial court's finding of

12

fact in a Batson hearing is erroneous by clear and

13

convincing evidence.

14

And to that, AEDPA enacted subsection

15

2254(d)(2), which says that you -- a writ may not issue

16

unless the State court adjudication resulted in a decision

17

that was based on an unreasonable determination of the

18

facts in light of the evidence presented.

19

There are very good reasons to provide these

20

dual levels of deference to the trial judge.

The trial

21

judge in the case, of course, is the finder of fact, and

22

in Hernandez this Court has made clear that the ultimate

23

finding in this case, the finding of whether or not the

24

trial prosecutor engaged in intentional discrimination in

25

making race the tipping factor, a but-for factor with

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

respect to the strike of any peremptory -- of any juror

2

under a peremptory challenge -- is a factual

3

determination.
But (d)(2) and the clear and convincing evidence

4
5

standard are there for a reason.

6

truly exceptional case in which there are reasons to

7

believe that the trial judge's findings are deluded, and

8

there are reasons to believe that the evidence suggesting

9

that the trial judge's finding was unreasonable are

10

They are there for the

overwhelming.
And I'd like to address the first first and the

11
12

second second, because I think it is entirely clear that

13

given the facts of this case and the way in which the --

14

the trial judge in this case conducted the hearing, that

15

whatever this Court decides, this case is going to stand

16

as a benchmark, either that these facts represent an

17

extreme that cannot be tolerated or that even these

18

extreme facts are tolerable under Batson.

19

Now, let me speak first to the trial judge.

20

The trial judge was conscientious and he was, of

21

course, to some extent disabled by the fact that the trial

22

in this case immediately preceded this Court's decision in

23

Batson.

24

trial occurred before Batson, but the case was pending on

25

direct appeal when Batson was decided.

That is, this is one of these few cases where the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And so we have in this case a trial judge who

2

conducted the Batson hearing over 2 years after the jurors

3

testified and after the trial prosecutors gave their

4

reasons for all but two of the jurors.

5

one hallmark of deference, which is that the trial judge

6

is a percipient witness of the res gestae, if you will,

7

did not exist in this case.

8

under the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflect

9

significantly more than a dozen cases decided by this

And therefore, the

The -- the decided cases

10

judge in that 2-year interim period.

He saw thousands of

11

venire members and undoubtedly heard hundreds, if not

12

thousands, of Batson explanations.
And moreover, whereas it is true that the trial

13
14

judge observes the demeanor of the witnesses and a

15

prosecutor can certainly use as a race-neutral reason

16

questions raised about a juror's fitness or suitability

17

based on demeanor, the objections in this case, with one

18

limited exception, the prosecutor said nothing about the

19

demeanor.

20

the 11 African Americans who were struck were substantive

21

reasons there on the record.
In addition, the trial judge in this case did

22
23
24
25

The prosecutor's stated objections to the 10 of

not -QUESTION:

Well, but certainly demeanor could

play a part in that even though you don't -- you don't say

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

3

QUESTION:

I --

You say he's -- he's prejudiced

4

against the Government and, you know, perhaps the way he

5

answered questions may give you a reason to think that,

6

that the transcript doesn't.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

I can -- I -- I embrace that, Mr.

8

Chief Justice.

9

of work, I was a trial lawyer and I can remember

10
11

For many years before I entered this line

exercising peremptory strikes just because of hesitation.
My only limited point here is that unlike many

12

voir dire hearings -- and I've now reviewed many -- there

13

was only one single isolated instance in which the

14

prosecutor, in giving his reasons either at the time or in

15

the Batson hearing, said he hesitated or his demeanor led

16

me to question it.

17

I think this case is more susceptible to meaningful

18

appellate review.

And so in that one respect, I -- again

19

But I have two more points I think it's very

20

important for the Court to consider about the way this

21

trial judge conducted this unusual case.

22

QUESTION:

At -- at what stage, Mr. Waxman?

23

say this was 2 years after the actual trial?

24

-- a State habeas proceeding or something?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, no.

You

There was a

It was direct appeal.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

The

1

case was tried.

2

During the -- right after -- I think a month after the

3

case was tried, Batson was decided, and 2 years later, the

4

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals abated -- the Texas Court

5

of Criminal Appeals said 10 of 11 African Americans were

6

struck.

That raises an inference of discrimination under

7

Batson.

Remand it for a Batson hearing.

8

that hearing that the judge made the findings of fact and

9

conclusions of law that are reflected in the -- in the

10

There was an immediate appeal taken.

And it was at

joint appendix.
There was a subsequent habeas proceeding in the

11
12

State courts, but the habeas proceeding didn't deal with

13

the Batson issue because it had been fully exhausted.
The trial judge, in evaluating Batson, did not

14
15

look at the very substantial evidence of pattern and

16

practice evidence with respect to what was going on in

17

Dallas County at this time, evidence that the magistrate

18

deemed appalling.

19

it.

20

racially disparate -- disparate questioning of the jurors

21

in venire on the question -- their ability to impose a

22

minimum sentence --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

He was told by the State not to look at

He did not consider what the State acknowledges to be

How do we know -- how do we know he

didn't look at that?
MR. WAXMAN:

We -- we don't know to a certainty

8

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that he didn't.

evidence was irrelevant.

position that a -- that comparative evidence between white

jurors and black jurors was irrelevant.

ground on which they urged this Court to deny the petition

for certiorari on direct appeal.

10
11

He was told by the State that all of that
Indeed, the State took the

That was the

All I can say is it's
The --

violation of Batson.
QUESTION:

But he did say, didn't he, when he

12

admitted the -- as you pointed out, when he admitted the

13

-- the newspaper article, that he'd take it for what it

14

was worth?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

He did.

And there's an ambiguity,

16

and that's why we think, interestingly, that this case is

17

a (d)(2) case rather than a (d)(1) case.

18

as opposed to in the State courts, the State of Texas is

19

here before you saying the judge considered everything.

20

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals considered everything.

21

They don't have to discuss everything that they

22

considered, and therefore, there is no legal error that

23

was committed.

24

if that's right or not.

25

but whether it's right or not, the result that they

In this Court,

And our submission to you is I don't know
It doesn't appear to be right,

1

reached, the conclusion that they made that there was no

2

-- that -- that race was not a but for factor with respect

3

to not one, not two, but six of these people.
Under the record of this case and in light of

4
5

the way they conducted the jury shuffle in this case,

6

which cannot be justified on non-racial grounds -QUESTION:

7

Before you get to the jury shuffle,

8

how long before the -- the voir dire in this case had the

9

newspaper article surfaced?

And there were, I guess, two

10

sitting judges who had once been prosecutors and they

11

said, well, we had a manual that we work with.

12

there be an argument that that -- that the last indication

13

that the manual was being used was 5 years before this

14

trial?

15

up to the time of the voir dire?

16

that?

17
18

Could

Or is there evidence that it was being used right

MR. WAXMAN:

Could you tell me about

I'll address the newspaper articles

first, I guess you were asking about, and also the manual.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

The newspaper articles -- there

21

were two series of newspaper articles.

There were three

22

articles that came out in the first or second week of

23

March which was either just as the 4 or 5 weeks of jury

24

selection was closing or after it, but it was before the

25

trial began.

And those articles precipitated the -- what

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was called a Swain challenge but it -- what became a

2

Swain-Batson challenge.
There were -- there were other articles that

3
4

were subsequently issued after the -- after the trial in

5

the case but before the direct appeal and the Batson

6

remand that looked at the racial percentages in capital

7

cases which mirrored the -- in many ways the -- the March

8

9th article that examined jury selection in 100 felony

9

cases.
Now, the manual.

10

There were two manuals in the

11

case.

12

manual, was not offered.

13

Dallas Morning News article which was admitted in evidence

14

at the Batson hearing.

15

One of them, the earlier, more explicit 1963
It is discussed in the March 9th

The other manual, the John Sparling manual --

16

Mr. Sparling testified.

There was testimony in the case

17

by Judge Baraka and one other witness -- and it may have

18

been Mr. Sparling -- that they were not sure when the

19

manual ceased to be used.

20

Appeals in a case called Halliburton concluded that the

21

manual was in use at least through the early 1980's I

22

think or in -- by 1980 or something like --

The Texas Court of Criminal

23

QUESTION:

And this trial was '85?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

But one of the things that's most striking in

This trial was '86 I believe.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the case is -- there's -- there -- it is clear that at

2

least one of the two prosecutors in this case was trained

3

by this office at a time when the manual was concededly in

4

use.

The other one may have been.

5

But one of the things that I found striking,

6

just going through the juror information cards yesterday

7

actually in preparing for the oral argument, which appear

8

in the joint lodging at pages 54 to 108 -- these are the

9

juror cards that people get, the prosecutors and trial

10

lawyers get, before voir dire begins.

11

is noted there, the race and the gender and religion and

12

beards and things like that, there is a remarkable

13

coincidence with the issues and factors that are

14

specifically addressed in the Sparling training manual.

15

It's not our submission that it's proof they were trained

16

by it.

17

they used it.

18

evidence just as a --

It's not our submission that they adhered to it or
We're using this pattern and practice

QUESTION:

19
20

ask one question?

21

cards, do you know?

Mr. Waxman, could I just interrupt to

When were those notations put on those

MR. WAXMAN:

22

If you look at what

The answer must be that they were

23

put on at different times.

If you look at the notations

24

that say -- the race and the gender notations, each one

25

has it.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Now, these are --

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Those had to have been put on

3

before any questioning occurred because there -- they are

4

on those cards for jurors that were never reached or were

5

never questioned.

6

that appear to be in different handwriting, and I don't

7

think the record shows it at all, but you can infer that

8

they were noted at the same time that the prosecution made

9

notes on the jury questionnaires which are also in the --

10

There are other notations about answers

in the joint lodging.

11

But the -- the other point I just want to make

12

about the trial judge is the -- we know -- there's not a

13

question about whether the trial judge's findings are

14

unreasonable in light of the evidence.

15

the trial judge said there was no disparate examination of

16

any venire member.

17

Finding number 6,

Well, in this Court, the State has totally

18

disavowed that.

The State acknowledges that when jurors

19

were questioned about their ability to impose the minimum

20

punishment for the lesser included offense of murder, they

21

used two different scripts.

22

the means of execution, they used a graphic script that

23

went on in detail to explain how somebody is executed in

24

Texas, and a regular script that just said, how do you

25

feel about the death penalty?

And when they talked about

Now, they --

1

QUESTION:

If we agree -- if we agree with your

2

analysis of number 6, does that suffice to vitiate number

3

2?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

QUESTION:

I --

That the -- that the court finds that

6

the explanations given by the prosecutors in each --

7

prosecutor in each case were completely credible.

8
9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

is number 10 -QUESTION:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

14

The one that

we're -- that -- that you have to focus most directly on

11

13

I think it does.

That's the conclusion.
-- which is the -- the finding,

which is the ultimate finding.
But my point is that there are a number of

15

findings that this judge made that are at the very least

16

suspect and one in which the State has completely walked

17

away from.

18

And I want -- I want to spend, if I can, just a

19

few minutes talking about the jury shuffle and the

20

disparate questioning because I've been a trial lawyer for

21

many years, but never tried a case in this system, and it

22

was sort of a little bit confusing to me.

23

But with respect to the disparate questioning,

24

each of the prospective jurors was questioned about

25

whether they could impose the minimum punishment if they

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

found that the offense was murder and not capital murder,

2

and the minimum punishment being 5 years.

3

also asked about their views about capital punishment.

And they were

Now, some of those people who were asked about

4
5

their views about capital punishment were first treated to

6

a graphic description of how that punishment occurs.

7

some of the people who were questioned about minimum

8

punishment were told in advance the range is 5 years to 99

9

years.

Could you do either?

And

And many of them were just

10

asked, what do you think the minimum penalty is that you

11

would impose for willful, deliberate, intentional, cold-

12

blooded murder where there was no robbery?
And our submission in our principal brief and

13
14

below was that the State used those disparities in a

15

racially discriminatory manner and that bears tremendously

16

on the intent of the prosecutor in executing the

17

peremptory strikes.

18

QUESTION:

And their -Are you saying -- are you saying that

19

the prosecutor on voir dire must ask, when he gets to the

20

question of, you know, how do you feel about -- must ask

21

the same questions to every juror?
MR. WAXMAN:

22

Not at all.

They don't have to ask

23

the same questions.

They don't have to ask them in the

24

same way.

25

the same questions and they ask them in a way which is

All that we're saying is that when they do ask

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

acknowledged to be different and they acknowledge that

2

they --

3

QUESTION:

Well now, wait a minute.

You say

4

when they do ask the same questions and they ask them in a

5

way that's acknowledged to be different, that seems like a

6

contradiction just starting out.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8
9

I think I -- I managed to confuse

even myself.
QUESTION:

Good.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. WAXMAN:

The prosecution -- I believe that

12

Ms. Bunn will confirm.

13

different ways of questioning about these two subjects,

14

and we used them deliberately at -- with different jurors

15

and we did it in order to remove jurors that we thought

16

were weak on the death penalty.

17

they give and that's the reason against which their

18

justification must be judged, and it is --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

The prosecution said we had two

That is the reason that

You would concede that would be

legitimate, that that -MR. WAXMAN:

Sure, if you -- I -- if you --

22

somebody says, look, I -- there's no way I can impose the

23

death penalty, and -- as a -- as a prosecutor I don't want

24

-- I don't know if I can use a for cause strike, I don't

25

want to use a peremptory, let me see if I can't get them

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to say something that will allow the judge to knock them

2

out for cause, that's entirely legitimate.

3

The question is why did they do it.

Because it

4

would be illegitimate if they were doing it deliberately

5

disproportionately against black jurors because they were

6

black and it would be legitimate if they were saying,

7

okay, you know, people who expressed hesitation about the

8

death penalty -- we're going to do everything we can to

9

try and get rid of these people for cause.
And let's just look at the State's own

10
11

statistics.

This is their statistics from their brief at

12

pages 17 and 18 and notes 38 and 39.
With respect to minimum punishment, seven of the

13
14

eight African American jurors who were questioned about

15

minimum punishment were not told in advance that the

16

minimum punishment was 5 years.

17

what they thought minimum punishment was, they said 20

18

years, life.

19

penalty was the minimum -- minimum -- punishment.

And when they were asked

One person said that he thought the death

For the whites, 36 white jurors were questioned.

20
21

Two -- only two were not told that it was 5 years in

22

advance.

23

need to compare those jurors who had expressed hesitation

24

about the death penalty because that was our factor.

25

they identify in their brief 10 white jurors and 10 black

Now, they say that's not fair because you only

And

17

MR. WAXMAN:

The inability to impose the minimum

for inability to impose minimum punishment, however odd

that seems given the role of the prosecution in a case.

at their word, that means, nonetheless, that a black

hesitant juror was three-and-a-half times more likely than

that their 10 white jurors wildly understates the number

And we go through in our brief -- perhaps in as

not as much detail as -- as would be appropriate but,

13

nonetheless, given the page limits -- and show that the

14

State on at least three occasions used the -- its

prerogative to shuffle the jury for the obvious purpose of

moving African American jurors who were in the front of

17

the venire where they would be questioned to the back of

18

the venire each week where they would not.
And here it's important to understand something

about the procedure in this case.

they wanted to, quote, shuffle the jury.

QUESTION:

What does that mean?

3

QUESTION:

What does it mean?

4

QUESTION:

Would you tell us?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

I will try to tell you and I would

6

respectfully refer you, in case I fail, to the Texas Bar

7

Journal article that we cited in our reply brief by a

8

professor at, I think, the University of Houston which

9

explains this practice.

10

But in Texas, jurors of course are -- venires

11

are required to be chosen randomly, but there has always

12

been a practice -- and it's now codified by statute --

13

that allows the -- the lawyers in the case -- this is in

14

civil and criminal cases -- to look at the venire as it's

15

arrayed in order and based on what Judge Holcomb explained

16

for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, based on, quote,

17

visual preference, because they haven't questioned these

18

jurors at all, the State and then the defense can say we

19

want to reshuffle the order.

20

And it is well understood in Texas that the principal

21

reason for doing that is race and gender.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

We don't like the order.

What are the consequences of, quote,

reshuffling the order?
MR. WAXMAN:

What happens is you take the -- the

juror cards and it's either done in the central jury room

or in the courtroom, and they are shuffled either by the

2

clerk shuffling the way you would shuffle a deck or, in

3

this case, they were apparently, according to the record,

4

put into a metal basket and the lawyer would sort of run

5

his hands around and they'd pick them out, and they would

6

then be in a new order.

7

shuffle or declined to exercise its shuffle, the defense

8

could choose whether to shuffle or not.

And after the State exercised its

QUESTION:

Are the jurors actually then reseated

10

or are they just called in --

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

No.

They are reseated so that --

Everybody gets up and moves and the

13

back people get in the front, the front people get in the

14

back.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed.

16

not once, but twice.

17

because what the judge --

Indeed, and it can be done

And it's particularly critical here

18

QUESTION:

What's the consequence?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

I --

Here's the -- here's the

20

consequence.

The way the jury was picked here, they

21

questioned -- they questioned between 15 and -- generally

22

between 15 and 20.

23

they were doing individual voir dire.

24

not in the first 15 out of the 50 or certainly in the

25

first 30 out of the 50, you weren't going to be questioned

One week they got to 30 jurors because
And so if you were

Alderson Reporting Company

at all.

2

if they were -- when the order was finally set, if they

3

were in the last two rows, they could just go home that

4

day and never come back.

5

In fact, the judge told them at the outset, that

And so the consequence of shuffling in this case

6

wasn't the consequence you'd have if you had 50 jurors

7

picked -- this is a capital case.

8

9

consequential what order you're in.

We're going to ask all

But here the order

10

meant everything.

11

prosecution could get the black jurors out of the first 15

12

or 20 and into the back, they wouldn't have to worry about

13

the disparate questioning or exercising peremptory

14

challenges.

15

it doesn't involve an admission but it is very, very

16

strong evidence.

17

If you could get -- if the -- if the

And the -- the record in this case I think --

I -- I just want to say, before sitting down for

18

rebuttal, a point that may be obvious, but it is

19

surpassingly important for this Court to decide the merits

20

of the Batson challenge.

in which -- in which this Court delineates the contours of

constitutional doctrine by demonstrating what result a

given set of facts yields.

quantum of proof, can also only be demonstrated and

that a trial court's acceptance of a prosecutor as

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

MS. BUNN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Prosecutors in this case exercised their

17

peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors whom

18

they believed were biased against the State, a belief

19

based not on stereotypical assumptions but on the views

20

actually expressed by these jurors during voir dire.

21

The trial judge, who observed firsthand the

22

entire voir dire process, credited the prosecutors' race-

23

neutral, case-related reasons for the strikes.

24

judge's findings of no purposeful discrimination are fully

25

supported by the record and they are entitled to deference

jurors are excused because of their expressed views on the

death penalty, excused by the State.

It is

First, petitioner's attempts to make comparisons

with white jurors are not supported by the record.

do not have equivalent views, and in any event, to the

extent that disparate questioning happened, it was

be circumstantial evidence, but it is not present in this

case.

QUESTION:

So that would

But may I ask on that -- that

6

question that if the different script was based on concern

7

about the person's attitude toward the death penalty,

8

would it not be true, because the script is -- comes very

9

early in the examination, that the doubt about the death

10

penalty must either have been shown in the written

11

response questionnaire or something said right before that

12

script took -- took place?

13
14

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor, that's true and

that's supported by the record in this case.

15

QUESTION:

You think it is, yes.

16

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Every prospective

17

juror who was questioned -- with -- with the exception of

18

one white juror, every juror questioned in -- with the

19

graphic script at the outset of the questioning had

20

expressed some level of opposition to the death penalty in

21

their juror questionnaire.

22

QUESTION:

Ms. Bunn, how do you define --

23

QUESTION:

Now, the one -- may I just follow

24

with one question?

Now, the one juror who said there were

25

four categories of death penalty and he said he was

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

somewhere between one and two, would that have been

2

sufficient to justify that kind of script?
MS. BUNN:

3

Well, perhaps following up with it.

4

Now, that particular juror -- I believe you're referring

5

to Edwin Rand -- had no -- there was no indication on his

6

questionnaire of opposition to the death penalty.

7

why the prosecutor did not lead off with the graphic

8

script for Mr. Rand.

9

and then the response of Mr. Rand that he didn't know if

That's

However, after responses like that

10

he could -- maybe today he could impose the death penalty,

11

but tomorrow maybe he couldn't, after that kind of

12

questioning, then the prosecutor did lead up further along

13

in the examination with a semi-graphic script, but

14

certainly not at the outset.

15

QUESTION:

Thank you.

16

QUESTION:

There is -- I think on your numbers

17

there were 10 white venire members and 10 black who

18

expressed, on the questionnaire, hesitancy about the death

19

penalty.

20

jurors who got the graphic script and there were I think

21

eight of the blacks.

22

But of those, there were only two of the white

MS. BUNN:

Well, Your Honor, first off, that's

23

not -- that's not precisely true according to the record.

24

We did list in a footnote 10 white jurors who had, at some

25

point, expressed hesitancy about the death penalty.

Alderson Reporting Company

However, unfortunately, we do not in a sense have a

complete record because the juror questionnaires of the

white jurors are not in the record in this case.

the juror questionnaires of the African American jurors.

The defense counsel did not argue at

all the issue of -- of disparate questioning.

But if the -- if the prosecution

MS. BUNN:

Well, again, Your Honor, the -- the

record in this case doesn't support those numbers also

22

because we can look to an -- as analogy to the African

hesitation about the death penalty in their initial juror

All right.

But those --

3

QUESTION:

I'm getting confused.

I thought the

4

numbers we were talking about were your numbers, 10 of

5

each.
MS. BUNN:

6

They were -- they were numbers that

7

we set forth in talking about -- in discussing the

8

disparate questioning, jurors -- white jurors who had at

9

some point expressed hesitancy about the death penalty.

10

However, to infer from those numbers that it was that

11

universe of jurors who the -- who the prosecutors had to

12

consider their juror questionnaires in determining whether

13

at the outset to -- to use the graphic script, that is not

14

-- that is not how we intended the footnote.
QUESTION:

15

I see.

You mean some of that

16

reservation of the death penalty may come later in the --

17

in the questioning.

18

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't the prosecutor

20

have then used the graphic script, or it would have been

21

too late?

22

MS. BUNN:

Well, in some instances the

23

prosecutor did both with African American and white

24

jurors, jurors who initially in their juror questionnaires

25

did not indicate any opposition to the death penalty, but

into their question -- into their voir dire examination

did, and there are instances where the prosecutor did go

3

into the graphic script later on in the examination.

But

4

that is not what the petitioner is relying on here.

He --

5

QUESTION:

Why --

6

QUESTION:

Isn't the fact that we are having

7

this colloquy with you about the significance of the

8

numbers a pretty good argument for the proposition that at

9

least reasonable jurists might disagree about the

10

significance of it, and therefore there should have been a

11

-- a certificate of appeal issued here?

12

MS. BUNN:

Well, Your Honor, given the level of

13

deference that the trial judge's findings were entitled to

14

in this case, we do not think that it -- it presents that

15

kind of case regardless of the --

16

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me your argument on

17

-- I'm not talking now about the -- the ultimate

18

resolution of it which Mr. Waxman addressed.

19

addressing the -- kind of the threshold question of

20

whether there should have been a COA here.

21

to me as though your argument is saying that unless the

22

defense has got just a slam dunk Batson argument at the

23

end of the day, there shouldn't be a COA, which -- which

24

perhaps reflects what the -- the court below was doing

25

when it seemed to -- to say that there wasn't going to be

I'm just

And it sounds

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a COA because at the end of the day, the -- the Batson

2

claim was not meritorious.
MS. BUNN:

3

Well, Your Honor, it is our position

4

that the court -- the court below correctly determined

5

that no COA should issue in this case given the multiple

6

levels of deference that the trial judge's findings were

7

entitled to, not only the Hernandez standard -QUESTION:

8
9

But isn't -- isn't the degree of

deference and the significance of that degree of deference

10

with respect to specific claims something that is worthy

11

of being determined in the appellate process rather than

12

something that ought to be determined at the threshold

13

before the appellate argument has even been made?
MS. BUNN:

14

Petitioner has -- has never argued

15

that he was not able to make any level of detailed

16

argument in this case in the court below.
QUESTION:

17

Well, regardless of what the

18

petitioner may have said, what's the answer to my

19

question?

20

pretty good case again by our colloquy here for the fact

21

that there was something for the court of appeals to

22

consider here on the -- on the -- the reasonable

23

disagreement among jurists standard?

24
25

I mean, aren't you -- aren't we making out a

the scheme of 2254(d), it is, as you referred to, a slam

and that is -- our position is that the court -- court

below correctly denied COA given the deference entitled --

that -- that the trial judge's findings were entitled to

in this case.

And petitioner did not meet the COA burden,

And getting back to the trial judge's findings,

8
9

However, in -- viewed to

just a few things that we disagree with the petitioner

10

about in characterizing the trial judge's handling of this

11

case.
First, the fact that technically the Batson

12
13

hearing was conducted 2 years after the trial, that is

14

true.

15

in this case, though it was pre-Batson, when defense

16

counsel raised an objection to the strike of an African

17

American juror, the prosecution came forward with his

18

race-neutral reasons immediately, contemporaneous --

However, when you look at the record of voir dire

19

QUESTION:

But that's not true in every case.

20

MS. BUNN:

Every case where defense counsel

21

objected to the strike of that particular juror.

22

is true with every juror challenged here with the

23

exception of Mr. Joe Warren.

24
25

QUESTION:

And that

Well, for example, the -- Joe

Warren's case was most interesting to me because the

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

prosecutor just exercised the peremptory without any

explanation whatsoever.

speech to the juror about how he had been a very fine

4

juror, and that was sort of the end of it.

on, we find out that he was -- he was not a very fine

juror.

MS. BUNN:

And then the judge made quite a

But nonetheless, defense counsel --

QUESTION:

The prosecutor did not give a reason

Defense counsel didn't object to the

striking -- the prosecutor's striking of that juror.

15

Certainly there was nothing even --

striking of every single African American juror with the

QUESTION:

While this doesn't

theme of saying that the hearing was conducted properly 2

years later, and I don't want to get you off of -- of

and maybe it's consistent with the two -- the hearing

you're about to describe.

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's the State's

So you would say then that you

haven't walked away from finding number 6?

9

MS. BUNN:

10

it's the State's position now.

11

position at the time of the Batson hearing that any

12

disparate questioning was a legitimate means to deal with

13

jurors who had expressed different views on different

issues but was not based on race.

with the trial judge's finding.

16

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, we have not.

It --

It was the State's

And that is consistent

So you think that the trial judge,

therefore, considered the issue of disparate questioning.

18

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, then the question

20

is, if they considered it, did he reach a reasonable

21

conclusion?

22

What about Justice Ginsburg's mentioning there

23

were at least eight white jurors who also expressed

24

reservations who were not given this graphic description

25

of what the death penalty involves, but instead were just

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

asked could you find against a person if that meant the

2

death penalty?

3

What about those eight people?

MS. BUNN:

Well, again, disparate questioning,

4

like many other pieces of evidence that petitioner is

5

relying on in this case, are circumstantial evidence of --

6

of discriminatory motive or can be in a given case.

7

Assuming that there -- that there was some level of -- of

8

disparateness, even within those jurors who had expressed

9

views about the death penalty --

10

QUESTION:

No.

The particular thing is what she

11

asked and you say right now, I think correctly, that the

12

trial judge did consider disparate questioning.

13

agree that I guess it was -- the number was approximately

14

8 of the 11 black jurors who expressed doubts about the

15

death penalty were asked this very graphic question, could

16

you find a person guilty and give him the death penalty

17

where that meant taking him in the gurney, et cetera.

18

Only two white jurors were asked that question.

19

take it that you concede that there were at least eight

20

other white jurors who also expressed doubts about the

21

death penalty who were not asked that question.

22

MS. BUNN:

You also

Yet, I

Well, I do not concede that to the

23

extent that it is identifying those jurors as being jurors

24

who expressed doubts about the death penalty in their

25

juror questionnaires, and that is the information that the

prosecutor had to go by.
QUESTION:
eight such people.

All right.

So you say there weren't

Fine.

4

MS. BUNN:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

Okay.

6

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

And I have another question which I

That's your answer.

8

think is to me more important, which is that these

9

ambiguous answers, a difficult question about what the

10

motive was of the prosecutor in peremptorily striking when

11

he has a legitimate reason, to decide whether it's

12

legitimate or not, I would have thought history, in terms

13

of how the county has behaved in general, would be highly

14

relevant to characterize and decide a difficult question

15

like that.

16

But on page 911 of this record, the magistrate

17

makes pretty clear that he thought history was not

18

relevant in reviewing that third part of Batson, reviewing

19

what the State did.

20

And the State court judge himself said on page

21

844 I guess whether or not I will give it -- I mean such

22

evidence -- any weight is another question, and never

23

referred to it again.

24

So in respect to that, what is your view?

25

MS. BUNN:

The State's view is that while the

1

Federal magistrate -- first I'll address the Federal

2

magistrate's handling of the issue.

3

position that the Federal magistrate did err in its

4

elucidation of the standard of -- its holding basically

5

that historical evidence is irrelevant at Batson's third

6

step.

7

does not entitle a petitioner to habeas corpus relief.

8

And -- and any error as well was cured when the Fifth

9

Circuit considered independently all of the evidence that

10
11
12
13

It is the State's

However, certainly an error by a Federal magistrate

petitioner had presented in his petition.
Moving on to the trial judge, however, there is
nothing in the record -QUESTION:

Well, but -- but why -- why isn't

14

this -- you're candid to say that you may have erred on

15

this one regard, but why -- why isn't this a -- a very

16

significant fact to which we must give great weight,

17

especially you indicated the evidence was circumstantial.

18

A little bit odd for a prosecutor to -- to say that

19

circumstantial evidence isn't important.

20

have in -- in these cases when we're trying to infer

21

motive, and best evidence is often circumstantial.

why isn't the historical evidence here overwhelming

MS. BUNN:

2

must key in on the reasons that the prosecutors struck

legitimate, case-related, race-neutral reasons.

6

where the trial judge's analysis began and ended, and it

overruled the State's objections to the pattern and

practice evidence on relevancy grounds.

9

QUESTION:

And in this

That's

Ms. Bunn, if -- if it begins and ends

10

with the prosecutor's neutral reasons, then you would

11

never have a successful Batson challenge because the

12

prosecutor could always give a neutral reason.

13

question that is troubling me is what in the end did the

14

court consider and look -- and the -- and the State trial

15

court said, well, he would take that so-called Swain

16

evidence for what it was worth.

17

never said how he resolved the question.

18

fact finding seemed to be going at these jurors, the black

19

jurors, against whom peremptories were exercised, one by

20

one and saying as to each one, there was a neutral reason

21

given and that's it.

22

figured in this package.

23

said, well, I'll take it -- take the Swain evidence for

this record what went on at that stage three.
MS. BUNN:

Well, respectfully I disagree.

The

3

trial judge found the prosecutor's reasons to be credible,

4

and in making that credibility determination and having

5

overruled the State's objections to this pattern and

6

practice evidence and stating candidly that he didn't know

7

what weight he was going to give it, given that while it

8

is circumstantial evidence, he's got a -- he's got a

9

record here where the prosecutor's reasons are supported.

10

QUESTION:

He --

11

QUESTION:

Well, but the credibility finding,

12

which is number 2, doesn't prevent us and -- and really

13

shouldn't prevent a court from determining whether that

14

credibility finding has a foundation.

15

this very persuasive historical evidence, the different

16

script, that all bears on whether the credibility finding

17

can -- can withstand scrutiny.

he concluded credibility and that's always for the trial

judge and then walk away or, as Justice Ginsburg said,

20

you'll never have a Batson challenge.

And if you have

You can't just say, well,

MS. BUNN:

We are not --

QUESTION:

Absent a finding that the -- the

23
24
25

prosecutor is dissembling based on demeanor.
MS. BUNN:

We are certainly not arguing that a

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

insulated from appellate review.

2

as this where the reasons credited by the trial judge are

3

supported by the record, there -- there is no basis to

4

overrule the trial judge's credibility determination.
QUESTION:

5

However, in a case such

Well, but that's not true as to

6

finding 6, because he didn't find there was no -- there

7

was justification for disparate questioning.

8

there was no disparate questioning.

9

perfectly clear that there was disparate questioning.
MS. BUNN:

10

He found

And the record is

However, in the context of the Batson

11

hearing that he was resolving, that finding is reasonably

12

understood as a finding that there was no disparate

questioning based on race.
QUESTION:

14
15

But if read literally, it's -- if

read literally, it's clearly incorrect.
And of course, as to the findings on

credibility, there's no finding as to any particular

19

-- I believe everything the prosecutor said.

20

that's what he found.

21

He just made a -- a gross finding that everybody

MS. BUNN:

Basically

The finding regarding disparate

22

questioning I believe is phrased as disparate questioning

23

of the challenged jurors.

24

that, yes, that supports the interpretation certainly that

25

it was made within the context of the Batson challenge and

So given that, I would say

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the finding was limited to based on race.

no disparate questioning based on race.

3

QUESTION:

There was

May -- may I ask one question about

4

the procedure?

Were the juror information cards that have

5

the notations about sex and -- and race noted on it --

6

when do you think those notations were made?

7

MS. BUNN:

I would --

8

QUESTION:

Because I find it significant there

9

are no notations or very few as to attitude toward the

10

death penalty, which is your -- your key to everything.

11

There doesn't seem to be any card on which the prosecutor

12

said soft on death or hard on death or anything like that.

13

MS. BUNN:

I believe that those sorts of

14

notations were made on the juror questionnaires rather

15

than the juror information cards.

16

with Mr. Waxman that the record does indicate that those

17

notations were made toward the beginning of the process,

18

prior to any individual questioning.

19

QUESTION:

And I -- I would agree

So that it would be fair to infer

20

that the prosecutor on each juror noted race and sex, but

21

did not note attitude toward death penalty.

MS. BUNN:

That -- that was all they had to go

2

on during the preliminary phases.

When they received the

3

-- after the -- the panel was finally seated, when the

4

jurors were given the questionnaires, then that's what the

5

parties worked from in making more notes in determining

6

which to challenge for cause and which to strike.
So, again, what can be inferred from that I -- I

It was before him and his

the record in this case clearly supports those -- those

And these jurors were jurors who the State --

both -- both white jurors and African American jurors who

the State struck were jurors who had expressed views that

the State was uncomfortable with.

And again, to get a feel for what the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4
5

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you.

I just have six short

rebuttal points to correct the record.

6

The -- while the graphic script was given at the

7

beginning of the voir dire and therefore based only on the

8

questionnaires, the minimum punishment ploy -- that is,

9

trying to trick jurors about minimum punishment -- was

10

done at the very end, after they had all of the evidence.

11

And therefore, the relevant universe of whites who

12

expressed hesitation is not 10, as the State says, but 19.

13

And in any event, even with 10, they are three-and-a-half

14

times as likely.

15

With -- also, we did -- the trial -- the defense

16

lawyers in this case objected over and over and over again

17

to trying to trick these black jurors by asking them what

18

minimum punishment they would give without expressing the

19

number.

20

The voir dire is replete with this.
With respect to the graphic script, which did

21

come at the beginning, well, the State now says, well, we

22

don't have the questionnaires for all the people, so we

23

don't really know how many there were.
