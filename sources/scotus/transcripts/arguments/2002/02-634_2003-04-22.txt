ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

First in Volt and then again last term in Waffle

12

House this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under

13

the Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not

14

coercion.

15

violated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case.

16

It is that core Federal principle that was

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Phillips, now, the contract

17

presumably can be interpreted in accordance with the law

18

of the State with jurisdiction.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor,

20

but this contract was not interpreted in accordance with

21

the understanding of the parties, with -- with respect to

22

the parties.

23

parties' consent to this kind of an agreement, and what

24

the South Carolina Supreme Court was quite clear about --

25

Ultimately, you have to look for the

QUESTION:

Well, there was no express provision

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

in the arbitration agreement saying that you can't have

2

class-wide arbitration.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

To be sure, there was no express

4

provision to that effect, but if you look at the South

5

Carolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it

6

says is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with

7

respect to class arbitration.

8

I've never read a class arbitration clause in any

9

contract, and I'm told that no one's ever even attempted

10
11

That's not surprising.

to draft a class arbitration clause.
But second of all, the -- the court went further

12

than that and said what was going to inform its judgment

13

about how to interpret or how to apply this particular

14

situation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language

15

or understanding of the parties.

16

any contractual directive whatsoever, stated twice, the

17

court simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class

18

arbitration proceeding.

What it was was, without

19

QUESTION:

Well, but the --

20

QUESTION:

Well, how does that -- how does

21

differ from Volt, Mr. Phillips?

There, the contract

22

didn't say anything about the court staying the

23

arbitration, and yet we said in our opinion that that was

24

a permissible thing for a -- that once the law of

25

California had been invoked, that was a permissible thing

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to be done.
MR. PHILLIPS:

2

In -- the difference between this

3

case and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties

4

agreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled

5

solely by California law.

6

parties.

That was the consent of the

7

QUESTION:

8

construction was -- was taken.

9

Well, they said the place where the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and that was understood by

10

this Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State

11

law, to embrace California law.

12

QUESTION:

But didn't -- didn't the -- didn't

13

the agreement here say it would be governed by the law of

14

South Carolina?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the underlying contract is

16

governed by South Carolina law, but the arbitration

17

provision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal

18

Arbitration Act.

19

QUESTION:

Well, is your -- your argument that

20

if the South Carolina court is unreasonable in

21

interpreting State law, then it comes up here?

22

just don't understand how we get this -- this question.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I

It seems to me there are two ways

24

you can get to this question.

In this case, there was no

25

effort by South Carolina Supreme Court to apply South

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Carolina law.

2

the consent of the parties.

3

result based on their view of efficiency and equity which

4

involves the interests of completely third parties to

5

this -- to this situation, not the parties to this

6

particular agreement.
QUESTION:

7
8

What they did -- they're not looking for
They're looking to coerce a

If --

Why do you -- I'm sorry, I thought

you were done.
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

If, in fact, South Carolina had

10

purported -- if the South Carolina Supreme Court had

11

purported to try to interpret this agreement as in some

12

sense reflecting a -- a consent by the parties to a

13

class-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer

14

case.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

court applied here.

18

QUESTION:

Well, what -That's not the standard that the

What if the South Carolina court in a

19

somewhat different case had said this arbitration is going

20

to be governed by our State rules of discovery.

21

parties have said nothing about it, but they just say, if

22

you're going to be bound by the laws of South Carolina,

23

that's what you're going to do.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:
Mr. Chief Justice.

The

Is that bad?

No, that's not bad at all,

The difference between that, of

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

course, is that is what you expect when you -- when you

2

consent to a bilateral arbitration arrangement.

3

say, we're going to proceed to resolve this dispute in an

4

efficient and economical fashion, you understand that that

5

means arbitration, however the -- however that gets played

6

out and, indeed, generally speaking, you would expect that

7

to be a question for the arbitrator, more than you might

8

as a matter of State law.

9

When you

The difference here, of course, is we're talking

10

about making a decision that's binding, or at least

11

purports to be binding on literally thousands of other

12

individuals who are not parties to this agreement, and

13

this goes --

14
15

QUESTION:

And who are not -- and who are not

objecting so far as I know.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Yes.
Well --

Green Tree is the one who's

objecting.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, we don't know whether they

21

objected or not.

All we know is that they received notice

22

and took no action as a consequence of it, but --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

Why -- please.
If you -- if you flip this case

around, in this situation, where the -- where the unnamed

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

members potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,500

2

of windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to

3

object, but what if the case had gone the other way.

4

if the arbitrator had issued a $1 nominal damage award for

5

each member of this class.

6

that the next day any of those unnamed class members could

7

show up and say, excuse me, I have a right under my

8

contract to choose my arbitrator in an agreement between

9

myself -QUESTION:

10

Yes.

What

Does anyone seriously doubt

Yes, one might doubt it if

11

their claim was worth $2, and it would cost them more to

12

go into court to make the objection.

13

action vehicle in some cases will make an action possible

14

that wouldn't be brought before an arbitrator before.

15

The --

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the class

Can I -- can I respond to that,

17

Justice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that

18

that simply reflects the manifest hostility to the

19

arbitration agreement as it's been -- as it's been written

20

by the parties here.
I mean, basically what we're talking about is,

21
22

we have a dispute.

It involves what will largely be a few

23

thousand dollars, potentially.

24

contract here involved $15,000 of -- in one case and

25

$7,500.

I mean, the entire

You expect the disputes are going to be

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

relatively small, and you expect that the parties are

2

going to choose an efficient method of trying to resolve

3

those cases and move on, and -- and they waive their right

4

to a public, or judicial review, because the theory is,

5

win or lose, it's worth taking the risk.

6

When you take that kind of a situation and you

7

convert it into a $27 million fine, nobody would agree to

8

that ab initio.

9

QUESTION:

Do you --

10

QUESTION:

That's true.

That's true, but what's

11

bothering me is exactly this point.

12

argument to this point.

13

possibly, consistent with section 2, interpret the word

14

arbitration in a contract to contain all the bells and

15

whistles of a court proceeding, because that would

16

transform the arbitration into a court proceeding, and

17

therefore they would have, in this subtle way, not only

18

have shown hostility to but destroyed the arbitration

19

contract, but what about this one.

20

arbitration?

21

I can understand your

A State, I don't think could

Is this hostile to

I have no doubt that Green Tree wouldn't have

22

agreed, in all likelihood, had they known what was going

23

to happen, and to that extent it is hostile to

24

arbitration, but the consumers on the other side might

25

have said, oh, we rather like it, in which case from their

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

point of view it isn't hostile to arbitration, so sort of

2

from one side it is, and from the other side it isn't, and

3

how do we decide whether, overall, it is or it isn't?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me that the linchpin

5

theory of the case ought to be the -- the point I started

6

with, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine

7

whether there is the consent of the parties or whether --

8
9

QUESTION:

No, but what we don't know here is

whether there is or there isn't.

We have silence, and

10

like many contracts that are silent, you have to impute an

11

intent, and what South Carolina did is --

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

QUESTION:

Well, what South Carolina did --

-- is, they imputed an intent.
-- they imputed an intent.

And they did it by a rule that says

16

that since the other parties in our minds would have

17

jumped for joy, and you, your client would have weeped in

18

dismay, we in that situation interpret the contract

19

against the drafter, which happened to be your client, so

20

they chose the other side and thereby concluded that it

21

was not hostile to arbitration, though it wasn't in the

22

interest of one of the parties.

23
24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it also doesn't reflect the

consent of both of the parties.
QUESTION:

Well --

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. PHILLIPS:
Justice Breyer.

That's the nature of consent.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

Both parties have to consent,

You -- you -You simply can't have unilateral

consent.
QUESTION:

6

The reason, as I understand it -- the

7

reason, as I understand it, you say there isn't consent

8

was the reason you gave in your answer to the Chief

9

Justice, that, in fact, they had agreed to be bound by

10

South Carolina law with respect to the interpretation of

11

the contract, but not with respect to the arbitration

12

clause itself, and my question is, how do you draw that

13

line?

14

applying the FAA and applying some State law.

15

be done.

There's nothing, per se, inconsistent between

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

That has to

Well --

So why do you draw --- South Carolina Supreme Court

19

drew that line.

20

specifically held that the parties agreed that the

21

arbitration clause would be governed exclusively by the

22

Federal Arbitration Act, and the --

23

The South Carolina Supreme Court

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, you say governed

24

exclusively by the FAA, in the sense that the FAA

25

naturally is going to trump any inconsistency with State

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

law, but here, there isn't a clear inconsistency with

2

State law, and the FAA is always applied with some State

3

law in mind.

4

and -- and therefore I -- I don't know how you can draw

5

this nonporous line between the FAA and arbitration on one

6

hand and State law on the other.

7

You have to have some procedure, and so on,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are two ways to get

8

there.

First of all, as a matter of just South Carolina

9

law we know that South Carolina's arbitration provisions

10

completely go by the wayside as a matter of State law.

11

Munoz held that several years ago.

12

there is no State law that is residual to it.

13

determined by the Federal Arbitration Act, which means

14

that the arbitrator is going to make certain kinds of

15

decisions.

If the FAA applies,
It is

But the -- I think the key line here is that

16
17

arbitrators are absolutely free to fashion whatever rules

18

they think are appropriate for resolving disputes in a

19

bilateral situation.

20

arbitrator get the authority to reach out to literally

21

thousands of other parties in order to resolve their

22

rights?

23

QUESTION:

The question is, where does the

Mr. Phillips, first, you're not --

24

you're not urging that there's any inherent inconsistency

25

between the arbitration and class action.

You concede in

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

your brief, I think, that if the parties agreed, yes, you

2

could have a class action in arbitration.
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg,

4

there is not a single example that I could identify of any

5

parties ever agreeing to go into a class action through

6

arbitration.
QUESTION:

7
8

in -- in arbitration?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Have there been no class actions

I'm sorry?

Have there been no class actions

in --

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Other than this one?

Yes.
There are in California, but

California and South Carolina are

15

that's -- that's it.

16

the only places, and the reason is, is that what you

17

create is this extraordinarily hideous hybrid kind of a

18

proceeding.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Does the AAA have no rules about -No.

-- class actions?

It's just

silent -MR. PHILLIPS:

Not as far as I know.

I mean,

24

they didn't file a brief in this case, but as far as I

25

know AAA doesn't have rules specifically dealing with it.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

They find it to be, as I understand it, quite burdensome

2

to try to figure out how to deal with it.

3

about it, this -- you're -- you're taking a dispute that

4

by its nature is supposed to involve a few thousand

5

dollars, converting it into $27 million.

6

this case alone --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

If you think

The costs in

Well, suppose --- were $36,000.

If the parties had chosen, say, a New

10

York forum -- I thought an arbitration agreement is

11

supposed to be a forum for action laws.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

Well, that's part of it.

If they said nothing about class

14

action and they chose New York as a forum, New York has a

15

class action vehicle.

16

could get a class action, is that not so?

17

They could get -- the plaintiffs

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, the difficulty with

18

that is that there's -- there's no State law in general --

19

I mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for

20

class actions with respect to arbitrations.

21

this is a hostile --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

That's why

But it -- it -- then arbitration is

something other than a mere choice of forum, because -MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, absolutely.

The Federal

Arbitration Act creates a substantive law of

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

arbitrability.

2

decisionmaking by the arbitrator.

3

limited role in some circumstances for State law, although

4

again South Carolina doesn't do that, but there -- there

5

is nothing that provides a mechanism for converting your

6

ordinary bilateral --

7

To be sure, it incorporates and embraces

QUESTION:

It recognizes some

Can I -- can I interrupt with this

8

question, Mr. Phillips?

Supposing you had the -- Green

9

Tree had agreements with a large -- large number of

10

consumers, and suppose 15 of them filed separate

11

arbitrations, they all went before the same arbitrator.

12

Could the arbitrator have entered an order saying, I think

13

it would be efficient to have all these cases tried

14

together, so I'm going to enter an order requiring you to

15

do so?

16
17

MR. PHILLIPS:

agreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator --

18

QUESTION:

19

Green Tree objects.

20

I -- I think if the parties all

Well, supposing the -- supposing
Could he nevertheless do it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I think in that situation

21

what you're then doing is depriving us of our right under

22

those agreements to choose our own arbitrator.

23

QUESTION:

Oh, but here -- here the South

24

Carolina arbitrator, which you -- you certainly consented

25

to his appointment, went ahead and did pretty much this.

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4
5

Well --

Not -- not as sweeping -This in a vengeance, I will say,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, but what is your -- what is

6

your principle objection to Justice Stevens' hypothetical

7

where the arbitrator simply says, I've got 15 of these and

8

I'm going to just try them together?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I have a substantial --

10

substantially less of an objection to that kind of a

11

procedure because it doesn't adjudicate unnamed parties'

12

rights, or purport to adjudicate those rights.

13

you have a real dispute that already exists --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

But --

16

sense consolidation.

17

Green Tree's right --

18

QUESTION:

At least

-- which can justify in some

I still think you have to respect

But then -- but you say your -- your

19

objection would have been cured if the arbitrator had

20

written a letter to every plaintiff and gotten an -- a

21

written okay, that would have made it okay?

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, because the -- the

23

arbitration process requires the filing of claims and

24

going through it.

25

QUESTION:

Well then, what's the difference

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

between that and my 15-individual case?
MR. PHILLIPS:

2

Because we don't know whether

3

there is, in fact, a dispute between the parties in the

4

absence of some effort by the plaintiffs to come forward.
QUESTION:

5

Well, they know there's a common

6

issue in all these cases -- I mean, they -- they all had

7

the same legal issue involved, didn't they?
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

But -- but it -- just because you

may have a right doesn't mean you necessarily care to

10

assert your right.

Again, it's -- it's easy to look at

11

this case and say, well, gee, there's an opportunity to

12

pick up $5,000 in windfall, or $7,500 in windfall, but you

13

know, an arbitrator could just as easily have rendered a

14

decision here that said, this is a pure technicality, it's

15

entitled to $1 in nominal damages, and the class-wide

16

relief ought to be $1,900, and attorney's fees ought to be

17

a third of that, which is $600 --

18

QUESTION:

And -- and --

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- and I guarantee you they would

20

not be willing or prepared to -- I'm sorry, Justice

21

Kennedy.

22

QUESTION:

Please, finish your answer.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

They would not be prepared to

24

abide by that.

Every one of the unnamed members would

25

say, I never had an opportunity to -- to participate in

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the selection of the arbitrator who has resolved my

2

substantial rights.

3

under these circumstances, and I'm going to show up and

4

make a claim.

5

QUESTION:

There's no basis at all to bind me

Well, the obvious solution to that

6

would be to read into their contract the idea that they

7

had agreed to that situation provided they're fairly

8

represented, et cetera, and if they don't like the result,

9

they can arbitrate that, too.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

But see, Justice Breyer, we -- we

11

keep making up more and more and more, and none of this

12

is -- is at all linked to any kind of consent among any of

13

these parties.

14

QUESTION:

I want to ask about consent.

At what

15

point and how did you first object to the class action?

16

Did -- did you instruct the arbitrator that we consented

17

to your appointment for individuals A, B, and C, but not

18

for other --

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, and the South Carolina

4

waiver and found that we never waived our right with

respect to that.
QUESTION:

6

But you did select the arbitrator.

7

It was your arbitrator.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

It was our arbitrator with

9

respect to the dispute with the Bazzles and the Lackeys

10

and the Buggses, to be sure, but we did not agree to an

11

arbitrator to resolve any disputes involving unnamed third

12

parties -QUESTION:

13

Well, it leaves this open, and I

14

mean, I agree with you that it is -- whether you did --

15

whether this or is not the proper interpretation of what

16

the parties intended is certainly disputable, and if it's

17

disputable, why shouldn't the arbitrator decide that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

18

See, I don't think it is disputed

19

what the parties -- what the parties intended, Justice

20

Breyer.

21

QUESTION:

Well -- well, wait.

You -- I'm going

22

to hear in about 10 minutes or so a pretty good argument

23

the other side, too --

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

Except that --

-- so that my question is, where you

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

have a contract that says, interpretations of the

2

contractor should be arbitrated, and where, in fact, what

3

we're arguing about today is how one part of the contract

4

should be interpreted, how did we get here?

5

that referred to the arbitrator?
MR. PHILLIPS:

6

Why wasn't

Because the question of whether

7

the arbitrator has the authority to resolve the rights of

8

unnamed third parties is not a question for the arbitrator

9

to decide.

That's a question for the court to decide.

Why?
Because it goes --

I would have thought the meaning of

It goes to the core of the

arbitrator's jurisdiction and authority to decide.
QUESTION:

No, but wait.

There is a case,

17

including one I just wrote, I think, for the Court which

18

makes very clear that what you send to the arbitrator -- I

19

mean, there are dozens of cases where you have a phrase in

20

a contract, and that's in dispute, and the parties have

21

agreed we send disputes about the meaning of the contract

22

to arbitration, you send that to the arbitrator.

23

I mean, the only things that you don't are

24

whether there's the arbitration contract is itself valid,

et cetera.

Is there any case you could cite -- I

opinion in the Howsam case.

QUESTION:

If you're concerned about the third

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you were going to allow

2

a class action in an arbitral forum you would certainly

3

want those -- those protections to be built in.

4

is, is that the way you get those kinds of protections to

5

exist in the ordinary class action is because the State

6

coerces the litigation.

7

cannot represent third parties, and the court has

identified as a matter of its power situations in which

it's going to embrace that approach, but that doesn't get

draw the line where you want us to draw the line as

opposed to drawing the line a little further and saying,

if you consent to arbitration and a State says, not

inconsistently with the FAA, arbitration can be done on a

7

should we draw the line to exclude that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

that.

Why

Well, there are two answers to

The premise of it, which is that the FAA doesn't

10

have anything to say about this, but the core principle of

11

the FAA is that there is supposed to be consent of the

12

MS. PILLARD:

Justice Scalia, the -- the

13

argument is that the arbitrator has the authority under

14

State law to interpret the ambiguity in the contract, and

15

it's not weird at all in this case, where, since 1979 in

16

South Carolina, arbitrators have had the authority to

17

consolidate arbitrations, and the leading cases, Champ,

18

the case on which Green Tree relies, Episcopal Housing,

19

which is the First Circuit case, the -- the cases that

20

look at whether this is allowed, advert to -- I'm sorry,

cases that allow class arbitration advert to the

MS. PILLARD:

8
9

This is an FAA preemption case,

but the FAA has nothing to say here.

The act doesn't say

10

anything about class arbitration, and the FAA ousts only

11

State law that is hostile to arbitration.
QUESTION:

12
13

hostile?

All right, well, why isn't this

It seems to me that is the question.

14

MS. PILLARD:

15

QUESTION:

It's not hostile --

Well, wait, let me give you an

16

example.

You would agree that the State couldn't

17

interpret silence as follows.

18

this contract, since it's silent, means that the

19

arbitration will take place at the bottom of a coal mine

20

The word arbitration in

We agree, right?

21

MS. PILLARD:

22

QUESTION:

All right, and what the other side

23

has said is, you know, in respect to one of the parties,

24

this is the same thing.

25

have agreed to arbitration if he knew that a class action

Of course my client would never

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

lawyer could find a provision in the contract that nobody

2

thinks really hurt them but, in fact, we didn't live up

3

to, and then obtain $10 million in a judgment before an

4

arbitrator, of which he gets three and the rest is

5

distributed.
Now, look, that's what we were trying to get

6
7

away from.

That's why we went to arbitration and not the

8

court.

9

of course reading such a thing into the silence is the

Of course we wouldn't agree to such a thing, and

10

same as putting us at the bottom of that coal mine, or at

least close enough so you cannot say that it is neutral as

to whether or not arbitration is good or bad or likely to

13

occur, or Volt was neutral or pro-arbitration.

rule is not neutral, it is hostile to it.

This State

Now, that's basically their argument, as I
understand it, and I'd like to hear the reply.
MS. PILLARD:

I think, Justice Breyer, that

18

misapprehends what we mean by hostile to arbitration.

19

Hostility to arbitration refers to State rules that are

20

suspicious of or undermine the ability of an arbitral

21

forum to resolve a dispute, and saying that a case is

22

going to proceed on a class basis is a far cry from saying

23

this case is going to proceed at the bottom of a coal

24

mine, where parties' rights would actually be -- would not

25

be able to be fulfilled.

That's the outside edge.

This

1

Court has -- has always said, well, arbitration can't go

2

forward if the parties can't get meaningful relief, and --

3

and I think your coal mine case would be such a case.
But what we mean by hostile to arbitration is

4
5

not whether one or the other party to the arbitration

6

wishes that they, in the end, once the dispute arises,

7

that they weren't before an arbitrator.

8

is, whether State law reflects a suspicion about the

9

capacity of arbitration to resolve a dispute, and if

10

No.

What we mean

anybody -QUESTION:

11

Could they -- could they then have a

12

State law that says, and the party that invokes the

13

arbitration in the contract will receive from the other

14

party a bonus of about $100,000 for having done a good

15

thing?

16

the coal mine, and all I've done is make sure that the

17

arbitration -- it's not -- it's not -- you see, it

18

satisfies your test.

19

See, that's equally ridiculous as to my example in

MS. PILLARD:

I -- I don't think it does,

20

because it's -- well, because it's -- it's targeted at the

21

arbitration, and if the State had such a rule one could

22

look at, what's the purpose, what's the legitimate purpose

23

of that rule --

24

QUESTION:

They love arbitration.

25

forget my ridiculous example.

Oh, but

MS. PILLARD:

It seems the -- well, that is --

3

is the focus.

4

not looking at ex post, once the parties are -- are

5

unhappy with the broadly worded contract --

6

The focus has to be whether the State law,

QUESTION:

Okay, I've got that.

Then do you

7

think -- the other question that's bothering me -- that

8

was one, and there's one other, is that we have the words

9

in the contract here, and the words are, the dispute, any

10

claim, including what the contract means, or the validity

11

of the arbitration clause, et cetera, shall be resolved by

12

binding arbitration, by one arbitrator, selected by us,

13

with consent of you, okay.

14

MS. PILLARD:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. PILLARD:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's the phrase.
Yes.

Now, there obviously is a

18

disagreement as to the meaning of that phrase.

19

shouldn't that be arbitrated?

20

MS. PILLARD:

21

QUESTION:

Well, why

Exactly, and it was.

All right.

Then what we should do in

22

this case is say, forget what the North Carolina Supreme

right the first time -- South Carolina Supreme Court.

2

Forget what they say.

3

parties mean, and therefore send it back to the arbitrator

4

for that determination, not influenced by the South

resolution, then?

MS. PILLARD:

QUESTION:

9

MS. PILLARD:

The question is, what did the

Now, is that the correct

No, Justice Breyer.

Because?
Because the arbitrator already did

10

look at this clause and decided that the -- that the

11

language of the arbitration agreement allowed him to

12

decide.
QUESTION:

13

I thought the first case was a case

14

where the South Carolina Supreme Court, Bazzle or one of

15

them was -- the South Carolina Supreme Court said what it

meant, not the arbitrator.

2

MS. PILLARD:

-- after both decisions were made,

3

and as an initial matter the Bazzle case went to the trial

court, which decided as an initial matter that the -- in

the Lackey case the -- the arbitrator made the decision as

an initial matter, looking at the language of the contract

and determining, without any prior judicial instruction on

the matter -QUESTION:

9

Not an instruction, but -- but was he

10

not guided or influenced in some way by the Supreme Court

decision?
MS. PILLARD:

12

Green Tree tries for the first

13

time in this Court to dispute that the arbitrator in

14

Lackey made an independent decision --

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MS. PILLARD:

-- that the contract authorized

class arbitration.

That argument is a complete red

herring.

a class-wide arbitration and certify a class.

QUESTION:

That was in -- that was in Lackey.

2

In Bazzle, did the arbitrator, after the, what I'll call

3

referral from the State trial court, did the arbitrator

4

then say, as an -- as an independent matter, I ratify, I

5

confirm, I -- I agree that the contract should be

6

interpreted this way, or does it -- or did he just say, I

7

am following the order of the court?
MS. PILLARD:

8
9

We don't have either precisely,

but let me tell you what I think is relevant to that.

The

10

arbitrator in Bazzle did also consider the issue.

11

issue was placed squarely before the arbitrator when Green

12

Tree moved him to decertify the class to grant that Green

13

Tree did fight this, a -QUESTION:

14

Wait, wait, wait.

The

Why -- why -- what

15

issue was placed before him when they moved to decertify

16

him?

MS. PILLARD:

They moved to decertify --

The issue of whether he would be

in -- in violation of the order of the South Carolina

20

Supreme Court?

MS. PILLARD:

Carolina Supreme Court at that time.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. PILLARD:

25

There was no order of the South

No.
There was only the order of the

trial court, which read the contract to allow class

Alderson Reporting Company

arbitration.

2

to the arbitrator, and then the issue was before the

3

arbitrator should he decertify the class, and Green Tree

4

argued that -- that they should.

5

Then it -- the class was certified and sent

Moreover, in Green Tree's motion to vacate the

6

award, after the arbitrator in Bazzle made the arbitration

7

award, they characterized the arbitrator as having made

8

the decision that the class could proceed in arbitration.

9

QUESTION:

I'm sure they did, so -- but my

10

impression is they appointed in Bazzle, the district court

11

appointed a class, or certified it.

12

MS. PILLARD:

13

QUESTION:

Certified a class.

All right, it was after that that

14

they go to the arbitrator in Lackey, and now what they're

15

telling us is, the arbitrator in Lackey, knowing that the

16

district court had appointed the class in Bazzle, then

17

appointed the class in Lackey, and what they say, I take

18

it, is well, that's not independent, he just thought

19

that's what he's supposed to do.

20

MS. PILLARD:

Right, and -- and I very much

21

disagree with that characterization of the record, and

22

I'll try to help to make it clearer.

23

First, as I pointed out, in their own briefs in

24

the South Carolina Supreme Court, they characterized the

25

Lackey arbitrator as having acted independently.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

There is

1

no -- no record support for Green Tree's current

2

assertions that the arbitrator did not make an independent

3

decision.

4

it, and it is not the case.

There is nothing in the record that supports

The arbitrator said that he determined that a

5
6

class action should proceed based on his careful review of

7

the broadly drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green

8

Tree.

That's -QUESTION:

9

Is there any history, Ms. Pillard, of

10

this in South Carolina, or is this the first time?

11

there been class proceedings before arbitrators in the

12

past?
MS. PILLARD:

13

Have

I'm not aware that there are,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

on that.

16

the --

17

for 20 years, and there have been a smattering of class

18

arbitrations in other places, and I -- I --

19

I'm not aware of any reported decisions

There have been class arbitrations in -- in

one of the largest economies in the world for --

QUESTION:

Ms. Pillard, when -- when a class

20

action is instituted, it seems to me it amounts to an

21

interpretation not just of -- of these contracts that were

22

in front of this arbitrator, but also of the other

23

contracts that have been brought into this arbitration,

24

and what I find it difficult to see is how any

25

interpretation of one of those other contracts would --

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

would allow them to be brought into this from the

2

standpoint not of this company -- this company at least

3

selected this arbitrator for these cases, and you could

4

say, well, they didn't select him for the other cases,

5

which may be a good point, but let's talk about the

6

customers, the plaintiffs.

7

They didn't select this arbitrator for any case,

8

not even -- not even for their own case.

They have had

9

foisted upon them not some Federal district judge who has,

10

you know, the -- the army behind him, but -- but some

11

arbitrator that, you know -- who knows who, that they --

12

they never selected at all.

13

them into this -- how can you possibly say that that

14

contract is reasonably interpreted to allow them to be

15

brought into this -- into this arbitration?

16

MS. PILLARD:

How can you possibly draw

I have two answers to that,

17

Justice Scalia.

First, there's no question that if, under

18

a contract that had a forum selection clause that said,

19

any disputes under this contract will be resolved in a

20

forum chosen by us with the consent of you, and a

21

plaintiff chose a forum and filed a class action and

22

offered opt-out rights to every absent class member who

23

wanted to opt out, and those absent class members were

24

bound by the same contract, their right to consent to the

25

forum would be protected.

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

QUESTION:

But that's deceptive.

They -- they

are summoned in by the power of the Government, not by --

3

not by their -- their contractual commitment to be

4

summoned in.

5

made part of a class action, so to say that you can do it

6

when the Government is coercing it, and therefore it's a

7

perfectly reasonable interpretation of a contract, doesn't

8

make sense to me.

Even if there were no contract they could be

MS. PILLARD:

9

QUESTION:

10

I --

Here, the only basis for getting --

11

for getting these plaintiffs into this court, or into this

12

arbitral court is their voluntary agreement, and their

13

voluntary agreement gave them the right to select an

14

arbitrator, and they have been deprived of that right

15

entirely.

16

MS. PILLARD:

I agree with you, Justice Scalia,

17

up to your last sentence.

18

that right.

Once they did that -- they drafted a clause which

In that case, you read this

have said, I'm -- I'm going to include in -- in this class

13

some people who don't have an arbitration contract at all?

14
15

MS. PILLARD:

those people were excluded in this case.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. PILLARD:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

I would think not, no, and indeed,

And -- and why is that?
Because they have --

Because the -- Green Tree did not

consent to that.
MS. PILLARD:

Because they have no -- the

21

arbitrator has no authority over them, because neither

22

they nor Green Tree consented to that, but by hypothesis,

23

if you had a clause --

24
25

QUESTION:

The hypothesis is, the consent must

be bilateral, and here it wasn't.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. PILLARD:

Oh, I disagree.

The consent was

2

bilateral.

Green Tree chose an arbitrator, and when it

3

chose an arbitrator for a case under a contract broad

4

enough to authorize class action, legally it has chosen an

5

arbitrator with the possibility that the class could

6

proceed.

Indeed, when they chose --

QUESTION:

12

MS. PILLARD:

14

It was -- they were

on notice --

11

13

-- the arbitrator, the case had

Yes.
-- of the possibility that this

issue would be litigated on a class basis.
QUESTION:

Well, they were on notice that

15

somebody wanted a class action, but it seems to me,

16

number 1, they were not on notice that South Carolina law

17

would provide a -- a class arbitration because, as you

18

said, it hadn't occurred before, and the only thing that

19

they definitely consented to was an arbitrator for this

20

case, and in a situation in which there was no existing

21

State law that put them on notice that they were in

22

jeopardy of this result, they're saying there are some

23

things we -- I think they're saying there are some things

24

we -- we agree that have to be filled in later about the

25

terms of the arbitration.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

But with no history to indicate that the request

2

for class -- or class treatment would be granted and would

3

be possible under South Carolina law, we surely did not

4

consent, we certainly did not take the risk that we

5

consented, that we were consenting to arbitration for all

6

of these other people, and if you doubt that, Mr. Phillips

7

says, just step back and -- and bear this in mind.

8

Without judicial review, would we have rolled the dice for

9

$27 million on one arbitrator?

What is -- what is your

10

answer to that, that it, in effect, it is just too

11

implausible to draw this conclusion out of the limited

12

consent that they gave?
MS. PILLARD:

13

I have several answers to that,

14

Justice Souter.

15

that a case with a large amount of money at stake, indeed

16

in Mitsubishi Motors with antitrust cases, in McMahon with

17

RICOs -- RICO and securities cases, large amounts of money

18

at stake, arbitration is permitted.
QUESTION:

19
20

First of all, this Court has never said

They --

Oh, no question about it.

It's a

question of what they plausibly consented to.

21

MS. PILLARD:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. PILLARD:

Right.

That's the point of his argument.
Right.

They were -- they were on

24

notice.

If they had good lawyers doing this, they would

25

have a long time before 1998 put in the simple one phrase

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that they put into their contract as of 1998 which says,

2

nobody who signs this can be a class member or a class

3

representative.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if they had been in California

5

they would have done that, but were -- were, you know,

6

were they on notice that they had better guard against

7

that jeopardy in South Carolina?

8

MS. PILLARD:

Yes.

I think in -- in particular,

9

the Episcopal Housing case put them on notice as of 1979

10

there were consolidations being permitted, and the courts

11

who were looking at the class question, the Champ court --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Consolidations aren't class actions.

I mean, those are quite different.
MS. PILLARD:

I agree with you, Justice Scalia,

15

but the fact of the matter is, the courts that have

16

decided whether or not to authorize class arbitration in

17

an appropriate case have looked as an analogy to the

18

consolidation precedent, so you have a jurisdiction in

19

which there is consolidation precedent, and parties, when

20

they agree to contracts in ambiguous terms, agree to

21

submit to the natural evolution of State law, and that

22

is -- that does on occasion present risks.

23

present risks, but they chose both to draft a clause very

24

broadly and to submit everything to the arbitrator.

25

QUESTION:

That does

Well, they're saying this isn't

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

natural evolution, this is creationism, and --

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

-- don't -- don't they have a --

4

don't they have a point that there is a distinction when

5

the difference gets to be that great?
MS. PILLARD:

6

No, and I -- and I certainly don't

7

think that is a preemption question for this Court.

8

certainly don't think so.
QUESTION:

9

I

No, no, but it says the terms have to

10

be -- I mean, it doesn't -- it says in the statute you

11

have to enforce the arbitration that they wrote, and

I do see the

I get

17

that.

18

the phrase, by one arbitrator selected by us?

19

around, we've been talking about that nonstop, but I -- I

20

don't have a clear answer to that, because what seems

21

absolutely clear in the case of Justice Scalia and me, and

22

he's never been in this courtroom, or in the arbitrator

23

room or anywhere, you know, I didn't select that

24

arbitrator.

25

If they don't opt out, they consent, but what about
We've come

I selected you for a different case.

Now -- now, how do we -- how do we square that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

with the words, an arbitrator selected by me, if I'm Green

2

Tree?
MS. PILLARD:

3

Because -- two reasons.

One is

4

that this was filed as a class action, so when they

5

selected the arbitrator they were on notice that at least

6

the plaintiffs were trying to do this.
QUESTION:

8

The second --

So if they said right at that point

we don't want this as a class action, then they win?
MS. PILLARD:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MS. PILLARD:

No.

No, okay.
The second answer is that the

12

contract was written in such a way as to be susceptible of

13

permitting class arbitration, so when they select an

14

arbitrator under this contract, they take into account,

15

this could be an arbitrator that could award punitive

damages.

front?
MS. PILLARD:

4

You may not have a class action.
Could they have said that up

I don't think so.

I don't think

5

so, because the -- the language of the contract and the

6

authority that they have given to arbitrators is

7

determined from the contract language, not from the

8

parties' choices at the threshold where a particular

9

dispute has already arisen.
QUESTION:

10

I -- I notice the -- none -- none of

11

your answers to these questions, including -- you had

12

several answers for Justice Souter.

13

said, well, you know, that's a very interesting theory,

14

Mr. Justice, but this is a State law matter, it's not for

15

you.

None of your answers

I -- I haven't heard that.
MS. PILLARD:

16

Well, I -- I intended to give --

17

to give that answer when I said this is not a preemption

18

question.

19

question, and I think that's exactly right, Justice

20

Kennedy, the narrow scope of FAA preemption focuses on

21

whether State law is hostile to the arbitration forum, to

22

the choice of arbitral forum to resolve ambiguities like

23

these.

24
25

It is not an FAA question.

It is a State law

There is -QUESTION:

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

have it in a class format, but that if any arbitration

2

clause -- any arbitration contract excludes class action

3

we will hold that against our public policy and

4

unenforceable?
MS. PILLARD:

5

One would have to look at the

6

reasoning of the State court in so holding.

7

reasoning was hostility to arbitration, trying to trade it

8

up --

9

QUESTION:

If the

Well, the -- the Supreme Court would

10

explain, we love arbitration, that's why we're not going

11

to let anybody make it a smaller arbitration, so that's --

12

so we're not being hostile to arbitration.

13

MS. PILLARD:

That is, as the South Carolina

14

Supreme Court made clear, not the issue in this case.

If

15

it were an application of general contract principles of

16

unconscionability in a particular case with no suspicion

17

of arbitration as such, then I think a State could do that

18

under State law.

19

If the State had a general law that applied to

20

litigation and arbitration against class action waivers,

not be hostile to arbitration for the State law to

override the parties' choice --

QUESTION:

What's your authority that -- that it

2

has to be -- you -- you seem to -- to be positing some

3

kind of a -- of an intent requirement on the part of the

4

State.

It has to really have it in for arbitration.
Why isn't the Federal Arbitration Act more

5
6

reasonably interpreted as directed at those State laws

7

that -- that are destructive of arbitration, that -- that

8

are -- are hostile not in the sense of any -- of any

9

mental intent, but that in their operation make it

10

difficult for parties to enter into arbitration

11

agreements, and if that's what it means, a law that

12

interprets a -- an arbitration agreement fantastically,

13

you know, down at the bottom of the coal mine, or, you

14

know, you -- you have to pay so many million dollars win

15

or lose, or, I think, you -- you have to subject yourself

16

to -- to class actions, is a law that is hostile to

17

arbitration, that is -- it is -- it is antagonistic to the

18

ability of parties to decide between themselves how, when,

19

and where and to what extent they will have an arbitrator

20

decide matters for them?
MS. PILLARD:

21

Justice Scalia, parties have an

22

ability to do that, and anyone who wants to put in a

23

clause saying, no class arbitration, is invited to do

24

that.

25

arbitration that broadly, as you just described.

This Court has never interpreted hostility to

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

What

1

this Court has said again and again is that the FAA

2

preempts only State laws that single out arbitration

3

provisions for suspect status that undercut the

4

enforceability of arbitration agreements.

5

Here, the arbitration agreement was enforced,

6

and there is no FAA rule, contrary to Green Tree's

7

contentions, that all arbitration agreements should be

8

enforced according to their written terms without the

9

benefit of State rules for resolving contract ambiguity.

10

Rather, as the Court reiterated in Waffle House,

11

absent some ambiguity in the agreement, it is the language

12

of the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject

13

to arbitration.

14

it is State contract law that applies, and it is State

15

contract law that resolves any contract ambiguity.

16

This Court has repeatedly made clear that

Green Tree is seeking a radical expansion of FAA

17

preemption.

Their rule would federalize countless

18

disputes over the meaning of arbitration clauses.

19

to arbitration will come and say, we never intended to --

20

to permit discovery, protective orders, various types of

21

motions, types of damages and the like that would invite

22

any party unhappy with the results of an arbitration,

23

saying we're getting into more than we thought, this is

24

hostile to arbitration as we prefer, to come to this Court

25

and ask it to second-guess ordinary State law

interpretation of an arbitration agreement.
This Court should not expand the scope of FAA

preemption in this case.
QUESTION:

4

There's no warrant for it here.

May I ask this, if you have another

5

moment:

6

because isn't it fairly clear that all the arbitration

7

agreements in the future will prohibit class actions?
MS. PILLARD:

8
9

Does this case have any real future significance,

Stevens, I agree.

It's really very limited, Justice

This case deals with whether this

10

particular agreement foreclosed class arbitration.

Green

11

Tree agrees that where an agreement authorizes it, class

12

arbitration can be done, and so all they're asking you to

13

do is to second-guess the State court's interpretation

14

applying the rule of construction against the drafter, and

15

I would very much dispute their characterization of what

16

the South Carolina Supreme Court did of applying a -- a

17

rule without any contractual or statutory directive to do

18

so.
The court was there quoting from a different

19
20

case, and this case is a fortiori.

Clearly, the court

21

looked and said, there's no specific directive.

22

preliminary matter, the court said, the contract is

23

silent.

24

trial court had relied on and said, there's affirmative

25

authorization here under the general language, and they

As a

Then they looked at the more general language the

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

looked at Green Tree's argument that the reference to this

2

contract foreclosed it, and the South Carolina Supreme

3

Court said, I find it ambiguous, and I'm going to apply

4

the ordinary rule of --

5

QUESTION:

Is there a risk that if we just did

6

what you said, they write in no class actions, a court

7

says this is a contract of adhesion, and that provision's

8

oppressive, and so we strike it?

9

MS. PILLARD:

It depends on why they think it's

10

oppressive.

If they think that waivers generally in

11

contracts, pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to

12

proceed as a class, whether the contract is an arbitration

13

agreement or not are oppressive, then I think it might not

14

be hostile to arbitration.

15

If they say, a waiver of a class action in an

16

arbitration setting is oppressive and unconstitutional,

17

that might run afoul of this Court's precedence in -- in

18

Casarotto.

19

QUESTION:

You really think that they could

20

allow a waiver of judicial review and disallow a waiver of

21

class actions?

22

And you think that wouldn't display hostility?

That would -- that would boggle my mind.

MS. PILLARD:

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, I

5

don't know precisely the first time that we raised this

6

issue, but I know that if you look at the record on

7

decision at pages 152 and again at 1539, in both Bazzle

8

and in Lackey, we say point blank the arbitrator exceeded

9

his authority to proceed as a class action, and that

10

neither Green Tree nor any of the unnamed class members

11

consented to have the arbitrator arbitrate their claims,

12

so we said it as plainly as we could with respect to

13

the -- with respect to the notion of consent.

14

The specific -- aside from that, the South

15

Carolina Supreme Court said we didn't waive our rights,

16

and it's quite clear that if we fight over these issues in

17

front of the arbitrator, we don't waive our rights.

18

was the holding of this Court in First Chicago.

19

That

Justice Breyer, with respect to whether or not

20

the arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority,

21

I think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case

22

have taken inconsistent positions.

23

respondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator

24

had no authority to go beyond the class certification of

25

the decision that had already been made by the State

If you read the

57
Alderson Reporting Company

1

court.

2

doesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for

3

the arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority,

4

because he clearly doesn't have the authority under this

5

contract to make a decision with respect to the third

6

parties.

7

Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day

That takes us to the question Justice Scalia

8

raised, which is, you know, what -- what do you do with

9

the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said

10

not word one about arbitrator selected by me?

11

nothing that interprets that language of this agreement,

12

and if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least

13

some component here to say, look, the terms of the

14

contract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by

15

the State court, those are rights that are there.

16

as plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and

17

the court rejected it.

18

There's

We said

And the final point I would make with respect to

19

hostility, while it is true that this Court has

20

consistently struck down efforts to be hostile to

21

arbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis

22

on which preemption will arise.

23

context exists in the same way it does in every other

24

context, does it interfere with the full achievement of

25

Congress' objections.

Preemption in this

That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the

58
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

answer to that here, and it's the same answer that would

2

arise if they were to -- if we had an agreement that said

3

class action has, that of course this is manifest

4

hostility to this arbitration agreement as written.

5

a bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme

6

Court had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it

7

would be judicially inefficient for us to have to go

8

through each one of these individually.

9

It's

Well, that's all well and good, but that's

10

coercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal

11

Arbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply

12

the consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the

13

South Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned.

14

Thank you, Your Honors.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you,

Mr. Phillips.
