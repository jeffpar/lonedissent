ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. HIGGINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court, counsel:
We are here today to obtain a construction of

13

the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, FTDA, that will keep

14

Federal trademark law in its proper bounds.

15

that can be accomplished by choosing objective proof over

16

supposition and inference to guide future FTDA cases.

17

This case from the Sixth Circuit involves a non-identical,

18

non-confusing trademark operating in the remote reaches of

19

the economy that was nevertheless enjoined under the FTDA,

20

and demonstrates the dangers of an unchecked FTDA.

21
22

QUESTION:

We submit

You mean Tennessee is remote, or this

particular business is?

23

(Laughter.)

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HIGGINS:

Kentucky.
Your Honor, this case actually

3

1

came from Kentucky, and --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HIGGINS:

4

Oh, well, Kentucky --

remote than Tennessee in some cases.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

-- I suppose that's even more

Was there a Victoria's Secret in this

town?
MR. HIGGINS:
this case.

There was not at the beginning of

The closest one was 60 miles away.

10

We say that the result --

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HIGGINS:

In Tennessee?

We say that the result below is

14

contrary to the actual words that Congress used in the

15

FTDA, namely the plain words, causes dilution.

16

result stands, the FTDA threatens to usher in an

17

anti-competitive expansion of trademark law into patent-

18

like realm.

19

If this

Perhaps the best example of that is the Second

20

Circuit's Nabisco decision, urged in part here by

21

respondents, which involved a goldfish-shaped cracker, and

22

it -- the court there applied the FTDA to grant

23

exclusionary rights in an unpatented, uncopyrighted design

24

of a product to enjoin a product that they said diluted.

25

That is contrary to this Court's two most recent decisions

4

1

involving Federal trademark law, the Wal-Mart decision and

2

the TrafFix Devices decision.

3

QUESTION:

Before you -- just would you spend

4

one minute -- it would help me a lot if you explained to

5

me what dilution is, and I'll be specific.

6

what you have here is a case of what's called tarnishment,

7

and what tarnishment -- what I think of is this, is it

8

like this, that -- that -- imagine some small shop wants

9

to start a bug spray business.

It seems to me

It's a funny example, but

10

it comes from an actual case, and they decide to call

11

themselves Bugwiser Bug Spray, and their slogan is, Where

12

there's life, there's bugs, all right.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

Now, Budweiser is not going to enter
Nobody thinks Budweiser, in fact,

15

the bug spray business.

16

is the source of the bug spray, but Budweiser has an

17

interest because the people who see this ad are going to

18

think Budweiser, yuck, and they don't want people to think

19

that.

20

encompass that, and my reason for thinking maybe it

21

doesn't is, the words of the statute refer to

22

distinctiveness of mark.

23

But -- is it -- so I want some explanation of what

24

dilution here refers to.

25

Now, is dilution encompassed?

MR. HIGGINS:

Does dilution

They don't refer to tarnishment.

There's a lot of people who want

5

1

explanation of what dilution is, and their tarnishment

2

aspect of dilution is part of the legislative history.

3

is not expressed in the words that Congress used to define

4

dilution.

5

the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish

6

the goods or services to which the famous mark --

It

Congress defined dilution as the lessening of

7

QUESTION:

But you believe --

8

QUESTION:

Which wouldn't include tarnishment.

9
10
11

Which wouldn't include tarnishment.

I mean, it can still

identify Budweiser beer very, very well.
MR. HIGGINS:

Well, it could identify Budweiser

12

beer, but the -- the -- our point about this case is that

13

there needs to be objective evidence that consumers, in

14

fact, identify the accused mark with the famous mark.

15

other words, we say that section 43(c)(1) of the FTDA in

16

its words causes dilution, imposes a causal connection

17

between the accused mark and the beneficiary.

18

QUESTION:

In

All right, excuse me, before you go

19

back to cause, which is your main point which I want to

20

hear, I do -- I'm assuming now that for purposes of this

21

case anyway, you concede that tarnishment is part.

22

don't concede that, or even if you do, will you please

23

explain as well what this -- what it is, what the injury

24

is where you're talking about a lessening of capacity to

25

identify and distinguish, what injury is that, if it is

6

If you

1
2

not tarnishment?
MR. HIGGINS:

Okay.

The injury in a dilution

3

case is focused, the courts agree, on the selling power of

4

the famous mark and the way that the cases go is that

5

everyone agrees that that selling power is the hook that

6

the famous mark --

7

QUESTION:

Okay, then please explain, putting

8

tarnishment to the side -- there is no tarnishment,

9

assume -- how does the fact that you have a tiny, totally

10

separate product with the same name ever, ever hurt the

11

selling power of the big famous name?

12

MR. HIGGINS:

The question becomes, again, one

13

of consumer perception.

14

gist of the FTDA.

15

power of the famous mark -- which the Fourth Circuit in

16

Ringling Brothers referred to as the economic value of a

17

trademark -- and I would agree with you, Justice Breyer,

18

that if there is no injury there should be --

19

All of that is tied up into the

What is being protected is the selling

QUESTION:

No, I don't understand conceptually

20

how there ever could be an injury.

I've got to understand

21

that first, and the reason is, I can imagine an injury

22

through tarnishment.

23

big product, Kodak, intends to enter the small area, the

24

Kodak -- whatever, monkey wrench -- and it is intending to

25

enter and draw on the selling power of, everyone thinks

I can imagine an injury where the

7

1

Kodak is good, so I can think of those two things, but

2

where they don't intend to enter, where there's no

3

tarnishment, what, in principle, is the harm that you say

4

we have to show really exists?

5

in principle, I can't tell if you're right.
MR. HIGGINS:

6

Unless I know what that is

It -- it would show whether or not

7

consumers would now identify a single mark with two

8

different sources, and -- and that is the essence of what

9

trademark dilution by the circuit court -QUESTION:

10
11
12

All right, and that is harmed

because?
MR. HIGGINS:

The theory is -- with which we

13

don't totally agree -- the theory is that consumers are

14

used to seeing only one Kodak, and now they see two, and

15

the theory is that that is the -- among a number of

16

metaphors, that is the first of a thousand cuts that will

17

lead to harm.

18

Now, our difficulty with that is that not every,

19

even identical use of the same trademark ultimately leads

20

to the dilution --

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, do you say that actual

confusion is relevant to the dilution analysis?
MR. HIGGINS:

Actual confusion is primarily a --

a Lanham Act infringement concept.
QUESTION:

So it's not, in your view, relevant

8

1
2
3

to the dilution?
MR. HIGGINS:

If there were actual confusion, it

might be relevant, but this case --

4

QUESTION:

5

Act was thrown out, in effect.

6

In this case, the other -- the Lanham

MR. HIGGINS:

That's the main point of this

7

case, is that the Court has ruled as a matter of law that

8

these accused marks by our clients are not going to lead

9

to confusion.

10

It is --

QUESTION:

And you say that actual confusion

11

doesn't matter, then, for purposes of this statute, the

12

dilution statute, or it could?

13
14

MR. HIGGINS:
circumstances.

I say that it could in some

It's not involved in this case at all.

15

QUESTION:

All right, now --

16

QUESTION:

You -- you -- go ahead.

17

QUESTION:

Then what about actual economic harm?

18

Is that a requirement, in your view, under this statute --

19

MR. HIGGINS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HIGGINS:

We think that --

-- for the plaintiff?
We think that the plaintiff in a

22

dilution case needs to show objective proof of dilution,

23

and that necessarily has an economic component with it.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but the statute does not, in

defining dilution, speak in terms of economic harm, does

9

1

it?
MR. HIGGINS:

2

The statute does not mention

3

economic harm per se, but it does say, the lessening of

4

the capacity of the famous mark to identify and

5

distinguish and, focusing on the selling power of the

6

mark, we say the best evidence that would be adduced in a

7

case of dilution is surveys of consumer perceptions of the

8

impact of -QUESTION:

9

That's the best evidence.

That's the

10

best evidence, but let's go back to what is -- causes

11

dilution?

12

Trademark Office does.

13

they're in use, so one might say, oh, the distinction

14

between causes dilution and likely to cause is, likely,

15

you're looking at the thing before it's ever used.

16

it's used, you're into the causes territory.

17

be a nice clean line to say that all that it means, all

18

that the difference in phraseology, causes dilution as

19

opposed to likely to cause, is, did it have -- a causation

20

case, you have to have a junior mark that's in use, so why

21

isn't that a satisfactory line between what's -- what

22

causes dilution as opposed to what is likely to cause

23

dilution?

24
25

One can distinguish what the Patent and

MR. HIGGINS:

That is, it considers marks before

Once

That would

We think that is not a completely

satisfactory distinction because of the language of the

10

1

statute that authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office to

2

look at a mark before it begins.
QUESTION:

3
4

7

They

can't judge it, because it's not -- it's not in use.
MR. HIGGINS:

5
6

Yes, well, that's likely to.

that.

And the statute actually says

Section -QUESTION:

But I'm asking you, getting out of

8

that territory, it can look at things before they're in

9

use, and now that -- now the junior mark is in use, why

10
11

isn't that enough to satisfy the dilution act?
MR. HIGGINS:

Well, we would agree that the

12

mark, the junior mark has to be in use, but we would not

13

agree that just by merely using a mark that is

14

semantically similar to the famous mark, that dilution

15

will inevitably result, which is the position of the

16

respondents here.

17

QUESTION:

But the one thing I think you're

18

asking for beyond Justice Ginsburg's example is, to take

19

the Kodak wrench and the Kodak camera, you're asking for

20

some proof that somebody heard the word Kodak and said,

21

was it the camera or the wrench? -- and if that proof

22

exists you've got your objective proof, and why do you

23

have to go to the point of saying that -- proving that

24

Kodak lost a sale as a result?

25

MR. HIGGINS:

We don't suggest that we have to

11

1

prove that Kodak lost sales.

2
3

QUESTION:
of some kind of --

4
5

But you're -- you're asking for proof

QUESTION:

That's the point of this, for

heaven's sake.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HIGGINS:

8

QUESTION:

9

see.

-- of economic consequence, and -We think --

-- I -- that's the point that I don't

If I understand it, the dilution occurs when -- or

10

that dilution is the process of lessening the capacity of

11

Kodak to identify the camera rather than to identify the

12

wrench.

13

begun -- that it is occurring -- why do you -- what is the

14

point of your argument that it has got to be carried

15

forward to the point of an economic loss of some sort?

16

If -- if it is shown that that process has

MR. HIGGINS:

Well, first of all we believe that

17

consumer surveys do have evidence of economic impact, and

18

we don't say that economic damage is required.

19

our position too far.

20

certified is whether the plaintiff must show objective

21

evidence of harm to the economic value of the famous mark,

22

not that it must show economic harm per se.

That takes

The actual question that is

23

I realize that's subtle distinction --

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, isn't there -- under the terms

of the statute, isn't that shown simply by the fact that

12

1

the consumer stops for a second and says, is it the

2

camera, or is it the wrench when the consumer hears the

3

word, Kodak?

4

MR. HIGGINS:

5

QUESTION:

I don't --

What further proof of loss of -- what

6

further economic proof is required to come within the

7

statute?
MR. HIGGINS:

8
9

proof.

That is not a complete economic

What we say is that not every, even identical use

10

leads to dilution in the minds of consumers.

11

as we put in our brief -- Delta Airlines, Delta Faucets.

12

Think of Apple Records, Apple Computers.

13
14

QUESTION:

Maybe because those are names that

are generic, like apple.

15

MR. HIGGINS:

16

Company and Ford Modeling Agency?

17

same result.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HIGGINS:

20

Think of --

Well then, how about Ford Motor
You know, that's the

How about Kodak Pianos?
Kodak Pianos is in the legislative

history as --

21

QUESTION:

Or Dupont Shoes, or Buick Aspirin?

22

MR. HIGGINS:

All of those are identical marks,

23

and we say that this case presents a non-identical mark.

24

There are semantic differences and there are gender

25

differences.

13

1

QUESTION:

Well, there is evidence -- or, at

2

least, how did this all get started?

3

Victor's Secret and writes to Victoria's Secret and says,

4

you want to stop these people, so we know that one

5

consumer, although he wasn't confused, said, they're

6

diluting your mark.

7

said, yeah, I passed this shop, Victor's Secret, and I

8

thought immediately of Victoria's Secret.

9

proof be sufficient and if not, why not?

Now, suppose you had 12 of those who

MR. HIGGINS:

10

Someone sees

Would that

We say it is not sufficient,

11

because the -- but that is essentially the analysis that

12

the Sixth Circuit put in there.

13

page 27a of the petition, the appendix to the petition,

14

that they are focusing on what a consumer is, quote,

15

"likely automatically to think," unquote, and then link

16

that to the famous mark.
QUESTION:

17
18
19

The Sixth Circuit said at

And what's your answer?

What's

your -MR. HIGGINS:

What our position is, that that

20

requires a court to guess whether the association that the

21

consumer thinks of is

22
23

QUESTION:

--

What do you want?

What do you want

in place of that?

24

MR. HIGGINS:

25

QUESTION:

What we would like --

What do you want the plaintiff to

14

1

show?
MR. HIGGINS:

2

We want the plaintiff to show that

3

there is objective proof of consumer perceptions that it

4

causes dilution, exactly what the statute says.
QUESTION:

5

I don't know -- what does that mean,

6

of consumer perceptions that causes dilution?

7

proof that a particular consumer, when he saw Victoria's

8

Little Secret -- or Victor's Little Secret -- had in mind,

9

gee, you know, that's like Victoria's Secret.

10

Objective

Is that

enough?

11

MR. HIGGINS:

12

QUESTION:

13

What does dilution consist of?

What is enough?

MR. HIGGINS:

14

No, that's not enough.

That's --

What is enough?

Dilution consists of a

15

consumer's -- the -- general consumers, not a single

16

consumer, but general consumer perception that there used

17

to be one Victoria's Secret and now, in their minds, there

18

are at least two.
QUESTION:

19

Well, how many consumers do you need?

20

You say one isn't enough , and you say general consumer

21

perception.

22

enough?

23

I mean, if you had 20 people would that be

MR. HIGGINS:

Well, the -- the record and the

24

briefs reveal some articles by trademark scholars who

25

discussed --

15

1
2

QUESTION:

Yes, but I was asking you a

particular question.

Would 20 be enough?

MR. HIGGINS:

3

I don't think so, Your Honor.

You

4

know, this -- we live in an age when consumer surveys,

5

voter surveys, public opinion surveys are done over a

6

weekend, and in this situation that is the kind of survey

7

that we would suggest.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

And what do you ask these consumers?

How many Kodaks are there?
them?

11

MR. HIGGINS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HIGGINS:

14

Is that what you want to ask

No, Your Honor.

What?
You ask them the scientifically

designed question.

15

QUESTION:

Which is?

16

MR. HIGGINS:

Which is, you know, do you think

17

of another famous mark, and do you believe -- as the law

18

review article suggests -- do you believe such things as

19

whether or not the new entrant had to get permission from

20

the famous mark in order to market this product.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that -- most consumers wouldn't

22

even understand that question.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. HIGGINS:

25

point, Your Honor.

And that's -- that's part of our

If --

16

1

QUESTION:

This sounds like a lawyer's dream.

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that the owner of

4

the senior mark is entitled to more protection than that.

5

I -- I just want to make clear, you do not contest that

6

tarnishment is a -- a basis for the respondent to prevail

7

in this case?

8

MR. HIGGINS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

We do not.

All right.

MR. HIGGINS:

As -- per se.

What we say is that

there is -QUESTION:

I -- I don't know why you need

13

sophisticated, so-called sophisticated polls to determine

14

whether there's tarnishment.

15

MR. HIGGINS:

Because, remember, this case is a

16

statute that is wholly different than the common law.

It

17

has no common law antecedent.

18

rights through Congress' action under the alleged use of

19

the Commerce Clause, and we say those property rights that

20

are being granted by this statute create rights that go

21

well beyond any trade area --

22

QUESTION:

It is granting property

It's not just beyond, I would have

23

thought that -- you don't make a point of it, so I might

24

be wrong -- there's a pretty significant speech

25

interest on -- on your side of the case.

17

That is, if this

1

statute gets out of hand, advertising is part of --

2

whether we like it or not -- our children's, anyway, daily

3

communications, and all of a sudden, if there's no real

4

harm you're going to cut off what people can say in

5

commercial contexts.

6
7

Now, you don't make much a point of that, so
don't let me put words in your mouth.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. HIGGINS:

Explain it to me.

We did mention that in our briefs,

10

but the primary people who are positing that position here

11

are the amici, who represent the public interest, and the

12

main point about this FTDA is that, other than bumping up

13

against the First Amendment, there really isn't a public

14

interest that is being expressed or applied here.

15

QUESTION:

Well, why -- why isn't there a public

16

interest in not having some organization like yours simply

17

copy another person's name?

18

MR. HIGGINS:

Well, we -- if there is that

19

situation, then that would be a case of trademark

20

infringement or copyright infringement.

21

not involve -- this case does not involve --

22

QUESTION:

This case does

No, Congress has gone further here

23

and said you can't simply copy someone else's name.

24

you say there's no -- maybe Congress shouldn't have done

25

it, maybe it hasn't done it, but to say there's no public

18

Now,

1

interest at all on that side doesn't make much sense to

2

me.

3

come off well in this case.

I mean, you -- you don't come -- your client doesn't

MR. HIGGINS:

4

Well, there is a public interest,

5

but that is addressed primarily on the free speech aspect

6

of things.

7

this case is that it requires courts to speculate whether

8

the beginning of a semantically similar mark is going to

9

inevitably lead to dilution, and that's contrary to the

10

We would agree with that.

The problem with

words that Congress used.
QUESTION:

11

You started off saying dilution,

12

you -- to show dilution, you had to show economic harm.

13

That I can understand.

14

some economic harm.

15

don't understand what your position is.

16

showing of economic harm, you know, the -- the mark is

17

worth so much less than it was, what precisely do you want

18

MR. HIGGINS:

We do demand that the plaintiffs

show that our mark is harming theirs in a dilution way,

done by consumer surveys.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

1

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

2
3

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you very much, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
What constitutes dilution, other than the

4
5

abstraction of the statutory definition perhaps is

6

reflected a bit in the examples we've given of consumer

7

surveys that might be used to produce evidence in a case

8

of this nature.

9

you associate with the name Victoria's Secret, and those

If consumers were asked what products do

10

who were aware of Victor's Little Secret answered it

11

substantially differently and included items found only in

12

that store and not in Victoria's Secret stores, or what

13

attributes do you associate with Victoria's Secret, and

14

those aware of Victor's Secret were more apt to say

15

tasteless rather than tasteful, which would -- might be

16

the response from those familiar with Victoria's Secret.
QUESTION:

17
18

not sure any more?

19

occurred?

What if the answer was simply, I'm
Would that show that dilution had

MR. WALLACE:

20

It -- it might.

All of these -- I

21

mean, we don't take the position that a consumer survey is

22

necessary in order to prove a case in the first place, but

23

I think the way a survey would be designed and what the

24

answers would show is illustrative of what constitutes

25

dilution.

21

1

QUESTION:

But you -- you would get that answer

2

from a consumer if you asked them about the word, Delta,

3

what products do you associate with the word, Delta, and

4

the consumer would say, airplanes, or air -- you know, air

5

travel and faucets, and there wouldn't be any dilution

6

there, would there?
MR. WALLACE:

7
8

Not unless their -- a conclusion

could be drawn based on other factors that -QUESTION:

9

Right.

MR. WALLACE:

10

-- a mark had established a

11

certain distinctiveness that is associated only with the

12

particular mark, and now that is being blurred.
QUESTION:

13

Well, I believe -- are you saying

14

that the Delta example is only good now, and that when the

15

person who made Delta Faucets first came out with a faucet

16

that he called Delta, or Delta Airline -- I don't know who

17

came first -- the chicken or the egg, the airline or the

18

faucet.

19

when somebody used the name Delta that the senior user of

20

Delta could have excluded the faucet-maker from -- from

21

Delta?

22

Whoever had the name first, are you saying that

MR. WALLACE:

Only under the Federal dilution

23

statute of '95 if the mark is a famous mark, and in the

24

Toro case that we cite, the --

25

QUESTION:

So I can't even have Delta Peanuts?

22

1

Once Delta is famous, just for air travel, I can't use

2

Delta for anything else?

3

the Federal statute?

4

MR. WALLACE:

5

QUESTION:

That would automatically violate

Well, not automatically, but if --

All you have to do is find a consumer

6

who knows of Delta Peanuts and says, you know, what do you

7

associate the name Delta with, and he says, airlines and

8

peanuts?
MR. WALLACE:

9

Well, that would involve an exact

10

replication of the mark, which are the only examples given

11

in the House report or in the legislative history, such as

12

Kodak Pianos.

13

similar marks rather than exact replications, and those

14

are much more problematical to ascertain whether there is

15

the kind of effect we're -- the act is concerned with.

Most of the cases, however, are about

QUESTION:

16

Mr. Wallace, at least in some of the

17

circuits, I'm not sure in the cases of this Court, correct

18

me if I'm wrong, I thought that in trademark infringement

19

cases, that the circuit court said that they have certain

20

de novo authority.

21

erroneous, but the conclusions that you draw from the

22

historical facts give them certain powers of de novo

23

review.

24

circuits, is it not --

25

MR. WALLACE:

Historical facts are clearly

That's the prevailing rule in many of the

Yes.

-- in infringement cases, and

shouldn't that same rule be applied here?

to know what dilution is or is not if we have certain

historical facts.

It is very difficult.

I mean, judges

We don't

There are other factors that

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you something

13

to clarify the Government's position on this?

14

been listening to the argument, Mr. Higgins says you look

15

to see, he said, if before you thought there was one

16

Victoria's Secret, now you thought there were two.

17

suggesting that the association -- it's not what you think

18

of when you see Victor's Secret.

19

Secret, of course you're going to think of Victoria's, but

20

what counts is, when you think of Victoria's Secret, do

21

you think of Victor's.

22

and if it's the latter, then it's -- those are two very

23

different things, aren't they?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

As I've

He's

When you see Victor's

That's -- that's what dilution is,

Yes.

Dilution is about dilution

of the famous mark and its capacity to distinguish the

24

1

particular goods or services, but we think the court of

2

appeals was wrong in saying that mere mental association

3

of the two marks by consumers automatically results in

4

dilution.
QUESTION:

5

But the court of appeals was going

6

on, when you think of Victor's you think of Victoria's.

7

I'm asking you, is the right question -- is the necessary

8

question of the customers -- when you think of Victoria's,

9

do you think of Victor?
MR. WALLACE:

10

I think the -- the question is not

11

do you think of Victor's, but when you think of

12

Victoria's, do you think of more than what Victoria's

13

Secret --

14

QUESTION:

Right.

15

MR. WALLACE:

-- itself has as its merchandise

16

and image.

17

type of product that may change their renown or cachet

18

with customers.

19

Is their name now associated with a different

QUESTION:

Is there -- what is the extra -- I'm

20

not -- if you're finished with that question, I'd like

21

to -- which I think there's a lot to.

22

particularly the harm?

23

thinks -- either customer -- thinks of the other even if

24

there's no specific tarnishment, and there's no general

25

tarnishment?

Is -- what is

Is it just that the customer

That is, people associate Buick with a good

25

1

car, and we can measure whether that's identical before

2

and identical after, and it is, so there's no general

3

tarnishment, there's no bug example tarnishment, there's

4

nothing but the fact that on Justice Ginsburg's question,

5

both sides say yes.
Now, is that harm under this statute?

6
7

dilution, or isn't it?

8

MR. WALLACE:

9
10

Is that

We don't believe that in itself

constitutes dilution if there is none of the damage to the
ability of the mark.
QUESTION:

11

The -All right, so -- so the ability of

12

the mark consists either of my bug example, or some

13

general weakening of the goodness that inheres in the

14

name.

Anything else?

15

MR. WALLACE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WALLACE:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WALLACE:

Well, yes -- no, I think --

No, okay -I think the Fourth --

The answer's no.
The Fourth Circuit case of

20

Ringling Brothers was very illustrative.

21

associate Utah's use of Greatest Snow on Earth with

22

Ringling Brothers' use of Greatest Show on Earth, but if

23

they keep the two distinct in their minds, even though

24

they recognize that it's a play on the same words, but

25

they think the two trademarks refer to different products

26

People might

1

and services, then there -- no harm is done to Ringling

2

Brothers as the Fourth Circuit held, and the Fourth

3

Circuit even suggested that perhaps they even benefit from

4

having people think additionally of their mark.

5

question on which the Patent and Trademark Office has not

6

taken a view, but the harm has to be that consumers are --

7

are diminished in their capacity to recognize the mark

8

that is the famous mark that's being protected.

9

QUESTION:

That's a

That's -- but that's confusion.

I

10

mean, if -- if there's confusion, you don't need this new

11

law.

12

with a Kodak Piano, even if nobody in the world thinks

13

that Kodak, the photography company has anything to do

14

with Kodak Piano, the mark has nonetheless been

15

diminished.

I thought that it was the case that if you come out

MR. WALLACE:

16
17

Isn't that right?
That's true, at least when it's an

identical mark, or one that's so confusingly similar -QUESTION:

18

But that goes to the very point

19

you've just been talking about, and contradicts what

20

you've said.

21

confusion or not, you can't use Kodak.

It doesn't matter whether there's any

MR. WALLACE:

22

There -- there has to be confusion

23

as to the mark, rather than as to the source of the

24

product.

We'll hear argument from you now, Mr. Dellinger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question on which the Court granted

6
7

certiorari was whether the plaintiff must demonstrate that

8

it has already suffered economic injury as a precondition

9

to any and all relief under the 1996 act.

The text of the

10

act answers that question, and answers it no.

11

simply no such requirement included in the statute.
QUESTION:

12

There's

Well, it -- I mean, that's to some

13

extent a play on words.

It depends on what you mean, has

14

actually suffered economic injury.

15

counsel says now is that all he means by, has actually

16

suffered economic injury, is, has suffered dilution, has

17

actually suffered dilution of the mark, which, of course,

18

entails economic injury.

19

was worth a lot, and it's now diluted, there's economic

20

injury.

What your opposing

If the mark is diluted, the mark

Now -MR. DELLINGER:

21

Justice Scalia, we agree that

22

the act requires a showing of actual, present dilution,

23

and that such a showing was, in fact, made below.

24

dilution?

25

best understood in light of the fact that this is a very

What is

A number of you have asked that question.

28

It's

1

narrow statute that only protects a few very famous marks.

2

I do not think, for example, Justice Scalia, that Delta

3

would qualify as a famous mark because it has been used so

4

often in other third party uses.
QUESTION:

5

The --

But what about the first time it was

6

used either for -- what is it, the airline, and what's --

7

faucets?

8

it was used for the second product?

9

MR. DELLINGER:

10

Whichever came first.

What about the first time

Then it would not suffer the

disqualification that would come as to what is present --

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MR. DELLINGER:

-- about proliferating uses.

13

Whether it would otherwise satisfy that would remain to be

14

seen.

15

narrow the application of this statute by taking very

16

seriously the requirement that it has to be a truly famous

17

mark that has.

I think that the Court can, and the courts can

18

Take the example that was given to the House --

19

QUESTION:

Well, let's -- and keep it so I can

20

understand it.

Let's assume the first use was Delta

21

Airlines.

22

starts advertising Delta Faucets.

23

famous enough --

Everybody recognizes Delta Airlines.

24

MR. DELLINGER:

25

QUESTION:

Was Delta Airlines

I don't know --

-- on your criterion?

29

Somebody

1

MR. DELLINGER:

-- on those facts.

I'd have to

2

know whether, if -- as it is today, yes, I would think if

3

it -QUESTION:

4

All right.

Let's assume it's famous

5

enough.

The ads start going out in the magazines for

6

Delta Faucets.

7

suffered any tangible damage at this point, but there is

8

proof, let's assume from a survey of magazine readers,

9

that when they see the word, Delta, standing by itself,

There is no proof that Delta Airlines has

10

they're not sure who the source of the product is.

11

that dilution?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

Is

If they're not sure who's the

13

source of the product, it may be infringement, and the

14

reason I resist the use of Delta is that a lot goes into a

15

determination of whether -- as it did in this case -- as

16

to whether a mark has those special qualities that mean

17

that the second or junior user and the third, fourth, and

18

fifth are lessening its capacity to communicate these very

19

distinctive ideas.

20

The example used in the House report was

21

Tiffany's, for example.

We all know that if another

22

jewelry store starts as Tiffany's you've got an

23

infringement claim, because consumers would be confused,

24

but as the House was told, what about a Tiffany's

25

Restaurant, and that means that Tiffany's used to stand

30

1

for one thing, it now stands for two, but here's the

2

absolute heart of the matter, where the FDA comes into

3

play.
QUESTION:

4

That was bad?

I mean, you see, I am

5

so far behind understanding you that I don't know whether

6

you have just asserted that that's obviously bad.

7

you have.

Tiffany's Restaurant is bad.

8

MR. DELLINGER:

9

QUESTION:

MR. DELLINGER:

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

14

Yes.

Okay.

10

13

I think

I have, and --

And the difference between Tiffany's

Restaurants and Delta Faucets is what?
MR. DELLINGER:

There may be no difference.

I'm

15

assuming that both -- if you assume that both Delta and

16

Tiffany's are famous marks.

17

QUESTION:

Okay.

18

MR. DELLINGER:

But here's why Delta Faucets and

19

Tiffany's -- if the original marks are famous -- both

20

constitute the harm of dilution.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DELLINGER:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. DELLINGER:

25

Dilution --

You mean, just using the name?
Just using the name --

Is likelihood of dilution enough?
No, not under the act, and --

and nor is just using the name enough, nor is just

31

1

semantic similarity.

2

proof that it actually -QUESTION:

3
4

That it causes dilution for

everybody -MR. DELLINGER:

5
6

You have to make out the statutory

dilution --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DELLINGER:

9

It causes dilution, and

association.

Is expressed -It's creating a mental

Similarity is not enough.

But take an

10

example that shows how critically important stopping the

11

first use is.

12

then you can also have a Tiffany Shoe Store, a Tiffany Pet

13

Store.

If you can have a Tiffany's Restaurant,

Very soon Tiffany's no longer --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DELLINGER:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. DELLINGER:

18

QUESTION:

19

don't say so what facetiously.

20

to identify the harm specifically that that's likely to

21

bring about to the first owner.

22

Where will it all end?
Where will it all end?

That is exactly --

Well, so what?

MR. DELLINGER:

So what?

I mean, I

I say so what to get you

Exactly.

The -- what Congress

23

saw as the harm, Justice Breyer, for truly famous marks,

24

to quote from the House report itself, is that dilution

25

applies when the unauthorized use of the famous mark

32

1

reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies

2

something unique, singular, or particular, so that

3

Rolls-Royce, which once stood for one thing, once it's on

4

100 products or 1,000 products no longer identifies and

5

distinguishes -QUESTION:

6

No longer identifies one thing.

It

7

now identifies a thousand things, and that, of course, is

8

true by definition, and what I'm trying to get at is, why

9

is that bad?
MR. DELLINGER:

10
11

was bad because -QUESTION:

12
13

Congress determined that that

ahead.

Just automatically?

Why?
MR. DELLINGER:

14

Oh, no, go

Congress determined that that

15

was bad to the extent that the mark no longer stood for

16

something singular or particular, no longer conveyed -QUESTION:

17

Then again, that's just another way

18

of repeating the same thing, and the reason that I think

19

it's important is, perhaps we can survive with only having

20

one Tiffany's, but let's think of some slogans out of my

21

youth, you know.

22

pure.

23

just repeating slogans from old radio programs, and the

24

reason that I'm doing it is because I want you to see

25

immediately, as soon as you depart from a word like

It floats.

99 and 44/100th percent

The beforehand lotion, whatever that meant.

33

I'm

1

Tiffany's, which is totally arbitrary or fanciful, and you

2

get into actual advertising slogans, you will tie up free

3

speech in lawsuits like mad, and that's what's worrying

4

me.
MR. DELLINGER:

5
6

the case.

7

to extend a wide --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DELLINGER:

10

No, I do not -- it is not at all

Congress made it clear that safe harbors were

QUESTION:

Yes, the safe harbor is fair use.
And it --

Fair use, and that's what's again

11

worrying me, because those two words, fair use to me spell

12

lawyers, lawsuits, uncertainty and confusion.

13

MR. DELLINGER:

If you lose distinctiveness,

14

what you lose is the selling power of the mark.

15

Rolls-Royce stands for something important.

16

something that consumers -- it signals to consumers.

17

Rolls-Royce is very careful about what products it

18

allows to --

19

QUESTION:

Chevrolet doesn't matter.

20

use Chevrolet, because that's --

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

23

It conveys

Is that right?

You can

Or Edsel, even

easier -- yes.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Scalia, it is -- when

34

1

you look at whether a mark is famous -- and in this case,

2

it's simply not contested.

3

behind Levi's and ahead of Rolex on the -- on the list,

4

but when you contest that, you do look at a number of

5

factors, so you can't stand here and pick out any one, and

6

that's a -- that's an important gatekeeping function to

7

narrow this statute.

8

Now --

9

QUESTION:

This is a mark that comes in

When you say it signifies something

10

distinctive, you don't mean that Buick signifies cars, you

11

don't mean that Tiffany's signifies jewelry, you don't

12

mean that Rolls-Royce signifies sedans, right?

13

MR. DELLINGER:

Not just that, but a certain

14

mark and quality and kind of product is exemplified, and

15

that's what makes a mark famous.

16

It gives it this.

Now, if -- we know that these marks have value.

17

When -- when companies are acquired, often as much as

18

four-fifths of the value may go to use that name.

19

something quite valuable, Justice Breyer, and its value is

20

going to be lost --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DELLINGER:

23
24
25

Fine.

That is

Why not --

-- if there are a thousand

different ones.
QUESTION:

Why not require some proof of that?

That is, some proof that this mark -- which not only

35

1

identifies a wonderful car, but now has come to stand for

2

wonderfulness in general -- some proof that because

3

somebody's using it on a tricycle, that people think it's

4

a little less wonderful.

5

Now, that's not -- that's hard to prove one way

6

or the other, but not -- I mean, requires some reason for

7

thinking that.
QUESTION:

8

So Pepsodent would lose, or, you

9

know, just some -- some product --

10

MR. DELLINGER:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

That's just a -- you know, it's an

12

ordinary product.

How can you have an absolutely

13

wonderful toothpaste?

14

QUESTION:

Oh, no, you can.

15

QUESTION:

There's no Tiffany of toothpastes,

16

You can.

right?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DELLINGER:

19

QUESTION:

There is no --

So we're only talking about

20

Tiffany's, Rolls-Royce, a couple of other really, really

21

quality names.

22
23
24
25

Is that what the statute was directed at?

MR. DELLINGER:

I believe that is the case,

Justice Scalia, that -QUESTION:

But you don't differentiate between

Cadillac and Chevrolet, do you?

Chevrolet would have just

36

1

much cachet -MR. DELLINGER:

2

No, I think they would be on

3

similar footing, and Chevrolet has its own kind of appeal.

4

It appeals to -- for those of us who live in NASCAR

5

country, there is sometimes a more appealing image to

6

Chevrolet than to Cadillac.

7

judgments.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Well, Mr. Dellinger, why isn't it

useful to think in terms of whether there's proof of some
diminution of value of the mark?
MR. DELLINGER:

11
12

I don't mean to make value

That is a very good question,

and that is Justice Breyer's question for --

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. DELLINGER:

We believe that obviously the

15

mark does suffer in value if you make out the finding of

16

dilution.

17

actual --

18

The Fourth Circuit would require you show

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you wouldn't think we

19

should just presume a diminution in value, would you,

20

because the mark is similar?

21

MR. DELLINGER:

No, but what you -- what you

22

presume is that the economic injury that you're talking of

23

may not be identifiable -- often would not be

24

identifiable -- until it's too late to rectify the harm

25

that has been done.

If you think of -- we usually use as

37

1
2

examples where there is one other competing user.
What faces the sort of in-house intellectual

3

property counsel for a company with a famous mark is that

4

there are users popping up all over the country all of the

5

time, so that if the first user, say Victor's Little

6

Secret, exists in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and if you

7

can't show that that alone produces the kind of harm

8

you're looking -- or that your question would imply one

9

might be looking for -- how can you stop the second, the

10

third, the 500th use?

11

At what point -- there's no privilege for the

12

first user, so that by the -- here's what would happen.

13

By the time you could show economic damage to the harm,

14

first of all as a matter of law you might have lost the

15

status as a famous mark because there are all those users

16

out there.

17

Secondly, the -- it is not clear why you would

18

prohibit the 500th user of the mark, the 500th different

19

kind of store when you allowed the first 499 to go on, so

20

that -- you ask the question of whether, at present, this

21

use lessens the capacity of that mark to identify and

22

distinguish.

23

QUESTION:

Focusing on the present, suppose I'm

24

a trial judge, and this case comes to me in the pretrial

25

conference stage, and I say, you know, it does seem to me

38

1

that this second -- this junior user is going to tarnish

2

the image of -- of the senior user.

3

say, and then I -- what do I put down when I write an

4

opinion so that the circuit court can review my thinking?

5

I mean, what -- what do I put down?

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Is that all I need to

Well, I think this case is a

7

very good example, because you have a court which goes

8

through a list of factors to reach a conclusion.

9

opinion is rather short, but that's because the conclusion

The

10

in this case is so close to being a core example of the

11

statute.

12

distinctive mark, the degree of similarity, the proximity

13

of the product lines helping to create that association,

14

the shared customers -- 39,000 catalogues distributed in

15

Elizabethtown.

They -- they mention the fact that it's a very

The suggestion is there are some --

16

QUESTION:

39,000 in Elizabethtown?

17

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

There are 39,000

18

Victoria's Secret catalogues distributed in Elizabethtown,

19

Kentucky in 1998.

20
21

QUESTION:

What's the population of

Elizabethtown?

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. DELLINGER:

That is a good question, but

24

I -- four, he says, but I think that's his guess.

25

don't know.

I --

39

We

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. DELLINGER:

I -- I -- think it is

3

substantial.

Now, once you have these other uses out

4

there, particularly if it's a -QUESTION:

5

So what do I -- would this be

6

appropriate for a summary -- would you urge me to take

7

this on summary judgment?
MR. DELLINGER:

8
9

QUESTION:

All I need to know is the number of

catalogues, how well-known the mark is, and that's it?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

Absolutely, just as I think you

could, Justice Kennedy --

10
11

I --

What you have to --

And then my own judgment as to what

tarnishment is?
MR. DELLINGER:

15

No, because here you have --

16

here you have an actual association.

17

this case, for example, that the judge relies upon, is not

18

a survey.

19

What you have in

It's proved by actual consumers.
QUESTION:

Well, but suppose right here, to take

20

this case, that the people who go to Victor's who have

21

ever heard of it honestly do not believe the less in any

22

respect whatsoever of Victoria's Little Secret, and the

23

people who use Victoria's Little -- I mean, why should

24

they? -- and the people who use -- go to Victoria's Little

25

Secret have never heard of Victor's, so you -- why -- why

40

1

suppose they come in and show that?

2

QUESTION:

You're confusing the marks.

3

QUESTION:

Now, why -- I

4

confusing the marks.

5

No.

understand you're

No, you're not confusing the marks.

I'm -- he's saying I'm confusing the marks.

6

(Laughter.)

7

QUESTION:

But I -- did I have it backwards?

8

QUESTION:

Yes, you did.

9

QUESTION:

Not Little -- all right.

The people

10

who go -- no, the customers of Victor's do associate

11

Victor's with Victoria, but they think nonetheless of

12

Victoria.

13

don't know what they think, but it's not negative in any

14

respect, and the people who go to Victoria's, to use

15

Justice Ginsburg's example, don't care, or don't know, or

16

they've never heard of Victor's, so although there is --

17

in a subset of people -- an association of the name, there

18

is no harm of any sort whatsoever, and they will prove

19

that.

20

They might even think more of Victoria.

I

Should they not have the opportunity to prove it?
MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Breyer, Congress simply

21

did not agree that no harm has been done when the famous

22

mark loses its singularity, and remember, if there can be

23

one store under Victoria's -- under Victor's Little Secret

24

in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, there can be a thousand

25

opening the Monday after Superbowl Sunday.

41

1

QUESTION:

So then in your view, anyone who

2

starts going around for a commercial reason and using the

3

two words, it floats -- it floats -- where they want

4

people to think of Ivory Soap, they are open to a lawsuit,

5

and they have to rely on a fair use defense, or are there

6

other defenses?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DELLINGER:

The --

Is my example wrong?
Well, it's -- your example is

10

that there is a -- you're suggesting a mere mental

11

association.

12
13
14

I'm not sure your --

QUESTION:

Well, in a commercial context -- in a

commercial context where people are polled -MR. DELLINGER:

Secondly, I am not -- by no

15

means -- it would take a lot to persuade me that it floats

16

is a truly famous mark deserving of this protection, but

17

Congress believed that the harm is that if you have a

18

mark, and Congress identified marks like Buick Aspirin,

19

but if you -- the very harm Congress sought to prevent is,

20

when a mark stands for one thing -- this narrow set of

21

truly famous marks -- and you have replicating uses, it is

22

no longer going to stand for anything in your mind, and

23

Congress believed, and the market reflects, that that is a

24

true loss.

25

Now, if you wait to try to -- to where you could

42

1

show, as the Fourth Circuit would require, an actual

2

revenue loss, you can't unring the bell, particularly with

3

tarnishment.

4

If someone opened up --

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, can I just clarify,

5

then, it doesn't make any difference that this particular

6

shop happens to sell sex toys.

7

Victor's Secret could sell men's underwear and your

8

argument would still be the same, am I right?

9

out the tawdriness or the disparagement or the

It could just as well --

So we get

10

tarnishment.

11

underwear, men's underwear, and it's got the label,

12

Victor's Secret.

13

It's just -- it's a store, it sells

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

14

entirely agree with that.

15

of the Victoria's Secret name through blurring would be

16

sufficient, but in this case, you don't have to rely upon

17

that, because the court below did find that there was

18

tarnishment when a name not only ceases to stand for one

19

thing, but is associated --

20
21
22
23

QUESTION:

But how does tarnishment fit the

language of the statute?
QUESTION:

We do believe that the dilution

That's what --

Yes, I'd like to know that, too.

I

don't see how tarnishment -- you know --

24

QUESTION:

25

mark to identify --

Does that lessen the capacity of the

43

1

MR. DELLINGER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, it does, and the --

I thought it just changed the

3

reaction to the mark, rather than lessening -- I mean, you

4

know, you have an unfavorable reaction, rather than not

5

knowing what you're talking about.

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Let me just quote you from the

7

treatise, one sentence from the McCarthy treatise.

One of

8

the classic functions of a trademark is to signify that

9

all goods and services sold under the mark are of equal

10

quality, or of a special quality.

11

identifying and distinguishing a mark.

12

is lessened.

13

distinguish a particular mark when that mark is tarnished

14

by what the trial court found some customers would find to

15

be an unsavory association.

It -- the capacity

It lessens the capacity to identify and

QUESTION:

16

That is part of

I don't understand -- you can say it,

17

but I don't understand it.

18

distinguish Victoria's Secret, but I just think less of

19

it.

20

MR. DELLINGER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

I can still identify and

Well, --

It -- it doesn't -- any -- it isn't

any less identifiable.
MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Scalia, I think you're

misstating the statute.
QUESTION:

Okay.

44

1
2

MR. DELLINGER:
identify and distinguish.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DELLINGER:

It's not whether you can
It's whether the mark's --

Yes.
-- capacity to identify and

5

distinguish is lessened, and if it no longer stands in

6

one's mind --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DELLINGER:

9

I'll take that.
If it no longer stands in one's

mind, or in the mind and the public perception for the

10

same connotation of quality as it did before the

11

association with the unsavory image, its capacity to

12

identify and distinguish that quality has lessened, but

13

moreover -QUESTION:

14
15

But you have to add the word quality

to the statute.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

The statute doesn't contain that

18

word.
MR. DELLINGER:

19

The statute uses dilution,

20

Justice Stevens, as a term of art, and nothing could be

21

clearer than that Congress thought that term of art,

22

dilution, encompassed both blurring and tarnishment, as I

23

think --

24

QUESTION:

Well --

25

MR. DELLINGER:

I may not persuade Justice

45

1
2

Scalia -QUESTION:

Nothing could be clearer than that

3

Congress adopted a definition of what -- of what dilution

4

consists of and, to my mind, that definition does not at

5

all cover disparaging the other product.

6
7
8
9

MR. DELLINGER:
otherwise.

The House report says that the definition --

QUESTION:

The House committee thought

otherwise.

10

MR. DELLINGER:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, it -- Congress thought

Yes.

What Congress thought was the

definition that Congress adopted.
MR. DELLINGER:

And the definition of lessening

14

the capacity encompasses that, but in any event, since

15

blurring is still present, this is thought to be an easy

16

case by the courts below, for -- for good reason.

17

imagine hundreds of different users of the Victor's Little

18

Secret mark, the uniqueness, the quality, the public's

19

perception is going to be lessened.

20

If you

Congress further -- to go back to a question

21

asked by Justice Breyer -- made it absolutely clear that

22

it wanted the safe harbors read as broadly as possible to

23

ensure that there was no restriction on First Amendment

24

rights, so the courts are warmly invited to create as

25

large a safe harbor for parody.

This is a case in which

46

1

we have blurring, we have tarnishment, which is a near

2

subset of blurring, but the courts below looked at the

3

direct customer testimony.

4

Colonel Baker, the Judge Advocate -- Staff Judge

5

Advocate at Fort Knox -- looks at a Victor's Little Secret

6

ad in the base newspaper and writes off to Victoria's

7

Secret and says, they're using your name in an unfavorable

8

way.

9

His -- his deposition testimony remarks -QUESTION:

Well, he was concerned about the

10

tarnishment aspect, and I still have to -- I would like

11

you to comment on the -- on Justice Ginsburg's example,

12

too, would it diminish the capacity of the Victoria's

13

Secret mark to identify its line of goods if some --

14

somebody thought they also sold men's pajamas?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

Someone else, I think you

16

well -- you begin to have the elements of the proof of

17

dilution when you show that someone is using the same --

18

or a name which reaches mental association because of a

19

number of factors.

20

You might not yet have, as you have proof in this case, of

21

a really lessened capacity to identify and distinguish.

22

You have the elements of dilution.

Now, another -- the -- nobody sought to

23

introduce a survey in this case.

24

judges more than sociology graduate students to make this

25

kind of determination, and nobody sought to bring before

47

I would trust Federal

1

this Court a fact-bound determination of whether all of

2

the judges below were correct when they found that there

3

was a strong association, and beyond that, that the use of

4

the Victor's Little Secret mark to sell the kinds of goods

5

it sells, which some customers find unsavory, and which

6

Mr. Moseley himself testified some members of the public

7

find -- at least -- extremely offensive, that that has the

8

effect of lessening the capacity of a Victoria's Secret

9

mark to identify and distinguish those famous goods and --

10
11

and products, and that's -QUESTION:

But the blurring, then, that you're

12

describing now has no quality component to it?

13

comes when you get to the subset?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DELLINGER:

That only

That is correct.

Okay.
It -- it only affects the fact

17

that it doesn't -- no longer singularly stands for

18

anything, that if Rolls-Royce were on 100 different

19

products, it would no longer -- it would no longer mean

20

anything, and would no longer -- they might as well call

21

their car a Yugo if it's used on products hither and yon.

22

Tarnishment is a particular good example of why

23

the lessening itself needs to be remedied, because once

24

you've tarnished a product, it's hard to unring that bell

25

in the public's mind, if someone had a national program.

48

1

QUESTION:

Of course, if you're dealing with

2

Rolls-Royce, I suppose virtually any blurring is also

3

going to be tarnishment, which you don't necessarily have

4

even in other famous marks.

5

MR. DELLINGER:

Tarnishment has generally been

6

restricted so far in the case law to more unsavory

7

associations, sex, drugs, and matters of that kind.

8

is an act which is more limited than its critics suggest.

9

They -- of course, whether it was a bad policy was a

This

10

matter that should have been addressed to Congress, but it

11

can be limited to a few very famous marks.

12

A safe harbor is read broadly.

People can use

13

the term, Victoria's Secret, for any purpose they want in

14

parody and commentary, on the steps of the courthouse.

15

They just can't make this one use of it, that is a

16

commercial use in commerce that lessens the capacity of

17

that mark to carry out its function that Congress so

18

clearly had in mind when it passed the Federal Trademark

19

Dilution Act.

20

That's why I think the courts below saw this,

21

like Buick Aspirin and Kodak Shoes, as a core paradigm

22

example of precisely what the statute was designed to

23

prohibit, and why none of the --

24

QUESTION:

So, Mr. Dellinger --

25

MR. DELLINGER:

None of the most interesting

49

1

questions arise.
QUESTION:

2

-- is proof, then, submission?

If

3

you've got a very famous, distinctive mark, and you've got

4

a -- a very similar use.

5

then you get a few colonels to say yes, when they think of

6

the junior mark they think of the senior, is that enough

7

proof?
MR. DELLINGER:

8
9
10

You have those two things, and

It is in this case, Justice

Ginsburg, where the sufficiency of that I think was really
not challenged.
