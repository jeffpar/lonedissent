ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. CARPENTER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. CARPENTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In multistate power systems, each retail rake -Â­

12

ratemaking body has incentives to impose cost allocations

13

that benefit its residents, and the only way to assure

14

that the power pool recovers a hundred percent of its

15

generating costs is for a neutral body to referee disputes

16

among the States and to fix the allocations.

17

This case arises in the energy system where five

18

subsidiaries provide retail service in four different

19

States, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost

20

allocations generally can't affect its net revenues and

21

where FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy

22

authority to calculate the inter-company equalization

23

payments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the

24

sole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to

25

be unlawful.

Though we --

2

QUESTION:

What is -- what is the source of the

3

rule that this is the sole remedy?

4

MR. CARPENTER:

5

tariff itself, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6
7

The -- so the tariff itself provides

that.
MR. CARPENTER:

8
9

It's the sole remedy under the

Yes.

Under the tariff itself,

the only right that is reserved to the -- this is section

10

4.12, joint appendix 11a.

The only right that is reserved

11

to the operating companies is to seek amend -- if there's

12

a dispute over the rates, is to seek amendments in the

13

tariff or changes in the rate from the regulatory body

14

that has jurisdiction.
There's no question here that the LPSC doesn't

15
16

have jurisdiction to order amendments to the service

17

schedule or changes in the rates.

18

that they can disallow the costs that were incurred.
QUESTION:

19
20

Their claim is only

Is -- is the tariff provision meant

to preclude any sort of a judicial remedy?
MR. CARPENTER:

21

Yes, it would preclude a

22

judicial remedy.

It operates as a -- as a -- as,

23

obviously, a limitation on the operating companies'

24

remedies and as a forum selection clause in the event of a

25

dispute.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, there would be a judicial

2

remedy if they disagreed with the -- with -- with FERC's

3

determination.

4

the court.
MR. CARPENTER:

5
6

sorry.

9

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.

I'm

I -QUESTION:

7
8

They could -- they could appeal that to

They just couldn't go straight to the

court.
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

10

I -- I meant that they can't go -- they couldn't go

11

straight to court, and it means that -- for the same

12

reason that a State retail ratemaking body can't disallow

13

the costs because under -- under this rate schedule, the

14

rate calculated by the energy system is the filed rate and

15

binds everybody unless and until a complaint is filed with

16

FERC and FERC holds otherwise.

17

And in fact, the Louisiana commission here

18

brought a complaint for the period ending in August of

19

1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although

20

the tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and --

21

nonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate

22

equalization payments by including certain units that were

23

in extended reserve status because FERC found that those

24

units benefited Louisiana and the entire system.

25

QUESTION:

Can I ask?

The -- the section of

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- of the agreement that you -- you referred us to,

2

4.12.

3

unilaterally seek amendments or changes from any

4

regulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction

5

thereover.

It says each company reserves the right to

Why didn't they just say from FERC?

6

MR. CARPENTER:

7

QUESTION:

Well, at the time this --

I mean, if as you say it's only FERC,

8

why didn't they just say from FERC?

9

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, it was -- it was fairly

10

prescient because this -- this language I think dates from

11

1953, when there was the Federal Power Commission.

12

it --

13

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

14

MR. CARPENTER:

I see.

Yes.

But the -- the key thing here is

15

that it's undisputed that the LPSC can't amend the

16

service agreement.

17
18

QUESTION:

So,

Got you.

No.

I was just wondering

whether --

19

MR. CARPENTER:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- that was so clear to the parties

21

at the time, and you say it is and -- and what they --

22

what they were anticipating is a change in the Federal --

23

MR. CARPENTER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

-- body that had jurisdiction.
Right.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

2

MR. CARPENTER:

But -- but in the aftermath of

3

the FERC order that found that these charges were just and

4

reasonable, despite a finding of the tariff violation, the

5

Louisiana commission entered an order that said that

6

FERC's determination bound it only for the precise period

7

that FERC had addressed, and then entered an order that

8

prohibited the petitioner, Entergy Louisiana, ELI, from

9

recovering the same wholesale costs in retail rates for

10

the immediately succeeding period, beginning August 5th,

11

1977.
QUESTION:

12

Could -- could you explain one thing

13

to me?

14

simply that it was, with respect to that period, that

15

actual figures were introduced before FERC?

16
17

And that is, why was the period so defined?

MR. CARPENTER:

QUESTION:

19

MR. CARPENTER:

20

QUESTION:

22
23

That became the period because

that was the date of the FERC order.

18

21

Is it

The date of the -Yes.

And so, in effect, that -- FERC was

done with it at that -MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

That was the -- that was

the -- the theory --

QUESTION:

But -- but was there --

MR. CARPENTER:

-- of Louisiana Public Service

Commission.
QUESTION:

Was there any question in the terms

3

of the order that the order was intended to operate

4

prospectively until FERC changed it?

5

MR. CARPENTER:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9
10
11
12

Oh, no.

No question at all.

So the difference is unlike a filed

rate, which is a number, here is not a precise number.
MR. CARPENTER:

That's right.

Here the filed

rate is a formula that is -QUESTION:

And it -- and it's going to change

constantly.
MR. CARPENTER:

That's right.

It can change --

13

it can change I believe monthly, or the -- the rate

14

calculated under the formula can change monthly.

15

and FERC approves formula rates, you know, in

16

circumstances where it believes that it will better

17

promote the overall goals of -- of the act, and it imposes

18

terms and conditions that will assure that the overall

19

goals of the act are promoted.

20

And --

And here a critical term and condition was that

21

the determinations of the amount of the payments is

22

centralized at FERC and the only remedy, if there's a

23

disagreement, is to go to FERC and file a complaint.

24

point out, that's clear from the terms of the tariff, and

25

that's what FERC said in each of the orders in which it

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

As I

1

authorized the formula rates.

2

QUESTION:

But it -- from the point of view of

3

the public service commission, they have to approve the

4

local rates periodically, and how does the timing of the

5

thing work?

6

FERC and then there's a proceeding, and by that time the

7

year is over.

8
9

If the public service commission has to go to

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

But the -- if FERC were to

agree with the public service commission that we violated

10

the tariff, that the result was unjust and unreasonable

11

and a refund was appropriate, all the interests would be

12

protected because the -- they would order a refund at the

13

wholesale level with interest that the Louisiana Public

14

Service Commission could flow through to retail rate

15

papers -- rate payers.

16

QUESTION:

Well, wait, wait.

How would -- how

17

would the Louisiana Public Service Commission have

18

standing to come to FERC?

19

agreement, it says each company -- the companies who are

20

parties to the agreement -- reserves the right to

21

unilaterally seek amendments or changes.

22
23

MR. CARPENTER:
under the act itself.

24

QUESTION:

25

they can seek then.

I mean, to come back to the

Yes.

Well, they have standing

Section 305 I believe it is.

So this provision doesn't govern what

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CARPENTER:

No.

But -- but they -- but --

2

but what it does mean is that they cannot premise a -- a

3

prudence disallowance on the ground that -- that ELI could

4

have refused to pay the costs or -- or required that the

5

equalization payments be calculated on a different basis.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, sure, they can.

They could say

the company was at fault for not going to FERC.
MR. CARPENTER:
could say that.

Yes.

But -- but -- sure, they

It was imprudent not to go to FERC.

But

10

they can't speculate about what FERC would do in the event

11

a complaint was filed.

12

Louisiana Gas case of this Court.

13

theoretically possible they could say that it was

14

imprudent not to go to FERC, no remedy could be predicated

15

on that finding of imprudence because they can't speculate

16

about what FERC would do if a complaint were filed.

17
18

QUESTION:
intervenor?

That's clear from the Arkansas
So while it's

But can they go to FERC as an

I --

19

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CARPENTER:

22

QUESTION:

23

they should have complained --

-- I take it that was their status.
Absolutely, absolutely.

So they could go in and say, look,

24

MR. CARPENTER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and therefore you should do what

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

you would have done if they had complained.
MR. CARPENTER:

Absolutely.

They can do that.

3

And the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is

4

it -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate

5

interests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders

6

a refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by

7

the Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers.

8
9

Conversely, under their procedure in which they
can disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the

10

precise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the --

12

was designed to prevent.

15

You've got duplicative
Here in -- could be in five

And the effect can be a trapping of costs that

16

we never get back because if FERC -- you know, they --

they trap the costs pending the FERC order.

18

says -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and

19

reasonable.

20

the wholesale level.

21

trapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money

22

back under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking

23

unless an exception were somehow made to that rule.

24
25

FERC then

Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at

QUESTION:

In the meantime, our costs have been

Well, what is the function and

province of the State commission's prudence review?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

What -- what can they do that's proper?

2

can do a number of things that increase costs and

3

therefore change rates, or am I wrong about that?
MR. CARPENTER:

4

And I assume they

Well, what they -- what they can

5

do is they can regulate the -- the prudence of -- of

6

decisions that the -- the utility had to make.

7

circumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to

8

the -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in

9

the Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State

So in

10

commission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the

11

choice in one fashion or another.
But the point here is there was no choice.

12

The

13

equalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and

14

until it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC.

15

is a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and

16

under this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the --

17

the State commission was required to treat the resulting

18

expense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense

19

and pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until

20

FERC ordered otherwise.

So this

21

There's obviously a range of other issues that

22

aren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all,

23

as to which State utility commissions can examine the

24

reasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail

25

body.

But they can't say that -- that following your

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

duties under a FERC tariff is unjust and unreasonable.

2

That's a question for FERC.
QUESTION:

3

In -- in the course of that regular

4

examination that they -- that they do, can they find

5

certain actions that require refunds to the -- to the

utility to do.

QUESTION:

24

MR. CARPENTER:

25

In the context of the retail

Yes.
No, Your Honor.

That's an

issue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

before, if the rate is believed to be too high, under

2

the tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company

3

would have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain,

4

and the operating company has -- has no -- no right to

5

refuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an

6

allegation that the equalization formula was improperly

7

implied.

8
9

But as I -- as I just said, the filed rate
doctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and

10

even if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the

11

issue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the

12

practices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal

13

Power Act clearly allocates to FERC.

14

tariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from

15

doing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have

16

done, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted

17

the -- the State from addressing the issue.

So even if the

18

And the facts of this case sort of illustrate

19

why States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because

20

the decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the

21

parochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal

22

Power Act was designed to prevent.

23

the Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the

24

units in question, the out-of-state units in question,

2

irrelevant.

3

imprudence because the effect was to increase the costs

4

that ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and

5

that's a -- the kind of parochialism that the

6

Commerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was

7

designed to draw a bright line that would eliminate any

8

need to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct

9

violates the Federal --

10

But it said that was

In fact, it said that was evidence of

QUESTION:

Well, what's left of public service

11

commissions then, if -- if you're right, so far as

12

policing imprudent acquisitions and that sort of thing

13

for a multi -- multistate company?

14

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, they -- they can't

15

regulate issues involving, you know, the exchanges

16

of power within power pools, but there are a range

17

of other issues that, as I said in response to

18

Justice Kennedy's question, that the States can --

19

can decide.

Such as.

QUESTION:

Yes, just one of the expenses
And -- and so there's
What they can't

Am I -- am I correct in assuming,

9

as I have throughout the -- reading the briefs here,

10

that the -- the costs that a given operating company

11

incurs within its power pool is essentially the same

12

issue as the wholesale rate that a -- that a totally

13

independent company might pay when it -- when it bought

14

wholesale off the -- the grid?

15

seems to me in -- in each case, the operating company

16

is buying power at wholesale, whether it does it within

17

its group or whether it does it on an open market, and

18

that's what in each case FERC is regulating.

19

that fair?

Is -- is that a -- it

QUESTION:

Is -- is

Well -- well, FERC regulates the

And when one of those transactions

23

is the -- is the -- in effect, the acquisition of power by

24

a local operating company, that transaction is

25

economically, I guess, the equivalent of buying wholesale

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

by an independent company that is not part of a power

2

pool.

3

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, but FERC's jurisdiction

4

depends on the fact that -- jurisdiction depends on the

5

existence of wholesale sales which -- which exist in the

6

context of a power pool because each retail utility is

7

simultaneously, you know, providing power to the pool at

8

the set rate.

9

So it's --

QUESTION:

Oh, no, I understand that.

And --

10

and -- but FERC also has general authority over wholesale

11

interstate sales.

MR. CARPENTER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Absolutely, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So that -- so that in relation to

15

what a -- the reason I'm getting at it is, in relation to

16

what a State utilities commission can do, the State

17

utilities commission, I take it, is in the same position

18

vis-a-vis ELI that it would be if ELI were a totally

19

independent company buying wholesale off the grid.

that correct?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5
6

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Under Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light,

8

the regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in

9

interstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction

10

of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

11

jurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate

12

utilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to

13

carry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and

14

carry out those transactions without the interference of

15

potentially conflicting State regulation.

Federal

The facts of this case highlight the need for

17

exclusive Federal regulation.

The dispute in this case

18

involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the

19

common benefit of five utilities in four different States.

20

The Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated

21

to Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of

22

the Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to

23

reallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas,

24

Mississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely

25

unrecoverable.

MR. SCHLICK:

May not that ever happen to a

That's correct, Your Honor.

Under

this Court's decision in Nantahala, a charge that is

8

jurisdiction to approve may not be trapped and disallowed

9

10

You're -- you're not talking about

MR. SCHLICK:

13

You're just talking

That's right.

I'm -- I'm talking

14

about costs that contribute to the wholesale rate that --

15

that is within FERC's jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

16

So the -- the problem is that -- not

17

that the costs would be trapped, but that FERC has said

18

it's not trapped.

19

lots of utilities lose money because costs are trapped.
MR. SCHLICK:

20
21
22

That's -- that's the point.

That is -- I -- I think that --

that -QUESTION:

So the real point is here FERC has

23

said they can do it.

24

you're making, isn't it?

25

I mean,

That's -- that's the only point that

MR. SCHLICK:

There are two points.

There --

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there is the general prohibition on trapping, but also in

2

this case we have a FERC-approved rate schedule that

3

determines how the allocation should be carried out.

4

There's a question whether or not Entergy complied with

5

that rate schedule, but the resolution of that question

6

involves what the wholesale rate is or should be, and

7

that's a question within FERC's jurisdiction.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SCHLICK:

10

And that's a FERC question, period.
That's right.

Only FERC can

decide that question.
Unlike the cases on which respondent relies,

11
12

this case does not involve a State contract action about a

13

matter that is within the State's concurrent jurisdiction.

14

In the first place, there is no contract dispute between

15

the parties in this case, the Entergy operating companies

16

and the holding company.
Rather, this case arose in the same context as

17
18

Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light, a retail rate

19

setting.

20

among the operating companies in multiple states of costs

21

of operating the system.

22

23

the FERC can determine.

And the dispute involves the correct division

2

of the tariff, or you couldn't characterize the issue that

3

way?
MR. SCHLICK:

4

There -- there is a -- an

5

interpretation, an underlying question of interpretation,

6

of the tariff, but beyond that, there's the question of

7

whether the resulting charge was just and reasonable.

8

that's the important reasonableness question.

9

question that only FERC can decide.

And

That's the

MR. SCHLICK:

In the context of what the

may be what they're saying, but that's not what happened

in the case.

order refunds.

It held that the utility had invalidly

11

exercised its, quote/unquote, discretion to violate a

clear and ambiguous tariff for 10 years.
Then it said, we're going to have a new tariff.

We're going to curb the utilities' discretion.

MR. FONTHAM:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And having done so, and having set

the rate, how then is a State utilities commission, in

6

7

MR. FONTHAM:

Because the costs that were

8

incurred and are at issue here -- actually, I lost that

9

issue before the LPSC.

The LPSC, as to all the charges up

10

until August 1997, said since the FERC retroactively

11

effectively changed the filed rate -- I don't know how

12

they can do that, but they did -- they retroactively

13

approved a new filed rate.

it to be, because of the sentence of MPL that I read to

3

you, that if FERC says we have a piece of paper here that

4

either directly or through a formula makes clear that $5

of your cost, your total cost for the consumer, is correct

6

way to determine an interstate part of it, then when the

local commission looks at the $10 rate to the consumer, it

8

can do what it wants, but it has to take that $5 as a

9

given.

10

MR. FONTHAM:

11

QUESTION:

I've always understood

We did that.

Now, if the commission thinks that

12

the $5 that the company put on its line as part of the

13

interstate payment did not comply with every condition,

14

did not satisfy the law because it was unjust and

15

unreasonable, their remedy is to go to FERC and to say,

16

We're dealing with the

We're dealing with the overcharge, the

QUESTION:

The extra 5.

Now, I thought what we

were dealing with here was a formula set out by what I

used to call the FPC, which -- which formula said that

the 5 is made up of many things.

9

a charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company

10

in a different State to reflect the fact that that company

11

in the different State has generators in reserve capacity

12

that serve everybody, and among those generators are

13

generators that were put in mothballs provided that they

14

noted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that

15

this is a mothballed generator available for reserve

16

capacity if necessary.

One of those things is

All right, and if I understand it correctly and

17
18

I've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is

19

part of the 5, not part of the other 5.
MR. FONTHAM:

20

I'll give you that, Your Honor.

21

The -- but the -- but the problem and the difference is

No, but now we're repeating because

I -- I just said that if you think that the minutes were

25

of these five companies, that gave the instructions.

33

And

it wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you

3

The -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says.

4

they seems to me to be Entergy, but the Louisiana Public

5

Service Commission has only ELI before it.

6

MR. FONTHAM:

7

QUESTION:

You're making us pay too much.
So the

That's true, Your Honor.

So how can it say that ELI was at

8

fault for something that ELI is locked into by virtue of

9

being part of this multistate --

10

MR. FONTHAM:

What -- what the commission says

11

is that ELI is at fault in the sense of any utility, going

12

back to -- to Justice Souter's reference to two

13

independent companies in a wholesale power transaction.

14

Now, we all know you can go to court to enforce a

15

wholesale tariff, and that's where most people go.

And similarly, you want to say here that the

cost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the

QUESTION:

If you say you're arguing it violated

MR. FONTHAM:

No.

But -- but, Your Honor, let me --

10

let me take this and put it in -- in context here.

When a

11

State commission decides issues of intrastate ratemaking,

12

it decides all kinds of questions of Federal law.

to decide what the Internal Revenue Code requires.

14

to decide what the consolidated tax return provides for.

15

It has to decide SEC allocations that are filed with the

16

SEC.

It has

What does a FERC tariff require?

You apply Federal law, you apply State

It's the whole body of law that you're dealing with.
QUESTION:

addressed this question.
MR. FONTHAM:

No, Your Honor.

The FERC did not

address this question.

This is tariff 2.

Tariff 1 the

FERC did address and it said the utility violated the

tariff.
Now we're on tariff 2, and tariff 2 was

designed, according to the FERC, to curb the utility's

discretion.

will vary over time.

19

Louisiana commission is now saying is, the number that you

20

supplied was a number that violates those conditions.

You supply the number and you must supply the

21

MR. FONTHAM:

22

QUESTION:

Right.

And what the

That's true.

The fact remains that on the face of

23

it, FERC has said, if you come up with the number, that's

24

the tariff.

25

aren't you, in effect, challenging a FERC determination?

So if you are going to challenge that number,

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

And to do that, don't you have to go back to FERC and say,

2

they didn't follow your conditions, and therefore you,

3

FERC, should tell them that that number is, in fact, wrong

4

and they can't charge it?

5

MR. FONTHAM:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FONTHAM:

Your Honor --

What's wrong with that analysis?
-- I -- I don't think that's

8

correct.

I do think that your predicate is correct.

9

They -- they -- the FERC gave them a tariff.

That's the

10

tariff.

The utility's decision doesn't become the tariff.

11

It's like any contract case.

that doesn't -- my 10 doesn't become the tariff.

15

and -- and maybe this is where I'm going wrong.

In this case, I thought FERC did not say the

MR. FONTHAM:

18

Tell me

Yes.

It said -- what it said

was -- is, you go through this process, step 1, step 2,

step 3 --

QUESTION:

22

MR. FONTHAM:

23

25

Right.
-- step 4.

The utility did none

of that.
QUESTION:

No, but -- but at the end -- but what

FERC is saying is, if -- if you go through that process,

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the number you get at the end of the process is what our

2

tariff guarantees you to charge.

3

MR. FONTHAM:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, that's true.

And in this case, you're saying -- so

5

that -- so that the -- FERC is not saying what the number

6

is in advance.

It's setting the process in advance.

7

MR. FONTHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

Right.

And what you're saying is, sure, they

came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them

10

they could do, but they didn't go through the right

11

process to get it, and therefore the number's no good.

12

But in order to say the number is no good, you're still

13

challenging something which, at least on its face, has

14

been authorized by FERC.

15

appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and

16

say, the number they're claiming under your authority is

17

the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?

18

MR. FONTHAM:

And therefore, why isn't the

Okay.

I'll -- I'll answer the

19

last question first.

20

for the LPSC to take is not to go to FERC is because the

21

LPSC has the authority as part of its State ratemaking

22

authority, as part of State law to make --

QUESTION:

The reason the appropriate action

Yes, but that's the question here.

That's the question here.
MR. FONTHAM:

That's the question.

QUESTION:

Do they have it or is it preempted?

2

MR. FONTHAM:

3

QUESTION:

Well, it wasn't preempted --

And one question as to whether it's

4

preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the

5

Federal ratemaker and -- and, in fact, get the relief that

6

they want.

That's something we ought to consider.

MR. FONTHAM:

7

And, Your Honor, the -- our

8

position is -- and I believe it's correct -- that there's

9

nothing in the Federal Power Act that preempts the State

10

from doing this, that the only FERC jurisdiction to decide

11

enforcement issues didn't even -- they created it in 1980

12

approximately.

13

they found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to

14

United States District Court.

They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if

And there's nothing in the Federal Power Act.

15
16

In fact, the Senate had a provision in the Federal Power

17

Act that the FERC can award remedies for violations of its

18

orders.

It was pulled out.

QUESTION:

In other words, they --

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

You're talking about the

21

condition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever

22

FERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to

23

be filled in later, a State utility commission in a

24

ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line

number in its own bailiwick.

All that you're saying is that

10

Justice Souter was wrong to limit it to places where the

11

Federal tariff is open.

12

instances where the Federal tariff is specific.

13

you're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set

14

up an act where you have a single central Federal body to

15

provide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions

16

of kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State --

17

50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to

18

adjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in

19

fact, violated and what we will have is 51 separate

20

decisionmaking bodies to determine when a FERC tariff has

21

been violated.

22

It's just as applicable to

Now, I grant you Congress did not say in the

act, and we don't mean to do that.

QUESTION:

They -- they --

I've always thought that the Federal

rather wanted to have one centralized body that States

were free to use.

MR. FONTHAM:
