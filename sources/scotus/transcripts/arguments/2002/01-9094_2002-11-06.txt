CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

next in Number 01-9094, Abu-Ali Abdur' Rahman versus Ricky

5

Bell.
Mr. Liebman.

I think the Court would like to

7

hear argument on the questions we asked for supplemental

8

briefing on, as well as your original petition.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIEBMAN:

11
12

Okay.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question I'd like to take up first is why,

13
14

in our view, the unusual circumstances of this case

15

satisfy the two sets of demanding requirements that are on

16

the petitioner here to succeed:

17

this is not a successive petition, and 2) he then

18

additionally has to get over the high hurdle that 60(b)

19

imposes.

1) he has to show that

Let me, though, go first to the jurisdictional

20
21

questions that Your Honor referred to.

22

the court of appeals in three ways.

23

Mr. -- the petitioner here went into the district court

24

and he said, here's my 60(b) motion, I'd like to get 60(b)

25

relief.

3

This case was in

It was there because

1

The district court -- and this is on pages 42

2

through 44 of the record, of the joint appendix -- said

3

very, very clearly that it was going to make two rulings.

4

First it said, this is not a Rule 60(b) motion, it is

5

something else, it's a successive petition.

6

a successive petition, you cannot get 60(b) relief in this

7

court, and I'm going to refer or --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LIEBMAN:

Because it's

That's the district court judge?
Right.

What I -- but what that

10

did, Your Honor, was to establish a final disposition.

11

terminated all of the petitioner's rights under 60(b).

12

There were no rights left.
QUESTION:

13

It

He told the district court --

Couldn't he have moved to -- in the

14

Sixth Circuit -- to remand the case if he disagreed with

15

that?

16

MR. LIEBMAN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

He did.

He did, Your Honor.

Well, but that means that the

district court's decision was not final.
MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, it was final for purposes of

20

the 60(b), because the -- for purposes of the district

21

court's view there could be, would be, never could be any

22

60(b) relief.

23

QUESTION:

But it wasn't a final judgment in the

24

sense that an appeal could be sought from that, because it

25

was transferred.

The district court judge transferred it.

4

1

He didn't dismiss the 60(b) motion, which I would have

2

thought the district court might have done, and then it

3

perhaps could have been appealable.
MR. LIEBMAN:

4

Well, Your Honor, all of that's

5

right, and if the belts don't work, let's go to the

6

suspenders.

He -- the case was transferred to the court

7

of appeals.

The court of appeals, however, could not take

8

jurisdiction over the case unless the prerequisite for its

9

jurisdiction was established, and if you look at

10

2244(b)(3), which is in our appendix to our brief at

11

page 1a --

12

QUESTION:

Page 1a of the blue brief?

13

MR. LIEBMAN:

1a of the blue brief, it's very

14

clear under (b)(3)(A) that it has to be a second or

15

successive application before the court of appeals has any

16

jurisdiction to do anything with it, so its jurisdiction

17

turns on the question whether it was a successive petition

18

or not.

19

statute and would have to remand back to the district

20

court.

21

Villareal case.

If it wasn't one, it could not act under this

That's exactly what happened in the Martinez-

22

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what does the statute,

23

the AEDPA statute contemplate?

24

defendant's position could have applied to the court of

25

appeals for permission to file a successive petition?

That somebody in this

5

1

Could that have been done here?

2

MR. LIEBMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LIEBMAN:

Yes.

That was not done?
It was not done here because he

5

was saying all along this was not a successive petition,

6

if it was, he would not satisfy it.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LIEBMAN:

9

He --

Go ahead.
He was saying that he did satisfy

the requirements of 60(b), that the statute recognizes a

10

difference between certain --

11

QUESTION:

Well, then, to get an appeal on

12

that -- it sounds so complicated, because the law has

13

gotten so complicated with AEDPA, but maybe he should have

14

sought transfer back to the district court so the district

15

court could dismiss it and give something from which an

16

appeal could be taken.

17

MR. LIEBMAN:

Oh but, Your Honor, in Martinez-

18

Villareal, I think it's very clear this case is exactly

19

the same as Martinez-Villareal, which this Court ruled

20

expressly on the -- the first question it took up was the

21

jurisdictional question.

22

petitioner went to the district court, the district court

23

said, this is a successive petition, I'm transferring, you

24

can't be in this court.

25

What happened there is that the

He then took an appeal, and he went up on a

6

1

transfer saying, okay, you've got the transferred motion

2

in front of you.

3

The court of appeals actually dismissed the

4

appeal saying, we don't have that, but it decided in the

5

context of the transfer -- and this is very standard

6

procedure here now under AEDPA -- it decided, first

7

question first, do we have jurisdiction, and it said, you

8

know what, we figured out that we don't have jurisdiction

9

because this is not a successive petition, so we remand

10
11

back to the district court.
This Court then took cert on that question, and

12

the first question it asked was, do we have cert here

13

because of subsection (e) here, and it said, we do have

14

cert here because (e) is very clear.

15

of authorization can't come to the Court.

16

QUESTION:

The grant or denial

Well, let's go back to (3)(A) for a

17

minute, Mr. Liebman.

18

before a second or successive application permitted by

19

this section is filed in the district court.

20

of that is a prerequisite, I take it, for the court of

21

appeals acting, but supposing it's a second or successive

22

application that is not permitted by this section.

23

wouldn't deprive the court of appeals of the jurisdiction

24

to say no, would it?

25

It says -- as you point out --

MR. LIEBMAN:

Absolutely.

7

You say all

That

In fact, it has the

1

obligation, not just the jurisdiction, to decide whether

2

it is a successive petition, because if it isn't, it can't

3

decide the case, because then it's got to start with the

4

district --

5

QUESTION:

Well, but -- so then the first,

6

the -- the first clause of (3)(A) is not really, strictly

7

speaking, entirely jurisdictional.

8
9

MR. LIEBMAN:

Oh, well I -- I'm not actually

sure it's the first clause.

It says that the applicant

10

shall move in the appropriate court for an order

11

authorizing that.

12

the jurisdiction, but it's got to be for an order

13

authorizing what qualifies under the statute as a second

14

and successive application.

15

successive application.

16

Villareal --

17
18
19

That's what essentially gives the court

QUESTION:

This was not a second and

Therefore, as in Martinez-

Well, that's, of course, part of the

issue in the case.
MR. LIEBMAN:

Right, but that -- his position

20

was it was not, and therefore the court needed to dismiss

21

that case, and it had two options at that point.

22

either remand it back, which is the majority approach, or

23

it could simply have dismissed, and then he could have

24

gone back and filed in the district court again, which is

25

what a few courts do.

8

It could

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Liebman, initially in this case,

2

when the district judge transferred -- I think it got one

3

on the State's recommendation that that's how you handle

4

these cases.

5

say, please enter judgment against me under 60(b), I want

6

to make this -- test whether this is a 60(b) case or a

7

habeas case?

On behalf of the defendant, did anyone ever

MR. LIEBMAN:

8

That did not happen, Your Honor,

9

although petitioner understood the court's decision, if

10

you look on pages 41 and 42, to say this -- it expressly

11

says, you cannot file 60(b) here in this court because

12

it's automatically successive.

13

will never get any rights under 60(b).
QUESTION:

14
15

You cannot do it.

You

But he could have asked to test that.

He could have said, please don't transfer.
MR. LIEBMAN:

16

He could have, but in -- Your

17

Honor, in the Martinez-Villareal case, there was no such

18

question, no -- no -QUESTION:

19

-- see what Martinez-Real has to do

20

with it.

I may be missing it, but I thought that in -- in

21

this case, the reason that you cannot appeal from the

22

court of appeals order refusing to give you permission to

23

file a second habeas is because there's a statute that

24

says you can't come to this court when a court of appeals

25

refuses to give permission on second habeas, and none of

9

1

that was involved, to my knowledge, in Martinez-Real.

2

MR. LIEBMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Oh, yes --

That was a question about whether or

4

not there was a premature decision, or whatever it was,

5

and they sent -- the court of appeals sent it back for

6

adjudication on this issue.

7

MR. LIEBMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, Your Honor.

No, it's -- I'm not right?
The provision (e) here says that

10

the grant or denial of an authorization cannot come up to

11

the Court on cert, so the fact that the court there in -QUESTION:

12
13

You mean, Martinez-Real was a grant

of a petition for second or successive?

14

MR. LIEBMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

No.

It was --

Well, then, what has that statute to

do with it?
MR. LIEBMAN:

17

What it said was -- and this is

18

what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal quite clearly.

19

There's a threshold question.

20

do we have in front of us a second or successive petition.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LIEBMAN:

The threshold question is,

In Martinez-Real?
Yes.

Yes, yes, yes.

That was the

23

question there, because Martinez-Villareal filed a request

24

to --

25

QUESTION:

And what did the court of appeals say

10

1
2
3
4
5
6

was the answer?
MR. LIEBMAN:

It said, the answer is, this is

not a second or successive petition.
QUESTION:

Fine, so then the statute doesn't

apply, I guess -MR. LIEBMAN:

Oh -- but here the court said --

7

if I can be clear about this -- the court said two things,

8

and it said them actually in different orders.

9

order, it said, this is a successive petition, so now

January 18

10

we've got to go to the gateway question of whether you can

11

get into court.

12

actually almost a month later, February 11, it said, you

13

don't meet the gateway requirement.

14

And then a couple of weeks later,

QUESTION:

I -- I just don't see how you get

15

around the statute that says that you can't come here

16

after a court of appeals either grants or denies the

17

second or successive.

18

MR. LIEBMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Well, that's what I'm --

Which wasn't at issue, I take it, in

the other case.
MR. LIEBMAN:

That's what I'm trying to say.

22

The very first thing that our cert petition says in this

23

case is, we are not asking for cert from the question of

24

whether or not we meet the gateway requirement.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but you -- one doesn't really

11

1

ask for cert from -- from a question.

One asks for cert

2

to review an order, and the order of the court of appeals

3

is an order granting or denying.

4

MR. LIEBMAN:

This order had multiple parts,

5

Your Honor.

6

parts, and what he said was, we are asking for cert from

7

some parts of the order, segmented out and given

8

paragraphs.

9

of that decision.

10

It was actually divided up into multiple

We are not asking for cert from other parts

QUESTION:

But I think the question is whether

11

you can ask for cert for any -- from any -- part of it in

12

view of the provision of the statute that it's not -- I

13

just don't -- I'm not sure you can bifurcate the order and

14

say, we're not challenging the denial, we're challenging,

15

in effect, the reason for the denial.

16

MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, this was not a denial.

What

17

the statute says -- and I think that's really important --

18

is the grant -- I'm reading (e), as we go over from (1)(A)

19

to (2)(A).

20

court of appeals to file a second or successive

21

application shall not be appealable, but he was not

22

appealing the grant or denial.

23

preliminary question whether it even was, whether the

24

court even could have taken jurisdiction of that because

25

it had a second or successive --

The grant or denial of an authorization by a

He was appealing the

12

1

QUESTION:

That's not a judgment.

You -- you

2

appeal judgments, you appeal orders, you appeal

3

dispositions of the lower court.

You -- you don't appeal

4

statements or -- or expressions.

You -- you appeal

5

dispositions.

6

the -- of the application.

The only disposition here was the denial of

MR. LIEBMAN:

7

Well, Your Honor, then let me go

8

to the garter if the belts and suspenders haven't worked

9

here.

Petitioner filed a motion in the court of appeals

10

on his original appeal, and he said, in this appeal, what

11

we would like you to do is, rather than issuing the

12

mandate on the judgment that you issued before, which went

13

up on cert, we would like you to remand this case in order

14

for the court below to take up these issues, whether on

15

60(b) or in other ways, and the court denied that motion.

16

It didn't say why, but it denied that motion

17

without, expressly in regard to that, doing any kind of

18

gatewaying.

It just said, we deny it.

19

Now, it gives the reason in the earlier January

20

18 order that it thought that any post judgment motion in

21

one of these cases was automatically successive, and

22

that's our first question --

23

QUESTION:

All right, but --

24

MR. LIEBMAN:

25

QUESTION:

-- which is, that was a mistake --

-- on that -- now, this will get to

13

1

the merits, which I'm sure you'd like to get to --

2

MR. LIEBMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- but I thought that the argument

4

that what the court of appeals did was right is roughly

5

the following, that what your client should have done, or

6

the way it should have worked is that the district court

7

initially dismissed -- dismissed on the ground that there

8

was a procedural default -- his initial parts of the

9

initial petition, because, said the district court, he

10

didn't exhaust those, and he can't do it now because the

11

time is up, and your client never appealed that ruling

12

in -- the first time.

13

What he should have done is appealed it.

Then,

14

when he asked for cert and the Tennessee statement came

15

down, he would simply have amended his cert petition and

16

allowed us to GVR in light of our case in Tennessee, but

17

he couldn't do that, because he hadn't appealed that in

18

the first place, and therefore he had a final ruling, a

19

final judgment against him on that issue, and -- and

20

that's why -- that's why what the court of appeals did was

21

right, and that's also why it really is a second and

22

successive, because after all, you -- it's -- you want a

23

district judge to reopen a judgment where he made a

24

mistake but you didn't appeal it.

25

MR. LIEBMAN:

Your Honor, you're absolutely

14

1

right, the premise, which is that Rule 60(b) or related

2

motions in the court of appeals cannot be used to fill the

3

office of an appeal, but there's a very established

4

doctrine there.

5

Blackmon v. Money remand that this Court made, and the

6

question there is whether it was reasonably available to

7

him at that moment to make an appeal.

8

doesn't come into play, and that's perhaps the most

9

important question in this case.

It came up in the Muniz case, in the

If it was, 60(b)

As of the time Mr. Abdur' Rahman filed his

10
11

brief, his first brief, opening brief in the Tennessee --

12

I mean, in the Sixth Circuit on August 5, 1999, this

13

Court's O'Sullivan decision had come down two months

14

earlier.

15

establishing a discretionary review process that is

16

identical in terms.

17

gone through the terms in its brief and shown that they're

18

identical.

19

O'Sullivan read a rule of Illinois procedure

The State of Alabama has actually

This Court said, and I quote, without more,

20

those words are not sufficient to tell us that that

21

discretionary procedure is outside the ordinary post-

22

conviction review process in that State.

23

Tennessee at the time, there was that rule, identical to

24

the rule in O'Sullivan, and nothing more in the law.

25

fact, the State concedes in its brief that there was

15

In this State of

In

1

nothing in Tennessee law at the time besides the rule.
So it was not available to him at that point for

2
3

the very reason that if he had made that argument, it

4

would have been a frivolous argument because it would have

5

run foursquare into the precise holding of a decision of

6

this Court but two months before.

7

39 came down after the appeal was over, while the case was

8

on cert, that it said no, no, no, no, the law of Tennessee

9

has been since 1967 that our discretionary review

It was only when Rule

10

procedure in Rule 11 has never been part of the regular

11

and routine State post-conviction review process that we

12

have --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Liebman, we've decided a couple

14

of cases, one about 30 years ago, Harris against Nelson,

15

and then another case called Pitchess, in maybe -- that

16

indicate that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and

17

particularly 60(b), do not apply if they conflict at all

18

with the habeas regulations.

19

either -- either of those cases in your brief.

20

MR. LIEBMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LIEBMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LIEBMAN:

25

Now, you don't cite

Yes, we do.

I'm sorry.

We cite --

I --

We cite both of them on --

I didn't see them in the index.
Well, I believe that they are

cited in our -- well, I guess you're right.

16

I thought we

1

had cited them in the reply brief, but we make reference

2

to them where we point out, if I can find it here -- yes,

3

we do, Your Honor.

4

yellow brief, we cite Pitchess and Browder.
QUESTION:

5
6
7

On page 3 of our reply brief, the

You didn't cite them in your opening

brief.
MR. LIEBMAN:

We didn't.

The State raised them,

8

and we responded to them, and the point is that we

9

actually think that Martinez-Villareal and Slack stand on

10

top of Pitchess and Browder, so that they were obviously

11

decided in that same context, and so we cited the more

12

recent case, but in any event in our reply brief, what we

13

point out is, this Court has been very clear to say, is

14

there a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

15

and the habeas jurisprudence?

16

If so, the civil rule doesn't apply.

If not, it

17

does apply, and as almost all of the courts of appeals

18

have held, there are certain very limited circumstances

19

when a 60(b) motion does not interfere with the policies

20

of the habeas jurisprudence, and in those limited number

21

of cases, which includes this one, it is appropriate to

22

use 60(b).

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Second Circuit

was the only case that really supported you -MR. LIEBMAN:

Oh, no.

17

1

QUESTION:

-- in this area as to whether a 60(b)

2

rule can be used as a substitute.

3

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, Your Honor.

We don't at all

4

stand on the Second Circuit approach to this.

The

5

majority rule is that it is a case-by-case analysis.

6

It's -- for example -- the Dunlap case where Judge Posner

7

recently cited all of the lower court opinions, and what

8

he said was, the majority rule is that you have to look.

9

You have to say, is this the kind of 60(b) that avoids the

10

problems that successive petitions are -- cause that we

11

have a rule for?

12

not --

13

If they do, decide the 60(b) motion.

QUESTION:

If

How -- how long after the district

14

court ruled that your claims were not -- not exhausted,

15

how much time elapsed between then and the time you filed

16

your Rule 60 motion?

17

MR. LIEBMAN:

MR. LIEBMAN:

MR. LIEBMAN:

QUESTION:

23

MR. LIEBMAN:

We filed the Rule --

3-1/2 years, wasn't it?
But it was the key point --

Just answer my question.
Yes.

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor --

It was 3-1/2 years?
-- I think 3-1/2 years is the

24

right -- but the reason is that the trigger for the 60(b)

25

motion did not come down until June 2001.

18

1

QUESTION:

That's true, but the -- now I'm

2

thinking, when I read the Sixth Circuit's opinion again,

3

they're not really saying anything different.

4

they must mean -- I grant you it can be read either way,

5

but I can't believe that they mean every 60(b) motion no

6

matter what is second or successive.

7

I think

It seems to have arisen in cases where they had

8

good reason to think that the 60(b) motion in that case

9

was second or successive, as in your case they are looking

10

at the 60(b) motion as a substitute for a new petition for

11

the reason that it was dismissed the first time as a

12

procedural default, which is the end of this matter.

13

MR. LIEBMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Well --

And you didn't appeal it.

Rather,

15

for whatever set of reasons, you wait -- I mean, not

16

saying it was your fault, but you wait and go back and do

17

this other thing.

18

MR. LIEBMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, Your Honor, two points.

So is there -- is there really a

minority rule at all?

21

MR. LIEBMAN:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

Is there some court that really meant

23

it, that no matter what, 60(b) is always second or

24

successive?

25

MR. LIEBMAN:

That is the argument that the

19

1

State made here, and it's what the district court said,

2

and I can tell you the district court believed it, but it

3

doesn't matter here.

4

because we think that whatever the rule ought to be, this

5

is the kind of 60(b) motion that is not successive for two

6

reasons.

I don't want to get off on that,

First of all, it is -- it relies upon legal and

7
8

factual issues that are entirely within the four corners

9

of the original proceeding.

10

The law, the facts, the evidence, everything is the same.
Secondly, so that means you're not getting

11
12

out -QUESTION:

13
14

There's nothing new here.

Well, the law's new.

I mean, that's

your whole point.
MR. LIEBMAN:

15
16

Honor.

17

the way back in 1967.

Well, but it isn't new, Your

It was a declaration of the law as it existed all

18

QUESTION:

Well, all right, I'll --

19

MR. LIEBMAN:

But it's like the Fiore case, Your

20

Honor, where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said yes, we

21

came down with this interpretation of the State statute,

22

and it's true the lower courts had all seen it differently

23

up to that point, but we were telling you what the statute

24

meant all the way back, and this Court treated it as,

25

quote, old law.

20

1

QUESTION:

But then you said you didn't need to

2

put it in your -- make a cross-appeal of it because you

3

didn't think it was a tenable argument, so you can't -- I

4

don't -- I don't see how you could have it both ways, to

5

say it was the law all along, but we didn't have to say

6

that that was the law because O'Sullivan --

7

MR. LIEBMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, because --

-- hadn't come down, or had just come

down.
MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, Your Honor, what O'Sullivan

11

says is, if there is a clear statement of law by State

12

law, by rule or decision that says -- as the South

13

Carolina-Arizona provisions cited in this paragraph say --

14

that this particular discretionary review procedure,

15

quote, is not available, then the Supreme Court and

16

the Federal courts will respect it, but otherwise, if

17

we don't know what the law is, or it's not clear, then

18

we don't need to respect it, so that was --

19

QUESTION:

But the appellate -- the appellate

20

brief in this case, the brief in the Sixth Circuit, when

21

the -- when the prosecutor was appealing on the

22

ineffective assistance of counsel, that was filed before

23

O'Sullivan came down, wasn't it?

24

MR. LIEBMAN:

25

The State's brief was filed

before, petitioner's brief filed after.

21

1

QUESTION:

But the point at which you could have

2

filed a cross-appeal was before.

3

MR. LIEBMAN:

Oh, Your Honor, that's a very

4

important point.

In our certificate of probable cause to

5

appeal we asked the district judge, starting with point 1,

6

the prosecutorial misconduct claims and the procedural

7

default ruling on them is what we want to take up to the

8

court of appeals on our appeal, and the district court

9

granted a CPC -- a certificate of probable cause -- on

10

that ground, so that was in the case, it was in the

11

appeal, and it was specifically in the mind -- well, it

12

was on the paper that this was the issue that the cross-

13

appeal was going to be focused on.

14

QUESTION:

I thought you didn't appeal.

I

15

thought you did not appeal the first time -- we're back in

16

the year 2000, or early 2001.

17

MR. LIEBMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LIEBMAN:

20

QUESTION:

'99, actually.

'99?
Yes.

All right.

At that time I thought

21

you did not appeal the district court's ruling that you

22

had procedurally defaulted because you hadn't exhausted

23

claims X, Y, and Z, and the time had run.

24

MR. LIEBMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Well, all I would say --

Am I right about that?

22

1

MR. LIEBMAN:

You're right, but they were in the

2

certificate of probable cause, which is -- you have to get

3

that first, but of course the court of appeals doesn't

4

reach your certificate of probable cause.
QUESTION:

5
6

No, no, so I don't see how that helps

you.
MR. LIEBMAN:

7

Well, I'm just saying -- well, it

8

does help in this sense, Your Honor, I think, which is

9

that until O'Sullivan came down and removed the argument

10

that petitioner thought he had, he was planning to raise

11

it, but when O'Sullivan came down, after the CPC, but

12

before he actually got to file his brief, now suddenly

13

the claim that he wanted to raise looked frivolous,

14

because there was not a declaration of State law on the

15

point.
There came to be a declaration of State law, and

16
17

when it came sua sponte, it happened to say, because the

18

court in Tennessee believed that this to be -- was the

19

case -- that the law of Tennessee has always been since

20

1967 that this was never part of the post-conviction

21

review process, so -QUESTION:

22

Hasn't the Sixth Circuit had an

23

opinion on that subject as to whether the rule promulgated

24

by the Tennessee Supreme Court was a change, or was it

25

not?

23

1

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, it has not.

The issue is

2

percolating in the lower courts and in the Sixth Circuit,

3

but it has not ruled yet.

4

QUESTION:

But isn't the --

5

QUESTION:

The Sixth Circuit did -- the Sixth

6

Circuit had held before in a case arising out of Kentucky

7

that if you don't go to the top court, you have not

8

exhausted.

9
10

MR. LIEBMAN:

They said that in Kentucky based

upon a Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 1985.

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

MR. LIEBMAN:

After that point, there are five

13

or six decisions of the Sixth Circuit saying that failure

14

to exhaust that remedy is failure to exhaust.

15

similar decision in Tennessee at all in the court of

16

appeals before O'Sullivan came down, because the

17

understanding of practice there, and I know because I

18

practiced there at that time, was that this didn't need to

19

be exhausted.

20

QUESTION:

There is no

All right, so isn't the right way to

21

do this, if you were writing it from scratch, we have the

22

statute, you simply say, look, this is what second and

23

successives are for.

24

middle of the case, bring a second and successive.

25

the rare case where it should be allowed.

When the law changes just in the

24

That's

1

MR. LIEBMAN:

2

QUESTION:

I mean, I don't --

3

QUESTION:

But I mean what happened to you.

4

The law did not change.

Isn't that the case that they're there for?
MR. LIEBMAN:

5

This -- the second and successive

6

is designed to avoid every change in the law being the

7

basis for a habeas petition, but this is not a change in

8

the law.

9

argued that not only is this discretionary, so it should

It's exactly -- every petitioner literally

10

not be exhausted, but he also said the nature of this

11

discretionary process shouldn't be exhausted because it's

12

different from post-conviction.
QUESTION:

13

Well, may I ask you one more

14

question?

15

law, that would not have been a predicate for a second and

16

successive habeas, would it?

17

If it had merely been a change in Tennessee

MR. LIEBMAN:

Absolutely.

If it is a change

18

of law, it's preempted by the terms of the successive

19

statute which says, we've got a rule here for changes in

20

the law, but that's why this isn't successive, because

21

this is not a change in the law, it's within the four

22

corners --

23

QUESTION:

But doesn't that foreclose you,

24

because when you're -- if it's not second and successive

25

as defined by AEDPA, that means those are the only kind

25

1

you can bring?

2

MR. LIEBMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, Your Honor --

Not that you can pull something else

in under Rule 60.

5

MR. LIEBMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, Your Honor.

No -The State agrees if it's fraud,

8

if -- Martinez-Villareal, where you've got some State

9

court decision that changes everything --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LIEBMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well --- it's got to be --

-- are you suggesting there was fraud

here?
MR. LIEBMAN:

No, no, no, I'm saying, Your

15

Honor, that there are certain circumstances where

16

something that is literally second in time does not

17

qualify as a second or successive petition that triggers

18

2244, and so we need to know what that is, and the two

19

standards are when it is within the four corners of the

20

first petition and it completely undermines --

21

QUESTION:

22

for that statement?

23

Now, what's -- what's the authority

MR. LIEBMAN:

The authority is Martinez-

24

Villareal, Slack, and Calderon, and a huge body of lower

25

court law that establishes those very, very narrow

26

1

circumstances where it's so tied into the first petition

2

because it's the same facts, and it so undermines that

3

first judgment that there's no judgment left, that you

4

need something to substitute for it, but you don't have a

5

successive petition.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. SUMMERS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13
14

I take it

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This Court lacks jurisdiction of this case and

15

the writ should be dismissed, but if this Court concludes

16

that it does have jurisdiction, then the alleged 60(b)

17

motion was a prohibited second or successive application

18

because it attempted to revisit a prior final adjudication

19

based upon alleged error of fact or law.

20

Turning to the jurisdictional issue, the court

21

of appeals did not have jurisdiction to review the

22

transfer order.

23

It had no jurisdiction in the district court.

24

district court had no jurisdiction over the -- over the

25

motion because it considered it as what it was.

The transfer order was not a final order.

27

The

It was a

1

second or successive application.
QUESTION:

2

Doesn't the jurisdictional issue

3

really turn on whether or not it was a second or

4

successive?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

5

No, Your Honor, it does not.

6

Under the gatekeeping authority of 2244(b)(3) of AEDPA,

7

then the sold province as to determine whether or not a

8

second or successive application should be granted or

9

should be denied is in the province of the Sixth Circuit.
QUESTION:

10

But is it strictly in the province of

11

the Sixth Circuit to determine that what it has before it

12

is a request for something that should be called a second

13

or successive petition within the meaning of the statute?

14

If it is, they've got the final word, but whether it is is

15

a separate question.
GENERAL SUMMERS:

16

Your Honor, our position is

17

that you can't separate these two functions.

18

and under the clear enactment of Congress, when Congress

19

gave the court of appeals the exclusive and sole

20

jurisdiction as to whether or not a -- an application or

21

leave for application for a second or successive should be

22

granted or denied, it also gave them the exclusive

23

authority to determine whether it was -QUESTION:

24
25

words.

Under AEDPA,

Well, it didn't do so in so many

I mean, is your argument that if we split this

28

1

question into a) jurisdictional fact, b) the authority of

2

the court if the jurisdictional fact is present, if we

3

split those two questions that there's going to be

4

constant litigation over the jurisdictional fact, and

5

that's why we ought to read the statute your way, or is

6

there some point of text that is not occurring to me that

7

supports you?

8

GENERAL SUMMERS:

9

QUESTION:

Well, it's one or the other.

10

GENERAL SUMMERS:

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

13

GENERAL SUMMERS:

14

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Well --

Is it text or policy?
It's the first one, Your

Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

16

GENERAL SUMMERS:

If you were to split those two

17

decisions that the court of appeal has jurisdiction over,

18

then there would be a proliferation of appeal of that

19

first predicate decision.
QUESTION:

20

The decision, the first --

Well, is it going to be -- I mean, is

21

it going to be a difficult question in most cases?

22

mean, this is an extraordinary case.

23

jurisdictional fact question gets raised here, but you

24

know, in most cases is this going to be even a colorable

25

issue?

29

I

You can see how the

1

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Your Honor, I don't -- I would

2

not -- I don't think this is, frankly, an extraordinary

3

case to determine whether or not it was a second or

4

successive.

5

got the transfer order, they saw just what it was, and

6

that it was a second or successive application --

That is to say that when the Sixth Circuit

QUESTION:

7

Yes, you say that, but the relief

8

sought in the 60(b) motion was not relief from the State

9

court judgment.

It was relief from the final judgment in

10

the habeas proceeding because of the Tennessee rule, so

11

they asked to reopen the habeas proceeding, not to file a

12

second habeas proceeding, and they asked to reopen it, and

13

just to have a claim which was undecided in that

14

proceeding decided, which had never been decided, so there

15

was not asked for second consideration of a claim, just

16

for the first consideration.
GENERAL SUMMERS:

17

Yes, Your Honor.

What they

18

asked for was the relitigation of a claim that had been --

19

that -- that -QUESTION:

20
21
22

Not of a claim, a first litigation of

a claim.
GENERAL SUMMERS:

They -- they asked for -- they

23

asked for the relitigation of a prior final determination,

24

which we -- we submit and we -- our position is that this

25

was, in fact, a second --

30

1

QUESTION:

Did they ask in the 60(b) motion for

2

relief from the State court judgment which would be the

3

relief requested in the habeas proceeding?

4

GENERAL SUMMERS:

5

QUESTION:

They asked -- I'm sorry.

Did they ask for relief from the

6

State court judgment in the 60(b) motion, or just from the

7

habeas court judgment?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

8
9
10
11

They asked for relief from

the -- from the habeas judgment in the -- in the district
court -QUESTION:

So then it was a 60(b) motion,

12

because that's what 60(b) is directed at, where the second

13

or successive petition would have asked for relief from

14

the State court judgment.

15

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Well, they alleged that it was

16

a 60(b) motion, but when the district court received the

17

motion, the district court put substance over form and saw

18

clearly that it was a second or successive --

19

QUESTION:

Well, you call it that, but supposing

20

instead of the -- the Tennessee rule, they had been able

21

to demonstrate it -- very improbable, just to give the

22

hypothesis out -- that a waiver of the claim for the

23

prosecutorial misconduct had been executed and the waiver

24

was false, that there was a fraud on the court in -- in

25

having that issue precluded from review.

31

Would a 60(b)

1

motion have been permissible then?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

2

It would be the inherent

3

authority of the -- of the district court to take care of

4

a situation of fraud on the court.

5

QUESTION:

6

GENERAL SUMMERS:

7

Well, we don't think it would

even have to be a 60(b) motion.
QUESTION:

8
9

By granting a 60(b) motion?

Well, wouldn't that be the office of

a 60(b) motion, to correct that very fraud?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

10

Fraud on the court that would

11

impugn the very integrity of the prior final adjudication

12

would, in fact, be -- be -QUESTION:

13
14

Well, you go on a different section

of Rule 60, wouldn't you --

15

QUESTION:

16

GENERAL SUMMERS:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's correct.

-- the section of Rule 60 that

specially deals with fraud.

19

GENERAL SUMMERS:

20

QUESTION:

21

That's right.

But in that situation a 60(b) motion

would be permissible under that section?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

22
23

Yes.

If there was a fraud on the

court.

24

QUESTION:

Right.

25

GENERAL SUMMERS:

But that -- but the fraud on

32

1

the court would undermine the complete efficacies of the

2

proceedings, and that the final judgment wouldn't even be

3

final, because it would be a sham.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but you have to file a motion

5

and have those facts developed in order to do it, and

6

60(b) is the avenue for doing that.

7

GENERAL SUMMERS:

That -- I mean, that could be

8

a possible avenue, but that -- but that would only go as

9

to the fraud on the integrity --

10

QUESTION:

And here, the relief requested is

11

precisely the same, namely that one claim was not heard

12

which was in the case, for a reason that was -- turned out

13

to be a gross mistake of the law.

14

was exhaustion because of a rule of law, and it turns out

15

they were wrong, so you have -- instead of fraud, you have

16

a mistake of law.

17

They thought the law

Now, maybe that doesn't -- doesn't justify 60(b)

18

relief, but it certainly is a classic case of what 60(b)

19

is directed to -- to solve.

20

GENERAL SUMMERS:

21

QUESTION:

Well --

Directed at the final judgment in the

22

habeas proceeding as opposed to the final judgment in the

23

State proceeding.

24
25

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Of -- of course, Your Honor,

that argument would fly in the face of the finality

33

1

requirements of AEDPA, which only -- which only gives

2

us -- which only gives us limited circumstances to

3

relitigate -QUESTION:

4
5

But that's true of my fraud case,

too.
GENERAL SUMMERS:

6

Well, but in the fraud case,

7

Your Honor, the fraud on the court means that the original

8

judgment is a complete sham, is a complete sham, and there

9

was no --

10
11
12

QUESTION:
a mistake.

And here it isn't a sham, it was just

They misread the law.

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Well, they want it both ways,

13

if it please the Court.

They either say that it was a new

14

rule or an -- or an old rule that clarified Tennessee law.

15

If it was a new rule, then that would contravene 2244(b)

16

under AEDPA.

17

QUESTION:

But that --

18

QUESTION:

What is the right way to do it?

That

19

is, in your opinion, how -- suppose we had a -- we have a

20

defendant, a petitioner, a convicted person, and he has a

21

whole lot of claims, and there he is in Federal court and

22

he brought all of his claims up to the State supreme court

23

but for three, then he suddenly thinks, oh my God, I wish

24

I'd brought those up, too, and the district judge says,

25

well, you sure had to, so you lost them, because it's too

34

1

late now.

2

doesn't even appeal that part of the case.

3

Procedural default.

It seems obviously right,

But while the case is on appeal, this Court

4

says, he didn't have to go to the State supreme court with

5

those three claims if the State supreme court agrees, and

6

then State supreme court then does.

7

All right.

Now, there he is.

Under the law as

8

it is right now, he can make his three points.

He can

9

make his three claims, and yet as it was before, he

10

couldn't, and it's right on the case, it's still ongoing.

11

What's supposed to happen?

12

GENERAL SUMMERS:

13

QUESTION:

When the --

In your opinion is there just -- is

14

there no way a person could say, judge, please read the

15

supreme court and the Tennessee court, and you'll see that

16

your ruling was wrong, and believe me, that's right, so

17

what is he supposed to do?

18

GENERAL SUMMERS:

A prior final determination --

19

a prior final determination by the district court as to

20

the procedural default should be conclusive.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

So you're saying he's just out of

luck, nothing?
GENERAL SUMMERS:

Yes, sir, because --

because -QUESTION:

It seems terribly unfair --

35

1

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Well, but we -- yes, Your

2

Honor, but under the provisions of AEDPA there are two

3

circumstances where he could file a second or successive,

4

which we say is what he has, in fact, done here.

5

course, is if it's a new claim involving a constitutional

6

law that's made retroactive by this very Court, or newly-

7

discovered evidence to show factual innocence, but when

8

that court -- when that district court -- makes a final, a

9

prior final adjudication, then that is -- that should

10

be -- that should be final.

decision.

He should appeal that

He should appeal that decision --

He did not in this case.

You -- are you -- you're making the

18

general point that's not peculiar to AEDPA?

19

had procedurally defaulted, and that he, his claim was --

GENERAL SUMMERS:

that he was conclusively entitled to no habeas relief in

GENERAL SUMMERS:

QUESTION:

15

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Well --

-- which was 2 years later.
Well, his argument that

16

Tennessee adopted a rule that either is a new rule or an

17

old rule is not of much import as far as we're concerned,

18

because the Rule 39 that he relies upon changed nothing in

Tennessee law --

GENERAL SUMMERS:

22
23

Right.
-- so far as appellate

process.
QUESTION:

But they changed the understanding of

24

the district judge and the litigants.

25

law was otherwise.

40

They thought the

1

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Well, I think -- I think the

2

district court knew what the law was when he made that

3

decision, but certainly the Sixth Circuit knew what the

4

law was.

5
6

QUESTION:

You think he knew what the Tennessee

court was later going to decide?

7

GENERAL SUMMERS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, actually, the --

Because what he did is flatly

inconsistent with what the Tennessee court decided.
GENERAL SUMMERS:

What the Tennessee court later

11

decided, Your Honor, did not change Tennessee law so far

12

as discretionary review at all -- at all.

13

QUESTION:

But it did demonstrate, did it not,

14

that the district judge was wrong in his ruling on

15

exhaustion?

16
17
18

GENERAL SUMMERS:

The district judge was exactly

correct on his decision.
QUESTION:

That's the question.

That's the

19

ultimate question that I think this Court granted cert to

20

decide, but then we discovered that there are all these --

21

this procedural -- the question whether a Tennessee court

22

saying you don't have to exhaust does service for the

23

Federal courts.

24

it's an open question.

25

That is, the Federal courts could say

You have to exhaust the remedies that are

41

1

available to you.

2

didn't request review.

3

ah, you don't have to, because that's -- that ruling would

4

be made only for purposes of saying, let's get into the

5

Federal court.

6

You could have requested review.

You

We don't care if Tennessee says,

I take it that's your position.

GENERAL SUMMERS:

The decision as to the

7

availability of a remedy is a State decision.

8

decision as to what has been exhausted is a Federal

9

decision, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL SUMMERS:

The

Yes.
The Rule 39 that the

12

petitioner relies upon did not change discretionary review

13

in Tennessee one iota.

14

Rule of Appellate Procedure 11 says in its comment that

15

Rule 39 does not change TRAP -- as we call it, TRAP 11 --

16

whatsoever.

17

not appeal to the supreme court, as well as in June 28,

18

2001, an absolute available remedy under the normal

19

appellate processes in Tennessee.

20

As a matter of fact, the Tennessee

Discretionary review was in '95, when he did

QUESTION:

So on your view, the district court

21

was right when the district court said the first time

22

around, sorry, you didn't exhaust.

23

GENERAL SUMMERS:

Your Honor, our view is that

24

the district court was right in 1998 when he ruled that

25

the claims were procedurally defaulted, and if this

42

1

case -- if this case were to go back to the district court

2

today, he would rule that the claims had been

3

procedurally --

4

QUESTION:

Well, that -- we don't know that

5

because I think it's an open question whether -- after

6

O'Sullivan -- the position taken in O'Sullivan would apply

7

when the State court says you don't have to exhaust.

8
9

GENERAL SUMMERS:

But there's no question

that -- there is no question that in 1998, when the

10

district court found that the -- that the issues had been

11

procedurally defaulted, and that there had been no showing

12

of cause in prejudice, no miscarriage of justice, that

13

that was a conclusive final determination.

14

What this -- what this petitioner attempts to do

15

is to -- under the guise of a post-judgment pleading --

16

avoid or evade the second or successive restriction.

17

flies in the face of AEDPA, would be a mockery of the

18

finality requirements of AEDPA, and we would submit to the

19

Court that the transfer to the court of appeals was a

20

proper transfer, and that the court of appeals properly

21

determined the gatekeeping criteria was satisfied, the

22

writ should be dismissed or, in the alternative, the

23

decision of the court of appeals should be affirmed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ZIDLICKY

2

ON BEHALF OF AMICI CURIAE, STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL.

3
4

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to start by first responding to Justice

5
6

Stevens' question, in which he said that the Rule 60(b)

7

motion didn't seek the relief of granting of Federal

8

habeas.

9

the court -- the petitioner sought relief from the State

It actually did.

In the joint appendix in 170,

10

court judgment in bullet point -- I believe it's five, but

11

in any event, I think underlying that is the question of

12

whether there had been a prior -QUESTION:

13

You say the 60(b) motion was directed

14

at the State court judgment, is that what you're telling

15

me?

16

MR. ZIDLICKY:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Stevens.

And not at the habeas -- not asking

18

the habeas court to vacate the ruling on the -- on --

19

denying habeas and setting it down for a ruling on the --

20

on the prosecutorial misconduct?
MR. ZIDLICKY:

21

For both.

For both, Justice

22

Stevens.

He asked for both of those, and I think -- he

23

sought to reopen the judgment, and he also sought -- he

24

sought in bullet point 5 to -- or, relief from the State

25

court judgment, and that's in the joint appendix.

44

1

The question --

2

QUESTION:

But 60(b) just gets him the first

3

step, and if he succeeds in the first step, then he goes

4

further and says, okay, relieve me from the State court

5

judgment.

6

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Well, I was just responding just

7

to Justice Stevens' point that he didn't seek that relief

8

in his Rule 60(b) motion.

9

the underlying question is --

10

QUESTION:

He actually did, but the -- but

But he's doing it simply because he

11

is saying, I guess, that's where I'm trying to get to

12

ultimately.

13

MR. ZIDLICKY:

What he's trying to do is, he's

14

trying to relitigate a claim that had been adjudicated

15

against him through Rule 60(b), and this Court said in

16

Calderon that you can't -- that the requirements of

17

2244(b) can't be evaded, and one of those requirements is,

18

you can't relitigate a claim that has been adjudicated.

19

QUESTION:

Well, he's not relitigating a claim

20

that's been adjudicated, he's relitigating -- he wants to

21

litigate a claim that had not been adjudicated.

22

a ruling on the merits of his claim, which he never got.

23

MR. ZIDLICKY:

He wanted

No, Justice Stevens, there was an

24

adjudication of his claim.

There was an adjudication of

25

his claim by the district court which said his claim was

45

1

procedurally defaulted --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ZIDLICKY:

4

QUESTION:

Correct, but they didn't get a ruling

on the merits of the claim.

7

MR. ZIDLICKY:

8

QUESTION:

9

-- and that he had failed to

establish cause and prejudice, and that --

5
6

Yes.

No, he --

They just ruled that it was

procedurally defaulted because it had not been exhausted.
MR. ZIDLICKY:

10

Well, that's -- but I don't think

11

that's right, Justice Stevens.

12

Stewart and Slack, the Court made clear that in

13

determining whether there had been a prior -- the language

14

that the Court had used was whether there had been a prior

15

adjudication of the claim.

Here, there was a prior

16

adjudication of the claim.

This Court's precedent, going

17

back to Wainwright v. Sykes, Coleman v. Thompson, and -QUESTION:

18

In this Court's cases in

But the adjudication to which you

19

refer is a holding that it was procedurally defaulted

20

because the -- they had not been exhausted in the Supreme

21

Court of Tennessee.

Is that not correct?

22

MR. ZIDLICKY:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

And that amounts to an adjudication

24

on the merits, but in fact, the merits had never been

25

decided.

46

1

MR. ZIDLICKY:

No, it is -- it's an adjudication

2

for purposes of -- it's -- for purposes of determining

3

whether he can come back and file to relitigate the issue,

4

come back and -QUESTION:

5

Right, it's an adjudication that has

6

finality, which merits adjudications usually do, but it's

7

a finality adjudication that does not rest upon any

8

finding about the underlying merits of the claim that he

9

wanted to bring for relief.

10

MR. ZIDLICKY:

11

Court has adopted in -QUESTION:

12
13

Isn't that clear?

That's not the test that this

I'm not asking you whether it's --

I'm just asking you as a descriptive matter -MR. ZIDLICKY:

14

I don't -- you're right, Justice

15

Souter, he didn't make a determination regarding the

16

underlying merit of the constitutional claim, but -QUESTION:

17

Okay, and we use the term, I think --

18

correct me if I'm wrong, we use the term, merits

19

determination, to refer to a determination that is

20

binding, i.e., he can't do something back in the State

21

court and then come back and try again here.

22

a determination on the merits, but there are two kinds of

23

merits determinations.
One is a finding of default which cannot be

24
25

We call that

cured.

Second is a finding which may involve default, but

47

1

may involve a determination on the merits of the

2

underlying claim, and this is just a default kind of

3

merits, not an underlying claim kind of merits finality,

4

isn't that correct, just as a descriptive matter?
MR. ZIDLICKY:

5

I think it's correct as a

6

descriptive matter to -- but with one qualification.

7

you're saying is that there is an exception for -- I think

8

in substance what you're saying is, you can continue to

9

relitigate claims of procedural default because they're,

10

What

quote, not on the merits, but I think the way -QUESTION:

11

Well, maybe you can and maybe you

12

can't.

13

be allowed to relitigate, i.e., to litigate despite a

14

finality judgment, because of something very unusual that

15

happened as a result of the supreme court's rule change.

16

His argument here is, this is one that I ought to

What he's saying is, this is a special kind

17

of -- third kind of case in the middle, and you want to

18

treat this one for 60(b) purposes like a non-final

19

determination.

20

I think that's the argument.

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Justice Souter, and perhaps

21

this -- this is -- I don't think this is an exceptional

22

case in this regard.

23

QUESTION:

When he went back -Well, he may be wrong that it's an

24

exceptional case, but that's the argument that he's

25

making, isn't it?

48

1

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Well, the argument that he's

2

making is, he's entitled to relitigate a claim that has

3

been adjudicated against the -QUESTION:

4

No, he's not making that blanket

5

statement.

6

the finality which is claimed does not rest on a merits

7

determination, I ought to have a chance under 60(b).
MR. ZIDLICKY:

8
9

He's saying that in a case like this, in which

Well, I do think that this is --

this case is fundamentally different than the case in

10

Stewart and Slack.

In those cases, what the court had

11

determined was, it wasn't a second or successive habeas

12

petition.

13

reason was because you'd never received an adjudication of

14

the case at all.

15

claim.

You weren't seeking to relitigate, and the

The court didn't say no to your habeas

It said, not yet.
In Slack, the court said, go -- go exhaust.

16

In

17

Stewart, the court said, the case is not ripe.

18

the court -- here what the court -- the district court

19

told him was, they didn't say not yet, the court said no,

20

you're going to lose, and you're going to lose based on

21

precedent from this Court starting with Wainwright v.

22

Sykes.

23

Here what

Really what they're asking is for an -- a

24

loophole to this -- to the requirement for second and

25

successive petitions for procedurally defaulted cases, and

49

1

if that's the loophole, then there's no way to distinguish

2

that from abuse of -- abuse of the writ cases, because in

3

both instances, you can make the argument that there

4

wasn't any ruling on the substantive merits, but there was

5

a ruling, and the one that's important was, he received an

6

adjudication, and if he disagreed with that adjudication

7

he should have --

8
9

QUESTION:

Could you describe for me what

portion of Rule 60(b) is still operative with reference to

10

mistakes, given AEDPA?

11

Rule 60(b) with reference to the category of mistakes and,

12

if not, how would you characterize or describe for us what

13

remains of Rule 60(b)?

14

Does AEDPA completely supersede

MR. ZIDLICKY:

I think what -- the analysis that

15

the Court would have to determine is whether there had

16

been an adjudication.

17

the court has decided the issue, that there was a mistake

18

of fact or a mistake of law, the question is, are you

19

trying to relitigate the issue, and if that's the case

20

then 60(b) wouldn't apply.

21

If later on there's a claim, after

But if you're saying that there was never

22

adjudication in the first place for the example of a judge

23

who had been bribed in the first Federal habeas

24

proceedings, you would say, well, that's not a second or

25

successive habeas application --

50

1

QUESTION:

As to anything that's been

2

adjudicated, the category of mistakes is removed from Rule

3

60(b) when AEDPA is in the picture?
MR. ZIDLICKY:

4

I think if there's been an

5

adjudication, and I think that's the sense that -- in your

6

decision in Slack -- that's the underlying issue.
Now, it -- that doesn't mean that there's no

7
8

relief.

9

or successive habeas application, but this Court in Davis

10

versus Pitchess made clear that Rule 60(b) is not a way of

11

circumventing the requirements of AEDPA, and you in

12

Calderon made clear that what AEDPA prohibits is the

13

relitigation of a claim that had been adjudicated, and

14

that's exactly what we have in this case.

15

an adjudication.

16

You can -- you can try to seek to file a second

There had been

He claims that it was wrong.

QUESTION:

I think -- I think you're saying that

17

if there's an adjudication, there's no room for a 60(b)

18

motion predicated on a mistake.

19
20
21

MR. ZIDLICKY:

That is my submission.

think there was a mistake here.
QUESTION:

That's your submission?
I don't

I --

I understand, but that's your

22

submission.

In construing Rule 60(b), it simply does not

23

apply if there's been an adjudication, but my suggestion

24

to you is that the only time 60(b) applies is when you've

25

got a judgment you want to reopen.

51

1

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Well, Your Honor -- and the

2

reason that 60(b) -- you know, one of the arguments that

3

petitioner makes here is, they say that, well, these

4

claims will rarely be granted so you don't have to worry

5

about it, but the -- but what AEDPA requires is, it says

6

these claims are -- the -- if you're trying to relitigate

7

a second or successive habeas application, what it does

8

is, it takes that away from the district court completely,

9

the delay in the costs that are associated with that

10
11

relitigation.
QUESTION:

I agree with everything you say if

12

you are correct in classifying a particular judgment -- I

13

mean, a particular claim as a second or successive claim.

14

MR. ZIDLICKY:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Right.

There are some cases, I think, when

that classification does not fit the facts.
MR. ZIDLICKY:

But I think, though, a

18

determination of procedural default falls in the heartland

19

of habeas jurisprudence, and it's the heartland of a

20

determination that you're not entitled to relief.

21

Slack and in Stewart --

22

QUESTION:

In

So in your view, 60(b) necessarily

23

has a much more narrow application in AEDPA cases than in

24

other cases, or in habeas cases than in other cases?

25

MR. ZIDLICKY:

Yes, Justice -- Justice Kennedy,

52

1

I think that's right, and I think the reason why is

2

because, as this Court explained in Davis versus Pitchess,

3

you can't use 60(b) to circumvent the substantive

4

requirements of -QUESTION:

5

Well, what do they really intend in

6

Congress if, for example, the court comes up with an

7

interpretation of a statute that shows the defendant

8

didn't commit a crime, and there he is in habeas.

9

got a final ruling, denied.

He's

Lo and behold the Supreme

10

Court comes up with a case to say, you never committed a

11

crime.

12

successive because it says, constitutional ruling.

13

he supposed to do?

14

meant that there was no remedy at all?

15

He looks at AEDPA.

He can't find it's a second or

Nothing?

MR. ZIDLICKY:

What's

And do you think Congress

I think -- I think what Congress

16

did was, it -- it did identify the criteria that -- that a

17

district court would look to in determining -- it defined

18

that criteria, but the one -- the one place that you could

19

look to is, you could then go back to this Court's

20

original jurisdiction under 2241 for those exceptional

21

circumstances.

22

QUESTION:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Zidlicky.

there are a number of cases that are cited.

5

one of those cases is a 60(b) case in a habeas or 2255

6

situation where 60(b) was granted, relief was granted and

7

it was determined that this was not a second or successive

8

petition.

9

On those pages, in the footnote in the text
Every single

In each one of those cases, the reason was

10

mistake of law, the U.S. Supreme Court or some other court

11

came down with a new decision, and in every one of those

12

cases, that issue was not raised on direct appeal to the

13

court of appeals.

14

they had to adjudicate the question of whether it was

15

reasonable for them not to have raised it in the court of

16

appeals at that time, and in each case they did on the

17

ground that the new decision that came down changed

18

everything, and it suddenly made what looked like a

19

frivolous claim at that time into what was not a frivolous

20

claim, but, indeed, one on which there was at least a

21

right to adjudication on the merits.

22

It came back on a 60(b).

In each case

In some cases they won, in some they lost when

23

they went to the merits after they got their 60(b) relief,

24

but the fact is that those cases, including this Court's

25

GVR in Blackmon v. Money, which was a 60(b) case on a

54

1

successive, or a second, not a successive but a second

2

habeas petition, were cases where they had not been raised

3

on appeal, but they -- they were determined to be at least

4

potentially ones where there was a reasonable basis for

5

not having done it, and frivolousness, not making

6

frivolous claims is such a basis.

7

other cases has been particularly emphatic that habeas

8

petitioners should not -- especially in capital cases --

9

should not be raising frivolous claims.

This Court in Gomez and

10

The second thing I want to point to is that the

11

2244(b)(3)(E), which says that there is no -- it not only

12

says the Supreme Court can't take a cert petition, it says

13

that rehearing petitions can't be held in the court of

14

appeals, but the court of appeals are unanimous in saying,

15

if the question is whether this is a second or successive

16

petition, that can be reheard.

17

2244(b)(3)(E).

18

That's not governed by

We can separate that question out, and we can

19

decide that, and it's exactly the same thing here.

20

key case there is Mancuso in the Second Circuit, 166 F.3d

21

97, so the courts have been separating out those

22

questions, saying if it's a question of jurisdiction --
