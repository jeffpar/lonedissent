CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument next this morning in Case 17-1174,

5

Nieves versus Bartlett.

6

Mr. Borghesan.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARIO BORGHESAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. BORGHESAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case shows why retaliatory arrest

12

claims should be governed by the well-grounded

13

common-law rule that the existence of probable

14

cause would protect against liability for

15

enforcing the criminal law.

16

First, these -- the determining

17

causation in these claims is especially

18

difficult for the reasons the Court recognized

19

in Lozman.

20

filtering out speculative claims and giving

21

officers a margin for error don't work well in

22

these cases.

23

And, second, the law's tools for

And the Court doesn't want a rule

24

where an officer can be haled into court on any

25

routine arrest and forced to defend the purity

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

of his motives, however reasonable his actions.

2

Nor should the Court want a rule that gives

3

officers a reason to hesitate in situations

4

where they should be able to act decisively.

5

I want to start with the point about

6

complexity because I believe this case has all

7

the elements the Court identified in Lozman.

8

One, speech can be a valid consideration for

9

the officers in deciding whether to effectuate

10

an arrest.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

qualified immunity take care of that?

13

-- if, in fact, speech by its nature is

14

disruptive or otherwise interferes with the

15

actions of a police officer, that would give

16

them qualified immunity, whether there was

17

probable cause or not.

18

MR. BORGHESAN:

So why doesn't
If -- if

I don't believe that's

19

the way that qualified immunity works, because,

20

if the speech is protected, then the question

21

is, well, was it clearly established that you

22

couldn't retaliate against someone for their

23

protected speech.

24

rules in the Respondent's favor -­

25

And at -- if this Court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, no, my point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

is that one of your arguments has been that

2

almost all arrests involve speech, that in some

3

form or another, speech is implicated in the

4

incident of arrest.

5

But if it's truly integrated in this

6

-- in the incident of arrest, something like,

7

I'm going to blow up the President, that's

8

going to give you probable cause, but, more

9

importantly, it's going to give you qualified

10

immunity.

11
12

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, in the -- I

think in the -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Here, the problem

14

is that it wasn't implicated as a reason for

15

arrest.

16

and it came about after the arrest, meaning the

17

statement was made after the arrest.

It was a situation between the two,

18

MR. BORGHESAN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Well -­
So this is the

unusual case, not the normal case.
MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, I think the way

22

the Ninth Circuit applies qualified immunity, I

23

actually think this is correct, is if the -­

24

it's a question of fact as to whether the

25

officer actually was legitimately considering

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

the speech in deciding whether to arrest or

2

whether the officer was not and simply was

3

acting based on animus.

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Wright -­

MR. BORGHESAN:

So I don't think

except in the -­

8
9

If Police Officer

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if Police

Officer Wright wasn't present when Officer

10

Nieves had his interaction with -- with the

11

defendant, Respondent here, how could he have

12

been animated by animus?

13

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, all the other

14

speech that Mr. Bartlett was engaged in in the

15

interaction with Mr. -- with Officer Weight,

16

and the -- he was -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

sorry.

19

Weight.

20

Weight.

I'm

I keep thinking Wright, but it is

MR. BORGHESAN:

Yes, Officer Weight,

21

and he was challenging Officer Weight's

22

authority to do what he was doing.

23

protected conduct, but at the same time, when

24

paired with other conduct and the -- the sense

25

of danger that Officer Weight perceived -­

That is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

is, is animus on the part of what White -­

3
4
5

But the question

MR. BORGHESAN:

I'm sorry, Justice

Ginsburg?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question I

6

thought Justice Sotomayor was asking was what

7

is the -- what is the animus that -- with which

8

White is charged?

9

MR. BORGHESAN:

So there are two

10

theories of animus, and these were briefed in

11

the -- in the -- in the district court and at

12

the Ninth Circuit.

13

animus -- the alleged animus is that he was

14

essentially retaliating because he didn't like

15

Mr. Bartlett challenging his authority.

16

Officer Nieves, the -- the alleged retaliation

17

is that he was retaliating and he was motivated

18

because Mr. Bartlett didn't engage with his

19

questioning earlier.

20

For Officer Weight, the

For

So you have two separate theories of

21

retaliation.

22

You have a fast-paced situation.

23

to be an incredibly complex situation for the

24

jury to disentangle.

25

You have two different actors.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is going

Why is this any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

more complex than racial discrimination?

2

Meaning, in almost all situations involving

3

racial discrimination or allegations thereof,

4

it's complex.

5

not the exception.

6

Mixed motive cases are the norm,

So why should we treat this

7

differently?

We're now tiering things.

We're

8

tiering a right, the First Amendment, above -­

9

below racial discrimination.

I -- I don't

10

know, are you -- your rule would encompass

11

religious discrimination, and so that's now

12

less important than racial discrimination.

13

Should we be creating exceptions to

14

the clear statutory command that any person who

15

violates a constitutional right should be held

16

responsible?

17

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, to answer your

18

-- your last point first, Justice Sotomayor,

19

Section 1983 created -- created an action at

20

law for violation of federal rights.

21

actions of law are subject to defenses and

22

immunities, and the elements of these actions

23

have claims, and all of these -- to prevent

24

recovery even in some instances where we think

25

that there would be -- there might have been an

And

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

actual violation of a constitutional right.

2

And the same is true with arrests.

At

3

common law, if an officer had lawful authority

4

to make the arrest, then that was end of story

5

and the arrest was privileged.

6

And that's the -- that's the principle

7

that Congress didn't silently abrogate when it

8

enacted Section 1983.

9

well for these cases because they're a subset

And that rule also works

10

of First Amendment claims that involve an

11

arrest.

12

Same as -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

So this -- this is a

13

difficult issue, which we've heard a couple of

14

times now already, because there are a range of

15

cases.

16

case that's sort of like this case, where

17

you've got the disorderly person situation.

18

police officer arrives at the scene where two

19

people or a -- two groups of people are

20

shouting at each other, and in the course of

21

the -- while the officer is present, one of

22

them says something insulting to the officer,

23

and that person ends up getting arrested.

24
25

And at one end, I think, there is a

And so you have the question of
whether that's -- that has to go -- that may

Heritage Reporting Corporation

A

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

have to go to trial as to the -- the officer's

2

motivation, was it because the kind of fuzzy

3

standard of disorderly conduct was met or was

4

it because the person -- what the person said

5

about the officer.

6

maybe at one end.

7

So you've got that category

At the other end, you have the case

8

like a journalist has written something

9

critical of the police department and then a

10

couple of days later or a week later, two day

11

-- two weeks later, whatever, some period of

12

time, is arrested -- is given a citation for

13

driving 30 miles an hour in a 20-mile -­

14

25-mile-an-hour zone.

15

So your rule -- what you ask us to do

16

would create a problem in the latter situation.

17

What the other side asks us to do may create a

18

problem in the disorderly person situation.

19

do you have any way of solving this, other than

20

asking us to decide which -- which rule -­

21

which of these unattractive rules we should

22

adopt?

23

MR. BORGHESAN:

So

Well, I think the

24

probable cause element actually does a good job

25

of capturing the subset of these claims when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

there actually is a First Amendment violation.

2

And you have two -- two of the cases we cite in

3

our brief survive summary judgment.

4

probable cause for the arrest.

5

to a jury.

6

journalists.

7

returned a verdict for the defendants.

8

There was

And they went

These were cases involving
And in both those cases, the jury

And so I think probable cause actually

9

does sort well these -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but I think

11

what Justice Alito is suggesting is that in the

12

second category of cases -- and you can think

13

of it as the journalist case or you can think

14

of it as a case where an individual police

15

officer, you know, decides to arrest for

16

jaywalking somebody wearing a Black Lives

17

Matter T-shirt or, alternatively, a Make

18

America Great Again cap or something like that,

19

you know, that -- that -- that there might be

20

probable cause.

21

jaywalked.

The person jaywalked.

He

22

And the point is that there are so

23

many laws that people can break that police

24

officers generally look the other way, but, you

25

know, you're saying something that the officer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

doesn't much like, so he doesn't look the other

2

way.

3

MR. BORGHESAN:

I think -- so, with

4

the jaywalking cases, and I'd start by pointing

5

out that at least in Alaska and probably the

6

vast majority of states you can't arrest

7

someone for jaywalking.

8

they would likely be disciplined.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if someone did,

You know, they're

10

driving and they have a bumper sticker that the

11

police officer doesn't like and he pulls them

12

over when he wouldn't otherwise pull them over

13

because the person had failed to signal a turn.

14

MR. BORGHESAN:

And if you look

15

through the cases that are cited by the parties

16

in amici, the case of I pulled someone over and

17

they had a Hillary 2016 bumper sticker and

18

that's the alleged basis for the retaliation,

19

you don't see them.

20

rare.

21

Those cases are incredibly

And the Court in Hartman decided that

22

it wasn't going to design the rule for the

23

vanishingly rare case.

24

the rule for the typical case.

25

It was going to design

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, we saw the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

case -­

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me clarify two

things about your position.

4

Would you -- we have Lozman on one

5

side.

Would you say Lozman apart, no

6

retaliatory arrest claim unless the plaintiff

7

shows the absence of probable cause?

8

say that across the board for retaliatory

9

arrest claims, save only the Lozman category?

10
11

MR. BORGHESAN:

Would you

That is our position,

Justice Ginsburg.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

thing about your position.

14

cause, probable cause for the charged offenses

15

or probable cause for some offense that wasn't

16

charged?

17

MR. BORGHESAN:

And then one other
On the probable

I think, in that

18

respect, the Court's rule should recognize that

19

police officers arrest based on the course of

20

conduct and they aren't legal technicians.

21

So I think that, at a minimum, the

22

Court's rule should -- the probable cause

23

element should apply for the stated crime of

24

arrest or the crimes charged or crimes closely

25

related to those crimes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

And whether it has to go further to

2

address a situation like the Court was dealing

3

with in Lozman, I don't think this case

4

presents that question.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think of

6

efforts to reach a compromise between the two

7

cases that Justice Alito raised?

8

in Lozman a case where, I think in the

9

courtroom, someone said, well, surely there's

10

See, we saw

some statute he violated.

11

Now that doesn't sound like a good

12

case for your side.

13

I've written down, we have, one, Mt. Healthy,

14

plaintiff, he engaged in protected expression.

15

That won't be too hard to show.

16

So, among other things

The defendant harbored retaliatory

17

animus.

In a lot of these cases, he did, for

18

political or racial maybe or other reasons.

19

Three, animus was a substantial factor

20

motivating the decision.

That's a little

21

tougher to show where there's probable cause.

22

And then, even in the absence of the probable

23

cause, even in the absence of protected

24

conduct, he would have reached the same

25

decision.

That's beside the point.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

Suppose we added to that and we took

2

what Justice Rehnquist said in Crawford-El,

3

that if you get to the stage where you get

4

through one, two, and maybe three, and there is

5

probable cause for something, the plaintiff has

6

to show with some objective evidence that the

7

arrest was a pretext for retaliation.

8

one way of doing it.

9

Rehnquist's way.

10

That's

That's Justice

A second way is that you have to know

11

that -- you at least have to know the arresting

12

policeman, but there is a statute that forbids

13

what he did, you can't find it out later, or no

14

reasonable person would have arrested or no

15

reasonable policeman without the animus would

16

have arrested this person for this thing in the

17

moment.

18

bad motive, the policeman.

19

That's after you prove that he had a

Now there might be others.

But what

20

I'm looking for, looking to what Chief Justice

21

Rehnquist said, and others that come at the

22

spur of the moment, is some way of guarding

23

against the danger that Justice Alito said in

24

his second example, without destroying and

25

raising the huge problem that lay in his first

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

example.

2

So I give you three that I don't -­

3

I'm not buying the three I gave.

4

to set you on a track thinking of that.

5

MR. BORGHESAN:

I just want

Well, I think some of

6

those rules or suggestions that you gave,

7

Justice Breyer, I think would be very difficult

8

for courts to administer.

9

no reasonable police officer would arrest.

As, for example, the

10

Let's say now no reasonable police officer in

11

Washington, D.C., no reasonable police officer

12

in a specific neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

13

Facts of arrests are incredibly

14

varied.

15

think that's going to be a very difficult

16

analysis for courts to -- for courts to engage

17

in.

18

Do the minor details matter?

And I

And it's not a -- it's not a clear

19

bright-line rule.

So, in Crawford -- I'm

20

sorry, not in Crawford-El -- in Armstrong, for

21

cases of selective enforcement, the Court left

22

open the possibility in a footnote that, if

23

there were a direct admission of -- of

24

discriminatory animus, then the plaintiff would

25

not necessarily have to show that there was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

similarly-situated people being treated

2

differently, which is the normal thing that a

3

plaintiff has to show for those types of

4

claims.

5

I think the Court could do something

6

similar.

I think the problem with that is what

7

the Court recognized in Hartman, is that the

8

exception becomes, again, difficult to

9

administer.

What's a direct admission?

And

10

how does the court -- how does a court draw

11

that line?

12

a variety of cases.

13

And that's going to be litigated in

I mean, I think the court obviously

14

has carved out exceptions in the past, and most

15

recently in Lozman, but I think those

16

exceptions can be problematic.

17

best rule, again, is the clear bright line of,

18

if there was probable cause for the arrest,

19

then there's no liability for a retaliatory

20

arrest claim.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And I think the

You -- you base

22

that in part on the practical and policy

23

concerns that you started with, that you raise,

24

and Justice Alito also points out, but the

25

Ninth Circuit has had experience for a number

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

of years with a rule that has allowed suits

2

like this to proceed, and, at least based on

3

the briefing, it doesn't show any massive

4

problem, or correct me if I'm wrong about that.

5

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, I think -- I

6

think the data is a little bit noisy because,

7

until recently, you had qualified immunity that

8

would bar a lot of these claims.

9

if the Court rules in the Respondent's favor,

And I think,

10

as the consciousness of that rule trickles

11

down, you'll have more and more retaliatory

12

arrest claims being stated.

13

And I also think it's not just the -­

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, why wouldn't

15

-- explain to me on the qualified immunity -­

16

Justice Sotomayor had raised that too -- why -­

17

why doesn't that solve the issue?

18

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, I think

19

qualified immunity works in the subset of cases

20

-- and I think it's a narrow subset -- where

21

it's not clearly established that the person's

22

speech was protected, but in the -- I think

23

that's going to be a subset of cases.

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

25

Right.

But the

bottom line point is the Ninth Circuit, it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

been a number of years now, has had the rule

2

contrary, and -­

3

MR. BORGHESAN:

It's at least -­

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- I would have

5

expected, if there were the problems that you

6

articulate, and I understand why you articulate

7

them, and maybe they will come about as a

8

result of a decision from this Court in more

9

numbers, but there hasn't been a huge problem.

10

MR. BORGHESAN:

Well, I think they

11

will.

12

clearly established in the Ninth Circuit in

13

2013, a lot of the decisions you have coming

14

out involve conduct from before then.

15

And, you know, the rule was established,

And so that's why I think you haven't

16

seen maybe the -- the rise in the number of

17

cases that I think a ruling in the Respondent's

18

favor will require.

19

And it's not just the -- the total

20

quantity of claims.

It's also the fact that

21

the Court's ruling on this issue has a

22

potential to affect how police officers conduct

23

themselves in the field.

24

And if there are no questions -­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

7

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. WALL:

10

it please the Court:

11

Two points.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

First, every similar

12

constitutional tort claim under 1983 has an

13

objective requirement that prevents a purely

14

subjective inquiry into officers' motivations.

15

If anything, it is more important that

16

claims of retaliatory arrest be subject to such

17

a screen because, as the bipartisan states'

18

brief from D.C. points out, they're easy to

19

allege and difficult and expensive to defend

20

against.

21

Second, of the -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Wall, I

23

mean, in the Fourth Amendment context, for

24

example, the fact that there's a probable cause

25

requirement is a function of the substance of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

the Fourth Amendment.

2

this case is that you're asking for a probable

3

cause requirement that bears no relationship to

4

the actual First Amendment violation.

5

What's unusual about

In other words, it makes no difference

6

to the First Amendment that there might have

7

been probable cause for an arrest if, in fact,

8

the arrest occurred as a result of retaliation

9

for protected speech.

10

MR. WALL:

So the plaintiff made

11

exactly the same argument to this Court in

12

Hartman, Justice Kagan, and the Court rejected

13

it, I think for the reason that although, of

14

course, what you're trying to get at is, was

15

the officer's motivation the speech or the

16

unlawful conduct, the probable cause evidence

17

is the best way to get at that across the range

18

of cases.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, as I read

20

Hartman, Hartman was very dependent on two

21

factors, neither of which is here.

22

is that the prosecutor is absolutely immune, so

23

that you were dealing with upstream actors, and

24

the causation was very difficult.

25

second was that there was a presumption of

The first

And the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

regularity that attached to prosecutorial

2

action.

3

And the combination of both those

4

things meant that the Court said, you know

5

what, in the usual case or in the -- you know,

6

in the more than usual case, in the almost

7

always case, the prosecutor's action has

8

cleansed whatever retaliatory -- retaliatory

9

motive you can find further upstream.

10
11
12

And, here, neither one of those two
things is true.
MR. WALL:

So let me take them in

13

turn, and I -- I think it -- it -- that isn't

14

sort of fair to the other parts of Hartman

15

because it did rely on other things that I

16

think do apply equally here.

17

But just for those two, yes, the fact

18

that you had multiple actors in Hartman and one

19

of them was absolutely immune did make the

20

causal inquiry difficult, but I don't think

21

that we should understand Hartman as just a

22

case about prosecutors.

23

Justice Souter's opinion, although that was the

24

reason why the causal inquiry was difficult,

25

what he's focused on is the factual difficulty

I think reading

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

of causation, and he says the body of probable

2

cause evidence is the best way to get at that

3

across the range of cases.

4

And although we don't have the same

5

presumption of regularity for officers that we

6

do for -- for prosecutors, we do have an even

7

more iron-clad rule under the Fourth Amendment,

8

which is that every arrest is per se reasonable

9

for purposes of the Fourth Amendment where you

10
11

have probable cause.
And so in the same way that you have

12

-- the presumption of regularity gives you some

13

reason with prosecutors to think it wasn't

14

induced by the animus, I think the Moore rule

15

gives you the same rule.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. WALL:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. WALL:

Well -­

Where you have an arrest -­
Go ahead.

-- that's supported by

20

probable cause, I think that's a very good

21

reason to think that's why the officer was

22

doing what he was doing.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

What if we

24

try to sort of bell the cat here by -- by, at

25

the moment, we've got speech and we have some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

animus against speech and we have a rule that

2

says:

3

That's it -- that's what you want -- that's it.

4

Good-bye, plaintiff.

Officer, you have probable cause.

5

Now suppose we weaken that and simply

6

say where there's probable cause, yes, that's

7

it, unless there is objective evidence that it

8

was a pretext.

9

judge six years later trying -- going through

For example, when you have the

10

the statute books to try to find a statute that

11

fit within probable cause for the arrest, that

12

sounds pretty much like objective evidence of a

13

pretext.

14

something that was never -- nobody's ever been

15

arrested before for that, in this circumstance,

16

sounds like a pretext.

17

Where the officer arrests him for

And so why not do that?

That's a

18

compromise.

19

First Amendment, without avoiding the most

20

horrible mess that you're afraid of, and it's

21

been suggested before.

22

It gives some protection to the

MR. WALL:

So why not?

So those are two very

23

different things, Justice Breyer.

24

may be real.

25

paper tiger.

The second

I think the first is a -- is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

On the first, if the Court sets it up

2

to say, look, probable cause is important

3

evidentiarily to the officer's motive unless

4

you have some evidence of pretext for all the

5

rest, that's essentially -­

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Objective evidence

that it was a pretext.

8

MR. WALL:

That's right, but if a case

9

like this one, if facts like these get you to

10

the jury, right, you come in with a statement

11

and you say the officer indicated, because of

12

his statement, which isn't captured on video,

13

but you just allege it and you have to take it

14

as true, if that gets you to a jury, I don't

15

think that's actually going to do anything.

16

But the second -- the second thing you

17

point to was different, right?

That's the

18

Devenpeck rule.

19

the Court at Lozman was -- was interested about

20

last time, when do you have to identify the

21

offenses?

22

thereafter, or leading up to some criminal

23

proceeding?

That's the question of, which

At the time of the arrest, shortly

24

Now, you know, for the reasons in our

25

brief, we'd urge the Court to adopt Devenpeck,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

but I do think if the Court drew in that rule

2

further away from the trial or limited it at

3

the outset of a civil proceeding, I think that

4

would be a meaningful limitation.

5

I just think that -- that the first

6

one that you -- you sketched out where it's

7

sort of the weighing of the evidence, I think,

8

if you look through the cases, that's going to

9

allow all these things to go to the jury.

10

And that was the one thing I wanted to

11

say to you, Justice Alito, which is, look, I

12

think we have by far the best reading of the

13

common law in Hartman, but even if the Court

14

disagrees with us doctrinally, if you look at

15

the cases, you just do a simple Westlaw search

16

for retaliatory arrest, hundreds and hundreds,

17

about 250 in the Ninth Circuit alone, just

18

post-Reichle, just in the last five years, the

19

number of those that have credible allegations

20

of your second scenario, very few.

21

one of those has gone to a fact-finder.

22

23

retaliatory animus that drove the -­

But that's the

point, isn't it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Whenever there's -­

2

whenever there's probable cause and there's a

3

First Amendment allegation, what's really being

4

complained about is discriminatory arrest.

5

what if we were to say that a party making such

6

a claim has to plead and ultimately prove that

7

there is a comparator who engaged in similar

8

conduct or people who were similar and they

9

engaged in the same conduct, but they were not

10
11

So

arrested?
MR. WALL:

So I -- I don't -- so the

12

common law didn't have a rule, and the Court in

13

Hartman didn't look there.

14

it's going to be a problem is that you might be

15

able to run the analysis in the riot and the

16

protest cases, though those are a fairly small

17

fraction of the cases, but in virtually all of

18

them there's not going to be a comparator.

19
20
21

I think the reason

I mean, I'd encourage the Court to
look at the video here, both of them, before -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Well, if

22

there's no comparator, then the plaintiff is

23

out of luck.

24
25

MR. WALL:

That's right, but I don't

think that really is going to track the cases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

that the Court's worried about on anybody's

2

view.

3

view because you can have an arrest that isn't

4

supported by probable cause that seems fairly

5

obviously retaliatory, and there are some of

6

those that go forward in lower cases -- lower

7

courts and the plaintiffs prevail.

8

won't be able to show a comparator because it

was a one-on-one interaction with the officer.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can we go back to what

15

you said about Devenpeck, Mr. Wall?

16

I'm just not sure I understood it.

17

MR. WALL:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because

Right.
You said you think

19

that the government has the right view, which

20

is that the Devenpeck rule should apply here,

21

but -- there was a "but" at the end of the

22

sentence.

23

MR. WALL:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Yes.
And what was the

"but"?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

MR. WALL:

I think the "but" is that

2

if the Court wants to draw limits on these to

3

try to get at cases where the officers or the

4

prosecutors are just kind of inventing probable

5

cause after the fact to paper over an arrest

6

that was problematic, you could limit the

7

probable cause inquiry to the -- some

8

reasonable time frame after the arrest.

9

Now I don't think you can do just the

10

arrest because, you know, you get back to the

11

station house, you consult with the

12

prosecutors, and it turns out the statute's

13

different than the statute you thought, so it's

14

not waving the weapon, it's reckless

15

endangerment, but everybody knows it's the same

16

course of conduct.

17

But you could set some timeline on it

18

like that, and we suggested in our brief as a

19

-- as a fallback from Devenpeck that where you

20

have criminal charges, it's the charges

21

identified up to and through the criminal

22

complaint, or, in the absence of charges, it's

23

the first stage in the civil litigation when

24

the defendants say, look, you haven't shown a

25

lack of probable cause, there was probable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

cause for these offenses, and their response to

2

the motion to dismiss, you could limit it there

3

so you wouldn't end up with the Lozman-type

4

situation where you have parties casting about

5

at -- at trial.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Wall, the

7

Lohman -- Lozman kind of situation, at least

8

based on the cert petitions that we see, is not

9

so uncommon:

small municipalities where people

10

are supporting one police chief over a

11

different one or someone who has alleged that

12

the police department in that municipality is

13

corrupt, and all of a sudden they're getting a

14

slew of, you know, 25 to 50 building code,

15

jaywalking, crossing a yellow light, every

16

misdemeanor, every violation humanly possible.

17

Your rule would insulate that

18

behavior.

So the question is, is the burden

19

that you're speaking about of there being,

20

perhaps, you've pointed to 10 examples, the

21

briefs, of cases that in your view should not

22

have gone to a jury in the -- in the -- in the

23

Ninth Circuit, so less than half a percent of

24

the cases that were filed alleging retaliatory

25

arrests have actually gone to trial, is it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

worth giving up the protections of 1983 for

2

such a fundamental right as the freedom of

3

speech right?

MR. WALL:

and the reason it hasn't been a huge problem is

because, until recently, you've had qualified

immunity, which you won't have going forward.

The Ninth Circuit has warped the summary

they're going to have to go to a jury.

may it please the Court:

2

In Lozman versus City of Riviera, this

3

Court rejected petitioners' absolute rule

4

requiring proof of a lack of probable cause in

5

all First Amendment retaliation cases.

6

As the Court did in Lozman, the Court

7

should reject the rule here for three primary

8

reasons.

9

First, it would bar meritorious First

10

Amendment cases, retaliation cases, regardless

11

of the evidence that proves supporting those

12

cases.

out meritless cases.

Start with my first point.

18

Petitioners' rule requires dismissal of First

19

Amendment retaliation cases with compelling

evidence of retaliatory conduct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you clarify

22

what is the First Amendment conduct that -- in

23

which Bartlett engaged -­

MR. WILSON:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- with respect to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34

both officers?

2

What was the speech element?

MR. WILSON:

With respect to Officer

3

Nieves, Mr. Bartlett questioned why Officer

4

Nieves wanted to speak with him.

5

Officer Nieves.

6

Nieves that he did not wish to speak with him

7

and asked him to leave him alone.

8
9
10

That angered

And then he told Officer

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the -- the

speech is the right -- the expression interest
is the right not to speak, is that it?

11

MR. WILSON:

That was part of it.

But

12

it was also combined with an expression of, I

13

haven't done anything wrong, please leave me

14

alone.

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how -- how

about the other officer, Weight?
MR. WILSON:

In reference to Officer

18

Weight, Officer -- or, excuse me, Mr. Bartlett

19

approached and expressed his opinion that

20

Officer Weight did not have the right to speak

21

with the minor who had accompanied him to this

22

party without his parent being present.

23

And that angered Officer Weight, and

24

-- and then led to the situation where about

25

this time Officer Nieves arrives, and then you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35

have the video, what's left of the video

2

picking up at that particular junction.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm interested in the

4

third point you made, I think it was, or maybe

5

it was the second one, that there are other

6

mechanisms for screening out the meritless

7

cases.

Is that right?

8

MR. WILSON:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Was that Point 2 or 3

there?

11
12

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. WILSON:

That was my last point

that I can go to.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

On the last

14

point, I assume that you believe that in this

15

case your client's claim would survive

16

qualified immunity and summary judgment, am I

17

-- that it -- it survives -- it -- it satisfies

18

Twombly and it would survive qualified

19

immunity?

20

MR. WILSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that -- doesn't

22

that refute your claim that -- that those

23

doctrines would rule out the rather trivial

24

cases?

25

MR. WILSON:

In terms of -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did your client say

2

anything that was of social importance?

3

is just -- he's not protesting some social

4

issue or making some important point.

5

involved in a personal dispute with a police

6

officer.

7

MR. WILSON:

This

He's

Your Honor, my -- my

8

client was expressing his disagreement with how

9

the officer was conducting his -- his -- his

10

investigation, what he was doing there.

11

In City of Houston versus Hill, this

12

Court identified the right to criticize a

13

police officer as one of the distinguishing

14

features between a police state and a -- and a

15

free country.

16

And so I would certainly submit to the

17

Court that that is an extremely important

18

interest.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Wilson, I

20

think, you know, it's obvious what the paradigm

21

case is that gives a problem to this side, but

22

it's also obvious what the paradigm case is

23

that gives a problem to you, and it's the one

24

that Justice Alito mentioned earlier on.

25

It's an encounter between a police

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

officer and a citizen that goes south.

2

part of going south is that the person who is

3

stopped engages in lots of back-talk to the

4

police officer, which, in combination with some

5

forms of conduct, gives the police officer

6

reason to think that the person should be

7

arrested to prevent some real harm.

8
9

And

So whether it's a resisting arrest
arrest or whether, you know, it's a disorderly

10

conduct or whatever it is, and there's likely

11

to be speech involved in those problematic

12

encounters where we think it's possible that

13

the police officer should arrest the person in

14

order to prevent any greater danger.

15
16

So -- so what do we do with that
category of cases?

17

MR. WILSON:

If the speech is in any

18

way -- if there's any question whether or not

19

the police officer has a right to take that

20

speech into account, then the plaintiffs are

21

going to lose those cases on the basis of

22

qualified immunity.

23

And there's been a number of those

24

cases.

For example, the Fogel versus Collins

25

case, where there was speech involved on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

38

van and it was talking about, I'm a bomber, or

2

something like this, and the officer made

contact with that individual, detained them,

those -­

9

MR. WILSON:

10

-- as a police officer -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

those -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer,

12

but aren't those going to be factual issues in

13

dispute that won't be resolved until trial?

14

MR. WILSON:

I don't -- in a lot of

15

the cases, the -- the speech that was engaged

16

in doesn't particularly seem to be in dispute.

17

In Fogel versus Collins, the speech wasn't in

18

dispute.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a

question of motive, right?
MR. WILSON:

Well, there's two

different things.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A question of

animus or intent.
MR. WILSON:

You -- you have issues

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

where there's the speech is a question.

2

you shift to cases where the question of the

3

officer's intent becomes relevant.

4

Then

And this is one of my points that I

5

think I haven't been able to answer, I want to

6

come back to Justice Alito's question, but I

7

want to answer Your Honor's question too.

8
9

At this time in the Court's history,
we have a situation where the interactions

10

between the citizen and the police officer are

11

being subjected to increasing technology.

12

More and more in the future cases that

13

come before this Court, you see it already in

14

some of the cases that have been in front of

15

this Court, the interaction between the citizen

16

and the police officer is going to be

17

videotaped, recorded, et cetera.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, yeah, let's

19

assume that case where it's all videotapes, and

20

with other people, and they're calling each

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. WILSON:

Okay.

How?

Simply because an arrest

-- a potential arrestee is rude or says

24

offensive things does not establish that the

25

officer retaliated against that arrestee for

that conduct.

2

And -- and whenever you have the

interaction between the citizen documented,

4

then, if there isn't any evidence that shows

5

that the -- the officer retaliated, you can be

6

rude, you can say the things that you want to,

7

but that doesn't mean that the officer

8

retaliated against you.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what does that

11

mean?

What kind of evidence do you need?

Do

12

you need the -- the -- the person who is

bringing the suit to say the officer said that

14

he was arresting me because of something I

15

said?

Is that what you're looking for?

16

MR. WILSON:

I don't think that -­

that that's what you necessarily need.

what you need is to meet the Mt. Healthy test,

19

both prongs of the Mt. Healthy test.

to prove that, but for your speech, you would

not have been arrested, and then the arresting

And let me just -- there's a

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem that I -­

7

I have the same problem.

8

summary judgment deals with this, because you

9

would have thought you'd have a plaintiff, and

I don't see how

10

on the one hand, the plaintiff would have said:

11

I did interrupt the officer.

12

the arrest or criticize what he was doing.

13

said, you're unfair or worse.

14

I did criticize
I

Then you have a police officer who

15

says, that isn't why I arrested him.

Then you

16

have the plaintiff who says, but I can show you

17

that, given the look on his face, given what he

18

said to his colleague, given what dah-dah,

19

dah-dah, dah-dah, it is why he arrested me.

20

Now no one doubts that if the

21

plaintiff is right, that is clearly a violation

22

of the law.

23

with it?

24
25

So what is summary judgment to do

The jury either believes his story or
believes the defendant's story.

And that's why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

we're thinking a large proportion will go to

2

the jury, because -- I won't repeat myself.

3

MR. WILSON:

Your Honor, I think it's

4

telling in the State of Alaska, and this case

5

in particular, the State of Alaska is not the

6

cutting edge of technology.

7

And yet, in the State of Alaska, the

8

evidence was, the testimony from Lieutenant

9

Piscoya, who was the supervisor of both of the

10

officers involved in this case, 95 percent of

11

the interactions between police officers and

12

citizens are recorded in the State of Alaska.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that has

14

nothing to do with it, really, because, in some

15

different state, the state of Oshkosh -- I

16

don't know -- in a different state, there are a

17

lot of people who do say rude things about

18

police officers in their hearing.

19

And there are police officers who do

20

sometimes arrest them.

And there are a set of

21

ambiguous circumstances as to what the true

22

reason was.

23

wrong happened.

24

is a serious violation of the law.

issue in this case.

And you tell me there won't be cases
like that?

I find that hard to accept.

MR. WILSON:

I'm not telling you there

4

isn't going to be cases like that.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but you're saying

6

there aren't many.

7

comes down in your favor, they're saying there

8

will be more.

9

And after this opinion

MR. WILSON:

I think that the

10

experience in the Ninth Circuit disproves the

11

concern that the Court has expressed there.

12

And I would just go back to a case, Tower

13

versus Glover, that I think is very telling.

14

It -- you want to talk about something

15

that's easy to say.

16

the sky is falling, that -- the hysteria.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

It's easy to cry out that

I'm sorry,

that what?

19

MR. WILSON:

That the sky is falling,

20

the hysterics.

You know, if we -- if you allow

21

this case, we're going to be overrun with

22

cases.

23

Well, look at what they said in Tower

24

versus Glover in the context of a client suing

25

the public defender.

One of the defenses in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

that was, if you allow this case, we're going

2

to be overrun with litigation against public

3

defenders.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't quite the

5

argument.

The argument, as I understand it,

6

is, one, yes, there will be more cases.

7

the jury might decide most of them correctly,

8

by the way, but there will be some not.

9

three, this will have a very, perhaps for

Two,

And,

10

better, perhaps for worse, an effect on

11

policemen that they will be very careful and

12

not arrest people whom they should arrest.

13
14

Now that's -- that's the kind of
argument that I think is being made.

15

MR. WILSON:

Certainly.

And -- and

16

the only thing that a police officer needs to

17

be concerned about is to focus on enforcing the

18

law.

19

loyal to enforcing the law, then that -- this

20

situation takes care of itself.

21
22

And as long as a police officer remains

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, that's not

--

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a very

24

-- maybe this is strong -- that's a very

25

cavalier assertion.

And I get back to the fact

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

you have eight officers and you have 10,000

2

people, you have a lot of drinking.

3

I would say the police officers are

4

worried about a lot of things.

And one of the

5

things they're worried about is the first time

6

you get an in-your-face interaction with one of

7

these people, you want to get them, you know,

8

cuffed and out of the way if it's something

9

within the range of disturbing or disorderly.

10

You don't want to sit there and think about it

11

too long.

12

MR. WILSON:

That's fair enough as a

13

general concern.

14

our view, have much traction in light of the

15

facts of this case.

16

It doesn't particularly, in

Bear in mind that the only way you

17

could communicate at this particular event was

18

to get close to somebody and speak with them.

19

There's a very different -- whenever you start

20

talking about probable cause to arrest

21

somebody, there's probable cause in a church

22

and there's probable cause whenever you're in

23

-- out in the middle of Alaska, next to a DJ

24

that's blaring out music extremely loud.

25

Did -- did -- did Mr. MacCoy have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

reason to fear Officer Weight when Officer

2

Weight was standing half the distance that

3

ultimately Officer Weight and Mr. Bartlett were

4

standing?

5

Mr. Bartlett -- the evidence in this

6

case from Mr. Bartlett's standpoint is he

7

approached Officer Weight in a non-threatening

8

manner and simply communicated with Officer

9

Weight in a manner that accomplished him being

10

able to hear that communication.

11

So the idea that this is people

12

screaming at each other in a church simply

13

isn't borne out by the facts of the case.

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But you said that

15

an officer merely needs to enforce the law.

16

But the problem, I think, is that, in a lot of

17

interactions that lead to an arrest, there's

18

going to be something critical said,

19

potentially, of the police before the arrest is

20

made.

21
22
23

MR. WILSON:

That's certainly a

potential, yes.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Common sense,

24

common understanding tells us that, that people

25

say things critical in a hot situation, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. WILSON:

That's correct.

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And so all of

3

those cases, if it's more than rude and

4

offensive, but rude and offensive with

5

something critical of the police, will go to a

6

jury.

Why not?

7

MR. WILSON:

Absolutely not.

8

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

9

MR. WILSON:

Why not?

Because a -- a potential

10

suspect's obnoxious behavior does not form the

11

basis of intent by the police -- even -­

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I understand

13

obnoxious, but obnoxious -- I'm sorry to

14

interrupt -- obnoxious with something critical

15

or skeptical of the police, which leads to the

16

claim that I was arrested because I expressed

17

my view of the police.

18

MR. WILSON:

It's not going to get to

19

the jury because it's not evidence of the

20

officer's intent.

evidence, you don't have sufficient evidence to

22

establish the officer's intent was to retaliate

against you for that free speech, then you

lose.

generally would resolve in summary judgment

because the truth, again, in our opinion, the

truth comes out.

4

And the truth, as a trial attorney,

5

one thing I would like to emphasize to this

powerful thing than I think this Court gives it

circumstances.

11

And the -- in those situations, that

12

would ordinarily resolve in summary judgment

13

because no reasonable juror is going to believe

14

that whenever an officer is confronting an

15

immediate, compelling safety issue, that,

16

actually, the reason you -- you arrested this

17

particular defendant is because he -- he made

18

an insult about your haircut or about your

with the first point that's going to take care

of a significant number of these cases.

23

is that if you bring the charges on cases where

you have the proof that the crime's been

where these cases get screened out, and that is

that, let's be honest, to -- to succeed or have

he would call it a fallback position.

idea that there is a probable cause requirement

rid of the Devenpeck rule, so it would be

11

MR. WILSON:

Our belief is the best

12

rule is that evidence of probable cause is one

13

of the factors that the court should be looking

14

at in this area, and in many instances, it very

15

well may be a dispositive factor.

16

But, in many instances, it may not be

17

and it isn't, because the -- the probative

18

force of probable cause really varies depending

19

on the severity of the offense.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we go

2

back to the rule or why don't you advocate the

3

rule that you set forth in your brief, that a

4

probable cause requirement applies to felonies

5

but not misdemeanors?

6

MR. WILSON:

I -- I think the -- we're

7

-- we are comfortable with that rule with one

8

slight clarification, and that is that I think

9

the use of the word "serious offenses" is a

10

more apt description.

11

exclude petty offenses.

12

only issue that the Court -­

13

But, certainly, it would
And that's really the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're thinking

14

there are some misdemeanors that are fairly

15

serious?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. WILSON:
that might be.

I -- I could imagine some

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I see -- I take

your point.
MR. WILSON:

But -- but, certainly,

21

petty offenses -- and where this -- this issue

22

arises is not in murder investigations.

23

arises where the officer's discretion is at its

24

zenith in terms of him putting his -- his

25

desire, his -- whether he wears his emotions on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

his sleeve or whatever it is about an officer

2

that motivates him to act in these situations,

3

and -- and they involve petty offenses,

4

obstructing the sidewalk, disorderly conduct,

5

it amounts to nothing other than the officer's

6

kind of way to retaliate in some circumstances

7

against an individual because they've exercised

8

their free speech rights.

9
10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is -- is

disorderly conduct always a petty offense?
MR. WILSON:

I think, in most

12

instance, it is, but there's some -- I could

13

envision some that it may not be.

14

disorderly conduct -­

15
16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If, in fact,

So it's not

enough to just look at what the charge is?
MR. WILSON:

I think that, again, what

18

we're proposing is -- is that the court view

19

probable cause in light -- as a significant

20

factor but not necessarily a controlling factor

21

in whether or not you can state a First

22

Amendment retaliation case.

23

And that allows the court to stay

24

focused on the truth, loyal to the wording of

25

Section 1983, and at the same time get to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

bottom of these cases in an efficient manner.

2

And I want to talk, just if I could

3

real -- real briefly, about the common law.

4

And I'll make one other point before I get

5

there.

6

talked about -- you know, said, well, the

7

hysterics -- you know, the defense to this is

8

that, if we allow this, the sky is going to

9

fall, you're going to be overrun with this

10

In Tower versus Glover, this Court

litigation.

11

The Court's answer to that in Tower

12

versus Glover was:

13

make that argument to Congress.

14

this Court in a legislative role because you

15

believe that the law as drafted by Congress is

16

going to lead to an undesirable result.

17

If that's true, you need to
You don't put

In Tower versus Glover, the Court said

18

that is up to Congress to decide, not this

19

Court.

20
21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what law

is -- is Congress supposed to change?
MR. WILSON:

The Section 1983.

For

23

example, in the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act.

24

Whenever Congress perceived that prisoner

25

litigation was out of control, they went back

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

and they amended Section 1983 to deal with that

2

problem.

3

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The Congress

4

argument -- the Congress argument can cut both

5

ways, of course.

6

Hartman analogy here and to follow what the

7

other side says is the common law, Congress

8

could always change the law to expand.

9

not sure that gets you that far.

10

If we were to follow the

MR. WILSON:

So I'm

Well, it gets us that far

11

because the starting point is what does the

12

statute say.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, the starting

14

point is precedent, what the statute says and

15

what -- the precedent says we look at the

16

common law.

17

precedent to look at.

18

law analogies, and the other is just Hartman

19

itself.

20

precedent, I think you're about to respond to

21

those, but I would like you to.

22

So we have two strands of
One, look at the common

And to do both those strands of

MR. WILSON:

Sure.

And -- and I guess

23

there's an important concession, I believe, in

24

this case by the Petitioners, and that

25

concession is that at -- at the common law,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

that there was no probable cause defense to a

2

wrongful arrest for misdemeanors.

3

dispute amongst the parties as to that point.

4

This is a misdemeanor offense.

5

There's no

The -- the common law rule would be

6

no -- no defense of probable cause for a

7

misdemeanor offense; the Petitioners lose in

8

this case.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think the

10

Petitioners say that that was because there was

11

no right to arrest at all.

12

MR. WILSON:

But they're wrong about

13

that.

14

clear, you had -- a constable had the right to

15

arrest for an affray and he also had the right

16

to arrest for offenses that were committed in

17

their presence.

18

to arrest.

19

had those rights, they were held liable if they

20

got it wrong.

21

And as the first Restatement makes

And so they did have the right

And, nonetheless, even though they

And so I think that the Court need no

22

go -- go no further in this case than to look

23

at the common law and say no PC defense -- no

24

probable cause defense for misdemeanors at the

25

common law.

If you want to look to the common

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

law for guidance in this case of wrongful or

2

retaliatory arrest, that means that the

3

Petitioners lose.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

What approach have we

5

taken in prior cases involving the necessary

6

elements of proof in the 1983 action?

7

said that we will import the common law rule as

8

of 1871 entirely, or has that been a

9

consideration in our decision-making?

10

MR. WILSON:

Have we

Justice Alito, it's been

11

a consideration in that the Court does not -­

12

not necessarily just impart them in whole, but

13

it can adopt various things as it sees in light

14

of the intent of Section 1983.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

So do you think we

16

should do that here?

17

arguing a minute ago that we should just adopt

18

whatever the common law rule was.

19

MR. WILSON:

Or I thought you were

My point was is if you go

20

to the common law, our position is you start

21

with the statute, the statute says we prevail

22

in this case.

23

common law says that we prevail in this case.

You go to the common law, the

24

And even when you get into the felony

25

area, the one case where this Court has spoken

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

in -- in that regard was Dinsman versus Wilkes.

2

And it said in Dinsman versus Wilkes that the

3

only defense where -- the only instance where

4

probable cause was a defense is in a

5

retaliatory prosecution case, which this Court

6

has already addressed in the Hartman versus

7

Moore circumstance.

8
9

So I don't think that if you go down
that path it gets you where they want to go in

10

any instance.

11

common law in kind of fitting those pieces

12

together.

13

So that's our analysis of the

I did want to touch just real briefly

14

on one kind of aspect of the -- actually, I'm

15

out of time, sorry.

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can touch

briefly on it.

18

MR. WILSON:

I'll just say the typical

19

case.

20

Court to realize what the typical case is not.

21

It's not the cases that are concerning this

22

Court about this issue.

23

I think it's very important for this

The typical case is where, like in

24

Ford versus City of Yakima, there's actually -­

25

what drives these cases is hard evidence, solid

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

evidence that there's a retaliatory intent on

2

the part of an officer, frequently recorded or

3

otherwise documented firmly.

4

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

counsel.

8

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARIO BORGHESAN

9
10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BORGHESAN:

Thank you.

And I

11

start out by pointing that this case in front

12

of the Court is a typical arrest scenario that

13

the Court needs to be concerned about in

14

crafting the rule.

15

On the common law point, it's not

16

correct that there was never authority to

17

arrest based on probable cause for misdemeanors

18

at common law.

19

specific law of the jurisdiction and statute,

20

but the -- but the bigger point is that when

21

the common law did authorize officers to arrest

22

based on probable cause, then, if there were

23

probable cause to make that arrest, the arrest

24

was privileged and there'd be no liability.

25

The authority depended on the

And that's the rule we're asking for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

here, where, today, virtually every officer is

2

authorized to arrest based on probable cause.

3

A small point.

It's -- I don't think

4

it's correct that a -- that a conviction for a

5

crime bars a retaliatory arrest lawsuit arising

6

out of that crime.

7

v. Snyder case.

8

Westlaw cite, and I don't know the citation off

9

the top of my head, but one was made and

It's the Meheilieichi

And I apologize, it's a

10

survived summary judgment despite the fact that

11

the plaintiff had been convicted of the

12

offense.

13

And that makes sense for the reason

14

Justice Kavanaugh was pointing out.

15

doesn't bar those claims, because, in Heck, the

16

bar is would the civil litigation call into

17

question the validity of the criminal judgment.

18

Heck

And a retaliatory arrest litigation

19

doesn't call into question the validity of the

20

criminal adjustment -- judgment.

21

that should have never happened or wouldn't

22

have ever happened if not for the bad motive.

23
