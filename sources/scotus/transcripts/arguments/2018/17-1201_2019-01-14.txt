CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 17-1201,

5

Thacker versus the Tennessee Valley Authority.

6

Mr. Rouse.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKLIN TAYLOR ROUSE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ROUSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Congress created the Tennessee Valley

12

Authority as a corporation that could sue and

13

be sued.

14

otherwise specifically provided in this Act,

15

the corporation may sue and be sued in its

16

corporate name.

17

The TVA Act states:

Except as

Nothing in the TVA Act specifically

18

provides the exception that the TVA now urges,

19

immunity for what it calls discretionary work.

20

And for new --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

22

you denouncing the existence of a core

23

government activity not being immunized?

24

Whether to place a dam or not?

25

MR. ROUSE:

No, this -- this --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Are

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

there's two totally separate things.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Our --

No, they're

3

basically the same, which is how far does -- if

4

you recognize some core government functions

5

performed by the TVA, how far does that

6

immunity go?

7

us?

8

Isn't that the question before

MR. ROUSE:

I -- I think so, but I --

9

in -- in this circumstance is -- the conduct at

10

issue is raising a power line out of the water,

11

replacing an electrical conductor.

12

might be said about deciding where to put a dam

13

or how to -- to manage the flow of the

14

Tennessee River and to change its course or

15

anything like that, it's -- this conduct just

16

does not implicate that.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Whatever

Well, I

18

suppose it depends at what level of generality

19

you describe the conduct.

20

if you talk about a particular, you know, cable

21

at a particular place, but if you decide -- if

22

you describe the -- what is at issue is

23

regulating safety along the waterway, then

24

maybe it starts to sound like -- like more the

25

exceptions that were talked about in Burr?

Perhaps you're right

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

MR. ROUSE:

And that may and would --

2

and I think those exceptions would certainly

3

implicate the Federal Tort Claims Act and the

4

discretionary -- discretionary immunity there.

5

But, under Burr, I think the -- the

6

question begins with the presumption that --

7

that Congress has taken this entity, it has

8

created it; it has not made it a new executive

9

department, but it has said it can sue and be

10

sued in its own name.

11

said it can fend for itself.

12

to do its own work.

13

but we're going to withhold others.

14

It has cast it aside and
We're allowing it

We'll give it some powers,

And so there's got to be some

15

deference to Congress that Congress took these

16

steps.

17

functions, it's governmental, and you start

18

making that distinction is the exact error that

19

we think that the lower courts made here.

20

And to just say, well, it performs some

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you think this

21

is supposed to work?

If we just -- if -- if

22

the court just applies Burr, how is -- how is

23

the court supposed to proceed in determining

24

whether there is immunity?

25

a case-by-case determination whether the

Look at the -- make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

particular claim in that case falls within the

2

-- the two categories set out in Burr, so is it

3

consistent with the statutory and

4

constitutional scheme, or, more to the point,

5

does -- is it necessary to have immunity to

6

avoid grave interference with the performance

7

of a governmental function?

8
9

MR. ROUSE:

So under -- I think under

the test that at least the second prong --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. ROUSE:

Okay.

-- certainly looks at the

12

specific conduct at issue, and it says, what

13

proof do you have that immunity here is needed?

14

It must -- it must be clearly shown that it is

15

necessary to prevent some grave interference

16

with the performance of a governmental

17

function.

18

Not just it may be tougher, it may be

19

harder, or you may have to pay normal tort

20

damages, but what grave interference is present

21

here?

22

Whereas -JUSTICE ALITO:

You think this is --

23

this is to be done a case-by-case basis or

24

categorical basis?

25

MR. ROUSE:

I think that under the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

second prong, a -- a case-by-case basis is

2

going to be the more usual result, but, under

3

the first prong, you're looking at, is this the

4

type of suit that is consistent or inconsistent

5

with the statutory or constitutional scheme?

6

In this circumstance, there's no real

7

argument that this case is inconsistent with

8

the statutory scheme.

9

liability here will somehow mean the TVA can't

There's no doubt that

10

do its other functions or anything like that.

11

It's not --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess there is some

13

-- I guess there is some argument on the other

14

side, and I take it that a main argument that

15

registered in my mind was where Justice

16

Sotomayor started out.

17

and say let's do it on a case-by-case basis.

18

And you reply to that

Well, subsequent to Burr, Congress

19

enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act.

20

it contains a discretionary exemption.

21

there's a well-worked-out body of

22

jurisprudence.

23

Under -And

And so what you're asking us to do is

24

to have each court decide each thing that the

25

TVA and probably 100 other government agencies

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

with a sue-and-be-sued clause does and decide

2

case by case, which is what you said, whether

3

it does or does not fall within the

4

discretionary exemption.

5

That seems to me a very complex,

6

difficult decision that could end up with

7

probably a hundred cases before this Court

8

deciding what this different thing, serving the

9

same purpose, does.

10

Now that, I think, is at least one

11

argument that I'd like to hear your response

12

to.

13

MR. ROUSE:

The Burr test, we believe,

14

is actually much easier to look at for the

15

judiciary than the Federal Tort Claims Act

16

test.

17

at the conduct at issue, whether -- it looks at

18

statutes and internal policies, and then it

19

asks the court to say, is this the type of

20

conduct that is susceptible to policy analysis?

21

Is this what --

The Federal Tort Claims Act test looks

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. ROUSE:

Uh-huh.

-- that Congress was

24

trying to protect under the FTCA?

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I take it if we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

apply Burr, we have to go case by case and

2

decide whether, for other reasons, it was

3

plainly the purpose of Congress to use

4

sue-and-be-sued clause in a narrow sense.

5

we have to decide just what you said, case by

6

case.

7

And

So my question is not whether case by

8

case, but do you do that without reference to

9

the well-worked-out body of discretionary

10

exception law under the FTCA?

11

point.

12

MR. ROUSE:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the

Yes.
I mean, you'll --

14

you're saying don't use the FTCA; use Burr.

15

And I want to know, is that a big difference?

16

And if that is a big difference, is it case by

17

case?

18

And that's where my question came from.
MR. ROUSE:

It is a big difference,

19

totally separate.

20

easier for the judiciary in its traditional

21

role of -- of looking at things that -- what

22

has Congress enacted?

23

And the Burr test is much

Under the first -- under the first

24

prong of Burr, you're just looking at whether

25

the type of suit -- don't have to look anything

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

further than the complaint.

2

challenged conduct?

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the

And Burr -- look,

4

I'll say -- try it once more.

We started with

5

Justice Sotomayor.

6

somebody's hurt during the building of a dam.

7

There are farmers, their land is flooded by the

8

dam, their crops might be destroyed.

9

many kinds of crops.

They build dams.

Well,

There are

There are many ways of

10

building dams.

11

and against deciding whether there's a dam.

12

Okay?

13

There are many arguments for

What do you want us to do?

Look to

14

the FTCA or something different?

15

question that I think you were beginning with.

16

And it seemed -- I wanted to follow up because

17

that seems the central issue in the case to me.

18

MR. ROUSE:

That's the

We should look at Burr.

19

And under Burr, the presumption begins with the

20

fact that Congress has launched this entity,

21

that it has --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let --

23

let me phrase it slightly differently.

24

argument based on the sue-to-be -- permission

25

to sue and be sued clause, or is it welded in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Is your

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

-- in part in the fact that the TVA was

2

excluded from the FTCA?

3

I think, once you start with that it

4

was excluded, then we have to figure out what

5

applies, right?

6

MR. ROUSE:

Correct.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And why we should

8

keep the FTCA in when Congress told us not to.

9

Correct?

10

MR. ROUSE:

Well -- correct.

The

11

Federal Tort Claims Act just does not apply.

12

The TVA is exempted.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's three

entities that were excluded from the FTCA.

15

MR. ROUSE:

Correct.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how much does

17

your argument rely on the sue-to-be-sued clause

18

or -- or the exclusion of the TVA?

19

MR. ROUSE:

Well, it's a little of

20

both and it's this Court's precedent.

21

Meyer in 1994 --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In -- in

All right.

So, if

23

it's -- if it's this Court's precedent, then

24

give us a reason addressing Justice Breyer's

25

point, which is the Burr analysis, since, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

definition, it has to involve a case-by-case

2

analysis.

3
4

I think, but I'm not sure, were you
saying that so does the discretionary --

5

MR. ROUSE:

6

there.

7

--

8
9

Correct.

The complaint is there.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. ROUSE:

11

require a case-by-case basis.

So both of them

They're both going to

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Justice Breyer is saying --

14

16

And so under

require a case-by-case analysis?

10

15

The lawsuit is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think what

Well, that's true --

please.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, that

17

the discretionary policy exemption is less

18

complex than the Burr rule.

19

MR. ROUSE:

I believe that at least

20

where the judiciary is concerned it's -- it --

21

it's -- it might be more complex in some ways

22

but less complex in other ways.

23

more complex in that it requires you to take a

24

much deeper look into the facts of the case

25

than Burr.

It might be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

Burr is just looking at is this the

2

type of suit that was not contemplated by the

3

statute.

4

You don't have to do anything other than the

5

complaint.

6
7
8

And so then you look at the statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's on step 1.

But step 2?
MR. ROUSE:

That's on step 1.

On step

9

2, yeah, there -- there needs to be a showing.

10

And the idea is that Congress has launched this

11

entity out.

12

now it has the proof to show -- it has the

13

burden to submit proof to show that immunity is

14

needed here.

It has made it sueable.

15

And we don't have that here.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

And so

But that makes

17

it sound, Mr. Rouse, and I think this is what

18

everybody is getting to, is that you're saying

19

in most cases we have the discretionary

20

function exception.

21

the TVA or other entities like the TVA, we're

22

essentially going to have a discretionary

23

function exception light.

24
25

And here, with respect to

We're going to have something where we
look to the same concerns, the same animating

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

purposes, but we just have a higher bar.

2

that what we're doing, or is it a different

3

inquiry in kind?

4
5
6

MR. ROUSE:

Is

It is a different inquiry

in kind.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's what I'm

7

not getting, because if you, again, focus, as

8

Justice Sotomayor said, on the question of

9

intrusion, impedement of -- of government

10

operations, it seems like the same inquiry,

11

just a higher standard --

12

MR. ROUSE:

So --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. ROUSE:

-- a higher bar.

-- the Federal Tort Claims

15

Act was by Congress.

16

this Court, at least under the Federal Tort

17

Claims Act, has never said, as a matter of

18

separation of powers, the discretionary

19

function exception in the Federal Tort Claims

20

Act exists in all areas of law.

21

said that.

22

Congress has never --

It's never

It actually -- the Court used very

23

specific language in saying, in Varig Airlines,

24

which my friends at the TVA try to draw so many

25

distinctions -- or so many lessons from, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

Court in there said Congress -- Congress wished

2

to prevent judicial second-guessing.

3

And by fashioning an exception,

4

Congress took steps to handicap -- to protect

5

the handicap of efficient government

6

operations.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Here's what bothers me

8

about this case, and I'll ask the same

9

question, if I have a chance, to the Assistant

10
11

to the Solicitor General.
The -- the TVA does some things that

12

are purely governmental and it does some things

13

that are pretty much purely commercial.

14

hybrid entity.

15

It's a

As to the -- as to its commercial

16

activities, it's hard to see why a -- a

17

business should be exempt from tort liability

18

for every discretionary business decision that

19

the business makes.

20

But, as to its governmental

21

activities, it's kind of hard to see why the

22

regime should be different from the regime

23

under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

24
25

Now, under Burr, the Court is supposed
to ask, you say, whether it interferes with a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

governmental function, but I'm not quite sure

2

what is the governmental function when you're

3

talking about a hybrid entity like that.

4

it mean something that only the government can

5

do?

6

MR. ROUSE:

No.

Does

I mean, the case

7

we're talking about here involves something

8

contractors could do.

9

labor.

It's inherent work a day

But, under -- under Burr, the -- the

10

governmental function, I believe, it is -- it

11

is -- it takes into higher account -- it just

12

doesn't concern that.

13

serves much larger purposes in that it can do

14

things and things can be protected under Burr,

15

such as, you know, its -- its economic and its

16

regulatory or policy decisions.

17
18
19

It concerns that the TVA

All of those things can be protected
under Burr.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

You see, I think, Mr.

20

Rouse, what Justice Alito may be offering you

21

is a way out of the difficulty of some of these

22

questions, is that, with respect to some of the

23

TVA's functions, we shouldn't be applying

24

something that's sort of like the discretionary

25

function exception but not really like the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

discretionary function exception.

2

Rather, we should be applying nothing.

3

With respect to the commercial functions of the

4

TVA, the TVA ought to be treated just like any

5

other corporate entity.

6

MR. ROUSE:

We absolutely think that's

7

the case here.

8

not mandated to do any of the work that was

9

involved here.

10

This is -- this -- the TVA is

This is a choice that it makes.

And it is a choice that it makes, and

11

it accomplishes that goal without any funding

12

or appropriations from Congress.

13

its activities are completely self-funded.

14

Its -- all of

And it just doesn't concern -- the

15

federal government is just not concerned with

16

it at this point.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. ROUSE:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. ROUSE:

Part --

Maybe -Go ahead.

Maybe in -- in

21

historical -- in the Depression Era times, in

22

the Tennessee Valley, during that point in

23

time, but now it is doing all of the stuff on

24

its own, without help, without anything like

25

that, and it's making profit, profit that it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

not turning back over to the U.S. Treasury.

2

It's operating just as a private corporation.

3

And so we absolutely think that --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sorry.

There are

5

some functions it does that are governmental.

6

We're trying to get to the dividing line.

7

Justice Alito said, if it's commercial, it

8

should not be subject to any exemption.

9
10

If it's governmental, are you agreeing
that it does receive immunity?

11
12

And

MR. ROUSE:

Only if the TVA shows that

it clearly meets one of the Burr prongs.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

14

let's assume it does, where to build a dam.

15

that governmental enough for you?

16

MR. ROUSE:

Is

I don't know under those

17

circumstances, but I will point the Court to an

18

example that the Court has actually considered,

19

and this is a pre-Burr case.

20

Electric Power Company versus TVA, and 306 U.S.

21

118.

22

was the TVA.

23

power company sought an injunction against the

24

TVA so that it could not produce or sell power

25

at all.

It's Tennessee

And in that case, the challenged conduct
Somebody sought a -- a private

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it seems to

2

me that that's really a close question, isn't

3

it?

4

MR. ROUSE:

I -- I -- I think that

5

under those cases, because the Court in that

6

case --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

on common ground.

9

that are governmental.

10

There are some functions
You're unwilling to

specify which at the moment.

11
12

Let's assume we --

But do you -- do you agree that there
are some functions that may be governmental?

13

MR. ROUSE:

There are some functions

14

that may be governmental and Burr accounts

15

for --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that's fine.

17

The question before us is what to do about the

18

middle stuff, or are you saying this is just

19

commercial?

20

commercial, explain the Chief Justice's

21

description of why it might not be just

22

commercial, and how do we draw that line?

23

And if you're saying it's just

MR. ROUSE:

It's not whether something

24

is commercial or not commercial.

I think the

25

commercial activity certainly imply more --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

less immunity -- or apply less immunity.

2

there's got to be some sort of deference that

3

Congress has -- what Congress has done, and

4

that Congress has completely stripped this

5

entity of the immunity under this Court's law.

6

This Court has said that these waivers are

7

broad, that they must be liberally construed,

8

that any exceptions must be narrowly construed.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

But

You said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we've

been completely stripped, right?

13

recognized that there are circumstances under

14

which the TVA, as well as these other entities

15

that are carved out of the FTCA, nonetheless

16

have immunity.

17

MR. ROUSE:

We've

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

18

absolutely, that there are circumstances.

19

here, in this case, we don't believe, one, that

20

that implicates the kind of immunities under

21

Burr that this Court talked about.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

need some examples of ones you think are

24

But,

Well, maybe we

I mean, one of the things the TVA

So, at a particular moment, it has a choice

2

whether to let more water through, which may

3

damage lower downstream farms, or keep more

4

water back, which might damage upstream farms.

5

Now, if you're downstream and you're

6

injured, can you bring a negligence action

7

against the TVA for that decision, and show --

8

for example, show they -- they did the

9

calculations wrong because of pure negligence?

10

Can you bring that action against the FT --

11

against the TVA?

12

MR. ROUSE:

I think so.

I think that

13

under that action you can, because, one, you're

14

not talking about the -- there's no statutory

15

scheme issue.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So flood

17

control is something that you can sue the TVA

18

on?

20
21

MR. ROUSE:

There are certain

circumstances where, absolutely, I think so.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what are

22

-- give me an example of something you can't

23

sue them on.

MR. ROUSE:

I think that if I'm a

private landowner and I've got land on the --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

right on the banks of the Tennessee River, and

2

the TVA wants to exercise some of the power

3

that Congress has given it in being able to use

4

eminent domain, take land to put up power

5

lines, then I can't turn around and sue the TVA

6

and say no, you can't do that.

7
8

That is one of those things where, no,
Congress has --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

can't sue -- you can't sue somebody with

11

eminent domain power anytime.

12

they're giving you -- if you -- if they have

13

eminent domain power, they're paying you for

14

it, so you can't sue them to -- to stop it.

15

MR. ROUSE:

Well, but you

I mean, if

Or a -- or, I guess, a --

a negligence action saying no, you should have

17

put the -- the lines -- you're going to take my

18

land, you should have taken my neighbor's land

19

and put the lines that way.

20

that is something that the statutory scheme

here necessarily contemplates.

I don't know that

But I do think that Congress -- and if

do you think about that?

I think that there --

implicate the type of governmental conduct that

Burr's second prong is written to protect.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And are you --

just so I understand your argument here, are

you asking us to simply hold that the right

test is Burr, instead of discretionary

function, and then to remand for application of

Burr in the first instance by the court of

appeals?

think at a maximum -- that we can live with

MR. ROUSE:

The maximum is that we can

look at this as a 12(b)(1) dismissal, we can

take the facts as stated in the complaint, in

just not the type of conduct that is

Burr does apply.

23

agree with that?

MR. ROUSE:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So let's go

5

back and see if you have anything else to say.

6

Suppose we wrote this in the opinion.

7

Yes, when the TVA is performing a governmental

function, the FTCA does apply, i.e., the

9

discretionary exemption part.

But when it is

10

not and acting just like a private business

person, it doesn't.

Does that satisfy you?

leave it to the lower courts to decide which is

which.

satisfy you?

argued in this case is that Burr is the test.

No, they don't

disagree that Burr applies.

21

I'm right about that.

22

there is an exemption from the FTCA.

23

I think -- I think

They don't disagree that

who's right or wrong, but what are the words

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think that the

functions.

the legislative history of the Federal Tort

By the way, if it

exception, for example, TVA doesn't assert

20

So the intentional torts

exception, which has this unique pedigree in

the common law leading up to the enactment of

the Federal Tort Claims Act that -- that TVA

asserts in court.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. O'Connell,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

how does that make it any different from all

the agencies that are subject to the FTCA?

again -- and you have to say this, because

concerned on the heels of the Depression about

subjecting residents of the Tennessee Valley to

And so, at the time TVA was excluded,

2

you know, the legislative history of the FTCA

3

shows that it was Congress's understanding that

4

even if it didn't enact a statutory exception,

5

that courts would have come to the same place

by judicial construction, and there's nothing

to indicate that the TVA was uniquely outside

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

It's -- the

23

separation of powers principle that's at play

24

is -- is the one that's protected by the

25

discretionary-function immunity historically,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37

which is that you don't want courts

2

second-guessing the discretionary decisions of

the -- the Executive Branch.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but

5

this wouldn't be unusual, whichever side of the

6

case wins, that handling a tort case is --

7

we're not intruding upon Congress's functions.

8

That's what we do every day.

9

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

10

be -- well, intruding on the -- on the

11

executive functions, and --

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It -- it would

Well, but,

13

Ms. Adams, on that, I was stuck where the Chief

14

was on -- on your brief.

15

-- I -- I don't take you to be arguing, but I'm

16

not sure -- that Congress is unable to waive

17

sovereign immunity?

And are you arguing

18

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No.

So Congress could

20

waive even the executive's immunity on

21

discretionary functions?

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Yes.

And the --

23

the question here is just whether -- whether

24

you think Congress has done so by enacting a

25

general sue-and-be-sued clause with all of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

these other indications that Congress

2

understood that discretionary-function immunity

3

would survive --

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I mean, it would be

5

perfectly sensible if Congress wanted to

6

create, say, a cola company because it thought

7

there wasn't sufficient competition in the soft

8

drink industry, a true commercial entity, that

9

it would allow suit for negligence and those --

10

against such an entity so that it has to

11

internalize its costs of operation and compete

12

on equal footing with other private commercial

13

entities.

14
15

That would be perfectly appropriate in
the government's view I -- I take it?

16

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.

Okay.

So why isn't

18

it a strike against your interpretation that

19

you -- you would interpret the

20

discretionary-function so broad as to not just

21

encompass classic governmental decisions but

22

really pretty ministerial commercial activity

23

by the TVA, like raising a power line?

24

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

25

If there's

something that's a -- that's a ministerial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

decision, that's going to be kicked out under

2

the second prong or under the discretionary

3

function.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But -- but the

5

government's not -- the government would defend

6

the judgment in this case.

7

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Yes.

Okay.

Yeah.

And -- and I

10

guess I should go back to this distinction

11

between commercial and governmental activities.

12

So, historically, the

13

discretionary-function immunity protected both

14

officers and agencies that were engaged in any

15

function, regardless of whether it was

16

commercial or governmental.

17

And so there's been no distinction as

18

this doctrine has developed between those

19

different types of activities.

20

distinction seems to be coming from the Court's

21

opinion in Burr, where the Court says it has to

22

be a grave interference with a governmental

23

function in order for these exceptions to

24

apply.

distinguishing between governmental and

2

commercial activities.

3

"governmental," but it didn't contrast it to

4

something else that would be commercial.

5

It -- it used the word

The issue in that case was whether an

6

agency could be sued for garnishment of wages

7

that it owed to an employee, and the Court said

8

that's not the type of thing we're talking

9

about.

10

The agency tried to make an argument

11

that if it had to process all these garnishment

12

requests that would interfere with --

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, basically, you're

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. O'Connell, I

--

-- I think -JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.

Your

18

argument is that every discretionary decision

19

that the TVA makes in doing exactly the sort of

20

thing that is done by a private power company

21

is covered by sovereign immunity?

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

Correct.

Governmental doesn't

-- is not distinguished from commercial?
MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

No.

And -- and,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

you know, that's -- the TVA -- this Court's

2

cases have kind of thrown cold water on that

3

distinction between governmental and commercial

4

activities, so TVA is specifically authorized

5

to build power lines, and, you know, that was

6

one of the -- the main reasons why it was

7

created in the 1930s, was to bring electricity

8

to this area of the country when commercial

9

power companies would not.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if TVA does --

11

engages in an act of negligence in doing

12

exactly the same thing that is done every day

13

by, let's say, PEPCO, the TVA is completely

14

immune?

15

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

If it's a -- if

16

it involves the exercise of discretionary

17

judgment, yes.

18

other agencies.

19

And that's not different from

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Shouldn't --

20

shouldn't we expect a little more clarity from

21

Congress than that?

22

wishes to compete in private industry and the

23

commercial world, shouldn't we expect the

24

government to make it clear that it wishes to

25

retain its immunity a little bit more clearly

If -- if the government

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

than enacting a statute that says the entity

2

may be sued?

3
4

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:
don't think so.

5

I don't -- I

And --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I mean, those are

6

the only words we have in the statute.

7

asking us to embroider them quite a bit, aren't

8

you?

9

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

You're

When the Federal

10

Tort Claims Act was enacted, the legislative

11

history shows that Congress understood that --

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm not interested

13

in that, as you know, Ms. Adams.

14

about the words.

15

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Talk to me

No, I know, but

16

the idea is that Congress brought

17

sue-and-be-sued entities under the scope of the

18

Federal Tort Claims Act.

19

history shows that its understanding was those

20

entities would have received

21

discretionary-function immunity even without

22

the statutory exception.

23

And -- and the

So I don't think Congress ever drew

24

that distinction.

And it's not just that PEPCO

25

could put up a power line or something like

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

that, but other government agencies do that

2

too.

3

The Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of

4

Reclamation, they have -- create hydroelectric

5

power --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the original --

7

the origin, the origin.

8

because I -- I want to see if I understand

9

that.

10

Go back for a minute,

Before the FTCA and then after the

11

FTCA, I thought by and large, but perhaps not

12

correctly, that the FTCA made it easier for an

13

injured person to sue the government compared

14

to what happened before.

15

wrong?

Is that right or

16

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.

So, if they exempt

18

from the FTCA, that should, in general, make it

19

harder to sue TVA, not easier.

20

bringing in an exemption you want to from --

21

from the FTCA which is not really clear as to

22

what Congress intended.

23
24
25

And now we're

Now do I have the basic framework
correct?
MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

No, because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

while in general --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

3

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

-- the FTCA was

4

a good thing for people and made it easier for

5

people --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

7

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

-- to sue the

8

federal government because there was no waiver

9

of immunity before, in the -- in the Tennessee

10

Valley specifically, there had been an agency

11

operating there and interacting with people in

12

a variety of different ways for about a decade.

13

And so, by scooping the -- the TVA

14

into the Federal Tort Claims Act, it -- it

15

would actually make life harder for those

16

people because, as I explained before, the

17

agency loses settlement authority over a

18

thousand dollars, there's -- there's much less

19

discretion in how to settle the case.

20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:
helpful.

All right.

That's

That's helpful.

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

There's -- the other

24

thing I'm not certain about is, if you look at

25

the power industry, in selling power to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

customers, they're mostly government-owned,

2

municipalities -- or there are loads of

3

government-owned agencies.

4

In transmission, they are by and large

5

privately owned but highly regulated.

6

a few exceptions, the generation of power is

7

privately owned but highly regulated, with the

8

exception, say, of TVA, which is totally

9

government-owned.

10

And with

All right?

Now I'm not sure what Congress did

11

intend to agencies.

12

agencies.

13

they're highly regulated companies and they do

14

a specialized task.

15

companies and -- and they are run by

16

municipalities.

17

Well, they're not

They're private companies, but

Or they're governmental

Is there anything that will help me on

18

that?

And I do look at the legislative

19

history.

20

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Well, I think --

21

I guess the fact that Congress brought

22

sue-and-be-sued agencies generally under the

23

protection of the Federal Tort Claims Act shows

24

that it didn't care what function the agency

25

was performing, whether it was a commercial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

function or some, as -- as the phrase has been

2

used, core governmental function.

3

scooped up within the scope of the Federal Tort

4

Claims Act.

5

They're all

And the legislative history shows that

6

Congress expected that those agencies would be

7

exempted for discretionary decision-making from

8

tort damages even without enacting the

9

statutory exception.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it --

Ms. -But it's --

Ms. O'Connell, if --

14

if -- if -- if I'm a Tennessee resident and I

15

can't sue the TVA for this conduct, for raising

16

a transmission line negligently, what kind of

17

negligent suit can I bring against the TVA?

18

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think the --

19

the typical example, when you have these

20

buckets of things that are discretionary versus

21

things that are not, the typical example of

22

something that doesn't fall within the

23

discretionary-function exception is you're

24

driving down the road and a TVA truck rear-ends

25

you.

That is a -- is a type of tort that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

doesn't involve any kind of exercise of

2

discretion.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

But, with

4

respect to the TVA's actual operations in

5

running a power company, what kind of

6

negligence suit can I bring?

7

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Um --

I mean, you know,

somebody rear-ending you, it's just -- it could

10

be a TVA driver or it could be anybody else on

11

the road.

12

functions that are necessary to run a power

13

company, like raising transmission lines, doing

14

all the things that are necessary to run a

15

power line, what could a Tennessee citizen sue

16

the FD -- the TVA for?

17

The point is in -- in the -- in the

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I mean, I'm --

18

I'm not sure that I have any examples from the

19

case law or anything like that, but it would be

20

similar types of things where you're -- you're

21

walking past and something hits you or

22

something like that, some kind of a -- a -- an

23

action by the agency that didn't involve any

24

discretion in deciding to take a certain

25

action.

So it's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What like if

2

you have, you know, a fence -- you should have

3

had a fence along one of the rivers and you

4

don't, and so, you know, a child runs into the

5

river and is harmed?

6

a -- a car?

7

Is that like rear-ending

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think under --

8

now, again, this is all on Question Presented 2

9

under which the Court did not grant cert, but I

10

think under -- there's a case, Edwards versus

11

TVA, where somebody tried to make a similar

12

example, that they fell into the water near a

13

reservoir, and they should -- there should have

14

been a warning, and the court said no, that the

15

-- how to warn people about the hazards and

16

the -- you know, the economic decisions that go

17

into where you put the signs and how you warn

18

people and things like that involves an

19

exercise of discretion.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

One way to look at

21

this case is that the discretionary-function

22

exemption does not apply because it's not

23

statutorily provided, but, nonetheless, Burr

24

applies in that Burr sets up what seems to me

25

on its face to be a higher bar or a more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

narrower exception than the

2

discretionary-function exception because it

3

uses terms like "grave interference" with

4

governmental function.

5

What is wrong with looking at the case

6

that way?

7

exactly what Burr means either to the court of

8

appeals or future elaboration.

9

Which would leave figuring out

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I -- I don't

10

think that Burr, Justice Kavanaugh, is meant to

11

be a replacement for the discretionary-function

12

test.

13

discretionary-function case.

14

test by which you run individual sets of facts

15

through the Burr test and decide whether or not

16

that case can go forward.

17

It's not -- Burr was not a

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It's not a -- a

But, if we

18

conclude that you don't have this

19

discretionary-function exception because it's

20

not provided in the statute, we're left with

21

Burr, right?

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Right.

Well --

I know -- I know

24

you're fighting the premise of the "if" clause,

25

but if we conclude that, then you're left with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

Burr.

And how do you think Burr should be

2

applied?

3

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think that

4

Burr is what gets you to the point that you say

5

there is a discretionary-function exception.

6

So Burr should be a preliminary step before --

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

8

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS: --

9
10

Right.

discretionary-function test is applied where
the court --

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So -- so you don't

12

do it case by case.

13

discretionary-function exception would cause a

14

grave interference with governmental function?

15

You say to not have a

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

That's exactly

16

right.

17

Burr talks in those same terms, so Burr asks

18

whether a particular category of cases should

19

be allowed to go forward.

20

to run fact patterns through the Burr test case

21

by case.

22

So that's the way that we view Burr.

It doesn't ask you

And the question in Burr, again, was

23

whether the -- the agency, the Federal Housing

24

Administration, was subject to garnishment.

25

And the -- the court analyzed that question on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

a macro basis, not just whether paying this one

2

garnishment order would interfere with the

3

operations of the agency.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, if -- if your

5

answer to Justice Kavanaugh is right, that

6

would mean you are engrafting the FTCA

7

exception onto the TVA, an -- an entity that

8

has been specifically excluded from the FTCA.

9

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

The -- the idea

10

here is that we're -- we're not trying to

11

borrow something from the FTCA that we were

12

specifically excluded from.

14

common law and was carried forward into the

The -- the

It -- they mirror one

And the exclusion of TVA from the

But you see what I'm

20

saying, Ms. O'Connell.

It's that those are --

it's -- you know, you can say, well, we're --

22

we're -- we're formulating the result in a

23

different way.

24

exception; rather, we're engrafting an

25

exception that the FTCA codified.

We're not engrafting the FTCA

But it all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

amounts to the same thing, doesn't it?

2

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

It all amounts

3

to the -- to the idea that TVA gets

4

discretionary-function immunity --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

6

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

-- yes.

But I

7

guess the -- the question is whether you're

8

taking it from a statute that it's been

9

excluded from, which, you know, we completely

10

understand TVA's excluded from the statute, you

11

wouldn't be saying that that -- 2680(a)

12

applies, but that immunity was recognized as a

13

matter of common law before the FTCA was

14

enacted and it's -- it's coterminous with the

15

test that's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

18

relevant to the statute.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I read this to --- that's

Can I read one

20

sentence to you that was just pointed out to

21

me?

22

this, it was -- it was just pointed out, if the

23

city operates a local electric or water company

24

for which fees are charged, this looks very

25

much like private enterprise and is usually

In Prosser, on page 1053, I didn't know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

considered proprietary, for torts committed in

2

these operations then, the city is usually held

3

liable.

4

So that's contrary to what I was

5

thinking before, but that's what Prosser says.

6

And if you hold local electricity companies

7

owned by the city liable for the distribution

8

of electricity, why shouldn't you hold the TVA

9

liable, at least when they're engaged in

10

electricity distribution through wires?

11

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

12

I'm -- I'm not

never been a distinction drawn between

commercial functions and -- and governmental

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Burr itself recognizes that.

But Burr does -Burr says that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

there are some entities that are sued or to be

2

sued that you have to look at differently

3

because they're not functioning merely as

government entities.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I -- I don't -So do you -Respectfully, I

-- I -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you agree that

10

Burr and the discretionary policy exception

11

overlap in some respects?

12

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

No.

I think

13

that Burr is a preliminary test that you use to

14

see whether a category of claims should be

15

excluded and the agency should get --

16

nevertheless get immunity, even though there is

17

a general sue-and-be-sued clause.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Once you --

And some of that

19

has to do with governmental functions and the

discretion the government has in that area?

No.

respectfully, I don't think Burr made that

distinction.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you -- you

3

totally give up the idea that there's any

4

overlap between the two?

5

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

You think they're

just totally --

8
9

Correct.

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think Burr is

a preliminary test.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if you lose,

11

the way Justice Kavanaugh set up the possible

12

loss, Burr controls, you would give up any

13

claim to discretionary function exemption, you

14

would not claim that this interferes with the

15

government because it cabins its discretionary

16

function?

17

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Well, we -- we

18

just don't think that Burr is applied on a

19

case-by-case basis in that way.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know, but if

21

you're wrong, if we decide you're wrong, are

22

you here going to disavow relying on the

23

discretionary exemption in claiming that prong

24

2 is not met under Burr?

25

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I mean, I guess

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

we would still try to argue that, as a category

2

of cases, if you allow -- I mean, I think

3

that's the whole application of Burr, is

4

whether -- I think the dispute in part is

5

whether you look at Burr with respect to

6

categories of cases or on a case-by-case basis.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

But I'm --

8

I'm -- I'm going to try and pin you down just a

9

little bit.

10

argument.

11

Let's assume you've lost that
Okay?

I -- I -- I -- I know.

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

So the argument

12

I've lost is what, that there's no

13

discretionary --

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Is -- is -- is that

15

Burr is just a categorical question,

16

preliminary question, as to whether the

17

discretionary-function exception applies.

18

You've lost that.

19
20

23

Just a hypothesis.

Does the government have any backup
argument at all, or is that the end of it?

21
22

Okay?

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Well, I guess

that -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And I'd -- and I'd

24

really appreciate, if it's possible, to start

25

with a yes or a no.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Yes.

I mean, I

2

-- I think, under Burr, we would still say

3

that, as a category of claims, that it would

4

interfere with the -- with governmental

5

functions or the TVA's functions to allow this

6

category of claims to go forward.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

And by "this category

of claim," what do you mean?

9

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Claims that are

10

-- tort claims for damages for activities that

11

arise from discretionary activities of the

12

executive.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Suppose I

14

think -- this is a similar question, maybe a

15

little bit different -- suppose that I think

16

what we should do is apply Burr, and suppose I

17

think that governmental does not mean

18

commercial, that there's a distinction between

19

the two.

20

How should I proceed after that, or am

21

I just so far down the wrong road that you have

22

nothing -- there's nothing you can do to help

23

me?

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

pretty far down the wrong road at that point,

2

but I think one other thing that I guess I

3

maybe haven't said yet is that, if you're

4

looking whether something is -- is governmental

5

or commercial, if it's a federal government

6

agency doing it, it is a governmental activity.

7

This Court has said that in a couple

8

of different cases.

9

discretionary-function cases, but Federal Land

10

Bank versus the Board of County Commissioners.

11

They're not

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Oh, sure, land --

12

federal lands, absolutely, but if -- if -- if

13

-- if the government were setting up a cola

14

company, why should we, with this very limited

15

language before us, which actually seems to go

16

the other way -- should we require Congress, if

17

it wishes to assert sovereign immunity in cases

18

of classic commercial conduct, like my cola

19

company, to say so a little more clearly than

20

this?

21

us.

22

This, after all, being go ahead and sue

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I think if the

23

-- if the Court is looking for something in

24

terms of the Coca-Cola company or something

25

that is just a purely commercial function,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

there may be room in prong 2 of the actual

2

discretionary-function test for that.

3

The discretionary-function test itself

4

asks first whether this was an act that

5

involved the exercise of discretion and then,

6

second, whether it's grounded in social,

7

economic, or political policy.

8

So maybe the Court could say for --

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, no, that would

10

be grounded in political policy, sure, but

11

that's my whole point of my hypothetical.

12

Congress decided that it needed another cola

13

company in the world, we needed one for some

14

reason, we needed another cola company in the

15

world.

16

clearly, when Congress acts to create a

17

commercial entity.

So there's a political decision there,

18

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

Well, I guess --

So I don't think

that would solve our problem.

21

We'd need something else, wouldn't we?

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

23

guess the -- the TVA is obviously quite

24

different than a Coca-Cola company.

25

aside its power generation activities, as we've

In that case, I

Putting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

talked about for -- for much of the argument,

2

TVA also operates a system of dams on the

3

Tennessee River that often involved --

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Now you're just

5

fighting the hypothetical.

I understand you

6

disagree with the hypothetical.

7

hypothetical, shouldn't we ask Congress to be a

8

little clearer if it wants to provide immunity

9

and allow -- I mean, actually, what we're

But, in that

10

talking about is allowing a commercial entity

11

to externalize its costs, to the victims of its

12

negligence, have to bear the cost, rather than

13

internalize the cost like every other

14

commercial operator has to bear its costs of

15

negligence.

16

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well --

That's quite an

18

extraordinary thing you're asking for, isn't

19

it?

20

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

I -- I'm not

21

sure it is.

This -- again, this is a

22

government agency that was created to do lots

23

of things to bring prosperity to the Tennessee

24

Valley during the Great Depression, and one of

25

those was to bring power and electricity to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

region.

2

It's actually statutorily mandated

3

that it offer power to the -- to the residents

4

of the Tennessee Valley at the lowest cost

5

feasible.

6

well, this is just a typical power company, it

7

should internalize its costs and just raise

8

rates, that -- that may even be inconsistent

9

with the --

So if -- you know, if the idea is,

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

saying lowest cost feasible means, to the

12

extent you can deprive individuals harmed by

13

their activities, purely commercial activities,

14

that that counts in trying to keep the costs

15

low?

16

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

So you're

I mean, I think

17

that's an argument.

We haven't really rolled

18

out that argument, but it is an argument that's

19

in the statute.

20

just --

And -- and, again, I would

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not

22

sure you haven't rolled it out.

The idea that

23

-- that someone who's harmed, who would

24

otherwise get a recovery from a private entity,

25

but because of the immunity doesn't, I thought

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

that was the basic idea.

2

the governmental function to make them pay tort

3

damages.

4

It interferes with

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Well, yeah,

5

perhaps that's right.

6

additional way of saying that it's inconsistent

7

with the statutory scheme to -- to have TVA

8

paying out damages claims and having the -- the

9

-- the court second-guess the discretionary

10

Maybe that's just an

decisions that TVA is making.

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But the -- you're

12

trying to fold the discretionary-function

13

exception into the second part of Burr.

14

But is it really the case -- I guess

15

one response would be is it really the case

16

that you need this broad discretionary-function

17

exception in all these kinds of hypothetical

18

cases that have been raised in order to avoid a

19

grave interference for the governmental

20

function, which seems like a high bar set forth

21

in Burr?

22

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

Yes.

I mean, we

23

-- again, we think that whether to recognize a

24

discretionary-function exception is like what

25

you're applying -- and Burr is not like a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

codified statute.

2

categories of claims that may be excluded from

3

a sue-and-be-sued clause even though Congress

4

has said the agency could be sued.

5

It's describing general

And -- and this is a category of

6

claims that we think, anything involving the

7

exercise of discretion, if you permitted suits

8

allowing that, that it would interfere with the

9

agency's function.

10

So I think that's what we're asking

11

for here, is for the Court to say that, under

12

Burr, TVA gets discretionary-function immunity.

13

And then, in any individual case, you could

14

apply the discretionary-function test to see if

15

the facts of the case meet that

16

well-established immunity.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just on the facts of

18

this case, why would allowing a negligence suit

19

to proceed interfere with important government

20

functions?

21

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MS. O'CONNELL ADAMS:

May I answer?
Sure.
It's -- on the

24

facts of this case, you know, the Petitioners

25

say, well, TVA could continue operating the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

next day, even if they're required to pay out

2

damages to this particular plaintiff.

3

is not set up to be a case-by-case test.

But Burr

4

It's looking for categories of cases

5

that should be excluded, just like paying out

6

damages to one individual person whose crops

7

were destroyed by water that was let out of the

8

reservoir wouldn't be a big deal, but, as a

9

category of cases, those would interfere with

10
11
12
13
14

the government's functions.
