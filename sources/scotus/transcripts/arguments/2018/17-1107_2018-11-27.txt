ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

terminating all sovereignty over the land in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

statehood, the tribe was still in existence.

15

Shortly thereafter, Congress says it's not

16

going to dismember it, and tribal members still

17

owned property, they were getting property, and

18

it was only after that that the government

19

began to -- it wasn't even that it took the

20

land away from the Indians; that through

21

trickery and deceit, they were permitted to

22

sell off their lands, but I'm trying to figure

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry -­

-- for any purpose.
-- what are all

17

the Solomon cases -- all of those tribes, the

18

issue was whether the deprivation of property

19

was an allotment or a cessation, and in many of

20

them, we held it was an allotment because there

21

wasn't clear language of cessation.

22

didn't tie it to the ownership of land.

23

MS. BLATT:

So we

Exactly, and that's my

24

point.

In every single Solem case, you have a

25

statute that transfers surplus non-Indian-owned

Congress also intended to sever the tribe or

divest the land of Indian interest.

5

Parker, in Solem, in Yankton Sioux, cession

6

itself in one step both terminates tribal title

7

and tribal governance.

But Congress is silent as to whether

And so

But, here, what happened with Oklahoma
was that Congress acted in two steps.

It first

10

took away tribal title with allotment, and then

11

20 years of statutes expressly abrogated every

12

feature of tribal sovereignty.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what does that

14

mean, Ms. Blatt?

15

history, it goes something like this -- and you

16

said terminating all sovereignty -- what

17

happened was that, in 1901, Congress said we

18

are going to terminate all sovereignty by 1906.

19

So there was definitely an express intent to do

20

that.

21

Because, as I read the

And then two things happened.

First,

22

as an interim measure, Congress extended the

23

tribal government and it said we're going to

24

extend it in order to wind things up.

25

things up but to extend it.

So, you know, whatever Congress

thought it might want to do, it decided it

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

You're

going to have to go back a little bit for me.

8

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now you're -- are you

10

making a distinction between the tribal

11

government and tribal sovereignty?

12

MS. BLATT:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

Absolutely.
And what is that

distinction?

MS. BLATT:

I'm telling you, every

and what the Court's words were in Solem, where

18

there's a divestiture of the tribal interest in

19

the land, a dissolution of tribal sovereignty,

it has never been required that Congress has to

21

terminate a tribe.

whenever it was, the Enabling Act, 1906, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

the President had to approve it.

2

Now I'm not sure I can find any

3

instance which says because the President has

to approve the laws passed by a tribal council,

5

that that means the tribe does not have

sovereignty.

right on that, I doubt it.

MS. BLATT:

What?

-- Section 28 only

extended the governments for purposes that were

already existing.

16

the actual statute says is that all tribal acts

17

will be invalid, this is a restriction on

approves.

me -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, Ms. Blatt, isn't

7

it true that in this period, the -- the U.S.

8

Government was doing this with respect to many,

9

many Indian tribes.

I mean, in some ways, the

10

Creek was unusual because it had had a good

11

deal more tribal sovereignty than many tribes

12

had had.

13

the theory of the U.S. Government during this

14

period was to try to divest Indian tribes of as

15

many sovereign powers as it could in order to

16

essentially promote assimilation.

17

But all over the place, the -- the -­

So, if we did that, we would have been

18

thinking about this question in every single

19

one of our Solem cases because, in every single

20

one of our Solem cases, much the same history

21

appears, with the U.S. Government progressively

22

trying to strip tribes of various kinds of

23

sovereign powers.

24

There's nothing in particular about

25

the Creek that makes that history different.

That's exactly what

Just title.
We would have been

talking about the stripping of sovereignty if

10

we had thought that that was relevant, because

11

the stripping of sovereignty is there in every

12

single one of the historic background to these

13

cases, that the U.S. Government, at the same

14

time that it was acting with respect to title,

15

was also acting with respect to tribal

sovereignty and was trying to strip the tribes

of sovereignty.

was relevant to the question.

Was there an issue about the extinction of

MS. BLATT:

No.

they did that, then allotment should account

over 100 years in the area it was claiming.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And despite that,

the court didn't say that that was a cessation

17

of the tribe with respect to that area.

They

18

didn't tie it in the way you're saying.

They

19

didn't look at whether there was a lack of

20

sovereignty because the tribe had ceded its

21

responsibilities in some way.

22

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

You're right, the

tribe was absent, but what was not true in

ousting of state jurisdiction.

That was wrong.

I

give you that point, and it was pending cases,

mean, I agree with you that -- that the ball is

5

in tribal courts.

I agree with you.

They did.

6

The second thing, though, I'm not sure

7

because, in 1901, the 1901 allotment agreement,

8

according to my law clerk, what she says is it

eliminate the authority of the Creek National

And that has just never been

In many instances, with respect to

11

many tribes, the idea of a reservation was -­

12

was viewed as perfectly consistent with U.S.

13

Government control over that land.

14

And so -- and that's why we've never

15

thought that where it's sort of measuring

16

tribal power.

17

that what we're trying to figure out was

18

whether there was ever any a time when this

19

reservation, whether the Indians exercised

20

power over it or whether the U.S. Government

21

exercised power over it or whether it was

22

something in between, whether that reservation

23

was ceded to the public domain, was given up.

24
25

What we've always thought is

And that's what Solem emphasizes.
that it seems is -- is missing from your

analysis.
MS. BLATT:

Justice Kagan, I would

3

concede that you have a reservation with any

4

tribal power, not full tribal power or some

5

federal power that displaced state power, but

6

here it's a null set.

7

It's fine, there is no such

8

reservation, but you could have a reservation

9

where just the federal government can control

10
11

non-Indian-owned fee land.
But any -- I'll take any act of tribal

12

sovereignty that the tribe could exercise over

13

the non-Indian-owned fee land and non-tribal

14

member, and they don't even have it over the

15

tribal members because they had none.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

Could I -­

17

could I just go to what I thought cession was

18

about -- Solem was about, which is about this

19

idea of -- of cession.

20

So, as I understand the history, you

21

have this 1893 act and it establishes the Dawes

22

Commission, and it very clearly says, look,

23

there are two alternatives here:

24

either get cession of the land, or you can do

25

allotment of the land and go figure it out.

You can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

And the Dawes Commission goes and it

2

actually tries to get the Indians to cede the

3

land and says we want cession, cession is

4

easier, cession is -- is better, from the U.S.

5

Government's point of view, and for whatever

6

reason, they think that they need tribal

7

consent and the tribes aren't giving that

8

consent, and so the Commission comes back and

9

they say:

10
11

No, we're not going to get cession.

We're only going to get allotment.
And, indeed, that was what happened.

12

They got allotment, not cession, which is what

13

makes all the difference under Solem and

14

Solem's progeny, isn't it?

MS. BLATT:

No.

Remember, Solem was

that domain had become the states, the general

governmental authority.

3

And it did that with respect to

Indians and non-Indians alike, as the history

that -- that preceded it shows.

6

1897, Congress extended the laws of Arkansas to

7

everyone in the Indian territory, irrespective

of race, and gave the Indian territorial courts

exclusive jurisdiction over all cases.

10

Beginning in

The next year, it abolished tribal

courts and said that their laws could not be

enforced in the law -- in the courts of the

what's so interesting about that transfer is

that, in 1906, the Enabling Act does say

transfer, but in 1907, the Enabling Act

of criminal cases.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3

MR. GERSHENGORN:

and may it please the Court:

Justice Thomas's opinion in Parker

from just three terms ago requires that the

7

Tenth Circuit decision be affirmed.

8
9
10

Parker confirmed that the text is what
governs, and the text here is particularly
clear.

11

Congress considered hallmark language

12

that would have disestablished the reservation

13

and Congress rejected it.

14

Congress initially sought cession, and when the

15

Creeks refused to cede their land to the United

16

States, Congress instead enacted text that

17

instead went for only allotment.

18

So, in 1901,

And in 1906, when Congressional

19

inaction would have dissolved the tribe and

20

disestablished the reservation, Congress

21

instead enacted text that preserved the tribal

22

government for all purposes authorized by law,

23

and it did so precisely to prevent the land

24

from going into the public domain.

from the 1906 Five Tribes Act.

Uh-huh.

But Ms. Blatt

that would be my first part.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So,

23

when I read this, I will discover that even

2

read earlier in the 1906 Act, what I will find

is lots of provisions that suggest they're

4

simply winding up affairs, and the purpose of

5

the government is to wind up affairs and then

6

perhaps continue to elect a chief.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

interested in your view.

10

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor -­
That's what I'm

Yes.

So, Your

11

Honor, that's pure ipse dixit.

12

the text says.

13

that Congress had done that wind-up authority.

14

In the 1906 joint resolution that's cited in

15

our brief, Congress had preserved tribal

16

authority until all of the allotments had been

17

made and the deeds had been sent out.

18

That's not what

And what's critical here is

What Congress did in the 19 -- in the

19

Five Tribes Act was something very different.

20

Congress added Section 28, which preserved the

21

tribe for all purposes authorized by law.

22

In -- and it's critical when you think

23

about how this was implemented, as opposed to

24

the text, that the United States opposed that.

25

So Congress implemented Section 20 -- I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

sorry, the United States, the Executive Branch

2

opposed that.

3

Congress implemented Section 28,

4

preserving the tribal authority, over the

objection of the Secretary -­

Could you tell me

what remained?

12

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Yeah.

So, Your

13

Honor, I just -- what remained is the ability

14

to legislate over the land.

15

Now it was dependent on the Secretary

16

approving it and it was dependent on the

17

President approving it.

18

So Executive Branch hostility was a

19

problem.

20

were a number of legislative actions that the

tribe took.

you've got?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

That's -­

So, Your Honor, I -­

5

there is no doubt that the -- in practice, on

the ground, the legislative power of the tribe

was greatly reduced.

tribal extinction.

It was working with an

Congress did.

And what this Court has said is

11

we look to see what Congress did.

12

And the exact purpose -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In terms of

14

the ongoing functioning and relationship, the

15

best example you have of the tribe's continuing

authority is hiring an interpreter?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Then, in 1909 and 1914, when Congress

24

needed to equalize -- equalize allotments, what

25

Congress did was say:

We want to know whether

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

legislature got together and disapproved -­

3

this was in 1909 -- disapproved the

4

Congressional action.

5

The tribal

After 1909, it is -- and the same

6

thing happened in 1914.

7

to step back and -- and distinguish between

8

what Congress did and what was happening on the

9

ground, because I think it's really critical.

10

But I just really want

As we detail in our brief, both the

11

Executive Branch and the state were acting very

12

much in hostility to the tribe, trying to

13

eliminate the tribe.

14

And, in fact, what the Harjo Court

15

said -- I urge the Court to read the Harjo

16

decision, it's cited in our brief -- was this

17

was a campaign of bureaucratic imperialism

18

precisely because the Executive Branch didn't

19

get its way in Section 28, and, therefore, was

20

hostile to the tribe.

21

So, in fact, what the tribe was doing

22

in -- in continuing to legislate was really

23

critical.

24
25

Now what -- what Mr. Kneedler was
suggesting was somehow they had to get rid of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

tribal sovereignty in order for there to be a

2

state.

3

That's just not true, okay?
In 19 -- in 1790, in Tennessee,

4

three-quarters of the state was reservation.

5

When South Dakota came into the union,

6

47 percent of South Dakota was reservation.

7

And when Arizona came in, 24 percent was

8

reservation.

9
10
11

So the idea that you had to eliminate
a reservation is not correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And, in fact -­

That is correct.

12

I wish at some point you would go back to

13

Justice Alito's question.

14

There are 1.8 million people living in

15

this area.

17

regulations, property law, dog-related law,

18

thousands of details.

19

They have built their lives not

And now, if we say really this land,

20

if that's the holding, belongs to the tribe,

21

what happens to all those people?

22

to all those laws?

23

But

What happens

Should we -- for example, were we to

24

decide this -- I'm not saying one way or the

25

other -- do what the court did in Marathon and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45

say Congress has a certain number of months

2

before the -- our holding goes into effect, so

3

you can try to work out whatever compromises

4

are necessary with the state and with the feds

5

and with the tribe?

6

all to the Tenth Circuit?

7

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Should we just leave it
What would you do?
So, Your Honor, I -­

8

I understand the point.

9

which I will then provide more details, my

10

overall answer is the state's concerns are

11

dramatically overstated, but, in any event,

12

this Court has doctrines designed to address

13

it, and what Parker made clear is that's not

14

part of the disestablishment analysis.

15

separate under a Sherrill analysis.

16

And my overall answer,

17

all the kinds of concerns.

19

That's

Let me start with

So, with respect to completed criminal

20

cases, the Tenth Circuit has already held in a

21

case called In Re Brown that you can't bring a

22

by somebody who had no authority to prosecute

What we're talking about, people who

That's a matter or should be a matter

16

of some concern to the government, don't you

17

think?

18

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I -­

19

it is a concern and as are habeas rules, which

20

this Court has repeatedly upheld, and as I say,

21

the Tenth Circuit has addressed this question

22

squarely and said that the cases -- the cases

23

cannot be brought in a second or successive

24

habeas petition.

25

Going forward, Mr. Kneedler identified

the burdens on the government.

2

at the Tenth Circuit, the government said there

3

would be 2,000 cases a year that they had to

deal with.

they said 500 cases a year.

discussion at all of any case numbers.

I will say that

a transfer of resources.

11

doubt that the federal government -­

-- has a lot of

resources.

15
16

There is also no

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is really

-MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, on the civil

side, Justice Breyer -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Yes.
-- which I

21

understand is -- is your concern, I found it

22

interesting that you asked -- that Justice

23

Alito asked Mr. Kneedler what the impact would

24

be, and the thing he identified, which we agree

25

with, is that there will be limits on state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

authority over income tax and sales tax of

2

tribal members on the reservation.

3

I would agree that's significant.

4

would not call it existential.

5

event, this Court has authority under the

6

Sherrill doctrine and certainly Congress has

7

authority to change that.

I

And in any

8

Stepping back, this Court's cases in

9

-- in cases like Plains Commerce Bank and the

10

whole Montana line of cases have drastically

11

limited tribal authority over non-member,

12

non-fee land, even within a reservation.

13

--

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But just to

pause -­

16
17

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I'm asking you -­

yeah.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go ahead.

I'm asking you what

20

-- what you would do if you were me if you

21

thought on all the doctrinal things that you

22

were right.

23

MR. GERSHENGORN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.
Because imagine you

are a small businessman in Tulsa, and suddenly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

our Court decision, and all they know is

2

they're part of the reservation.

3

concerned about is they think I have 5,000 laws

4

already to deal with, infinite numbers of forms

5

to figure out.

6

What I'm

What do I do?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Justice Breyer,

7

I'd like to make a factual point and then a

8

"how would I solve it" point if you thought

9

there was a problem.

10

drastically restricted -­

11
12

This Court has already

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking you

whether there's a problem.

13

MR. GERSHENGORN:

I -- there is not,

14

but let me explain why, but then, even if you

15

disagree why -- what you could do about it, all

16

right?

17

I don't think there is a problem

18

because this Court has already -- although the

19

person may wake up and say, gee, I'm in a

20

reservation now, in fact, this Court's cases

21

have already limited tribal authority over

22

non-members on fee land within a reservation.

23

That is the point of the whole Plains

24

Commerce line of cases.

So although the person

25

may wake up and say, oh, I'm in a reservation,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

the answer is your life doesn't change all that

2

much.

3

But if Your Honor disagreed with that,

4

what this Court did in Justice Thomas's opinion

5

in Parker was say we separate the -- the

6

equitable and remedy -- remedial issues such as

7

are at issue -- Your Honor's question go to.

8

We separate those and deal with that through a

9

separate doctrine called City of Sherrill.

10

And the Court, of course, has that at

11

its disposal, and the Court could in an

12

appropriate case or if there was a -- an effort

13

to exercise authority, the Court could decide

14

whether that was a problem.

15

So I don't think that the kind of

16

seismic change that -- that Ms. Blatt

17

identifies or that Mr. Kneedler alludes to

18

would exist.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, just to

20

pause -- just to pause for a moment, you say

21

it's not going to be any difference when you

22

wake up.

23

allow the type of business in which you're

24

engaged, such as alcoholic beverages?

25

What if the tribe decides not to

20

yes, there would be additional regulation of a

member on fee land, but that is -- but the

land?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So I don't think

2

that that's part of -- part of the -- I don't

3

think that is part of the tribe's regulatory

authority.

5

is that this Court addressed this -­

6

But the bigger point, Your Honor,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess

7

just to be -- I don't mean to -- I'm trying to

8

find -- could -- could the tribe require those

9

non-members doing business with members on

10

Indian land to obtain a license to do that?

11

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

don't think the answer to that is yes.

think so.

principle of law that derives from Sherlock

how can it be that none of this was recognized

by anybody or asserted by the Creek Nation, as

23

far as I'm aware, for 100 years?

24
25

MR. GERSHENGORN:

And

So, Your Honor, I -­

I don't think that's accurate for a number of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

reasons.

First of all, for the last 40 years

2

-- when the Creek Nation adopted a constitution

3

in 1979, they asserted political jurisdiction

4

to the extent of their 1900 boundaries.

5

the Secretary approved that constitution.

6

this is not like the situation in Parker where

7

the tribe was absent for 130 years.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. GERSHENGORN:

10

And
So

But I mean as a -­
The place where

you -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- as a practical

12

matter, have they at any time prior to this

13

case attempted to do -- to assert any of the

14

sovereignty that you now claim they possess -­

15

MR. GERSHENGORN:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

-- under this vast

territory?

18
19

So the -­

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So the answer is

yes.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. GERSHENGORN:

And where?
And so I'll give you

22

an example.

So the tribe currently is engaged

23

in -- the tribe currently, pursuant -- pursuant

24

to cross-deputization agreements throughout the

25

historic boundaries, the 11-county area,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

exercises arrest authority over Indians and

2

non-Indians alike.

3

because they have entered into agreements that

4

are premised on the assertion of jurisdiction

5

throughout the land.

6

The reason they do that is

In fact, if you were in a car accident

7

at -- in fee land within the historic

boundaries, you would be driving -- you might

be driving on roads owned and paved by the

10

No, I -- this is not

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

We have a lot of

21

cases that say historical practice helps inform

the text, and we have these debates about the

the abolishment of tribal courts and -- and the

25

things we've discussed.

And I'm not sure I agree with you, given

But even if it were

ambiguous on the text, the historical practice

2

for a century has been against you.

departing from that and creating a great deal

-- you -- you referenced were in the 1901 Act.

8

It's the -- there's no doubt that the

9

reservation continued post-1901.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

11

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Right.
And so those things

12

you're talking about, the courts and others,

13

those happened, and yet the reservation

14

continued.

15

Now, with respect to courts in

16

particular, I -- I forget now which Justice

17

said it, but the -- maybe it was Justice Kagan

18

-- the elimination of particular powers, like

19

the power over the courts and things like that,

20

it's a misunderstanding, I think, of what it

21

takes to disestablish -- what -- what

22

sovereignty -- what reservations are getting at

23

here.

24
25

There's no particular sovereign power
that a tribe needed to have.

In fact, there -­

1

you could see a time, for example, if a state

2

overran tribal government where the federal

3

government would take over all three branches

4

of tribal government because the reservation is

5

a combination of tribal and federal authority

6

protecting against state hostility.

And so it's a mistake -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Does it matter

MR. GERSHENGORN:

I'm sorry, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But does that

13

take into account the significance of the fact

14

that the Creek received the land in fee rather

15

than in trust?

16

Because, once you say the reservation

17

doesn't matter, well, maybe it doesn't matter

18

if you -- in -- in a trust relationship, but if

19

you've already gotten a situation where it's

20

ownership direct, then maybe the significance

21

of what you can still actually do as -- as -­

22

not whether they -- what particular powers they

23

could exercise, but whether they could exercise

24

any powers, then the fact that you really don't

25

have a reservation to start with that is like

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

the significance of that distinction?

3

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So we think, Your

4

Honor, that that strengthens our position.

said it in the briefs.

6

it's crystal-clear there was a reservation to

start and the fee patent was an additional

boost.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

There is no doubt that the reason Congress did

19

-- the reason they broke up the communal land

20

ownership and broke up fee patents was to allow

21

sort of increased sale.

22

that.

there was a reservation ahead of time.

ON BEHALF OF MUSCOGEE (CREEK) NATION
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. KANJI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
If I may, I would like to address

20

three things:

21

consequences; second, to return to the question

22

of governmental powers; and, finally, to talk a

23

little bit about contemporary understanding.

24

With respect to consequences, there

25

first, this issue of

will not be turmoil from an affirmance.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

Creek Nation wishes to be very clear that

2

significant practical disruption would result

3

from disestablishment, not from retention of

4

the tribe's -- of the recognition of the

5

reservation.

6

It is true that Tulsa is not Pender,

7

but Tulsa is not different from Tacoma, the

8

City of Tacoma, much of which lies within the

9

Puyallup reservation, or from the millions of

10

other acres of land which this Court said in

11

Atkinson, non-Indian fee land, lie within

12

reservation boundaries.

13
14
15

There will not be turmoil because of
three reasons:
One, this Court's precedents restrict

16

tribal power over non-Indians on fee lands

17

within reservations.

18

we understand and respect.

19

Those are restraints that

Secondly, and conversely, the state

20

retains plenary authority over non-Indian fee

21

lands within reservation; plenary authority to

22

tax and -- and to regulate.

23

And, third -- and Oklahoma, the

24

history of Oklahoma is not exceptional, but

25

what is exceptional in Oklahoma is the extent

to which the State and the Nations have forged

cooperative agreements that already address

many of these issues.

MR. KANJI:

If -- an Indian, Your

Honor?

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. KANJI:

Yeah.

That -- well, that case

12

would end up either being prosecuted by the

13

federal government or by the Nation itself or

14

both concurrently.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

And how many

cases like that do you think there may be?

7

the Creek population is 43,000 within the

Yeah, but all the

Indians -- so this would apply as far as

11

criminal cases to all Indians, am I right?

12
13

MR. KANJI:

That's correct, Your

JUSTICE ALITO:

And how many would

that be?

16

MR. KANJI:

Well, about -- we don't

17

have exact numbers, but 50- to 60,000 Indians

18

within the reservation area.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if any of those

20

individuals was charged with any offense that

21

would normally be prosecuted in state court,

22

they would all have to be prosecuted in federal

23

court?

24
25

MR. KANJI:

Or by the Nation.

And I

think it's important to reinforce that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66

Nation has a robust criminal jurisdiction, has

robust courts, is already prosecuting many

Indians.

resolve them by statute or regulation.

I don't know how much trouble this causes.

25

You

And the reason there is a picture of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Tulsa in the brief, I thought, was to stimulate

2

me to ask such a question.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. KANJI:

Exactly.

Your Honor, I

5

think that the simplest answer is that an

6

affirmance will stimulate exactly that kind of

7

discussion and agreement.

8

The last time this Court had a case

9

from Oklahoma involving jurisdiction was the

10

Chickasaw Nation case in 1995.

11

ruled in favor of the Chickasaw Nation.

12

Shortly thereafter, fuel tax agreements were

13

forged in -- in the wake of that.

14

This Court

The same will -- will happen here.

15

There already are discussions taking place here

16

about the allocation of jurisdiction.

17

18

both criminal and civil jurisdiction.

You're talking

about discussions between Congress, the state,

23

MR. KANJI:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct, Your Honor.
And you think

that'll lead fairly quickly to an agreement

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

that will settle all these disputes?

2

MR. KANJI:

I think these -- I think

3

all sovereigns have an interest, a very common

4

shared interest, Your Honor, in law

5

enforcement.

6

The -- the brief of the Oklahoma

7

officials, I think, evidences that there is a

8

very close working relationship, in fact, on

9

the ground between the state, the local units

10

of government, and -- and the Nation.

11

will continue.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

That

Can there be such a

13

thing as a reservation that exists as an

14

abstract matter, but in this territory, the

15

Nation is able to exercise no sovereign powers

16

as a practical matter?

17

MR. KANJI:

Is that a possibility?

It is -- it is, Your

18

Honor.

19

when Congress takes any block of land, reserves

20

it from the public domain, reserves it from

21

sale, that creates the reservation.

22

A reservation, as Justice Kagan said,

Then, in order for that to be returned

23

to the public domain or to be disestablished,

24

Congress has to expressly indicate that intent.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if we don't agree

with you on that point, if we think this is a

practical inquiry, can you tell me what

8

sovereign powers the Nation retained within

9

this territory after statehood?

10

MR. KANJI:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

It retained legislative powers.

jurisdiction.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could -- could you say

13

a little bit more, Mr. Kanji, though, about the

14

converse proposition, that there, indeed, have

15

been reservations that everybody has understood

16

to be reservations historically throughout the

17

country, where tribal governments exercised

18

precious little authority?

19

MR. KANJI:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

20

And I'll give you a general and a specific

21

example.

22

Generally speaking, Congress has told

23

the tribes over time:

You -- your -- your

24

government will be structured in this fashion.

25

Your membership will consist of the following.

because, if the victim was Native American, the

That's

As -- as Footnote 5 in the Tenth

procedural bars in state court to lack of

subject matter jurisdiction.

14

any of these cases would re-traumatize the

15

victims, the families, and the communities.

16

Nor is it clear that the federal government

17

could retry any of these cases because the

evidence is too stale or the statute of

19

limitations has expired, which appears to be

20

the case in about half of them.

consequence on the civil side.
