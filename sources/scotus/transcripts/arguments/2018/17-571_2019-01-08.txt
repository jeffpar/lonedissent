(11:15 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument next this morning in Case 17-571,

5

Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation versus

6

Wall-Street.com.

7

Mr. Panner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The Copyright Act provides strong

13

textual evidence that the phrase "registration

14

has been made" in Section 411(a) refers to the

15

copyright owner's compliance with the

16

registration requirement of Section 408(a).

17

That reading is confirmed by the

18

legislative history, the statute overruled

19

cases that made the Register a gatekeeper to

20

the courthouse, and the policy of the statute,

21

which grants exclusive rights upon fixation of

22

an original work, not by virtue of any

23

administrative action.

24
25

And as a matter of ordinary language,
and in the Copyright Act's lexicon,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

registration can refer to the copyright owner's

2

effort to secure recordation of a claim and to

3

the Copyright Office's recordation of the claim

4

after examination.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but as

6

to that, it seems to me one reason the case is

7

a little confusing is that I think you're

8

right, registration could mean either.

9

a situation where you've got a registrar, it

But, in

10

seems to me that the most likely understanding

11

of "registration" is what that person does.

12

MR. PANNER:

But, Your Honor, that's

13

not the way the statute uses the language.

And

14

in Section 411(c), the -- Section 411(c)

15

expressly says the copyright owner makes

16

registration.

17

agreement that when it says "registration is

18

made," it's referring to the action of the

19

copyright owner.

20

to registration has been made in a context that

21

-- that necessarily refers to the action of the

22

copyright owner.

23

be made upon the filing of a single application

24

and fee.

25

registration for the work has been made within

In Section 412(2), there's

In Section 408(c), it refers

It says that registration may

And Section 405(a) refers to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

five years, which again strongly suggests that

2

it's by the copyright owner.

3

405(b), again, registration for the work has

4

been made under Section 408.

In Section

5

So there's no question, I think --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

7

forgot the second sentence of 411(a), which

8

speaks of registration cannot mean when the

9

applicant applies because it -- it talks about

10

the applicant being able to take action when

11

registration has been refused or, I would say,

12

when registration has not been made.

13

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

14

wouldn't say when registration has not been

15

made.

16

And that -- and that language is important.

17

And I think it's important to stress that our

18

position is that registration refers flexibly

19

to both but that the phrase "registration has

20

been made" consistently refers to the action of

21

the copyright owner, and it makes sense in

22

Section 411(a) itself.

23

It's when registration has been refused.

And if you look at the parallelism in

24

the structure, it talks about registration

25

having been made in accordance with the title,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

and then it says if the required deposit, fee,

2

and application have been delivered, so, again,

3

the action of the copyright owner, but

4

registration has been refused, i.e., the

5

registrar has taken an action that calls into

6

question whether the registration has been made

7

in accordance with the title, the case can

8

still proceed.

9
10

And so -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

dismiss 410(d) as superfluous?

12

MR. PANNER:

So you just

Not at all.

13

Section 410(d) provides that the effective date

14

of registration is when the -- the application,

15

fee and deposit have been received in a form

16

that is acceptable for registration as later

17

determined, and this is key, by the office or

18

by a court.

19

So Section 410(d), I think, strongly

20

supports our position because it makes clear

21

that in a case where there may be a doubt about

22

-- perhaps because the Register has not yet

23

acted, if there's some question about whether

24

registration has been made in accordance with

25

the title, the court can determine that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

question.

2

in a case in which the --

3

It can also determine that question

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you've

4

already said registration has been made in the

5

terms of the registrar's action when the -- the

6

applicant applies.

7

MR. PANNER:

Not -- not in -- to be

8

clear, Your Honor, "registration has been made"

9

in the statute refers to the copyright owner's

10

compliance with Section 408(a), which says that

11

registration may be obtained upon the

12

submission of the required application,

13

deposit, and fee.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you drive without

15

a driver's license when yours has expired

16

because you wrote in to the registry of motor

17

vehicles but they haven't yet licensed you?

18

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you change your

20

sewer in the house with a man who has not

21

gotten the approval from the local public

22

health authority under a statute that says you

23

have to have a registered -- you have to have a

24

-- an approved plumber because he wrote in and

25

asked for one?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

I mean, I can't think of examples --

2

I'm trying to -- where -- where -- where

3

there's something roughly comparable and the

4

statute is interpreted the way you want.

5

you've been able to think of some, which you

6

probably have.

7

MR. PANNER:

Maybe

Well, I think that, Your

8

Honor, there's a couple of cases, there's a

9

couple of statutes that were cited in the

10

amicus brief of the music publishers that refer

11

to the fact that registration is upon the --

12

that registration is made when the -- the --

13
14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

They say that

specifically?
MR. PANNER:

But, Your Honor, the

16

point here is that the text of the statute

17

likewise makes clear that registration is made

18

upon the submission of the materials.

19

gave the -- we gave the analogy to a -- a

20

college student who registers for a class.

21

would say that he has made his registration,

22

he's registered for the class, but,

23

nevertheless, the registrar might say the class

24

is full, you're not going to be admitted to it,

25

and now the registration has been refused.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And we

And this Court has repeatedly referred

2

to the fact that a copyright owner makes

3

registration in the case --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you registered

5

for the class when you've mailed it in, but the

6

professor hasn't gotten it?

7

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, this --

8

in this statute, it says that registration is

9

made if -- and this is in Section 410(d).

It

10

answers the question.

11

been received by the Copyright Office.

12

question about whether it's the mailbox rule or

13

received by the Copyright Office is actually

14

addressed in the statute.

15

the term "registration" has that flexibility

16

built into it.

17

It says when they've
So the

But, again, the --

And I think it's important to

18

understand the context in which Congress was

19

acting when it adopted Section 411(a) in 1976.

20

It was aware of the Vacheron decision, and it

21

was aware of Chief Judge Clark's dissent in

22

which he made this very point, which is that it

23

doesn't make sense to read "registration" as

24

requiring affirmative administrative action

25

when the rights that exist, the exclusive right

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

does not depend -- it's not like the Patent

2

Office.

3

administrative body has the authority to grant

4

exclusive rights and that the exclusive rights

5

don't exist until there's that action.

6

It's not a situation in which the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me

7

as a matter of fact when is the copyright

8

registration published?

9

MR. PANNER:

The copyright, under

10

current -- under the current procedure, the

11

copyright application becomes publicly

12

available when it's -- after it's granted.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so it seems

14

illogical to think that you're going to get

15

rights against the third-party who's not on

16

notice that your copyright has been registered

17

because it's not public.

18

MR. PANNER:

Right.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. PANNER:

I just want to -There's --

-- I want to address that

21

as strongly as I can.

It's just not right.

22

The -- the right to exclude exists by virtue of

23

the creation of an original work and its

24

fixation in a medium from which it can be

25

perceived.

That gives the author the right,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

the copyright owner the right to exclude.

2

There's no question about that.

3

nothing to do with notice.

4

required under the current statute.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Notice is not

But it is in terms

of -- well, that begs the question.

7

MR. PANNER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

That has

And on -But you can't --

you -- you --

10

MR. PANNER:

If I may.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- you can't

12

pursue a suit unless the registration is

13

accepted?

14

MR. PANNER:

But -- no.

No, Your

15

Honor.

Section 4 -- in fact, there's no

16

question that you can pursue a suit, whether or

17

not the registration is accepted.

18

Section 4 --

Under

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, you're right.

20

MR. PANNER:

So --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. PANNER:

Okay.

Because the --

And the other thing

23

that's -- that's important to understand, and

24

this is, I think, critical, the government

25

concedes that the enhanced statutory remedies

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

that are available for infringement after a

2

work has been registered are available if the

3

registration, the application, deposit, and fee

4

have been submitted.

5

registration, that is enough to satisfy 412(2).

If the applicant has made

6

And they say that that's true because

7

the effective date of registration is the date

8

on which those -- Section 408(a) has been

9

complied with.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's

11

enough assuming that the registrar has

12

registered the mark.

13

whether you go back to start counting the

14

damages.

It's just a question of

15

MR. PANNER:

16

not have to register the mark.

17

not the mark, the copyright.

18

Again, the registrar does

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the --

Well, you're

19

not entitled to the special benefits under the

20

Act until the registrar has, right?

21

MR. PANNER:

No.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It just goes

23

-- it goes back -- in terms of when you start

24

calculating it, it may go back.

25

MR. PANNER:

No, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Section

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

410 --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you could

3

go back, the registrar hasn't even registered

4

the mark, and you can go into court and say,

5

hey, I get the benefits of having registered my

6

mark?

7

MR. PANNER:

The copyright claim, yes,

8

Your Honor.

That's what Section 410(d) says.

9

Section 410(d) says the effective date of

10

registration is the date on which the required

11

application, deposit, and fee have been

12

received in a form acceptable for registration.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but

14

maybe I'm just missing the point, or one of us.

15

I mean, you have to at least had it registered,

16

accepted by the registrar.

17

you know that you're entitled to those

18

benefits?

19

MR. PANNER:

Otherwise, how do

Your Honor, because the

20

question of registrability can be determined by

21

a court in that litigation.

22

Section 410(d) says.

23

That's what

And, again, in the vast majority, as a

24

practical matter, in the vast majority of

25

cases, registration is -- is essentially a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

ministerial question of submission of the

2

application, deposit, and fee.

3

Think about if you have a magazine

4

article or a book or a piece of music, you

5

know, a piece of sheet music that is being

6

registered.

7

are registered as a matter of course.

8
9

Those things are submitted.

They

Under the -- under current procedures,
it can take many months, but it's going to be

10

registered as a matter of course.

11

the right to exclude -- everybody agrees, Your

12

Honor, that when those materials are submitted

13

in a form acceptable for registration, that is

14

the effective date of registration, even if the

15

registrar acts a year later.

16

And so precisely --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18
19

And, again,

Well, that's

just 410(d) that says that?
MR. PANNER:

And -- but everybody

20

agrees that that's what 412(2), which refers to

21

-- which preserves certain statutory remedies,

22

if registration is made within three months

23

after publication, that's -- everyone agrees

24

that that's what 412(2) means as well.

25

clearly what Section 411(c), which, for what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

it's worth, was adopted as Section 411(b)

2

immediately after 411(a), everybody agrees that

3

-- I -- I shouldn't say the Respondent agrees

4

with that.

5

The government agrees that that's what

6

Section 411(c) means.

And so I do think that

7

what -- that when you're thinking about what

8

has to happen, the Copyright Office is not the

9

Patent Office.

It does not grant exclusive

10

rights that don't exist before the Copyright

11

Office acts.

12

The exclusive rights exist.

There is

13

a requirement to register.

14

has to register before suing.

15

requirement, and the statute doesn't say, that

16

the Copyright Office has to act first.

17

The copyright owner
But there's no

And there's no reason that it should.

18

It's a -- again, the right to exclude in the

19

statute is built around the fact that an author

20

has fixed an expression in a tangible medium.

21

And once they have submitted the

22

required application, deposit, and fee under

23

Section 408(a), they have registered.

24

have taken care of that procedural hurdle so

25

that they can then bring their lawsuit and get

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

relief.

2

Now, in many cases, the Copyright

3

Office may grant the registration while that is

4

pending, and -- but, in any event, if there's a

5

question about that, it can be dealt with.

6

As a practical matter, that's almost

7

never going to happen, and that's very

8

important to recognize, is that if the Court

9

rules -- if the Court affirms the Eleventh

10

Circuit, it will create major problems for

11

copyright owners.

12

community has unanimously come in to say that

13

this Court should --

14
15

That's why the copyright

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Mr. Panner,

describe --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Panner, I -- I --

17

I understand some of the policy arguments that

18

you have on your side, but, I mean, the

19

question is whether the text can -- can -- can

20

be looked at that way.

21

And I'll just go back to where the

22

Chief Justice started, which is this passage in

23

411(a).

24

the first sentence is registration has been

25

made, and the second sentence is registration

And you have these two sentences, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

has been refused, and they're connected by a

2

"however."

3

So, you know, to me, you have these

4

two sentences, they're in total proximity.

5

They're both framed in the passive voice.

6

"Registration has been refused" is clearly

7

registration has been refused by the Register,

8

not by the holder.

9

And so it seems, you know, the only

10

way to read this is that the "registration has

11

been made" is by the Register too.

12

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor,

13

obviously, we don't agree with that.

14

and let me try to say why I think, again,

15

getting back to the textual evidence from the

16

statute, the -- the issue is not granted or

17

refused, and -- the issue is whether

18

registration is made by the copyright owner.

19

And --

And the -- the text uses the phrase to

20

mean that all the time, including in the

21

immediate succeeding --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -- well, I'm kind

23

of with you that the word "register" has some

24

flexibility to it.

25

convinced me of that.

So you've got -- you've

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

The question is whether it has

2

flexibility to it in 411(a).

3

the -- the juxtaposition between the first

4

sentence and the second sentence, the identical

5

grammar, the way they're connected with the

6

"however," it would just seem extremely strange

7

to change the person who's the subject of this

8

action.

9

MR. PANNER:

And -- and given

I -- I -- I don't think

10

so, Your Honor.

And -- and -- and let me --

11

and bear with me.

12

of the sentence, the first sentence says if --

13

registration has been made in accordance with

14

this title.

15

phraseology, the "registration has been made"

16

construction is used all the time to refer to

17

what the copyright owner does.

If you look at the structure

And as we've shown, that

18

The next sentence says:

19

deposit, application, and fee required for

20

registration have been delivered."

21

action of the copyright owner.

22

parallel to the beginning of that first

23

sentence.

24
25

"Where the

Again, the

So that is

Then the second -- the second piece of
it says "in accordance with the title."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

this one then says "in the proper form and

2

registration has been refused."

3

distinguishing a situation where registration

4

has been made and it is or going to be granted

5

because the Register agrees.

6

So this is

But this is a situation in which the

7

-- the registrar, notwithstanding the

8

compliance with Section 408(a), has refused it.

9

And that -- so -- so the -- the

10

reference to the registration has been refused

11

corresponds to the question of -- is intended

12

to clarify the question of what happens if

13

there's a dispute because the Register has --

14

has -- has refused the application, refused to

15

register the claim, about whether it's in

16

accordance with this title.

17

And so -- and if you look at the --

18

the -- the language, if you look at the

19

context, and if you think about what Congress

20

was attempting to -- was dealing with in terms

21

of the litigation rights, it makes no sense to

22

read the first sentence as suggesting that

23

Congress wanted to recreate the very result

24

that it sought to overrule in Vacheron.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And you -- you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

alluded to major problems and then didn't

2

describe them.

3

create enough doubt about the statutory

4

language to suggest we shouldn't stick with the

5

What -- can you describe what those
are?
MR. PANNER:

Sure.

And I think that

12

the amici speak to this, is that the -- the

13

most significant problem is that when there is

14

-- when there is infringement that begins and

15

the claim has not yet been registered, that the

16

copyright owner cannot bring any civil action,

17

including an action for injunctive relief,

18

until the Copyright Office has acted, and under

19

the -- under the view of the Respondent and the

20

government, until the Copyright Office has

21

either granted or refused registration.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

What

23

happens in a case where you do bring -- and I'm

24

going to ask the government about the

25

pre-registration intent which permits a --

What does a court do?

that the registration hasn't been made.

There's an injunctive suit before that.

copyright?

25

And why would that be?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. PANNER:

Well, for many -- in many

2

cases, it may be impossible to identify who has

-- who has done all of the subsequent --

4

subsequent distribution.

5

point is that Congress authorized injunctive

6

remedies precisely because it may often be

difficult to determine what the damages are.

8

And it does not -- it does not make

9

sense, once the copyright owner has complied

with the registration obligation under

copyright owner from pursuing the remedy.

long are the delays now?

18

And how does that

The -- my understanding

19

is that, for electronic submissions, the

20

average is seven months, and for paper, it's

21

nine.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

you can pay extra for first class, right?

MR. PANNER:

consideration, but, first of all, the Copyright

2

Office is under no obligation to grant that.

3

Second of all, even in those circumstances, it

4

can take many weeks, even months, to resolve

5

the application.

6

especially in -- you know, under current

7

circumstances for a work to be essentially

MR. PANNER:

They appear to have been

14

significantly shorter, Your Honor.

15

see -- I couldn't determine exactly what they

16

were in terms of -- of averages, but they were

17

-- they were significantly shorter.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I didn't

Yeah, I mean,

19

significantly shorter but still a matter of

20

weeks and months?

21

MR. PANNER:

I think a matter of weeks

22

in -- in any event.

But there was -- there was

23

some suggestion that at an earlier time it was

24

-- it was quite fast.

25

which is back in the '30s, but I happened to

The Washingtonian case,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

notice that in that one, the application -- the

2

case was -- was evidently filed after a

3

certificate had been granted, and that was two

4

weeks after the application was submitted.

5

So it may be that -- you know, but --

6

but what's interesting is, in Chief Judge

7

Clark's dissent in Vacheron, he does talk about

8

the fact that delay could lead to the loss of

9

substantive rights and that that doesn't make

10

any sense.

11

I do think that Congress was

12

influenced by that dissent or I think it's --

13

it makes sense to read Congress's enactment as

14

being consistent with the views expressed in

15

that dissent, which indicate that once the

16

copyright owner has complied with the

17

obligations under Section 408(a), it does not

make sense to prevent the copyright owner from

pursuing a remedy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

Section 411 of the Copyright Act

6

provides that no civil infringement suit shall

7

be instituted until registration has been made

8

or registration has been refused.

9

The statutory text is plain.

10

Register of Copyrights must make a registration

11

determination before an applicant can sue for

12

infringement.

13

The

And I'd like to start with the

14

operative sentence of Section 411(a).

This is

15

on page 30a of the petition appendix.

And that

16

sentence prohibits suit "until pre-

17

registration or registration of the copyright

18

claim has been made in accordance with this

19

title."

20

So the natural question is, where in

21

this title do we look?

The immediately

22

preceding provision in the title happens to be

23

called Registration of Claim.

24

Section 410.

25

appendix.

This is

It's on page 29a of the petition

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

The (a) subsection says that after the

2

Register examines the claim, if the criteria is

3

met, "the Register shall register the claim."

4

And the (b) section says that if the Register

5

determines the criteria is not met, "the

6

Register shall refuse registration."

7
8

So, in either case, it's patently
obvious that it is the Register who is acting.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I

10

mean, your friend on the other side makes the

11

point -- and I think there's a lot to it --

12

that there are a lot of other sections and

13

provisions where it only makes sense to read

14

"register" as if you were registering for, you

15

know, for the draft or something.

16
17

MR. STRIS:

So a few responses, Mr.

Chief Justice.

18

The first is I'm happy to do a close

19

reading of any of the provisions that my friend

20

cites.

21

stand for the proposition that an application

22

alone is enough.

23

Section 411(a) is surely not one of them.

24

is kind of the -- the point you made earlier,

25

Justice Kagan.

We don't actually think any of them

But even if some did,
This

We -- we look to how it's used

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

in 411(a).

2

I don't deny that the word

3

"registration," "make registration," in some

4

context could refer to something different, but

5

my friend's core -- core proposition in this

6

case is that there's something special about

7

the use of "made" or the -- or the passive

8

construct.

9

disagree with.

10

And that's fundamentally what we

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about 410(d)?

11

In 410(d), it says the effective date of a

12

copyright registration is the day on which an

13

application, deposit, and fee, which are later

14

determined to be registered, have all been

15

received by the Copyright Office.

16
17
18

So maybe the registration is when it's
received, if there's later approval.
MR. STRIS:

So, Justice Breyer, let me

19

give a textual response and then a more

20

fundamental one.

21

My textual response is that the

22

effective date provision requires a

23

determination by someone.

24

Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

25

you were getting at earlier.

This is what the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

If you look at the text of 410(d), it

2

says after the Register or a court of competent

3

jurisdiction has determined that the criteria

4

is satisfied, then you get the effective date.

5

411(a), Justice Breyer, is a precondition to

6

suit.

7
8
9

No one disputes that.
And at the time of filing, no one,

neither the -JUSTICE BREYER:

It says registration.

10

But, you see, if you look at 410(d), I guess in

11

English, if you ever read like property law,

12

there's such a thing as having a piece of

13

property subject to defeasance.

14

And so noting that, and it is a piece

15

of property, you could read 410(d) as saying

16

the effective date of copyright registration,

17

i.e., you have it, is the date on which all

18

those things are received, though they are

19

subject to later defeasance if, in fact, the

20

registrar disapproves.

21
22
23

Okay.

That's consistent with the

language, I think.
MR. STRIS:

Is it?
I don't think so.

So I'm

24

going to continue with the textual point, but I

25

-- and I do want to get to the more fundamental

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

one.

2

consistent with the language is 411(a) says

3

that you can't do anything until registration

4

is made.

5

The reason why I don't think it's

Now I understand you're trying to have

6

410(d) do the work, and I think probably the

7

best phrase in that for my friend is the

8

inclusion of a court of competent jurisdiction.

9

But it's clear that a court of competent

10

jurisdiction is in there because the court can

11

act when the Register has refused the

12

registration.

13

And, in fact, for those who have a

14

particular view of legislative history, if you

15

look at the House Report, it specifically says

16

that.

17

possibility that a court might later find the

18

Register wrong in refusing registration."

19

It says that 410(d) "also recognizes the

So I think the text doesn't -- it

20

would do great violence to the text to

21

interpret it that way.

22

want to make the more fundamental point because

23

this addresses some of the policy issues, kind

24

of the elephant in the room.

25

But, Justice Breyer, I

The whole point of a registration

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

decision, whether it's a grant or a refusal, we

2

submit, is a belief that there is value to the

3

registration process itself.

4

In some ways, it's analogous to

5

administrative exhaustion requirements that we

6

find in a number of statutes.

7

at copyrights specifically, 30 percent of all

8

copyright registration applications result in

9

correspondence.

10

So, if you look

And this is essential because,

11

occasionally, it's correspondence like in this

12

case where you get a letter saying your check

13

bounced, please pay the money.

14

often, the correspondence is the -- the agency

15

saying, well, we looked at your application, we

16

need you to change things.

17

limit your claim.

18

But far more

We need you to

It's an interactive process.

And so my friend wants to focus

19

entirely on the fact that most of the

20

applications are ultimately granted.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, not just most.

22

Ninety-seven percent, right?

23

MR. STRIS:

Well, so I think it may be

24

even more than that.

But I want to press --

25

before I get to that, I want to press this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

point.

2

after changes have been made by the applicants

3

because of the interact --

4
5

Many of those applications are granted

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How often does that

happen?

6

MR. STRIS:

I don't know as -- as a

7

percentage, but I can tell you not a de minimis

8

-- de minimis amount, a significant number of

9

times.

And so you may not like this policy,

10

but what I'm trying to do is not argue as a

11

policy matter that I'm right.

12

I'm trying to explain why there's no

13

-- you shouldn't have any heartburn holding

14

that Congress meant what it clearly said in the

15

provision because one could certainly believe

16

that it's more efficient.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, maybe the

18

bigger heartburn, if we have any, about the

19

policy here is that if I'm persuaded of one

20

thing, it's that Congress pretty much assumed

21

that registration decisions would happen

22

promptly when it enacted the statute and that

23

there's at least some evidence that that --

24

that that hope or expectation has not exactly

25

materialized.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

And -- and I take that to be the

2

underlying plea from the other side really.

3

What do you say to that?

4
5

MR. STRIS:

So I would say a few

things.

6

First, I would say that, to be

7

perfectly frank, this is largely a solution in

8

search of a problem.

9

injunctive issue first and then -- and then

10

And I want to address the

come back to damages.

11

With regard to injunctions, I don't

12

think it's -- I don't think I can overstate the

13

point that this argument has been made to

14

Congress repeatedly, and Congress has added two

15

critical exceptions where the need for an ex

16

parte TRO is most acute.

17

the live broadcast exception in 411(c), and I'm

18

talking about pre-registration in 408(f).

19

And I'm talking about

And so, in the mine-run of cases where

20

there's an issue with regard to needing an

21

injunction quickly, those address the problem.

22

It --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But your solution

24

undermines that solution.

Your -- your

25

proposed reading means that the people who are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

pre-registering are not getting the benefit of

2

it until the registrar acts.

3

MR. STRIS:

No, no, that's -- Justice

4

Sotomayor, that's -- Sotomayor, that's a very

5

important point.

6

Of course.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the way

17

MR. STRIS:

category of works that have historically been

So, if you're HBO and you have Game of

2

lot of people, the -- the -- the people on the

access to the materials, you have a streamlined

all you have to do is explain that it fits

8

9

You can sue immediately.

You get

You can get

10

an injunction.

And this is critical.

If you

11

look at 408(f)(3), Congress said you then must

12

submit an application, deposit, and fee within

13

three months of your first commercialization.

14

So it just goes to show that Congress

15

knew how to make clear that they wanted to peg

16

something to an application.

19

Now, Justice Gorsuch, back to my
solution in search of a problem.
So the first answer is I think there

20

are these two critical exceptions that deal

21

with the problem quite well.

22

My second answer is that in the rare

23

case -- and I think, frankly, it is rare --

24

where you would have the imminence and

25

irreparable injury that would warrant a TRO,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and you don't fall within one of those

2

exceptions, you can apply for special handling.

3

And I understand that special handling

4

was not required.

5

office decided to offer.

6

matter, the reality is it is offered, and the

7

office does everything it can to resolve issues

8

within five days.

9

It's something that the
But, as a practical

And, obviously, you can ask my -- my

10

-- my friend from the government about -- more

11

detail about how it works, but my understanding

12

is that they honor that and that particularly,

13

if you notify the government that there's

14

litigation, there's no reason to believe that

15

you don't get a determination within a certain

16

number of days.

17

So I -- I really think it's not an

18

issue.

And then I would conclude by saying to

19

the extent that some hypothetical copyright

20

plaintiff with a pending application can't get

21

a TRO for -- it doesn't fit within one of those

22

two things -- our core submission is that

23

that's a cost that Congress thought was worth

24

the benefits of the specific rule that they

25

chose.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

Now, with regard to damages, just a

2

few words on this.

3

in Section 507(b), it's a three-year rolling

4

statute that runs from discovery of

5

infringement.

6

The statute of limitations

Now I think it was Justice Kagan who

7

asked a question about the processing times.

8

As of now, according to the Copyright Office

9

website, the average processing time for all

10

claims is seven months.

11

all applications right now are resolved within

12

two to 15 months.

13

Ninety-four percent of

So I think the most telling answer as

14

a practical matter that I would give is that

15

it's not surprising that the Petitioner does

16

not identify a single case where the statute of

17

limitations has somehow expired while an

18

applicant --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it

20

doesn't -- well, as you said, it's a rolling

21

statute administration.

22

expiring doesn't really fit.

23

So the idea of it

And the argument, I guess, on the

24

other side is that seven months doesn't mean

25

that much if it's the first two weeks where all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

the damage is done because somebody puts it

2

online and then everybody, you know, has the

3

benefit of it, and it's very hard to go back

4

and undo that.

5

MR. STRIS:

So two responses.

6

So, with regard to irreparable injury,

7

I think that's what injunctions are for, and I

8

feel like I addressed that a bit earlier.

9

With regard to damages and your point

10

which I take that it's rolling, and there are

11

separate accruals, and we're not just talking

12

about whether you lose your entire claim but

13

whether you lose some of the damages, I'm

14

making a much stronger point.

15

I'm saying Petitioner doesn't cite a

16

single case where some chunk of the damages

17

fell outside of the three-year window because

18

the applicant was waiting.

19

The only --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't

21

know, you know, whether he cites a particular

22

case or not, but as a matter of logic, it makes

23

sense, doesn't it?

24
25

MR. STRIS:

I don't think so.

And --

and let me -- let me kind of walk through why I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

don't think it makes sense.

2

So you have three years from

3

discovery, three years from, oh, okay, I see

4

that there's an infringement, I have three

5

years to wait.

6

you immediately file your application.

7

years, you need.

8
9

If you're not being dilatory,
Three

If the average processing time is
seven months, and if 94 percent of applications

10

are being resolved within 15 months, then on

11

the -- on the outside, you're talking about a

12

tiny percentage of situations that even come

13

close.

14

mail applications, which the office

15

discourages, that involve correspondence.

16

If you look at those, they tend to be

Where the -- if -- if there's any way

17

to get from 15 months to three years, it's

18

overwhelmingly likely that it's because of

19

dilatory behavior on the part of the applicant,

20

and let me give you a warrant for that.

21

The only case that we have ever seen

22

where this has been an issue was found by the

23

American Bar Association, an amici to -- to my

24

friend, who cites a 25-year-old case called

25

Kregos from the Southern District of New York.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

Well, the court described the problem as

2

"self-induced" because, in fact, the plaintiff

3

sat on his hands.

4

So I can't come here and tell you that

5

there's never been a situation where this has

6

been an issue, but I think the fact that, you

7

know, my friend and a host of amici haven't

8

been -- been able to unearth one of them is

9

probably strong --

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What --

11

MR. STRIS: -- indication that this is

12

not that serious a problem.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

good argument on the text, obviously.

15

you're also trying to say there's no real

16

problem here, a solution in search of a

17

problem.

18

amici say things like the rule adopted here

19

would have a devastating impact and would cause

20

severe hardship.

21

representatives.

22

You have a -- a
But

I'm just questioning that, given the

And these are the industry

Again, you could win on the text, but

23

the idea that there's no problem seems a

24

stretch to me.

25

MR. STRIS:

Well, so, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

Kavanaugh, let me address that head on.

2

So I -- I will concede that, for

3

decades, there's been vigorous disagreement

4

over whether and to what extent formalities

5

should be removed from the Copyright Act.

6

many stakeholders, including several of

7

Petitioner's amici, have long been

8

dissatisfied.

9
10
11
12

They prefer --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Right.

There's a

problem.
MR. STRIS:

But -- but -- so let me --

let me finish.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

MR. STRIS:

Okay.

There are many people who

15

subscribe to that view.

16

characterize it as a problem is kind of a

17

normative judgment.

18

who subscribe to the alternative view.

19

happen to be among them.

20

be among them.

21

And

Whether you

There are also many people
We

Our amici happen to

So I would resist the -- the -- the

22

characterization of your question and say that

23

the -- the -- there's not ambiguity in the

24

statute but, rather, a profound dissatisfaction

25

on the part of some stakeholders.

And the way

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

we address that is we look at the text and we

2

try and determine what it indicates Congress

3

decided.

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

5

MR. STRIS:

Okay.

And on this one, I don't

6

think just we have an okay argument on the

7

text; I think that it's overwhelmingly the case

8

that you -- you have to interpret it to mean a

9

registration decision.

10

So, going back to the text just for --

11

for a moment, I've only talked about the first

12

sentence, which I think --

13
14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Before we leave that

subject, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry to interrupt --

15

MR. STRIS:

Please.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- but what do you

17

say to the objection that it puts American

18

copyright holders at a disadvantage because

19

formalities aren't required under our

20

international obligations?

21

MR. STRIS:

So what -- Justice

22

Gorsuch, what you just asked was the core

23

debate, and it was a vigorous one in 1988 when

24

the House and the Senate split in determining

25

how to deal with Berne.

One said, okay, we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

should get rid of the registration requirement

2

entirely; the other said no, it's fine, keep it

3

the way it is.

4

they added the words "U.S. works."

5

They reached a compromise, and

So, again, I -- I certainly don't want

6

to suggest that the policy arguments for the

7

alternative are terrible.

8

defended.

9

that they're right.

They could be

Many people in this room may think
But they're beside the

10

point when the case is about what Congress

11

meant in enacting this particular statutory

12

language.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You -- you made an

14

analogy to exhaustion of administrative

15

remedies.

I just want to test that --

16

MR. STRIS:

Uh-huh.

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- analogy.

Is

18

that really what's going on here?

19

resolving it going to eliminate the need for a

20

suit --

21

MR. STRIS:

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

23

MR. STRIS:

24

"analogy" on purpose.

25

same.

Is this --

So I think it's -- I --- in many cases?

-- I used the word
It's not exactly the

But there are some striking --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

2

it even within the ZIP code?

3

MR. STRIS:

4

Well, is it -- is

Oh, definitely.

Definitely.

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

6

MR. STRIS:

Okay, how?

I think there are striking

7

similarities.

So the first is, although as a

8

percentage most claims, 97 percent, 99 percent,

9

ultimately get registered, last year there were

10

18,000 refusals, and that doesn't take into

11

account the tens of thousands of applications

12

that were abandoned or withdrawn in the

13

process.

14

So it may be a small percentage, but

15

there are still tens of thousands of instances

16

where you would have different incentives and

17

different conduct based upon the rule that you

18

pick.

19

That's number one.
Number two, even for the claims that

20

are granted, you can't sweep away the fact that

21

there is interaction between the applicant and

22

the office.

23

sue immediately or whether you require that

24

they go through the examination process

25

irrespective of the result clearly is similar

And so whether you allow people to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

to an exhaustion regime and that you think that

2

there's something beneficial about the process.

3

And then my final answer is I think

4

perhaps the most important one, which is the

5

reason it's a loose analogue, the reason why

6

it's in the same ballpark, is it may not be

7

like ERISA, for example, where the point of the

8

administrative process is to see if you can

9

resolve this -- the dispute beforehand.

But it

10

-- but it is similar in the sense that you

11

believe that a completion of the process has

12

value.

13

And I think the authors' and

14

educators' amicus brief does a great job of

15

describing that requiring that people go

16

through the process enhances copyright value.

17

It creates a public registry of correspondence

18

-- publicly available information about the

19

correspondence.

20

that are being registered are the best claims

21

possible.

22

earlier and register claims or, rather, apply

23

to register claims not just when there's

24

infringement but get works into the Library of

25

Congress and into the registry because they

It ensures that the claims

It has the incentive that people act

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

think, well, I want to get ahead of the game

2

and be in a position where I can vindicate my

3

rights.

4

That's not exactly the same as an

5

administrative exhaustion requirement before

6

litigation, but there -- it's certainly in the

7

same ZIP code.

8

very strong parallels.

There's a number of, I think,

9

So I guess the final thing that I

10

would say is that I've only talked briefly

11

about the first sentence.

12

the second sentence of Section 411(a), I think

13

it -- it -- it really kind of seals the deal

14

because that sentence is naturally read as an

15

exception to the first.

But, if you turn to

16

And in order to avoid that reading, my

17

friend is forced to argue that exactly the same

18

phrase, "registration has been," means two

19

completely different things in the first and

20

the second sentence.

21

And kind of in the interest of kind of

22

not burying the lead, what I would say about

23

this is that the -- the problem -- if I could

24

just finish that thought?

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MR. STRIS:

The problem with what my

2

friend does infects many of his arguments,

3

which is he interprets the provision in a way

4

that's not literally impossible but renders

5

many provisions insignificant:

6

the constructive notice provisions.

7

doesn't make sense to do that, and so we ask

8

that you affirm.

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I'd like to pick up right where my

19

friend left off on the second sentence of

20

Section 411(a) because I do think that that is

21

really the key to this case, and I think there

22

are three pretty -- three textual cues in that

23

sentence that show that registration has been

24

made, and the first sentence must be referring

25

to the act of the Register.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

The first is the one we just talked

2

about, that it uses the word "registration."

3

And I think it's actually a little bit stronger

4

than what we've said.

5

been refused.

6

the final act of registration.

7

-- that's what has been refused in that -- in

8

that scenario.

9

It says registration has

That obviously is talking about
That's the only

So it's pretty strange to think that

10

"registration," that word in the first

11

sentence, doesn't mean the same thing and the

12

only person who can make registration in that

13

sense is the Register of Copyrights.

14

The second thing to notice is that the

15

second sentence says that when you -- refers to

16

delivering to the Copyright Office your

17

deposit, application, and fee in proper form.

18

You might recognize that sentence.

19

my friend says "registration has been made"

20

means in the first.

21

Congress to refer to the exact same conduct in

22

two consecutive sentences and not use a phrase

23

that even resembles each other.

24
25

That's what

Again, pretty peculiar for

And the third thing is what my friend
says -- has already raised, that the whole

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53

point of the second sentence is to create an

2

exception to the registration requirement in

3

the first.

4

the registration requirement when the Register

5

has refused registration.

6

was submit your application in proper form,

7

what the Register does, inherently is the

8

assumption in that sentence, doesn't change

9

that you've properly applied.

And you don't need an exception to

If all you had to do

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well --

-- I believe -Go ahead.

I believe Mr. Panner

15

says that the function of the second sentence

16

is to require an additional act, that notice be

17

given to the Register.

18

MR. ELLIS:

Right, and I think there

19

are two problems with that reading, aside from

20

the fact it's just not the most natural one.

21

The first is that -- I think what he

22

said this morning is that you can -- the case

23

can still proceed when -- after the Register

24

refuses registration.

25

But that's not what it says.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It says

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

you're entitled to institute your suit.

2

assumes that nothing happens until the Register

3

has acted.

4

problem with the second sentence is that it

5

undermines the third sentence of 411(a), which

6

gives the Register a right to intervene in

7

suits and where she has refused registration

8

upon notice within 60 days.

9

That makes sense.

So it

The other

And if a suit can be filed before the

10

Register gets a chance to evaluate the

11

application and come to a decision and then get

12

notice of -- of this suit, then the suit can

13

get pretty far down the road before the

14

Register can intervene.

15

undermines the scheme and is clearly not what

16

Congress intended.

17

And I think that

The -- the Petitioner talks about --

18

points to obviously a bunch of different

19

provisions in the Act and he says, well,

20

registration has been made or some variant of

21

that, and these other provisions must mean the

22

copyright owner's actions.

23
24
25

We disagree, but we don't think the
Court has to go that far.
I think it's clear, and he agrees,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

that it doesn't always mean that in the Act.

2

Section 708(a) refers to -- says that the fees

3

you pay for an application have to cover the

4

cost of the application, including the issuance

5

of a certificate if registration is made.

6

Well, the issue -- a certificate is

7

only issued if registration is made by the

8

register.

9

In the constructive notice provisions

10

in Section 60 -- or, excuse me, 205 and in 406,

11

I think those are also places where he

12

disagrees, but I don't think there's any

13

reasonable reading of those provisions that --

14

that -- where -- that can come to the

15

conclusion that registration has been made

16

there or a variant thereof.

17

It doesn't refer to the Register of

18

Copyrights Act.

And if I could maybe walk

19

through why that is, I think it's important.

20

205, Section 205 is about recording

21

documents that relate to a copyrighted work.

22

So think about a transfer of ownership.

23

says you can record the document and, once you

24

do, the world is on notice of the facts stated

25

therein, with two conditions:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And it

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

The first is that that document

2

contain enough information such that a search

3

in the Copyright Office's records by

4

registration number or by title reveals the

5

document.

6

been made.

7

The second is that registration has

And I think the -- the obvious

8

implication there is that that too is going to

9

create a public record of when -- of the work

10

and of the registration of the work.

11

that's not true of an application.

And

12

And so it's true that -- that the

13

right attaches right away, but as you were

14

talking about before, Justice Sotomayor, there

15

are circumstances where notice is critically

16

important.

17

Petitioner -- and Petitioner's reading would --

18

would make a hash of that provision.

This is one of them.

And

19

Section 406 is a similar one.

And

20

what it says, if there's an error in the notice

21

on a copyrighted work, so, you know, it says

22

your circle (C) and then it says John.

23

John's not the owner.

24

is.

25

copyright.

Well,

It turns out that Jack

That says -- that doesn't invalidate your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

But what it does do is preside --

2

excuse me, provide an infringer, an innocent

3

infringer with a complete defense to

4

infringement if -- if -- if he went out and got

5

a license from John, the person who is named in

6

that notice.

7

But, critically, you can't rely on

8

that defense.

The innocent infringer defense

9

doesn't work if registration had been made in

10

the correct owner's name at the time of

11

infringement.

12

Again, that makes no sense unless

13

registration having been made creates a public

14

record of the work and the proper owner.

15

So I think what that establishes is

16

that it cannot mean everywhere it shows up to

17

refer to the act of the copyright owner.

18

so it just points us right back to

19

Section 411(a) and the first two sentences,

20

which we think cannot be read any other way.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And

The textual

22

argument you make is, of course, weighty.

23

think they're trying to say that there are --

24

it doesn't make sense in terms of, A, what

25

Congress would have been thinking or, B -- and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

B, how things operate in the real world and the

2

problems that would be created.

3

So can you respond to those?

4

MR. ELLIS:

I'd love to address both.

5

On -- on the first, I think, as to what

6

Congress could have thought, it may be hard --

7

harder to say, but, as we discussed, the relays

8

-- the delays at the time of the time the suit

9

was passed or the act was passed weren't so

10

great, so I think that sort of cuts against

11

thinking that Congress couldn't have wanted

12

this.

13

As to the problems, I -- I think

14

they're overstated.

Let me start by saying

15

first, though, that the Copyright Office also

16

desires efficient and quick registration.

17

the last three years, the Copyright Office has

18

sought and received appropriations to increase

19

their examination staff by about 60 percent.

20

As those people are trained and get

In

21

into the -- into the workforce, I think we're

22

going to see, and we've already seen --

23
24
25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You're not denying

there are delays and the delays are a problem?
MR. ELLIS:

Not -- I'm not denying --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

I'm not denying there are delays, and I'm not

2

denying that there is dissatisfaction with

3

delays.

4
5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Yes.

And the word

problem I won't use.

6

MR. ELLIS:

I think the second thing

The second is the live broadcast.

16

The third hasn't been mentioned this

17

morning, and it's actually not mentioned in the

18

brief, so I think it's worth pointing out.

19

There are a lot of hypotheticals about

20

what about this online proliferation of my work

21

and what do I do?

22

Copyright Act discusses secondary liability for

23

online service providers and it provides

24

immunity in certain circumstances.

25

Well, Section 512 of the

One of those requirements is that you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

have a take-down regime such that if -- think

2

about YouTube or something like this -- if a

3

copyright owner comes to you and says there's a

4

work on your site that's infringing my

5

copyrights, you have to take it down.

6

And that's not -- does not turn on

7

whether the work is registered or not.

8

me.

9

Congress is receptive to these -- to these

10

Excuse

So I think what that shows is that

dissatisfaction.

11

It has weighed in multiple times, at

12

the same time trying to balance these concerns

13

against the real benefits of registration, and

14

the real benefits of having the Copyright

15

Office participate in this -- in this

16

examination, and then have the right to

17

participate and provide their views to the

18

court.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand

20

your textual argument about the incongruity of

21

the same phrase having two different meanings

22

in 411.

23

compelling than your friend's argument listing

24

all the time -- all the other sections where it

25

has -- your reading would require it to mean

But it's -- it's not that much more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

different things as well.

2

MR. ELLIS:

So -- so, again, I don't

3

-- we don't think that's actually true.

4

don't want to get into a debate about -- unless

5

you'd like to -- about 10 other provisions of

6

the Act.

7

But I

I think it's enough to say that he

8

admits that 708 uses it in that way, uses

9

"registration has been made" to refer to the

10

act of the copyright owner -- excuse me, the

11

act of the Register.

12

shouldn't put any weight on that because it

13

wasn't in the '76 Act, that this Court tries to

14

make sense of a statutory scheme as a whole.

And now he says you

15

And then there's the constructive

16

notice provisions that I tried to walk the

17

Court through where it just can't make sense

18

there to refer to it.

19

And so we're back to saying, well,

20

what makes sense for this provision?

And I

21

think because what makes sense for this

22

provision for a host of reasons is that -- is

23

that registration has been made in the first

24

sentence, is using the word "register" in the

25

same way that everybody agrees register --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

registration is being used in the second

2

sentence.

3

Just to say a word about these --

4

these cases that the other side points to,

5

Vacheron, and I think in the brief they cited a

6

couple others that they didn't do this morning.

7

You know, you can look at those decisions for

8

yourselves and decide what the debate was.

9

But, if you want to sort of get behind

10

the text and figure out what Congress was

11

getting after, I don't think you can do a lot

12

better than looking at the legislative record

13

itself.

14

1961 report by the Copyright Office to Congress

15

that addresses this very question in Vacheron

16

and what should be done about it.

17

And I would point you first to the

And what the Copyright Office said is

18

that registration is important.

You should

19

maintain that requirement with one

20

modification.

21

situation in Vacheron where, after the

22

Copyright Office, the register has refused

23

registration, the copyright owner has to file

24

two suits:

25

Register to get -- issue -- issue a

You should address this

a mandamus suit against the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

certification and, second, your infringement

2

action.

3

What you should do in that case is to

4

combine those suits.

5

and third sentence of 411(a) does.

6

That's what the second

Then, when you look at the first act

7

introduced into the House, 1964, written by the

8

Copyright Office, unsurprisingly, it adopts the

9

recommendation.

When you look at the 1976 Act,

10

it doesn't change, by the way, between 1964 and

11

enactment in 1976.

12

report at page 157 and it confirms.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20

Thank you,

counsel.

15
16

Then you look at the House

MR. PANNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

21

I want to emphasize that our argument

22

relies primarily on the text of Section 411(a)

23

and the fact that it uses the phrase

24

"registration has been made" and that in the

25

Act, that phrase and that construction

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

consistently refers to the action of the

2

copyright owner.

3

It's revealing that in the legislative

4

history, which is included in the -- in the

5

codification of the Act, it says that a

6

copyright owner who has not -- who has not

7

registered his claim can have a valid cause of

8

action against someone who has infringed his

9

copyright, but he cannot enforce his rights in

10
11

the courts until he has made registration.
That is -- and, again, in

12

Section 411(b) of the 1976 Act, now 411(c), the

13

copyright owner makes registration.

14

It is a really consistent usage in the

15

statute that when Congress was referring to the

16

action of the copyright owner, it used that

17

phraseology.

18

Section 708(a), as the government has

19

acknowledged, was adopted in 1982.

20

nothing to do with litigation rights and

21

remedies and, therefore, really says nothing

22

about how the provision should be properly

23

construed in Section 411(a).

24
25

And I want to -- you know,

It has

And the constructive notice provisions
-- there is actually a constructive notice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

provision that talks about actual notice, but

2

the other constructive notice provisions quite

3

sensibly protect the copyright owner if the

4

copyright owner has done what the copyright

5

owner is required to do to register the claim,

6

namely, submit the required application --

7

application, deposit, and fee.

8
9

And recall that as -- if the time of
examination was quite short at the time of the

10

adoption of the Act, that was unlikely to

11

prejudice anyone because registration would --

12

would come through quickly.

13

And, you know, so it makes perfect

14

sense that the -- in the same way that that is

15

sufficient to protect the rights, to protect

16

the remedies available to the copyright owner,

17

that it is also appropriate to open the court

18

-- the gates of the courthouse.

19

It's surprising to me that the

20

government relies so heavily, by the way, on

21

those constructive notice provisions because

22

copyright -- publication with notice is no

23

longer required under the Act.

24
25

So this is all -- this is all an issue
that would have gone away in 1988 with regard

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

to the notice.

2

makes sense to protect copyright owners and to

3

give them their rights and remedies.

4

that's what the -- upon compliance with

5

Section 408(a), the submission of the required

6

application, deposit, and fee, and that's what

7

the statute says.

8
9

But the key point is that it

And

That is what the text says.

And I think it's also important to
read that in light of the history.

And the key

10

issue that was debated between the majority

11

opinion and the dissent in Vacheron is whether

12

the copyright owner should be prevented from

13

gaining access to judicial remedies because the

14

Copyright Office had not yet acted or granted

15

the registration.

16

Now it's true that in that case there

17

had been a refusal, and the question was

18

whether mandamus was required, but the same

19

consequences occur in the case of Copyright

20

Office inaction.

21

If there's a circumstance where the

22

Copyright Office does not act, the question is:

23

Can you go to court?

24

that Congress would have said in the case of

25

refusal, you can go to court, you don't need to

And it's inconceivable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

seek a judicial remedy, but in the case of

2

inaction, you can't go to court, and you have

3

to somehow seek a mandamus to get a decision

4

before going to court.

5

It makes all the sense in the world to

6

understand that language to say what it clearly

7

says within the phraseology of the Act, that if

8

the copyright owner has made registration under

9

Section 408(a), that the copyright owner is

10

then entitled to sue.

11

And the -- the conceit that Congress

12

intended to require administrative exhaustion

13

or was concerned about copyright quality, that

14

is -- there's no basis for that in the text of

15

the statute.

16

history of the -- of -- of what Congress said,

17

what the committee report said about the Act,

18

for what that's worth.

19

There's no basis for it in the

The key point is that the registration

20

requirement has its purpose, and that purpose

21

is vindicated if the copyright owner has

22

submitted the required application, deposit,

23

and fee, as Section 408 requires.
