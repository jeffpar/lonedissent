CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument this morning in Case 17-1299,

5

Franchise Tax Board of California versus Hyatt.

6

Mr. Waxman.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The participants in the ratification

12

debates disagreed about whether the new

13

constitution would, or should, subject states

14

to suit in the new courts of the soon-to-be

15

superior sovereign, but they were unanimous in

16

their understanding that states could not be

17

sued in the courts of other states.

18

Edmund Pendleton, chairing the

19

Virginia Convention, proclaimed "the

20

impossibility of calling a sovereign before the

21

jurisdiction of another sovereign," echoing

22

writings and speeches given by Hamilton,

23

Marshall, and Madison, among others.

24

Chisholm itself, Edmund Randolph --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In

Counsel, it's nice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

that they felt that way, but what we know is

2

they didn't put it in the Constitution.

3

we talk a lot now about not relying on

4

legislative history but relying on the plain

5

text of the Constitution.

6

And so

Could you tell me what there is in our

7

original case, the Nevada -- in our original

8

case, that didn't address this argument and say

9

it wasn't compelling?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12
13
14
15
16

So -What is new

from -MR. WAXMAN:
original case.

Are -- you say the

Do you mean Nevada versus Hall?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

What's --

what -- what is new --

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Well --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- in any of the

19

arguments that were raised in Nevada versus

20

Hall that weren't addressed by the Court?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

first of all, what was new --

23
24
25

Well, as we point out --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
was wrong.

I know you say it

Putting aside the wrongness.

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I want to -- I want

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

to -- I -- I -- I'm not going to harp on the

2

wrongness.

3

from our petition and our merits brief.

4
5

I think that's relatively clear

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I know

that's your position, but let's --

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Yeah.

I think before I

7

address what the Court missed in Nevada versus

8

Hall, I just want to point out that when you

9

say what changed, the only thing -- Nevada

10

versus Hall represents the only case in state

11

or federal court in the 200 years prior that

12

had ever recognized the ability of one state to

13

compel another state to answer.

14

cases.

15

It cited zero

And while it isn't new, from the time

16

this Court -- at least the time this Court

17

decided Hans versus Louisiana until whatever

18

its most recent case was on sovereign immunity,

19

it has always stated repeatedly, uniformly,

20

that, as the Court explained in -- in Alden,

21

state sovereign immunity is demarcated by

22

fundamental postulates implicit in the

23

constitutional design.

24

immunity derives from the structure of the

25

original constitution."

It -- "sovereign

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

Now I can --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do you

3

think is the structure, since most sovereign

4

immunity -- there's a lot of customary law

5

involving it, but, at the essence, and it was

6

this way in the United States for a very long

7

time, recognizing the sovereign immunity of a

8

foreign state was at the discretion of the host

9

state.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

So --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now the U.S.

12

followed the pattern, but, in the Tate letter,

13

it changed it around.

14

constitutional design reflects the willingness

15

of one state to give up its power to protect

16

its own citizens from the actions of another

17

state who might intrude directly?

18

What do you think in the

Now we know, because we recently had a

19

case, that states can be sued.

20

that case?

21
22

I can't remember now.

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't know what you're

talking about.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Were you on

yeah.

That there --

We had a case recently where there's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

question about whether a state can be sued to

2

quiet title in another state.

3

owns property in another state, it can be

4

hauled into court to quiet title of that

5

property.

6

So, if one state

So we know that the rule wasn't

7

absolute possibly, and so the question I have

8

is where in the constitutional design do we

9

see, and in light of the -- of the

10

constitutional reservation to states of all

11

powers not designated by the Constitution,

12

their willing -- their ability to protect their

13

own citizens in their own states?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

So I'm going to --

15

I'm going to give you what I believe are the

16

textual -- the textual basis in the

17

Constitution itself for the implicit plan, the

18

underlying postulate that this Court has

19

recognized for well over 130 years.

20

But let me just address first your

21

point about, you know, international --

22

national comity -- international comity under

23

the law of nations.

24

with no superior sovereign and no superior --

25

and no mechanism to enforce their rights under

It is true that nations

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

the law of nations had the raw power to violate

2

the law of nations obligation that friendly

3

states respect each other's sovereign immunity,

4

just as nations had the raw power to violate

5

each other's borders or declare war or to

6

refuse to recognize each other's judgments.

7

But the states of the union, in

8

ratifying the Constitution to -- to form a more

9

perfect union, surrendered their powers to

10

treat each other as legal strangers.

11

up the so -- the perhaps --

12
13
14
15
16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They gave

But just so I

understand you -MR. WAXMAN:

-- wild west of

international law.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, just so I

17

understand you, are you saying that the states,

18

pre the Constitution, were in the same position

19

as foreign nations?

20

their immunity then was a matter of comity,

21

rather than as -- a matter of legal

22

requirement?

23

In other words, it was --

Is that correct?

MR. WAXMAN:

So my view is -- my view

24

is -- and I think this is -- this is well

25

recognized in the Court's cases -- that prior

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

to -- certainly, prior to the Articles of

2

Confederation, but, you know, in any event,

3

prior to the Constitution, the states stood in

4

respect to each other and had obligations under

5

the law of nations.

6

And the law of nations, you know, it's

7

true that the -- in essence, the law of nation

8

obligation to not haul an unconsenting

9

sovereign into your courts was unenforceable,

10

and it's true that this Court has referred to

11

it as, therefore, in effect, a matter of

12

comity.

13

And states were in that situation.

14

But this Court explained in First National City

15

Bank versus the Bank of China and in the

16

Sabbatino versus Cuba case that -- and it's

17

reflected in The Schooner Exchange itself, that

18

what comity meant was that there was no

19

obligation to adhere to -- to apply that or any

20

other law of nations except with respect to

21

friendly nations that the sovereign recognized.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MR. WAXMAN:

What do you --

And those -- that

24

certainly characterized the -- the states of

25

the union.

And that's why, you know, this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

Court in Alden and many other cases said that

2

"the contours of sovereign immunity are

3

determined by the founders' understanding."

4

And their understanding, expressed by the anti-

5

federalists, the federalists who thought it

6

would be terrific if states could be sued in

7

federal court, and the federalists who -- like

8

Madison and Marshall, who assured everyone that

9

it wouldn't, they all understood that because

10

the states were recognized by each other and

11

were friendly, there was an absolute law of

12

nations immunity.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's odd then that

14

Marshall didn't say that in Schooner McFaddon,

15

nor did Joseph Story in Santissima Trinidad or

16

whatever it is, nor did Vattel.

17

was it's a question of consent, that, of

18

course, the state -- I mean, I can read it to

19

you:

20

power of a nation within its own territory must

21

be traced up to the consent of the nation

22

itself."

"All exceptions to the full and complete

And --

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

What they said

Yes.
-- that's what they

said.

Official - Subject to Final Review
11

MR. WAXMAN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

language like raw power.

But what I found was

4

it's a matter of comity.

It's a matter of

5

consent.

6

it.

7

Yes.

And -I didn't find

And, of course, most nations follow

But, if somebody didn't, you couldn't

8

say it violated international law.

And then

9

the question that I'd like to hear the answer

10

to is -- is what Justice Sotomayor asked.

11

of course, the founders were all talking about

12

a situation where they were worried about

13

federal power and the federal suit and bringing

14

who could sue people under the federal power.

15

And,

So, when I looked at this before,

16

which I did, I found international authority

17

after international authority, many, that said

18

just what Marshall said, that said just what

19

Story said, and you say, well, are states

20

different?

21

respects.

22

Well, they're not different in two

Almost all of them do give immunity to

23

the other state.

But, if you find an outlier

24

that doesn't, you can't say it violates

25

international law.

Were they states?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There we

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

have Justice Sotomayor's question.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

With --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what in the

4

Constitution, it would have to be something

5

that in this respect makes them less sovereign,

6

what is it that says you can't have an outlier?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

So, when you say, you

8

know, if some states refuse to recognize that

9

principle, well, that was one thing.

No state

10

before ratification, until Nevada versus Hall,

11

had ever done such a thing.

12

This Court before Nevada versus Hall

13

in a half a dozen cases stretching over 100

14

years --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know they didn't.

16

That isn't quite my question.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Well, but -Of course, they

didn't.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

So --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Almost all countries

22

recognize sovereign immunity.

But you might

23

have one, I mean, I don't know, maybe Tasmania

24

if it was a country then didn't recognize it

25

and the question is, do you have to?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

MR. WAXMAN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

So -And the answer of

Marshall, Story, Vattel, no, you don't have to.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

So I think Vattel, who

5

was quoted and referenced in -- I'm going to

6

talk about Vattel, The Schooner Exchange, and

7

then the point of what changed when the

8

Constitution was adopted, and then where in the

9

text of the Constitution I'm citing my

10

authority, which I -- I forgot to address.

11

Vattel and other commentators at the

12

time whose jurisprudence was also referenced in

13

the ratification debate held -- stated that

14

sovereign immunity was a mandatory limit on the

15

power of one sovereign to adjudicate another's

16

claim, another -- to adjudicate claims against

17

another sovereign.

18

response to a violation of that law of nations

19

was war.

20

And he held that the

Now, in The Schooner Exchange, Chief

21

Justice Marshall says:

22

sovereign has absolute territory -- absolute

23

discretion over its own territory.

24
25

Of course, you -- a

There is a law of nations principle
that friendly nations whose -- in that case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14

whose ships appear in our ports, whose

2

sovereign ships that appear in our ports, under

3

the law, there are certain principles under the

4

law of nations in which the host state is

5

deemed as a matter of the law of nations to

6

have waived its sovereign authority to have its

7

courts exercise jurisdiction.

8

why that was the case.

9

implicit consent.

And he explained

That is, there was an

10

Now, in the plan of convention, the

11

states -- you know, at international law, if

12

there was a violation of it, the nations had

13

all sorts of retaliatory measures.

14

blockade each other, embargo each other, make

15

war on each other, all sorts of things.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

They could

Well, Marshall --

17

Marshall, who is a pretty good authority -- I

18

happen to know this because we had this case

19

before.

But if you --

20

MR. WAXMAN:

You did?

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- look at quotes 4,

22

Vattel, 472, okay, and what he says Vattel says

23

-- I never read all those pages, I read some of

24

them -- he says Vattel says that the consent of

25

a foreign sovereign may be implied through a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

tacit convention, but it suggests that it

2

rested upon consent.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5
6

So -- and -It says that consent

may be applied.
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, and with respect,

7

Justice Breyer, what The Schooner Exchange says

8

several times in Justice Mar -- Chief Justice

9

Marshall's opinion, is that the state --

10

sovereign states are deemed to have consented

11

to recognize the sovereign immunity of other

12

sovereigns in those instances in which, and

13

that are enumerated, and he explains why a

14

visiting warship of a friendly nation is one of

15

those things.

16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:
waste time.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

Well, I don't want to

Mister --

Now, even if -- even if

I'm -- oh, I'm sorry.

Can I?

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Yeah, sure.

Even if I'm wrong about

23

that, the fact of the matter is that in the

24

plan of convention and in the text itself, the

25

states, in order to form a more perfect union,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

surrendered all of the retaliatory means that

2

nations would have had in order to deter or

3

enforce --

4
5

JUSTICE KAGAN:
understood --

6
7
8
9

Well, that's what I

MR. WAXMAN:

-- or punish violations,

and -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, that's

what I understood your basic argument to be,

10

right, that there was this system of comity, it

11

all worked very well, essentially at least in

12

part because states knew that they had all

13

these powers that they could use against each

14

other, and then they gave up those powers at

15

the convention.

16

replaced it was a constitutional rule.

17

your basic story.

So what replaced it?

What
That's

Is that correct?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, a constitutional --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I guess I just

20

find myself thinking that, I mean, sort of, you

21

know, going back to Justice Sotomayor's

22

question, what's the evidence of that, because

23

this is a gigantic constitute -- you know,

24

constitutional debate.

25

issues on the table.

There are a thousand
Everybody has things that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1
2

they want.
And this idea that there's this

3

one-for-one exchange that you have, we give up

4

our power to blockade, we get a rule of

5

sovereign immunity, I mean, that's just not how

6

big negotiations work.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

What was -And unless you can

show me evidence that that was the trade, I

10

mean, if I could just -- if you would bear with

11

me for one more moment -- Professors Baude and

12

Sachs tell about another trade.

13

that there wasn't a rule of sovereign immunity,

14

but the states retained their ability not to

15

enforce judgments against them if they violated

16

their own immunity.

17

Their trade is

So I guess what I'm saying is all of

18

these trades, you can hypothesize them, but

19

they are just hypotheses.

20

evidence for any of them?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

And what's the

So I would say the

22

evidence -- I mean, there -- there is a lot of

23

evidence -- I don't think there's any

24

disagreement that the framers intended to

25

constitutionalize fundamental aspects of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

sovereignty.

2

The reference to the former colonies

3

as states, the reference to in the privileges

4

and immunities clause of citizens of states,

5

the limitation, the express limitations in the

6

Constitution, including Section 10 of Article

7

I, and, of course, the Eleventh Amendment

8

itself, make sense only if the states are

9

sovereign.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, maybe that's --

Now --- your answer to this

13

question, but I'm still, you know -- because we

14

are all always very vigilant not to read things

15

into the Constitution that can't be found in

16

the text, I'm waiting for the answer to Justice

17

Sotomayor's question about what provisions of

18

the Constitution you would point to.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

So I -- I've -- I would

20

point to the provisions of the Constitution

21

that are enumerated by Justice Scalia in his

22

opinion for the Court in Printz, which were

23

reiterated again by Justice Kennedy for the

24

Court in Alden, some of which I have -- I have

25

recognized, I -- I have -- I have already

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19

recited.

2

The -- the -- preserving fundamental

3

aspects of sovereignty yet withdrawing the

4

ability to protect sovereignty vis-a-vis either

5

nations or other states was in -- in exchange

6

for a guarantee that the then law of nations --

7

the then principle of sovereignty under the law

8

of nations would be protected by the

9

Constitution and enforced by this Court.

10

Justice Kagan has referred to it as a

11

one-for-one bargain.

12

was, was the plan -- the genius of the

13

Constitution, the structural provisions of the

14

Constitution was that the states, having had an

15

unsatisfactory experience with confederation,

16

by ratifying, they surrendered their powers to

17

treat each other as legal strangers.

18

But what there really

In other words, in Chief Justice

19

Marshall's words, they were deemed to waive

20

whatever sovereign prerogative they had to

21

violate the law of nations principle and haul

22

one another into each other's courts.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

And --

Given how --

-- that I -- I -- I mean

--

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Given -- given how

2

important this is, as you describe, why is it

3

not in the text of the Constitution in your

4

view, given that the Constitution is a

5

document, in my view, of majestic specificity.

6

It's got a lot of specific details on very

7

minute things, and this issue which you say

8

rightly is so important, but then somehow was

9

not mentioned in the text of the Constitution.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I mean, this --

11

this Court has been explaining at least since

12

Hans that the principle of sovereign

13

immunity -- of state sovereign immunity was so

14

fundamental that it is a postulate that

15

underlies and gives meaning to other provisions

16

of the Constitution, including, as -- as then

17

which is, you know, given that you're claiming

that the system of comity, which was working

well for all the states, that this system was

21

converted into a particular constitutional rule

22

at the framing, and a very particular one,

because there could have been other ways, as

states to protect themselves.

evidence.

historical evidence that the states made

exactly this bargain at the framing?

What's the best textual or

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Let me take a try

with something I haven't hauled out yet.
Inherent in our federal union is the

11

principle that no state may regulate the

12

government of another state.

13

state's governor can't direct the bureaucracy

14

of another and one state's legislature can't

15

regulate the government actions of another, one

16

state's judiciary can't call another state's

17

government to the bar of the court and sanction

18

it for carrying out its own laws.

19

And just as one

That is unconstitutional interference

20

with the independence of the states, just as

21

reflected in these other non-textual

22

constitutional principles that I previously

23

identified.

acknowledge that there was a universal rule in

but it wasn't constitutionalized.

Professors Baude and Sachs

Their argument is it

It wasn't abrogated,

The world in which -- the regime they

envision in which states can ignore what they

acknowledge to be a universal rule but don't

worry about it, because by invoking common law

precedents superseded 150 years ago by Pennoyer

versus Neff, states can just refuse to honor

any resulting judgment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Good morning,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

25

Forty years ago in Nevada versus Hall,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

this Court held that states may exercise their

2

sovereign power under the Tenth Amendment to

3

define the jurisdiction of the courts to

4

protect their citizens when they're injured,

5

including by other states.

6

compelling reason for overruling this

7

precedent, discarding stare decisis.

8

very least, in this case, under the law of the

9

case doctrine, this is the established law.

10

There's no

At the

In Nevada versus Hall, this Court

11

concluded by saying that to prevent states from

12

exercising their jurisdiction in this manner

13

would be the real intrusion on the power of the

14

states and the people of the United States.

15

Under the Tenth Amendment, the

16

question for this Court is, is there anything

17

in the Constitution that keeps states from

18

exercising this jurisdiction?

19

Court can look to three sources:

20

the Constitution itself, the Constitutional

21

Convention, and the pre-ratification history.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'd suggest this
the text of

Mr. Chemerinsky,

23

your -- Mr. Waxman did point to something

24

that's important.

25

we would say it would be wrong for one state to

Intuitively and otherwise,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

tell another state how to run its government or

2

how to run an agency or what rules it should

3

follow within its own state.

4

What in -- then what is it that keeps

5

them from doing that if it's not the

6

constitutional structure?

7

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

First, comity

8

protects states.

9

existed at the pre-ratification period and

10

continues.

11

that comity.

12

This is the comity that

This case shows the importance of

Initially, the Nevada Supreme Court

13

excluded all negligence claims based on comity.

14

Then the Nevada Supreme Court struck a $250

15

million punitive damage award based on comity.

16

It shows that comity was protection both in the

17

pre-ratification period and now.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I just don't

19

see comity being enough.

I know one of your

20

amici suggested that questions of personal

21

jurisdiction should take care of most cases.

22

And, actually, I did look at this case

23

and I was trying to figure out what it was that

24

Nevada did to intrude or what California did to

25

intrude physically on Nevada.

And I know that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

the supposed agent who was doing this

2

investigation -- not supposed, she is an agent

3

-- crossed state lines, I think it was alleged,

4

and rummaged through garbage and rummaged

5

through personal mail.

6

Is that correct?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, they invaded

7

his property rights.

8

also revealed private information about him to

9

a large audience.

10
11

They defamed him.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They

But was that in

Nevada or in California?

12

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

13

at his home they did these things.

14

it's crucial, Justice Sotomayor, because while

15

there's the importance of one state not

16

regulating another, there's also the crucial

17

interest that a state has in protecting its

18

citizens when they're injured, including by

19

another state.

20

that as a vital interest of the states.

21

That was in Nevada
And I think

This Court has long recognized

But, to go back to your initial

22

question, in addition to comity, in addition to

23

personal jurisdiction, this Court created a

24

very important protection for states when this

25

case was last there.

This Court said that a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

state, when suing another state, is liable for

2

no more than the form state would be liable

3

for.

4

that rule, which this Court found on full faith

5

and credit, was limited to $100,000.

So the damage judgment on the basis of

6

I'd go back to your initial question

7

to Mr. Waxman, the text of the Constitution.

8

Where the text of the Constitution wanted to

9

limit state power, it did so explicitly:

the

10

full faith and credit clause, the fugitive

11

slave clause, the privilege and immunities

12

clause.

13

Constitution that limits the power of a state

14

under the Tenth Amendment to define its own

15

jurisdiction provide a remedy for others when

16

they're injured.

17

There is no textual provision in the

If you -- if you look at the

18

Constitutional Convention, this wasn't

19

discussed at the Constitutional Convention.

20

fact, in Nevada versus Hall, this Court

21

explicitly said, and I quote, "it was not a

22

matter of concern."

23

And then you can go to the

24

pre-ratification period, and, Justice Kagan,

25

you summarized it accurately.

In the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

pre-ratification period, the protection that a

2

state had from another state was based on

3

comity.

4

32 of the Petitioner's brief, it explicitly

5

says in the pre-ratification period there was

6

no protection based on sovereign immunity.

7

was comity, the same comity that exists today

8

to protect a state from another state.

9

In fact, if you look at pages 31 and

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It

What do you do

10

with Federalist 81, which said that it was

11

inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be

12

amenable to the suit of an individual without

13

its consent and said that would remain with the

14

states?

15

Federalist 81, reflecting a notion that it's

16

inherent to the nature of sovereignty.

That was Hamilton speaking in

17

Is that incorrect?

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, it's

19

not incorrect, but you must put it in the

20

context in which it's written.

21

that time was whether the new government and

22

these new federal courts were able to hold

23

state governments liable.

24

afraid because of debts they might be bankrupt.

25

And so Hamilton was providing

12

courts.

13

other states from being sued.

14

It was only comity that protected

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think it's

15

plausible that there would be a great concern

16

about a state's being sued in a federal court,

17

which is a more neutral tribunal, but no

18

concern about a state being sued in the state

19

-- in the courts of another state?

20

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

21
22

Yes, for two

reasons, Your Honor.
First, the framers were very

23

concerned, especially the anti-federalists were

24

concerned about the powers of this new level of

25

government, the federal courts.

They had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

already seen that they had protection state to

state based on comity.

3

And, second, Your Honor, quite

4

important, the states didn't want to give up

5

their own power.

7

suits against other states, put a limit on

8

state power, the states didn't perceive it

Had the states put in the

want to restrict their own authority.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But the comity that

12

exists -- well, what is your answer to the --

13

to the argument that -- that once the United

14

States was formed, either under the articles or

15

under the Constitution, the relationship

16

between the states was entirely different from

17

the relationship among foreign states?

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, it

19

was different.

Where the Constitution wanted

20

to make it different, it said so explicitly in

21

provisions like the full faith and credit

22

clause, the fugitive slave clause, and the

23

privilege and immunities clause.

24

indication of such a limit in the text of the

25

Constitution, in the Constitutional Convention,

There is no

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

You know, if

California were a republic, I mean, we had the

5

something some people in California would like

--

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

of leverage over Nevada that it doesn't have
now, wouldn't it?

11
12

-- it would have a lot

MR. CHEMERINSKY:
Your Honor.

13

Well, yes and no,

Certainly --

JUSTICE ALITO:

We could have, you

14

know, it overwhelms it in every respect.

15

Nevada would have to be careful about what it

16

did to California.

17

different because they're states in the union.

18

So

But the situation now is

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I think Nevada might

19

already feel that California overwhelms it too

20

much.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, in terms of

23

international, I go back to Justice Breyer's

24

point with regard to his questions to Mr.

25

Waxman.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

The Schooner Exchange case said that

2

under the national law, the only protection a

3

foreign country had on another sovereign was

4

based on comity.

5

that that was insufficient.

6
7
8
9

And there's no indication

The reality is that this is an issue
that relatively rarely arises.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the

remedy for the failure to accord comity at

10

international law was recognized to be war.

11

What remedy do the states have under your view

12

if a state chooses not to extend comity to a

13

sister state?

14

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, they certainly

15

have remedy in this Court based on Hyatt II.

16

The damages would be limited to the amount that

17

the forum state would be liable.

18

And, second, they have a perspective

19

remedy that's quite important.

States can

20

enter into a compact with one another to

21

prevent themselves from being sued.

22

Justice Sotomayor talked about --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

That requires

an agreement of the other states.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, for example,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

to go back to Justice Alito's question,

2

California and Nevada could enter into a

3

compact any time they want that they will not

4

allow suits in their courts against the other

5

state.

6

doing that.

7

There's nothing to keep the states from

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

8

have to assume that the -- the two states are

9

willing to do that.

Nevada may think that

10

given the disparity in a number of respects

11

between them and -- and California that its

12

best hope is to be able to sue California in

13

its states.

14

So it has an entirely different view

15

of the significance of that right than

16

California would.

17

just go agree on something is not going to be a

18

complete answer.

19

The idea that, well, you can

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, Your Honor,

20

that's true, but then you go back to the Tenth

21

Amendment.

22

power as a state to choose to not enter a

23

compact, to define the jurisdiction of its

24

courts, and be able to provide a remedy when

25

its citizens are injured by another state?

Does Nevada have the sovereign

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1
2

That is part of its sovereign power,
which is exactly what Nevada versus Hall said.

3

Mr. Waxman says that there were no

4

cases prior to Nevada versus Hall.

Actually,

5

if you look at Footnote 29 in Nevada versus

6

Hall, it does cite to a case, State of Georgia

7

versus City of Chattanooga.

9

subject to eminent domain and judicial

It says that, if a

10

11

of property.

12

I think the key is there weren't many

13

cases either before Nevada versus Hall, and

14

there aren't many cases since Nevada versus

15

Hall.

16

arises very frequently.

17

arise, it is so important that a state be able

18

to exercise its sovereign power.

19

That's because this isn't something that
But, when it does

But, Your Honor, I would stress to you

20

that this doesn't come to the Court on a blank

21

slate, that there's a 40-year-old precedent,

22

and this Court has made clear that it will

23

overrule stare decisis only if there's a

24

compelling reason.

25

Everything that Mr. Waxman said to you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

today about the plan of the convention was

2

argued to this Court in 1979 in Nevada versus

3

Hall.

4

Nothing has changed since then.
Mr. Waxman in his brief points to this

5

Court's sovereign immunity decisions, but

6

they're quite distinguishable.

7

have been about the Eleventh Amendment and the

8

power of the federal courts.

9

that's quite different than whether or not the

Most of them

And, of course,

10

Constitution prohibits a state from hearing

11

suits brought by citizens of another state.

12

Alden versus Maine is quite

13

distinguishable because it involved whether

14

Congress could force a state to have suits

15

against itself.

16

Court explicitly drew a distinction between

17

sovereign immunity court, a state in its own

18

courts, as opposed to the ability to sue

19

another -- citizens of another state to sue in

20

state court.

21

said that it was consistent with Nevada versus

22

Hall.

23

In Alden versus Maine, this

Alden versus Maine very clearly

And so, in that sense, there is

24

nothing that is changed since this was argued

25

to this Court in 1979.

And there's no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

compelling reason for overturning stare

2

decisis.

3

Finally, I would argue to you that, at

4

the very least, the law of the case doctrine is

5

controlling in this case.

law that's developed subsequent to Nevada

12

versus Hall seems quite inconsistent with the

13

principles in the majority opinion and more

14

consistent with the principles in Justice

15

Rehnquist's dissent and the series of cases

16

that you describe?

17

In other words, if we were five years

18

after Nevada v. Hall being asked to overrule

19

it, that might have been a harder hill to

20

climb, but now that you have all these other

21

cases, that might leave Nevada versus Hall

22

seeming an outlier.

23

How do you respond to that argument?

24

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

25

I -- I disagree.

I

think that all of the subsequent cases were in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

a very distinguishable context.

2

they were about Congress's authority to

3

authorize suits against states.

4

whether or not federal courts can enter suits

5

against states.

6

or not Congress can require that a state court

7

hear suits against the state.

8
9

Primarily,

They're about

Alden versus Maine was whether

None of them involved the Tenth
Amendment question presented in this case:

Is

10

there anything in the Constitution that

11

prohibits a state from exercising jurisdiction?

12

But I'd especially direct you to the

13

language in Alden versus Maine at 527 at 738.

14

The Constitution did not reflect an agreement

15

among the states to respect the sovereign

16

immunity of one another, or at the same

17

decision, Alden versus Maine, pages 739 and

18

740, says a distinction is drawn between a

19

sovereign's immunity in its own courts and its

20

immunity in the courts of another sovereign.

21

And so we're asking you not simply to

22

adhere to Nevada versus Hall but also to adhere

23

to what this Court said in Alden versus Maine.

24

And so, in that sense, Justice Kavanaugh,

25

nothing has changed since 1979 in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

jurisprudence of this Court that would cast

2

doubt upon the holding in Nevada versus Hall.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How -- how should we

4

think about the fact that 47 or 45 or whatever

5

it is states have joined in this amicus brief,

6

indicating that they think that their sovereign

7

immunity power is a good deal more important

8

than the power that you've referenced to

9

protect their own citizens in their own courts?

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

The attorney

11

generals of those states filed a brief saying

12

they don't want to have to defend suits.

13

am sure the attorney generals of those states

14

would like to see you overrule Nevada versus

15

Hall, but I don't think you can equate a brief

16

filed by state attorney generals with the

17

position of state governments, either state

18

legislatures or state judiciaries.

19

And I

Indeed, if states cared so deeply, not

20

only could they amend the Constitution, as

21

Justice Sotomayor said, but as I said to Chief

22

Justice Roberts, they could enter into compacts

23

with one another to protect themselves from

24

suit.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43

pretty --

2
3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Have there been

attempts --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a pretty

5

remarkable assertion that we shouldn't

6

understand representations of the states'

7

attorneys general to represent the views of the

8

state.

9

apparatus of their own if they don't think the

I mean, each of the states have

10

attorney general -- and I don't know who you're

11

speaking of, whether it's a legislature or the

12

governor -- to direct the attorney general to

13

-- I guess it varies from state to state, but,

14

certainly, you would expect the attorney

15

generals' views to reflect the views of the

16

states.

17

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, the

18

attorney general is an officer of the state,

19

but I don't necessarily know that in filing the

20

brief in this Court, it's reflecting the views

21

of the state legislatures or the judiciaries.

22

The question is, do those state governments

23

want to give up the power to define the

24

jurisdiction of their courts and provide

25

remedies?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Should we

2

regard the submissions of the Solicitor General

3

here as reflecting the views of the United

4

States or simply the Solicitor General?

5

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

The Solicitor

6

General is representing the United States

7

Government.

8

Congress will agree with the position of the

9

Solicitor General.

10

That doesn't necessarily mean that

I'm not saying you should discard the

11

brief of the attorney general, but, in answer

12

to Justice Kagan, I was simply saying I

13

wouldn't necessarily assume, because the

14

attorney generals of the states don't want to

15

be sued, that the state governments want to

16

give up their sovereign power under the Tenth

17

Amendment, what we're talking about here today.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Have there been

19

attempts by the states to -- to enter into

20

agreements of this sort?

21

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Not that I'm aware

22

of, Your Honor, but I think that probably

23

reflects this isn't a serious problem.

24

doesn't arise all that often.

25

It

For example, if you look at the brief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

of those 44 states referred to, if you look at

2

page 13, they identify a total of nine cases

3

since 1979 where state governments have been

4

sued in other state courts.

5

And I would think that states would

6

want, if another state comes in and violates

7

the rights of its citizens, as happened here,

8

to be able to provide a remedy.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would the 47 states

10

that don't like this rule make an effort to

11

find things that has -- have happened to their

12

citizens in this state caused by Nevada, and so

13

they all start suing Nevada in their own

14

courts, perhaps Nevada's attitude would change.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It might, Your

17

Honor, but the fact that that hasn't happened

18

in 40 years --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Not a problem?
-- since Nevada

21

versus Hall leads one to the conclusion it's

22

not a problem.

23

states could begin retaliating against other

24

states, but it just hasn't happened.

25

does, states have the mechanism for protecting

We can certainly hypothesize

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And if it

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

themselves.

2

And states are protected already.

On the other hand, in a situation like

3

this, a citizen like Mr. Hyatt has no other

4

remedy but the ability to sue in state court

5

when he's injured by another state.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

could have gone to the California courts.

8
9

I'm sorry, he

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, he couldn't have

gone to the California courts because

10

California gives sovereign immunity to itself

11

and has a statute that gives broad protection.

12

In fact, Hyatt I --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's no --

14

there's no administrative process against the

15

-- the tax assessment that was laid against

16

him?

17

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, there was an

18

administrative proceeding with regard to the

19

tax assessment, something that's been pending

20

since the 1990s.

21

But in terms of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that

22

actually is a factual question I had.

23

was that ever adjudicated?

24
25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Did --

Yes, Your Honor.

August of 2017, the California State Board of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

Equalization overturned the Franchise Tax

2

Board's findings against Mr. Hyatt both with

3

regard to residency and fraud for 1991 and '92.

4

That is now on appeal in the California Office

5

of Tax Assessment.

6

But what's quite important, Your

7

Honors, that was about his tax liability in

8

California.

9

that were committed against him by California

This is a suit about the torts

10

officials within the State of Nevada.

11

that, he had no remedy in California courts.

12

For

In fact, Hyatt I, the first time this

13

case was before the court, was all about

14

whether or not Nevada, under full faith and

15

credit, had to accord sovereign immunity to

16

California, as it would have had in the

17

California courts.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could the Nevada

19

court have adjudicated the factual premises?

20

Could he have brought some sort of suit in

21

Nevada to adjudicate whether he was a resident

22

of California or not or to find that he had no

23

tax liability?

24
25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I think a challenge

to tax liability would be different, in part

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48

because of the Tax Injunction Act, and also

2

because of a different principle of comity

under Fair Assessment in Real Estate versus

4

McNary.

5

not about tax liability.

6

the invasion of property rights, the

7

defamation, the invasion of privacy rights that

8

occurred.

9

What's crucial about this case is it's
It's about torts:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, what

10

do you do about the Petitioner's argument that

11

it's incongruous that Indian tribes have this

12

sort of immunity while states don't?

13

the -- Chief Justice Marshall, who we've heard

14

about, described the tribes, of course, as

15

quasi-sovereigns, yet the states are recognized

16

as -- as sovereigns.

17

quasi-sovereigns enjoying immunity but the

18

actual sovereigns not under your position.

19
20
21

The --

So we have the

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Two responses, Your

Honor.
First, this Court has never decided

22

whether state courts can hear tort claims

23

against Indian tribes.

24

versus Bay Mills Indian Community, in Footnote

25

--

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

saying that it's an unresolved question.

there is a second point that may answer the

comment that you just made.

But

Congress has
This has

In fact, this Court in the Kiowa Tribe

of Oklahoma versus Manufacturing Technology

case said that tribal immunity is a subject of

federal law and is not subject to diminution by

21

the states.

22

the Indian tribes is quite different than the

23

relationship of Congress to the states.

24
25

The relationship of Congress to

And so Congress can limit state court
jurisdiction with regard to Indian affairs in a

50

way that Congress can't limit state court

2

jurisdiction under the Tenth Amendment.

3

it's quite distinguishable.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

The doctrine of stare

5

decisis serves many valuable purposes.

6

which one would you say most strongly, or which

7

ones would you say most strongly, supports your

8

argument here?

9

And if not, what other stare decisis factors

10
11

So

Is there any reliance here?

would you cite?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, I'd go back to

12

this Court's decision in the Hilton versus

13

South Carolina case, and this Court there said

14

adherence to precedent promotes stability,

15

predictability, and respect for judicial

16

authority.

17

And this was a case about overturning

18

precedent in the area of constitutional law.

19

This is about stability of law.

20

this has been the law.

21

predictability.

22

in filing the suits.

23

For 40 years,

It's about

People have relied upon this

But it's also about respect for

24

judicial authority.

This Court overturning its

25

own precedents inherently undermines that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

respect for judicial authority.

2

So I would say, in terms of all of the

3

values that are identified in Hilton, stare

4

decisis is important here.

5

Hilton that the Court said there has to be a

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I want to follow

13

that up, because this is a general question I

14

have and I'd like to call on your knowledge on

15

this, is this imaginary or not, what I'm about

16

to say, that every time we overrule a case,

17

it's like a little chink in an armor, because

18

lawyers have to use our cases to talk to

19

clients, and the client doesn't like what he's

20

hearing.

21

the field?

22

harder it is for the lawyer to say no.

23

Can we do anything about it, whatever
And the more cases we overrule, the

And, therefore, in many areas, people

24

start to ask us to overrule cases because, from

25

my point of view, there are many wrong cases.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

And that's true of every judge and law

2

professor.

3

And once you start down the road, you

4

have to be careful for that reason in part.

5

that true, or am I making it up out of my

6

imagination?

7

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Yes, Your Honor.
I thought that would

be your answer.

10

12

Is

Yes, I'm making it up

out of my imagination or it's true?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No.

Yes, it is

14

true, Your Honor, I totally agree with what you

15

said about the importance of stare decisis, in

16

fact, that --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Chemerinsky,

18

do you think that the public would have greater

19

respect for an institution that says, you know,

20

we're never going to admit we made a mistake,

21

because we said it and we decided it, we're

22

going to stick to it even if we think it's

23

wrong, or an institution that says, well, you

24

know, we're generally going to stick to what

25

we've done, but we're not perfect, and when we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

look back and we think we made a big mistake,

2

we're going to go back and correct it.

3
4
5

Which kind of institution would they
respect more?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Of course, this

6

Court should overrule precedent at times.

7

all agree that Brown versus Board of Education

8

needed to overrule Plessy versus Ferguson.

9

we also all agree that stare decisis matters.

10

This is just what Justice Breyer was

11

expressing.

12

We

But

And that's why I think this Court in

13

Hilton got it exactly right.

Precedent should

14

be overruled only where there is a compelling

15

reason for doing so.

16

And what I keep saying --

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But then the

18

question is how we figure out what the

19

compelling reason is, and that's very

20

difficult.

21

And you say nothing has changed.

22

That's true in a lot of cases where the Court

23

has nonetheless overruled a prior decision.

24

And so how are we supposed to think about it?

25

Is it enough, for example, if we think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

it's egregiously wrong and the prior decision

2

has severe practical consequences and there's

3

no real reliance interest at stake?

4

enough?

5

is hard, but what -- what I just said in terms

6

of egregiously wrong, severe practical

7

consequences, no real reliance, is that enough

8

in your view to overrule?

9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Is that

How to apply that to a particular case

I think egregiously

10

wrong, no practical consequence to overruling

11

precedent, certainly go a long way to

12

indicating there is a compelling reason for

13

doing so.

14

Is there anything today that's before the Court

15

that it didn't have when the earlier case was

16

decided?

17

But I'd also start always by asking:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, if we

18

applied that strictly, a lot of cases that

19

everyone agrees should be overruled would not

20

have been overruled.

21

questioning that particular factor.

22

And so I think -- I'm

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But I think it's a

23

starting point in the analysis.

And then I am

24

comfortable with the adverbs you use, like

25

egregiously wrong.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

And what I've argued here today is

2

that Nevada versus Hall not only was not

3

egregiously wrong but it was correctly decided.

4

But I would emphasize in conclusion that this

5

case is decided by the law of the case

6

doctrine.

7

Here, in the second time the case was

8

before you, you said you were affirming the

9

judgment by a four-to-four decision.

A

10

four-to-four split is a decision on the merits.

11

It's argued in the reply brief that we

12

waived this by not raising it in the brief in

13

opposition.

14

the Supreme Court and the key language that was

15

left out on page 3 of Petitioner's reply brief,

16

it says:

17

question presented based on what occurred in

18

the proceedings below -- those are the words

19

that are omitted in the reply brief -- if the

20

objection does not go to jurisdiction may be

21

waived and called to the court's attention in

22

the brief in opposition.

23

But, if you look at Rule 15.2 from

Any objection to consideration of a

No one in this litigation, not

24

Petitioner or Respondent, questions anything

25

that went on in the proceedings below.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

entirely a question for this Court, whether to

2

overrule Nevada versus Hall.

3

I would then conclude as I began.

In

4

Nevada versus Hall, this Court ended its

5

decision by saying that the real intrusion on

6

states were to keep them from exercising their

7

sovereign power to define their jurisdiction to

8

provide a remedy for their citizens when

9

they're injured by another state.

The Court

10

said that would be a diminution of the powers

11

of the people of the United States.

12

Thank you, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18
19

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

20

In McCulloch versus Maryland, Chief

21

Justice Marshall announced for the Court the

22

constitutional principle, the atextual

23

constitutional principle of intergovernmental

24

immunity because, as he explained, the power of

25

one sovereign to tax another is the power to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

destroy.

2

Today, Hall versus Nevada stands as

3

the only thing that states can do to each

4

other, the power to render judgments against

5

states that, when they entered the union, were

6

effectively bankrupt.

7

Revolutionary War debt.

8
9

They were loaded with

That power to subject sovereign
treasuries to judgments of other sovereigns'

10

courts is very much the power to destroy.

11

had anyone thought at the framing that, by

12

forming a more perfect union, that these

13

states, burdened with this debt, were

14

subjecting themselves to suits in other state

15

courts, the Constitution would never have been

16

adopted.

17

And

The notion that Chisholm's mistake was

18

not suing Georgia in the state courts of his

19

home state, South Carolina, would have been

20

considered an absurdity.

21

Now, as to stare decisis, this really

22

is a case where Hall is a "survivor of obsolete

23

constitutional thinking."

24
25

The question was, you know, what has
changed?

What have we done?

Recall that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

number of cases this Court has decided in the

2

sovereign immunity area, we're talking, you

3

know, not just Seminole Tribe but Union Gas,

4

Welch, Kiowa, all of those cases, and the

5

reasoning of those cases is the South Carolina

6

Ports Authority case, all long followed this

7

Court's decision.

8
9

And the basis for this Court's
decision in Nevada versus Hall, both of which

10

have been repudiated by this Court's later

11

jurisprudence, are, number one, the Court said

12

there's nothing explicit in the Constitution

13

and we're not going to read a -- an immunity

14

that is not explicit in the Constitution.

15

This Court in at least a dozen cases

16

has subsequently held over and over again that

17

what matters for the protection of sovereign

18

immunity was the framers' understanding at the

19

time of the framing and the postulates that

20

underlie the principles of the consequences of

21

giving up the wild west law of nations for a

22

more perfect union in which states won't

23

retaliate against each other by saying, well,

24

now we're going to -- you know, we're going to

25

allow everybody to sue other states in our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

court and we're going to do this and we're

2

going to do that.

3

The -- the other thing that is

4

different is, in Nevada versus Hall, this Court

5

identified one interest supported by the

6

principle of state sovereign immunity, and that

7

was the state's fiscs, which, of course, was

8

overwhelmingly important at the time of the

9

framing.

10

But, since then, this Court has said

11

in at least a half a dozen cases that the

12

dignity of states and their self-government

13

autonomy are, as the -- as Justice Thomas

14

explained for the Court in the Federal Maritime

15

Commission case, the paramount interests to be

16

protected by principles of sovereign immunity.

17

Neither of those two principles that

18

have since been elucidated by the Court were

19

referenced or acknowledged in Nevada versus

20

Hall.

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Waxman, counsel.

Thank you, Mr.
