ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
For three reasons, payment by an

18

employer to an employee for lost wages under

19

FELA is compensation under Section 3231(e)(1)

20

of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, or RRTA.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Blatt, before

22

you launch into that, can you tell us why the

23

railroad cares?

24

it's not -- he's not subject to the tax,

25

neither is the employer.

I mean, if he doesn't -- if

So what -- what is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1
2

the stake that you have in this?
MS. BLATT:

Sure.

I mean, although

3

the -- the Respondent argues that the employer

4

is subject on his fallback, but generally to

5

answer your question, the employer cares

6

because under a system that would credit all

7

lost wage FELA awards to retirement benefits

8

but without any -- any tax burden has a

9

long-term risk of insolvency or instability to

10

the system.

11

So there's a short-term savings to be

12

sure, and, generally, people don't like to pay

13

taxes for the sake of taxes, but the entire

14

purpose of this Tax Act is to fund the

15

retirement benefits for railroad employees, and

16

pensions are good for the railroads.

17
18

So that's the answer.
to the -- the three reasons.

19

First -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

If I could get

But there's no

personal -­

22

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sorry.
There's no

24

personal interest in the sense of, if we say

25

that it's not, then the railroad doesn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

withhold and pay the state.

2

Did you in this case?

You wanted a

3

credit against the award, but did you, in fact,

4

pay anything, any federal taxes beforehand?

5

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

So all $9,000 has

6

been paid.

The $6,000 portion of the employer

7

share was paid, and $3,000 was withheld from

8

the payment of the FELA award to account for

9

the employee's share.

And the railroad -- and

10

the reason why the dispute came up is the

11

railroad wants an offset for the $3,000 that

12

should have been withheld from the railroad

13

employee.

14

So -- get to the statutory text and

15

the first reason is the statutory text and

16

structure make clear that such a payment is for

17

services rendered and that employees need not

18

be in active service to pay for services

19

rendered.

20

Second, a payment for lost wages under

21

FELA is no different from the worker's

22

compensation, sickness, and disability pay that

23

Respondent agrees count as compensation.

24
25

And, third, taxing a payment for lost
wages under FELA furthers the RRTA's purpose to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

fund benefits under the Railroad Retirement

2

Act, or RRA.

3

First, a payment for lost wages under

4

FELA is remuneration paid for services rendered

5

as an employee under subsection (e)-1.

6

payment for lost wages under FELA compensates

7

the employee because he rendered services up

8

and until the time of injury.

9

definition, an employee cannot recover lost

A

Indeed, by

10

wages under FELA unless he had been rendering

11

services at the time of injury.

12

Additionally, this Court in Nierotko

13

and Quality Stores interpreted virtually

14

identical language under the Social Security

15

Act and FICA.

16

the phrase which defined wages for services

17

performed includes all compensation paid for

18

the employment relationship.

19

There, this Court interpreted

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Your opposing

20

counsel argues that Nierotko is discredited,

21

that that case didn't follow the text; we

22

shouldn't follow that methodology here.

23

you respond to that?

24
25

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

Can

Respondent argues

that it's discredited under Cleveland Indians

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

for the very last portion of Nierotko, which

2

has nothing to do with the question here.

3

the very last two paragraphs of Nierotko said

4

that you credit the amount of lost wages in the

5

-- in the period for which they're earned.

6

then Cleveland Indians came along and the IRS

7

said, yeah, we know that, but we want to credit

8

FICA in the period paid.

9

So

And

And so, in the opinion for the Court,

10

Cleveland Indians said we recognize that the

11

two should go in tandem, but we're going to

12

defer to the IRS, IRS's allocation.

13

there's a much more substantive distinction

14

because the employee wants all the benefits

15

under the benefits statute but none of the

16

ability.

17

And, here,

But I think your other question went

18

to the discreditedness.

19

somehow in 1946 the Court wasn't reading the

20

text.

I think that -­

21
22
23

I think you mean

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's their

argument.
MS. BLATT:

I think that's their

24

argument and I think it's certainly wrong.

25

fit the plain language because the employee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

rendered services, and nothing in the text says

2

that you can't be paid for periods of time when

3

you're not in active services because you

4

rendered services.

5

But the Court purported to be

6

interpreting the phrase "services performed,"

7

and you can say pragmatically, but I think it's

8

also textually, that when you have an

9

employment relationship and you compensate the

10

employee, that's generally for services

11

performed.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, counsel, when

13

I think of wages for services performed -- and

14

maybe it's too simplistic -- but I -­

15

MS. BLATT:

I doubt it.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We'll see.

I -- I

18

-- I think of it as the compensation that an -­

19

an employer voluntarily gives the employee.

20

not just the hourly wage, but the sick time,

21

the vacation time might be included as part of

22

the package.

23

present, I include that payment.

24
25

So

For the services when you are

I think of a judgment of a court for
negligence get -- awarded involuntarily against

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

the employer's consent as something very

2

different.

3
4

What's wrong with that?

MS. BLATT:

Okay.

I don't want to

call it simplistic, but I do think it's wrong.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

MS. BLATT:

Go ahead.

Okay.

Here's why.

I

7

mean, there's absolutely nothing in the statute

8

that makes anything that you said relevant.

9

just has to be a payment for services rendered.

10

And nothing in the statute distinguishes

11

between a legal obligation arising under your

12

contract -­

It

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, see,

14

that's not services rendered, is it?

15

payment for a judgment of a court.

16

MS. BLATT:

Right.

It's

And you can have a

17

disability payment that comes in the form of

18

judgment.

19

compensation is covered.

20

pay award in Nierotko was a judgment based on a

21

wrongful discharge by violation of a statute.

22

But there's just nothing in the -- in the sense

23

of the payment that it says it has to be either

24

from -- I think he concedes settlements count.

25

So I don't know why it's different that a court

He concedes that workers'

2

there's really no basis for -­

3

I mean, there's -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I get that

4

there's a tough line-drawing problem here, and

5

I have some questions for the other side on

6

that, but if you just in isolation deal with

7

the FELA judgment compared with, say, sick and

8

vacation time.

9

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

MS. BLATT:

What about -­

I think maybe you're going

12

to fault versus a no fault scheme, and nothing

13

in the statute says there has to be fault or no

14

fault.

15

--- he concedes is payment for services

16

17

negligence.

18

It's just like worker's compensation is

You just don't have to prove

But if you -- suing to get maternity

19

leave, you have to prove you're pregnant.

20

you're suing to get disability leave, you have

21

to prove that you're disabled.

22

23

that it was service-connected and that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. BLATT:

If

If you're suing

Can -­

-- you had injury.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So I

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

think what you're saying is, if you have to

2

sue, you can't be paid for services rendered,

3

but if the employer pays it voluntarily, that

4

definitely is atextual.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As a practical

6

matter, going back to a part of Justice

7

Gorsuch's question, in most state law verdicts,

8

there is just a payment.

9

verdict.

It's a general

How are you going to figure out which

10

part of the award is subject to the deduction?

11

And -- and Justice Gorsuch mentioned -­

12

mentioned a negligence judgment.

13

going to do with those?

14

What are we

Here, that's not at issue because

15

there's been a concession from the beginning

16

that this award had to do with past pay and

17

medical expenses.

18

FELA, but we may not know them in a general

19

verdict.

So we know the amounts under

So -­

20

MS. BLATT:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

argument have more purchase in those

23

situations?

24
25

MS. BLATT:

Of course.

Let me -­

-- does his

No, because, under the

Railroad Retirement Act in Section 231h(2) -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

this has been around since 1946 -- there's a

2

presumption that a personal injury award, the

3

entire amount, is treated for lost time.

4

And let me just point you to the JA on

5

78a, the Railroad Retirement Board gives you

6

sort of the -- the current -- the way they

7

treat this.

8

The statute says all of it counts for lost

9

time.

But let me go back to the statute.

However, the parties can take out any

10

amount that they want to allocate for reasons

11

other than lost time.

12

to say whatever they want.

13

$10 was lost time.

14

lost time.

15

So the parties are free
They can say that

They can say all of it was

So, in a general verdict situation,

16

you know, I think what the RRB would say is

17

we're going to count it all as lost time unless

18

there's an allocation made.

19

Now what Respondent tries to say is,

20

well, somehow there are some shenanigans going

21

on because, you know, there might be a reason

22

to attribute it less to lost time on the taxing

23

side, but let me tell you what's going to

24

happen if we lose because of h(2).

25

If we lose, an employee can take an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

entire judgment, no matter what was devoted to

2

lost time, and get full credit and pay zero

3

tax.

4

downside to doing that.

5

And the incentive will be there's no

So you would take all of it and get

6

your credit, and pay absolutely no taxes.

7

that's just h(2).

8

RRB guidance on it.

9

vouch, you know, confirm all this, but that's

10
11

And

In the statute, there's the
The SG's office can -- can

just the way this has been treated.
Now, in -- the state cases that have

12

addressed the issue have said that we'll use

13

the same allocation scheme on the taxing side.

14

So all three at least state supreme courts who

15

addressed it have decided that issue.

16

And, Justice Gorsuch, I do want to say

17

Nierotko involved a judgment, although it was

18

by the NLRB, so an agency judgment.

19

And, Justice Kavanaugh, let me just

20

say, although I think there's these textual and

21

the pragmatic definition the Court gave, I do

22

think it's worth just noting the concurrence of

23

Justice Frankfurter, who said sort of that, you

24

know, we're going to deem employees to be in

25

the service of the employer if they were forced

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

into idleness because of the employer's

2

wrongdoing.

3

I mean, that's just an alternative way

4

of looking at it.

5

that way, but -­

6

You don't have to look at it

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If -- if you're right

7

about that theory, why wouldn't the pain and

8

suffering component also count?

9

MS. BLATT:

Well, because the pain and

10

suffering is not payment for services rendered

11

in the same way a lost wage award is.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if I understood

13

your theory, it was something like it happened

14

while he was on the job, and, therefore, what

15

follows is -- is -- is -- can be understood as

16

services rendered.

17

MS. BLATT:

No.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the pain and

19

suffering as well.

It's like, well, you were

20

injured on the job and that's why you had this

21

pain and suffering.

22

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

It's not payment

23

for services rendered in the same way because

24

the amount of lost wages is directly tied to

25

the salary for services rendered.

And the pain

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

and suffering amount has nothing to do with

2

your salary, your employment, or anything else

3

about the employment relationship.

4

Plus, there's a strong textual

5

argument.

6

Congress has already distinguished between lost

7

time pay and other factors associated with a

8

personal injury award.

9

the parties are free to only count as a

10

You don't have to take my analysis.

So Congress has said

personal injury award just the lost wages.

11

So Congress was debating this back in

12

1946, all these issues about what to do with

13

things that were associated with other lost

14

time, and they settled on this we're going to

15

presume it's all counted, but we'll let you

16

take out anything that's not related to lost

17

wages.

18

So -- a question?

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The court -- court

20

of appeals relied heavily on the fact that

21

Congress in '75 and '83 took out the reference

22

to payment for time lost.

23
24
25

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

So, I mean, let's

start again with -- with first principles.
Under that view, that takes out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

everything, the vacation, the holiday,

2

everything.

3

Respondent doesn't -- concedes that away and

4

doesn't defend it for good reason.

5

So that's fine.

And I think that

And that's because the -- the rule

6

against superfluity has the provisions in

7

(e)(1) and (e)(4) that are time lost payments

8

for worker's compensation, sickness, and

9

disability.

And those exceptions wouldn't be

10

in there unless they were otherwise included

11

within the operative definition.

12

But, Justice Kavanaugh, let's look at

13

the timing, and I think that this is pretty

14

dispositive as well.

15

Congress added the sickness, worker's

16

compensation, and disability payments in 1977

17

and then amended them in 1981.

18

after Congress took out the including

19

remuneration paid for services rendered in '75.

20

So that was

And then when Congress took out in

21

1983 -- I'm sorry, in '75, when Congress took

22

out the phrase, then they added the exceptions

23

later, they also left in seven references to

24

time lost and personal injury in (e)(2).

25

know that Congress continued to think that time

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So we

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

lost payments were covered.

2

Now comes 1983 and Congress takes out

3

(e)(2), but it didn't change the operative

4

definition in (e)(1), and it left in all the

5

exceptions for worker's compensation, sickness

6

and disability, that presupposed time lost is

7

covered.

8
9

So I do think that, you know, the
including remuneration paid for time -- time

10

lost, you know, is fairly read as an

11

illustrative example of the broader definition.

12

I'm going to briefly go over the 104

13

argument if I could.

14

the argument that Respondent makes as a backup

15

that, because personal injury awards are

16

excluded from gross income under 104, and an

17

employee is taxed on his or her income, you

18

should take out gross income.

19

going to be able to explain it past that point,

20

but that's the beginning of his argument.

21

Just putting -- this is

And I'm not

The problem with it is, first of all,

22

3201, the tax -- the statute that taxes on

23

income does not use the word gross income.

24

just says income.

25

It

And no matter what word it used, we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

think it just describes the source of the tax.

2

And if you just look at the language, the

3

employee's income has no bearing on either the

4

tax base or the amount of tax owed.

5

describing the source.

6

It's just

And that tax base is identically

7

defined for the employer in Section 3221, so as

8

a textual matter, it can't be different.

9

And, finally, Congress incorporated

10

nine express exclusions from gross income into

11

the definition of compensation, showing

12

Congress knew how to incorporate gross

13

exclusions when they wanted to, and Section 104

14

is not one of them.

15
16

And if I could reserve the remainder
of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

24
25

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
As Respondent now concedes, the Eighth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

Circuit misconstrued the RRTA when it held that

2

compensation includes only payments for hours

3

when the employee is an active server to the

4

employer, a holding that would exclude sick

5

leave, vacation pay, and severance.

6

There are three main sources that each

7

establish that, instead, compensation includes

8

employer payments for hours when an employee is

9

absent from active service, including time

10
11

lost.
Starting with text, the RRTA contains

12

limited exclusions for worker's compensation

13

benefits and for certain types of sickness and

14

disability benefits.

15

superfluous if the term "compensation" only

16

reached payments for periods of active service.

17

Those exclusions would be

As to precedent, since 1946, this

18

Court has construed parallel language in the

19

Social Security Act to reach all payments

20

arising out of the employer/employee

21

relationship, including time lost.

22

And, Justice Kavanaugh, to your

23

question about whether that continues to be

24

good law, this Court reaffirmed that precedent.

25

It applied it in Quality Stores just in 2014.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20

2

And those decisions support also
construing the RRTA to reach time lost.

3

And, third, this interpretation

4

appropriately reflects the interlocking

5

structure of the RRTA and the parallel benefits

6

count as compensation under the RRA, and are

credited towards an employee's retirement

9

benefits.

Time lost payments

Interpreting the RRTA's definition

10

to cover those payments creates symmetry

11

between interrelated tax and benefit

12

provisions.

13

And if I could start by just turning

14

to Justice Gorsuch's question about why it's

15

not different, that this payment is essentially

16

a statutorily-mandated payment that results

17

from a judgment at the end of the day.

18

We think there are two main sources

19

that show that the fact that it's a legal

20

obligation doesn't make a difference.

21

first is in the statutory text, the worker's

22

compensation carveout is really appropriate -­

23

is really important, because it shows that it

24

can be -­

for your friend on the other side.

other one?

4

I've got some questions about that

MS. KOVNER:

What's your

The other one is

5

Nierotko, which also involves essentially a

6

judgment.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me

8

what -- what we should make of the fact that

9

the IRS doesn't appear -- you might correct

10

me -- since 1980 at least, to bring enforcement

11

actions to assess penalties or back-taxes to a

12

railroad employee who has -- who did not

13

withhold a portion of the FELA judgment?

14

MS. KOVNER:

So we don't think that's

15

exactly correct, Justice Sotomayor.

16

think, to understand the IRS's position, the

17

most relevant indicators are, first, the

18

regulations, which have continuously said, you

19

know, time lost payments are covered, since

20

1937, and continues to the present.

21
22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I

You said it, but

you haven't appeared to do much about it.

23

MS. KOVNER:

So I don't think that's

24

the case.

I mean, whenever we've been asked,

25

there's a Technical Advice Memorandum from 1980

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

dealing specifically with FELA judgments

2

saying, again, they have to be paid.

3

I think the difficulty that may arise

4

is these are suits that occur between not the

5

IRS but between a railroad employee and an

6

employer.

7

the other side is asserting is that railroads

8

may essentially not have been complying in some

9

cases, I don't know how many cases, with the

10

And I think what the affidavit on

IRS's regulations.

11

And if that -- if that has happened,

12

it's contrary to our regulations.

13

something we've necessarily known about because

14

it's a suit between a taxpayer and a railroad,

15

and if neither of them reports it, it may be

16

that there are cases where, you know, the IRS

17

hasn't been aware of, hasn't gone after that

18

money.

19

It's not

But the IRS -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the -- the

20

railroad pays -- pays the full tax but charges

21

the -- the railroad worker for his or her

22

share?

23

Is that how it works?
MS. KOVNER:

That's right.

The IRS -­

24

the railroad is required to withhold both -- to

25

withhold from the employee's pay the employee's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1
2

share, and then it pays both shares.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I would be curious,

3

your answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice

4

Kagan's questions earlier.

5

about a general verdict where there's no

6

allocation between what might be later thought

7

by some to be compensation for lost services

8

and other -- other things?

9

pain and suffering, which might be classified

10
11
12
13

So what do we do

What do we do about

as compensation for lost time as well?
What's the government's view on those
complications?
MS. KOVNER:

Yeah.

So, I mean, taking

14

the -- the first question first, the what if

15

there's no allocation, I -- I agree with the

16

articulation by my friend on the railroad side

17

that if there's no allocation at all -- and

18

there's some material that is in the JA,

19

there's sort of detailed guidance on allocation

20

from the RRB -- but I think if there is no

21

allocation, the presumption is it's going to be

22

treated as time lost.

23

I think the RRB says, nonetheless, the

24

employer and the employee are allowed to come

25

in even after the judgment and allocate it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

between time lost and -- and other sources.

2

And we think, you know, that's -­

3

that's what's -- h(2), which is still in the

4

RRA, suggests is the appropriate way to handle

5

this.

6

And I think h(2) is also the part of

7

the answer on pain and suffering.

h(2) clearly

8

contemplates that when you have a judgment,

9

it's going to contain in part taxable payments

10

for time lost and also other kinds of damages

11

and that you're going to need to divide these

12

two things up to figure out, you know, what's

13

compensation.

14

And we think there's a common-sense

15

reason for treating pain and suffering as

16

different, which is lost -- lost time payments

17

are a substitute for something that's taxable.

18

They're a substitute for wages that -- that the

19

employee would have been taxed on.

20

getting credited to your benefits on the RRB

21

side.

And they're

22

In contrast, a pain and suffering

23

judgment is essentially putting you in the

24

place you would be if you hadn't lost some sort

25

of psychic or physical well-being that wouldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

have been taxed.

2

understandable that Congress, in making those

3

sort of changes that make clear that time lost

4

and pain and suffering are treated differently

5

in 1946, we think it's -- it makes sense that

6

Congress thought of these two things as

7

different as one is taxable and one is not.

8
9

So we think it's

And if you look at the history of
those 1946 changes, I think that's -- that's

10

sort of the -- the distinction that's being

11

reflected in the history too.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Kovner, one of the

13

things that strikes me as a little bit odd

14

about an award like this fitting into the

15

"services rendered" language is that, unlike

16

most kinds of compensation that you can think

17

of, you could get this if you were injured your

18

first hour on the job without having worked at

19

all, without having rendered any services at

20

all.

21

MS. KOVNER:

Yeah.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MS. KOVNER:

So what about that?

Well, I think there are a

24

number of forms of compensation that operate

25

like that.

You know, so -- so one example that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

Nierotko gave is something that would be

2

compensation in that it was thinking of is like

3

payment for when you're required to be paid for

4

jury service.

5

would be entitled to on day one.

6

necessarily correlate to hours you work, but

7

it's a benefit you get as an employee.

8

Another example would be like

9

maternity leave, sick leave in certain kinds of

I mean, that's a benefit you
It doesn't

10

circumstances.

11

of benefits that you get as part of your sort

12

of employee compensation that don't exactly

13

correlate to individual hours that you work.

14

I think there are a whole bunch

And even setting aside all these, you

15

know, textual and -- and precedential

16

indicators, you know, we would note that this

17

has been the position of the agency since the

18

statute was enacted in 1937.

19

has amended this statute many times against

20

that backdrop, and it hasn't chosen to change

21

that agency interpretation.

22

Congress amend -­

So we think this is a -- you know, an

23

interpretation that's informed what Congress

24

has done.

25

really make sense unless time lost is covered

It's added exclusions that don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

without changing the agency's interpretation.

2

So, under principles of acquiescence

3

and Chevron deference, if there were ambiguity,

4

we think the agency's interpretation would

5

control.

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

actually don't think there's ambiguity?

8
9

But you

MS. KOVNER:

We don't.

We think this

is a clear case.

10

If there are no further questions, we

11

would ask the judgment below be reversed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

19

At issue in this case is whether the

20

Court construes the statute as it's currently

21

written or whether you construe it the way the

22

other side would like it to read.

23

Our position is that the plain

24

language controls and that the statute now in

25

effect does not contain all the words and extra

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

provisions that get you to a place where

2

"services rendered" means not services

3

rendered, which is the core of the other side's

4

position.

5

"Services rendered" has a very plain

6

meaning.

supervision of another person.

8

9

services.

10

It is providing work under the
When Mr. Loos

That was the whole point of him

bringing his FELA claim.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but he

12

had provide serve -- provided services, and

13

that is what entitled him to the payments that

14

he received.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Incorrect, Mr. Chief

16

Justice.

What entitled him to the payments

17

that he received was that he couldn't work.

18

And it was the railroad's negligence -­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

20

just somebody off the street who couldn't work.

21

It was an employee who couldn't work, and he

22

was an employee because he had rendered

23

services.

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:
rendered the services.

Right.

But he hadn't

That's the whole point.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

He was unable to render the services because he

2

was hurt.

3

So let me explain a little bit about

4

how day call works in a union hall.

5

Mr. Loos was subject under the union terms to

6

be in a union hall, and if he's called in to a

7

crew, he makes money.

Here,

He gets paid for that

If he's unable to make it to the union

10

hall because he's injured, it's considered

11

nothing.

12

doesn't accrue any vacation pay for that.

13

the whole point of the FELA judgment here was

14

that because he was injured, he wasn't able to

15

be in the union hall at the time the railroad

16

called for people to serve on their crews.

17

He doesn't get paid for that, he
And

So, if you were to suppose that

18

Mr. Loos was walking along at the time he was

19

injured and he was with a non-railroad

20

employee, and suppose that non-railroad

21

employee was with a coal company and they both

22

fell into the drainage part -- pit because of

23

the negligence of the railroad, you wouldn't

24

say that the past wages or the lost wages that

25

the coal company employee suffered by the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

railroad's negligence was "for services

2

rendered."

3

There would be no basis for saying that.

You wouldn't say that at all.

4

And so it's odd to suppose that simply

5

because Mr. Loos is capable or subject to being

6

called into a duty status for the crew that you

7

would treat him -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But a lot of these

--

10

MR. FREDERICK:

-- any differently.

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- a lot of these

12

kind of arguments were made in Nierotko, and

13

the Court rejected those in the -- admittedly,

14

in the context of the Social Security Act, but

15

why not follow the same interpretation here?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, what the Court

17

in Nierotko did was it construed the benefits

18

statute.

19

is absolutely clear is that you do not construe

20

the tax statute the same as the benefits

21

statute.

22

And what Cleveland Indians says and

The -- the case of Hisquierdo -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The Cleveland

23

Indians was about the allocation time period.

24

It wasn't about the main holding of Nierotko in

25

terms of how it departed from Nierotko.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

that -­

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Right.

But the

3

interpretive method that the Court employed was

4

different in the sense -­

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

True.

But the

6

precedent on point interprets -- says that time

7

lost is part of services rendered or services

8

performed in the context of the Social Security

9

Act.

10

So why not adhere to that same

interpretation in this context at this point?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Because this Court, to

12

my knowledge, has not ever said that you

13

construe taxing statutes by looking at benefits

14

statutes.

15

Cleveland Indians holds.

16

case of Hisquierdo holds.

directly on point for the Railroad Retirement

about the language in that opinion, which says

that RRTA taxes are to be construed differently

21

than the Railroad Retirement Board benefits.

And that is what -- exactly what
That's also what the
Hisquierdo is

The other side has no discussion

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, your

23

argument would go for the railroad as well as

24

the employee, right?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So this -- this

2

railroad paid a tax that it wasn't required to

3

pay, could it seek a refund?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

And, in fact,

5

the railroad didn't pay the tax until the case

6

was on appeal in the Eighth Circuit.

7

not pay the tax, you know, at the time of the

8

judgment.

15

It did

It waited as a means, presumably, to

appeal.
Now, Justice Gorsuch, I do want to
address your workers' compensation issue.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I was -- I was going

to ask you if you'd volunteer.
MR. FREDERICK:

And -- yes.

There -­

16

there -- let me begin by giving a little bit of

17

history if I could.

18

to most states enacting workers' compensation

19

statutes, and it has been held by this Court to

20

preempt the FELA, to preempt workers'

21

compensation statutes.

22

The FELA was enacted prior

So the only time where there's

23

actually an overlap is where you have a purely

24

-- purely intra-state railroad.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I follow all of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

that.

And your Footnote 9 was excellent in

2

explaining that.

3

remains, if a judgment of an administrative

4

agency in a state setting, in an admittedly

5

intra-state accident is, you would concede, I

6

believe, compensation for wages, then why -­

7

why wouldn't a federal inter-state FELA

8

judgment?

9

But my question still

MR. FREDERICK:

Worker's compensation

10

has always been treated differently in the

11

sense that insure -- the employee and the

12

employer contributes to an insurance fund.

13

It's no fault insurance.

14

And for that reason, it is more, I

15

think, appropriately deemed to be an additional

16

payment that is for services rendered, in the

17

same way that sick pay accumulates over time in

18

-- in the appropriate circumstances.

19

for Mr. Loos.

It didn't

20

But, for vacation pay, if you're a

21

federal employee and you have a 40-hour pay

22

stub and it shows a certain number of hours

23

that you've accrued for vacation pay, those are

24

all for the services that you rendered as an

25

employee.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

Now, with respect to worker's

2

compensation, because it's an insurance scheme

3

that is no fault, it operates in a very

4

different way in terms of how it is funded.

5

There's no pre-funding on the part of the

6

railroad for FELA damages.

7

The whole point of the FELA is to

8

impose a duty of due care on the industry so

9

that workers are not being injured as a result

10

of the railroad's negligence.

11

And that's why Justice Brandeis in the

12

Winfield case in the early 1920s made very

13

clear that an FELA judgment is a penalty for

14

the breach of a duty of due care.

15

And Justice Scalia, in his separate

16

writing in Cleveland Indians, said, in his

17

view, the question is different as to whether

18

or not it is a court-ordered judgment that is

19

not the way you ordinarily think of wages paid,

20

which is the way that the phrase is used under

21

FICA.

22

So, if you look at these textual

23

differences, the line-drawing, I think, Justice

24

Gorsuch, is actually pretty straightforward.

25

You ask the question:

Is the work and the pay

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

here, the compensation, for services rendered?

2

And if it's not, which, clearly, it couldn't be

3

here because Mr. Loos was unable to render

4

services, then it is outside the realm of the

5

RRTA.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you put an

7

awful lot of weight on that, but I can easily

8

imagine an employer explaining how we work in

9

this company.

10

we pay you for services rendered.

11
12

We work in this company is that

By the way, services rendered includes
Christmas Day, though you're not here.

13

By the way, it includes when you have

14

a cold or sick for a few days.

15

we count all that as payment for services

16

rendered.

17

That we -- that

That person is speaking English.
So their first argument is, at the

18

least, it's ambiguous.

19

is go and look at all these changes that

20

happened in the statute over those years.

21

Their second argument

You know what they were arguing about?

22

They were arguing about whether you tax it at

23

the time you would have worked or you tax it

24

when you get it after the judgment now.

25

They never thought you didn't get it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

at all.

And their argument about the two

2

statutes is it's a plus.

3

necessary, but it's a plus to treat the taxing

4

statute symmetrical with.

5

argument is that, hey, 80 years is a long time.

6

We're not saying it's

And their final

Justice Blackmun used to complain

7

about all these changes.

8

years, Congress has done nothing, okay.

9

And, indeed, 80

Now you've responded to some.

I just

10

want to be sure you get a chance to respond to

11

all.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, if I don't get

13

them all in this response, Justice Breyer,

14

please feel free to interrupt me.

15

But, on the history point, the other

16

side, notwithstanding our challenge, cannot

17

give you one instance, not one, where the IRS

18

issued a deficiency notice because there had

19

been a failure to pay RRTA taxes for an FELA

20

judgment.

21

If you look at the Federal Judicial

22

Center's website, there have been something

23

like 71,000 FELA suits filed just since 1970.

24
25

Now, surely, if this had been the way
the taxing service had been construing this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

statute, there would be at least $1 deposited

2

from the Treasury as a result of an FELA

3

judgment and a deficiency notice for a failure

4

to do that.

5

This is all a new argument.

6

reason why the railroad has come up with this

7

new argument is simply to change the settlement

8

dynamics that are going on.

9

those settlement dynamics, they are seeking to

10

impose the in terrorem threat of a taxation on

11

the employee at the time when there's a

12

negotiation.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FREDERICK:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

And by changing

I'm sorry.

Explain that to me.

15

17

And the

Sure.
What -- what are

they going to do?
MR. FREDERICK:

What they -- when

19

there's a settlement negotiation, Justice

20

Sotomayor, the question is will you -- will we

21

pay you now for your range of damages or will

22

you run the risk of going to court.

23

part of that calculus, the question is whether

24

or not taxes would be owed and owing on that.

25

And as

And if the taxes are not owed and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

owing because it is a judgment, then that is

2

for the workers' favor in terms of considering

3

whether or not to settle the case.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

5

There's a settlement under a FELA action, X

6

amount of money.

7

something, correct?

8
9

It has to be attributed to
Are you saying -­

MR. FREDERICK:
actually.

No, it doesn't,

There -- there, I don't understand

10

their textual argument for that at all because

11

what they're asking for you to do is to accept

12

the idea that the Railroad Retirement Board

13

somehow has the administrative authority to

14

construe a taxing statute.

been the case where you have a benefit agency

construing the taxing statute.

18

And that's never

The taxing

Now, if you look at the sources in our

19

Footnotes 2, 3, and 4 in our brief, they make

20

very clear that the IRS in -- in -- in

21

interpretations that post-date the sources that

22

they're talking about here say that when

23

there's a personal injury award, it is not

24

subject to income tax.

25

And in the first one, the citation

that the -- under the code, Section 6110(k)(3)

cited as precedent, which is probably why that

14

Technical Advice Memorandum isn't cited in the

15

Solicitor General's brief, although counsel

16

today has invoked that as supposed authority.

17

But I would point out, secondly, that

18

this TAM, this 1980 reference, concerns a

19

version of the statute that no longer exists.

20

It was part of the statute -- it was construing

21

a statute that was in effect up until 1975.

22

And, Justice Kavanaugh, you're

23

correct, at that time, that's when the time

24

lost language was taken out of the statute.

25

That 1980 TAM was construing the previous

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

version of the statute that doesn't exist

2

anymore.

3

So, for purposes of understanding

4

where there has been consistency or

5

inconsistency, there's been rank inconsistency

6

because the IRS has -- has said different

7

things in different means that are entitled to

8

different levels of respect.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so -­
Why -- why do you

10

think the language was taken out?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

I think it -- there -­

12

it's actually a good question, Justice

13

Ginsburg.

14

The intimation in the railroad's brief

15

here is that the railroad thought it would be

16

easier to administer without having that

17

language.

18

But there is no -- there are no

19

statements of or legislative history that would

20

suggest exactly why.

21

the reason why the time lost language had been

22

added was to implement what was called the

23

Washington agreement in the late '30s.

24
25

One theory could be that

And the Washington agreement was a
deal struck between rail labor and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

railroads with the idea of treating what was

2

going on at the time in the industry of a lot

3

of unsettle -- unsettlement, where workers who

4

had been working for one railroad were part of

5

-- got caught up in the mergers.

6

ability to maintain higher-paying jobs.

7

the Washington agreement was to deal with what

8

were called displacement allowances.

9

They lost the
And

These displacement allowances were

10

defined to be time lost in that era.

11

could very well have been that, by the 1970s,

12

this whole reason for that concept had -- was

13

no longer in effect.

14
15

And it

Now the issue in that 1980 technical
advice memorandum -­

16

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, it's because

17

the time allocation was changed.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you're talking

19

about -- you're -- I think you're making

20

reference, Your Honor, to the paid versus

21

earned -­

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

-- distinction?
Yes.

But that -- whether

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

the timing thing had happened as a change

2

didn't affect what was being taxed, which was

3

services rendered.

4

So whether you tax -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I understand that.

5

But it changed -- you didn't need the language

6

anymore, is -- is the argument, right?

7

"time lost" language anymore -- because the -­

8

the allocation had changed?

9
10
11
12

MR. FREDERICK:

The

Well -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

At least that's

the argument.
MR. FREDERICK:

-- their argument goes

13

beyond that, Justice Kavanaugh, and that's when

14

they are saying that the words "including time

15

lost" somehow make "services rendered" mean not

16

services rendered because time lost is somehow

17

an example or an illustration of the concept of

18

services rendered.

19

As a matter of plain English, that

20

makes absolutely no sense.

And we've given a

21

bunch of statutory examples in our brief of

22

where Congress would use the word "including"

23

to be additive, like in the Longshore Act,

24

where the situs requirement is imposed on the

25

navigable waters, including piers.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

Now I don't think anybody in this room

2

today would think that a pier is a navigable

3

water, but yet that's how Congress chose to

4

express itself.

5

that the idea of time lost under no reasonable

6

understanding of the English language would be

7

services rendered either.

8
9

And it -- and I would submit

So what you're left with here is what
the Eighth Circuit deemed to be a very clear

10

statute where the taxation that was sought to

11

be imposed here was on a -- an FELA judgment

12

rather than on what services were rendered.

13

And one other note about the Eighth

14

Circuit panel.

15

Central just last term, construed the earlier

16

part of that provision, the money remuneration.

17

The Eighth Circuit panel that decided this case

18

also had decided a case called Union Pacific,

19

which handled the exact question at issue in

20

Wisconsin Central, and decided it correctly, as

21

this Court opined.

22

This Court, in Wisconsin

It was the same panel that handled

23

both issues.

And this Court cited with

24

approval the Union Pacific decision.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Now we -­

I thought a key

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

move in the Eighth Circuit decision was

2

interpreting Nierotko, and then it said we

3

recently determined that that definition can't

4

be imported into the RRTA because the FICA tax

5

is payment for employment, which is defined

6

broadly.

7

services performed, which is equivalent, the

8

argument is, to services rendered.

9

But, in fact, Nierotko does go to

So how do you respond to that part

10

when you rely on the Eighth Circuit so

11

specifically?

12

That sentence jumps out at me.

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, again, it goes

13

to the difference between benefits and taxes

14

and the asymmetry there.

15

take -­

16
17
18

If you were to

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's not what

they were relying on.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, no, but what

19

they were -- what -- I think that what -- they

20

were actually relying on the fact that there is

21

an asymmetry between benefits and taxation.

22

And if you take that asymmetry -- let's -­

23

let's just play this out a little bit.

24
25

If you're a rail worker and you work
for four years and 11 months, you paid your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

RRTA taxes, you do not qualify for benefits

2

under the Railroad Retirement Act because you

3

haven't hit the first five-year threshold.

4

it is clear from that example that there's an

5

asymmetry between the taxing provision on the

6

one hand and the benefits provision on the

7

other hand.

8
9

So

Justice Kagan, you mentioned the idea
of just starting out.

Imagine the system as it

10

was -- existed in 1937, where you had literally

11

thousands of railmen who were retiring or

12

unable to work and they were now all of a

13

sudden getting benefits, but there were no tax

14

revenues at that time that was sufficient to

15

pay the benefits.

16

So there's always been an asymmetry

17

between the taxing provision and the benefits

18

provision.

19

to bootstrap the words that are in the benefits

20

provision that no longer exist in the taxing

21

provision and to give those words meaning where

22

Congress intentionally deleted those words.

23

Now, if I could talk for a moment,

And what they're seeking to do is

24

Justice Sotomayor, about your administrability

25

problem.

There absolutely is a problem with a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

general verdict because, in many states, there

2

are general verdict forms and this award would

3

be for all manner of things.

4

But the administrability problems

5

actually go a little bit further than that,

6

because, in the case of Norfolk and Western

7

versus Liepelt, which we cite in our brief but

8

the other side does not, this Court held that

9

juries are required to give -- be given

10

instructions that the awards that they give

11

under the FELA are not subject to income tax.

12

Why is that important?

The railroad

13

asked for that instruction in the Liepelt case

14

because it didn't want juries inflating awards

15

because the jury would understand that if a -­

16

a cache of money is being paid out to the

17

worker, it would be subject to tax.

18

was leading the railroad to assert that these

19

awards are being inflated improperly because

20

juries thought that these were going to be

21

taxable awards.

22

And that

So this instruction is given in every

23

-- in most every FELA case that I'm aware of.

24

And it was given in this one.

25

Joint Appendix at page 91.

It's in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

That instruction given to the jury is

2

that the FELA award here is not going to be

3

subject to income tax.

4

about administrability problems, not only do

5

you have a problem with the general verdict,

6

but you have a problem with what would be

7

colliding opinions of this Court if you were to

8

accept what the railroad is arguing for here.

9

So you want to talk

On the one hand, the jury is told your

10

damages verdict is not going to be subject to

11

income tax, but if you award some part for past

12

earnings loss, that will be subject to the RRTA

13

tax.

14

out, on the basis of these conflicting

15

instructions, how much to inflate the award to

16

cover the retirement tax part of it.

17

So the jury is somehow supposed to figure

But, wait, it gets more complicated

18

than that because there are two different tax

19

rates for the railroad retirement tax.

20

Tier 1, which are more or less equivalent to

21

the kind of Social Security taxes that we're

22

familiar with under FICA.

23

There's

But there's Tier 2.

Tier 2 are more like private pensions,

24

and the rate of tax changes on that every year

25

based on the assets that have accumulated under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

the control of the Railroad Retirement Board.

2

So not only are you going to be asking

3

juries to try to figure out somehow what tax

4

rate to apply to cover this little sliver of

5

lost wage earnings, but you're going to have to

6

impose on courts the duty of keeping track

7

every year, as soon as the Railroad Retirement

8

Board resets the rate for the Tier 2 tax -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're speculating

10

that juries are aware of railroad retirement

11

benefits and taxation.

12

quite right when you say you didn't want to

13

inflate verdicts to account for income tax.

14

The -- I think you're

But what is the likelihood that a jury

15

is going to think of railroad retirement

16

benefits?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

The point, Justice

18

Ginsburg, and -- and this is where I think

19

looking again at this Court's decision in

20

Norfolk and Western versus Liepelt is

21

instructive, because, there, if the -- if this

22

is fair game, then why wouldn't it be possible

23

for the worker's lawyer to say, now this -- one

24

part of it's going to be subject to tax, and

25

ask for an instruction that the jury give the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

after-tax amount that would equate to the lost

2

earnings portion of the judgment.

3

And therein lies the rub, Justice

4

Ginsburg, because, if the lawyers are going to

5

be debating about how the jury is instructed,

6

it surely is fair game for the jury to

7

understand exactly what the law is.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

And -­

And has any jury

ever been instructed -- has any railroad

10

attorney asked for a jury instruction about

11

railroad retirement tax?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

No, because it's never

13

been taxed before.

14

This whole idea came up five years ago when the

15

BNSF Railroad asked the Railroad Retirement

16

Board for gratuitous advice about whether or

17

not these awards could be taxed.

18

started up a process of litigating this issue.

19

That's the whole point.

And then they

If you look at all the reported

20

decisions, they all arise in the last couple of

21

years, notwithstanding the fact that, for 75

22

years, from the inception of the railroad

23

retirement system, there were -- this was not

24

an issue.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, because it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

wasn't a -- look, the way I'm thinking about

2

it, and perhaps you'll tell me my -- that I'm

3

wrong, but very -- very simply, Congress has

4

loads of statutes spending money.

5

of think, a lot of people think, what they

6

spend money on has to be paid for.

7

people think that taxes is a good way to do it.

8
9

And I sort

And many

So, other things being equal -- and
there are a lot of other things -- to make

10

these statutes work in harmony, so you tax what

11

you're going to get later paid for is a virtue.

12

Now Congress suddenly changed the

13

practice, in your view, because it had been

14

there since 1937, by amending these statutes.

15

So we have a slight virtue on one side which

16

raises a question.

Why?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

19

20

benefits that he hasn't paid for.

course.

Justice Breyer, let me
We're not

He doesn't

No, I understand

But you also understand the asymmetry
And there are other asymmetries, of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

I'm just saying -- I don't want to

2

repeat myself.

I'm just saying my real

3

question here -- and I -- I wanted you to get

4

narrow on it and that's why I asked it -- why?

5

Why would -- did Congress want to change it?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9
10

I think that -­
In your view.
In my view, the

reason -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

We've been quiet

11

about it, by the way, nobody saying a word, but

12

-- and it being nearly years and years and

13

years of the other thing, and then they

14

suddenly changed it, and in your view, why?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

I think the reason is

16

that it had very little practical effect

17

because taxes were not being generated on these

18

awards, and there was no real question about

19

the benefits that were -- that were accruing.

20

In most instances, the only time when

21

the benefits side actually matters for these

22

awards is when you can allocate dollars for a

23

few months in order to get beyond the 20-year

24

threshold or the 30-year threshold.

25

happen very often.

It doesn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

And it -- when it does happen, a

2

practice has developed where the worker

3

actually pays for those topped-up months.

4

So take, for instance, a worker who's

5

got 19 years and 10 months of service.

6

hurt on the job.

7

He gets his FELA judgment.

8
9

He gets

It's the railroad's fault.

What that 1980 tax memorandum was
talking about, the employee went forward and

10

said:

11

to get credit for two months so that I can get

12

my 20 years for my service.

13

I'm willing to pay my taxes.

And the IRS said:

I'd like

That's okay.

And

14

that had been the way the statute was worded

15

between 1946 and 1975.

16

Now I understand that, since 1975,

17

this informal practice has continued.

18

used very often.

19

situation where you've got workers that are out

20

there getting benefits based on these judgments

21

because the judgments typically don't allocate

22

to particular months.

23

It's not

But we're not talking about a

And if you do not allocate the

24

back-pay award to particular months, then the

25

Railroad Retirement Board doesn't have a basis

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

for saying how you count it up toward the -­

2

the creditable service.

3

And because the way the benefits work,

4

it doesn't typically benefit you to have 18

5

years of service or 17 years of service.

6

You've got to get to 20 years now in order to

7

get to a new threshold.

8
9
10

This matter as a practical thing,
Justice Breyer, simply was not deemed to be so
significant as to affect things.

11

I would further point out, as the

12

Board, the Railroad Retirement Board's latest

13

annual report indicates, the retirement system

14

is going to be solvent for the next 29 years.

15

You've got to ask the question:

What

16

difference does it make whether or not you

17

impose the tax, except as a means of altering

18

the bargaining leverage between the railroads

19

and their workers, when the railroads have

20

breached the duty of due care and caused injury

21

to their workers.

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

Justice Ginsburg, on your jury

instruction point, I -- I don't think there's

8

anything in the history of American

9

jurisprudence that you get an instruction under

10

FICA that you get to tell the jury to gross-up.

you'd be even entitled to that instruction.

instruction requiring the jury to -- to

MS. BLATT:

MS. BLATT:

4

Sure, if someone wants to

No court has bought it.
But I think the reason why in Liepelt

5

is because there was like a, I don't know,

taxes make up, like, 30, 40 percent, and so the

And I just have

What -- what do you

14

say to Mr. Frederick's point that the reason

15

why the railroad's so interested in this is to

16

increase its leverage in settlement

17

negotiations, where the parties can allocate

18

awards, and -- and here you're arguing pretty

19

strenuously that they shouldn't be able to -­

20

to -- to -- to be -- to take into cognizance

21

the tax issue on -- in -- in a jury judgment?

22

MS. BLATT:

Right.

23

I told you why we're here.

24

leverage.

25

I -- I mean, I -­
It is not to gain

The one thing I didn't say, or I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

thought I said, but apparently I didn't, was

2

that the railroads are very concerned that the

3

rates are going to go up.

4

mismatch, they're directly -- you know, they

5

pay two-thirds of any rate increase.

6

If there's a

But, on the settlement leverage,

7

whatever you think happens about allocation -­

8

and this goes to you, Justice Sotomayor -­

9

regardless of what you do in this case, 231 for

10

the benefits side requires allocation in every

11

case for personal injury judgment.

12

Now, if we prevail, whatever happens

13

in terms of allocation on the taxing side, it

14

is treated with parity on the benefits side.

15

And that is to say, if employees are

16

underreporting their taxes, they're going to

17

get an underreporting in benefits.

18

If they win, there is no downside, and

19

the law allows them to allocate an entire award

20

to the benefits side, without any tax burden.

21

So I think we win in terms of the dynamic to

22

the net benefit on Treasury.

23

If you're worried about settlement

24

dynamics, I mean, that is because of the h -­

25

h(2), h(2), yes, in 231 allows employees to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57

allocate.

2

The third thing, I do want to defend

3

the government here, because -- about this 1981

4

TAM.

5

cite it is because it wasn't until the red

6

brief that made all this huge thing about, oh,

7

80 years and 80 years, so, I mean, the

8

government wasn't aware it was going to be

9

accused of any of this when they had a

The reason probably the government didn't

10

regulation on point that said any amounts paid

11

for time lost.

12

So we cited it in our brief.

And also, on the time lost, the bottom

13

line of where I want to end, I mean, the

14

problem for the other side, whatever he wants

15

to say about the language, he concedes time

16

lost payments are covered.

17

I mean, in one part of his argument,

18

he fought it.

19

he has to concede it because he concedes that

20

vacation pay, sickness, I mean, whether or not

21

he wants to admit it, you don't work on

22

Christmas Day, and that's considered time lost,

23

and you -- that's for services rendered.

24
25

In another part of the argument,

So the only thing, what his case comes
down to is whether a negligence judgment is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

somehow different from the type of payments

2

that he concedes.

3

And we don't think there's any textual

4

or purposeful and, you know, in any event, I

5

hate to cite it, but I will end with Chevron.

I mean, he has to win under the plain language

for you to affirm.
