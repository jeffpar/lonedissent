CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Berryhill.

6

Mr. Ortiz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ORTIZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This case turns on the meaning of two

12

words in Section 406(b), "such representation."

13

Do they refer to work done only before the

14

court, the only representation discussed in

15

Section 406(b) itself, or do they also include

16

work done before the agency, which is subject

17

to a separate award mechanism in Section

18

406(a)?

19

In this case, Your Honors, the

20

statute's text, its structure, its purposes,

21

and its history all confirm that Section

22

406(b)'s cap applies only to work done in

23

court.

24
25

First, the text:

Section 406(b)

references explicitly and only work done in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

court.

2

whenever a court renders a judgment favorable

3

to a claimant who is represented before the

4

court by an attorney, the court may allow a

5

reasonable fee for such representation.

6

It's a single sentence.

It says

The dictionary meaning of the word

7

"such," of the sort previously mentioned,

8

confirms what is commonsensical.

9

doctrine of the canon of expressio unius.

So does the

10

Section 406(a), by contrast, speaks of work

11

done before the commissioner.

12

speaks only of work done before the court.

13

Section 406(b)

Congress also, Your Honor, knew how to

14

create an aggregate cap if it wanted to.

15

Section 406(a)(2)(C), it creates an aggregate

16

cap for claims in cases involving both claims

17

under Title 2 and Title 16, and it uses the

18

words "in the aggregate."

19

Congress likewise knew how to create

20

offsets, as it did in the Equal Access to

21

Justice Act.

22

In

Also, Your Honors, the structure of

23

the Act makes this clear.

In Gisbrecht, this

24

Court defined -- said that the statute handles

25

discretely claims for work before the agency

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

and claims before the court.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can I ask you a

3

question about the -- the cap?

4

there's a cap in (b) and that applies to court

5

services, not to services before the agency.

6

You're saying

But is there a -- a cap on the amount

7

that can be taken from the plaintiff's

8

recovery?

9

agree with you that the (b) cap is for court

That is, let's say that we -- we

10

only.

11

services.

12

plaintiff's recovery than, what is it,

13

25 percent?

14

It doesn't apply to administrative
Can more be taken from the

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

15

agency has taken the position, which is not

16

contested in this litigation, that there's a

17

separate 25 percent pay cap which applied.

18

They will set aside the amount of past-due

19

benefits and withhold the 25 percent for the

20

payment of attorney's fees under both 406(b)

21

and 406(a).

22
23
24
25

The

So that is an upward limit in this
case.

This case -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

question about that.

I do have a

I'm troubled by the idea

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

of attorneys attempting to collect fees

2

directly from their clients.

3

Now I understand from the briefing

4

that you can't garnish disability benefits, so

5

if you don't get paid your percentage, you

6

can't garnish disability benefits.

7

you collect otherwise?

8

the fund that Justice Ginsburg is describing.

9

MR. ORTIZ:

10

But how can

You don't collect over

No, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The retained

11

amount.

12

have wanted Social Security recipients to be

13

hounded by collection efforts?

14

Don't you think that Congress wouldn't

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, first, I

15

want to correct what may be a misconception.

16

It is not the case that when the 25 percent

17

authorization cap is used up, that attorneys,

18

if they want to recover fees beyond that, would

19

-- beyond the amount withheld, would actually

20

have to go against the claimant directly.

21

In any case, when there is an EAJA

22

award, as there are in over 40 percent of these

23

cases, and the EAJA award is equal to or

24

exceeds the 406(a) award, the attorney can

25

actually get the money from the amount that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

agency is still withholding.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I understood here

3

there was some EAJA money that you could have

4

received.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Yeah.

So in this -­
But I'm talking

about the extreme possibility -­

8

MR. ORTIZ:

Yeah.

In this -­
-- where there's a

10

small EAJA award, but you get 50 percent of the

11

recovery.

13

that belongs to clients?

14

MR. ORTIZ:

15

Honor.

16

sense.

17
18

Are we going to have people

Not in most cases, Your

In most cases, it makes no economic

about most cases.

I'm not asking

I'm asking about exceptions.

19

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, there would be an -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. ORTIZ:

When -­

There would be an

22

exception, Your Honor, if I were representing

23

Bill Gates, say.

24

him for payment of the remaining fee.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It would -- I could go after

But most of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

claimants are, of course -- do not have much

2

money, and the statute, as Justice Ginsburg

3

says, puts a 25 percent cap on what -- on how

4

it's going to -- the pool, I guess, is the -­

5

from which it's going to be paid by the agency.

6

Doesn't that suggest that Congress

7

thought that there would be an aggregate cap

8

because, A, there is the pool cap, and then, as

9

Justice Sotomayor says, we don't expect lawyers

10

to go after claimants who, by definition, often

11

can't work and often don't have much money?

12

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

13

the pool cap is a matter -- is a creature of

14

agency work, not actually an artifact of what

15

Congress has done.

16

impute that actually to what Congress -- what

17

Congress's feeling here was.

18

So it's -- you cannot

As you mentioned, in most cases -- in

19

many of these cases, the claimant will be

20

judgment-proof beyond the amount that the

21

agency has set aside.

22

circumstances, it makes no sense for the

23

attorney to go after the claimant.

And in those

24

The claimant -- the attorney -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the answer -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

the answer is, am I right, that, look, for what

2

-- in an EAJA case, where you collect the money

3

from the government, the lawyer gets money

4

from -- he takes the fee out of that, is that

5

right?

6

MR. ORTIZ:

The -- the attorney has to

7

effectively return the lesser of the EAJA fee

8

or the 406(b) -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So if -- if

10

the amount from the client is less than the

11

EAJA award, the attorney gets the -- the

12

greater amount and returns the other to the

13

client, so the client doesn't pay, okay,

14

anything perhaps.

15

take that out of the picture, and you win this

16

case, there's yet another check that has to be

17

a reasonable fee, and the -- the judge is in

18

charge of that.

If there's no EAJA award, so

19

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Okay.

So

21

it has to escape that.

22

that, then the lawyer can get up to 50 percent.

23

That's the answer, is that right?

24
25

MR. ORTIZ:

But, if it does escape

The lawyer can be

authorized for 50 percent.

And then you could bring it up to

13

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And your argument

15

against that is that's like the null set,

16

unless Gates happens to be on welfare, which I

17

think he isn't.

18

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes.

Well, it would make

19

no sense for an attorney to waste his or her

20

time pursuing such claimants, go -- go after

21

people who are essentially judgment-proof, Your

Honor.

The amicus's brief -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a question

2

that bothers me greatly about this whole

3

litigation.

4

contrary to your client's interests, meaning

5

your client under no circumstance should want

6

the danger of paying more than the 25 percent

7

aggregate.

8

different lawyer for her in some point in this

9

litigation earlier than here?

10

It seems like your interests are

So shouldn't you have gotten a

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor.

Our

11

client has actually been notified every step

12

along the way about what -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not true

14

consent.

15

judge, you had to not only advise her but

16

advise her of the potential conflict and advise

17

her to seek separate counsel.

18

MR. ORTIZ:

19
20

At least when I was a district court

Was that done?

I don't believe that that

was done in this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I am troubled

21

by these fee disputes because I want -- often

22

wonder if clients are being adequately

23

represented once the dispute moves from the

24

main case and into how much you're entitled to.

25

MR. ORTIZ:

But, in this case, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

Honor, not only was Ms. Wood informed of what

2

was happening, but she had consented to it.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not without being

told of the potential conflict.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

6

much it was explained to her.

7

I don't know in-depth how

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Practically -­

8

practically, where would you -- you can't get

9

money out of the Social Security benefits, if

10

-- if they've been exhausted under -- under (b)

11

for the court work.

12

get -- to get that -- to get more than

13

25 percent, not from Social Security benefits,

14

but some other source?

15

MR. ORTIZ:

So where would you go to

Your Honor, if there are

16

no EAJA fees in the picture, which would

17

increase the size, effectively increase the

18

size of the pot, and the claimant can't pay any

19

more money, you would take your lumps and

20

leave.

21

the loss in fees, is typically what happens.

22
23
24
25

The lawyer at that point would swallow

There's no sense in wasting time
trying to squeeze blood from a turnip.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, wouldn't that

-- if that's the general case, then what are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

the practical consequences of our agreeing with

2

your position when you can't get more than

3

25 percent out of the Social Security benefits

4

themselves?

5

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, the practical

6

implications of the aggregate cap rule, Your

7

Honor, is that attorneys will be less willing

8

to take on these cases ex-ante because they

9

will understand that in many cases they will

10

not be getting fees for work in court because

11

that pool will have been expanded -- expended.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many cases

have EAJA awards?

14

MR. ORTIZ:

In Gisbrecht, Your Honor,

15

the concurrence mentioned that it was

16

41 percent.

17

up-to-date statistics are above 40 percent to

18

50 percent, somewhere in there.

19

It's our understanding that more

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So in about 40 to

20

50 percent of the cases there will always be a

21

pot bigger than the 25 percent?

22

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -­

That's what you're

24

fighting for, is that 25 percent that -- that

25

--

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, but the aggregate

2

rule does not allow the attorney access to any

3

of that.

4

we're advocating does.

The non-aggregate approach which

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. ORTIZ:

Does.

So even under -- so under

7

the aggregate rule, that extra money under EAJA

8

is simply unavailable to the attorney.

9

straight -- all of it would go straight to the

10

It goes

client.

11

Under our approach, that attorney -­

12

that -- the EAJA award is effectively split and

13

divided between the claimant and the attorney.

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

(a)(4), I thought,

15

established a 25 percent cap on the pool, the

16

statute itself.

17

the statute.

18
19

Maybe I'm misreading something.

MR. ORTIZ:
unclear, Your Honor.

20
21

You said it didn't come from

No, (a)(4) is a little bit
(a)(4) talks about the -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
very clear.

22

Well, it seems

It says 25 percent.

MR. ORTIZ:

No, it does say

23

25 percent.

But it also says the maximum fee,

24

which is -- is a technical term for the agency

25

award.

The maximum fee is not a term from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1
2

406(b).

It's from 406(a).
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But that -- that

3

pool established under (a)(4) is the only pool,

4

that Justice Ginsburg has been referencing,

5

that's the only pool, correct?

6
7
8
9
10

MR. ORTIZ:

That is the only pool.

The agency doesn't -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's capped, the

pool is capped by statute at 25 percent?
MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor.

The pool

11

-- the pool is capped with respect to 406(b)

12

awards at overall -- at an overall of

13

25 percent by the agency.

14

Mr. Yang can perhaps answer this better.

15

I believe my friend

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The regulations

16

interpreting that do cap the pool then at

17

25 percent as well?

18

MR. ORTIZ:

They do.

But I believe

19

that the -- the -- the support in the statute

20

that they point to for that is not anything in

21

406(a) but is actually 406(b)'s language where

22

it says that a -- that the commissioner may

23

award -- it's in 406, it's on page 8(a) of the

24

government's opening merits brief.

25

halfway down (b) it says:

About

And the Commissioner

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

of Social Security may, notwithstanding -­

2

there's a Section 401(i) that's titled but

3

subject to subsection D -- certify the amount

4

of such fee for -- for payment to such attorney

5

out of and not in addition to the amount of

6

such past-due benefits.

7

And the agency has taken the view that

8

that gives it the authority, discretionary

9

authority to cap the overall pool that's

10

available for 406(b) awards as well.

11

Your Honors, the -- the -- if I may,

12

Your Honors, I would like to reserve my

13

remaining time for rebuttal.

23

Mr. Yang.

BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, IN SUPPORT OF

20
21

Thank you.

REVERSAL AND REMAND
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There is one and only one operative

24

provision in this case, and it's Section

25

406(b)(1)(A).

That provision applies when a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

claimant is represented, "represented before

2

the court by an attorney," and it authorizes a

3

reasonable fee for such representation.

4

That provision clearly governs fees

5

only for representations before the court, and

6

its 25 percent past-due benefits cap likewise

7

only applies to fees for work done before the

8

court.

9

That text fully resolves this case.
The Court has had a series of

10

questions about kind of some of the

11

practicalities.

12

Justice Kavanaugh's question about the pot.

13

I'd like to address first

There's actually two statutory

14

provisions.

15

at page 7a of our brief.

16

Secretary shall certify for payment out of

17

past-due benefits so much of the maximum fee as

18

does not exceed 25 percent.

19

if you look throughout the prior provisions of

20

(a), talk about the maximum fee that the

21

commissioner approves for work before the

22

agency.

23

The first is at (a)(4). (a)(4) is
That says that the

The maximum fee,

So that (a)(4) provision mandates that

24

so much of that maximum fee, that is, the

25

agency fee, as does not exceed 25 percent shall

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

be paid.

2

It's mandatory.
Now I think there's two things.

3

is the mandatory.

4

at least, if the agency fee is that large.

5

First

The pot must be 25 percent,

And, two, the language "so much of the

6

agency fee as does not exceed" emphasizes that

7

Congress understood that the agency fee could

8

and would sometimes exceed 25 percent of

9

past-due benefits, which itself is incompatible

10

with an aggregate 25 percent.

11
12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

A different

argument, but -­

13

MR. YANG:

Different argument, but

14

while we're on (a)(4) I thought I'd touch upon

15

it.

16

The second provision is in (b)(1).

17

That's on page 8a.

18

the main paragraph, that the Secretary shall

19

certify the amount of such fee, referring back

20

to the court-approved fee for court work, as

21

does not -- out of and not in addition to the

22

amount of past-due benefits.

23

It's in the latter half of

That is in the permissive.

24

certify.

25

the mandatory obligation to set aside

It is may

So the -- the agency has interpreted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

25 percent for agency fees, and the permissive

2

obligation or the permissive authority to set

3

aside money for the court fee, which itself is

4

capped at 25 percent, as allowing it to only

5

pay out 25 percent -­

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

7

MR. YANG:

8

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

9

understand that.

Right.

-- total.
Right.

I

And it comes ultimately from

10

an interpretation of the statute.

11

saying it's not mandated by the statute.

12

MR. YANG:

Maybe you're

Well, it's an -- an

13

interpretation of the permissive part of the

14

statute.

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Right, that's what

16

I mean by saying it's not -- maybe it's not

17

mandated by the statute, is your point.

18

MR. YANG:

So it's not -- so -- but

19

when Congress was enacting these provisions and

20

any cap that might exist, Congress understood

21

that it was authorizing the agency to withhold

22

more than 25 percent with the operation of

23

these two.

24
25

There's another point to be made that
I think we haven't focused on, is that we've

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

only been talking about attorney fees because

2

this case involves an attorney, but Congress

3

has authorized non-attorneys to represent

4

agency -- clients before the agency, and in

5

subsection (e) of 406, specifically directs the

6

agency to extend the fee payment provisions,

7

the direct payment provisions that we're

8

talking about in (a)(4), to non-attorneys.

9

But in doing so, Congress in (e)(2) -­

10

unfortunately, we didn't reproduce this in our

11

brief, but it's in (e)(2) -- set forth

12

prerequisites for these non-attorney

13

representatives to be eligible for this direct

14

payment.

15

eligible -- eligibility requirements.

16

Not all of them meet those

So there is a category of cases that

17

(a)(4) never comes into play because there's no

18

authority to provide direct payment to the -­

19

to the representative.

20

representatives are still representing clients

21

before the Social Security Administration, and

22

they have to collect their fees or they

23

wouldn't be doing it.

24
25

Now those

And I think that addresses, Justice
Sotomayor, your concern.

It's baked into the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

system that these representatives are going to

2

collect sometimes the fees from the client.

3

Now these -- in Social Security Title 2 cases,

4

there's no -- there's no means testing.

5

can have a rich client; you can have a poor

client.

say there's no danger or little danger of

first of all, no one has questioned the

government's authority where the government has

already paid the money that should not have

from individuals.

provisions that govern that to make sure that

the recoupment of this overpayment is not

In -- in most contexts, the

I -- I don't find that to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1
2

onerous.
But, again, getting back to the

3

question presented in this case, I think it's

4

-- it's clear that Congress contemplated, if

5

you look at (a)(5), which is the criminal

6

prohibition for collecting in excess of the

7

maximum fee authorized by the Commissioner, or

8

(b)(2), which is the criminal prohibition

9

prohibiting collection of the fee beyond that

10

authorized by the court, by setting a criminal

11

prohibition and setting the threshold beyond

12

what's authorized, Congress contemplated that,

13

if it's under that authorization limit, you

14

could collect it.

15

And it's not an abusive collection

16

because the fees have been approved either by

17

the agency under 406(a) or under the court

18

under 406(b).

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You -- you

20

obviously have a good textual argument.

I

21

think the point is your brief then goes to

22

great lengths to say don't worry about taking

23

50 percent from disability claimants because

24

district courts won't allow that under the

25

reasonableness prong.

And the -- the amicus

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25

brief of disability attorneys say don't worry

2

about that seemingly extreme 50 percent fee

3

because that never really happens in practice.

4

Both of which suggest that this system was not

5

designed to be one where you're getting

6

50 percent.

7
8

MR. YANG:
entirely true.

9
10

I don't think that's

The thing is we -- we -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Right.

15

MR. YANG:

But -- but the -- I think

16

on the policy, there are going to be cases

17

where you're going to get greater than

18

25 percent.

19

where there's representation in an overpayment

20

case, as we were just discussing.

21

For instance, there are cases

Well, maybe you get -- and as a result

22

of an overpayment case, you don't get past-due

23

benefits, but the agency and the court may well

24

approve a reasonable fee for payment in such

25

cases.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think the import

9

of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the

10

usual case in which there are proceedings both

11

at the Commission and at a district court, and

12

there are two 25 percent caps, it -- it's -­

13

it's not the government's position that in that

usual case where lawyers can say, well, I won

15

here and I won there, that both of them are

16

entitled to 25 percent fees or that both of

17

them should get 25 percent fees.

18

MR. YANG:

In a normal case where

19

you've got a substantial amount of past-due

20

benefits, we think that's not the case.

21

there are smaller amounts of past-due benefits,

22

if there's only, say, $5,000 of past-due

23

benefits, we're only -- we're talking about

24

very small amounts of compensation for

25

attorneys.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

When

And it's important to recognize also

that we're only talking about the past-due

benefits.

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

MR. YANG:

6

What -­

For a disability complaint

--

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't -- I think,

8

you know, what strikes me as -- as, you know,

9

troublesome about this, and then you could add

10

a court of appeals proceeding to it and the

11

possibility of 75 percent fees.

12

could that possibly have been what Congress

13

wanted?

14

MR. YANG:

So, you know,

Well, I guess there's two

15

points.

16

about past-due benefits, but Congress would

17

have understood that for a disabled person and

18

particularly one who is permanently disabled,

19

ongoing future benefits, which are untouched by

20

this cap, are protected.

21

protected them under 407.

22

One, Congress was concerned not only

And, in fact, they

The second point is I think you raised

23

the question of 75 percent.

The government's

24

view is that the cap in (b), 406(b), is

25

25 percent for all of the court proceedings,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1
2

including appeals.
And there's multiple reasons for that.

3

We think the text, when read in light of the

4

Dictionary Act, is amenable to that reading.

5

But, if you took the opposite reading, you

6

could have four, five, six proceedings with

7

multiple remands, coming up to this Court

8

perhaps, there's no way you can get more than

9

100 percent of past-due benefits if there are

10
11

five proceedings.
So that anomaly suggests that our

12

reading of a 25 percent aggregate cap for the

13

judicial proceedings is what was intended by

14

Congress in 406(b), which would then suggest

15

that normally, although there's not always -­

16

it's not always the case because sometimes

17

agency fees can exceed 25 percent of past-due

18

benefits, normally, it should not exceed

19

50 percent, and in many cases, where the courts

20

-- where you've got a lot of benefits, as the

21

Court recognized in Gisbrecht, the

22

reasonableness criterion allows courts to

23

police for windfall -­

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, what's your

definition of "smaller" versus "more

2

Justice Kagan's question?

MR. YANG:

spent on the case, but what is -­

have -- it falls somewhere in the middle.

It comes right out

21

unusual to have a 50 percent chunk out of a

claimant's -- out of a party's pocket.

23

MR. YANG:

That -- that is true for

24

many tort cases, although I don't believe it's

25

unheard of.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

MR. YANG:

Yeah, and in a lot of these

cases, you must understand these are all

uncertainty about how many, if any, past-due

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So -- and

Well, it's low

stakes for the attorney, but it's high stakes

for the claimant.

13

MR. YANG:

That is true, but, again,

14

there are two countervailing interests that

15

Congress was trying to address here.

And if you -- if the cap is too -­

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's -- that's

23

where -- I'm sorry to belabor this, but that's

24

where the amicus briefs of the disabled -­

25

disability attorneys comes in because they say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

they usually agree not to take more than

what's going on in those areas -­

5

MR. YANG:

Well, I think attorneys -­

7
8

So I'm not sure how your point

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- where there's

not a cap.

9

MR. YANG:

-- the typical fee

10

agreement that exists caps out at 25 percent of

11

past-due benefits, both for the agency and for

12

the -­

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

don't need 50 percent to incentivize.

15

MR. YANG:

Exactly.

So you

Well, there are different

16

fee agreements, both for the agency at 25 and

17

for the court at 25.

18

at issue here.

19

That -- that's what was

So, if you were to look at the fee

20

agreements that were signed by Mr. Culbertson

21

and the claimant in this case, it actually

22

would be a 50 percent fee that was agreed to.

23

So I think the -- what you may be

24

referring to in the agency or in the amicus

25

brief was fee agreements are 25 percent, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

there's a fee agreement for agency proceedings

2

and there's a separate one for court

3

proceedings.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, if I understand

5

what you're saying to us, Mr. Yang, there have

6

been -- one could respond to some of these

7

qualms about a 50 percent fee by saying don't

8

worry, it will never happen.

9

But you're specifically not saying

10

that.

11

proceedings at two different levels, 50 percent

12

fees is going to happen, and it's going to

13

happen in order to ensure representation at

14

both of those levels.

15

You're saying in a case where there are

MR. YANG:

It -- it -- it may well

16

happen.

17

to be reasonable, but -- and there is a

18

judicial as well as an administrative check on

19

that.

20

Those fees would have to be determined

But, yes, if it is a reasonable fee in

21

those circumstances, sometimes it may well be

22

50 percent.

consequence of the -- of providing sufficient

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WEIL,

8

COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE,

9

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

10
11

MS. WEIL:

Thank you.
Ms. Weil.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

Section 406 is not a model of clarity.

13

It's a piecemeal statute that was enacted over

14

a series of amendments over a course of 50

15

years.

16

But the best interpretation of its

17

provisions, one that the agency has adopted and

18

-- and argued in favor of in the courts for

19

half a century, up until April of this year, is

20

that it imposes a 25 percent aggregate cap on

21

agency and court fees.

22

There are three primary reasons why

23

this is the best interpretation of the statute.

24

First, it is the most plausible reading.

25

you take all of the amendments as a whole, when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

When

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

you read it, and in order -- in the order in

2

the enactment of the amendments, and if you

3

look at the multiple references within them to

4

a 25 percent cap, and if you look at the fact

5

that the eye toward the purpose of the statute

6

is to regulate attorney's fees in a fair

7

manner, to protect the benefits of the disabled

8

with one 25 percent withholding, it is a

9

reasonable, plausible interpretation.

10

And it is one, second, which the

11

agency agreed with and devised a framework for

12

the payment of fees and the representation of

13

claimants in the -- before the agency and

14

before the court.

15

And they created this framework with,

16

as its most notable feature, this one

17

25 percent cap, which would make little sense

18

if there was not an aggregate 25 percent cap on

19

fees.

20

There's one 25 percent withholding.
And, also, third, the capping of these

21

fees by 25 percent balances what we know to be

22

Congress's intent.

23

enacting the first 25 percent cap.

24
25

It was stated in 1965 in

They were concerned about the
inordinate attorney's fees that were being

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

collected when -- when the court fees were not

2

being regulated.

3

were regulated to $20 or $30 if you had to go

4

before the Appeals Council also, but there was

5

no cap on court fees.

6

At the time, the agency fees

And they were concerned by just

7

33 percent, but a third to a half of fees being

8

paid to attorneys for having to take these

9

cases to court.

10

If the claimants had been successful

11

originally and the agency hadn't wrongfully

12

withheld the benefits, the claimants would have

13

had 100 percent of their past-due benefits.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, on that on

15

the incentive structure point, I -- I -- I can

16

surely understand the impulse, and I feel that

17

the 25 percent's quite a lot, even if past-due

18

benefits, I know future benefits are untouched,

19

and that's a sympathetic position.

20

But couldn't a rational Congress also

21

think that there are some extraordinary cases

22

that are hard and in order to incentivize

23

attorneys more might be appropriate, in order

24

-- I mean, if you overregulate, you create

25

scarcity, right?

And if you overregulate the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

availability of attorneys, nobody's going to

2

take the case.

3

MS. WEIL:

That is the -­

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And so, here, isn't

5

it at least conceivable that a rational

6

Congress might think there would be an odd case

7

where you need above 25 percent, up to 50, but

8

we're going to put in special checks, a

9

reasonableness inquiry at the administrative

10

level and a reasonableness inquiry at the

11

district court, all of which is subject to

12

further review, I'm sure.

13

So why -- why -- why is that an

14

irrational scheme to provide incentive

15

structures so that people do have

16

representation and that there isn't artificial

17

scarcity?

18

MS. WEIL:

See, it's not an irrational

19

scheme to say they would have done it some

20

other way.

21

is the way that balanced.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

They did it this way because this

Okay.

So your

argument is that on the text you win -­

24

MS. WEIL:

Well -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- but as a matter

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37

of policy you admit it's a draw?

2

MS. WEIL:

-- as a matter of policy,

3

there's never been any showing by anyone that

4

there's a disincentive to taking cases because

5

of a cumulative 25 percent.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You admit a

7

reasonable Congress could worry about that

8

scenario?

9

MS. WEIL:

This Congress did worry

10

about the scenario of their getting more than

11

25 percent.

12

14

do.

15

And they had to balance because

22

as a result of that, the client gets $5,000,

but the client also gets up to as long as he

isn't going to come out that there's four

go before the agency and you win, you get

agency fees.

22

You're probably not going to have been there

23

for more than four or six months, maybe a year,

24

but you get the benefits that are accumulating

over time.

The way this really works is, if you

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. WEIL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- so now we get

$12,500 and he would like $12,000 more because

he had to go to court, and that took another

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, counsel, I

2

think what Justice Breyer's getting at, and I

3

think it's a premise of my question too, is,

4

isn't it fair to say that in a -- in a

5

significant number of cases that future

6

benefits are larger than past benefits?

7

MS. WEIL:

They're -- yes, future

8

benefits are, but I disagree with the concept

9

that you won't be hounded.

I do believe that

10

there is definitely leeway in the statute and

11

leeway in 407 for claimants to be hounded after

12

these past-due benefits, because 407 only

13

allows -- only says you can't go after future

14

benefits, but 406(a) -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- see, that's what

I was worried about.

In other words, the

client -- the lawyer cannot ask for a fee

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

maybe we should just be practical, okay?

11

assume that there's 25 percent of the judgment

12

that wasn't paid out.

13

lawyer can do to get that 25 percent?

What do you think the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Let's

If there were -­
He can't go after

the future benefits, correct?

17

MS. WEIL:

I don't believe that's

18

necessarily true, because the future benefits

19

cannot be gone after, but these are past-due

20

benefits.

21

So -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let's -- let's

22

stop there.

So you're saying, yes, he could

23

potentially go after the pot of past-due

24

benefits up to the excess that he wants, is

25

that -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

MS. WEIL:

Right.

There's a

2

25 percent withholding and that will be paid

3

out.

4

that's awarded to an attorney, the client will

5

already have received the 75 percent, but he

6

will -- as the cases in the Ninth and Tenth

7

circuits have suggested about going after the

8

fees when they're over the 25 percent

9

withholding, they have to find other ways to

10
11

If there's an additional 25 percent

get them.
One way you can get them is saying

12

they are past-due benefits, and they might have

13

been put into your bank account, they might

14

have been put into your house, but you can

15

attach that because you certified -- a court or

16

the agency certified them as past-due benefits.

17

So they're available.

18

And, number two, they could be

19

considered to be wrongfully not withheld.

20

That's what happens when the agency allows you

21

to go after future benefits.

22

there's 25 percent withholding.

Now, right now,

23

So if you -- if the agency -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

I -- I -- I think

that may be wrong on your part because the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43

agency is only authorized to withhold

2

25 percent.

3

MS. WEIL:

Right.

4

So I don't think

5

you can claim that they wrongfully didn't

6

withhold an additional 25 percent.

think -­

10

MS. WEIL:

That's because the agency's

framework is set up for a 25 percent aggregate

I -- I -- I take

15

your point that there could be garnishment on

16

the past-due amounts, is what you're saying.

17

I'm presuming also that that attorney could

18

withhold documents from the client, could do

19

anything else a lawyer does when they're not

20

paid, correct?

21

MS. WEIL:

Right.

And these are not

22

typical clients.

These are clients who are

23

only in this position because they were

wrongfully withheld their benefits in the first

have said that the two words -- it's -- there

12

-- there are two words in this entire statute

13

that just make their position correct and that

14

say that you get up to 50 percent of benefits,

15

and those two words are "such representation"

16

in section (b).

before -- in (a), before the commissioner?
MS. WEIL:

Well, their argument really

has been pointing to the (b) language of "such

Official - Subject to Final Review
46

representation" before the court, and they

2

claim that that shows that you can get up to

3

50 percent of the past-due benefits.

4

would suggest to Your Honors that actually

5

supports a 25 percent aggregate rule, because

6

what the statute provides is only -- that you

7

can get up to 25 percent of past-due, up to,

8

not to definitely get 25, but up to 25 percent

9

of past-due benefits for a court representation

their literal text, they argue that the plain

and they can get up to 50 percent.

Well, there are

If you actually literally read the

statute, and you don't know anything about the

Or, other option, two, you go before

the court, and if you get a favorable judgment,

2

you win.

And that was the view that was

3

adopted.

That is actually the literal reading.

4

And it was the view that made -- formed the

5

basis of the single tribunal rule.

6

That was the Sixth Circuit's rule.

7

They said, well, whichever forum you win in,

8

that's where you get paid a fee, that you can

9

look and see if there's any work done in the

10

other forum, but whatever forum you win in, you

11

get a fee.

12

but that actually is the literal reading of the

13

statute:

Well, nobody thinks that's right,

One or the other.

14

The only reason we're here is that we

15

know that that's not how you read it, that you

16

have to read the regulations that are

17

incorporated into the statute, and the way they

18

work, the fact that they both collect fees, the

19

fact that there's one withholding, which really

20

would make no sense.

small, and they came to (b) and they said we're

we're going to balance the interests of the

From the -- from the very

beginning, they had had the 25 percent

22

withholding and 25 percent cap.

23

I

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What -- what about the

24

language that Mr. Yang referred to in (a)(4)?

25

This is the language about payment in an amount

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

equal to so much of the maximum fee as doesn't

2

exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits, which

3

suggests that the maximum fee could be more

4

than 25 percent.

5

MS. WEIL:

I actually think that that

6

language came from a 1990 conference report.

7

And trying to understand what all this is, you

8

have to read all this legislative history.

9

And part of the legislative history

10

was there was a discussion going on in the 1990

11

Senate conference report when they were

12

discussing the fact that the way the system was

13

set up, you would determine past-due benefits.

14

First, you would, if you got -- if you

15

had a disability and SSI claim, you had to

16

determine past-due benefits by first backing

17

out, reducing it by the amount of the SSI

18

before you determined the attorney fee.

19

And the reason they were doing that is

20

they were saying that the person ended up

21

really not needing the SSI, they were made

22

effectively poor by the fact that we weren't

23

paying them the disability originally.

24
25

So when we're -- going to determine
attorneys' fees, we're going to reduce the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

amount of the past-due benefit pool to be paid

2

from.

3

And then we're going to take 25 percent of

4

that.

We're going to back out the SSI payment.

That was the way the setup was.

5

And then they put in the new (a)(4)

6

and the new amendments for the fee agreement

7

process.

8

saying, well, the way we're going to do it now

9

is we're going to let them determine the

And in that, they put in a section

10

past-due benefits out of the disability

11

benefits without reducing it, but they're

12

still -- when we're going to pay them, we still

13

are withholding only the 25 percent.

14

So they're only going to be able to be

15

paid that, even though they're going to be able

16

to get an award now of the disability benefits

17

without the SSI backed out, when it comes to

18

being paid, they're going to have to only get

19

from us the 25 percent after the SSI reduction.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Weil, I

21

believe it helps you, doesn't it, that the

22

probability of there being an award over

25 percent of the past-due amounts is when no

past-due amounts are awarded, correct?

25

an attorney can receive a reasonable fee.

MS. WEIL:

Correct, in a overpayment

or a termination case?

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

And so

4

in those -- in those cases, it's always going

5

to be 25 percent -- more than 25 percent.

6
7

MS. WEIL:

won't be any past-due benefits.

8
9

Well, there -- yeah, there

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

Are

there any other situations in which the

10

25 percent -- over 25 percent could be, in

11

fact, calculated?

12

MS. WEIL:

Calculated?

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because the

14

government's making much of this, that Congress

15

contemplated it, and I thought your brief said

16

they contemplated it only in the two

17

circumstances of where there's no past-due

18

amounts.

19

MS. WEIL:

Well, that's correct.

I

20

mean, the only time you would be getting

21

benefits, you'd either -- the only time these

22

cases would come before without two past -­

23

without past-due benefits being available to

24

determine the 25 percent out of would be

25

overpayment and termination cases.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

I think it's very important to keep in

2

mind when we are looking at this as a whole to

3

determine what Congress had intended in terms

4

of who we're talking about.

5

claimants who, had they originally gone before

6

the agency and been awarded -- awarded their

7

benefits, they wouldn't have had anything out

8

of them.

9

their benefits awarded.

10

Again, these are

They would have had 100 percent of

But now agency wrongfully, and it

11

turns out they agree, wrongfully denied them

12

the benefits.

13

years, these past-due benefits are accruing,

14

this isn't nothing.

15

So the -- over a course of

This isn't a small -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But isn't that

16

exactly the hardest cases where you maybe are

17

most in need of good legal services and lawyers

18

might be least likely to participate?

19

MS. WEIL:

Well, that's the fortunate

20

thing about (a), the 25 percent does satisfy

21

the attorneys and, (b), the EAJA award can be

22

in excess of that.

23

whole and the attorney can -­

24
25

You can make the claimant

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But you would agree

with the premise that -- that these are the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

cases, these are the hardest cases where

2

attorneys are most useful perhaps?

3

MS. WEIL:

Well, I think they're

4

necessary to go into court.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

MS. WEIL:

7

I don't know necessarily

the hardest cases, but definitely -­

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MS. WEIL:

They've lost below.

And that's the only -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

MS. WEIL:

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13

Yeah.

They've lost below.

They lost below.
And now they're

going to court?

14

MS. WEIL:

And now they're going to

15

court.

16

had to go to court, had they not had to go to

17

court and had they been rightfully paid, then

18

they wouldn't be paying any attorneys' fees.

19

And my point being that had they not

So a lot of people might think:

Well,

20

maybe the government ought to be paying their

21

fees.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Sure.

That would be

a reasonable judgment too.
MS. WEIL:

But, instead, this is

coming out of past-due benefits.

So you have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

to determine, and Your Honors have to

2

determine, what did Congress intend when they

3

were doing this.

4

When they put the statute out, when we

5

know they thought 33 percent to 50 percent was

6

inordinately high, what did they actually

7

intend to have happen with the agency?

8

agency determined that 25 percent was the

9

maximum.

And the

And the agency determined that that

10

25 percent aggregate was what they would

11

advocate in favor of.

12

And, in fact, if I could, Your Honors,

13

I found the brief where they wrote in Dawson to

14

explain their position, which has been

15

maintained for 50 years, for half a century:

16

"The most of the benefits provided for

17

by the Act are intended to supply a means of

18

livelihood to persons who have been deprived of

19

their ability to support themselves, e.g., old

20

age benefits for retirees and disability

21

benefits for the disabled.

22

"The majority of the claimants for

23

benefits, therefore, depend upon them for

24

subsistence, part of their livelihood.

25

most, many of the benefits are their sole means

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And for

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

of support.

2

benefits are recovered from the Secretary, the

3

claimant is in dire financial need.

4

of a third to a half of these benefits,

5

whatever the purpose, can impose serious

6

financial hardship on the claimant.

7

Often, by the time past-due

Deduction

"Congress has sought to balance these

8

needs against that of the attorney by giving

9

the court authority to fix a fee for the

10

attorney when the court renders a judgment

11

favorable to the claimant and by limiting the

12

amount of that fee to a maximum of 25 percent

13

of the past-due benefits.

14

"It's plain, therefore, that the

15

Court's allowance of a fee in a Social Security

16

case larger than an overall 25 percent of

17

past-due benefits recovered would be contrary

18

to Congress's will."

19

That was -- that was -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry,

21

counsel, what are you -- what are you reading

22

from?

23

MS. WEIL:

I'm reading from the brief

24

of the government in Dawson.

25

1970.

So that was in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

Then, in Gisbrecht, the solicitor said

2

that "the statute's primary goal is ensuring

3

the claimant keeps as much of the back-due

4

award as possible."

5

And then later said -- quoted an

6

Eleventh Circuit case, Kay versus Apfel, in the

7

same brief in this Court, that "406(b) is

8

designed to protect a particularly vulnerable

9

class of claimants.

Many claimants in Social

10

Security benefit cases are minors or

11

incompetent to manage their affairs, or

12

disadvantaged by lack of education or physical

13

or mental impairment."

14

So I think that this Court in looking

15

at what Congress intended needs to look at what

16

the Commission had said for years, because they

17

were the implementing body.

18

who were reading these statutory changes, the

19

amendments as they came along, and they made it

20

consistent, always were consistently taking the

21

position that 25 percent of the past-due

22

benefits that had been accruing over the time

23

the case was in court or before the agency was

24

what would be Congress's intent.

25

They were the ones

Congress, the agency, and the courts

have knitted together a system with a

25 percent aggregate cap that has been working

urged this Court to pull a thread on that

5

system and to begin to unravel it.

Petitioner and Respondents have

I would urge this Court not to do

7

that.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15

MR. ORTIZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

16

Might I make quickly three points:

17

It's not the case that overpayment and

18

termination are the only situations where you

19

can get in a situation of having over

20

25 percent.

21

under the petition fee process where the agency

22

sets a reasonable fee, there's no restriction

23

on that.

24
25

You can also have those cases

The timeline problem that my friend
mentions is really no problem at all because,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

in Gisbrecht, this Court instructed the lower

2

court to take exactly that consideration into

3

account in setting reasonable fees under 406.

4

And, finally, in Horenstein, although

5

that was primarily a single tribunal case, the

6

Sixth Circuit en banc made clear that the

7

single tribunal rule and the aggregate cap rule

8

had to stand or fall together.

9

We ask this Court to reverse the

10

judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand for

11

further proceedings.
