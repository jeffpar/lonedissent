ORAL ARGUMENT OF ISHAN BHABHA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BHABHA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

When a vocational expert testifies

12

about the existence of a specific number of

13

jobs in a specific location at a specific time,

14

that testimony can only be based on statistical

15

data-driven sources.

16

refuses upon request to provide those sources,

17

the expert's testimony, standing alone, cannot

18

constitute substantial evidence for three

19

reasons.

20

And when the expert

First, this Court's definition of the

21

term "substantial evidence" and its application

22

of that term in reviewing the decisions of

23

administrative tribunals.

24

government's arguments as to why the expert's

25

testimony standing alone is sufficient are

Second, because the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

unpersuasive.

2

rule that has worked since 2002 in the Seventh

3

Circuit and, indeed, is consistent with the

4

government's own policy, as encapsulated in the

5

Social Security Administration's Vocational

6

Expert Handbook.

7

And, third, because this is the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The counsel for the

8

claimant asked for the source material but then

9

didn't engage in any cross-examination of -- of

10
11

the witness, of the expert witness.
MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, as a factual

12

matter, after being denied the material, he did

13

engage in some cross-examination that appears

14

in the record.

15

Honor, is that, without the material itself,

16

any meaningful cross-examination regarding the

17

expert's methodology, the provenance of the

18

expert's labor market surveys was impossible.

19

But I think critical, Your

And I would note that it would be a

20

rare case when you would be asked to

21

cross-examine a statistical expert who is

22

opining upon specific numbers that the expert

23

has then modified through calculations without

24

actually seeing the data sources itself.

25

I think this Court's decision in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

Florida Power & Light is an important precedent

2

in this respect because, there, the Court noted

3

that the testimony, the well-founded testimony

4

of an expert may be enough if firsthand

5

information is unavailable.

6

And, here, particularly because there

7

were two sources the expert relied upon, the

8

Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which was

9

public, but then also her private labor market

10

surveys, which the ALJ never saw and we never

11

saw, that made any form of cross-examination or

12

meaningful inquiry into the basis for these

13

numbers impossible.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what I don't

15

understand about your argument is how it

16

connects with the substantial evidence

17

question.

18

quantum of proof, and I -- it's hard for me to

19

see why that inquiry is different depending on

20

whether the underlying information in -- in

21

question was requested or not.

22

Substantial evidence refers to a

The -- the argument that you're making

23

sounds like a procedural question, a due

24

process question, whether it was unfair not to

25

require the expert to produce the underlying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

data.

2

Can -- can you just explain how the

3

procedural question that seems to be at the

4

core of what you're arguing fits in with the

5

substantial evidence test?

6

MR. BHABHA:

Of course, Your Honor.

7

So I think we have two answers to that

8

question.

9

First and foremost, we are not asking

10

for the document-on-demand procedural rule that

11

the government characterizes us.

12

government, who bears the burden at step 5, is

13

choosing in these cases to only rely on the

14

testimony of a vocational expert.

15

The

Now the government has at its

16

availability to enter other evidence into the

17

record as well.

18

submit its own labor market surveys, we would

19

not say, and are not saying, that there's a

20

stand-alone constitutional violation because

21

the vocational expert didn't give her surveys.

22

If the government chose to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I know you're

23

not saying that, but you have a quantum of

24

evidence; it's substantial or it's not

25

substantial.

Explain, if you can, why the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

question of -- the issue of substantiality

2

depends on whether the evidence was asked for

3

or not.

4

MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, I think it

5

flows from the basic intuition that when you

6

question an expert about data, if the expert

7

cannot then back up their testimony, that

8

creates doubt.

9

And although I don't think it's an

10

exact match, I think a useful analogy are the

11

adverse inference cases, which this Court has

12

recognized when a party or a witness says I am

13

presenting evidence to the court, but there is

14

better evidence somewhere else that

15

substantiates what I am saying -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I -- I see that

17

argument.

18

attorney for -- who was it who said that the -­

19

the expert was not required to produce the

20

evidence?

21

adversary, or was it the -- the ALJ?

22

Now, in this case, was it the

Was there opposition on -- by your

MR. BHABHA:

It was the ALJ.

And so,

23

Your Honor, what I think is critical here is

24

that, when the government says the record is

25

exactly the same, it is not.

If, for example,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

the expert had said when questioned for the

2

data I have a source, but I'm not going to

3

identify it, I'm not going to show it to you, I

4

think that would create real doubt.

5

--

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

And here

Yeah, I -- I see that.

7

But, when the -- the expert says this is my

8

opinion, and you say produce the underlying

9

evidence, and the expert doesn't say no, I'm

10

not going to do that, I won't do that, somebody

11

-- the -- the judge intervenes and says no,

12

that's not required, why does that create doubt

13

about the validity of the expert's testimony?

14

The expert hasn't refused to produce that

15

evidence.

16

ALJ.

17

It's been the intervention by the

MR. BHABHA:

So, Your Honor, if I can

18

just clarify.

19

said that data is in my confidential client

20

files and, therefore, I don't want to produce

21

it.

22

that.

23

It was both here.

The expert

And the ALJ said, I'm not going to require

And I would note that the government

24

doesn't defend in this Court the

25

confidentiality rationale.

And I think the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

reason for that, Your Honor, is that, as the

2

claimant's lawyer said below, it would be easy

3

to redact or black out the names of the

4

clients.

5

administrative agencies deal with highly

6

sensitive information about national security

7

or intellectual property every day.

8
9

Indeed, federal courts and

JUSTICE BREYER:
I don't understand.

But here's the thing

Sure, maybe he made a -­

10

you're right in this case, maybe.

11

even if we were in court, experts rely on all

kinds of things.

14

on for your conclusion, he says, I'm relying on

15

Ptolemy.

16

But, I mean,

And if you -- the other side

Not Copernicus?

No, Ptolemy.

Well, that might be a good ground for

17

going into it.

18

ground for going into it or not depends on the

19

case.

20

here, where, in fact, it's not even a court,

21

and you have a law which says you don't even

22

have to use court rules of evidence.

23

I -- I -- you see my point?

24
25

And so whether there's a good

And why -- why would it be any different

you're right.

Maybe

But do I repeat it?

MR. BHABHA:

Your -- I understand your

point, Your Honor -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. BHABHA:

4
5

Okay.

-- but, with respect, I

-- I disagree with it, and for two reasons.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'm not -- I'm

6

asking a question.

7

different from even a trial where the standard

8

is less, and in a trial, my understanding is -­

9

is that what you disagree with?

10
11

I'm saying why is it

Or, here,

certainly, it would depend on the case.
MR. BHABHA:

So, Your Honor, I have a

12

practical answer to your question and a legal

13

answer, and I'd like to give both if I might.

14

As a practical matter, vocational

15

expert testimony has been widely criticized in

16

the courts of appeals, with courts noting that

17

the methodology is at times preposterous,

18

leading to numbers that are likely

19

fabrications.

20

demonstrates, for the exact same jobs that our

21

vocational expert in this case opined there

22

were 120,000 jobs -- that was for the nut

23

sorter or the sorter category of jobs -­

24

experts for that exact same job in almost

25

identical time periods have given numbers from

And as the NOSSCR amicus brief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

the hundreds up to 480,000.

2

And the reason for this huge range in

3

the answers experts give is it's not simply

4

like an expert in these cases is Googling the

5

number of appellate lawyers in Washington, D.C.

6

They have to go first to the Dictionary of

7

Occupational Titles, a book that was written in

8

1977 and was last updated in 1991, and

9

involves all -­

10

But what you're

11

telling me is that the expert should -- they

12

should have gone into it in this case because

13

it was really rotten.

14

bar, and you would think that the bar there

15

would find a case -- maybe it's yours -- and go

16

to the court of appeals and say:

17

should have looked into this one.

18

when they look into that one, if they disagree

19

with you, you would have said just what you're

20

saying now.

21

You have a pretty good

Look, you
And then,

What I don't understand, you see -­

and you might have won.

And maybe you should

win.

What I don't understand is having an

1

how much trouble it would be, would have to,

2

without cross-examination or a strong basis in

3

the law, or in the -- in the facts of the case,

4

why he'd have to produce all this stuff.

5

it is confidential.

6

Maybe sometimes he shouldn't.

Maybe sometimes he should.

7

You see, that's my problem.

8

MR. BHABHA:

9
10

Maybe

I understand your

problem, Justice Breyer, and let me see if I
can address it.

11

The government itself, I would note,

12

as a policy matter tells experts you should be

13

prepared to explain, cite, and furnish the

14

sources upon which you rely.

15

In the handbook that the Social

16

Security Administration gives to experts, it

17

says that five times.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

that wasn't in place at the time.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

Can I go back to Justice Breyer's

2

initial question, and perhaps Justice Alito's.

3

You say very explicitly in your reply brief

4

you're not asking for an absolute rule that an

5

-- that an expert must, before testifying,

6

produce these materials.

7

for when it's asked for.

8

You make an exception

But you also concede in your reply

9

brief that there might be situations where it's

10

not necessary, where the expert opines, doesn't

11

produce their materials, but there's other

12

independent evidence that's reliable and could

13

be relied upon to constitute substantial

14

evidence.

15

And so there's no absolute rule

16

according to you.

But what you're asking us

17

now to hold, I think, is that, as a matter of

18

law, an expert who opines on something and

19

refuses to provide the sources is sufficiently

20

unreliable that it doesn't constitute

21

substantial evidence.

22

Is that what you're trying -­

23

MR. BHABHA:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. BHABHA:

Not -­
-- to get us to -­

-- not exactly, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

Sotomayor, if I can be very clear on the rule

2

that the Seventh Circuit has held and that we

3

are arguing for in this Court.

4

In this context, when an expert is

5

providing statistical data and then cites to

6

statistical sources they rely upon, and say

7

these are the sources, and these are not public

8

sources, this expert relied on two sources, one

9

of which was private.

10

The ALJ never saw it.

11

We had never seen it.

In that situation, the Seventh Circuit

12

has held that if you ask the expert, just show

13

me the sources that you yourself are relying

14

upon so that the agency can make a

15

determination and so that we can conduct a

16

meaningful cross-examination, in that

17

situation, the say-so is not enough.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

defining meaningful.

20

a hypothetical.

21

All right.

But let's -- let me pose

Expert says what this expert says, and

22

you get up and say:

23

had the same conditions as my client has?

24
25

You're

How many of these people

And the expert says:

Virtually every

one of them.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1
2

How many people did you do research on
with respect to this issue?

3

I contacted about 15 businesses.

4

Have you placed these kinds of

5

individuals in the kinds of jobs you've talked

6

about?

7

Yes, a hundred of them.

8

Whatever -- do you believe that, in

9

that circumstance, you could stand here and say

10

that there wasn't substantial evidence from

11

which the ALJ could rely upon, even if you had

12

not seen the underlying records?

13

MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, I think -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm giving you the

15

best case for them, because the better case for

16

you is for her to say:

17

placed anyone with that -- with those

18

conditions.

19

I'm extrapolating from that some sort of

20

methodology that really could be questionable.

21
22

Well, I've never really

I only checked one employer.

But

Those are the two extremes we have,
isn't it?

23

MR. BHABHA:

That's right, Your Honor.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

potential extremes we have.

All right, the
But no one asked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

any of those questions below for us to make a

2

judgment about whether the ALJ's ruling was

3

reasonable or not.

4
5

MR. BHABHA:

So, Your Honor, if I can

answer your question in two ways.

6

First, I think ours is the easier case

7

because, here, the expert didn't say it was my

8

experience.

9

And so the expert explicitly didn't say, I have

10

She said labor market surveys.

placed a number of people.

11

But taking Your Honor's hypothetical

12

head on, in a situation in which a vocational

13

expert says I've placed a number of people over

14

my 10-year career in this position or in these

15

sets of positions, I think it is likely that

16

would not be substantial evidence, and here's

17

why, Your Honor.

18

Section 423(d)(2)(A), the statutory

19

provision here, requires that there be a

20

significant number of jobs in the national

21

economy.

22

Now that number has -- what

23

"significant" means is a subject of some

24

debates in the courts of appeals and it appears

25

to be a multi-factor test.

But what is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

critical is that's at least in the hundreds,

2

and likely in the thousands.

3

And these types of jobs that are

4

getting placed are very specific jobs with

5

people with very specific limitations.

6

if an expert said I've placed 15 people over

7

the last 10 years in these jobs with similar

8

limitations to your client, that doesn't

9

provide a basis to know that there are hundreds

10
11

So even

or thousands of those jobs.
And I think it's for that reason that

12

vocational experts rely on surveys and not only

13

their own personal experience in propounding

14

their testimony.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I think you're

16

missing the point, which is you wouldn't have

17

needed the surveys to make the argument you

18

just made.

19

expert and shown the lack of a sufficient basis

20

for their conclusion and then made that

21

argument to the ALJ.

22

You could have questioned the

What I'm trying to get at is I

23

understand the need in some situations to

24

actually see the surveys, but don't you have to

25

lay at least some predicate ground for why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1
2
3
4

that's necessary in your particular case?
MR. BHABHA:

I understand your

question, Your Honor.
I think initially I will just say as a

5

factual matter, and I think the record bears

6

this out, as soon as my client's or claimant's

7

representative asked for the surveys, the ALJ

8

made clear she wasn't going to give them.

9

don't think there was any opportunity even to

10
11

So I

proffer reasons.
But even beyond that, Your Honor, it

12

is the government's burden at this stage.

13

given the nature of this type of statistical

14

testimony, even at cross-examination, when, as

15

in our case, an expert says I relied on public

16

data and I relied on private data, it is hard

17

for me to conceive of what kind of a meaningful

18

cross you could do of the private data.

19

expert then provides her answers about this is

20

what the data said, this is what I did to the

21

data, but there's no way of verifying any of

22

those kind of answers.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

The

Well, one way

24

-- one way to be -- to look at the publicly

25

available data, right, and there was no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

questioning about that, was there?

2

the extent the Bureau of Labor Statistics

3

information shows, you say, 8,000 jobs in

4

southwestern Michigan, if that's where it was,

5

and the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a

6

different number, why did you choose eight?

7

I mean, to

In other words, there -- there were

8

fields, I'm not saying there are ample fields,

9

but there are fields for fertile

10

cross-examination that weren't explored, I

11

think.

12

MR. BHABHA:

Mr. Chief Justice, I

13

think it is certainly a different case if an

14

expert only relies on public data.

15

absolutely agree you have exactly what the

16

expert relied upon.

Then I

17

In a case like this, however, and I

18

think in many cases like this -- and this is

19

why vocational expert testimony has been a

20

subject of criticism -- the public data alone

21

is not only not enough, but it is often of an

22

entirely different character because the

23

taxonomy in the public data, in the BLS data,

24

uses a far larger definition of jobs than what

25

the DOT, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

codes, which is what the AL -- the VE is

2

required to identify.

3

So what happens is, in our case, for

4

example, the SOC, the Standard Occupational

5

Classification codes in the Census, encompass

6

in some cases hundreds of DOT codes.

7

when you look at the overall number that comes

8

from the Census, that could be in the thousands

9

or in the hundred thousands, but the critical

And so,

10

question -- and this is what the vocational

11

expert is required to do -- is to say how many

12

jobs with somebody with this level of

13

education, this skill level, these kind of

14

disabilities, how many jobs are available for

15

them.

16

So, while I agree that BLS source was

17

available, it was a very partial source at

18

best.

19

that's why the experts in this situation didn't

20

only rely on the BLS data -- was because there

21

needed to be a significant winnowing of those

22

numbers to get to the answers to the ALJ's

23

hypo.

And I think the critical question -- and

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's a

25

good -- it strikes me that that's a good

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

argument to have made before the ALJ, at which

2

point the ALJ may have said, well, I see that

3

now, and you should have access to the private

4

data and you can just redact it.

5

wasn't -- that wasn't done here.

6

MR. BHABHA:

But that

Well, Your Honor, the one

7

thing that was done -- I agree, that wasn't

8

laid out to the ALJ.

9

What was laid out the first time that

10

we asked for the data and were refused,

11

immediately, counsel said:

12

substantial evidence standard.

13

conclusions are not enough.

14

Look, it's a
These vague

So I think it was certainly put in

15

issue to the ALJ, we need something more.

16

I would just note that this is a very specific

17

type of testimony.

18

witness is giving statistical answers,

19

identifying statistical sources.

20

And

This is testimony where a

And I think it would be rare in

21

administrative procedure in that situation for

22

an agency to say:

23

sources, they are the sole basis for the

24

testimony, but no regulated party or no party

25

before the agency, you can't see those sources

Yes, there are these data

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

in order to meaningfully challenge the

2

conclusions of the expert.

3

And I think, Your Honors, Perales is

4

an interesting case in this respect.

5

agree with the government, for sure, Perales

6

discusses procedural due process.

7

crucial in Perales, Perales came under Section

8

405(g) of the Social Security Act, the very

9

same provision we have at issue here.

10

Now we

But equally

And the question presented by the

11

government in Perales to the Court was whether

12

or not the medical expert testimony in that

13

context could be substantial evidence.

14

And I think what's important about

15

Perales is that, in part 5 of the opinion,

16

while certainly also discussing procedural due

17

process issues, the Court in Perales gives

18

indicia of why the testimony there had

19

probative value and why it was reliable.

20

think it's very important to look at that case

21

because, there, the medical experts didn't just

22

give conclusions.

And I

23

What the Court noted specifically in

24

Perales was that they laid out the tests that

25

were conducted, the results of those tests, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

types of surgeries that were conducted, and the

2

results after surgery.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your reliance on

4

that case raises the interesting question, a

5

question I think is interesting, which is

6

whether there would be any basis for limiting

7

the rule that you're asking us to adopt to the

8

specific situation here, which you have

9

stressed where it's testimony, it's statistical

10

testimony by a vocational expert in a Social

11

Security disability hearing.

12

Why wouldn't the rule that you're

13

asking us to adopt apply whenever there is the

14

question if a determination by an agency is

15

supported by substantial evidence?

16

MR. BHABHA:

Well, Your Honor, I

17

think, for sure, the term "substantial

18

evidence" is one that applies throughout

19

administrative law, but what this Court has

20

made clear in a number of cases is that, of

21

course, substantial evidence looks at the

22

record and, thus, inherent in the question -­

23

in the answer as to what "substantial evidence"

24

means is, what is the question that the agency

25

is trying to address?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

In a situation like this, where you're

2

talking about specific numbers that the agency

3

is relying on as the sole basis to deny my

4

client benefits for the applicable period,

5

there, I think, when the expert points to data

6

sources that she has modified in order to come

7

up with these numbers, there, substantial

8

evidence requires more.

9

But, in other situations, Your Honor,

10

for example, qualitative testimony, even

11

testimony such as these are the kind of jobs in

12

my experience I believe somebody with these

13

sorts of limitations can do, i.e., the first

14

part of what vocational experts testify, I

15

think that's entirely different.

16

But I do think, in this situation, it

17

would be very normal when an administrative

18

agency comes up with specific numbers and bases

19

a determination on specific numerical

20

conclusions, it is the norm to then make the

21

agency or make the expert show their work.

22

I -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why wouldn't your

24

argument be the same if there had been no

25

request at all?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, certainly, we

2

would win if the -- if the rule was that

3

vocational experts have to give over their

4

testimony regardless of a request or not, we

5

would win.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I'm just asking,

why is that part of your proposed rule?
MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, no court of

appeals has ever held that there is a

10

requirement, but I think -- I'm sympathetic to

11

the rationale behind that rule, but I think -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems to me that

13

your rationale suggests that the on-demand part

14

of your test is irrelevant.

15

MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, I don't think

16

it's irrelevant.

17

it's irrelevant for the reason that, when you

18

question a witness and the witness then doesn't

19

give you the testimony -- the very data sources

20

they rely upon, that introduces doubt.

21

And as I said, I don't think

And I think that is where the question

22

and the answer play into the test.

And I think

23

that's the rationale of the Seventh Circuit.

24

They haven't elucidated it exactly in those

25

terms, but that is what I take those decisions

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

to say, which is that, when the testimony is

2

given alone, if it's not challenged, then maybe

3

it's enough.

4

is your data and the witness doesn't give it

5

over -- and, again, the government isn't

6

defending here the confidentiality rationale -­

7

that does create doubt.

8
9

But, when you ask a witness what

And I think the adverse inference
cases show that intuition in the law.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I guess I just

11

-- I'm just not getting it because either it's

12

enough or it's not enough.

13

anything to do with whether somebody -­

14

somebody demands the -- the information.

15
16

MR. BHABHA:

It doesn't have

Well, Your Honor, I

think -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Unless the demand part

18

of the test is something about have you

19

forfeited the right to complain about it.

20

MR. BHABHA:

Well, Your Honor, the

21

Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, which

22

has also applied a similar standard, have

23

talked about this in terms of forfeiture or

24

waiver.

25

perspective, the term "forfeiture" is exactly

But I don't think, from a legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

correct here because you cannot waive the

2

substantial evidence standard.

3

reviewing standard that the court must apply in

4

any circumstance.

5

That is a

So the way I read those cases is to

6

essentially say, if you question somebody that

7

cannot back up the data -- and I think it would

8

be analogous, Your Honor, if you asked a

9

witness in exactly the same case where did you

10

get your data sources from, and the witness

11

said either I'm not going to tell you or they

12

said, well, they occurred to me one day, I

13

looked up something, but I'm not going to

14

identify what it is on the Internet for you,

15

that does create doubt in a record, Your Honor,

16

just as, here, the failure to look at those

17

numbers when requested, even when the

18

claimant's representative said I don't need

19

your clients' names, you can redact those

20

clients' names, that creates doubt in the

21

record.

22

And that is why, particularly in a

23

context such as this when you have multiple

24

outdated data sources which vocational experts

25

have to bring together, when vocational experts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

come up with numbers that vary enormously for

2

the same jobs, and all the more so when this is

3

the sole basis upon which disability benefits

4

applicants are being denied, I think more than

5

just the conclusory statements of the expert

6

are what is required.

7

And again -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Can you draw an

adverse inference against the expert if the

10

expert sincerely believes, perhaps mistakenly,

11

but sincerely believes that what is requested

12

is confidential?

13

MR. BHABHA:

Your Honor, I think the

14

adverse inference case law, again, it's not

15

directly controlling here, for sure, but I

16

think you can use the same intuition from those

17

cases, because there's a very easy method,

18

which, again, the government doesn't dispute

19

here, to redact that information and provide

20

only the crucial information.

21

And I think the reason, again,

22

particularly in this context of vocational

23

experts, why this data is so important and why

24

the failure to provide it is so practically

25

harmful, in addition, we think, to being in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

conflict with the substantial evidence

2

standard, is because these experts are bringing

3

together very old definitions of jobs with

4

entirely different taxonomy of job numbers,

5

putting the numbers together and coming up with

6

a result, and then, in certain circumstances,

7

reducing that result further based on further

8

hypotheticals posed by the ALJ.

9

So it is a data-intensive process.

10

The vocational expert identified as much in her

11

testimony.

12

that the vocational expert is admitting she

13

relied upon hampers not only the claimant's

14

representative's ability to cross-examination

15

but also crucially the ALJ's ability to

16

actually determine whether there are real

17

numbers here.

18

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve
the remainder of my time.

22

And not even having the numbers

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

it please the Court:

2

I'd like to address two general

3

subjects:

4

work and how vocational experts decide whether

5

there are significant numbers of relevant jobs

6

in the national economy.

7

First, how Social Security hearings

Excuse me.

Second, I'd like to address the

8

substantial evidence theory, which is evolving

9

and it is built on a procedural predicate that

10

is incorrect.

11

Each year, there are about 2.6 million

12

initial disability claims that are filed with

13

SSA, and at the third level of review, the SSA

14

conducts 670,000 hearings.

15

2500 a day.

16

for just a response for their hearing, and they

17

wait, on average, about 605 days.

18

adjudicatory process on a scale comparable to

19

this.

20

with broad authority to determine the right

21

process to develop records.

That's about 200 -­

Over 1 million people are waiting

There is no

And Congress has properly vested SSA

22

The question then here -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then doesn't that

24

solve this case?

Because your agency now has

25

in its handbook that every expert has to come

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

prepared to cite the sources that they relied

2

upon and to produce the materials.

3

they've made that judgment, why shouldn't we

4

make the same judgment, that a failure to do so

5

goes to the heart of the expert's

6

unreliability?

7

MR. YANG:

So, if

The Vocational Expert

8

Handbook that -- that we're talking about, the

9

informal guidance, really is referring to

10

vocational resource materials that they use.

11

There are -- and not individual case client

12

files.

13

And if I can explain, there's two

14

levels of analysis that a vocational expert

15

goes -­

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

show me where in the handbook -­

18

MR. YANG:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Do you want to

I think -­
-- that's said so

I know -- so I can follow you?

21

MR. YANG:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. YANG:

24

opp.

25

page 18.

The citation -­
The source.

-- is in -- in our brief in

At page 9, we discuss it, and then on
I don't have the handbook in front of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

me, unfortunately.

2

handbook says is cite, explain, and furnish any

3

sources you rely on to support your testimony.

4

But the reason we think this is talking about

5

resource -- vocational resource materials is

6

because an expert just doesn't know the

7

questions and -- and the granularity of the

8

questions that the expert's going to rely -- be

9

asked.

10
11

So, for example, there's two stages of
questioning -­

12
13

The language that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So they are

picking numbers from the air?

14

MR. YANG:

No, I wouldn't say from the

15

air.

16

educated by the jobs that they do for

17

individual disability clients.

18

explain, there's basically two levels.

19
20

I'd say from experience, which can be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. YANG:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

Aren't they given

the -- the file before they come to testify -­

21

23

If I can

No.
-- on the

individual claimant?
MR. YANG:

No.

They are given the

relevant vocational background but know nothing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

about the disabilities of these claimants.

2

fact, ALJs are prohibited from communicating

3

with vocational experts prior to the hearing

4

because vocational experts are intended to be

5

impartial experts brought by an impartial

6

agency to adjudicate a case.

7

There are then -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

In

You're worrying me

that this is, in fact, what all of the critics
are saying.

11

MR. YANG:

If -- if you can -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That these are

13

numbers pulled out of a hat as a person sits

14

there.

15

MR. YANG:

16

two levels.

17

your concern.

18

If I can explain, there are

I think this will help to address

There -- at the first level of

19

inquiry, the vocational expert is determining a

20

category of jobs based on generally things in

21

-- in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles

22

that discuss exertional limitations and such

23

for those jobs.

24

jobs that do not require any kind of advanced

25

or -- education, unskilled jobs.

So, for instance, sedentary

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

Then the expert relies on public

2

sources, statistical sources like the BLS that

3

provide numbers in the national and local

4

economies.

5

And the expert -- they don't map

6

exactly, so the expert's going to have to use

7

some judgment to extrapolate.

8

questions that can be explored fully at hearing

9

and, in fact, are -- the guidance suggests that

10

they should provide these.

11

that you predict in advance.

12

Those are

These are things

But there's a second level.

At the

13

hearing, there are very specific types of

14

impairments that are not addressed by the

15

grids.

16

high-level impairments, but there are things

17

like non-exertional impairments, depression,

18

ability to concentrate, things like unable to

19

lift above your head, or more than five pounds.

20

These are things that you just don't know until

21

you come into the hearing.

22

The grids take into account these

And in this case, at page 10, for

23

instance, of the reply brief, Petitioner

24

acknowledges that the testimony of the

25

vocational expert -- that if her numbers would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

be reduced by about 20 to 30 percent, if the

2

Petitioner could not lift above his head or

3

lift more than five pounds, that's the second

4

level of inquiry.

5

And that is what's educated by the

6

vocational expert's experience, reflected in

7

her own surveys done for individual clients.

8

And remember, this -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you -- can you

10

explain, what is the confidentiality here?

11

says she relies on the Bureau of Labor

12

Statistics and her own independent research.

13

She

What is your own independent research?

14

I can't tell you because that would -- that's

15

part of client files.

16

MR. YANG:

I think it would help to

17

look at page 118 and 119a of the petition

18

appendix because that's the actual testimony.

19

The first time this comes up in the -- is in

20

the context of where the expert got her number

21

-- her on-task percentage.

22

to be on task about 80 percent.

23

That is, you have

And so she says she gets it from her

24

experience doing job analyses.

25

down:

A few lines

Can you provide the job analyses?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

expert says, I cannot.

2

She just says -- observes those would be part

3

of people's, that is, individuals', private

4

confidential files.

5

It doesn't say that.

Now, remember, this expert, her resume

6

is in the record and she was certified as a -­

a vocational expert.

of the time.

23

that you find -­

24
25

She's saying, on my experience, you

That's the type of information

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, without the

data, how is somebody to cross-examine her on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

that and how is the ALJ to verify that

2

conclusion?

3

MR. YANG:

Well, you cross-examine by

4

simply asking basic questions.

5

say doing job analyses, what does that mean?

6

Where are you getting this information?

7

you talk about your confidential files, what is

8

the information in the confidential file?

9

Where do you develop that information?

10

Well, when you

When

There's a whole string of questions

11

about methodology, sources, that can be

12

explored.

13

to a point, and there are case law, we cite a

14

case, at least one case in our brief where, if

15

you go down the cross-examination path and the

16

expert simply is not able to provide cogent

17

responses, that will undermine the testimony

18

and maybe render it not -- not substantial

19

evidence.

20

And if there -- you -- you can get

But, here, there was no

21

cross-examination.

The judge intervenes.

22

judge says:

23

it's an individual -- confidential files of

24

individual people, I'm not going to require it.

25

It's not -- there's no adverse inference.

I'm not going to require that.

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

The judges -- or the -- the expert

2

simply is explaining that those -- this subset

3

of data, not the high level, but the second

4

level of data, is in confidential files.

5

she goes on to the job numbers.

6

Then

Now, remember, the job numbers are,

7

again, on two different levels.

There's the

8

high-level job numbers, that is, 360,000 jobs

9

between bench assemblers and sorters, and then

10

there's an -- an additional one when -- when

11

you're given the hypothetical about lifting.

12

That's going to be reduced 20 to 30 percent.

13

And counsel asks -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go back to

15

what you said, you would dismiss the -- the

16

handbook, but I think this is an accurate quote

17

from it:

expert, should be prepared to cite, explain,

19

and furnish any sources you rely on to support

20

your testimony.

21

At all hearings, you, the vocational

MR. YANG:

I -- I -- that is probably

22

an exact quote.

But what I will say is that

23

there's no way -- a vocational expert cannot

24

know they're going to ask can you lift five

25

pounds, can you lift seven pounds.

This person

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

reasonable way to read this is we're talking

you don't have to develop much of a record on

would be an unmanageable process.

the question of -­

says, I'm not going to require that.

Does it matter

who -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MR. YANG:

So it's not -- there is -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Yang, you seem

3

to, in answering Justice Gorsuch, believe that

4

because the ALJ was the one who said, I'm not

5

going to order that, that that somehow elevates

6

the prior answer into being reliable?

7

I mean, no expert is the judge in a

8

case, correct?

9

testimony.

The judge has to accept the

10

MR. YANG:

Right, but just -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

So how

12

can an ALJ accept testimony for which it's

13

blocked an answer about how the expert came to

14

their conclusion?

15

MR. YANG:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

The question -­
That -- that's his

basic argument -­

18

MR. YANG:

The question -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which is this

20

testimony is unreliable because I was blocked

21

from being able to show a basis -­

22

MR. YANG:

I -- I understand that

23

process argument.

My point is, and I think as

24

we've explored already, that that's a process

25

argument, not a substantial evidence argument,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

because the substantial evidence depends on -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. YANG:

4
5

No.

-- what actually comes into

evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I could get on the

6

stand and say anything I want.

7

stops the other side from giving the bases for

8

that, the record is devoid of a basis for that

9

answer, and it's unreliable for that reason.

10
11

And if the ALJ

That, I think, is the core of their argument.
MR. YANG:

But, here, the ALJ, which

12

is an impartial ALJ -- or, excuse me, an

13

impartial expert, who's been -- whose

14

qualifications are determined and not objected

15

to, there's no reason to think that she's -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's -­

17

that's fascinating because there was a whole

18

exchange at the beginning of this hearing where

19

the ALJ asked the attorney to stipulate to the

20

expertise of the expert, and the attorney

21

refused to do so.

22
23
24
25

MR. YANG:

Because the attorney

object to the testimony then.

a very different -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- so there's

But not to the

8

expertise and certainly not to the fact that

9

the expertise matches the disabilities at issue

10

in this case.

11

MR. YANG:

Well, let -- let me step

12

back a second, and I think this might help a

13

little.

14

There's a -- a good reason why counsel

15

doesn't probe numbers like this.

16

numbers, the testimony here, were based on two

17

categories of jobs that totaled about 360,000

jobs in the national economy.

Circuit -- there's no magic number about what

20

constitutes the standard of a significant

21

number of jobs, but the Sixth Circuit, which is

22

the governing circuit here, has held,

23

consistent with other courts, that 6,000 is

24

enough.

25

There -- the

or 360, since all of it is far beyond what

would matter.

And so it doesn't

And, remember, this individual

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why is there,

Mr. Yang, such variance in the numbers that

10

these experts give?

I mean, Mr. Bhabha says

11

that when talking about nut sorters -- and I

12

guess I want to know why everybody talks about

nut sorters too.

But it varies from 260

to 470,000.

variance, and it makes you think where is that

coming from and what are to -- what are we to

Now the -- the -- what Petitioner
cites to is a amicus brief that provides for a

list of -- of various numbers, right?

11

you look at the cases that are cited, at the

12

stage 1 of the analysis for the -- the

13

vocational expert estimates, they have to do a

14

few things, one of which is you have to

15

determine the category of jobs.

16

Now, if

Now, in this case, the category was

19

were defined in the Dictionary of Occupational

20

Titles.

21

These are sedentary positions, but

Now different vocational experts are

22

going to focus on different sets.

So some of

them may have a broader set of sorters; some of

them have a lesser set.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you

2

usually -- when you're having someone testify

to data and numbers, the way you cross-examine

is to ask what she relied on and then see if

data on which I relied.
MR. YANG:

give you a few questions I think would have

clarified this case considerably.

14

15

numbers, the -- the expert testified that she

16

relied on BLS numbers.

17

provides both national and regional numbers for

18

various types of jobs.

19

relied on her individual market surveys.

Now, remember, BLS

And she additionally

20

But, remember, in this context, she is

21

an -- a expert who helps individuals find jobs.

22

So her labor market surveys, one would assume,

23

are for individuals finding jobs.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they can

redact the names, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. YANG:

They -- they could redact

2

the names.

But, if you would ask, well, what

3

was -- when you say you rely on the BLS, and

4

then you say you rely on the individual market

5

surveys, what did you rely on the individual

6

market surveys?

7

think is probably the case and as the ALJ

8

probably assumed given the course of testimony,

9

it was, well, there are about 20 to 30 percent

10

of these sedentary jobs that are excluded when

11

you have to lift above your head.

12

we would know -­

And if the expert said, as I

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

what if you think that's wrong?

15

MR. YANG:

Okay.

Then

But

Well, then you can probe

further.

like, what is the basis?

18

we talking about?

survey out?

20

Right?

You can say, well, how did you -­
How many people are

All of these are things that go to the

21

weight.

But, again, to find no substantial

22

evidence, you'd have to find that no rational

decisionmaker could have relied upon that.

24

So there are all kinds of

25

cross-examination questions that would have

clarified this.

evidence on which I'm relying secret, it's not,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

that -- that an expert could say something or

MR. YANG:

And that

Well, there -- there are

11

cases -- there are cases, I think, that -- that

12

highlight exactly what you're talking about,

13

where there's cross-examination -- and we cite,

14

again, at least one or two of these in our

15

brief -- where the -- the -- the -- on review,

16

this -- like, you know, their -- this

17

cross-examination so undermined the basic

18

predicate of -- or the basic testimony that it

19

can no longer be substantial evidence.

20

We're not quibbling with that.

What

21

we're saying is that the categorical

22

document-on-demand rule, which they -- which,

23

frankly, is not a coherent view of substantial

24

evidence, would be imposed on the agency.

will say that there is a -- a significant

undertone of fairness and due process here.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ISHAN BHABHA
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BHABHA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd just like to respond to three
things the government said.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

First and foremost, the government's

2

lawyer represented that the Vocational Expert's

3

Handbook simply requires them to bring public

4

information they might perhaps rely on.

5

I'm sorry, but if you look at page 3

6

of the handbook, it explicitly says at all

7

hearings, you should be prepared to cite,

8

explain, and furnish any sources that you rely

9

on to support your testimony.

10
11

And what I take

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what if I think,

12

Mr. Bhabha, you're right about that, but,

13

instead, it's just, well, that's the best

14

practices rule.

15

not necessarily a legal requirement.

16

But the best practices rule is

MR. BHABHA:

I agree with you, Justice

17

Kagan, but what I take from the government's

18

own handbook is two things.

19

Firstly, their administrability

20

arguments are inconsistent with the policy the

21

Social Security Administration itself is

22

telling vocational experts.

23

specific question of workability in the Seventh

24

Circuit, I disagree with my friend from the

25

SG's office that this isn't the rule that's

And on the

being applied.

2

There is binding Seventh Circuit case

3

law.

We cite cases where this has been the

4

basis for reversal.

5

practitioners in the Seventh Circuit is that

6

this is applied and that when data is not

7

handed over and the case gets appealed to the

8

Appeals Council, in some situations, the Social

Security Administration lawyers agree to a

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The agency hasn't

been applying it in the Seventh Circuit, right?
MR. BHABHA:

Not voluntarily, Justice

15

Kavanaugh.

16

issued an acquiescence ruling.

17

works in practice is that, if this sort of a

18

request is made and the specific data is not

19

there, it is not uncommon for the record to be

20

held open for 14 days and the data is then sent

21

to the ALJ and to the claimant's

22

representative.

23

data and it substantiates the testimony and

24

that ends the matter.

25

That's totally right.

They haven't

But the way it

Hopefully, they look at the

But if it doesn't, then there is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68

opportunity to submit a memorandum to the ALJ.

2

And I will also say specifically on

3

the timing issue, nationally, there are 164

4

hearing officers.

5

to process a claim is 536 days.

6

hearing officers within the Seventh Circuit,

7

based on my calculation which I did last week,

8

and I don't imagine the number has changed

9

significantly, it's 529 days.

10

The average amount of time
For the

So it's actually

quicker in the Seventh Circuit.

11

Now these are obviously large numbers,

12

but the basic point is this procedure, which

13

has existed since 2002, has not been shown to

14

slow down the process.

15

The other thing I'll say is that the

16

government lawyer says, well, you don't know

17

what particular questions are going to be asked

18

at a hearing, so how do you know what sources

19

to have?

20

But, if you don't know particular

21

questions and you don't have the specific

22

data-driven answers, you can't be answering the

23

question in the first place.

24

definition, if they give an answer that there

25

are 3,000 nut sorter jobs or 6,000 bench

So, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

assembler jobs, there must be a data-driven

2

basis for that, which is exactly what the

3

expert again here identified as her source, not

4

her experience, but a labor market survey that

5

she then refused to -- to permit.

6

In sum, Your Honors, what Petitioner

7

is asking for here is a reaffirmation of a

8

basic rule of administrative procedure, which

9

is that an agency cannot make a determination

10

based upon testimony that is premised on secret

11

data without ever giving that data to a

12

requesting claimant.

13

That's all the more so in a case like

14

this, where this was the sole basis upon which

15

my client was denied benefits for the relevant

16

time period.

17

disruption in the Seventh Circuit since 2002,

18

and it is entirely consistent with the very

19

policy the Social Security Administration

20

recognizes as good practice for vocational

21

experts.

22

This rule has worked without

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government says

23

you're asking for more than the Seventh Circuit

24

position.

25

Is that so?
MR. BHABHA:

That is not, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

Ginsburg.

2

rule, which is, succinctly put, that when a

3

vocational expert testifies and the expert

4

identifies data sources that she has relied

5

upon, if you request those data sources and

6

they are not provided, the say-so of the

7

vocational expert alone cannot constitute

8

substantial evidence of the other work

9

available to an applicant.

10

We are asking for exactly the same

For these reasons, Your Honors, we ask

that the decision of the Sixth Circuit be
