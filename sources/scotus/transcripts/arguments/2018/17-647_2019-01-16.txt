CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 17-647,

5

Knick versus the Township of Scott,

6

Pennsylvania.

7

Mr. Breemer.

8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DAVID BREEMER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BREEMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

The critical issue in this case is

13

this:

14

just compensation in violation of the Just

15

Compensation Clause so that a property owner

16

can claim an unconstitutional taking requiring

17

damages?

18

When is an invasion of property without

The understanding adopted well before

19

Williamson County and Dow and other cases is

20

that the invasion itself gives rise to a

21

constitutionally rooted claim for compensation,

22

unless, as in Cherokee Nation, the government

23

recognizes the owner's entitlement to

24

compensation and provides a process for

25

collecting it at the time of the invasion.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

This is the understanding that

2

controls in takings cases against the United

3

States under the Tucker Act, and there's no

4

reason why we should have a different

5

constitutional interpretation of the Just

6

Compensation Clause simply because the

7

defendant is a local government entity.

8

But, in fact, Williamson County does

9

adopt a conflicting and anomalous and mistaken

10

interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause

11

in holding that an invasion of property is not

12

without compensation and not actionable under

13

the Takings Clause until state remedies are

14

exhausted.

15

A basis for this understanding is this

16

Court's decision -- the initial basis is the

17

Great Falls Manufacturing case.

18

And in that case, this Court said that when a

19

property owner has their property invaded, they

20

are entitled from that moment to go seek

21

compensation on a constitutional basis.

This is 1884.

So --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean,

23

the -- the question is whether or not to

24

overrule Williamson County.

25

assumption thus far has been that it turns

And your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

solely on when you have a complete violation of

2

the Constitution and should be able to proceed

3

at that point.

4

But do we -- is it necessarily the

5

case that the -- the same rule has to apply

6

with respect to federal proceedings and a state

7

court proceeding?

8

looking at is not something as grand as when

9

the constitutional violation is -- has come to

I mean, maybe what we're

10

fruition, but, instead, simply a rule about how

11

those cases should be handled in state court as

12

opposed to federal court.

13

Williamson County has what I think of

14

as a special rule for state court proceedings

15

that requires, obviously, you to go to the

16

state court, and I'm just wondering if you can

17

address that on its own without issuing some

18

ruling about when a Takings Clause is complete

19

and -- and actionable.

20

MR. BREEMER:

I don't think so because

21

the only basis for that Williamson County

22

scheme, state readiness scheme, is an

23

interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause

24

when you have a complete claim.

25

other basis for that.

There's no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

And so, if you have a complete claim,

2

as you do in the -- in claims against the

3

United States under Dow, if you have a complete

4

federal claim, well, then you have a federal

5

question and you have the option to go to

6

federal court under Section 1983.

7

purpose of Section 1983, as you know.

8
9

That's the

So I don't see how you -- I don't
think the Fifth Amendment varies depending on

10

what court you're in or what you're defending,

11

and I think the Just Compensation Clause has to

12

be interpreted in the same way in both of those

13

circumstances, and there's no other basis for

14

saying, well, state courts should have it

15

first.

16

doctrine in Monroe and other cases that this

17

Court has rejected.

That's -- that's the no exhaustion

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So could -How does it work?

I

20

mean, I -- I'm having trouble understanding.

21

We have a -- an environmental agency, a state

22

environmental agency which has some kind of a

23

rule, only so much lead can be put into the sea

24

or air or something every mile.

25

dozens of pieces of property within that area.

Now there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

And depending upon the reasonable expectations

2

of individual property owners, it might violate

3

some, and it might not violate others.

4

state also has a system of courts that, where

5

there's a violation, they pay.

6

The

Okay?

So EPA, state, what are they supposed

7

to do?

I mean, how do we decide which ones are

8

right and which ones are wrong?

9

decide which property owners do have the

10

reasonable expectation and not?

11

opinion, how do we do it?

12
13

MR. BREEMER:

How do we

In your

Well, that, as I

understand your question --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, if you're

15

EPA, you are the state EPA, you go into your

16

office --

17

MR. BREEMER:

I --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and there's a

19

queue of people and all of them are saying our

20

property is being taken and we all have

21

different times of purchase, different

22

conditions, dah-dah, dah-dah.

23

All right.

24
25

How do you decide who's

entitled to it?
MR. BREEMER:

That's a merits question

How do you --

How do you decide the

merits?

11

MR. BREEMER:

How do you decide?

The

12

government -- the EPA doesn't have to decide

13

that.

have an actionable claim until they have a ripe

claim, there has been a finding --

you that.

MR. BREEMER:

You are in the state

EPA.

Mr. Smith comes in, and Mr. Jones.

conditions are different.

What do you tell them?

JUSTICE BREYER:

They don't even go to

the EPA?

3

MR. BREEMER:

They should --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. BREEMER:

They don't even ask?

If -- if -- if their

6

property has been injured by an EPA rule, then

7

they -- and it's a final decision that injures

8

their property, then they have the right to

9

assert if that injury gets compensation --

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

What they -- what they have in our state --

12
13
14

No, it's not a final.

MR. BREEMER:

Then they don't have a

claim.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Our state, if you

15

think the state EPA took a piece of your

16

property, go ask them for some money, and

17

there's a good chance they'll give it to you if

18

they think you're right.

19

MR. BREEMER:

Well, there -- you --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. BREEMER:

So what happens?

You -- you can't ask for

22

money, Your Honor, until you have an

23

entitlement.

25

And if the -- the government, the

Sure, I can.

I can

say, Mr. Smith, give me some money.

2

MR. BREEMER:

Well -- well -- well --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. BREEMER:

I just did.

Well, in -- then -- then

6

we're going to have a debate about whether I

7

owe you money or not.

And --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

All I want is the money.

No, no, I don't care.
And I want to know

10

how you, the official, decide whether I'm

11

right.

12
13

MR. BREEMER:

16

It's not

your job as the official.

14
15

You don't.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me ask then

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in other words,

--

17

your proposal is of the, let's say -- let me

18

not exaggerate -- 50 million rules in state

19

agencies in the country, and let's say

20

affecting only 200 million people, that each of

21

those people is not even to ask the state

22

agency for money?

23

court somewhere?

It is to go to a federal
Is that your position?

24

MR. BREEMER:

No, not at all.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

MR. BREEMER:

Because they -- those --

2

the situations you're describing, you still

3

have exhaustion and variance and waiver

4

requirements --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll tell you what

6

the exhaustion in our state -- when the EPA

7

takes something of yours, in your opinion, you

8

know what you do?

9

And if they think you're right, they'll give it

10

to you.

11

Go ask them for some money.

Now what other exhaustion is there?
MR. BREEMER:

The exhaustion I'm

12

talking about is you have to have -- we're not

13

trying to -- to abrogate all of Williamson

14

County.

15

You can't come --

16
17

You still have to have a ripe claim.

JUSTICE BREYER:
Williamson County --

18

MR. BREEMER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Okay.

MR. BREEMER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I just would like the answer to my question.

21

23

I'm not talking about

The -- the answer -You are correct

that -MR. BREEMER:

As I understand it, the

answer is that the administrative agency is not

No, there's no

You would just like them to give

you some money.

So, look, the reason I'm

10

should be obvious -- but there is no practical

11

way that I can think of to implement your rule

12

because you have to go ask somebody for money.

13

And they're going to say yes or no,

14

and they're going to say yes or no in a tough

15

case depending upon what papers you show them.

16

That's called evidence.

17

MR. BREEMER:

It's -- it's --

part of the government to pay compensation

property.

19

I'm sorry if I

But there's no right to ask

At the time of that invasion, that's

20

what creates the liability, is there's a -- the

21

government has invaded your property and hasn't

22

given you anything or any guarantee of

23

compensation.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

But let me ask --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I suppose

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

--

2
3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- essentially the

same -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was going to

5

say, I suppose the way this most frequently

6

comes up is through a municipal ordinance or

7

something else like the, you know, enforcement

8

of the alleged property right in this case, and

9

there's no reason to suppose that the state is

10
11

going to give you any money at all.
They pass a law that says, well, for

12

example, you -- you know, you can't build a

13

garage on this property anymore or we no longer

14

have -- allow this particular type of

15

development.

16

And I suppose if they were going to

17

give you money, they would bring an eminent

18

domain proceeding or something of that sort.

19

But I think, in most cases that would arise,

20

there's no prospect of -- of payment.

21

MR. BREEMER:

That's right.

That's

22

exactly right.

And that's why the

23

understanding under Dow, Dickinson, and Kirby

24

is that, if there's a final injury, an invasion

25

of property, and there's no condemnation of it,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

that itself gives rise to your claim for

2

compensation.

3

Now the government can have --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why is that, Dr.

5

Breemer?

I mean, suppose that there were a

6

statute of the kind that the Chief Justice was

7

talking about, an invasion of a property

8

interest, and the statute actually said, or

9

maybe the statute didn't say, but the people

10

who were in charge of administering the statute

11

made an announcement that, if the regulatory

12

invasion of property came to a certain level,

13

invaded your property interests sufficiently,

14

they would entertain a request for money.

15
16

Can you just go into federal court
even though that's a possibility?

17

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, you could.

Under

18

Dow, the understanding is the invasion itself

19

gives rise to the claim for compensation.

20

so that wouldn't be sufficient because you

21

still have no entitlement.

22

been invaded.

23

injured.

24

guarantee of compensation.

25

Your property's

It's been harmed.

It's been

But you have no compensation, no

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Right.

I mean, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

think it's a -- so there are two things going

2

on here.

3

One is a more practical concern.

4

One is a more theoretical concern.

The theoretical concern is, why is

5

that true?

6

Clause to give rise to a claim when there's

7

been both an invasion of property and a refusal

8

to pay just compensation.

9

We've always understood the Takings

And so the theoretical problem that

10

your position has or at least the theoretical

11

question it raises is, well, you don't know

12

whether there has been a refusal of just

13

compensation because now we're in a situation

14

where it may be that the State will refuse, but

15

it may be that the State will actually give you

16

some money for the invasion.

17

So --

18

MR. BREEMER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

Right.
So that's the

theoretical problem.

21

MR. BREEMER:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
And then the practical

23

problem is, in this period where you don't know

24

whether the state is going to give you money or

25

not going to give you money -- it could, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

couldn't -- why should you be -- this is

2

Justice Breyer's concern -- you know, everybody

3

will just flock to federal courts and the

4

federal courts won't -- won't know what to do

5

with the case.

6

MR. BREEMER:

Right.

I understand

7

those -- the two different concerns.

The

8

problem I have is with the first premise.

9

You do know, when your property's

10

invaded by the government, it's taking the

11

benefit of invading your land and using it for

12

its purpose, and it hasn't given you

13

compensation or secured your compensation, you

14

are without just compensation at that time.

15

That's the original understanding

16

under Dow, Dickinson, Kirby, Clarke, all the

17

cases prior to Williamson County.

18

So it's not --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

exactly when the invasion occurs?

You do know.

21

MR. BREEMER:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

At that time just

Yes.
So, if the -- if the

23

State says we'll give you a check in a week,

24

you've been --

25

MR. BREEMER:

No.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- you've had a -- or

2

the State -- you know, the State says -- the

State says, we will decide in a week.

MR. BREEMER:

5

adequate under Cherokee Nation.

7

The first one is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's why I changed

it.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BREEMER:

The second one, no, see,

10

it -- it -- it's been confusing, this area, but

11

when you -- when you look at it, you have the

12

Dow is the original rule, the original rule of

13

Great Falls Manufacturing, the invasion itself,

14

when they don't condemn it, you have a claim

15

then.

16

And then Cherokee Nation created an

17

exception for the government.

Well, if you

18

secure compensation, then you --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But I'm -- I'm

20

suggesting -- I'm suggesting the government

21

doesn't know yet.

22

governments are slow.

23

to review the situation, to review the evidence

24

that you're going to give them.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Well -Do you have a claim, a

constitutional claim at that moment?

6

MR. BREEMER:

If the -- yes, if the

7

government is fast enough to go into your

8

property and declare it to be public access, at

9

that time, and take the benefit of it, without

10

condemning it or providing compensation, yes,

11

you have -- even if it thinks it might decide

later, yes, you have a compensation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.

All right.

The

federal government is permitted to pass a

7

regulation to take property and to rely on the

8

Tucker Act to have the claimant go into federal

9

court and ask for compensation.

There's no entitlement for you to stop

can't stop that from happening because you get

potential compensation in the Tucker Act.

to say that you have to exhaust that right of

that correct?

that.

There's an

That is a ripeness rule

and, yes, that ripeness rule will continue to

apply, but, for compensation purposes, it

16

doesn't.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

18

what's the difference between that and a state

saying, instead of going through the agency,

we're going to pick a decisionmaker, a judge,

MR. BREEMER:

I think I'm going to

20

answer really quickly because I'm losing time.

21

I think there's a misconception about how the

22

Tucker Act process works.

23

The Tucker Act and Section 1983 aren't

24

substantially different.

They both give

25

jurisdiction in a federal court.

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

difference is in how the Just Compensation

2

Clause is interpreted.

3

Under the Tucker Act, you have an

4

immediate claim for compensation, as soon as

5

the United States invades your private

6

property, in the designated federal court.

7

Under Williamson County, you do not have a

8

federal, Fifth Amendment claim.

9

interpreted differently.

It's

You have no complete

10

compensation entitlement until after state

11

remedies.

12

So the issue is not this court or that

13

court or this agency.

14

interpret the Fifth Amendment?

15

complete at the time of the invasion, you have

16

a federal question.

17

It's how are we going to
If it's

And you may go to state court.

It may

18

go to federal court.

19

And you -- yes, you have state remedies, but

20

you have state remedies everywhere, and it's

21

never been a requirement that you have a state

22

remedies exhaustion requirement if you already

23

have a complete federal question under

Section 1983, which you do here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. NOEL G. FRANCISCO

5

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

6
7
8
9
10
11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to make two basic points that
I think are responsive to much of the colloquy
that we've been having.
First, we think that Williamson

12

County's premise was correct, that the

13

government doesn't violate the Takings Clause

14

if it provides a mechanism for awarding

15

compensation after the fact.

16

But that doesn't justify Williamson

17

County's conclusion that a Section 1983 action

18

is not available to redress the deprivation of

19

the right to just compensation.

20

We think it's available to redress all

21

constitutional rights, including that one.

22

the right to just compensation is one that

23

vests the moment the property is taken.

24

why a property owner is entitled to interest

25

dating back to the moment of a taking.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

So a property owner, under

2

Section 1983, is quite literally deprived of

3

that right to compensation from the moment of

4

the taking until they get paid.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In this --

But this, General, is

6

-- is -- this is what you argued the first

7

time, that a property owner is deprived of a

8

constitutional right even before the

9

constitutional violation has taken place, is

10

that correct?

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

12

Your Honor, and, frankly --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct,

It -- it seems like a

14

sentence that you don't even -- you can't even

15

say without stumbling over it.

16

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I -- I -- I very

17

much disagree because, frankly, everybody here

18

agrees that these property owners can enforce

19

their constitutional right to just compensation

20

under the Fifth Amendment right now in a state

21

inverse condemnation action.

22

The only question is whether they have

23

to enforce that constitutional right in state

24

court first.

25

Fifth Amendment that says you have to go to

And there's simply nothing in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

state court before you go to federal court.

2

I think it's helpful to think --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is there any other

4

area in our law generally where somebody can go

5

to court under 1983, under anything else, and

6

say I've been deprived of a constitutional

7

right before a constitutional violation has

8

occurred?

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor,

10

the Tucker Act, and that was going to be my

11

next point.

12

I think it's useful to think of

13

Section 1983 in this context as similar to a

14

Tucker Act -- a Tucker Act claim.

15

redress the violation of a Fifth Amendment

16

right, but it does provide you with a mechanism

17

to enforce your Fifth Amendment right to just

18

compensation.

19

It doesn't

After all, the entire reason why a

20

property owner is entitled to interest dating

21

back to the moment of the taking is because

22

they're entitled to be compensated for the

23

entire period of their deprivation, the period

24

in which they have neither the property nor the

25

money.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but -- well,

2

but that right there seems to give the lie to

3

your argument.

4

deprivation of their property from the moment

5

it was taken.

You just talked about the

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.
That would suggest

8

that that's when the injury arises for

9

constitutional purposes and all purposes.

10

Again, I'm -- I'm with Justice Kagan, I can't

11

think of another area in the law where we have

12

this kind of artificial distinction that you're

13

proposing.

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, I think

15

you're right that there's not another area of

16

the law where you have this distinction.

17

think where I push back is that it's an

18

artificial distinction and, if I could explain,

19

because for most constitutional rights, there

20

is simply no difference between a deprivation

21

and a violation.

22

deprives you of your First Amendment rights,

23

for example, only when it violates the First

24

Amendment.

25

I

The government violates --

But the Takings Clause is uniquely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29

different because the right to just

2

compensation vests only when the government

acts lawfully.

taking of your property that triggers that

right, constitutional right, to just

compensation.

property.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

An implicit

premise of your argument and Petitioner's

14

Why is that, in your view?

a premise of the argument for overruling

that it's wrong, right?

something more, and --

There must be

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- I think the

implicit premise is that the state courts

aren't good enough in protecting rights.

It -- it is

statutory stare decisis, Your Honor, but I

still think that there are special

16

justifications for overturning it, principally

17

this Court has never actually explained

18

Williamson County's rationale, and as a result,

19

I think it has had the unintended consequence

20

of closing the federal courthouse doors to an

21

entire category of takings claimants, and

22

that's something I don't think Williamson

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Can I just get

more on what are the problems in state courts?

State courts are not doing a good job because?

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Again, Your Honor,

3

I am not here to take the position that today

4

state courts are not capable of resolving

5

takings claims.

6

today of state courts.

7

We do not have that criticism

But Section 1983 fundamentally

8

reflects the Reconstruction era Congress's

9

judgment.

And there's no basis for thinking

10

that the Reconstruction era Congress believed

11

that the right to just compensation is the one

12

area where we could trust state courts above

13

all others.

14

If, frankly, you think that that

15

judgment was wrong and it's -- and it's

16

available to this Court to go counter to it, I

17

think that you should probably overrule Patsy

18

as well, which rejected a state law exhaustion

19

requirement precisely because Section 1983 was

20

meant to provide a mechanism for accessing

21

federal court.

22

And, here, we think that property

23

owners, just like all other litigants who are

24

raising federal constitutional rights, should

25

have a federal avenue to redress those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33

2

constitutional rights.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

If we -- if we

3

agreed with your 1331 argument, is there any

4

practical difference in how things would

5

transpire?

6
7
8
9
10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think for the

most part -- and that -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Between that and

your 1983 argument?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yeah.

And that

11

was the point I was going to pivot to next.

12

think that you can effectively reach the same

13

result under our International College of

14

Surgeons Section 1331 argument, because, under

15

International College of Surgeons, this Court

16

made clear that if a state cause of action

17

pleads a federal takings claim as such, then

18

that federal takings claim presents a

19

substantial federal question that arises under

20

the Constitution for purposes of 1331.

21

And, yes, Justice Kavanaugh, I do

22

believe you can effectively reach the same

23

result through our International College of

24

Surgeons argument, and that does not require

25

you to overturn Williamson County.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

So we think there are essentially two

2

ways that you could go at this problem here.

3

One is to take on Williamson County directly

4

and overturn it.

And we do believe it was

5

wrongly decided.

But the other way is to

6

effectively reach the same result under our

7

International College of Surgeons argument.

8

In -- in either event, we do think

9

that the property owners here, like all other

10

constitutional litigants, should be given a --

11

a means to access federal courts.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a big

13

difference.

14

state provides a speedy and fair remedy where

15

they're going to pay the money, there is no

16

constitutional violation.

17

The -- the difference is that if a

And I can't think of a difference with

18

that.

19

you say that, of course, they have to have some

20

procedure for deciding whether there's a --

21

such a payment has been made or will in three

22

days be made.

23

And the trouble with that is that once

And once you say that, you're back

24

where you started because it's going to be a

25

state administrative procedure, possibly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

reviewable in state court, and then res

2

judicata may apply to that and, God knows,

3

we've accomplished nothing.

4
5
6

Now that is what's bothering me, but
you'll have an answer, which is why I ask you.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor,

7

because I think that your criticism is not

8

unique to takings litigation.

9

can always provide an administrative remedy to

10
11

I think states

redress constitutional claims.
But, in Patsy, this Court made clear

12

that you do not require litigants to exhaust

13

state remedies precisely because Section 1983

14

was predicated on the notion that litigants

15

should have a choice between federal and state

16

court because the Reconstruction era Congress

17

did not believe that state courts could be

18

fully entrusted to --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that.

There is

20

this difference.

But the Constitution itself

21

says that this violation isn't complete unless

22

they -- as long as they pay you.

23

isn't true of other state court -- I mean of

24

other -- of other constitutional, you know, and

25

there are loads of cases that say that.

And that

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's -- that's -Right.

All right.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So what

A couple of

responses --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

10

And I --

Yeah.
-- Your Honor.

My first response is that the right to

11

just compensation, regardless of whether

12

there's a violation, is one that vests

13

immediately.

14

federal government for a takings claim, you can

15

march into the claims court and -- and demand

16

just compensation in a ripe cause of action.

17

And it's also why these litigants can march

18

into state court tomorrow with a ripe cause of

19

action under the Fifth Amendment and demand

20

just compensation.

21

That's why, when you're suing the

So I do think that there's a

22

meaningful difference between the Takings

23

Clause and other constitutional provisions in

24

that regard and that, here, the right to just

25

compensation vests before there's a violation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

So I think it's -- it's helpful to think of

2

1983 and, frankly, to think of state inverse

3

condemnation actions as similar to a Tucker Act

4

claim.

They're all --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General?

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

You've expressed some

8

concerns about this Court's adopting

9

Mr. Breemer's argument.

10

What -- what exactly

are those concerns?

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So, at least as we

12

understand that argument, Mr. Breemer's

13

argument is that there's a constitutional

14

violation if the state takes property but

15

doesn't admit that it's a taking at the front

16

end.

17

Well, we -- we think that that's

18

contrary to the Tucker Act, and it would

19

effectively require federal government

20

officials to determine on the front end whether

21

their action constitutes a taking before they

22

proceed, since, after all -- may I finish, Your

23

Honor?

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

Since, after all,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

federal government officials are duty bound not

2

to violate the Constitution.

3

We don't think that's required because

4

the Tucker Act constitutes an implicit promise

to pay in the event that there is a taking.

Section 1983 action is available.

and may it please the Court:

17

The Williamson County decision, which

18

is at issue here, needs some context that I

19

think will answer some of the questions we've

20

been hearing, because the presentation of

21

Williamson County as something that completely

22

changed an existing landscape is simply not

23

true.

24
25

And I think it all -- this -- this
point will also answer the question about the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

justification for the rule.

2

this area, the sea change was the Monell

3

decision when this Court decided that

4

municipalities could be sued under

5

Section 1983.

6

The big change in

Before that, none of this was an issue

7

because a takings claim against a municipality

8

would be that claim in state court for

9

compensation.

10

In Williamson County, this Court first

11

time had to address sort of the marrying of two

12

long-standing doctrines for the first time.

13

One was a claim under Section 1983 relying upon

14

a deprivation of constitutional rights, a

15

required element of Section 1983.

16

long-standing doctrine is that the Fifth

17

Amendment is not violated, a property owner is

18

not deprived of any rights under the Fifth

19

Amendment where the government has provided a

20

reasonable, certain, and adequate means to

21

recover just compensation.

22

The other

And that is not dependent -- this

23

Court has never made it dependent upon whether

24

or not the government admitted to the taking.

state government with the judicial branch of

7

the state government.

8

right, but this is the situation that is

9

troubling to me.

10

So -- and maybe that's

The -- a municipality enacts a

11

regulation, and the property owner says:

12

this regulation goes so far it completely

13

deprives my property of any value.

14

taking of my property.

15

Wow,

This is a

And goes to the municipality and says:

16

You have effectively taken my property.

17

you pay me just compensation?

18

Will

And the municipality, speaking for the

19

executive branch of the Commonwealth of

20

Pennsylvania or whatever state is involved,

21

says:

22

you one penny.

23

Absolutely not.

We're not going to pay

Now, of course, if you want to take us

24

to court, we're going to fight you tooth and

25

nail all the way through the state court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

system, and if in the end you get a judgment

2

that says that there was a taking and you're

3

entitled to a certain amount of just

4

compensation, we're going to pay that.

5

Now you're saying that there has been

6

no violation of the Takings Clause until the

7

end of that state court litigation, right?

8
9

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

We are saying there

has been no constitutional violation until

10

there is a -- a failure to provide the process

11

for recovering just compensation.

12

So where the state provides that

13

process, and in the -- I think following up on

14

Your Honor's example, it's what Pennsylvania

15

does, and there's no constitutional reason a

16

state can't do what Pennsylvania does, the

17

responsibility for adjudicating whether or not

18

a taking has occurred at all and what

19

compensation is due can be delegated to the

20

state courts.

That's perfectly appropriate.

21

And it certainly makes perfect sense

22

in the regulatory situation like we're facing

23

here, I think for the very reason that Justice

24

Breyer posited that this Court has recognized

25

many times.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

Regulatory enactments pose the most

2

difficult issues for this Court as to when they

3

are and are not a taking.

4

there are so many different ways property

5

rights could be affected, there are so many

6

different properties that could be affected,

7

they're very individual.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even for this Court,

All right.

If you're

a lawyer advising a municipality about a

10

proposed regulation that might cause property

11

owners to litigate the question of whether

12

there was a regulatory taking and demand just

13

compensation, would you not try to determine

14

whether those might be valid and, therefore,

15

how much money your municipality might be out

16

of if they went ahead with that regulation?

17

You would just plow ahead with the

18

regulation and say:

Well, you know, we don't

19

really know, and we don't really care, and if

20

at the end of this litigation process it ends

21

up costing us $20 million, so be it.

22

Is that what you would do?

23

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Your Honor, what I

24

would -- what I would advise the municipality

25

is that they can rely upon this Court's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

decisions going back to the Hayes case and all

2

the way back to Cherokee Nation, that if a

3

regulatory taking turns out in some

4

unanticipated way, a reg -- I'm sorry, a

5

regulation turns out in some unanticipated way

6

to effect a taking, the enactment is,

7

nevertheless, constitutional because the state

8

already has a process in place that is complete

9

and thorough and will provide the compensation.

10

And if the property owner does go to

11

state court on something that the state or the

12

municipality did not think was a taking and the

13

court says it is, the court will assign

14

compensation and the municipality will pay.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're really telling

16

me that you would -- you're telling me you

17

would not tell the municipality:

18

think about the budgetary consequences of what

19

you're doing?

20

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

You ought to

Well, Your Honor, I

21

think that -- I -- I assume that every

22

municipality certainly in these days has to

23

think about the budgetary consequences of what

24

they're doing, but I think your question is, in

25

enacting a regulation, do they have to assume

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

that it's going to be unconstitutional if they

2

don't pay upfront, because that's the argument.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there -- is -- is

4

there some kind of middle position here?

5

mean, it's an unusual provision.

6

for compensation.

7

to give the compensation, no problem.

8

there has to be some method of finding out

9

whether there is or is not compensation owed.

10

I

It provides

And so, if the state's going
And

But hasn't the court said something

11

like the state system has to be fair to do that

12

thing it promises to do, and what about adding

13

speedy?

14

worried about is that, that they're tied up

15

forever in the state courts and then they can't

16

even get to federal court.

17

I mean, I think what people are

But could you say where the state

18

doesn't have a speedy, fair system for

19

determining whether there's compensation or

20

not, then you can go into federal court?

21

would be totally practical but not -- but not

22

beyond the words of the Constitution in this

23

area.

24
25

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

That

And I think that is

already inherent, Your Honor.

And -- and we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

agree in the Section 1983 test because there

2

has to be that reasonable, certain, adequate

3

process.

If you file --

if I file one of these cases, I -- well, in

16

this case, Ms. Knick says you're violating her

17

property rights because your rule is people get

18

to walk all over land to go see the old

19

gravestones, and she brings a suit.

20

How long would it take her to get a

21

decision through the Pennsylvania Supreme

22

Court?

23

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Well, it would have

24

been over before now, Your Honor.

But I think

25

the important part is where it starts because I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

don't think we can assume that the state court

2

wouldn't properly apply the law at the outset.

more generous than the Tucker Act.

As

a practical matter, you're also talking about

requiring local municipalities to, instead of

litigating cases that do come up close to home,

they're -- you're now adding an additional

benefit of litigating a constitutional

And when you're talking about a lot of

municipalities and a lot of regulations,

for the Respondent here -- this is a small,

I don't think that there would be any

you would go through the state system, and if

you were dissatisfied, then you would have a

I think the difficulty with your

position is not Williamson, which says go to

says that the federal courts are going to be

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

No.

No, Your

Justice Kagan was asking about how do we

address this, I think that the way to address

it is what this Court did in San Remo, which is

clarify what the rule is.

exhaustion requirement.

in state court but not in federal?

16

How come that applies

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because it -- I --

17

I think that the -- that the difference that

18

I'm trying to point out, Your Honor, is that

19

it's an element of the Section 1983 cause of

20

action that does not give such a claimant an

21

automatic right to be in federal court because

22

they don't have a constitutional --

business of saying exhaustion here, I guess I'm

at a loss as to why we wouldn't say exhaustion

And -- and to try

to answer that, Your Honor, I -- I just have to

disagree with the -- the calculus of exhaustion

that.

And 1331 should not be

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What about 1331?

Yes, 13 -- what about the 1331 argument?
MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because 1331 has --

6

has been always treated by this Court as for

7

special cases under state law, the -- the

8

unusual case that doesn't upset the

9

constitutional balance of authority that

10
11

Congress has created.
Allowing every plaintiff in every

12

takings case in every county or municipality to

13

go straight to federal court would certainly

14

upset that balance, but it'll also -- this

15

would not be the case to even consider that

question, Your Honor, because, in this case,

there is no state takings claim.

But -- but, in

terms of the law on 1331, if we were to so

hold, as the Solicitor General argues, then

Congress, of course, could trim that back.

their argument is 1331, at least as interpreted

by our precedent, does allow a certain narrow

category of state law claims to be directly

brought in federal court, and the question is

2

what -- why is that wrong and what problems

3

would that create, in your view?

4

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because every claim

5

that involves a federal element is not a case

6

arising under federal law for Section 1331

7

purposes, at least as this Court has ever

8

interpreted it.

9

For the reason that it would not fall

10

within that special category of cases, it would

11

be every case.

12

in federal court.

13

jurisdiction has been interpreted by this Court

14

much more narrowly.

Every state case would now be
And Section 1331

15

And, again, Congress could fix that.

16

Congress could enact Section 1331(a) and give

17

-- or whatever, and give state takings

18

claimants, just looking for compensation, a

19

route straight to federal court.

20

But Congress has not done that.

And

21

this Court should not do that by modifying or

22

creating a whole different interpretation of

23

federal court jurisdiction.

And then suppose you

I mean, suppose you

And to answer that

question --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Yeah.
-- yes, I think

23

that that -- that the court -- Congress could

24

say that.

1983 --

And I actually think that Section

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why couldn't we

2

say that in interpreting -- in interpreting

3

when this unusual hybrid taking plus no

4

compensation becomes ripe for adjudication?

5
6

MS. FICKEN SACHS:
Court, Your Honor --

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Yeah, but not for one

of those reasons, but I mean --

9
10

You're the Supreme

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

-- but in Section

1983 -JUSTICE BREYER:

-- ripeness is --

12

ripeness is a fairly -- ripeness is the kind of

13

issue that judges do decide.

14

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

But -- but I -- I

15

think, perhaps, although you could do that, it

16

would not be necessary where Section 1983 would

17

already provide that claim.

18

A claimant could say my state process

19

doesn't -- there's no existing state process

20

that's reasonable, certain, and adequate, or

21

they could even later, at the conclusion of a

22

state case, perhaps, say, as applied to my

23

case, this process was not reasonable, certain,

24

and adequate means to just compensation.

25

That's a Section 1983 claim because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

it's a constitutional violation.

2

already have a cause of action over which

3

Congress has given the federal courts

4

jurisdiction, and no need to -- to jump in and

5

reinterpret this Court's existing jurisprudence

6

on Section 1331.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So then we

Do you have any --

8

have you given any thought to the possibility

9

that if you lose this case, that a 1983

10

plaintiff could go into federal court and

11

enjoin the municipality from enforcing a

12

regulation?

13

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

And that is one of the problems, I think, that,

15

when we were talking earlier about how the

16

municipalities have -- have depended on -- on

17

the current interpretation to -- that there's

18

no takings -- no federal takings claim until

19

there's a violation --

20
21
22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a

normal -MS. FICKEN SACHS:

-- the Constitution

Go ahead,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, an

2

injunction is a high bar because money can --

3

if money can --

4

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
-- make you whole,

6

you can't get an injunction.

7

certainly see people arguing that money can't

8

make them whole because whatever it is that

9

they have is unique and not compensable by

10

money, presumably.

11

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13
14

But I can

It certainly -Some people could

argue that on some pieces of property.
MS. FICKEN SACHS:

I agree, Your

15

Honor, that is certainly a danger.

16

one of the reasons why being able to rely upon

17

the state process to ensure that no

18

constitutional violation ever happens also

19

prohibits or -- or shortcuts any possibility of

20

a Section 1983 claim seeking to enjoin a

21

violation.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And it is

Counsel, when we're

23

talking about stare decisis, not only have we

-- the courts often said, of course, that money

relief in just these sorts of cases, but an

2

additional factor for me is Williamson

purported to interpret the Constitution.

4

You're now not arguing that.

You're

5

saying 1983.

6

about the Constitution, though, at least as I

7

read it.

So help me out with that, number one.

Williamson County was talking

other law that's developed around it, including

First English, which this Court has held that

the deprivation of the right takes place

immediately.

16
17
18

It's very briefly

And it's inconsistent with a lot of

So all of those factors seem to weigh
against you.

What do we do about that?

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Justice Gorsuch,

19

let me go back to the -- the first part of your

20

question, which is the -- the violation under

21

Williamson County, and was Williamson County

22

talking about the Constitution or Section 1983.

23
24
25

And I would respectfully disagree
because the entire definition -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

Assume you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

wrong on that.

Then what?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

I'm sorry?
Assuming I disagree

with you on that, then what?

6

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

I would say that

7

you still have to have a constitutional

8

violation.

9

claim --

10

And in Williamson County, the only

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The precedential

11

force, you would concede, if Williamson County

12

was interpreting the Constitution, the

13

precedential force is diminished when you're

14

arguing only it's a matter of interpreting

15

1983, right?

16

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Statutory -- well,

17

actually, statutory decisis has a stronger --

18

yes, stronger stare decisis effect.

19

were only constitutional, I would agree with

20

Your Honor.

21

So, if it

But that, again, that's a -- that's a

22

supposition because the only claim raised in

23

Williamson County, just like the only claim

24

raised in this case, was a Section 1983 claim.

25

And so, to answer Your Honor's second

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

question about whether Williamson County was

2

well reasoned, it is when you put it back in

3

that context.

4

The context was, has a constitutional

5

violation been identified?

6

constitutional violation because the petitioner

7

there had not been deprived of a reasonable,

8

certain, and adequate means of getting

9

compensation.

10

And there was no

And, therefore, there is -- that that

11

was the -- that -- that marrying of the two

12

doctrines that I talked about before.

13

Court did talk about the constitutional

14

requirements and what would violate the Fifth

15

Amendment, but they found that a Section 1983

16

violation had not occurred.

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The

If Williamson

18

County is wrong, you argue that it still should

19

not be overruled.

20

Why?

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Your Honor, because

21

the -- the -- the underlying principles of

22

Williamson County are what municipalities have

23

relied upon.

24
25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And how do they

rely on them?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

They've relied upon

2

them by enacting litigation -- I'm sorry,

3

regulations, ordinances, statutes, knowing that

4

they cannot be attacked as unconstitutional for

5

failing to provide just compensation.

6

They -- they know that --

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

8

they can be attacked in state court.

9

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Well, they know

They can -- they

10

can be -- compensation can be requested, but

11

the enactments are not rendered

12

unconstitutional by failing to provide just

13

compensation.

14

And that's a really important

15

difference.

16

questions here before about -- about regulatory

17

takings and their difficulty.

18

And it goes back to one of the

I think it's -- it's important just to

19

keep in mind that when this Court found in the

20

Mahon case in 1922 that the -- the doc -- sort

21

of created the doctrine of regulatory takings

22

in the first place, it was against an existing

23

backdrop of the Hayes case, just two years

24

earlier, where this Court held that a -- an

25

inverse condemnation action was a reasonable,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

certain, and adequate method for obtaining

2

compensation, even where the government, as it

3

did in that case, denied that there was any

4

taking.

5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

This Court has held that many times
since then and -JUSTICE ALITO:

You've totally -- you

totally lost me in your explanation on what -MS. FICKEN SACHS:
JUSTICE ALITO:

I'll --

-- where -- where the

municipal reliance is.
MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because if -- if

13

the -- if municipalities -- the reliance, I

14

guess, maybe I can say it's on the front end,

15

Your Honor.

16

going to federal court or state court.

It's not on the back end, are they

17

It's on the front end.

18

enactments constitutional or are they not

19

constitutional?

20

Are their

And we know that their --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and that's going

21

to be decided if it's -- you know, if the

22

property owner disagrees, it's going to be

23

contested in state court or in federal court.

24

I -- I don't understand the

25

difference.

What's -- where's the reliance,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

other than reliance on the fact that, well, if

2

we go ahead with this, at least we're going to

3

get -- and -- and it's challenged, at least

4

it's going to be in our own courts.

5

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because the basis

6

of the challenge would be different, Your

7

Honor.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, it won't.

How is

it different?

10

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Because, under

11

Section 1983, the claim is that the

12

municipality has already violated the

13

Constitution.

14

condemnation action, it's a claim for -- for

15

compensation.

And the -- under a state inverse

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But you conceded --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH: -- that there is a

Ms. Evans --

19

violation of the Constitution.

I mean, you

20

acknowledge that the violation of the

21

Constitution is complete.

So --

22

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

23

I -- if I said that, let me back up.

24

injury, there is an injury, but there is --

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, Your Honor.

If

The

Well, I -- I -- I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

sure I heard that, and I'm quite sure I heard

2

that, counsel, that you said the problem here

3

is that there's no 1983 cause of action.

4

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

Correct.
Not that there's a

violation of the Constitution, absence of that.

7

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

8

of action requires violation of the

9

Constitution, Your Honor.

10

The 1983 cause

So I -- I don't

know -- if I missaid that, let me say it again.

11
12

No.

A 1983 action requires a violation of
the Constitution.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Surely, but, again,

14

counsel, I -- I -- I'm pretty sure I heard

15

earlier --

16

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.
-- that -- you

18

acknowledge that there's a violation of the

19

Constitution upon the taking and the failure to

20

provide compensation.

21

English, right?

22

We said as much in First

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

No.

No, only when

23

there's not -- yeah, where there's no process

24

provided.

25

there's no process provided, then yes.

And I agree with Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If
The

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

taking and the violation happen at the same

2

time.

3

But the -- the -- the injury, that's

4

the taking, is not the same as the violation.

5

And I think that is really important to keep in

6

mind because I think there's been a lot of

7

conflating of those two terms in talking about

8

a federal takings claim versus a constitutional

9

-- a claim for a constitutional violation.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and, Ms. Sachs,

11

tell me if I'm wrong, but I understood the

12

argument you were just making as very similar

13

to the General's argument, at the end of his

14

argument, where he said if -- if Mr. Breemer's

15

theory were accepted, it would put employees of

16

the government in a very ticklish situation

17

because, at a much earlier time, you would be

18

forcing employees to say we're going to go

19

invade the Constitution.

20
21
22

Isn't that right?

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

Yes.

Correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So you are adopting

23

the government's view on this score?

24

MS. FICKEN SACHS:

25

On -- on -- we --

we are in agreement with the government with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
71
1

respect to the -- the fact that a -- an inverse

2

condemnation action provides what the

3

Constitution requires.

4

I think the Solicitor General says it

5

provides what the Constitution requires, all

6

that the Takings Clause requires under the

7

Fifth Amendment, and yet somehow the Solicitor

8

General says that's not true when a state does

9

the same thing.

10

And that's where we greatly

disagree.

11

The Section 1983 provides remedies

12

coextensive with the Fourteenth Amendment.

13

Fourteenth Amendment does not put greater

14

burdens on the state than it does on the

15

federal government.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. DAVID BREEMER

24
25

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BREEMER:

Thank you.

May it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
72
1

please the Court:

2

I want to talk about state courts real

3

quickly.

One of the problems in just saying,

4

well, it's a wash and you can bring your Fifth

5

Amendment claim in state court, so what's the

6

problem, is you can't bring your Fifth

7

Amendment claim in a state court.

8

Williamson County says this:

9

Amendment Takings Clause claim exists until you

10

No Fifth

use a state law inverse condemnation process.

11

In federal court or state court, it

12

does not exist, while over in the court of

13

claims it does exist.

14

use that state law inverse condemnation

15

process, it's different in every state.

16

And since you have to

There are different procedures,

17

different rules.

18

that state law procedure, you don't have a

19

Fifth Amendment claim.

20

Compensation Clause different?

21

And until you go through all

But why is a Just

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Is the substance

22

of the claim any different from the takings

23

claim?

24
25

MR. BREEMER:
yes.

In many case, it is,

In state law inverse condemnation cases,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
73
1

in many cases, it is.

2

to file a writ of mandate action first before

3

you can bring that inverse condemnation.

4

Inverse condemnation requires that initial writ

5

of mandate action to try and invalidate.

6

Section 1983 doesn't require that.

7

Just Compensation Clause doesn't require that.

8

In many states, you have

And

And the

The other point I would like to make

9

real quickly is that the government doesn't

10

have to consider every regulation to see if

11

it's a taking unless it wants the benefit of

12

the Cherokee Nation exception.

13

benefit for the government to say, oh, we're

14

going to consider if it's a taking, and -- and

15

admit it and provide a process.

16

burden.

17

That's a

That's not a

That's a benefit.
It can go under the regular rule, just

18

like every other constitutional provision, and

19

decide, look, we're going to do this, final

20

act, it may harm some people --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What happens --

22

what happens when the government says, yes, the

23

graveyard municipality ordinance requires

24

compensation.

25

living there gets compensation.

Everybody who has some person

MR. BREEMER:

That's the --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now somebody comes

3

in and says, I have my goldfish or my dog

4

buried there.

5

for the people who want to come visit -- the

6

prior owners who want to visit the dog

9

Why shouldn't I get compensation

Well, that person can go to federal

MR. BREEMER:

10

No, I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even though the

11

state has said we'll pay compensation for a

12

13

MR. BREEMER:

If the -- when the state

14

says we'll pay compensation for a specific act,

15

that's Cherokee Nation.

There's no

That's why there's

So why can't the

state just come in and say we will pay just

22

compensation to anyone who's been injured by

MR. BREEMER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

You --

Can I answer?
You may -- you

may answer briefly.

MR. BREEMER:

Because we're talking

about the Fifth Amendment.

remedies for many, many injuries, but there are

also federal remedies.

There are state

And the Fifth Amendment stands on its

own in that the just compensation is complete
