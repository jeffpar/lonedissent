We'll hear

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The IOIA gives international

12

organizations "the same immunity from suit as

13

is enjoyed by foreign governments."

14

The plain text of this provision,

15

coupled with the structure of the IOIA and the

16

drafting history, make clear that the same

17

immunity provision gives international

18

organizations the same immunity that foreign

19

governments are entitled to today under the

20

Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.

21

Starting with the text, my opponents

22

do not dispute that, as a general rule, when a

23

statutory provision refers to another body of

24

law, especially, as here, in the present tense,

25

that body of law is incorporated as of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

moment of suit in any given case.

2

And, indeed, they don't dispute -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the -- the

4

hornbooks that I looked up, I mean, going back

5

forever, don't say quite that.

6

true as long as the changes are consistent with

7

the purpose of the adopting statute.

8

indeed, the Indian case, you know, the word was

9

"now," was it now 1934 or now later?

They say that's

And,

In the

10

case we wrote last term that Justice Gorsuch

11

wrote, the word was "monetary relief."

12

that mean as of the past, or does it mean what

13

we call money relief now?

14

many cases like that.

15

Does

I mean, there are

And here the word is "is."

Does the

16

word "is" refer to the past, is at the moment a

17

passage, or later?

18

like you to address that are opposite you are,

19

one, states do many things, nations, many, many

20

things, and so, if we take immunity from them

21

for commercial things, we leave lots of

22

immunity with them for those other things.

23

The two arguments that I'd

But international organizations, some

24

of them, do only one thing:

25

equivalent.

lend money or the

And if we take immunity from them,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

that's the end of the immunity or close.

2

That's one argument.

3

The second is this:

If we decide

4

against you, and we've made a mistake, or along

5

comes a case where they really should have

6

immunity, the President and the State

7

Department can give it to them.

8
9

If we decide with you, well, if along
comes a case where they should enjoy the

10

immunity, no, nobody can do anything.

11

say that correctly?

12

argument -­

Have you got the

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Did I

Okay.
-- or have I said it

backwards?

16

MR. FISHER:

No, no, no.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. FISHER:

Did I say it right?

So I think you gave me

19

two things and then one before it, which was

20

the statutory text.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

That's right.

So let me start with the

23

statutory text, Justice Breyer.

And the word

24

"is" in this Court's jurisprudence always,

25

always means at the time of suit, not at the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

time the statute was passed.

2

reams of cases to that effect.

3

cite only one case on the other side, that's an

4

Armed Career Criminal Act case.

5

"is" didn't mean at the time of suit; it meant

6

at the time of the prior conviction.

7

is on our side of this case.

8
9

And we've cited
My opponents

Even there,

So "is"

But, in Carcieri, which is the "now"
case, the Indian case, the Court went out of

10

its way in that opinion to say the insertion of

11

the word "now" takes us out of the ordinary

12

situation, which is when the referenced law

13

applies at the time of suit.

14

look at the Sutherland treatise, which dates

15

back to 1904, on this principle.

16

And so you can

And look at its -- in -- in your own

17

case, Justice Breyer, I think if I was going to

18

give you one case, it would be the Steamboat

19

versus Chase case we cite in our reply brief.

20

That's interpreting the Judiciary Act, which

21

goes all the way back to the founding, of

22

course, and says where the common law is

23

competent to give a remedy, such and such a

24

remedy is permissible.

25

And in Steamboat, the Court rejected

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

the exact argument the other side makes here,

2

which is, first of all, that the law had to be

3

incorporated at the time of suit and, second of

4

all, that there was something different about

5

the common law as to a statute at the time of

6

the enactment.

7

in our favor.

8
9

So all of the textual stuff is

Now you've also asked me two other
questions and let me address them.

So starting

10

with the commercial activity exception as

11

applied to a group like the IFC, when you

12

answer -- when you think of that question, it's

13

a question of how close you -- you put the lens

14

into what's going on here.

15

So if you just take a foreign state as

16

the -- as the comparator here, a foreign state

17

itself does all kinds of things.

18

said, Justice Breyer, they are not commercial

19

activity.

20

bank, for example, that does almost all

21

commercial activity.

22

Like you

But a foreign state might have a

And so the same thing is true with

23

international organizations, and let me answer

24

that in a few different steps.

25

all, look at the sweep of international

So, first of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

organizations.

2

for example, managing fisheries.

3

things like dispute resolution, law

4

enforcement, Interpol.

5

research and agricultural research.

6

those things are non-commercial activities on

7

the other side.

8
9

Many do things like regulation,
They do

They do scientific
All of

Then you have the category, the
special category, of lending banks, but even

10

within lending banks, not all the things that

11

lending banks do are commercial activity.

12

IFC itself on its website talks about how it

13

gives advice to foreign governments about

14

legislation that ought to be passed regulating

15

financial transactions with the private sector.

16

That is not probably commercial activity.

The

17

And then, even within lending

18

activities, Justice Breyer, just take the World

19

Bank, it has five separate institutions.

20

the IFC is on one side.

21

-- is loan money at market rates for profit for

22

private sector projects.

23

components of the World Bank and there are

24

other lending institutions that are

25

international organizations that give grants

Now

What the IFC does is

There are other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

for public works programs or that do the kind

2

of spending that governments do.

3

government's argued in past cases, and we think

4

they're probably right, that that is not

5

commercial activity either.

6

And the

So, when the other side says, well,

7

everything is commercial activity, it's no

8

different than the foreign state coming to this

9

and saying, well, if the Bank of Switzerland

10

does commercial activity, then we're -- we're

11

stuck.

12

you look at the problem.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no, no, no, it's just how closely

What about -- the

14

third was if we -- if we decide with you -- if

15

we decide against you, see, that would mean

16

there is sovereign immunity.

17

shouldn't be in a particular case, the State

18

Department can waive it and they have to be -­

19

response.

20

But there

But if we decide for you, and then

21

there's a case where there really shouldn't be

22

sovereign immunity or, rather -- rather, there

23

really should be, I guess -- see, that's what

24

I'm getting mixed up.

25

against you and they really should have

You see, if we decide

sovereign immunity in this case, nobody can do

2

anything.

3

future, it seems a little safer, the first,

4

than the second.

5

So, knowing nothing about the

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm going to turn

6

back in a moment to the law and why that just

7

can't fit within the law, but as to just the

8

policy question you're asking me, even there -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you can look -­

10

the reason I ask policy questions is because

11

the hornbook said, yes, apply it as of now as

12

long as it's consistent with the purpose of the

13

statute.

14

back to 1945 and the U.N. and everything, was

15

to get these organizations to locate here.

16

And the purpose of the statute, going

So it's not just policy for policy.

17

It's policy for purpose.

18

into how you interpret the language.

19
20
21

MR. FISHER:

And purpose is tied

So let me give you the

practical answer and then the purpose answer.
On the practical answer,

22

organizations, especially if they want a

23

headquarter here or are headquartered here, are

24

fully able to -- to lobby Congress or the

25

executive branch for special immunity.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

there are many examples across international

2

organizations.

3

Take the Organization of American

4

States, OAS.

5

discusses this in -- the organization in its

6

brief.

7

immunity provision for itself to get more than

8

the ordinary restrictive form of immunity that

9

was available under the IOIA.

10

And the Solicitor General

In 1994, it negotiated a special

So there are -- there are pathways

11

available, and they have been used even more

12

so.

13

Remember, the United States, as you

14

say, has a -- has a sometimes principal

15

interest in these organizations.

16

quite responsive to them when they come and

17

say:

18

So it is

We need more than the IOIA gives us.
But, Justice Breyer, let me turn back

19

to the -- the original purpose, which was the

20

legislative history is quite clear on what the

21

purpose was.

22

create a form of immunity to give some comfort

23

to these organizations.

24

what form of immunity did they ask for and what

25

did they get?

As you say, this was partly to

But the question is,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

What they did is they came to Congress

2

and said treat us like foreign governments.

3

Give us immunity, as Congress put it in a

4

Senate report, of a governmental nature.

5

so what did Congress do?

6

what they asked for.

7

treat you as a default measure like a foreign

8

government.

9

And

It gave them exactly

It said we're going to

And, remember, the words of the

10

statute are "same immunity."

11

as is enjoyed by federal governments.

12

going to give you the same immunity, subject to

13

the President's ability to just -- adjust it

14

and subject to your own ability and your own

15

treaty to negotiate for more, and subject,

16

thirdly, to Congress's ability to give you some

17

immunity that you don't have even by way of

18

your own treaty.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

"Same immunity"
So we're

Can we go to that

20

issue raised in part?

The special immunity, I

21

know, was even negotiated by the U.N., I think,

22

in the 1990s, and OAS and others, but assume

23

that we're in your regiment, and Justice Breyer

24

made the assumption that if a lawsuit came to

25

us now under your theory, and it was limited

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

immunity, that the President or Congress could

2

give immunity to the other side.

3

I don't think so.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

No, it's the

opposite.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

President can't decrease it, correct?

8

problem still remains with your -­

9

MR. FISHER:

The opposite.

So that

Well -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

-- I think it -- it may

12

or may not remain, Justice Sotomayor.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. FISHER:

That's my -­

Certainly, we could -- we

15

would say we can go forward on this suit

16

because -- because there is no such law.

17

If that law were passed, you'd have

18

two questions.

19

retroactive?

20

about how to judge the retroactivity of

21

immunity provisions.

22

retroactive, whether that were permissible.

23

The

One is, did Congress make it
And you look to Altmann to think

And then, if it were

But, you know, we're a long way from

24

-- from that sort of a situation.

I think the

25

important thing going forward -- and this is, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

think, what the concern is on the other side,

2

is not so much about this case but about

3

incentives and policies going forward -- they

4

have every opportunity to negotiate in one form

5

or another or to procure a heightened form of

6

immunity.

7

And, Justice Sotomayor, let me say one

8

more thing to you and Justice Breyer about, you

9

know, the idea of the executive branch getting

10

involved.

This is one of the problems, I

11

submit, with the other side's argument.

12

Remember, part of the goal of the FSIA

13

in the first section of the Act in Section 1602

14

is to get -- is to get the executive branch out

15

of the immunity business.

16

Congress made the determination that

17

it was a bad idea to have every case turning on

18

individualized suggestions of immunity and

19

executive branch political policy.

20

other side, by importing the common law of

21

1945, would reintroduce that problem into

22

international organization immunity in a way

23

that we don't think would be very good

24

politically or very workable in the courts.

25

And so the

And I'd hasten to add that even under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

the rule of 1945, if the question were what

2

does the executive branch think about any given

3

lawsuit or any given immunity for any given

4

type of suit, that would just lead you right

5

back to the FSIA, and it would lead you back to

6

the same conclusion that we submit to you here.

7

So either pathway, whether, Justice

8

Breyer, you start with the way you've always

9

looked at cases, with the word "is" and the

10

word "same" and the reference canon that I've

11

described and say all of those things lead you

12

to a time of suit rule, or if you start with

13

the law of 1945 and say, what was the law in

14

1945?

15

Well, Hoffman and -- in Ex Parte Peru

16

were clear that the law of 1945 was the

17

executive branch decides, and it's not for the

18

Court -- this is -- I'm going to give you the

19

Court's own language -- it's not for the Court

20

to give immunity where the executive branch has

21

not seen fit to give it.

22

And if that were the test, you'd come

23

right back to where you -- where I started

24

here, which is that the FSIA would control or,

25

at the bare minimum, the executive branch

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

position in this lawsuit on the type of

2

immunity that ought to apply in this situation

3

would control.

4

So -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Fisher, if I can

5

pick up on Justice Breyer's question.

6

reference canon, I take all -- all of your

7

points, but sometimes, let's say we have a

8

statute that -- that refers to another statute.

9

The

Usually, we would look at the second

10

statute that's being incorporated as of the

11

time of -- of the adoption of the first

12

statute.

13

to say go look at Section 5 -­

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right?

So if -- if this statute were

Right.
-- we wouldn't look

16

at it the way it's been subsequently amended.

17

We'd look at it as it was originally enacted in

18

1945.

19

Why isn't that -- that idea pertinent

20

here, you know, when we refer to a specific

21

law, we don't take it to evolve over time?

22

MR. FISHER:

So for two reasons,

23

Justice Gorsuch, and one of them, if you'll

24

forgive me, is going to be something you said

25

in the Alan Contoe opinion.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1
2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I was afraid of

that.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. FISHER:

But for two reasons.

One

5

is Congress has a choice to make when it writes

6

legislation.

7

setting a specific statutory provision and says

8

that's the rule we want, just like if Congress

9

uses a particular word, at the time of the

It can lock in a given rule by

10

enactment, the meaning of that word at the time

11

of enactment would be what Congress -- we'd

12

assume Congress wanted.

13

Or Congress could do something

14

different, which is to say, look, we're not

15

sure exactly of the metes and bounds of the -­

16

of the law.

17

other area of law as a general matter.

18

that's what Congress did here.

19

latter.

20

We're just going to tie it to this
And

It did the

So it took an area of law as a point

21

of reference and said:

22

default rule and then adjust as necessary.

23

those are just two different pathways Congress

24

can go down.

25

Just use that as the
And

And they date, as I said, all the way

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

back to the First Judiciary Act there, in the

2

Sutherland treatise, all the way back to 1904,

3

and so there's just two different pathways

4

Congress can go down.

5

And it makes perfect sense, I think,

6

in a situation like this, especially where you

7

have a common law doctrine being referenced, at

8

least a common law at the time, and one that

9

was, indeed, not just any old common law

10

doctrine but one that was in a great deal of

11

flux at the time.

12

it made every good reason for Congress to have

13

a general reference, not a specific one.

So it made every reason -­

14

And then the second reason, Justice

15

Gorsuch, is the one you mentioned sitting on

16

the Tenth Circuit, which is that, as time goes

17

by, it becomes all the more stilted or

18

antiquated or even foolish sometimes to try to

19

answer questions in the modern day according to

20

what some bygone era doctrine would have

21

required, and especially a bygone era doctrine

22

like this.

23

If I understand the other side's

24

position correctly, basically, the question

25

they're having -- they would want every federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

court to ask in these cases is, what would the

2

Truman Administration's State Department have

3

wanted to do in this case?

4

And when you have things like this,

5

which didn't even -- an organization that

6

didn't even exist at the time, sometimes doing

7

activities that weren't even contemplated at

8

the time, things like sovereign wealth funds,

9

which foreign sovereigns now engage in, for

10

example, who knows what the State Department

11

would have thought then.

12

I think there's every reason then to

13

fall back on the reference canon.

14

say one more thing before reserving my time, if

15

you have any doubt about just the plain text

16

argument I've given you, I would urge you to

17

compare the text in Section 288a to the text -­

18

Section 288d, which has the exact dichotomy

19

that -- that I've been discussing today.

20

And if I can

One subsection, subsection (a), says

21

that the same immunity rules apply, and

22

subsection (b) says that foreign officials -­

23

I'm sorry, international organization officials

24

are entitled to absolute immunity.

25

So this is yet another reason why if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

the other side were correct and if Congress had

2

wanted to lay down the rule they did, why would

3

they not have just used the absolute immunity

4

language in subsection (b) of subsection (d)

5

and that, indeed, was the original draft of

6

this act that was discarded.

So I could go on, but I'd rather save
the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN ELLIS FOR

THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS

CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
If I could, I'd just like to pick up

18

right where my -- my friend left off.

19

been a lot of discussion so far this morning on

20

the text of Section 288a.

21

Petitioners have the far better reading of that

22

phrase in isolation, but I think it really

23

settles the deal when you look at the entire

24

structure of the Act.

25

There's

We agree that the

The -- the IOIA doesn't just grant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

immunity in Section 288a(b), but it provides a

2

whole host of immunities and it does it in two

3

different ways.

4

provisions, the Act sets a fixed rule of

5

immunity.

6

officers and employees of the organizations are

7

immune from suit with respect to their official

8

acts.

9

In several different

So archives are inviolable and

And then there are a -- a host, a

10

collection of three provisions that set the

11

immunity by reference to foreign governments.

12

There's Section 288a(d), Section 288d(a), and

13

there's Section 288a(b), the one at issue here.

14

Respondents concede that the

15

referential language in those other two

16

provisions do refer to the state of the law as

17

it is today.

18

It's only the one that's at issue in

19

this case that they say was frozen.

20

see how that can be, and that's particularly

21

true when you look at the drafting history that

22

my friend referred to.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We don't

Mr. Ellis, before you

24

get to that, another part of the structure is

25

this provision that deals with presidential

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

authority, and that's essentially a roll-back

2

authority of immunity.

3

Doesn't that make a lot more sense,

4

that provision, if you assume that Congress

5

meant for there to be absolute immunity?

6

other words, the presidential authority is a

7

one-way ratchet.

8

this provision roll it back.

9

it.

10

In

The President can only under
It can't increase

So, to me, if I -- if -- if -- if -­

11

if the immunity -- if the immunity is less than

12

absolute, you would think that they would have

13

given the presidential authority both ways.

14

MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

The reason that

15

argument doesn't work is because Section 288,

16

the President's authority under that provision,

17

doesn't just apply to Section 288a(b).

18

applies to all of the immunities provided by

19

the IOIA.

20

It

And as I was just describing, some of

21

those are fixed immunity rules that are not

22

absolute.

23

and employees of international organizations do

24

not receive diplomatic immunity.

25

big deal at the time.

And so, for instance, the officers

That was a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

And -- and yet the President can't -­

2

couldn't grant that up.

3

provision shows is that Congress wanted to

4

provide international organizations at most the

5

immunity from suit and other privileges of

6

immunities that foreign governments received

7

and not more so.

8
9

And yet Respondents are here today
asking you for exactly that, more immunity -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. ELLIS:

12

I think what that

But on that -­

-- than foreign

governments receive.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But look, whatever

14

other things it refers to, the provision allows

15

the President to waive immunity, not to grant

16

immunity.

And your argument is they have

17

immunity.

Right?

18
19

Do I have -- I get this backwards.
This is the third time I've got it backwards.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorry.

22

allows the person to be sued.

23

MR. ELLIS:

24
25

The provision

Is that right?

It does allow them to be

sued.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So I was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

right.

2

not the second, not the third.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

I had it backwards the first time but

MR. ELLIS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.
Okay.

It doesn't

allow him to grant the immunity.

9
10

It allows

the President to waive the immunity.

6

8

All right.

MR. ELLIS:

It does in a sense.

I

mean -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the power to

12

waive the immunity, at least in this section,

13

amounts to nothing if they have no immunity

14

because, for example, all they do is lend

15

money.

16

MR. ELLIS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

So -- so a couple -­

and the other way, it seems to work itself out.

19

MR. ELLIS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. ELLIS:

22

25

Understood.
Okay.

A couple responses to

that, Your Honor.

23
24

That's -- that's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the question,

I think.
MR. ELLIS:

Glad to be able to address

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

that.

Number -- number one, just to be clear,

2

we -- they do have a great deal of immunity.

3

mean, foreign -- international organizations

4

and foreign states are presumptively immune.

5

And I would agree with almost everything

6

that -- maybe everything that -- that my friend

7

said about why the commercial activity

8

exception, even with regard to IFC and -- and

9

most -- more importantly, with regard to the

I

10

vast sweep of these organizations, is not going

11

to eliminate immunity.

12

I would add one more, is that even a

13

case like this, we have serious doubts, I

14

think -- we think, in fact, from what we know,

15

this suit isn't going to be able to go forward

16

regardless of the answer to the question

17

presented, because in addition to having -- to

18

being connected in some way to commercial

19

activity, there must be a much stronger nexus.

20

It must be based on commercial activity that

21

occurs in the United States.

22

We think the Court's decision in OBB

23

makes clear that the way you apply that is to

24

ask:

25

not enough to have some attenuated connection,

What's the gravamen of this suit?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

but what's the gravamen?

2

And the gravamen of this suit as we

3

understand it is -- is tortious conduct that

4

occurred in India, injuries that occurred in

5

India.

6

doubts that this is going to be able to go

7

forward even under restrictive immunity.

8
9

And we don't think -- we have serious

And so we do not think that what we're
doing is opening the floodgates here; rather,

10

that the sort of concerns that would be barred

11

-- cases that would be barred by Respondent's

12

absolute rule of immunity and would be allowed

13

by ours are -- are sort of quintessential

14

domestic disputes, contract disputes with your

15

contractor who renovated the building, the slip

16

and fall at the -- at the organization's

17

headquarters, or the driving accident on the

18

streets of New York and D.C.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have -- do

20

you have any idea about how many of these kinds

21

of organizations are headquartered in the

22

United States?

23

MR. ELLIS:

I think the numbers are in

24

the 20 to 30 range.

There's about -- somewhere

25

80-some organizations that have been designated

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

for protection under IOIA and 20-some that have

MR. ELLIS:

-- there are a number of

development banks, but even then, even -- even

17

the development banks, even if you talk about

18

the World Bank, it's not clear that those

19

commercial activities are the sorts that the -­

the FSIA captures with the commercial activity

exception.

22

governments.

23

Lending there is to sovereign

And -- and as the Court has been -- as

24

lower courts have explained, that sort of

25

commercial activity is not the sort that a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

private party could engage in.

So it's not the

2

sort that the commercial activity exception

3

picks up.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -­
-- I've got -- that's

only half of them.
MR. ELLIS:

That -- that's -- that -­

14

I'm not sure what percentage that is.

15

to point out that some of those

16

organizations -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. ELLIS:

I want

There are a lot.

-- have their own immunity

19

provision in the -- in their charter.

20

that's what we think -- if you look at the

21

history, that's what -- that's how it has been

22

dealt with.

23

absolute immunity, we've entered into

24

agreements.

25

And so

For organizations that require

I would point again to the OAS

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

agreement, where the State Department is just

2

crystal-clear that what OAS did in that

3

agreement was to negotiate absolute immunity

because they thought that's what they needed in

5

order to put their headquarters here.

practice.

10

But Mister -­

We agreed to that and we

But, hey, this is not our usual
Ordinarily, we -- we afford only

restrictive immunity.

11

We point to the FSIA.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Ellis, I -- I

12

guess I'm not sure I -- I quite understood what

13

you meant.

14

of these multinational development banks, in

15

other words, making loans where private actors

16

would not make loans, do you have a view as to

17

whether that counts as a commercial activity or

18

not?

19

As to the core lending activities

Did you say that that would not count

20

as a commercial activity because they're making

21

loans that the -- that the private market would

22

not make?

23

MR. ELLIS:

No.

I'm -- I'm not saying

24

that it's -- that it's enough that they're

25

making loans that a -- that a private -- they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

couldn't find a private party to provide.

2

saying if the nature of the loan is such that

3

it's -- it's not the sort of transaction that a

4

private party would enter into, so think about

5

the IMF that grants -- that lends to sovereigns

6

and they do so on the requirement that the

7

sovereign enact certain restrictions -­

8

regulations and change their -- their -- their

9

laws in order to assure that they don't need

10

I'm

the money again.

11

That is the sort of thing that's been

12

held by lower courts, and we've advocated, is

13

not a commercial activity.

14

sort of transaction that a private party can

15

enter -- enter into.

16

private party didn't.

17

-- that's not something that you can do.

18

That's a sovereign act.

19
20

That's just not the

It's not just that a
It's that -- that no one

JUSTICE BREYER:

But can you give

me -­

21

MR. ELLIS:

Or a quasi-sovereign act.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- anything to assure

23

me?

Because when I looked through this list, I

24

thought that there were development banks like

25

the World Bank, which is a pretty big deal, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

well as in Asia, in Africa, we're trying to

2

encourage development all over the world, and

3

suddenly by removing the sovereign immunity

4

because the plaintiff will claim this is a

5

commercial activity.

6

MR. ELLIS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9
10

So -- so -­
And you're not

denying it.
MR. ELLIS:

And so -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is the

11

assurance that the government can give us that

12

this isn't going to lead to a lot of lawsuits

13

and this isn't going to interfere with perhaps

14

activity that the United States traditionally

15

has been very much in favor of?

16

MR. ELLIS:

17

me give you a couple things.

18

given you a number of -- of points already this

19

morning as to why we don't think the floodgates

20

are going to open.

21

Absolutely.

Let me -- let

I think we've

If -- if there's one more, I'll say

22

just look at the -- the charter of these

23

organizations.

24

They already waive suit, waive immunity for

25

suits going directly to their core activities.

Look at the IFC's charter.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

They -- they, in fact, indicate that they -­

2

they need to waive suit in these suits.

3

And so I -- I think when you're

4

talking about what are the suits that are going

5

to come up under commercial activity, many of

6

them are already going forward because the IFC

7

and the World Bank and others have waived their

8

immunity.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they need to

because?
MR. ELLIS:

They need to because no

12

one's going to enter into a financial

13

transaction with them if they -- they know they

14

can't sue if it -- if it goes south.

15

The other thing -- I want to also

16

focus the Court on the -- on the suits that we

17

know are not going to go forward on the

18

absolute immunity side.

19

suits by -- by U.S. citizens and residents

20

about domestic conduct and they're seeking

21

redress in U.S. courts.

22

We're talking about

These are the suits that foreign

23

governments are -- are able to be sued on and

24

don't have immunity.

25

reason why international organizations should

And we don't see any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

not also be subject to suit in those

2

circumstances, and we think that's exactly what

3

the Congress was trying to do when it enacted

4

Section 288 in 1945.

5
6

If there are no -- no further
questions, we ask the Court to reverse.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

14

The IOIA prescribes a standard of

15

virtual absolute immunity that is fixed and not

16

evolving.

17

incorporated common law terms that had a

18

settled meaning of virtually absolute immunity

19

and because a fixed standard makes the most

20

sense in light of the statutory context and

21

purpose.

22

We know that because the text

Now the reason that Congress enacted

23

the IOIA was to fulfill treaty obligations that

24

committed us to provide virtually absolute

25

immunity.

Those treaty obligations did not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

commit us to treat international organizations

2

the same as foreign states were treated.

3

committed us to the substantive standard of

4

virtually absolute immunity.

5

They

And, therefore, if -- if -- if the

6

language in Section 288b is interpreted in the

7

way my friends on the other side suggest -­

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn't

Congress say that the way it did in the other

10

provisions of this Act?

11

that in no change, it could have said it and

12

given the very exception it gave, which is that

13

the President or the executive could reduce

14

immunity, which was the standard at the time.

15

MR. VERRILLI:

And if it intended

So let me start with

16

the basic question.

17

applies the normal rules of construction that

18

it applies in statutory interpretation cases,

19

that Congress did say that it was providing

20

virtually absolute immunity.

21

We think if the Court

And I think a case in particular that

22

I would point the Court to is the Neder

23

decision, 527 U.S., and in particular to page

24

21 of the Neder decision.

25

that case, of course, was about whether mail

That's a case -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

35

fraud and wire fraud incorporated a materiality

2

standard.

3

Rehnquist, unanimous for the Court on this

4

point.

5

text, of course, and when looking to the text,

6

if we -- if -- and in looking to the text,

7

based solely on a natural reading of the full

8

text, materiality wouldn't be an element of the

9

fraud statute.

10

This is an opinion by Chief Justice

The Court said first we look to the

And then the Court says:

But that

11

does not end the inquiry because, in

12

interpreting statutory language, there's a

13

necessary second step.

14

coming to the point that I think governs here,

15

which is that it is a well-established rule of

16

construction, a rule of construction, that

17

where Congress uses terms that have accumulated

18

settled meaning under the common law, a court

19

must infer, must infer, unless the statute

20

dictates otherwise, that Congress means to

21

incorporate the established meaning of those

22

terms.

23

And this is -- I'm

Now the -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

24

argument that there wasn't an established

25

meaning in -- what was it -- 1945, that it -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

the -- the status of the immunity was in flux?

2

It had been absolute, but then we were going

3

over -- the State Department was advising the

4

court whether immunity should be given in a

5

particular case.

6

MR. VERRILLI:

There's a bit of a

7

suggestion to that effect in the brief of the

8

United States, Your Honor, but I would

9

respectfully suggest that is not a fair

10

characterization of where things stood in 1945

11

at all.

12

It is true that some people within the

13

State Department in 1945 thought that immunity

14

should move to a more restrictive standard, but

15

the Justice Department would not even advance

16

that standard in this Court, at the request of

17

the State Department, and this Court did not

18

describe the immunity as being in flux.

19

Court said the standard was virtually absolute

20

immunity.

This

21

If one looks even in 1952 at the Tate

22

Letter, the Tate Letter didn't say the law was

23

in flux in the United States.

24

United States was hewing to the standard of

25

virtually absolute immunity, but other

It said the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

countries were moving towards a standard of

2

restrictive immunity and, therefore, we ought

3

to reconsider what we're doing.

4

So I just -- I mean, the Court can

5

read these materials for -- for itself, but I

6

just respectfully do not think it's a fair

7

consideration of where things stood in 1945 at

8

all.

9

And then, if I could, I'd like to pick

10

up on a related point that came up in the brief

11

of the United States.

12

in the brief of the United States, and it came

13

up in argument today that, look, this really

14

isn't a problem because for those organizations

15

that need immunity that goes beyond the -- the

16

restrictive immunity, we've always understood

17

that they get -- they can go get a special

18

statute and they've gone and gotten special

19

statutes.

20

It's another statement

The United States says on page 27 of

21

its brief, precisely because the IOIA didn't

22

provide that level of immunity, they give these

23

three examples:

24

and Organization of American States.

25

IMF, World Trade Organization,

I'd like to take a minute and go

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

through each of them because it doesn't hold up

2

with respect to each of them.

3

the IMF, for example, it is true the IMF, you

4

know, it has a -- has a treaty.

5

statute that gave that treaty effect under U.S.

6

law, which ended up providing for absolute

7

immunity.

8
9

With respect to

There was a

But it can't possibly be that that was
undertaken based on any sense that the IOIA

10

didn't provide that level of immunity because

11

the IMF statute was enacted in July of 1945,

12

and the IOIA wasn't enacted until five months

13

later.

14

the government was saying.

15

So it can't possibly substantiate what

If one looks at the WTO treaty, it is

16

true with respect to that treaty that it

17

committed us to a very wide scope of

18

immunities.

19

the United States will commit to providing all

20

or virtually all of the immunities provided

21

under a whole different U.N. convention, the

22

U.N. convention on specialized agencies.

23

It said that the United -- that

Now that convention has all kinds of

24

tax immunities and property immunities that go

25

way beyond what the IOIA provides.

So, of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

course, they needed another statute in order to

2

make those treaty commitments.

3

prove anything about whether anybody thought

4

that the IOIA failed to provide virtually

5

absolute immunity.

6

That doesn't

In fact, the historical evidence, I

7

think, really, to the extent it points in any

8

direction, it points very much more in our

9

direction.

And the best way to see that is

10

with respect to the way the United Nations was

11

treated under -- by the executive branch in

12

this country.

13

Now we signed the U.N. charter in

14

1945, committed us to provide what the charter

15

describes as the necessary immunities.

16

the U.N. Convention on Immunities was

17

negotiated in 1946, which said that the U.N.

18

should get virtually absolute immunity.

19

the same immunity as foreign states, virtually

20

absolute immunity.

21

Then

Not

Now the United States did not ratify

22

that convention until 1970.

So, on the theory

23

that my friends on the other side have, from

24

the moment of the Tate Letter in 1952 when

25

foreign state immunity became restrictive and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not virtually absolute anymore, we were in

2

violation of the commitment we made in the U.N.

3

charter.

4

Now, if that was true, you would

certainly expect the State Department, A, to

address it in the Tate Letter, but there's

nothing in there.

them to try to do something about it, like get

It's a classic case of the
And, B, you would expect

10

the U.N. convention ratified immediately,

11

because, otherwise, we were going to be out of

12

-- out of compliance with our obligations to

13

the granddaddy of all international

14

organizations, the United Nations.

15

But there's not a -- from 1952 until

16

the ratification of the convention in 1970, you

17

can't find one word by anybody in the executive

18

branch ever saying that.

What you do find -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What commercial

activities was the U.N. doing at that time?

21

MR. VERRILLI:

Well -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know today it's

23

a very different organization, but it's not

24

clear to me that there was much going on that

25

was commercial at its initial stages.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

MR. VERRILLI:

I take that point, Your

2

Honor, but what I would say in response is that

3

there was a very great deal of sensitivity

4

about the whole package of -- of immunities

5

that were available to the U.N. and its

6

diplomats and its -- and its workers.

7

And there was concern all along from

8

1952 to 1970 that -- that -- where the

9

executive was urging Congress to ratify the

10

convention, but the only things ever mentioned

11

were the diplomats -- immunities for diplomatic

12

individuals.

13

And then, when you get to 1970 and you

14

actually look at the Senate report accompanying

15

the ratification, this was not in our brief,

16

but it's at page 31 of the brief of the -- of

17

the scholars who filed the brief in support of

18

us.

19

what the Senate report says is we're not

20

granting the U.N. any -- the U.N. as an

21

organization any immunity it didn't already

22

have under the IOIA.

23

It quotes the Senate report from 1970, and

So, as late as 1970, it was just quite

24

clear that everybody understood the IOIA

25

conferred virtually absolute immunity.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And, of

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

course, that's because it was -- it was enacted

2

to comply with our treaty obligations.

3

It wasn't enacted to make sure that,

4

come what may, that international organizations

5

would get treated the same as foreign states.

6

That is -- you know, that's the best way to

7

think about it, is it's just a completely

8

anachronistic way of thinking about the body of

9

materials in front of you.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But even what you just

11

said, Mr. Verrilli, it wasn't enacted to make

12

sure that foreign organizations would get

13

treated the same as foreign states.

14
15
16

I mean, that's exactly what the
language of the thing says.
MR. VERRILLI:

Well, so I guess a

17

couple of things about that.

18

way to think about the language, Justice Kagan,

19

is that it was a means to an end in 1945 when

20

it was enacted.

21

I think the right

It was not the end in itself to assure

22

equivalence of treatment come what may.

23

the means by which Congress ensured that it

24

would fulfill its treaty commitments which were

25

-- and those treaty commitments were to provide

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It was

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

virtually absolute immunity.

2

And we know, the Senate report says

3

we're enacting this provision to fulfill our

4

treaty commitments.

5

commitments, again, were not to treat them the

6

same.

7

immunity.

They were to provide virtually absolute

And our treaty

So -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think it was -­

you answered Justice Ginsburg's questions about

10

how far we were from the Tate Letter in 1945,

11

but do you think it was inconceivable to

12

Congress that the common law of immunity would

13

change?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I -- I -- I can't

15

say that it would be inconceivable to anybody,

16

but what I can say is if one looks at the

17

debates surrounding the passage of the IOIA,

18

is, once again, it's a dog that didn't bark.

19

You can't find a single person

20

anywhere saying anything remotely like the

21

proposition that we need to adopt a standard

22

that will evolve over time because we have a

23

concern that foreign sovereign immunity law

24

will evolve over time.

25

That just was not any part of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44

anybody's thinking at that time.

trying -- you have to remember this is coming

out of the Bretten Woods system.

7

mission in front of them to try to rebuild the

8

world -- the world after the carnage of World

9

War II.

There's a lot of pressure on Congress

10

to get these organizations up and going and

11

give them the immunity we promised them so they

12

can go out and do their work.

13

to the enactment of the IOIA.

14

That's what led

It was none of these other things, as

15

I said.

I really think if you look at the

16

historical materials, it's the -- the gloss

17

that my friends on the other side are trying to

18

put on it is completely anachronistic.

19

taking a different concept that they've come up

20

with now and trying to retrofit the historical

21

facts to match it, and it just isn't right.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're

Is that -- is that -­

23

the Russians at that time, '45 and so forth,

24

were putting all these businesses into state

25

entities.

So my guess is there were -- there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

were a number of cases, and what I thought I

2

heard Mr. Fisher say is, if we really go back

3

and look at this, we'll see that the status quo

4

before this passed was not absolute immunity,

5

but the status quo was a kind of mess, where

6

sometimes the State Department would say give

7

them immunity and sometimes the State

8

Department would say not.

9

Now what -- what is the actual

10

situation as far as you've been able to find

11

it?

12

MR. VERRILLI:

other side, I don't think that's a fair

characterization of the historical materials.

the answer you gave to me is the answer you

would give to Justice Breyer?

Letter describes it too.

process matter -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. VERRILLI:

And then, as a

Okay, I got it.
-- my friends on the

12

other side have made this argument that, well,

13

our position would also require you to go back

14

to the process of the State Department making

15

an ad hoc case-by-case determination, but

16

that's wrong too.

17

And that's clear on the face of the

18

statute that it's wrong.

19

-- and that's right in Section 288.

20

creates an entirely different mechanism.

21

And the reason -- and
This

What the -- what the IOIA says is that

22

-- that the President shall have the authority

23

under executive order, once Congress has

24

enacted a statute, to grant an international

25

organization the privileges and immunities.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

And if you look at the face of the

2

statute, it's obvious that they are granted on

3

a categorical basis in gross by an executive

4

order, not on a case-by-case basis by the State

5

Department when law -- when a lawsuit is -­

6

when a -- when a lawsuit is filed.

7

And then, similarly, in terms of the

8

President's authority as to an executive order

9

to reduce or eliminate the -- the immunity of

10

an international organization, that -- it's -­

11

again, it's completely different than the

12

situation that -- than the common law process

13

at work.

14

judgment that it was going to put a different

15

structure and system in place.

16

So, obviously, Congress made a

And the fact that Congress did that, I

17

do say -- I do think quite clearly presupposes

18

that there's a -- the existence of a

19

substantive standard being prescribed.

20

substantive standard, as I said, is virtually

21

absolute immunity.

22

And the

And then, in terms of the structural

23

indicators in the statutory text, going back to

24

a question you asked, Justice Sotomayor, I

25

really think the most telling one, to -- to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

show you I think why my friends on the other

2

side's case is completely anachronistic and

3

we're correct -- is Section 288f, which you can

4

find at page 6a of the appendix to the blue

5

brief.

6

That provision says that the

7

privileges, exemptions, and immunities of

8

international organizations and then of -- of

9

members and employees, et cetera, shall be

10

granted notwithstanding the fact that similar

11

privileges, exemptions, and immunities granted

12

to a foreign government, et cetera, et cetera,

13

may be conditioned upon the existence of

14

reciprocity by that foreign government.

15

So right there in the text it

16

decouples the treatment of international

17

organizations from the treatment of foreign

18

states.

19

United States would not grant the full range of

20

virtually absolute immunity because it wasn't

21

being -- receiving reciprocal treatment, this

22

statute says the international organization

23

gets it.

24
25

Even in a situation in which the

So -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you deal

with the argument that we just heard, that we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

can compare 288a on the one hand, which -­

2

which keeps the international organizations in

3

tune with foreign sovereigns, and 288 -- was it

4

b and d?

5

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

I do think that

6

the -- the differences break down into two

7

categories, Your Honor.

8

provisions do prescribe fixed standards.

9

That's true.

There -- some of the

But those fixed standards, as we

10

explained in our brief or at least tried to,

11

are always situations in which the IOIA is

12

conferring a narrower set of immunities on -­

13

on diplomats and individuals than the common

14

law would have at the time.

15

So incorporation of the standard in

16

the way this 288a(b) did wouldn't accomplish

17

the objective there because there was -- they

18

were quite consciously trying to narrow the

19

overall scope of immunities and not give the

20

individuals who worked at these organizations

21

the same full treatment that diplomats got who

22

-- from foreign states.

23

Now the second subcategory are the

24

provisions where the -- the statute says that

25

their -- the treatment shall be the same.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

there's two things about that that are

2

significant.

3

One is it says they shall be the same

4

as under another statutory provision.

5

we said, we think that's vitally important

6

here.

7

addition to Justice Breyer's points about the

8

reference canon, that the reference canon

9

applies when one statute incorporates another.

10

It doesn't apply when one statute incorporates

11

the common law.

12

incorporating statutes.

13

And as

We think it's quite clear that, in

And, here, they were

And if you look at those provisions

14

anyway, they're basically just instructions to

15

the executive branch, when do you fingerprint

16

the people when they're coming in?

17

do about that -- this detail or that detail?

18

What do you

They don't go to the heart of the

19

matter at all.

20

here is the immunity being conferred on these

21

international organizations.

22

And the heart of the matter

I just want to make a point about that

23

and then, if I could, talk about the

24

consequences that will ensue, I think, if we go

25

down the path that my friends on the other side

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

are suggesting.

2

I think this is a critical point.

I

3

just want to make sure it's clear.

4

reason why you shouldn't draw this equivalence

5

-- and it can't be that Congress really

6

intended to draw the equivalence between

7

foreign states and international organizations

8

such that they would just move in tandem no

9

matter what -- is that immunity is granted for

10

Another

different reasons.

11

The reason you give an international

12

organization immunity is a functional reason,

13

not a status reason.

14

the appropriate respect to the sovereigns,

15

because international organizations aren't

16

sovereigns.

17

persons.

It's not about according

They're separate juridical

18

And what's quite clear -- it's clear

19

from the U -- the San Francisco report on the

20

foundation of the U.N., it's clear from the

21

Senate report in 1945, it's clear from all the

22

commentators that we discussed in our brief,

23

it's clear from the Restatement of Foreign

24

Relations, which we've cited in our brief, that

25

you grant immunity to international

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

organizations so that they can carry out their

2

functions effectively.

3

let me take a minute and kind of elaborate on

4

that because I think it's critical.

And -- and just take -­

5

Remember, these are -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you don't

7

mind, I'm afraid I'm about five minutes behind

8

you here, but going -- going back to your point

9

on 288f, you said it's there they're decoupling

10

the international organizations and the foreign

11

sovereigns.

12

it's simply because the -- the foreign

13

sovereigns have the capability to use

14

reciprocity, and the foreign -- and the

15

multi-country organizations do not.

But, as I go back and read it,

16

I don't -- I mean, that's the

17

difference they're drawing there, not something

18

between the scope of the actual immunities.

19

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I -- well, the

20

way I read it, Mr. Chief Justice, is what -­

21

what they're doing there is saying even in a

22

situation in which the United States concludes

23

that it won't afford a foreign sovereign the

24

full virtually absolute immunity because of

25

reciprocity -- in other words, we're not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

getting it back from them -- even in that

2

situation, an international organization of -­

3

where those sovereigns are members will still

4

receive the full level of immunity.

5

And so I think what that tells us is

6

that what Congress was trying to do in this

7

statute overall was prescribe a fixed

8

substantive standard, not a floating standard

9

where the two things move in tandem.

10
11

So -- and

I -- I do think it supports that.
And if I could just go back to the

12

functional point, remember, these are

13

collective bodies and members come together,

14

they make -- they -- they take resources from

15

each of their own countries.

16

into these organizations.

17

decisions about how to deploy those resources.

18

And the point of the immunity here is

They put them

They make collective

19

so that the courts of any country, but

20

especially the host country, which for the most

21

important organizations are going to be here in

22

the United States, can't override the

23

collective judgments that they make about how

24

their resources would be deployed and what

25

conditions they ought to impose, et cetera, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

the intervention of domestic law in U.S. courts

2

and can't redirect the funds that are put into

3

these organizations to pay massive class action

4

tort judgments because, of course, the member

5

countries are contributing this money because

6

they believe it's going to be put to the use

7

that the -- for example, the development bank,

8

the development bank decides it should be put

9

to, not to pay massive tort judgments.

10

And I think one place you see this

11

very clearly, if you look at the report of the

12

San Francisco conference about the founding of

13

the U.N., the State Department's -­

14

Department's response coming -- report coming

15

out of that conference, specifically says this.

16

It says, of course, the United Nations can't be

17

subject to the jurisdiction of any one state or

18

its courts.

19

And it's for exactly this reason.

And

20

the same thing is true generally.

21

you give it, not for functional reasons -- I

22

mean, excuse me, not for reasons of status but

23

for functional reasons.

24
25

That's why

And I think a key -- another key
reason why you shouldn't be thinking about this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

as a standard that evolves, evolves now and

2

over time, is that those functional reasons

3

don't evolve now and over time.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what

5

about the point that most of the concerns you

6

have are going to be dealt with by the

7

requirement of a nexus to activity in the

8

United States as opposed to simply abroad,

9

where the projects are funded?

10

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

I was gratified

11

to hear the United States say that, but -- and

12

-- but I could just -- I'll answer Your Honor's

13

question directly, but I want to broaden it out

14

a little bit because I think what essentially

15

the United States is saying here is, look, the

16

statute leaves one with no choice but to apply

17

restrictive principles of immunity.

18

to jump off that cliff, but don't worry, it

19

will be a soft landing because the FSIA will

20

take care of a lot of these problems.

21

You've got

And I guess what I would say about

22

that is, in the unlikely event you don't agree

23

with me, I -­

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. VERRILLI:

that's a big part of the problem and -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

negligence in determining, in a different

under which the money would be spent?

an American lawsuit, saying what you've done

here is commit the act of negligence or failure

16

to be a fiduciary here?

17

MR. VERRILLI:

That's this lawsuit.

18

That's this lawsuit, Justice Breyer.

19

exactly what they're alleging.

20

Is that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's

Well, but, I

21

mean, is that consistent with our opinion in

22

the OBB case, which I think -- if the complaint

23

is based, the gravamen of the complaint, not

24

specific steps along the way, and that was the

25

issue we dealt with in that case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

And I appreciate the fact that it's,

2

you know, to some extent dependent on the facts

3

and particular allegations, but it would seem

4

to me to require a lot more than simply the

5

specific decisions.

6

the gravamen, or gravamen, however you say it,

7

with what's going on here?

I think where -- where's

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, we would

certainly say it's India, of course.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. VERRILLI:

Yeah.

And if -- if we have to

12

defend ourselves on that basis, we will.

13

-- but I -- I think it -- it understates the

14

real concrete risk here.

15

do to illustrate that, if I could, is first

16

talk about the organizations that are going to

17

be exposed in a way that they wouldn't be under

18

the law.

19

But I

And what I'd like to

And as Justice Breyer indicated

20

earlier, it's important to remember this has

21

been the law in the D.C. Circuit for decades,

22

and there's -- and people have ordered their

23

affairs based on the assumption that there was

24

virtually absolute immunity.

25

But with respect -- but with respect

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

to the consequences and the groups affected and

2

then the types of effects.

3

groups affected, you've got entities like us,

the multilateral development banks, and Justice

Breyer's identified many of them.

With respect to the

here in Washington, D.C., and they're making

their decisions here and, I think critically

too, there are billions of dollars of assets

Now we're going to make the OBB

argument for sure, and I hope we win if we have

13

to make the argument.

Committee of the Red Cross, the World Health

Organization, the fund to fight -- the global

4

fund to fight AIDS and tuberculosis and

5

malaria.

6

the IOIA for their immunities, and those

7

immunities are drastically different after

They are all entirely dependent on

And then we do have the issue, I

10

think, with some organizations that we may even

11

actually now be out of our -- out of compliance

12

with our treaty commitments.

13

Now what's going to happen?

Here's

14

what I think is going to happen, and I think

15

this lawsuit helps you see it.

16

Now the way -- the basis of this

17

lawsuit is the following:

18

money here, it's loaning money in -- in parts

19

of the world where private capital won't go

20

unless we go in there.

21

have un-developed legal systems and they

22

certainly don't have robust environmental

23

protections or labor protections.

24
25

IFC, when it loans

And very often they

So what the IFC has done is lien into
those, has put those kinds of environmental

standards and labor standards into its

2

agreements, saying you want this money to do

3

this development project, these are the

4

standards that you've got to live up to.

5

And -- and this lawsuit is that -­

6

that the entity that we loan this money to

7

didn't live up to the standards and it's our

8

fault, and so we're being sued here.

9

Well, it's going to create -- if that

10

kind of a suit can go forward, and hopefully it

11

won't be able to, Mr. Chief Justice, but if it

12

can, it's certainly going to create an

13

extraordinary disincentive for organizations

14

like ours to lien into those kinds of standards

15

because we're going to be hoisted by our own

16

petard.

17

Now we've also got a robust internal

18

accountability mechanism where, if people think

19

something's gone wrong on one of our projects,

20

they can come to us and they can say -- they

21

can say, look, there's a problem here.

22

they -- and we investigate.

23

remedial measures if we find there's a problem.

24
25

And

We take internal

Well, you know, the factual basis for
the lawsuit is the report of our internal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

accountability process.

2

So, if they can just grab that and

3

take it into court and make it the basis for a

4

class action tort lawsuit in which they can

5

make a claim for all this money, it's going to

6

create a powerful disincentive for us not to

7

engage in that kind of self-policing activity.

8
9

And I would submit that, you know,
even if things ultimately work themselves out

10

under the FSIA, and I hope they -- I hope we

11

don't have to deal with that, but even if we

12

do, it's going to take a very long time.

13

are going to be a lot of difficult cases at the

14

margin.

15

disincentives immediately.

There are going to be very serious

24

actually injured them, the power plant in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I really think what you're going

2

to see here is that this is just going to

3

become another version of the sorts of

4

foreign-cubed lawsuits that the Court has been

5

concerned about under the Alien Tort Statute

6

where the international organization is just

7

going to be subbed in for the foreign defendant

8

and it's going to be subbed in in a situation

9

where we're going to have a very significant

10

pile of money.

11

And if I could just close with this

12

thought -- I'm just going to pick up on Justice

13

Breyer's thought -- the law in the District of

14

Columbia, where virtually all these

15

organizations have been housed, are

16

headquartered, has been virtually absent

17

immunity under D.C. Circuit law for decades.

18

That's the standard everybody's been operating

19

under.

20

Nobody's suggested that anything has

21

gone wrong under this statute, that there are

22

any deleterious policy consequences, that the

23

interests of the United States are adversely

24

affected in any way.

25

the amicus brief from the former Secretaries of

effectively with these organizations.

Four minutes, Mr. Fisher.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I'd like to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

make four points and I'd like to start with the

2

text of the statute itself and simply say when

3

Mr. Verrilli talks about the Neder Doctrine and

4

the Common Law Doctrine, that you look at the

5

term -- a term's meaning at the time of

6

enactment, he's mixing apples and oranges.

7

And I think all the citations in our

8

reply brief should make it absolutely clear

9

that there's a doctrine on the one hand that

10

talks about incorporating a body of law, and

11

there's a doctrine on the other hand about

12

giving meaning to a specific term.

13

the former camp here.

14

We're in

And as to the point about whether the

15

common law was evolving at the time, two

16

things.

17

fact that it was somewhat in flux.

18

We'll stand on the papers as to the

But the more important point is, even

19

if it weren't in flux, it wouldn't matter one

20

wit, because the other side is making a

21

sweeping proposition, which is any general

22

reference to common law is fixed in time.

23

That would disrupt any number of

24

federal statutory regimes, from the Federal

25

Tort Claims Act, enacted the year after this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

statute, the Equal Access to Justice Act, the

2

federal government's piracy statute, Federal

3

Rule of Evidence 501.

4

with federal statutory regimes that reference

5

the common law in exactly the same way the

6

statute does here.

7

I could go on and on

The Civil Rights Act of 1866, if you

8

want one more.

All of those would come out the

9

other way from this Court's jurisprudence and

10

from all the understanding if the other side is

11

right about statutory interpretation.

12

So I think the only thing the other

13

side has is they have a bunch of policy points

14

to make for this Court.

15

Now we don't think they should

16

control, but let me answer them.

17

to our treaty obligations.

18

moment of enactment.

19

that there were various agreements in place

20

that required virtually absolute immunity.

21

So first as

So one about at the

My friend kept saying

None of the agreements use those

22

words.

Instead, what those agreements said is

23

that certain organizations were entitled to

24

immunity to allow them to perform their

25

necessary functions.

That's a very different

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

thing than absolute immunity.

2

And it's very different because none

3

of the organizations involved were performing,

4

Justice Sotomayor, commercial activities that

5

were essential to their core functions, not the

6

U.N., not any of the other organizations.

7

So we weren't in breach of any treaty

8

rights.

And if you have any doubt on that, I

9

would urge you to look to the federal

10

government's position then and now.

11

just a brief filed in this Court.

12

It's not

It is the position that four different

13

Presidential Administrations have taken.

14

Carter Administration, right after the FSIA was

15

passed, the George H. W. Bush Administration,

16

the Clinton Administration, and now the Trump

17

Administration, have all consistently held that

18

the FSIA rules are incorporated into the FSIA.

19

The

Next, on the floodgates concern.

I

20

explained earlier and I hope you will think

21

about the fact that, while the core activities

22

of the IFC might be commercial activity, not

23

all of the IFC's activities are, and certainly

24

not all the activities of international

25

organizations are.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

But let me add one more thing.

My -­

2

my friend talked about big lawsuits of ruinous

3

liability.

4

control that.

5

Well, there's two very easy ways to

One is, to the extent any claims are

6

on contracts, they can write their own

7

contracts and negotiate their own contracts.

8

As the Solicitor General points out, they can

9

even deal with third-party beneficiaries in

10

their contracts if they choose.

11

Secondly, as to tort claims, they can

12

and, in fact, commonly do indemnify themselves

13

against tort lawsuits.

14

their agreement indemnifies them against any

15

judgment and all legal fees.

16

In this very case,

So these organizations have every

17

manner of method to deal with any potential

18

liability.

19

of belies the suggestion that they think

20

they're absolutely immune from lawsuit.

21

And, in fact, they are, which sort

Finally, let me say one thing about

22

the so-called foreign cubed problem or the

23

facts of this case.

24

that we would satisfy the gravamen test.

25

have never made that argument.

Now, obviously, we think
They

And if they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

want to make it, we can -- we can have that

2

conversation in the lower courts.

3

But bear in mind what you're being

4

asked to do in this case is to announce a

5

categorical rule for all cases dealing with

6

international organizations.

7

So my friend in the Solicitor

8

General's Office talked about just regular tort

9

slip and fall cases and the like in the United

10

States.

11

think about.

12

Let me give you one other thing to

Some international organizations

13

actually do their work in the United States.

14

The border cooperation -- the Border

15

Environmental Cooperation Commission does

16

wastewater treatment plants in Texas and

17

California.

18

I can't think of any reason why they

19

would be immune from those infrastructure

20

projects in a way that no private business or

21

public government would be.
