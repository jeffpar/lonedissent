Mr. Frank.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE H. FRANK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. FRANK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

Amchem instructs that courts should

13

interpret Rule 23 with the interests of absent

14

class members in close view.

15

interpret Rule 23's text requiring settlements

16

be fair and reasonable is to align class

17

counsel's interests with those of the absent

18

class members.

The best way to

19

In Deposit Guaranty versus roper at

20

page 339, this Court called it an abuse when

21

class members were not the primary

22

beneficiaries of a class action.

23

fair and reasonable for a court to endorse such

24

an abuse?

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How can it be

Why is it an abuse?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Because, practically, the class members would

2

get nothing, nothing at all, and, here, at

3

least they get an indirect benefit.

4

MR. FRANK:

Well, the indirect benefit

5

is even less than nothing.

6

feasible to distribute money to class members.

7

And, instead, class counsel chose to agree to a

8

settlement that directed that money elsewhere.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- it was

How much would it

have come to for each class member?
MR. FRANK:

Each claiming class member

12

probably could have gotten between 5 and 10

13

dollars with typical claims rates if -- for

14

example, in the Fraley versus Facebook

15

settlement, the court rejected an all cy pres

16

settlement -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sorry.

There's an

18

amicus brief that talked -- who laid out pretty

19

thoroughly the costs associated with, first,

20

identifying the class; second, preparing the

21

mailing; third, executing the mailing; and then

22

processing the claims that came up with a

23

figure of 67 cents.

24
25

Now, putting aside that there may be a
question about whether the trial court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

adequately determined feasibility, but assuming

2

it did, why would it have been an abuse of

3

discretion for the court to believe that

4

processing 67 cents didn't make sense because

5

the cost would outweigh what they would pay?

6
7
8
9

MR. FRANK:

Well, the district court

applied the wrong legal standard, but -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no.

I know

your standard for feasibility -­

10

MR. FRANK:

Right, right.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- is can we give

12

10 percent of the class something even if

13

nobody else gets anything, meaning what you

14

would like to do is select 10 percent of the

15

class and pay them alone and do nothing for

16

everybody else.

17

MR. FRANK:

Well, no.

We would like

18

to give everybody in the class the opportunity

19

to make a claim.

20

minority of the class would not be indifferent

21

to the opportunity, and typically -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

And in practice, a very small

Everybody else

would receive not even an indirect benefit?

24

MR. FRANK:

No, they would receive the

25

opportunity to make a claim.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that opportunity.

MR. FRANK:

They don't have that

opportunity here as a class member.

5

members were deprived of that opportunity.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They could opt

out.

Class

MR. FRANK:

They could opt out in

Amchem also, but that didn't make the
settlement fair.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I go back to

12

my point, which is are you disputing the

13

finding of fact that under the normal

14

application of feasibility, whether cost

15

outweighs the payment or cost far exceeds

16

whatever could be given out, is that -- are you

17

disputing that?

18

MR. FRANK:

The court never made that

19

finding.

20

de minimis test under Lane versus Facebook,

21

which required it to divide by the entire

22

denominator the entire class.

23

The court applied the Ninth Circuit's

In reality, settlements settle all the

24

time for well under a dollar per class member

25

and then successfully distribute that money to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

the class because most class members are just

2

simply indifferent to the opportunity for these

3

small sums.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then is it all

5

right to have some kind of a cy pres doctrine

6

operate?

MR. FRANK:

The claims come in either

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That's what happened in Carrier IQ, where,

2

again, even though we were talking pennies per

3

class member, it only cost them $600,000 to

4

distribute a few million dollars to 30 million

5

class members and still audit the claims and

6

reject 30 percent of the claims.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­

I'm sorry, I -­

8

I'm talking -- this is a full cy pres award,

9

meaning there's no direct benefit to the class.

10

What about the residual cy pres?

11

many instances, if a fund is created and the

12

claimants are all paid off, there's some money

13

left over, the residual cy pres, and that's

14

given indirectly often.

15

MR. FRANK:

I thought in

Circuits differ on that.

16

The Seventh rejects that proposal because they

17

recognize that the settling parties have the

18

ability to adjust the claims rate by -­

19

depending on how difficult they make the claims

20

process.

21

So, in a Seventh Circuit case, there

22

is a $1.1 million residual and 12 million class

23

members, though that was 8 cents per class

24

member.

25

was a benefit to the class and said you've made

The court rejected the idea that that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

the claims process too hard and required them

2

to redo the settlement on remand.

3

more dollars went to the class because they

4

changed the -- the claims process and made it

5

easier for class members to make claims.

6

Millions

So, if you have a residual and you

7

incentivize the attorneys to prefer the

8

residual to the actual claims, what will happen

9

is you'll have a very difficult claims process.

10

There is a Third Circuit case, a $35 million

11

fund, and -- but you had to fill out a

12

five-page claim form to claim your $5.

13

very few class members did that.

14

only going to distribute $3 million with over

15

15 million to cy pres.

16

And so

They were

And the Third Circuit rejected that,

17

that the district court failed to prioritize

18

direct benefit to the class.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it just -­
Assuming all of

20

that, let's assume a very efficient claim

21

process, let's assume a -- a careful

22

feasibility study by the district court.

23

Are you still -- you're still taking

24

the position that if there's a residual for any

25

reason that's legitimate, there's been an easy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

claims process, there's been a simple

2

distribution, whatever, you're still saying

3

that an indirect benefit, a partial cy pres, is

4

not okay?

5

MR. FRANK:

6

reward class counsel for it.

7

incentivize them to prioritize the direct

8

benefit to the class.

9

I'm saying that you can't

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You have to

So your position

10

is that cy pres is okay, but we should write

11

legislation in our opinion saying that we can't

12

pay class counsel for that.

13

Have you read the Third Circuit

14

opinion that talks about this and says there's

15

a lot to balance in this issue, and are the

16

courts the appropriate one or is Congress the

17

appropriate one?

18

MR. FRANK:

Well -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or is the

20

individual district court's discretion

21

appropriate until the Congress looks at this

22

and decides?

23

MR. FRANK:

I think Rule 23(e) means

24

something.

And this Court has previously

25

called disproportionate benefits an abuse.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

it's -- it's very clear that Rule 23 -- not -­

2

not -- it's not the case that everything goes

3

under Rule 23(e), so long as a district court

4

rubber stamps it.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

In a case such as

6

this, is any effort made -- and would it even

7

be possible -- to determine whether every

8

absent class member or even most of the absent

9

class members regard the beneficiaries of the

10

cy pres award as entities to which they would

11

like to make a contribution?

12

MR. FRANK:

It's very possible to

13

establish a claims process where somebody

14

checks a box and said, instead of sending me a

15

check for $6, send it to the American Cancer

16

Society.

17

Nobody does that, or at least we -- we

18

haven't seen settlements that do that.

19

reality is, if class members want to send their

20

money to charity, they can do it without the

21

intermediary of class counsel.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the

So who decides who

these beneficiaries are going to be?
MR. FRANK:

It varies from settlement

In this case, class counsel and

2

beneficiaries.

3

don't understand which beneficiaries didn't

4

make the cut and why they didn't make the cut,

5

but they -- they chose these particular

6

beneficiaries.

7

That process was opaque, and we

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the parties and the

8

lawyers get together and they choose

9

beneficiaries that they personally would like

10

to subsidize?

11

That's how it works?

MR. FRANK:

That's usually how it

12

works.

13

where the judge says I don't like these

14

beneficiaries, pick these beneficiaries.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16
17

We've had -- I've seen settlements

Where the

judge has designated the beneficiaries?
MR. FRANK:

There are settlements

18

structured where the judge designates the

19

beneficiaries.

20

And in another Google settlement that

21

we discuss in our opening brief, the parties

22

designated a beneficiary and -- and the court

re-designated the beneficiary.

May I ask you, Mr.

Frank, to -- to -- to address the standing

issue in this case, to -- to talk about what

17

you think the harm was and whether any court

18

has addressed your theories about the harm?

19
20
21
22
23

MR. FRANK:

Are you -- are you talking

my harm or the harm of the plaintiffs?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

The harm of the

plaintiffs.
MR. FRANK:

The harm of the

24

plaintiffs, we discuss that at pages 25 and 26

25

of our reply brief.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

And one of the named plaintiffs,

2

Anthony Italiano, alleges a statutory violation

3

that corresponds to the common law tort of

4

public disclosure of private facts.

5

And the lower courts are unanimous in

6

holding that that kind of statutory claim

7

satisfies Spokeo.

8
9
10
11

Even on remand in Spokeo, the Ninth
Circuit found standing, and this Court denied
cert the second time up.
So I don't think there's a real

12

standing issue, unless the Court is inclined to

13

expand Spokeo.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I had thought, Mr.

15

Frank, that the lower court thought that there

16

would be -- there was standing just because it

17

was a statutory claim, and that there was no

18

reason that the plaintiff had to show a

19

particularized or a concrete injury.

20

MR. FRANK:

That is certainly the

21

wrong standard for the district court to have

22

applied, with later Supreme Court jurisprudence

23

indicating that, but we can determine from the

24

face of the complaint that Anthony Italiano

25

made an allegation of concrete injury within

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

the ambit of what Justice Thomas's concurrence

2

in Spokeo indicated was acceptable and what

3

lower courts have unanimously indicated that it

4

was -- was acceptable.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was curious

6

where you were going to come down before you

7

filed your brief, because, obviously, if

8

there's no standing, the whole class action's

9

thrown out, right?

10

MR. FRANK:

That would be correct.

11

That would be the right thing to do under

12

Arizonans for Proper English, or Official

13

English.

14

The Court found that the lower courts did not

15

have jurisdiction and vacated everything.

16

That's exactly what the Court did.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Now you say -- to

17

follow up with Justice Kagan, who anticipated

18

exactly where I wanted to go -- you say there's

19

an allegation with respect to Mr. Italiano that

20

-- that he was injured.

21

was injured?

22

personal information, for example, wasn't

23

already available through the white pages and

24

otherwise published so that there is no injury

25

in fact?

But do we know that he

Is there any evidence that his

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. FRANK:

Well, that goes to the

2

merits.

3

punched me in the head and -- and owes me over

4

$75,000 and we're citizens of different states,

5

I have a claim for standing even if that claim

6

is completely fictional.

7

If I allege that my friend here

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, fair enough at

8

a 12(b)(6) stage, but, here, we're entering a

9

final judgment, and should we at least remand

10

to -- to a lower court to make a decision as to

11

whether there is actually standing as opposed

12

to a mere allegation of standing?

13

MR. FRANK:

I don't think that's the

14

case.

I think the -- the -- the allegation of

15

concrete injury establishes the standing, and

16

then the merits question's always different

17

than the jurisdictional question.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is the

19

private -- I mean, what I have here, my law

20

clerk looked it up, is that the search that Mr.

21

Italiano engaged in was his name, that's

22

certainly public, his home address, I imagine

23

that's public, name in bankruptcy, his name in

24

foreclosure proceedings, his name in short sale

25

proceedings, his name in Facebook, and his name

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

and the name of his then soon-to-be ex-wife and

2

the words "forensic accounting."

3

Now how, if that -- if those are all

4

the things that he looked up, how are the -­

5

what concrete injury was there because somebody

6

might discover through Google that he made

7

those searches?

8
9

I mean, I -- I don't quite see how
this is some kind of secret or private or -­

10

information.

And I don't see alleged anywhere

11

how those things were hurt.

12

time distinguishing this from Spokeo.

13

MR. FRANK:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I had a hard

Well, the Ninth Circuit -­
And -- and -- and the

15

statute -- and the judge, by the way, didn't

16

even try.

17

MR. FRANK:

I agree.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

He just said that the

19

very fact that the statute forbids it is

20

enough, which I think is one thing Spokeo says

21

that's wrong.

22

MR. FRANK:

I agree that the judge did

23

not apply the Spokeo standard.

And if you

24

think the Ninth Circuit would do something

25

differently here than it would in Spokeo or has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

a chance of doing something differently here,

2

then maybe the appropriate decision is to

3

remand and let them consider that.

4

And while the case for Mr. Italiano's

5

injury may be weak, which suggests why this

6

settled for such an infinitesimal amount of the

7

statutory damages, that does not change that

8

the allegation was made and that -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, the allegation

10

is made, but where is an allegation of some

kind of injury that would actually concretely

and particularly hurt him?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, again, though,

I think this gets -- we're stuck in the same

place, I think, which is that you have to

2

assume that that information isn't otherwise

3

available.

4

At least, fine, you don't want to

5

prove it, an allegation of it, there's no

6

allegation that that information wasn't

7

otherwise available.

8

So what do we do about that?

9

that's the part where -- that we're struggling

10
11

I think

with here.
MR. FRANK:

If the complaint is not

12

strong enough to establish the concrete injury

13

under what a majority of the Court indicated

14

would be sufficient under Spokeo and what the

15

lower courts have repeatedly found with respect

16

to Spokeo, then the appropriate decision is to

17

have a limited remand and take it back up,

18

assuming that the Court finds jurisdiction.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is -- putting

20

aside the question of whether it's pertinent to

21

the standing analysis, just so I understand the

22

claims, the disclosures go to any searches that

23

somebody engages in, correct?

24

MR. FRANK:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct.
Okay.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So it

Official - Subject to Final Review
22

may be that they have the wrong named plaintiff

2

if the disclosures are not private?

3

MR. FRANK:

If -- if both Gaos and

4

Italiano don't qualify, then they might have

5

the wrong named plaintiff.

6

plaintiffs satisfies it, though, under Rumsfeld

7

versus FAIR, that would be sufficient.

If one of the named

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

it has to be one of the named plaintiffs?

10
11

MR. FRANK:

But it -- but

It does have to be a named

plaintiff.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that?

MR. FRANK:

But your argument

seems like the system is working, not not

is affirmed by this Court.

I thought the circuits had

that.

It said all that's needed is that the

money is de minimis per class member.

And

10

that's at page 8 of the Petition Appendix.

11

we see that in our supplemental brief, where we

12

point out that in a case with 1.3 million class

13

members where every class member is

14

identifiable and 3 to 9 million dollars left

15

over, the court said that's de minimis and it's

16

okay to send all of that to a local university

where the defendant can name a chair after

itself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

4

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

5

IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY

6

MR. WALL:

7

it please the Court:

8

Two points.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

9

First, when the district

court here resolved Petitioners' objections,

10

approved the settlement agreement, and entered

11

it as a binding judgment that appears at pages

12

62 to 66 of the Petition Appendix, it was

13

exercising Article III jurisdiction, which

14

means the plaintiffs had to have standing and

15

the court's ordered cy pres relief had to

16

redress plaintiffs' injuries under Laidlaw.

17

Neither of those is likely true here.

18

Second, the other limitations of

19

feasibility and fee proportionality should not

20

be paper tigers.

21

rigorous numerical analyses of feasibility and

22

determine fees based on actual relief to the

23

class, not, as here, based on an inflated

24

percentage or multiplier.

25

are necessary to align incentives and deter

Lower courts need to conduct

Meaningful limits

1

abuse of the class action device.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't -- I

3

don't understand your argument on the fee.

4

mean, I think you either decide the cy pres

5

award provides relief or it doesn't provide

6

relief.

7

don't get a fee for it.

8

provide relief, then I don't know why the fee

9

should be cut back just because it's not money.

10

I

If it doesn't provide relief, you

MR. WALL:

But, if it does

Well, I still think you

11

have to look at what relief it provides to the

12

class.

13

lower courts are not being very rigorous with

14

respect to redressability and feasibility, and

15

it tightens the inquiry, I still think it's

16

possible to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that

17

tailored cy pres provides some benefit to the

18

class but not benefit that should be treated

19

dollar for dollar like money in the pocket of

20

the class members.

21

If the Court agrees with us that the

But, I mean, I'd certainly agree that

22

not much of a discount would be warranted if

23

you've got really tailored cy pres.

24

problem here is that, of the six proposals,

25

only one even argued the World Privacy Forum's

case.

6

And the other four just deal with Internet

7

privacy in general.

And this wasn't even a fraud

All the fraud claims were dismissed.

9

The -­

And I think if -- if the inquiry is -­
if cy pres is going to be so far divorced

10

despite I think -- what I think are serious

11

redressability concerns from the claimed

12

injuries, then I don't think we can treat it

13

anywhere near dollar for dollar.

14

discount has to be more substantial.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the

Is there any reason

16

why we should not decide the standing question?

17

It's a question of law.

18

it's the plaintiff's obligation to allege

19

standing.

20

sufficiently, then -- then we should -- then

21

there isn't any standing.

22
23
24
25

At the 12(b)(6) stage,

If it wasn't alleged properly,

Why -- why does -- why is a remand
necessary?
MR. WALL:

I think the Court could

decide it, Justice Alito.

I think it could

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

decide it or remand.

We would urge the Court

2

to do either of those, rather than DIG.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. WALL:

But -­

Yeah, but why remand?

Well, because I think -­

5

and Justice Gorsuch was getting at this a

6

little bit -- it isn't clear -- the -- the

7

common law tort that everybody keeps pointing

8

to required public disclosure of private facts

9

about you.

10

Here, we know that somebody searched

11

Mr. Italiano's name, but from the fact that

12

somebody searches my name, it doesn't mean it

13

was me.

14

re-identification theory saying, oh, well, the

15

websites you click through to will glean other

16

information about you off of the Internet and

17

they'll be able then to reverse-engineer and

18

figure out that you were the one that did the

19

search.

20

So they've developed this

That seems pretty speculative, I

21

think, for Spokeo purposes, and there isn't a

22

record on it, though I don't know that the

23

Court needs one.

24

even if you could identify that these people

25

were the ones doing the searches, if they're

And then, even beyond that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

searching information that's already public and

2

they're not pointing to any other additional

3

harm, is that harm under Spokeo, I think that

4

latter part of it is a legal inquiry that I

5

agree, I think the Court is as well positioned

6

as the lower court to decide.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, do you think

8

that every time we get a case where there's

9

been a dismissal at the pleadings stage and a

10

question of standing arises, we should remand

11

it to the lower court to see whether the

12

plaintiff might be able to come up with some

13

additional allegations, or should we decide

14

whether the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged

15

standing, as the plaintiff must sufficiently

16

allege all the elements of whatever claim is

17

being pressed?

18

MR. WALL:

I -- Justice Alito, I think

19

the Court could decide it.

20

that, on the basis of these allegations, it's

21

got enough to decide the standing question, I

22

think it could do that here.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the Court thinks

We know this, on that

24

very point -- we have in the complaint, quote

25

-- there was one search that was his name,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

Italiano, and then, quote, "the name of his

2

then soon-to-be ex-wife."

3

All right.

End quote.

Now was the search, the

4

words -- it couldn't have been "the name" -­

5

there must have been a different actual search.

6

Do we know what it was, and were the words in

7

the search "soon-to-be ex-wife"?

8

words would seem private.

9

but maybe those words weren't there.

Because those

Probably.

And -­
Maybe all

10

that was there was his name and his wife's

11

name, which I don't think is private.

12

but -- but -- so do we know?

13

MR. WALL:

But -­

So, in fairness to their

14

theory, Justice Breyer, I don't think it's the

15

-- I don't think that what they're pointing the

16

harm is the disclosure of the information

17

itself.

18

is the disclosure that they performed that

19

search.

20

embarrass or harm you.

was his own name, is that a sufficient harm for

And -- and what -­

-- though, that the

predicate problem and the reason I think you

don't even get there is this re-identification

And what is the record

10

with respect to that question, about whether

11

anybody can identify the person who did the

12

search?

13

MR. WALL:

As far as we can tell,

14

there is no record because the district court

15

never reexamined this post-Spokeo and no one

16

raised it, either because they were bound not

17

to attack the settlement agreement or because

18

they wanted a ruling on the merits of cy pres.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

General Wall, what's

20

the -- what's the government's position on

21

Justice Thomas's theory in Spokeo that standing

22

can be proven by violation of a legal right

23

granted by Congress, even if it wouldn't be

24

otherwise recognized at common law?

25

MR. WALL:

We have not taken a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

position on that here, Justice Gorsuch.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that a reason

12

why we should -- we should not decide it in the

14

MR. WALL:

Justice Ginsburg, for the

15

reasons I gave earlier, I think the Court could

16

on this record or it could remand.

17

the Court doesn't DIG, both because it would

18

leave standing, a judgment that I think the

19

Court had no jurisdiction to enter, and I think

20

it would encourage parties not to flag

21

jurisdictional issues at the cert stage, as the

22

parties here should have.

As long as

23

And just to say one word about the

24

merits, I do think if the Court reaches the

25

merits, the government's primary submission is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

the lower courts have just not been very

2

rigorous.

3

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Why -- why -- to

4

pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question

5

earlier -- why shouldn't that be a question for

6

the Rules Committee in Congress to address in

7

the first instance?

8
9

MR. WALL:

Well, so, look, guidance

from Congress would be helpful, but in its

10

absence, I still think we have to say what the

11

fair, reasonable, and adequate standard means

12

under Rule 23.

13

The Rules Committee has essentially

14

punted to the courts by saying the courts are

15

actively looking at this issue, we're not going

16

to address it.

17

Now they did amend the rule in various

18

ways that I think support our approach by

19

saying you should consider fees at the 23(e)

20

stage, you can delay to see what the claims

21

rate is, the court should be looking at the

22

claims rate.

23

I mean, a number of the things that

24

they've done in the amended rule, I think, are

25

designed to tighten up the inquiry.

They're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

consistent with what we're saying here.

2

But they didn't directly tackle the

question.

4

courts.

5

essentially the -- the reasons that Petitioners

6

give, there are these three important

7

limitations that the Court should articulate

8

and they should have real teeth.

9

They, in effect, deferred to the
And so what we would say is, for

I think the way that Respondents talk

10

about them, as applied here, they don't have

11

12

13

analysis of redressability.

14

fees were bumped up to $2.1 million through a

15

2.2 multiplier that's essentially sort of

16

plucked out of the air.

There wasn't a real
And $950,000 in

17

It's just a reverse justification for

18

taking $2 million in fees off of an $8 million

19

settlement that didn't actually deliver any

20

relief to the class on its specific claim here,

21

which is that there's a referrer header that

22

turns over my information.

23

And all three of those seem like

24

serious problems.

And I think that it's

25

important that, if the Court reached the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37

merits, that it tighten them up so that we

2

don't have cy pres that's completely untethered

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
To the extent Petitioners are arguing

15

for a per se rule invalidating settlements,

16

where the monetary payments only go to third

17

parties, nothing in the Rules Enabling Act or

18

Rule 23 authorizes a flat prohibition.

19

And as Justice Sotomayor indicated and

20

Judge -- Professor Rubenstein's amicus brief

21

submits, these are very, very rare settlements.

22

But Rule 23(e)'s requirement that

settlements be fair, reasonable, and adequate

does impose significant constraints, which is

why I think these settlements are rare.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PINCUS:

We agree with the

government that there's a serious question

11

about whether this action was ever properly in

12

federal court and that the standing issue has

13

to be addressed before the court could

14

determine the questions presented.

15

So that means either the case should

16

be dismissed as improvidently granted, there

17

should be remand, or the Court should decide

18

the question.

19

complicated under Spokeo.

20

I think the question is

Mr. Italiano was the only plaintiff

21

whose claims weren't addressed by the district

22

court.

23

to have a sufficient allegation of injury, we

24

think it depends on this re-identification

theory, as General Wall indicated.

In -- in order for his claim -- for him

And the complaint in paragraphs 88 and

happen, a website operator has to get more than

5

the searches together to figure out who's

7

There's no allegation here that Mr.

that the re-identification could take place.

Here, the plaintiff class was everyone

and what plaintiffs would have to show to prove

MR. PINCUS:

So could you tell me the

Well, I think this is one

6

of the reasons why more information, either

7

re-briefing here or a remand is necessary, but

8

what would have to be alleged would be that

9

enough referrer headers went to a single

10

website operator that that website operator

could combine them and say:

figure out that this is the person who made the

I'm not sure that would be enough.

15

indicate that actual imminent damages are

required for privacy violations.

In other words, the -- the mere

I think -- I think that's a question -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

We're just talking

about harm, and you don't have a mini-trial on

4

whether the harm, sufficient for standing, is

proved.

can be contested by a defendant.

23

recognized?

24

question is, is it an intangible harm that

And then, if it's not, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

because of what Congress may have elevated

2

makes it a harm that's actionable?

3

And I think, under the Stored

4

Communications Act, there's a real question.

5

It's an Act that both requires that a plaintiff

6

be aggrieved and it's an Act that two circuits

7

have said requires proof of actual damages to

recover.

9

And so the -- I think there's a very

significant question about whether that Act

12

can repurpose it to a different thing, to a

there anything in Rule 23(e) that says that

25

exactly what the Beastie Boys or any other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

And Rule 23(e) doesn't answer that

question by saying never.

4

question by providing a standard of fairness,

5

reasonableness, and adequacy.

6
7
8
9

It answers that

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The question's

what reasonableness means.
MR. LAMKEN:

I think that's right.

And the question is -- and the answer to that,

10

I think, is when the alternative, when you have

11

a possibility of getting millions of dollars of

12

indirect relief, it is better, it is fair,

13

reasonable, and adequate, to get that when the

14

alternative is likely nothing or the nominal

15

equivalent of nothing.

16

And that's the fundamental decision

17

that ALI made.

If it's infeasible, if it's not

18

possible to give this money out to people

19

without it becoming practically zero or there's

20

a grave risk of that happening, then you can

21

take the money and give it to institutions for

22

particular uses that serve the interests of the

23

individual class members.

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, the decision is

5

initially made by the class representatives and

6

the lawyers, and it's subject to judicial

7

review by the court.

8

rather than simply giving money to -- and,

9

frankly, this is an issue that's not before the

And that -- in this case,

10

Court because Petitioner didn't challenge the

11

requisite nexus between the recipients and the

12

interests of the class members.

13

But turning to it anyway, in this

14

case, specific proposals were provided, and

15

those proposals are actually quite closely

16

linked to not just the injury that occurred

17

here, that underlies both the cause of action

18

and the actual complaint, but also the specific

19

class.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But there is the

21

appearance, as the district court said in the

22

hearing, the appearance of favoritism and alma

23

maters of -- of counsel.

24
25

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, I think, in

this case, the district court acknowledged that

5

my degree from Harvard and that's simply the

6

end of it.

7

He took

He heard counsel -- from counsel
I got

He reviewed detailed proposals which

8

carefully calibrated the -- the money to the

9

specific harms, the impact of search terms and

10

disclosures and third-party data flows.

11

the district court found "no indication" that

12

counsel's allegiance to alma maters factored

13

into selection.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, don't

15

you think it's just a little bit fishy that the

16

money goes to a charity or a 501(c)(3)

17

organization that Google had contributed to in

18

the past?

19

MR. LAMKEN:

So, Your Honor, remember,

20

because we're in the high-tech area and we're

21

in an emerging area, there's only so many

22

organizations that are going to have track

23

records of this.

24

surprising -­

25

And so it's not at all

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I bet there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

are other organizations active in the area that

2

Google had not contributed to in the past.

3

MR. LAMKEN:

And -- and many were

4

included here.

But one of the critical things

5

is, while Google was involved -- and this is at

6

page 40 of the Joint Appendix -- it was

7

involved in identifying potential recipients,

8

it -- counsel for class, the class, not Google,

9

vetted the actual proposals.

Class counsel,

10

not Google, determined which recipients.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know,

12

but the allegation -- you know, I mean, the

13

allegation is that counsel for the class and

14

the defendant are working together because no

15

money is going to anybody else, it's just going

16

to counsel for the -- for the class, and that

17

Google for its part as part of the deal -- I'm

18

not suggesting that's what's going on -- but

19

the allegation, it says part of the deal, they

20

get to give money to their favorite charity.

21

MR. LAMKEN:

And the district court

22

looked at it and understood that Google's role

23

ended at selecting potential recipients.

24

had no role in deciding who got how much money

25

either.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The appearance

problem here, which has happened in many cases,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

is symptomatic of a broader question, which is

2

why is it not always reasonable, more

3

reasonable in this situation, which is a

4

difficult one, to try to get the money to

5

injured parties, either through pro rata

6

distribution or some kind of lottery system.

7

Imperfect or strange as that may be,

8

it seems to me potentially less strange or why

9

isn't it less strange than giving it to people

10

who weren't injured at all, who have

11

affiliations with the counsel, and who in many

12

cases don't need the money?

13

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, in terms of

14

what the standard is, yes, absolutely, the

15

priority is to give the individual class

16

members money.

17

And only when it proves infeasible to do that

18

can you go to a cy pres result.

19

That's the number one priority.

And in this case -- and I turn the

20

Court to Pet App 47a -- the district court

21

actually found, he looked and said, the cost to

22

do claims processing, cost to do claims forms,

23

cost to do distribution, and said it's clearly

24

infeasible when you look at those factors.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

How about a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

lottery versus this?

2

MR. LAMKEN:

So the lottery doesn't

3

really help much for two reasons.

First, you

4

have to go and identify the class members in

5

order to determine who do you give your lottery

6

tickets to.

7

the names of the 129 million people, or however

8

many you're going to submit, and ask.

9

to process and determine, are these valid

So you now have to go out and find

You have

10

requests for lottery tickets, or is this person

11

not a Google user?

12

So you have to verify.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But at least it's

13

someone who -- who, quote, to use your analogy,

14

paid for the lottery ticket as opposed to

15

giving the billion dollar award to someone who

16

didn't buy the lottery ticket.

17

MR. LAMKEN:

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

19

Well, I think -­
I mean, that's the

--

20

MR. LAMKEN:

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22

your analogy, the -­

23

MR. LAMKEN:

-- it is a little -­
-- that's, to use

It's a little passing

24

strange to start -- to use all the money,

25

virtually all the money, to actually set up

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

this lottery process to accept all these

2

claims, administer that process, and then

3

exclude the vast majority of the class and say:

4

And we're going to take some people who were

5

injured and entitled to money, and we're not

6

going to give them their money, we're going to

7

give that money to somebody else because they

8

won the lottery.

9

It's just a little unseemly, in

10

addition to being grossly inefficient, because

11

the only thing it reduces -- it doesn't reduce

12

claims administration cost in terms of

13

accepting claims.

14

administration cost in terms of vetting the

15

claims.

16

mailing cost.

17

It doesn't reduce claims

The only thing it reduces is the end
That's the only thing it does.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It -- it reduces,

18

to pick up on the Chief Justice's comments, the

19

appearance of favoritism and collusion -­

20

MR. LAMKEN:

And that -­

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- which is rife

22

in these cases.

At least that's been the

23

allegation.

24

that have said that.

25

here, as you know in the transcript, was very

There have been lots of courts
And the district court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

concerned about that.

2

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, he wasn't concerned

3

about the collusion because he specifically

4

found that it did not enter into the decision.

5

And if the district court had -- the standard

6

everyone agrees is, if there's even doubt, if

7

there's substantial doubt about whether the

8

recipients were selected on the merits, that

9

doubt is called against the settlement.

10

It's

called in favor of trying something different.

11

But, in this case, the court of

12

appeals and the district court both applied

13

that -- that ALI standard and both determined

14

that, after looking at all the evidence, after

15

looking at the detailed proposals, after

16

hearing from counsel, after doing all that,

17

there wasn't that substantial doubt.

18

And I think we can rely on our

19

district courts to make those determinations,

20

to be careful, and to not get engaged in the

21

type of process that brings the judiciary into

22

disrepute.

23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, if you step

back -­
MR. LAMKEN:

Now if someone's opposed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

--

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- if you step back

3

from what happened in this case and cases like

4

this, how can you say that it makes any sense?

5

The purpose of asking for compensation, it's

6

not injunctive relief that would benefit a -­

7

benefit a broad class, but the purpose -­

8

benefit the public -- it's compensation for the

9

-- for the class members.

10

And at the end of the day, what

11

happens?

12

it.

13

And money is given to organizations that they

14

may or may not like and that may or may not

15

ever do anything that is of even indirect

16

benefit to them.

17

The attorneys get money, and a lot of

The class members get no money whatsoever.

So how can -- how can such a system be

18

regarded as a sensible system?

19

MR. LAMKEN:

So two parts to that.

20

The first is, with respect to fees, and we

21

don't believe -- because that's Rule 24(h), a

22

reasonable fee adder.

23

before the Court either.

24
25

We don't think that's

But, with respect to fees, it's well
established that a court can reduce attorneys'

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

fees if it believes that the cy pres

2

distribution is less valuable to the class than

3

its cash equivalent.

4

It just happened in this case the

5

district court heard objectors' arguments and

6

said that he did not agree that the fees and

7

incentive awards are inconsistent with the

8

value of the class benefit, specific finding on

9

Pet App 60.

10

Moreover, class counsel's request is

11

not disproportionate to the class benefit.

12

this is a situation where district courts on

13

the ground can value what is the cy pres

14

benefit and then make a determination:

15

fee a disproportionate result?

16

reduce it.

17

in a number of cases reduced fees because it's

18

a cy pres distribution.

19

So

Is the

And they can

And, in fact, they have in the past

The second part, Justice Alito, is

20

that somehow this distribution doesn't benefit

21

the class.

22

simply take money and give it to charity that

23

happens to be in a space that's similar to or

24

occupied by the underlying injuries.

25

But this isn't a case where you

There are specific proposals here with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

a very close nexus.

The injury here is that

2

search terms are given out -- and I'm going to

3

come back to standing in a moment if I have

4

enough time -- but that search terms of

5

individuals are given out to third parties

6

without their consent.

7

And the Stored Communications Act is

8

very clear, it's not illegal to give out that

9

information if there is consent.

And both the

10

prospective relief, the modifications to

11

Google's FAQs, and all these organizations are

12

working towards making sure that the public is

13

properly notified that this is the consequence

14

of entering potentially extremely personal

15

information, what your worries, your concerns

16

are, into that search box will do.

17

So it is not at all even remotely the

18

case that this is not benefitting the class.

19

This is targeted precisely to the type of

20

injury and precisely the type of problem,

21

privacy invasion, that that class is subjected

22

to.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You started -- you

24

started with what for me is a very good point,

25

which is why is this for us and not for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

Congress and the committee.

2

hand, the retort to that is that the committee

3

thinks it's for us.

4

But, on the other

And -- and -- and maybe Congress does,

5

too, because reasonable gives common law-like

6

power to the courts to figure out and to put

7

limits on these things.

8

Congress and the committee if they're thinking

9

that -­

10
11

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

-­

12
13

So how can we rely on

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- the court's

going to do it?

14

MR. LAMKEN:

-- what the Court has

15

before it is the text of the rule, and the one

16

thing the Court can't do is substitute some

17

categorical rule that it thinks more efficient

18

or better than the rule itself.

19

We have to apply the rule -­

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But isn't that

21

what courts do all the time with the word

22

"reasonable," is over time apply -- learn from

23

experience and then draw sometimes bright-line

24

rules?

25

MR. LAMKEN:

As in Rule 23(h), where

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

it's a reasonable fee, courts typically fill

2

reasonableness with factors and considerations.

3

They typically don't substitute a different

4

test, such as to say cy pres is never fair,

5

reasonable, and adequate.

6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it certainly -­
Mr. Lamken -- I'm

sorry, please.
MR. LAMKEN:

No, and it certainly

should be fair, reasonable, and adequate when
the alternative is nothing.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask you to

address standing, please?
MR. LAMKEN:

Yes.

Okay.

So turning

14

to standing very quickly.

15

below addressed the Stored Communications Act

16

or the other four causes of action under the

17

standard of Spokeo.

18

There's a dearth of authority on it.

19

Look, neither court

Very few courts have.

So this isn't a situation where the

20

Court should be going out on its own and

21

addressing the issue without the benefit of the

22

viewpoints of other jurists, without the

23

benefit of the refinement that occurs when the

24

case comes up from the lower courts.

25

They simply didn't apply that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

standard.

So the Court has two options in our

2

view.

3

dismiss as improvidently granted.

One is to remand.

The alternative is to

4

If the Court were inclined to think it

5

might grant again, I think that remand would be

6

the right answer, but this Court is so -- this

7

case is so rife with vehicle problems that I

8

think the proper answer under those

9

circumstances is to dismiss as improvidently

10

granted, but that aside, that is in the Court's

11

discretion.

12
13

Turning to the merits, if the Court
were to be the first to address this issue -­

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can take

an extra minute on standing.

16

MR. LAMKEN:

Okay.

If the Court were

17

to be the first to address the Stored

18

Communications Act under Spokeo, since the

19

framing, the rule has been the disclosure of

20

another's communication without their consent

21

is actionable.

22

And the Court can look to Justice

23

Story's opinion in Folsom versus Marsh for

24

that.

25

permitted to disclose that letter without the

Even the recipient of a letter was not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

author's permission.

2

This -- in Bartnicki versus Vopper,

3

that issue was thoroughly briefed by the United

4

States, among others, and the Court in Doe

5

versus Chao recognized that, for privacy harms,

6

they're often actionable without specific harm,

7

that the damage is presumed.

8
9

Congress is entitled to make that same
judgment in -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The -- the alleged

11

injury here, am I correct, is that a

12

third-party will know that a particular person

13

did the search.

14

simply the nature of the search.

15

correct?

16

It's not what -- it's not

MR. LAMKEN:

Is that

I think that when it's

17

associated with you, that -- that is an injury.

18

But merely disclosing your letter, even if it

19

was an anonymous letter, to a third-party, I

20

think that would have been actionable at common

21

law.

22

the framing.

23

That would have been actionable before

But -- and Congress did make the

24

judgment in this case that, even without

25

individual actual harm, that the presumed harm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

is a submission because it gave as damages not

2

just actual harm, it gave as damages the

3

wrongdoer's profits.

4

to recover the wrongdoer's profits, which,

5

again, is consistent with the common law.

6

There's entitlement

But this is an extraordinarily complex

7

issue.

You have to go deep into history that,

8

in the pageant pages we had, we didn't.

9

think, under the circumstances, the right

I

10

answer for the Court, given that this is a

11

jurisdictional question, is to dismiss or -- is

12

to remand or dismiss as improvidently granted.

13

Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

counsel.
Mr. Frank, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE H. FRANK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRANK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
My friend is alleging that the

23

district court made factual findings that it

24

simply did not reach because it believed its

25

hands were tied by the Ninth Circuit precedent.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
71
1

It did not look at the potential

2

conflicts between Google and the recipients

3

because, in Lane versus Facebook, the Ninth

4

Circuit approved a settlement where Facebook

5

gave to a charity created by Facebook.

6

It did not look at the difficulty of

7

distributing to some class members because the

8

Ninth Circuit has a de minimis standard.

9

as we discuss at page 22 of our reply brief,

And

10

what the district court found was that it would

11

be too hard to distribute to over 100 million

12

class members.

13

that's not the standard under any other court.

14

We don't contest that, but

So returning to the question that a

15

number of Justices raised, why not leave this

16

to Congress?

17

State Oil versus Khan, where the Court was

18

interpreting restraint of trade under the

19

Sherman Act.

20

that, but it already had a three-decade-old

21

precedent, Albrecht, that it was being asked to

22

reverse.

23

And I return to the example of

And not only was it interpreting

And Congress had specifically

24

considered the rule in Albrecht over the -­

25

those three decades and it never acted on it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
72
1

Yet, in 522 U.S. 3, State Oil versus Khan, the

2

Court unanimously reversed Albrecht and came to

3

the economically sound conclusion about the way

4

to interpret restraint of trade.

5

And we have courts here that are

6

already importing a proportionality requirement

7

into the reasonableness and fairness inquiries,

8

and at no point do my friends indicate that

9

Pearson versus NBTY, the Seventh Circuit

10

decision, is wrong or why it's wrong or why it

11

is not the superior rule here.

12

And as we document in our opening

13

brief, when courts demand that counsel is

14

faithful to their fiduciary obligations,

15

counsel responds to those incentives.

16

The Ninth Circuit's rule creates

17

incentives for class counsel to argue that it's

18

too hard to get money to the class, and, in

19

fact, the de minimis rule would take many

20

settlements that are settling now for less than

21

$1 per class member, for less than $2 per class

22

member, that distribute tens of millions, even

23

over $100 million to class members, it's now

24

appropriate under the Ninth Circuit's rule to

25

take all of that money and give it to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
73
1

defendant's favorite charity or the plaintiff's

2

favorite charity.

3
4

If there are no further questions, I'd
ask the Court to vacate and reverse.
