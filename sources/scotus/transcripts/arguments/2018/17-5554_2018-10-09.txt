CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Stokeling versus United States.

Ms. Bryn.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA G. BRYN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. BRYN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Since the invalidation of the residual

12

clause in 2015, the only way for a state

13

robbery offense to qualify as an ACCA violent

14

felony is if it has violent force as an

15

element.

16

element because it requires only slight force

17

to overcome slight victim resistance.

Florida robbery does not have that

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your -- your

19

position is no robbery conviction in Florida

20

counts under the Armed Career Criminal offense?

21

A robbery in Florida is out entirely?

22

MS. BRYN:

Because of the categorical

23

approach.

Because the least culpable conduct

24

for robbery in Florida does not require violent

25

force.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Does

2

that apply -- your answer apply to the armed

3

robbery subsections of the Florida statute?

4

MS. BRYN:

In the Florida statute,

5

yes, because armed robbery in Florida does not

6

require using or brandishing or displaying or

7

even representing that one has a weapon.

8

only requires carrying.

9

It

But in most states that have armed

10

robbery, aggravated robbery offenses that

11

require using, displaying, threatening a

12

weapon, those offenses would qualify because

13

that's a threatened use of violent force.

14

Florida juries are instructed every

15

day in Florida that although resistance is

16

required, no particular degree of resistance is

17

required.

18

particular extent, and, in fact, the case law

19

in Florida confirms that resistance sufficient

20

for a robbery conviction and a penalty up to 15

21

years in the state penitentiary can involve

22

nothing more than the tightening of one's hand

23

momentarily on a dollar bill before releasing

24

it.

25

A victim can resist to any

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I actually

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tried that, holding, since I knew this was -­

2

this was your most -- this was your most

3

important case, and I held on to a dollar bill

4

and asked each of my law clerks to try to pull

5

it out of my hand.

6

mean, people think, oh, it tears easily.

7

it tears easily if you go like this, but if

8

you're really tugging on it -- I mean, it's -­

9

I'm not saying nobody could do it, but -- but

10

And I was surprised.

(Laughter.)

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Well,

it requires -­

11

13

I

-- a lot of

force, more than you might think.
MS. BRYN:

I don't think, Your Honor,

15

that it requires a substantial degree of force

16

as this Court defined that in Curtis Johnson

17

using the adjectives, all of which connote

18

actual violence, which are severe force,

19

extreme, furious, vehement, strong, and

20

powerful force.

21

Clearly, there is some force involved.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it also

23

said -- it also said -- and this, of course, is

24

the language your friend on the other side

25

stresses -- capable of causing physical pain or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

injury.

2

than some of the other adjectives that were in

3

the same paragraph.

4

You know, that covers a broader area

MS. BRYN:

The -- the phrase "force

5

capable of causing pain or injury" has to be

6

understood in context, and it is explaining

7

violent force in the context of a violent

8

felony definition.

9

The Court emphasized the word

10

"violence" by italicizing it, and then the

11

Court gave all of these ordinary dictionary

12

definitions of "violence" or "violent" which

13

are extreme force, vehement, furious force.

14

So I -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that -­

16

do you think that shoving, grabbing, and

17

pinching count as physical force under ACCA?

18

MS. BRYN:

Your Honor, the

19

determination under ACCA cannot be made in a

20

vacuum.

21

of conduct, I guess we can say, besides

22

stabbing someone in the back directly would

23

involve that.

24
25

So there's no -- there's no category

Most conduct has to be viewed in
context.

For instance, the Court gave the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

example in ACCA of a slap to the face.

In

2

Castleman, they gave the example of a squeeze

3

to the arm.

4

actual category.

So you have to look beyond the

5

And one very powerful -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought under

7

the categorical approach, you have to look at

8

the category.

9

you can't answer that question.

So I really don't understand why

10

MS. BRYN:

Well, they have -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does pinching, for

12

example, constitute physical force sufficient

13

to -- to activate ACCA?

14

MS. BRYN:

The categorical approach

15

actually does not require you to look at a

16

category.

17

actual cases and determine what the least

18

culpable conduct for a conviction, and that

19

conduct does not exist in a vacuum.

20

It requires you to look at the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, we used

21

the example of a tap on the shoulder not being

22

sufficient force.

23

Alito's hypothetical?

So can you answer Justice

24

MS. BRYN:

Right.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is a pinch, an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

ordinary pinch -- let's not talk about an

2

extraordinary -­

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- pulling of the

5

ears that a parent might sometimes do.

6

talk about just a pinch.

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

force?

Let's

Is that sufficient

If we said a tap on the shoulder

couldn't be, why could a pinch be?

11

MS. BRYN:

I -- I think the -- the

12

answer is looking at the -- the other side of

13

the equation from what a substantial degree of

14

force is.

15

capable of -- of causing pain or injury.

16

think the only way to read that explanation of

17

violent force is as force that's -- a degree of

18

force that's reasonably expected to cause pain

19

or injury.

And Your Honor mentioned force

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. BRYN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I

You've -­

I don't think a pinch -­
-- you've said the

23

an injured shoulder, it could cause injury.

It's capable of causing physical pain and

MS. BRYN:

The -- the reason that we

16

have articulated reasonably expected is to

17

contrast with an outlier case.

18

Honor mentioned, a tap can cause pain or injury

19

if you have an injured shoulder, if the victim

20

has some unique susceptibility to pain.

21

that's why it is difficult to talk about

categories, and you have to look at the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Bryn, I wonder if

2

you could say a bit more about this reasonable

3

expectation standard, because I'm not sure it

4

does all that much that's different from what

5

the government's standard does.

6

I mean, if you take something like

7

grabbing money out of a hand and say could that

8

reasonably be expected to cause pain or injury,

9

well, maybe some injury, maybe a bruise, maybe

10
11

a little scratch, maybe a little cut.
And, similarly, even a pinch.

I mean,

12

reasonably expected to cause pain?

13

while, for a moment.

14

really help to distinguish the kinds of cases

15

that you want to distinguish?

16

MS. BRYN:

Sure, for a

So how does your standard

Because I think the

17

categorical approach requires you to look at

18

real cases, and our real cases involve this

19

minimal pulling or tugging action that resulted

20

in no pain or injury.

21

powerful -­

22

And that's a very

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That -- that could

23

be in a particular case, but don't you have to

24

take the conduct in -- in general?

25

particularly Justice Alito's question about

And

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

pinching, there are some people who have thin

2

skin and bruise very easily, and a pinch would

3

probably be sufficient to cause bruising,

4

actual injury.

5

MS. BRYN:

Right.

So that would not

6

be a circumstance known to the perpetrator.

7

And the test that the Court set forth in Curtis

8

Johnson by specifying over and over again that

9

it's a degree of force, and the Court used the

10

word "degree" four separate times, is a test

11

that is focused on the perpetrator, not on the

12

victim.

13

I mean, we -- we all know from first

14

year of law school that there are eggshell

15

plaintiffs.

16

predict future violence with a gun for people

17

who possess a gun, who would be the people that

18

would be willing to pull a trigger and kill

19

someone.

20

And the purpose of ACCA is to

So, if there is an incidental injury,

21

an accidental injury that no one could have

22

imagined because someone does have thin skin or

23

someone has just had shoulder surgery or has a

24

tender area of their body, it would -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But my question wasn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

that.

2

was the ordinary person who can reasonably be

3

expected to suffer some, even if minimal, pain

4

or injury, the pain that a pinch causes or the

5

injury that comes from your hand being bruised

6

when somebody tries to grab some cash out of

7

it.

8
9

It wasn't the eggshell plaintiff.

It

And I guess I was -- I was confused
that you wanted to use this standard,

10

"reasonably be expected to cause pain or

11

injury," because it does seem to me as though a

12

lot of minor activity could -- could satisfy

13

that standard.

14

MS. BRYN:

So that's why we -- we have

15

said, number one, that whether there is an

16

actual pain or injury in the actual reported

17

cases, what has been prosecuted by the state?

18

Has the state prosecuted for no injury or for

19

exceedingly minor injuries?

20

prosecute for no injury.

21

In Florida, they

So even though it is possible to

22

hypothesize a case where the same conduct might

23

cause injury, I mean, we think those are

24

outlier cases because the real cases that

25

resulted in prosecution in our state have not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

resulted in injury.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MS. BRYN:

4
5

How -- how -­

We're not saying it can

never happen.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- how -- how then

6

would you -- you -- would you describe an ACCA

7

qualifying physical force?

8

your definition?

9

MS. BRYN:

Yes.

Can you give us

It's a degree of

10

force that is substantial enough to be

11

reasonably expected to cause pain or injury in

12

most cases, rather than an outlier case.

13

And in -- in determining whether the

14

offenses under our statute match that, a

15

powerful circumstance is if the conduct has not

16

resulted in any pain or injury.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

In Taylor, the Court

18

said that the revision of ACCA to include the

19

elements clause expanded the predicate offenses

20

beyond just robbery and burglary.

21

But we are told that your reading of

22

the statute would knock out robbery offenses in

23

30 to 40 case -- in 30 to 40 states.

24
25

What is your response to that?

Does

that seem -- does it seem likely that that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

what Congress was intending to do?

2

MS. BRYN:

3

two parts of that question.

4

to cover robbery in the expansion, robbery and

5

additional crimes.

6

that was by writing two different violent

7

felony definitions.

8
9

Well, there -- there are
Congress intended

The way it sought to do

One was very narrow and circumscribed.
That's the elements clause.

The other one was

10

quite expansive, capacious, and would sweep in

11

every type of robbery, even snatchings, even

12

not -- robberies, pickpocketings, theft

13

offenses that require no force whatsoever.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So your answer -- your

15

answer is that they thought that robbery was

16

going to be covered by the residual clause, is

17

that right?

18

MS. BRYN:

They wrote language that

19

would have covered it under the residual

20

clause.

21

This issue did not really come before the

22

Court.

23

And it did until three years ago.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, I'm stuck

24

there too, because if Congress uses the word

25

robbery, we wouldn't normally think that it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

excluding more than half the states' statutes

2

that are defining robbery.

3

That -- that -- that just seems like a

4

strike against the statutory reading you're

5

asking us to adopt.

6

there's the residual clause, but Congress used

7

the term "robbery" -­

And -- and I understand

8

MS. BRYN:

Well, it -­

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- and we've said it

10

used it in the ordinary sense at the time of

11

adoption.

12

appears that, as Justice Alito suggested, over

13

half the states would have included this kind

14

of conduct.

And at the time of adoption, it

Act and it deleted "robbery" in the '86 Act at

18

the same time that it continued to enumerate

19

burglary.

20

It used "robbery" in the '84

To capture the robberies, Congress had

21

two different definitions.

And as to whether

22

43 states would be knocked out by our

23

definition, as we have said in our reply brief

24

and demonstrated in our appendix, the

25

government has only matched words in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

statute, the word "force" and the word

2

"resistance."

3

It has not done what the categorical

4

approach requires, which is to take a deep dive

5

into state law.

you think will be knocked out?

because both -- it can't pick up under armed

robbery what it loses under unarmed robbery for

the reason that you said earlier.

16

Because, I

Presumably, there are other states in

as -- as under the -- this clause.

states do you think are going to be in

Florida's position that none of their robbery

statutes count under this clause?

of any degree of resistance, number one.

that any degree of force can overcome any

We've listed those in our appendix.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in how many

2

states would common law robbery, would simple

3

robbery, not armed robbery or an aggravated

4

form of robbery, be knocked out by your

5

understanding of the statute?

6

MS. BRYN:

So, again, it -- it's -­

7

it's hard to give an actual number.

8

from the -- the mistakes that were made in the

9

government's appendix, that's really a fraught

10

inquiry, but what I would suggest is that it's

11

really only a handful, maybe six states or

12

less, that are like Florida in having

applications.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you think that in

it's necessary to look to the cases that are

MS. BRYN:

Yes, I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

to -- to -- beyond the statute, you have to

25

look to prosecutorial policies and practices?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. BRYN:

That -- that's what the

2

Court said in Duenas-Alvarez, to determine if a

3

statute can be or has been applied to

4

non-violent, non-generic conduct or in an

5

overbroad way.

6

7

The only way you can know that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, even if the

8

conduct?

10

MS. BRYN:

The statute -- well, first

11

of all, the Florida statute on its face does

12

not even include resistance.

13

14

states as well.

15

That's been

But let's say there's a statute that

16

uses the term "resistance" or overcoming

17

resistance and force.

18

Still, what the Court said in Curtis

19

Johnson is that this Court, federal courts,

20

have to defer to the state's interpretation of

21

their elements.

22

In our appendix, we cited a Michigan

23

case that -- that -- the statute uses the term

says spitting is sufficient violence for the

there are no -- no broad principles embraced by

14

will be a state-by-state inquiry, but all of

Florida law, and I have looked at other states'

21

law, and I can tell you that not many states

22

are like Florida in having everything.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, let's say

24

we -- we disagree with your understanding of

25

Duenas, and we think that if it's clear on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

face of a statute that conduct is encompassed.

2

Under the elements approach in Taylor, then

3

that's how we would define it.

4

Does that alter the number of states

5

that you think would be knocked out under your

6

approach?

7

MS. BRYN:

Well, I've already knocked

8

out, I -- I believe, at least 10 states on -­

9

in my approach by reporting in our appendix the

10

full language of the statute that the

11

government excerpted out of its own appendix.

12

So statutes which make clear on the

13

face of the statute that violence can be

14

contact.

15

Mere touching, any impact.
So, yes, that reduces the number.

16

But, other than that, once we are down to

17

force, violence, and resistance, those are

18

common words that come from the common law, but

19

each state has gone in its own direction.

20

And in order to properly do the

21

categorical approach under the elements clause,

22

you have to defer to the interpretation of

23

those elements.

24
25

It's a different type of inquiry than
for the generic offense determination.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Some

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

generic offense determinations can be made on

2

the face of the statute because the statutory

3

language is plain, but, as we have shown by

4

case law showing that resistance can be nothing

5

more than the momentary tightening of one's

6

hand, that the word "resistance" does not have

7

a meaning in and of itself.

8

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but,

9

counsel -- counsel, in Curtis Johnson, you rely

10

heavily on the general statements of the Court,

11

but the application of those general statements

12

was to something very specific:

13

mere tap on the shoulder.

14

Johnson seemed to hold was that that was

excluded.

And all Curtis

So why don't we follow what Curtis

17

Johnson seemed to do in applying those general

18

statements to the specific statute at issue

19

here, and why wouldn't that then encompass the

20

Florida statute, which requires more than, say,

21

a tap on the shoulder?

22

MS. BRYN:

Because what the Court did

23

before applying the standard to the statute -­

24

to the Florida battery statute was to

25

definitively construe the words that -­

5

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But it -- as you

7

point out, it's -- it's a bit general, those

8

statements, that language.

9

understand what the Court meant by that?

And so how do we
You

10

look at how it applied it, and it was to a

11

battery statute, and it was a case where the

12

government argued that the mere tap on the

13

shoulder was okay.

And the Court said no,

14

that's not enough.

But all it seemed to carve

15

out was that kind of statute.

16

read page 139 of the Curtis Johnson opinion, it

17

seemed to very carefully distinguish those two

18

situations.

19

MS. BRYN:

At least as I

Your -- Your Honor, I -- I

20

disagree with that, because I believe that the

21

standard the -- the Court set forth was a

22

violent felony definition.

23

the word "violent" alone connotes a substantial

24

degree of force, and used words like "severe,"

25

"extreme," "vehement," "furious" to

The Court said that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

characterize and flesh out the concept of what

2

a substantial degree of force is.

3

And the conduct in our case, yes, it's

4

more than a mere touching, but it's not

5

extreme, furious, severe, vehement, any -- any

6

of the adjectives, the ordinary dictionary

7

terms, which -- which was the definition of

8

"violent force" the Court embraced in -- in

9

rejecting the common law view.

10

So the Court did not draw a line.

11

would have been a very short opinion if

12

touching is out and everything else is in.

13

we see from Castleman four years later that

14

other minor uses of force do not convey the

15

sense of violence in the -- the colloquial

16

sense, and the Court reinforced that in

17

Castleman.

18

It

And

So I think there's a lot more in the

19

definition of Curtis Johnson.

20

a substantial degree.

21

adjectives that meet it, and the conduct in

22

several of the Florida cases does not amount to

23

that level.

24

25

The standard was

MS. BRYN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
And in the ordinary

4

understanding of that, force sufficient to

overcome resistance would be physical force.

6

The holding in Curtis Johnson was what Justice

7

Kavanaugh described, battery -- the touching

that is necessary for a battery is not physical

force; any unwanted touching satisfies common

22

So, you know, what

As you -- you know, as you just

mentioned, if you have a very strong victim and

a very weak robber, an awful lot of force could

25

be applied without a reasonable possibility of

On the other hand, in what might

Mr. Liu.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LIU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
For centuries, the common law has

16

provided a basis to distinguish violent takings

17

of property from non-violent takings.

18

takings or robberies were takings that involved

19

the use of force sufficient to overcome the

20

victim's resistance.

21

Violent

That's the element of force that's

22

found in the robbery -- basic robbery statutes

23

of over 40 states, including Florida.

24

element of force that Congress used in its own

25

definition of robbery in the original 1984

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's the

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

ACCA.

2

And when Congress amended the ACCA two

3

years later, it took that element and made it

4

the centerpiece of the new elements clause.

5

Under Petitioner's interpretation of

6

the ACCA, however, common law robbery would not

7

qualify as an ACCA predicate.

8
9

In fact, Petitioner cannot identify a
single state whose basic robbery statute,

10

whether based on the common law or not, would

11

qualify under his interpretation.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Liu, could

13

I just ask what you understand the Florida

14

cases to be saying?

15

elucidate that.

16

So I'll give you a hypo to

So I'm walking down the street and I'm

17

carrying a handbag with a strap over my

18

shoulder, and, as everybody knows, the way you

19

carry that is you essentially grab on to the

20

strap.

21

and wrests it out of my grasp.

22

So -- and then somebody comes and runs

23
24
25

Does that count under Florida law as
robbery?
MR. LIU:

It -- it depends.

I think

it would depend on a few more facts, but I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32

think -- I think the Florida cases do focus

2

just on this issue.

3

illustrate my answer with a couple of the

4

Florida cases.

And if I -- if I could

MR. LIU:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I want -- well,

Well, I -- I think the -­
-- but, I mean, I want

an answer to my hypothetical.

10

MR. LIU:

-- I think the facts you

11

described are not too different from the facts

12

of Rigell, and I think that is a case where the

13

Florida courts did conclude that the force used

14

was sufficient.

15

There, the -- the -- the victim had a

16

bag on his shoulder -- on her shoulder.

17

victim -- the defendant came around, yanked the

18

bag off.

19

the -- the victim turned and tried to resist in

20

that fashion.

There was a bit of a struggle because

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. LIU:

23

25

The

Yeah, so -­

And the purse -- the strap

of the purse -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- I was actually

taking that out, because, you know, I'm -- I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

-- I'm holding on to the bag, so you're going

2

to need some force to get it.

3

and that kind of force is used.

4

MR. LIU:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- and -­
Robbery?

Yes.
Okay.

Well, then

6

robbery in Florida really includes pretty much

7

the full gamut of bag snatchings.

8
9

MR. LIU:

I don't -- I don't think so.

And I'll give you a case that illustrates that.

10

A case called RP, which is cited in the

11

Robinson case -- that's sort of the seminal

12

case -- involves someone who grabbed a camera

13

that was hanging off someone's shoulder, and

14

that did not rise to the -- to the level of

15

force necessary for robbery.

16

And the difference between the two

17

cases is the added element of violence.

18

the resistance by the victim.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

It is

All I was

20

saying, I mean, I'm sure you can find me a

21

couple of cases where people walk around with

22

cameras or bags and -- and don't have their

23

hands on them.

24

woman who carries around handbags knows, that's

25

just the normal way you carry around a handbag.

But I'm going to say, as every

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

So -- so -- so that would be the usual

2

case, maybe not the always case, but it's the

3

usual case of bag snatching that you say falls

4

under the robbery definition.

5

MR. LIU:

And I think what's important

6

to remember about even that case is that there

7

is force on the one hand being applied by the

8

victim which is being met by force on the other

9

being applied by the defendant.

And what that

10

amounts to is a physical struggle over a piece

11

of property.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the problem is

--

14
15

I think it -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I mean -- I'm

sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

The

17

problem is, just in common parlance, the

18

definition that the courts have given in

19

Florida is the slightest resistance qualifies

20

as violent force so that if the victim just

21

merely moves you away and you push him back -­

22

MR. LIU:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

I don't think that's -­
-- that's the

slightest force.
MR. LIU:

Well, but I think what's -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

what's important to keep in mind -- I guess

2

this finishes my answer to Justice Kagan -- is

3

that what is inherent in the offense every time

4

it occurs in Florida is this violent contest

5

over a piece of property.

6

And I think it's natural to conceive

7

of the force necessary to prevail in such a

8

contest as force capable of causing -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's not the

10

words the Court has used.

11

slightest resistance and the slightest force

12

used to overcome it qualify as a robbery.

13

It said the

And under the categorical approach, I

14

thought that we had to eliminate something that

15

was slight.

16

MR. LIU:

Well, I think it's true that

17

what -- that the -- that the resistance can be

18

of any degree, but I think you have to view

19

that resistance -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

be of any degree?

MR. LIU:

So the force can

is -- is the context in which that interaction

2

that is a quintessentially -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I think

No, because what

4

you have is slight force over slight -- slight

5

resistance and slight force to overcome it.

6

MR. LIU:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Well, you're -- you're -­
How do you get

past that into that it's a tug of war?

9

I mean, some people grab you by your

10

arm and you just pull it away, and it doesn't

11

necessarily have to be a very forceful pulling

12

away.

13

MR. LIU:

Well, this -- this sort of

14

interaction where force is met by force has

15

been understood by the common law since

16

Blackstone as being violent.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we have to deal

18

with the Florida statute and how that -- how

19

the Florida court, Supreme Court, understands

20

the use, what -- what violent force is, what -­

21

what its own statute requires.

22

And the Florida Supreme Court has used

23

words like robbery can be committed with any

24

degree of force.

25

certainly can't be a substantial degree.

So any degree of force

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. LIU:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

2

think that quote comes from a case called

3

McCloud from 1976 -- I mean from 1972.

4

the -- the Florida Supreme Court in Robinson in

5

1997 said that that was merely dicta and, in

6

fact, pointed to one Florida intermediate court

7

case that had read that literally to mean any,

8

and expressly disapproved that holding.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The -­

Well, counsel, I'm

10

not sure that quite solves the problem, though,

11

because the statute on its face says not just

12

force or violence or assault, but it says "or

13

putting in fear."

14

constitute robbery in Florida.

That is sufficient to

15

MR. LIU:

Right.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And Robinson I'm not

17

sure helps you very much because I think it's

18

susceptible to a reading of saying, in the

19

cases of purse snatching where force is alleged

20

as the mode for creating a robbery, then you

21

need whatever -- whatever you've been talking

22

about with Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor.

23

But I don't read Robinson as

24

suggesting force is the only way of

25

establishing robbery under Florida or doing

anything to eliminate the disjunctive language

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Liu, could I ask

15

before you do that, you keep referring to the

16

common law, but I had thought that the whole

17

structure of the Curtis Johnson opinion is to

18

say, well, we have this common law definition,

19

but it's in the context of a statute which is

20

trying to identify violent felonies.

21

that particular context, Justice Scalia said

22

we're going to ignore the common law definition

23

and, instead, use an ordinary language

24

definition of what "force" is.

25

And in

And he basically says physical force

define violent felonies is violent force,

3

substantial force, and so forth.

4
5

So why -- why is this common law
argument relevant at all?

6

MR. LIU:

Well, I think it's relevant

7

for a number of reasons.

8

Johnson did reject a common law definition, but

9

the common law definition it rejected was one

10

First of all, Curtis

drawn from a misdemeanor offense.

11

Curtis Johnson didn't call into

12

question that a felony definition of force

13

might fit.

14

And this one does fit perfectly.

You're right that Johnson also

15

referenced the ordinary meaning of "force" in

16

terms -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

it.

19

was based on that.

It didn't reference

The whole argument -- the whole decision

20

MR. LIU:

And I -- and that's why I -­

21

I think I would return to what I was saying

22

earlier.

23

-- in every -- in everyday English and -- and

24

explained to them what happens in these cases,

25

where someone resists, that resistance is

I think if you took someone off the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

physically overpowered by someone else, I think

2

"violence" is actually the word a lot of people

3

would use.

4

It also is the word the common law has

5

used for centuries.

6

"violence" that's found in the statutes of

7

dozens of states.

8

Congress used when it enacted the basic robbery

9

definition in the '84 Act.

10

It's the -- it's the word

And it's the word that

It regarded this type of robbery,

11

Congress regarded this type of robbery, common

12

law robbery, as one of the most violent street

13

crimes -- one of the most common violent street

14

crimes that existed.

15

And so I think this ordinary approach,

16

this ordinary language approach to how we would

17

use violence in -- in ordinary English actually

18

cuts against -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the ordinary

20

English view is something like, look, when I'm

21

walking down the street and somebody puts a -­

22

a gun in the air and says give me your money,

23

that I know, I understand to be a violent

24

offense.

25

But, when I'm walking down the street

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

and somebody grabs my handbag, I'm not happy

2

about that, but it's -- it just doesn't have

3

that violent aspect of it in ordinary language

4

that I think, you know, beating somebody up

5

does, putting a gun in their face does.

6

And this is a -- a state that defines

7

robbery so broadly that you tell me it

8

basically includes every bag snatcher.

9

MR. LIU:

Well, I guess -- I guess

10

what I would say to that is whether -- whether

11

-- you know, what I would say is the key point

12

is what Congress thought, and I -- and I think

13

all the indications are that Congress regarded

14

this as violent.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what is the "this"

16

that Congress thought?

17

cases, we have to look to whether the state has

18

defined its crime more broadly than the basic

19

offense.

20

MR. LIU:

I mean, in all of these

Well, the idea that Florida

21

here is somehow an outlier among common law

22

jurisdictions is just not correct.

23

case law tracks exactly the sort of case law we

24

found in the common law treatises dating back

to Blackstone.

of the elements clause.

15

It wasn't -- it wasn't

We know that from both the text and

16

the history of the '84 Act and the '86 Act

17

because, starting with the text, Congress took

18

the very key element in its robbery definition,

19

force, and made that the centerpiece of the

20

elements clause.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but Curtis

22

Johnson says substantial degree of force, as

23

Justice Kagan points out, and how are we

24

supposed to deal with that language in the

25

Curtis Johnson opinion if we're trying to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

follow Curtis Johnson strictly?

2

MR. LIU:

Well, Justice Kavanaugh, the

3

force used -- the type of force involved in a

4

Florida robbery or any common law robbery is

5

substantial in two ways Curtis Johnson itself

6

found relevant.

7

The first is this kind of force is

8

force capable of causing physical pain or

9

injury.

That's what Curtis Johnson meant by

10

"substantial."

The two sentences, one follows

right after the other.

capable of causing physical pain and injury, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MR. LIU:

2

there's common ground here.

3

absolutely agree that whether something is

4

violent has to be evaluated in the context.

5

And a tap on the shoulder, I think, if -- if

6

you pulled someone off the street and said is a

7

tap on the shoulder without more violent, that

8

person would say no.

Well, we -- we -- it appears
We -- we

But, as I was saying, if you describe

10

to them the -- the situations that are inherent

11

in a Florida robbery offense, a physical

12

contest where two people are fighting over a

13

piece of property, that is quintessentially

14

violent and has been so -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

the word "fight."

the least resistance met by the least force.

20

That's not a fight in my dictionary.

21

But the statute just says

The fact that somebody has something

22

and pulls back and you just walk away with it,

23

that's not substantial force.

24
25

MR. LIU:

Oh, it -- it -- it is,

because whatever the resistance, the form the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

resistance that the victim is providing, is

2

being physically overpowered by the defendant.

3

And -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But how does that

5

define it as a substantial force?

Even as

6

capable of producing injury, if the example

7

that the Chief used, an elderly victim, just

8

simply can be overcome with no -- virtually no

9

force whatsoever?

10

MR. LIU:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't -- I don't -­
Then that's not

12

capable of causing injury, even in an elderly

person?

14

MR. LIU:

Again -- again, the force

15

shouldn't be measured in some quantitative

16

respect, like foot pounds or force meters.

17

Force does have to be evaluated in the context.

18

And so, yes, in some cases, the degree of

19

resistance may be small.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

MR. LIU:

Well, Congress thought so.

2

We know that because Congress adopted this very

3

definition of "robbery" in the '84 Act.

4

Robbery, common law robbery, was an original

5

ACCA predicate.

6

described these types of robberies as the most

7

common violent street crimes.

9
10

And in doing so, Congress

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why does burglary end

up as an enumerated crime and robbery does not
when Congress changed the Act?

11

MR. LIU:

Because it wasn't necessary

12

to enumerate robbery, given that Congress was

13

taking an element of robbery and making it the

14

basis of the elements clause.

15

By contrast, there was a lot more

16

doubt about whether the ACCA -- the new ACCA

17

without a specific reference to burglary would

18

have covered burglary.

19

that on pages 584 to 589 of Taylor.

20

a concern that burglary would be inadvertently

21

left out.

22

This Court recognized
There was

But there was -- there could be no

such concern with robbery because Congress did

the most straightforward thing it could do to

25

ensure that the new Act covered robbery, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

not just robbery but also things like rape and

murder.

What it did was it took that element,

thus guaranteeing that all the '84 covered

robberies would -- would come along with it,

6

and made that the basis such that other crimes

too -- rape, murder, et cetera -- would -­

robbery.

And the indications we have from the

text and the history are that Congress thought

the old ACCA was working perfectly well.

MR. LIU:

I say only the basic robbery

is knocked out, but I think that's the right

focus because we know from the '84 Act Congress

22

was concerned about keeping in basic robbery.

MR. LIU:

we don't have the exact number.

is because Petitioner is unwilling to commit to

whether some of those aggravated states

So the aggravated -- the aggravated

factor that Petitioner points to is an element

element.

quantification?

how much force is necessary.

So the -- the force that is required

15

the type of violence that has been regarded as

16

violent by the common law and, even more

17

relevant, Congress.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think the

I guess, Mr. Liu, the

19

problem I'm having in a nutshell is you keep on

20

referring to this as a physical struggle over

21

property, but at the same time, you tell me

22

that if somebody snatches a bag off my

23

shoulder, it's -- it counts as robbery -­

24

MR. LIU:

Well, I -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- under Florida law.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And, to me, that is not a physical

2

struggle over property.

3

its robbery statute that broadly so as to

4

include, you know, thefts of property but that

5

are not done with physical contestation,

6

physical struggle, then the state has made a

7

choice.

8
9

MR. LIU:

And if a state defines

And, Justice Kagan, I -- I

think we just disagree about what's covered by

10

state law then because I don't think a simple

11

purse snatching or pickpocketing -- those

12

things were the very reason -- was the very

13

reason for Robinson.

14

Robinson, the Florida Supreme Court

15

case, the very reason for it was to clarify

16

that those sorts of things are punished as

17

theft, as larceny, as sudden snatching -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I go back to what

19

your answers to my first questions were.

20

carrying my bag with my hand over the strap,

21

and you say when somebody wrests the bag from

22

me, that's -- that that's robbery.

23

MR. LIU:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

bag snatching in America, save a few.

MR. LIU:

Well, but I think only in a

2

case where there is actual victim resistance,

3

physical resistance to the taking.

4

where that's absent, like the AJ case discussed

5

in Robinson itself, that's not going to rise to

6

the level of a robbery.

7

prosecuted, if at all, only as a theft or a

8

larceny.

9

In a case

That's going to be

And so I think what the question

10

before this Court boils down to is whether it

11

should recognize a line between violent and

12

non-violent takings.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but,

14

counsel, can I -- I say one thing on Curtis

15

Johnson there, which is it says violent force.

16

And if I -- if it stopped there, I think you

17

might have an issue, but then it says "that is

18

force capable of causing physical pain or

19

injury to another person."

20

And "capable of" seems to me much

21

different from what we usually, as Justice

22

Kagan would say, think of as violent force.

23

So maybe -- maybe there's something in

24

Curtis Johnson itself, we've talked a lot about

25

it, but in that one sentence, it says "violent

force" and it says something else that seems

2

intention with violent force.

3
4

MR. LIU:

Mr. Chief Justice, may I

answer?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. LIU:

Certainly.

I think the capable language

7

is a gloss on violent.

8

ordinary English way of translating, of

9

spelling out what "violent" means.

10

I think it is an

And I think whether you look at

11

violent or the capable language, common law

12

robbery is -- satisfies that -- that -- that

13

definition.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA G. BRYN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MS. BRYN:

Thank you.

21

Your Honor, at common law, no physical

22

resistance was even required for robbery.

23

classic example from Blackstone is pulling a

24

watch chain and snapping a watch off of

25

someone.

The person doesn't have to do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1
2

anything.
So, under the government's view here,

3

that would constitute violent force, where

4

there wasn't even any -- it's a fiction if

5

resistance was implied in the watch chain at

6

common law.

7

broad, and that was the intent in '84.

8
9

Common law resistance was so

But let me just say Florida robbery
would not even need the 1984 definition because

10

Florida's expanded the temporal scope of

11

robbery far beyond the common law so that there

12

-- so Florida robbery today is essentially

13

shoplifting and pickpocketing, plus resisting

14

apprehension in some way.

15

Now to include these slight force

16

robberies as a predicate for a -- an

17

enhancement that would start at 15 years

18

imprisonment and authorize a penalty up to life

19

is really inconsistent with Congress's purpose

20

of identifying the worst of the worst

21

offenders, exactly those offenders who would be

22

likely not only to possess a gun but kill

23

someone with a gun.

24
25

And there is no predictive value from
using slight force to snap a bag or pull a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

dollar bill or even just pull one's arm away

2

from a security guard that would be predictive

3

of the willingness to use violent force.

4

If Congress finds that the result in

5

this case is counterintuitive, not what it

6

intended, and it really wants slight force

7

robberies to qualify as violent felonies

8

sufficient to support that enhancement, it's in

9

Congress's hands.

10

They can easily rewrite this statute.

11

There were two definitions originally.

12

robberies came within the residual clause for

13

many, many years.

14

question after the elimination of the residual

15

clause, and Congress has multiple resources -­

16

All

This has only become a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the residual

17

clause referred to "capable of causing" -- I'm

18

sorry -- "a serious risk of physical injury."

19

So how would common law robbery come within

20

that?

21

MS. BRYN:

It -- it -- it -- just by

22

the possibility of a confrontation afterwards,

23

which was the way -- which was the standard

24

this Court used for the residual clause crimes,

25

which swept in pickpocketing -­

just said?

applied, as the residual clause was applied,

15

because the language was so capacious and the

16

standard was unclear and it focused on a

17

hypothetical possible confrontation, one could

18

hypothesize a confrontation after

19

pickpocketings, after shopliftings, and,

20

ultimately, the residual clause swept in

21

everything.

22

I'm saying that, as

And that's why I believe it was

23

invalidated by this Court.

But now this Court

24

cannot compensate for the loss of the residual

25

clause by reading the elements clause beyond

its terms, and one very important term is "has
