the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Heim.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT HEIM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HEIM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In Janus Capital, this Court held that

12

only the maker of a misstatement can be held

13

liable for that misstatement under Section

14

10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b).

15

correctly held that Petitioner, Frank Lorenzo,

16

was not the maker of the statements that are at

17

issue in the two emails in this case.

18

The court below

However, the court below erred when it

19

held that Lorenzo could nevertheless be liable

20

for those very same misstatements under a

21

theory that, by producing and sending those

22

statements, he engaged in a deceptive act,

23

artifice to defraud, or practice, for purposes

24

of liability under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5(a)

25

and (c) and Section 17(a)(1).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

For three reasons Lorenzo's actions do
not support liability.

3

First, permitting liability under Rule

4

10b-5(a) and (c) and 17(a) would allow

5

plaintiffs to sidestep this Court's holding in

6

Janus and the limitations that were placed on

7

misstatement liability.

8

plaintiffs to creatively relabel their

9

inadequate misstatement claims as claims for

10

deceptive devices and acts.

11
12

And it would allow

The result is contrary to Janus and
would render Rule 10b-5(b) a nullity.

13

Second -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

was a private cause of action, correct?

Excuse me, Janus

Under 10b-5?

Yes, Your Honor, under

10b-5(b).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I understand

21

what Janus said, but I don't know how it

22

squares with 17(a).

23

And you swept 17(a) in.

10b-5 uses the phrase "to make" any

24

untrue statement.

But 17(a) says to obtain

25

money or property by means of any -- of any

untrue statement of a material fact.

That

seems dramatically different to me.

4

government can sue under 17(a).

5

be treating the two identically?

6

that anywhere in your brief you explain that.

17(a) is a

Why should we
I don't know

7

I know that we've had -- made general

8

statements that the two inform each other, but

9

certainly not on this critical point, because

10

Janus was based explicitly on the "making"

11

language of 10b-5(b).

12

MR. HEIM:

That's true, Your Honor.

13

The -- the subsection that you quoted is

14

actually from Section 17(a), subsection (2),

15

which is not -- was not charged by the SEC and

16

which Mr. Lorenzo was not accused of violating.

17

And we agree that subsection (2) may

18

be a better way for the SEC to proceed if

19

they're going to try to hold Petitioner liable

20

as a primary violator, because it -- it almost

21

fits very closely here because that's the

22

equivalent of Rule 10b-5(b).

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the same point can

24

be made, Mr. Heim, with respect to 10b-5(a) and

25

(c) and also with respect to 17(a)(1) and (3),

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

right?

That the idea is -- is, look, Janus was

2

a decision that -- it was a very textual

decision.

"make."

6

doesn't make statements.

Its -- it had lots of examples from

8

Its -- it interpreted the word

And neither (a) or (c) in 10b-5 has
the same language in it.

9

MR. HEIM:

Well, Justice Kagan,

10

10b-5(b) only addresses misstatements.

11

other categories in 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) are

12

really conduct-based language.

13

acts and -- and practices and courses of

14

business.

15

The

They get to

And our view is that (a) and (c) cover

16

quite a different type of fraud.

So you think that (a)

19

misrepresentations or omissions?

position?

21

MR. HEIM:

Is that your

We -- that is essentially

22

our position.

We don't dispute that there can

23

be cases where -- where you have both

24

misstatements and deceptive conduct.

difference between deceptive conduct and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So take this case.

5

Mr. Lorenzo here sent false financial

information to potential investors.

7

when he did that, he was the head of the

8

investment banking division.

9

false financial information.

14

sent that contains false financial information.

So he -- he

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm wondering,

just take -- I understand that argument, and

3

it's, I think, a serious argument.

4

But pretend that 10b-5(b) was not in

5

the statute for just a second, and you're

6

entitled to come back to it, but just pretend

7

it wasn't in the statute.

8

was charged here and that you've conceded was

9

done with an intent to deceive, is that

Is the behavior that

10

engaging in an act that would operate as a

11

fraud?

12

MR. HEIM:

No -- no, Your Honor, for a

13

couple of different reasons.

One, the Congress

14

has set up a statutory scheme for what

15

constitutes aiding and abetting liability, and

16

one of the key distinguishing features between

17

primary liability and aiding and abetting is

18

the concept of substantial assistance to a

19

primary violator.

20

In this case, Mr. Lorenzo just sent an

21

email at the direction of his boss with content

22

that was provided by his boss to the

23

recipients.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I tell you, all the

content -- I mean, the email begins with a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

summary.

It says the banking -- investment

2

banking division is summarizing key points of

3

the debenture offer.

4

that allegedly was cut and paste.

And then there's the part

5

But it starts out with a reference to

6

what the investment banking division is doing.

7

And it's signed by the head of -- head of that

8

division.

9

conveying what the boss told Lorenzo to send.

It -- so -- so it's not simply

10

The whole thing wasn't cut and paste, just a

11

portion of it.

12

Isn't that so?

MR. HEIM:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

13

court below found that there was sufficient

14

attribution in this email to Gregg Lorenzo

15

because it does start off by saying that it's

16

being sent at the request of Gregg Lorenzo.

17

And the record -- and the D.C.

18

Circuit, after looking at the Commission's

19

findings, found that Gregg -- Frank Lorenzo was

20

not the maker of the statements in the email.

21

And one of the reasons for that finding was

22

because it was attributed at the start of the

23

email to -- to Gregg Lorenzo.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Heim, if I

2

understand your position, it's irrespective of

3

that fact.

4

Mr. Lorenzo had made the email -- had -- had -­

5

had come up with the email himself.

6

In other words, suppose that

If I understand your position, you

7

would say, well, it's still not part of

8

10b-5(c) because that's a misrepresentation,

9

and misrepresentations can only be charged

10

under 10b-5(b).

11

I thought that that was what you just told me.

12

Isn't that what you would say?

MR. HEIM:

Well, no.

That's slightly

13

different than our hypothetical because the

14

question is really whether Rule 10b-5(b)

15

misstatements can be a part of other

16

subsections.

17

if Mr. Lorenzo had drafted the email, there's

18

certain other conduct, and our position is

19

that, in order to be held liable for 10b-5(a)

20

and (c), Mr. Lorenzo would have to have engaged

21

in something in addition to just mere

22

misstatements.

23

And in that particular instance,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did he make a

24

misstatement?

Did he personally make a

25

misstatement?

I think -- I thought your answer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1
2
3
4

was no, he did not make a misstatement.
MR. HEIM:

No, he didn't, and that was

what the D.C. Circuit found.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So then why

5

doesn't it fall within (c)?

6

that if it's a misstatement it can't fall

7

within anything other than (b) help you, when

8

you argue that he didn't make a misstatement,

9

he did something else?

10
11

Why does your rule

So why doesn't it fall

within (c)?
MR. HEIM:

Because Mr. Lorenzo didn't

12

engage in any additional deceptive conduct

13

other than making -- once he was deemed to be

14

not the maker of the statement, our view is,

15

consistent with the majority of circuits that

16

have considered this question, is that some

17

other inherent deceptive conduct would have to

18

be engaged in by Mr. Lorenzo.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, just take the

20

language of (c).

21

squarely within the language of (c)?

22

Why doesn't his conduct fall

MR. HEIM:

Well, because (c) talks

23

about conduct.

It's a type of fraud that's

24

categorically different than merely

25

misstatements or omissions.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you -- you say

2

(c) can't include any verbal conduct?

3

to be something else?

4

you're going to engage in a fraud without -­

5

without saying some words.

6

MR. HEIM:

It has

I don't quite know how

No, Your Honor, that's not

7

our position.

There can be cases where there's

8

both conduct and misstatements, which (c) would

9

cover.

10

Our position is, when you have a case

11

like this one, when there's only misstatements

12

and no deceptive conduct, that in order to

13

allow a plaintiff to repackage those claims as

14

claims under (a) and (c), would render 10b-5(b)

15

meaningless.

16

And, also, the D.C. Circuit set the

17

bar very low.

18

prepared by somebody else constitutes enough of

19

an action to constitute primary liability, it

20

would really leave no room for any sort of

21

aiding and abetting liability.

22

convert anybody that, perhaps, gives some sort

23

of substantial assistance to a primary

24

violator.

MR. HEIM:

It's

Well, there's an important

11

distinction to be drawn there because the

12

concept of primary liability really ties into

13

an active -- the statute and the regulation

14

discusses concepts of using and employing,

15

which implies a certain level of active

16

conduct.

17

Here, in this case, we have two emails

18

that were sent moments apart, and the content

19

was essentially prepared by his boss, Gregg

20

Lorenzo.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'd like to go back

22

to my question on that point.

I'm looking at

23

the Petitioner's Appendix 107.

24

of the two emails.

25

that's underlined, and I thought that that is

MR. HEIM:

Well, no, Your Honor.

The

7

-- the record in the holding below was that the

8

email as a whole came from the boss, Gregg

Lorenzo, not from Petitioner, and that the

10

Petitioner, Frank Lorenzo, was instructed by

Gregg Lorenzo to send the email out to clients

which I think you did, that you're not

intent to deceive or defraud, that you aren't

that effect?

and he has the act of putting together the

2

email and encouraging customers to call him

3

with questions, not to call his boss with

4

questions, how could that standing alone give

5

away your case?

6

MR. HEIM:

Well, Your Honor -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, that -­

8

that makes him both the maker of a false

9

statement, whether his boss shared it or not,

10

and I know the courts below thought

11

differently, but it's also engaging in an act,

12

practice, or course of conduct which operates

13

or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any

14

person.

15

Whether he was a maker or not, he was

16

encouraging the customers to call him directly

17

about buying or -- buying what was being

18

offered.

19

MR. HEIM:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

20

think you're tying into what our position is

21

with respect to what more would be necessary to

22

convert over Mr. Lorenzo into a primary

23

violator, because, if those customers had, in

24

fact, called Frank Lorenzo, which they didn't,

25

and he would then have repeated the statements

Heritage Reporting Corporation

or he would have engaged in some other type of

2

deceptive conduct, but merely producing and

3

sending the emails is such a low bar that the

D.C. Circuit said for -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Heim, we've

6

made very clear in Central Bank that this idea

7

of primary and secondary, if your actions fit

8

within the language of the particular provision

9

of the statute that you're charged on, then

10

you're a primary violator of that provision.

11

Right?

12

And even if, given some other

13

language, you wouldn't be, or given, you know,

14

some more common -- you know, some -- some

15

other understanding of what it means, if you

16

fit within the language and you violate that

17

language, you're a primary violator.

18

what we said in Central Bank.

19

That's

And I guess the import of these

20

questions is he fit within that language.

21

engaged in an act that operated as a fraud.

22

MR. HEIM:

He

Well, Justice Kagan, our

23

view is that you can't take that language in -­

24

in a vacuum.

25

context of the statutory framework that

You have to consider it in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

Congress has put into place for aiding and

2

abetting liability because, if you were to find

3

that Frank Lorenzo engaged in a primary

4

violation here, it would undermine Congress's

5

statutory intent for setting up in Section -­

6

Section 20 of the Exchange Act exactly who is

7

an aider and abetter.

8

is somebody who provides substantial

9

assistance.

And the key distinction

10

Perhaps here the SEC -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, because -- that

12

is useful because there are some people who

13

don't fall within the language of the statute

14

and, nonetheless, can be charged as an aider

15

and abetter under Section 20, if the SEC does

16

it, if it's not a private action.

17

But what we said in Central Bank is,

18

look, if you do the thing that's -- that is

19

described in a particular subsection of this

20

statute or of the -- or of 10b-5, the rule that

21

implements it, then you're a primary violator

22

as to that subsection.

23

MR. HEIM:

Our view is that Mr.

24

Lorenzo did not engage in conduct sufficient to

25

form a violation of 10b-5(c), for instance.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

When -- when you look at the case law, it has a

2

much higher standard for what constitutes

3

violations of those provisions.

4

So, in order for Mr. Lorenzo to have

5

become a primary violator, he would have had to

6

engage in more active misconduct.

7

instance, would have set up a phony purchase

8

order to substantiate one of the points of the

9

email, if he were to go onto the Internet and

If he, for

10

produce content under phony aliases, these are

11

all -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, those would have

13

been bad too, but I guess I just don't get why

14

the act that he did engage in is not an act

15

that operates as a fraud?

16

MR. HEIM:

Well, for two reasons, Your

17

Honor.

One, sending the email does not rise to

18

the level of using or employing a fraudulent

19

device under our view.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And number two -­
Well, that's -- you're

21

quoting me (a) and I was using the language of

22

(c), although, honestly, one could just as well

23

use the language of (a) because we've said that

24

a -- a fraudulent device is just a scheme to

25

defraud.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

MR. HEIM:

Well, Your Honor, it -- it

2

has a certain level of -- of intentionality

3

behind it in terms of Mr. Lorenzo.

4

an email in and of itself would not, in our

5

view, raise -- rise to the level of employing

6

or using a deceptive device.

7

So sending

And, you know, an additional related

8

point to that is that this Court's holdings in

9

Central Bank, Santa Fe, and other cases confine

10

Rule 10b-5(b) to the boundaries of Section

11

10(b).

12

go beyond the boundaries of Section 10(b) in

13

terms of proscribing fraudulent conduct.

14

So, in other words, Rule 10b-5 cannot

And that line of cases says, in order

15

for conduct to be fraudulent, it has to be

16

either deceptive or manipulative.

17

Chiarella case stands for the proposition that,

18

unless there's a misstatement or an omission or

19

some sort of manipulative trading, that those

20

are essentially the three categories of fraud

21

that are proscribed by Section 10(b).

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the

I have to say I think

23

that that works against you, that principle,

24

because, you're right, that all of 10b-5 is

25

coming off of 10(b), which refers only to

manipulative or deceptive devices or

2

contrivances, but it's well understood that

3

misrepresentations or omissions are

4

manipulative or deceptive devices or

5

contrivances, and just those misrepresentations

6

alone.

7

I mean, if -- if some of your

8

arguments were correct, if you took them to

9

their logical extent, you would have to say

10

that misrepresentations and omissions don't

11

fall within that language of 10(b).

12

MR. HEIM:

Well, Justice Kagan, that's

13

when you get into the importance of the Janus

14

decision because, once Frank Lorenzo is

15

determined not to be the maker of those

16

misstatements, in our view, it takes him out of

17

the category of misstatements and -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I understand, but your

19

argument would also take out the makers of

20

those misstatements.

21

MR. HEIM:

Not necessarily because the

22

makers of the misstatements would have primary

23

liability.

24

And it's not one of the issues that -- that's

25

at issue.

We're not contesting that here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

Our view is that, once Mr. Lorenzo is

2

deemed not to be the maker of the misstatement,

3

the Court then would look to see, well, is

4

there an omission, which there isn't here.

5

there manipulative trading being done?

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is

Well, but I

7

thought -- I thought you said just a short

8

while ago that simply sending an email is -- is

9

-- is not enough.

10

MR. HEIM:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then you -­

12

your distinction depends solely on the content

13

of the email?

14

down to the basic question of whether or not

15

Frank Lorenzo was involved at all in the

16

drafting?

17

In other words, it's -- it gets

So, for you -- for you to prevail, we

18

have to understand him as -- as, I guess he

19

argued at one point, not even reading the

20

email?

21

MR. HEIM:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

That -- I don't think, in order for us to

23

prevail, you have to make that finding.

24
25

Our position is that the Court should
establish the test that Mr. Lorenzo's conduct

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

has to be something that's inherently

2

deceptive, and that would be sufficient to push

3

him over the line from being somebody who is

4

not the maker of the misstatement but could

5

still somehow be held liable under Rules

6

10b-5(a) and (c).

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why wasn't it -- I

8

mean, I -- I thought he sent his email around

9

to people and said this company, which he knew

10

was worthless from their filing, has $10

11

million in assets, which he knew wasn't true,

12

and also had $43 million other to -- to back it

13

up, which he knew wasn't true, and his defense

14

was, well, I only sent it because my boss told

15

me, his -- the other Lorenzo.

16

And so, fine, then he's not the maker.

17

But it seems pretty bad.

18

working with this company for quite a long time

19

and these investors.

20

makes this just aiding and abetting?

21

didn't make the statement, but he was sure a

22

big deal participant.

23

MR. HEIM:

I mean, he'd been

And so what is it that
Maybe he

Yes, Justice Breyer.

And

24

-- and to be clear, Mr. Lorenzo acknowledged in

25

the record at the trial that he made a mistake.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

23

And under our position, Mr. Lorenzo would not

2

get off scot-free.

3

remedies against aiders and abetters, as well

4

as, as referenced before, Section 17(a)(2),

5

which is not at issue here, would seem to

6

perhaps fit much better because it's a -- it's

7

a subsection that deals with obtaining money or

8

property under false statements.

9

There's very stringent

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- that's what

13

I'm having trouble with.

Whether 17(a)(2) was

14

charged or not is irrelevant, because the way

15

17(a) is structured, it's not controlled by

16

Janus at all.

17

MR. HEIM:

Well -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because it doesn't

19

talk about making statements.

It talks about

20

obtaining money or property by statements.

21

There's no reason why we should limit, under

MR. HEIM:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

to understand what the statute is about.

different view of the statute, which -- which

statute, where it's like we're going to find

10

every possible way to say this thing in order

11

to make sure that fraudulent acts are covered.

12

MR. HEIM:

Well, Justice Kagan, we

13

don't dispute that there could be some overlap

14

between the different subsections.

15

in order to sustain the D.C. Circuit, it would

16

really be a wholesale elimination of one of the

17

subsections, which is Rule 10b-5(b).

18

But here,

And that would be contrary to the -­

19

to the holding of Corley versus United States,

20

where the Court is -- is -- the purpose is to

21

find meaning for each of the different

22

subsections and not read it in a way that would

23

make one of them redundant.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then I'm going to

ask you again, what's the difference in meaning

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1
2

between (a) and (c)?
MR. HEIM:

Well, the -- they both deal

3

with conduct.

And I don't know if there is a

4

real meaningful difference between (a) and (c)

5

because they both have very similar language

6

between the two.

7

as -- as the lower courts have, they can

8

consider (a) and (c) as one type of fraud,

9

which is conduct-based because the conduct -­

But I think the Court can -­

10

the language is very similar, the plain

11

language of (a) and (c).

12

in the majority opinions that we cite, do treat

13

(a) and (c) as very similar on one hand and

14

then (b) as distinct.

15

And the courts below,

And the majority position is -- is

16

that plaintiffs should not just be allowed to

17

repackage inadequate 10b-5(b) claims, which are

18

just the misstatement claims, and say that

19

those misstatements, standing alone, can

20

somehow be enough to satisfy the language of

21

(a) and (c), which is a conduct-based fraud.

22

And if the Court was to uphold that

23

view, it would render 10b-5(b) meaningless and

24

I think also, by implication, Section 17(a)(2),

25

which 10b-5(b) was drawn on.

So there's a lot

of problems with sustaining the court's opinion

2

below with regards to that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

some basic questions?

MR. HEIM:

there is inconsistencies in the record, but,

MR. MICHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

that grossly misrepresented the financial

I'm sorry.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It sounds like

5

the argument your -- your client made in Janus

6

that was rejected by this Court.

7

MR. MICHEL:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

in Janus, the provision at issue was 10b-5(b).

9

And the government is no longer pressing a

10

10b-5(b) charge in this case.

11

The -- the Janus opinion, from start

12

to finish, is very clear that it's interpreting

13

the term "make" in Rule 10b-5.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the essential

15

argument on the other side is that the argument

16

you're now pressing is just an end run about

17

Janus.

18

inconsequential.

19

would have been a 10b charge under 17 or

20

10b-5(a) and (c).

21
22
23

It would render Janus essentially
All you do is repackage what

MR. MICHEL:

Well, Your Honor, a

couple of points in response to that.
First of all, Janus will still have

24

significant meaning, especially in private

25

actions, because Janus limits the number -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

limits who can come within 10b-5(b).

2

Janus opinion was careful to -- to distinguish

3

between aiders and abetters who are sort of

4

background actors, the speech writer example is

5

the one that the Court gave, preparatory actors

6

who aren't themselves employing a device under

7

(a) or engaging in an act under (c) but are

8

instead merely supporting that.

9

And the

So our contention is not that everyone

10

who has some involvement in a statement will

11

somehow become primarily liable under (a) and

12

(c) and Section 17(a).

13

Central Bank was very clear that the test for

14

primary liability is simply that the defendant

15

has to satisfy all the elements of the statute.

16

And in -- and Central Bank says expressly that

17

even if somebody is a secondary actor in some

18

colloquial sense, like a lawyer or an

19

accountant, that person can still be primarily

20

liable under the securities laws if that person

21

satisfies all of the statutory requirements, as

22

Petitioner did here and as I don't take him to

23

seriously contest.

24
25

As Justice Kagan said,

His argument seems to be that
subsection (b) of 10b-5 has some sort of field

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32

preemptive effect in that it serves as the sole

2

vehicle for bringing claims -- securities fraud

3

claims involving statements.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, that's not

7

this, and it proceeds in about five or six

8

steps, I think.

9

And as I

10

look at the statute.

11

let's look at the statute.

deceptive devices essentially.

6

7

We can get

Okay, fine.
When we get to actus reus, no omission

12

is alleged, just an action.

13

could have an actus reus of fraud by act or

14

omission, only act's charged here.

15

only act seems to be this statement issued to

16

potential investors, and we have a finding from

17

the D.C. Circuit that it wasn't made, that act

18

wasn't made, that statement wasn't made by this

19

defendant.

20

You could -- you

And the

Now we could maybe overturn that, I

21

suppose, and you could argue that.

But, if you

22

didn't make the act a fraud that's alleged,

23

then doesn't that necessarily imply he

24

substantially assisted if anything?

25

that's the argument.

I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. MICHEL:

So I think it was maybe

2

around step four that I disagreed with you, and

3

that is I think you said that he didn't make

the act.

5

distinguish, to your point on the text of the

6

statute and the rule, what the D.C. Circuit

7

found was that he didn't make the statement,

8

and, therefore, he didn't fall within the text

9

of 10b-5(b).

10

But I do think it's important to

11

fraud, you have to have an act that deceives

someone else.

challenging that?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. MICHEL:

Okay.

-- but the transmission

8

of -- the statement in the abstract, you know,

9

does -- does nothing.

10

It was the transmission

of the email, which is an act.

11

I think, if you look at the ordinary

12

meaning of "act," it would include sending an

13

email or the ordinary meaning of the verb

14

"employ" in 10b-5(a).

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But the act -- the

16

relevant act for fraud, again, though, is the

17

act of deceiving another.

3

don't know if it was -- it wasn't likely you

7

position.

You
I

No, that's not the SG
It's not the Commission's

It wasn't charged in this case,

10

you're right, Your Honor, but we would not say

11

that it controls.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. MICHEL:

Do you know why?

I don't actually know

14

exactly why (a)(2) wasn't -- 17(a)(2) wasn't

15

charged in this case, but the reason we

16

wouldn't take that position is that the verb

17

"make" is not in 17(a)(2), and that is

18

critically the word that the Court was

19

interpreting in Janus.

20

I -- on that point, I do want to make

21

clear that Janus was self-consciously a

22

decision only about 10b-5(b).

23

the second question in the oral argument in

24

that case from Justice Sotomayor was why isn't

25

there an (a) claim, a scheme claim in this

I think it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

his clients wouldn't have been liable under

3

that theory.

4

arisen in the case.

5

And petitioner's response was not that

It was that that simply hadn't

So Janus was clearly just deciding the

6

meaning of (b), which I do think goes to the

7

real flaw in Petitioner's argument, which is,

8

again, that subsection (b) somehow restricts

9

the meaning of (a) and (c) in Rule 10b-5 and

10

also somehow restricts the meaning of

11

subsection (a) of a completely different

12

statute, the Securities Act of 1933.

13

And I do think it's a quite

14

extraordinary argument to say that the

15

Commission could, by adopting a rule in 1942,

16

change the meaning of a statute that was

17

enacted by the Congress and signed by the

18

President in 1933.

19

In fact, you know, this Court has

20

repeatedly rejected that kind of field

21

preemption or exclusive remedy argument in the

22

securities laws, most prominently in the

23

Affiliated Ute case, where the Court says quite

24

literally even though petitioner is not -- or

25

the securities seller in that case is not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

liable under (b), he is liable under (a) and

2

(c) because those provisions are not so

3

restricted.

4

Another good example is the Herman and

5

MacLean case that we cite in our brief.

6

petitioner was -- the defendant was found

7

liable under Rule 10b-5 for misstatements or

8

omissions in a registration statement, even

9

though Section 11 of the Securities Act

10

applies expressly to misstatements in

11

registration statements.

There,

12

And the Court in a quite extended

13

discussion said we're not going to apply a

14

theory of displacement.

15

apply a theory of exclusive remedies.

16

We're not going to

In fact, both of the two statutes, the

17

Securities Act and the Exchange Act, have

18

clauses that say they're not the exclusive

19

remedies for securities laws.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What does "fraud"

21

mean, other than trying -- doing something

22

to -- to create in the mind of the hearer or

23

recipient a false belief that is material?

24
25

MR. MICHEL:

I -- I think that's a

good -- I think that's a good description of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

it.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:
Law Dictionary.

Well, that's Black's

It's good enough.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, fine.

If that's what it is,

6

if that's what it is, there could be two ways

7

of doing it.

8

yourself.

9

someone else makes the statement, but you play

10

One, you make the statement

Two, you're part of a group where

a pretty important role.

11

Indeed, you might be the boss of the

12

group, in which case you're not an aider or

13

abetter.

14

do, in fact, give rise to, perhaps as the boss,

15

the false misrepresentation, wouldn't that be

16

covered by (a) and (c)?

So, if you're not the maker, but you

17

MR. MICHEL:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Yes.
Okay.

I know that's

your position.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. MICHEL:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
But I just wondered

23

why this isn't fairly simple, because now what

24

we did in Janus is we took a category of things

25

which we thought the maker had made the false

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

representation, and we thought, no, he wasn't

2

the maker, but, still, he might be the big boss

3

of a group of people who, in fact, took actions

4

or made statements to cause the false

5

representation to arise in the mind of the

6

listener.

7
8

MR. MICHEL:

I -- I do.

I do agree.

I do agree, Justice Breyer.

9
10

I thought perhaps you would agree.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that, it seemed

to me, is your basic argument.

11

MR. MICHEL:

That's correct.

And, you

12

know, we recognize there was a close decision

13

in Janus, but I think Janus is ultimately a

14

helpful decision for the Commission.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was thinking about

16

it that way, but I dissented in Janus.

17

I don't want to be -­

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. MICHEL:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

-- I don't want to be

--

21

23

And so

Well, I actually think -­
I don't want it to be

oversimplified.
MR. MICHEL:

Right.

No, I think, you

know, one quite simple explanation for Janus is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

that the Court simply followed the text of the

2

rule, and that's precisely -- and there was

3

dispute about it, but everybody agreed that you

4

were going to interpret the text of the rule.

5

And we believe, if you interpret the

6

text of the rule here, it is quite clear, and

7

-- and Petitioner is almost conceding, I think,

8

that his conduct falls within the meaning of

9

(a) and (c).

10

It's only this argument that (b)

11

somehow restricts or supersedes or preempts a

12

charge under (a) and (c) of Rule 10(b).

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no, the

14

argument is if you read (a) and (c) the way you

15

do, Janus is a dead letter, right?

16

-- in the reply brief, the Petitioner says you

17

never suggest any situation to which Janus

18

would apply, if your reading of 10b-5 prevails.

19

MR. MICHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, that

20

-- we disagree with that.

21

somebody -­

22
23
24
25

I mean, in

I mean, if you had

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's

hear if you -- go ahead.
MR. MICHEL:

Well, perhaps we didn't

suggest it in -- in our brief, but, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

if you had somebody who was far back in the

2

chain of drafting copy, you know, for example,

3

a marketing director who drafted copy that was

4

itself not deceptive but that that person knew

5

would then be used in a fraud or you had a

6

speech writer who drafted something that was

7

not wrong but he knew was later going to be

8

used in a fraud, that person in our view would

9

be an aider and abetter.

10

That would not be a primary violation,

11

for the important reason that Rule 10b -- that

12

Section 10(b) itself requires a deceptive act.

13

And simply submitting material that

14

you know is later going to be used fraudulently

15

would give you the -- the requisite mens rea

16

for substantial assistance but not for a

17

violation of 10b-5(b) itself.

18

And Janus will be the critical case in

19

those scenarios between primary liability and

20

secondary liability.

21

essential in a private action because there is

22

no cause of action after Central Bank for

23

aiding and abetting in a private action.

24
25

And that's, of course,

And Janus will be the difference
between liability and no liability for people

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1
2

in that situation.

Now I do -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think the Chief

3

Justice is thinking of someone who does -­

4

prior to Janus, would have made a statement,

5

and now that seemed to be excluded in Janus.

6

MR. MICHEL:

So the -- I mean -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and now we

8

have a way of making, for that set of people,

9

Janus irrelevant because the aiding and

10

abetting argument you just made would have

11

existed pre-Janus or ante-Janus.

12

One possible attitude is to say:

13

much the better.

14

dissenters' attitude.

So

But that perhaps would be the

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so -- so -- so

17

-- so what is the answer to the Chief Justice's

18

question, which was raised by your opponents,

19

that it still has life and, in fact, makes a

20

difference even for people who before and

21

after, maybe in the private context, what is -­

22

what is -­

23

MR. MICHEL:

May -- well, let me try

24

to be clear.

Before Janus, there would have

25

been an argument that somebody far back in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

chain of -- of making a statement was a maker

2

of the statement under -- and was primarily

3

liable under 10b-5(b).

4

have been a private action against that

5

defendant.

6

That means there could

After Janus, that argument is no

7

longer available with respect to people far

8

back in the chain who didn't commit one of the

9

-- who don't fall within (a) or (c) as primary

10

violators.

11

Now we think that's not this case

12

because Petitioner does fall within (a) and

13

(c).

14

But -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your -- so the

15

SEC would argue that somebody that prepared one

16

of these documents that's -- contains

17

fraudulent material or -- or knew that it would

18

be used in a fraud, in other words, you would

19

say, oh, don't worry about that, that person's

20

not a maker, he's not going to be liable

21

because of Janus?

22

MR. MICHEL:

Before Janus, we would

23

have said he was a maker.

But we accept Janus.

24

And now we would say that that person is an

25

aider and abetter who could be pursued by the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

Commission.

2

decision that we've cited in -- in our brief.

3

Now I do want to make the point that

4

aiding and abetting liability will not always

5

be available.

6

that's always a fallback for the Commission.

7

First of all, of course, it's not available at

8

all in a private right of action, which is one

9

of the principal ways in which victims of fraud

10

That's -- that's the Malouf

And so it's tempting to say that

can recover money.

11

But it's also not available even in a

12

Commission action unless there's a primary

13

violation.

14

violator.

15

typical criminal aiding and abetting under 18

16

U.S.C. 2.

17

You have to find the primary
And that distinguishes this from

So you can easily hypothesize a

18

situation in which somebody who makes the

19

statement, perhaps a high-up corporate

20

executive or a board of directors, lacks the

21

scienter required for primary liability because

22

they don't know what's going on with the

23

details of the financial reports; they're

24

trusting the lower-down people to do that.

25

And the Commission can't pursue them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

for a primary violation because they lack

2

scienter.

3

the aider and abetter because there's no

4

primary violator.

5

And then the Commission can't pursue

And that would, we submit, tear a big

6

loophole in securities fraud law, and that

7

would be a very damaging result for the

8

Commission that I don't think Congress intended

9

and that I don't think is within the ordinary

10
11

meaning of the text here.
My -- my friend said a couple of times

12

that -- tried to draw a distinction between

13

conduct and statements.

14

the questioning suggests, I just don't think

15

that holds up.

16

opinion expressly says that the petitioner's

17

course of conduct included both oral and

18

written statements.

19

clear that conduct can include statements.

20
21
22

And -- and as some of

To start with, the Stoneridge

So this Court has made

And -- and in addition, Section 10(b)
itself, which -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think he was saying

23

something to the effect of, if it's only

24

statements, it can't be conduct.

25

MR. MICHEL:

Yeah, I -- I don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

that can work either.

2

you, Justice Kagan, who suggested this.

3

friend said, everything in 10b-5 has to come -­

4

has to emanate from 10(b).

5

nouns that are at issue in 10(b) are "devices"

6

and "contrivances."

7

And I -- I think it was
As my

And the only two

Now Section 10(a) includes "device" -­

8

or Rule 10b-5(a) includes "devices," which I

9

take him to -- to concede is conduct.

So,

10

unless his position is that all statements are

11

contrivances and covered by 10(b) for that

12

reason, I think he's conceded -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

MR. MICHEL:

15

devices under 10(b).

16

Well, counsel -­

-- that statements are

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- I think what I'm

17

-- what I heard at any rate -- and we can -­

18

it's an interesting question what the argument

19

is, but I had understood it that, all right,

20

one can create a false impression in the mind

21

of another through conduct or through

22

statements.

23

All right?

Here, the only thing that was alleged

24

to create a false impression in the mind of

25

others was this statement and that that's the

If the only false act, the

But he didn't engage in any

"other than" is quite important.

to on anybody's account, but we're trying to

22

draw a line here between primary and secondary.

23

And that's -- that's where I'm stuck.

24
25

And -- and you -- you've -- you've

MR. MICHEL:

Well, on the facts of

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You've made the

point, but you -- you concede we've got bigger

10

MR. MICHEL:

Right.

I -- I agree with

11

that and I -- I do think you'll see sort of

12

higher stakes and more sophisticated frauds,

but I don't think you're likely to see a sort

of more egregious fraud than this, where

You've got lots of
And -- but -­

Those are acts.
Oh, those are acts.

But, if the act that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

created the deception in the mind of another

wasn't any conduct, it was a statement, then

3

what, is the question?

4
5
6
7
8
9

MR. MICHEL:

I suppose the answer to

that is that sending an email is conduct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, it took acts to

get to those minds, right?
MR. MICHEL:

Absolutely, and the act

it took in particular was sending the email,

10

sending the two emails, without which these

11

investors never would have been deceived.

12

I do very strongly think that the act was what

13

led to the deception.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -­

It helped the

15

deception, but the deceptive -- the thing that

16

caused the deception in the mind of the other,

17

to get back to Justice Breyer's quotation from

18

Black's, was the statement in the email, the -­

19

the erroneous facts transmitted to investors in

20

the email, right?

21
22
23

That's it?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's not -­

No, it can't cause the

deception unless it gets to those readers.
MR. MICHEL:

I -- I agree with that.

24

I mean, I suppose another way to think of it is

25

if Petitioner had -- if Petitioner had called

up the investors on the phone and said, you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you said

-- when you said -- just to clarify, when you

11

said, "I agree with that," were you agreeing

with Justice Gorsuch or Justice Kagan?

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. MICHEL:

15

I think it was Justice

Kagan.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

distinction between conduct and statement?

MR. MICHEL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Okay.

Okay.

No.

state?

MR. MICHEL:

25

(Laughter.)

Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

You know, I mean,

2

don't we make statements all the time through

3

conduct?

4

MR. MICHEL:

Yes, of course.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

I -­

6

since it was a favorable question, I thought

7

you might be -­

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. MICHEL:

And, you know, I -- I

10

think it runs in both directions.

11

Court has said -- you know, in --- in criminal

12

law cases, the Court has said that not every

13

crime that, you know, involves some sort of

14

speech, you know, necessarily raises a First

15

Amendment concern.

16

well grounded principle that conduct does

17

include statements.

18

The -- the

I think it's a -- it's a

I -- I suppose a final point, as we're

19

sort of searching for meaning for (b), I do

20

think the Court has, you know, reiterated on

21

many occasions that even a provision that seems

22

redundant or that doesn't add anything to the

23

substantive scope of the law can still serve a

24

valuable purpose by clarifying or by -- by

25

marking out what the heartland of the -- of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

violation is.

2

And here, if you look at the history

3

of the securities laws, Rule 10b-5 came about

4

nine years after the Securities Act, which had

5

changed the common-law rule and brought

6

disclosure and statements to the fore as a -­

7

as a responsibility for those issuing and

8

trading in securities.

9

So it makes sense that Rule 10b-5(b)

10

would -- would mark out statements as a

11

particular area of concern and would say, if

12

you can show that somebody made a statement,

13

then you've shown liability under 10b-5.

14

But I don't think that that in any way

15

forecloses liability under (a) and (c).

16

I said earlier, the Affiliated Ute case, I

17

think, is -- is squarely on point and says

18

somebody can be liable under (a) and (c) even

19

if they're not liable under (b).

20

And as

Justice Alito's opinion, which we

21

cited at page 36 of our brief, in the Lee case

22

from the Third Circuit, I think is helpful on

23

this point too.

24

statute that covered both crimes of deceit on

25

the one hand and tax evasion on the other hand.

In that case, there was a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

And Justice Alito's opinion explained

2

that a tax crime that was not evasion but still

3

involved deceit would be covered by that

4

statute because the enumeration of tax evasion

5

didn't preempt the field or didn't serve as the

6

exclusive vehicle for all tax-related claims.

7

And I think the same analysis applies here.

8
9

The statement -- the enumeration of
statements in Rule 10b-5(b) does not preempt or

10

foreclose acts of conduct that fall within the

11

text of the statute.

12
13

If there are no further questions,
we'd ask the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT HEIM

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. HEIM:

Thank you.

20

My friend argues that their plain

language of the rule and the statute covers Mr.

22

Lorenzo's conduct.

23

SEC has submitted, they haven't cited any cases

24

that cover simply sending an email out on

2

Secondly, the loophole hypothetical

3

that was discussed as well, and the concerns

4

about hindering the SEC's enforcement program,

5

are really unfounded here because the SEC, in

6

addition to having aiding and abetting

7

liability, also has 17(a)(2), which covers

8

specifically a situation where a person uses a

9

false statement to obtain money or property.

10

So that, the 17(a)(2), it's our

11

position, covers the concerns that the Court

12

raised in situations where perhaps there's a

13

big boss that's -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying -­

15

saying 17(a)(2) covers this case?

16

saying that Lorenzo used this statement to

17

obtain money or property?

18

MR. HEIM:

Are you

No, I think if that -- if

19

that had been charged, Mr. Lorenzo would have

20

arguments and defenses to 17(a)(2), but the

21

charge would have been a closer fit to what the

22

conduct is here and it would not have raised

23

the serious issues with regards to undermining

24

Congress's statutory framework with regards to

25

aiding and abet -- aiding and abetting and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

requirement to have substantial assistance,

2

because, as Justice Gorsuch noted, Mr. Lorenzo

3

did not engage in an inherently deceptive act.

4

Sending an email is not inherently deceptive.

5

And our position, consistent with the
