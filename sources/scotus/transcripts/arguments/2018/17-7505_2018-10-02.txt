ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

11

It's undisputed that Vernon Madison

12

now sits on Alabama's death row, unable to

13

fully orient to time and place.

14

several strokes, he suffers from acute vascular

15

dementia, which has left his cognitive

16

abilities greatly diminished.

17

intellectual functioning in the borderline

18

range.

19

severe disabilities have rendered him

20

bewildered and confused most of the time.

Mr. Stevenson,

22

I'm -- it's a question for both sides, but I'm

23

having trouble with a firm grasp on exactly

24

what issues are presented.

25

Now just tell me if I've got this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

right:

2

say, is, does someone who doesn't remember the

3

details of their crime, can he satisfy Ford and

4

Panetti simply on that basis?

5

capital punishment is, he knows what's going to

6

happen; he just doesn't remember what -- what

7

he did.

There are two.

The first one, I would

standard, but it's not caused by insanity; it's

12

right that those are the two separate

14

questions?

In other words, he meets the Ford

MR. STEVENSON:

Now am I

I -- I -- I think

16

they're two related questions.

And the only -­

17

I think what we would argue is that that first

18

question is that, yes, memory loss, with some

19

-- something else can render someone

20

incompetent, and that something else may not be

21

dementia -- that is, someone who has a brain

22

injury and is now impaired in a way where they

23

have no memory of anything, it's not vascular

24

dementia -- could also be incompetent to be

25

executed, someone who is actually in a coma.

Did you say must be

And what would the plus be?

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, the -- the

5

examples that come to mind would be the kind of

6

brain damage that is a result of an injury,

7

where the brain is injured and incapable of

8

actually producing memories or creating the

9

kind of rational understanding that this Court

10
11

has required.
A second example would be something

12

like a coma.

13

is in a coma is not competent to be executed

14

because their state of mind would not be

15

reconcilable to what this Court has held in

16

Ford and Panetti.

17

We would argue that someone who

Mr. Stevenson,

18

part of the problem is the use of the word

19

"loss of memory."

20

seem to go back and forth on this.

And I -- in your briefs, you

21

Are you conceding that amnesia about

22

the incident alone, where you can function in

23

every other way in society, would you be

24

incompetent then?

Justice Sotomayor's question.

2

if -- if a person simply is without memory of

3

his commission of the capital offense, does

4

that in itself render that person incompetent

5

to be executed?

6

MR. STEVENSON:

If a person -­

I -- I think it could.

7

But I think the reason why I qualify it is

8

because there aren't circumstances that I

9

believe are consistent with what we've argued

10

here.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I think that's a

12

-- a question that calls for a yes or no

13

answer.

14

memory of the commission of the capital

15

offense, does that in itself render the person

16

incompetent to be executed?

If the only thing that is lacking is

I think it would

18

render someone incompetent if the basis for

that inability to remember is medical rather

20

than something else.

argued is that we're -­

question presented, you ask whether a person, a

MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- of his commission

3

of the capital offense.

So do I take you now

4

to be saying that if you are left without

5

memory of the commission of the capital offense

6

for some reason that doesn't have something to

7

do with mental disability, that's not enough?

8

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I'm just -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if there's mental

10

disability that has given rise to this lack of

11

memory, then it is?

12

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I guess what I'm

13

conceding, Justice Kagan, is that we're arguing

14

that more is required than someone saying I

15

don't remember my crime, you can't execute me.

16

The state has an interest in being able to

17

impose punishment and to execute these kinds of

18

sentences with something more than "I don't

19

remember."

20

We've never argued that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I don't understand

21

-- I don't understand your answer.

I don't -­

22

I can't think of a situation in which a person

23

would lack memory of the commission of the

offense without that being based on a mental

condition.

mental condition.
MR. STEVENSON:

That -- well, that's

6

my point, Justice Alito.

7

would have to be accompanied by some mental

8

disability.

9

disability was dementia.

10

We're arguing that it

And here we argued that that

And the reason why I'm stressing that

11

is because you can't understand the nature of

12

that memory loss, you can't rely on it as a

13

credible basis for concluding that someone is

14

incompetent to be executed, until you

15

understand how that's possible.

16
17

And that's the only point I'm making,
is that without something to look to -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

I suppose what

19

people are thinking of, and I'm -- I'm not even

20

sure if this happens ever or whether there's

21

any sort of physiology behind this, but the

22

idea of a kind of fugue state or a blackout

23

that's unaccompanied by anything else, does

24

that count as the kind of mental disability

that you're talking about?

in the law for him.

you're going to be executed because you

committed a crime, but you don't remember

anything about it.

21

saying that's not enough.

I understand you to be

22

MR. STEVENSON:

Yeah.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then I

24

also understand the state, and we can ask them,

25

but I think it is in their brief, to say that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12

if, in fact, you meet the Ford standards, they

2

don't care how you got there; if you got there

3

because you have dementia, you still meet the

4

Ford standards.

5

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, but that's a

6

very different position than what we argued

7

below, because that was our argument, is that

8

we can meet the Ford standards when you

9

consider dementia as a legitimate basis for

10

rendering someone incompetent.

11

fact-findings were made through that lens.

12

And none of the

And I think on the first question,

13

what I'm arguing is that we recognize that it's

14

too easy for any offender to say "I don't

remember."

defenses of "I don't remember."

disorder that Mr. Madison has and he has no

there is a legitimate basis for arguing that

given for the moment that the other side has

conceded that severe dementia does qualify

under Ford and Panetti.

21

MR. STEVENSON:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
And I do -- I'm

23

going to ask the other side where the Court

24

addressed that issue, because I don't see it.

25

They seem to be thinking that only delusions

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14

could qualify, not incompetence.

2

that aside for the moment, how would I define

3

severe dementia?

4

MR. STEVENSON:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But putting

Yes.
What's the

6

difference between mild dementia, moderate, and

7

severe?

8

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And where would

10

the fact-finder settle in saying this person is

11

incompetent or not incompetent?

12

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

And that's where

13

the medical community has helped us a lot, that

14

science has -- has emerged and evolved quite a

15

bit.

16

for moving someone from possible dementia,

17

which we would argue would not be sufficient to

18

render someone incompetent to be executed, just

19

the allegation, some limited memory deficits.

20

Under the DSM-5, there are requirements

Moving someone from possible dementia

21

to probable dementia requires four things.

There needs to be an MRI where you can actually

That's right.
So let's get to

the definition.

20

MR. STEVENSON:

But I just -- I'm just

21

using the criteria that the medical community

22

gives to us.

23

to be able to assert and prove substantive -­

24

substantial cognitive decline, which we could

25

here.

It has that.

We -- we -- we have

His IQ has dropped dramatically.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

His

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

memory scores have dropped dramatically.

2

And what the DSM-5 requires is some

3

etiology, something that we can point to that

4

helps us understand the maturation of this

5

disease so that it's not early stage but late

6

stage.

7

And here, of course, you have two

8

life-threatening strokes where he almost died

9

and there were brain injuries.

10

He now has

cerebrovascular disease that we can see.

11

So, under those circumstances -- and I

12

-- I concede that there are going to be harder

13

cases, there could be harder cases, but under

14

these circumstances, the evidence is quite

15

dramatic.

16

There was no dispute that Mr. Madison

17

suffers from severe vascular dementia using the

18

criteria that the medical community has given

19

to us about these kinds of diseases, which is

20

why the state's concession that dementia could

21

be a basis is so significant.

22

What we wanted to prove to the judge

23

below is that dementia, when it has these

24

features, renders someone incompetent.

25

perfect example comes from the record.

Mr. Madison can explain to you that he

has a toilet in his cell.

3

He can explain to you that he can use that

toilet.

5

and he gets frustrated because he's asking the

6

guards to take him to the toilet.

7

It's a 5-by-8 cell.

But he routinely urinates on himself

He's not able to hold that memory of

8

the location of the toilet next to his bed when

9

it's time for him to urinate, and so he

10

continues to soil himself.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Madison

12

obviously has serious problems, serious

13

physical problems and mental problems, but I'm

14

quite confused by the arguments that you're

making.

16

Isn't it the case that in his order of

April 29 Judge Smith found that Madison failed

18

to prove by a preponderance of the evidence

punishment he is about to suffer and why he is

21

about to suffer it?

that's happened since then, and what you've

cited, are the -- the events concerning

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, that -- that -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that right?

17

MR. STEVENSON:

No, we've actually

18

contended that the court below should now

19

recognize what the Eleventh Circuit recognized,

20

which is that if you consider dementia, and you

21

apply what we know about dementia to this

22

circumstance, and to Ford and Panetti, you will

23

have to conclude that this man is not competent

24

to be executed.

25

And what the trial court did on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

argument of the state is say that we failed

2

because we did not make a threshold showing of

3

insanity.

4

trial court's order in this case starts with

5

our failure to show that he is delusional, and

6

ends with our failure to show that he's

7

delusional.

8
9

We did not show delusions.

The

We never suggested that we could prove
that he is delusional.

What we argued is that

10

his dementia renders him incompetent in a way

11

that does not permit the state, consistent with

12

the Eighth Amendment, to carry out this

13

execution.

14

And because dementia changes the

15

interpretation of these facts, as I was -- as I

16

was arguing, you can tell Mr. Madison that he

17

was convicted in Mobile, that this was the

18

crime, this was the circumstance.

19

onto that.

20

he's not going to have that memory.

21

deprives him of the kind of rational

22

understanding this Court talked about as being

23

critical in Ford and Panetti.

24
25

He can hold

But the next day, the next week,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that

Can I ask -- can I

give you two versions of your argument and you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

tell me which one you're arguing?

2

MR. STEVENSON:

Sure.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Or maybe you can tell

4

me that there's no difference -­

5

MR. STEVENSON:

Sure.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- between the two.

7

So one is just if you have severe dementia, you

8

are incompetent to be executed.

9

That's simple.

The other is, if you have severe

10

dementia, you are likely also to have a lack of

11

rational understanding of the kind we talked

12

about in Panetti.

13

So, in other words, the dementia would

14

be the -- the -- the -- the physiological

15

reason, but the standard would still be the

16

Panetti standard.

17

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I -- I think it's

18

the latter, Justice Kagan.

19

not arguing that just the mere proof of severe

20

dementia alone would satisfy the Eighth

21

Amendment because there are dementia sufferers

22

whose long-term memory is actually pretty

23

secured, pretty well intact.

24
25

We're not -- we're

They -- they -- they struggle mostly
with short-term memory.

And the nature of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

struggle might allow them to hold onto these

2

long-term memories in a way that they would

3

have a rational understanding of these

4

circumstances.

5

I don't think this is an area where

6

there can be the kind of clarity of category or

7

offense that would allow this Court to say

8

those people are incompetent, these people are

9

not.

10

And that's what this Court was dealing

with in Ford and Panetti.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what -- what then

12

-- as -- as probably you know, I think, that

13

there are many, many, many prisoners on death

14

row under threat of execution who are in their

15

40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, possibly 80s, who have been

16

there for 20, 30, 40 years perhaps.

17

will become a more common problem.

18

So this

The standard used in Ford is -- the

19

word they often use is insane.

20

Panetti, the word they use, he has no

21

comprehension of why he has been singled out.

22

All right?

23

All right?

In

If you are writing this standard for

24

the situation I described, what words would you

25

use?

What's the sentence that you believe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

should be seen in the U.S. reports in this on

2

-- on a problem that I think is general?

3

MR. STEVENSON:

Yeah, if I can just

4

first contextualize that problem before giving

5

that answer.

6

that the age of the offender is a predictor of

7

the scale of this phenomena, at least based on

8

what we're talking about here.

I mean, I -- I -- I don't think

9

And this was an issue that came up in

10

Ford, where there was a real concern about the

11

flood gates.

12

brief about the incidence, how frequently

13

competency to be executed -- competency to be

14

executed claims are raised.

15

relatively infrequent, Justice Breyer.

16

Ninety-three percent of the 1300 people who

17

have gotten execution dates over the last 30

18

years did not raise a competency to be executed

19

claim, even though many of them were older than

20

Mr. Madison.

21

And we put a footnote in our

Mr. Madison's problems are -- are

23

at any age.

MR. STEVENSON:

All sorts of things.

8

And so we could litigate each case, case by

9

case, or you answer what I -- I mean -­

10

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, that's right.

11

The rule I -- I would argue is that where

12

someone has a disability that renders them

13

incapable of orienting to time or place or

14

rationally understanding the circumstances of

15

their offense, they are incompetent.

16

has been no reliable determination of rational

17

understanding of the circumstances here,

18

because the court was unwilling to consider any

19

evidence about that mental state that was

20

outside the scope of insanity, delusion, or

21

psychosis.

22

And there

And we think, as the Eleventh Circuit

23

did, when you accept dementia as a relevant

24

basis for coming to that conclusion, the

25

Eleventh Circuit had no difficulty finding that

JUSTICE ALITO:

He's still under

investigation by whom?

19

MR. STEVENSON:

By the State of

20

Alabama.

There are multiple counties involved

21

in the circumstances that gave rise to this.

22

And our only point with that, Justice Alito, is

23

that the -- the court relied so heavily on this

24

conclusion that we didn't think was supported

25

by the record, that we -- we thought that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

was relevant that Dr. Kirkland's reliability be

2

addressed.

3

But our broad point was that, given

4

what we know about dementia, given that if you

5

apply dementia to these facts and

6

circumstances, the trial court would have to

7

conclude, like the Eleventh Circuit did, that

8

Mr. Madison is incompetent.

9

The state argued that you can't do

10

that in trial court; you can only find

11

incompetency if there's psychosis or insanity

12

or delusions.

13

trial court's rejection of our argument.

14

And that was the basis on the

And I don't think it's too difficult

15

to articulate this concept of -- of

16

incompetency that relates to rational

17

understanding, orientation, disorientation, is

18

a key factor.

19

for a court to articulate because, in a lot of

20

ways, your inability to orient to time and

21

place is going to undermine your ability to

22

rationally understand what's going on.

23
24
25

And that's for me perhaps useful

And that's a fairly well-developed
area of the medical profession.

officer?

8
9

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I'd -- I would

deal with that the same way the Court dealt

10

with that in Panetti.

11

understanding that someone who's convicted of a

12

murder can be executed does not help resolve

13

the question of whether this defendant has a

14

rational understanding of his circumstances.

15

The abstract

And the example that I use is a common

16

one, common problem you see in dementia.

17

someone goes to see their mother and their

18

mother doesn't recognize them, it's

19

heartbreaking.

20

understand that the reason why they can't

21

recognize you is dementia, you have a different

22

relation -- relationship to what that means.

23

It's devastating.

When

Once you

You can say "I'm your daughter," and

24

that person will respond to you as their

25

daughter.

But, when you come back the next

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

day, they don't have a rational understanding

2

of who you are.

3

And what the trial court and what the

4

state has argued is essentially, if we can get

5

the patient to say, "yes, that's my daughter,"

6

we can conclude that they have a rational

7

understanding of their circumstances, of their

8

family.

9

And that's the tragedy of dementia.

10

You can't sustain that understanding.

And

11

that's where the orientation to time and place

12

becomes critical.

13

Now there are other circumstances.

14

-- I just wanted to be clear that we're not

15

contending that this should be an unworkable

16

standard for states, that someone saying "I

17

don't remember" is sufficient.

11

So there's no question, and -- and

Dr. Goff was very clear about this, and the

condition will continue to degenerate and his

ability to function will diminish as well.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stevenson, the

court below believed that Dr. Kirkland and

Goff's evaluations were essentially similar.

20

Do you agree with that assessment?

don't, tell me how you relate that lack of

similarity to the question of his reliability.

Dr. Kirkland in no way was willing to

acknowledge dementia as relevant to his

evaluation.

the patient remembers were made without any

10

context or any understanding of dementia as

11

relevant to that.

12

So his fact-findings about what

Dr. Goff, on the other hand, said you

13

cannot find that Mr. Madison has any

14

independent recollection of the crime, the

15

circumstances, the events that led to his

16

arrest.

17

doesn't understand from day to day what's

18

happening, that he's disoriented, that he's

19

bewildered.

20

by Dr. Kirkland.

21

Dr. Goff made the finding that he

None of those findings were found

And so Dr. Goff's evaluation, of

course, was that he would not be competent to

facts.

the state ever acknowledged dementia as

MR. GOVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This Court granted certiorari on two

15

questions.

16

concerning whether the state may execute an

17

offender who does not remember committing the

18

capital offense, there is absolutely no

19

objective evidence of a national consensus

20

supporting such a rule, and Mr. Madison does

21

not offer any evidence to the contrary.

22
23

With respect to the first question

Now, on the second question
presented -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
-- can I start there?

Can I go back to

It seems to me as I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

reading through some of the materials that you

2

pointed to in your brief that, under the common

3

law, there were different kinds of -- of

4

defenses to murder, including lunacy.

5

one of your sources, Cowell, and the other

6

Hale, talking about lunacy being a condition

7

unlike insanity, which they defined as never

8

being in touch with reality.

9

lunacy as being able to remember some things

10
11

I see

They define

but not others.
And yet, to a source, the common law

12

excused lunatics, so that if states are folding

13

in dementia into lunacy, into insanity, into

14

other sort of broader labels just like the

15

common law did, how can I rely on your

16

statement that there's no consensus?

17

MR. GOVAN:

Well, Your Honor -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't even know

19

that we have to get there because your

20

adversary has said that he thinks this folds

21

into Ford and Panetti because it's not dementia

22

qua dementia; it's a certain kind of dementia

23

that doesn't put you in rational touch with

24

your decision-making in your moment.

25

putting that aside, I -- I'm taking on your

But,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

starting proposition.

2

MR. GOVAN:

Yes, Your Honor, for two

3

points.

The first, just to address the common

4

law, is that, when we look back at the common

5

law, they were addressing something different,

6

where someone has completely lost his wits.

7

We're talking about absolute madness.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, they define

9

"lunacy" as someone who can remember sometimes

10

and not remember -- have his wits sometime and

11

not have his wits other times.

12

MR. GOVAN:

Well, Your Honor, our -­

13

our view of the common law, and those sources,

14

we're talking about something different.

15

remembering the offense would not fit into

16

those categories of someone -- absolute madness

17

or -- or losing their wits.

18

And the second point -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not

Well, if you don't

20

think a demented person who today doesn't

21

remember you as your son, who doesn't know

22

where he or she is, who doesn't know to call -­

23

to go to the bathroom in the pot right next to

24

him -- you don't call that being out of your

25

wits?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

It could be that maybe tomorrow they

2

might for a few minutes remember, but at the

3

moment that they're having that episode, are

4

they within their wits?

5

MR. GOVAN:

Your Honor, we -- we have

6

not -- there -- there could be -- again,

7

dementia exists on a spectrum.

8

doubt there could be some case where someone

9

has dementia where they could have lost their

So there's no

10

wits or meet the Ford and Panetti standard, but

11

that's not what we have here.

12

And that's -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

14

-- it is my understanding, I'll ask the same

15

question I asked earlier of the two questions

16

accurate, you -- you are arguing that simply

17

because somebody doesn't remember the crime,

18

that that doesn't help satisfy Ford and

19

Panetti, right?

20

MR. GOVAN:

Correct, Your Honor.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you've

22

conceded that if the person meets the Ford and

23

Panetti standard by virtue of vascular

24

dementia, that he meets the Ford and Panetti

25

standard, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

MR. GOVAN:

Yes, yes, if someone has

2

vascular dementia or any other mental illness,

3

if it precludes them from having a rational

4

understanding of their punishment, and that

5

they will die when they're executed, they would

6

meet the Ford and Panetti standard.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so I

8

understand your friend who have conceded that

9

simply not remembering the crime is not enough.

10

And you're arguing that if it's vascular

11

dementia that affects you up to the point of

12

Ford and Panetti, that that is enough.

13

So are all we arguing about whether -­

14

is whether Mr. Madison himself meets the Ford

15

and Panetti standard?

After this Court summarily reversed

place where the court makes clear that it

2

understands that insanity is not a sine qua

3

non, that dementia could do the trick in

4

satisfying the Ford/Panetti standard?

5

Is there ever a place where the court

6

says, even though, you know, I understand that

7

I'm not necessarily looking for delusions or

8

schizophrenia or insanity and all the -- the

9

ways that we -- that we saw it in Ford and

10

Panetti, that if I find somebody who's

11

experiencing the kind of dementia that would

12

prevent him from having a rational

13

understanding of the crime and punishment, that

14

that's enough?

15

court makes clear that it knows that?

16

Is there ever a place where the

MR. GOVAN:

Well, yes, several parts,

17

Your Honor.

On page 3 and 4 of the court's

18

order, the 2016 order, it set out the Panetti

19

standard in full.

20

On page 10 of the court's order -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I don't think that

22

that does it.

I mean, you can set out the

23

Panetti standard.

24

understand that dementia can be the basis for

25

satisfying the Ford and Panetti standard.

The question is whether you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

MR. GOVAN:

Absolutely.

On page 6

2

through 8 of that court's order, the trial

3

court specifically outlined Dr. Goff's

4

testimony about that, including the fact that

5

he had had strokes, that because of those

6

strokes, he had had a loss, a memory loss, that

7

he had cognitive decline.

8

He considered -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But if you're

10

just listing that evidence, what you might

11

think as a court if you're looking for

12

delusions is that's all relevant, I'm listing

13

the evidence, but that's irrelevant.

14
15
16

Is there ever a place where the court
makes it clear that that is relevant?
MR. GOVAN:

Because it specifically

17

said in its conclusion on page 10 that it was

18

considering all the testimony of Dr. Goff and

19

that eventually made the final finding, which

20

That is, what does the state think about the

Ford or Panetti, which was mentioned, if the

two -- and it's not exclusive, but if two

things are true; one, he does not recall his

can't be present enough in time to rationally

because he can't retain information for long.

And why is that different than Panetti?

He's really not

In Panetti, the man was blaming

someone else, which may be even worse for some

people, or saying that someone else is going to

protect him.

But if you can't rationally

appreciate why you're putting -- being put to

death, how does that fulfill the Panetti

standard?

MR. GOVAN:

Your Honor, because this

case is different than the facts of Panetti.

So suppose he had

condition he now is in; that is, he can't see,

MR. GOVAN:

Judge, I don't know.

That

12

would be a situation that would -- would take

13

place in a normal sentencing hearing to

14

determine whether those mitigating

15

circumstances -- aggravating circumstances

16

outweigh the mitigators.

17

matters here is -- is that scenario would not

18

impact the state's -- the constitutionality of

19

seeking a death sentence or the -- the

20

propriety of seeking a death sentence, which,

21

again, nothing about Mr. Madison's conditions

22

impact the state's interest in seeking

23

retribution for a -- a heinous crime.

But I would say what

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

mean, what is the significance?

Do you -- I
I -- I would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

have thought all we were concerned about is

2

mental significance -- mental ability and

3

understanding, the various things, blindness,

5

-- is relevant under Ford and Panetti, is it?

6

MR. GOVAN:

None of that should

That's correct, Your

7

Honor.

That's correct.

In fact, Panetti talks

8

about something similar to that, that there

9

could be other -- another category of inmates

10

who, as a result of not mental illness, that

11

they're recalcitrant, they're callous, they -­

12

they blame other people for the crime.

13

that's not what Panetti is seeking to carve out

14

the narrow exception for people who are insane.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what

16

is your view on the significance of the MRI

evidence?

25

MRIs can

But MRIs can't help determine whether

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

something that is inherently going to come from

2

talking with a particular inmate and

3

particularly in this case, where the

4

dispositive fact that Mr. Madison is relying on

5

is that he can't remember the crime.

6

That's inherently something that only

7

comes from the defendant.

And he would have to

8

admit that, whether to a psychologist or in

9

testimony.

And that can't be the rule because,

10

if that was the case, no inmate would ever

11

admit to committing the crime if that meant

12

that he were incompetent.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you -­

14

you've already prevailed on that point at least

15

with respect to your adversary's view, right?

16

MR. GOVAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So I

18

would have thought we can stop arguing about

19

it, but -- we don't have to -- we don't have to

20

accept a concession, but the -- the concern

21

about the MRI evidence is that it would, if I

22

understand it, tend to show something that is

23

going to have a broader effect than just not

24

remembering the facts of the crime.

25

that not right?

Is -- is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

MR. GOVAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

2

MRI evidence can help.

3

suggestion as far as the -- the diagnosing.

4

that certainly can -- can help with the

5

individual fact determinations that a trial

6

court would make.

7

There is this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but

8

there's no MRI evidence that's going to be

9

looked at and you can say this shows that he

10

doesn't remember the facts of the crime.

11

doesn't -- isn't going to have broader

12

significance, right?

13

MR. GOVAN:

So

That's correct.

That

But,

14

again, in this -- in this case, of course, the

15

trial court did consider -- and just in this

16

particular case, did consider the fact that,

17

according to Dr. Goff, this was a progressive

18

disease.

19

held that there was a rational understanding.

20

But, at the end of the day, the court

I just -- one point I also want to

21

make in this particular case, that the

22

petition, whether Madison's position, whether

23

going to the first question or the second

24

question would be contrary to how competency

25

determinations are done across the board at any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

level, whether competency to stand trial,

2

competency to be executed, competency to waive

3

appeals.

4

They all function the same way.
It's not the fact that someone comes

5

to the court and says to a trial court:

Oh, I

6

have a -- I have this particular mental illness

7

and, therefore, I meet the competency standard.

8

It would apply the exact same way it occurred

9

here, that they -- that it would consider that

10

evidence and determine whether they have a

11

rational understanding.

12

trial court did here.

13

And that's what the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you would think

14

that if he came before the trial court on a

15

question of competence to stand trial with what

16

his mental condition is now, his lack of

17

orientation to time and place, that he would

18

have been found competent to stand trial?

19

MR. GOVAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I do,

20

because, again, he would have what the -- the

21

rational understanding that would be required

22

in even the competency to stand trial setting,

23

which is a rational understanding of the facts,

24

the factual proceedings, and the ability to

25

assist with counsel.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

And here, that's what Madison's expert

2

said, that he did understand, quote, "he has

3

been able to understand the nature of the

4

pending proceeding and he has an understanding

5

of what he was tried for."

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, yes.

And -- and -- and what

7

if what they meant by that was you can -- you

8

can make him understand what is going on today,

9

but then tomorrow he comes back and you have to

10

do it all over again, and then tomorrow -- the

11

next day comes back and you have to do it all

12

over again?

13

In other words, he -- you -- you can

14

-- you can -- you can get him to understand

15

something, but then he loses it.

16

because that's the way memory works with people

17

in this -- with this form of dementia.

18

What about that?

19

MR. GOVAN:

That's -­

Your Honor, that -- that

20

might be a closer question, again, that you

21

would determine on the factual circumstances in

22

front of that particular court.

23

that -- that's not what we have here.

24
25

But, again,

It was clear -- Mr. Madison said to
both experts that he remembered that he had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

three separate trials, that he was convicted of

2

a death sentence.

3

believed that he did not agree with the

4

particular sentence.

He -- to both experts, he

5

So that's not what we have here in

6

this particular case because, as this Court

7

noted before, both experts' testimony

8

demonstrated that he did have a rational

9

understanding of his particular sentence in

10

this case.

11

Another point that would just need -­

12

I just want to harken back to, the -- the fact

13

of -- we've talked about the original rule,

14

that Madison in the first question presented,

15

is that there's just simply no objective

16

evidence of a position supporting Madison's

17

position, either under the first or second

18

question presented.

19

No state legislature has determined

20

that prohibits states, of the 31 states that

21

have the death penalty, has prohibited states

22

from carrying out an execution for someone who

23

has a mental illness or who cannot remember the

24

particular facts of the crime.

25

The lower courts are -- are uniform in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

that respect in addressing competency as well,

2

and the Texas brief points that out in regards

3

to competency to stand trial.

4

in our brief that of the three states that have

5

addressed an issue similar to this, they have

6

all come down on Alabama's side, that simply

7

having dementia and not remembering the facts

8

of the crime does not prevent you per se from

9

having a rational understanding.

10

And we point out

So the final point I would just

11

mention to this Court is what, again, what

12

Madison seeks is unprecedented.

13

never created a categorical rule excluding

14

someone from capital punishment where at least

15

there was some objective evidence of a national

16

consensus in that direction.

17

none.

All those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56

things are included in Ford and Panetti.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. GOVAN:

And -­

And the thing is that in

4

this case, the trial court did consider them

5

and found that notwithstanding those

6

conditions, the fact that he had these strokes

7

and memory loss, he still had a rational

8

understanding of his -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. GOVAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's -­

-- crime and punishment.
-- interesting to

12

me because I don't read anywhere in Kirkland

13

where he did any analysis of rationality.

14

he did, as I understood it, is just does he

15

remember his crime or something -- he doesn't

16

remember his crime, but does he understand

17

where he is and what they're going to do to

18

him?

19

understanding.

20

What

That's not the same as rational

He did no memory test to see how long

21

Mr. Madison retained information generally.

22

did not describe the extent of his dementia.

23

He didn't do any of the things one would expect

24

if he was going to opine on rationality.

25

So how -- the only one who did that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

He

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

was Dr. Goff, and that part of his discussion

2

was not addressed by the Court below at all.

3

MR. GOVAN:

4

response to that, Your Honor.

5

number one, on page 2 of Dr. Kirkland's report,

6

he did set out the Ford and Panetti standard.

7

Just -- just two points in
We disagree,

And as the trial court noted in the

8

hearing, doctor -- that particular doctor had

9

done, I think, approximately 4,000 competency

10

evaluations, which was for competency to stand

11

trial, was -- is similar to the standard for

12

competency to be executed, as the Texas brief

13

points out, and he did analyze the rational

14

understanding.

15

And it would make sense, again, why

16

Dr. Kirkland would not specifically inquire to

17

whether an inmate would remember committing the

18

crime, because that is not determinative under

19

Ford and Panetti.

20

Madison does have a rational understanding that

21

he was convicted of the crime of murder, that

22

he will be executed for that murder, we would

23

ask this Court to affirm the state court.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

Thank you.

6

I just want to stress and invite this

7

Court to look at the Eleventh Circuit pleadings

8

where the state took the exactly opposite

9

position.

10

There has been no point prior to this

11

Court where the state has acknowledged that

12

dementia would be a basis on which a court

13

could find someone incompetent to be executed.

14

Their brief, the post-hearing brief that they

15

filed after the hearing begins, "Initially, it

16

must be noted that Madison has failed to

17

implicate Ford or Panetti in this proceeding.

18

Both the court-appointed expert and the

19

defense-retained expert agree that Madison does

20

not suffer from psychosis or delusions."

21

That was the circle they drew around

22

the evidentiary consideration.

Dr. Kirkland,

23

after hearing Dr. Goff's testimony, says "I

24

agree with it," but he conceded, he expressly

stated that he doesn't believe it's relevant

because of the very narrow legal standard here.
And that very legal -- narrow legal

3

standard was given to him and to the court by

4

the state as only including psychosis,

5

delusions, and insanity.

6

Circuit, they made that argument.

7

why the Eleventh Circuit made the judgment

8

that, if you consider dementia, you come to a

9

different finding.

At the Eleventh
And that's

10

I just don't think it's credible to

11

argue that the judge in this case considered

12

dementia and made a determination that Mr.

13

Madison's dementia does not leave him competent

14

to be executed.

15

And to that extent, we've never argued

16

that this is a case about a categorical ban on

17

executing people with a certain kind of

18

condition.

19

Court has held in Ford and Panetti that it is

20

unconstitutional to execute people who are

21

incompetent.

22

what this Court has acknowledged.

23

What we've argued is that this

And we've rooted that argument on

The Court has said:

Look, the death

24

penalty gives the state an incredible power.

25

It's an awesome power.

The authority to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

execute someone who is not an immediate threat

2

is an awesome power.

3

utilized fairly, reliably, and humanely.

4

Court's jurisprudence in Ford and Panetti

5

speaks to the humane part.

6

And that power has to be
This

And what this Court said is that if

7

someone is disabled and incompetent and fragile

8

and bewildered and confused in the way that we

9

have seen, in the context of insanity, in the

10

context of other kinds of mental illness, it is

11

simply not humane to execute them.

12

And in that regard, the Eighth

13

Amendment here plays a different role than some

14

of the other amendments.

15

looks at facts and circumstances through the

16

lens of the Constitution, through the window of

17

the Constitution, and we have that here.

18

The Court always

But the Eighth Amendment isn't just a

19

window.

It's a mirror.

And what the Court has

20

said is that our norms, our values are

21

implicated, when we do things to really

22

fragile, really vulnerable people.

23

we've argued is that dementia in this case

24

renders Mr. Madison frail, bewildered,

25

vulnerable in a way that cannot be reconciled

And what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61

2

with executing him because of his incompetency.
The state never acknowledged that

3

argument as a base -- a valid argument.

4

court never made a finding about that argument.

5

And we believe that when you consider the facts

6

of his dementia and this Court's holdings, that

7

a determination that executing someone in this

8

condition cannot be reconciled with an Eighth

9

Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual

10
11

The

punishment.
And for that reason, this awesome

12

power that the state has requires obligations,

13

requires oversight.

14

didn't meet those obligations and oversight by

15

making the informed determination that his

16

dementia does not leave him so incapacitated

17

that he is incompetent to be executed.

18

never said anything about dementia.

19

And, here, the state

They

And so I don't think this Court can

20

rely on the argument that somehow, in this

21

invisible record, with no reference to dementia

22

by the state, by the expert, or by the court,

23

that that determination has been found.

24
25

The only court to make a determination
about the relevance of dementia here was the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

Eleventh Circuit.

2

is that when you look at the level of despair

3

and the level of confusion and the level of

4

injury -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, you're right,

5

it's not just the physical symptoms.

6

just that he's blind and can't walk and can't

7

speak, but those symptoms reinforce the

8

credibility, the legitimacy, the severity of

9

his acute dementia.

10

And what they clearly found

It's not

And we don't believe this Court can,

11

consistent with the Eighth Amendment's

12

prohibition against cruel and unusual

13

punishment, allow an execution of someone

14

impaired in the way that Mr. Madison is

15

impaired or to allow any defendant to be

16

declared competent to be executed with these

17

kinds of clear, medically verifiable disorders.

18

And for that reason, we would ask this

19

Court to reverse the lower court judgment.

20

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Thank you,
