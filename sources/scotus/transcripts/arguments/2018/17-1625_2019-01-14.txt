CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument next this morning in Case 17-1625,

5

Rimini Street, Incorporated versus Oracle USA.

6

Mr. Perry.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. PERRY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The term "costs" is a term of art in

12

federal law.

13

times:

14

Murphy.

15

This Court has held as much three

in Crawford Fitting, in Casey, and in

It is defined in Section 1920 of Title

16

28, and the Court also has held that three

17

times in those three same cases.

18

In the Taniguchi case, the Court's

19

most recent decision in this line, the Court

20

emphasized that "costs" in federal law does not

21

have its ordinary meaning but, rather, has this

22

specialized meaning.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

about full costs?

25

right?

Well, what

I mean, that's the issue,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, it is.

2

Congress can, of course, override the default

3

definition, and when it does so, it must do it

4

explicitly.

5

costs."

6

We have here two words, "full

We actually agree, my friend

7

Mr. Clement and I, on "full."

It means all or

8

all that can be contained or complete or

9

something of that nature.

10

The dispute is on "costs" because just

11

as the full moon doesn't tell us anything about

12

Mars and Venus, "full costs," we submit,

13

doesn't tell the court anything about fees and

14

expenses.

15

And Congress has been careful in

16

separating out those concepts, and this Court

17

has been careful in separating them out.

18

Murphy, the case that involved costs under the

19

IDEA, specifically contrasted the word "costs"

20

with the word "expenses" and said "expenses" is

21

open-ended and might include travel expenses

22

and salaries and so forth, whereas costs, we

23

know, are these things under Section 1920.

24
25

And in Murphy, the Court told all of
us, the lower courts and the bar, and Congress,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

what it takes to override that presumption.

2

The Court said, and this is a quote from page

3

301, "No statute will be construed as

4

authorizing the taxation of witness fees as

5

costs unless the statute refers explicitly to

6

witness fees."

7

So here, in Section 505, Your Honors,

8

we have a statute that does not refer

9

explicitly to witness fees and, under a plain

10

application of Murphy, cannot authorize witness

11

fees.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Perry, I -- I

13

understand all that case law.

14

adversary would argue, number one, that full

15

costs in the Copyright Act predated -- predated

16

both the definitional inclusion of costs in the

17

federal statutes and that it had a history, a

18

meaning, independent of what happened later.

19
20

I think your

You haven't addressed how you get rid
of that independent meaning argument.

21

MR. PERRY:

If I could address --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Number two, I

23

think your adversary pointed us to three

24

statutes of many that have the word "full

25

costs."

Give me a meaning to those three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

statutes that would give effect to the word

2

"full."

3

MR. PERRY:

Justice Sotomayor, if I

4

can take those in reverse order.

5

we submit, means all costs.

6

contrast that with section --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Full costs,

And let me

But it's

8

discretionary under both the Copyright Act now

9

and under the statute.

10

MR. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor, but in

11

Crawford Fitting, the Court said the discretion

12

is the on/off switch -- the question -- under

13

54(d), whether or not to give costs.

14

the discretion.

15
16
17

That is

And let me contrast it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The government

hasn't excepted that yet, though.
MR. PERRY:

Well, Section 2412, which

18

this Court identified in the Baker Botts case

19

as the clearest example of a cost statute that

20

overrides the presumption, says that costs in a

21

government case can be awarded in whole or in

22

part -- Congress understands that concept --

23

whereas, in a copyright case, they're awarded

24

full costs.

25

It means all costs.

And -- and we know from history that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

that's what courts did.

And we also know, to

2

go back to your first part of your question,

3

Your Honor, is that the courts did not award

4

any non-taxable expenditures.

5

1976, there are 858 copyright cases awarding

6

costs.

7

not on a statutory schedule under either state

8

law or federal law.

From 1831 to

9

Not one case has ever awarded any cost

That tells the Court that our

10

construction is correct historically and my

11

opponent's construction has no historical

12

support.

13

ever read the statute the way the Ninth Circuit

14

read it in the Twentieth Century Fox case.

15

fact, that is the first case in the history of

16

the United States --

17

There is not a single case that has

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In

Could you point me

18

to where in your brief or an amici accounted

19

for those 800 cases?

20

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, we don't have

21

them all listed out.

We pointed out in the

22

reply brief that my friends on the other side

23

and all of their amici had not cited a single

24

case on their point.

25

were right, I went through and had my team read

And to confirm that we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

every single one of them.

2

(Laughter.)

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- your --

4

your argument, though, would assume there are a

5

lot of cases where, although costs were

6

awarded, they weren't all costs.

7

those do you have?

8

MR. PERRY:

9

either, Your Honor.

10

How many of

We don't have any of those
It appears that costs --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why

11

would Congress be worried about saying "full

12

costs"?

13

fewer than few costs or less than few costs.

14

Nobody's ever apparently ever awarded

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, we think it

15

came out of the English copyright statute,

16

which says full costs.

17

it's a historical artifact, if you will.

18

went back through the history, though, and part

19

of the point of the historical analysis is to

20

see whether that phrase had some specialized

21

meaning, either in England or in the States, as

22

being beyond scheduled costs or fee bill costs.

23

And the answer is no.

24

authority for that.

25

It's a -- it's an -We

There's absolutely no

And so we have this -- this language

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

that is antiquated, but it has been carried

2

through.

Our interpretation does give it

3

meaning.

It is all costs, full costs, every

4

cost to which you're entitled under the

5

statutes.

6

language.

And that's all we typically ask of

7

My friends, on the other hand --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

If you're right, why

have the provision at all?

Wouldn't 1920 do

the trick?

11

MR. PERRY:

Well, Your Honor, there's

12

208 federal cost statutes; 207 of them don't

13

reference 1920 either.

14

words, makes cost provisions and expense

15

provisions and fee provisions and other things

16

in many, many statutes, which would all be in

17

one sense redundant of 1920.

Congress, in other

18

This Court dealt with that in the Marx

19

case in the context of Rule 54(d) and said that

20

kind of redundancy is to be expected with

21

respect to cost statutes because Congress has

22

them here.

23

And there's a good reason for it, Your

24

Honor.

When Congress wants to change what a

25

cost is -- for example, Taniguchi involved the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

interpreters -- Congress can amend 1920 and add

2

interpreters, or it could take out e-discovery,

3

or it could do whatever it wants, and then that

4

propagates out through 208 statutes

5

automatically because what is a cost in -- in

6

1920 goes out through all the cost statutes.

7

Under the alternative construction, we

8

would -- Congress would have to go through 208

9

times and amend all of them.

And, of course,

10

this Court would have to go through 208 times

11

and construe all of them to figure out what's a

12

cost or not a cost.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

reason for having 1920.

15

for repeating yourself.

16

MR. PERRY:

Well, that's a good
It's not a good reason

Well, it doesn't repeat

17

itself either, Your Honor.

18

may tax as costs the following things.

19

defines the taxable costs and the power of a

20

federal court.

21

the prevailing party costs.

22

1920 says a court
So it

54(d) says a court should award

505 doesn't say either of those.

505

23

says the court may allow as a recovery costs,

24

full costs, to any party.

25

can award costs to the non-prevailing party.

Under 505, the court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

That's a total departure from 1920.

2

that is not authorized by 1920, in fact.

3

Section 505 has much independent work to do.

4

That -So

The second sentence of 505 also

5

authorizes attorneys' fees.

6

textual, structural point that gives weight to

7

our side and not the other, because Congress

8

understood that full costs did not include

9

attorneys' fees, and when it explicitly

10

provided for it, that entire sentence is

11

rendered superfluous under Mr. Clement's

12

definition.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

This, again, is a

Well, it says -- the

14

second sentence says that the -- the court may

15

award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the

16

costs.

17

that "costs" has a very narrow meaning that

18

can't include attorneys' fees?

19

So what does that do to your argument

MR. PERRY:

It -- it confirms it,

20

Justice Alito.

21

formulation in Murphy and in Casey, as part of

22

the costs.

23

Congress can explicitly override 1920, it's by

24

adding additional things as costs.

25

That was the exact same

So, when -- when this Court says

To say a fee is a cost is to say it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

wouldn't be in the absence of an express

2

congressional direction.

3

the second sentence that very express

4

congressional direction that is required.

5

And, here, we have in

By calling the fees a cost for those

6

purposes, it's making clear, among other

7

things, that expert witness fees are not costs

8

because, otherwise, they would have to be

9

separately provided for as well.

10

In fact, Your Honor, there is no

11

statute in the U.S. code that provides all

12

expenses of litigation, and for good reason.

13

We have the American rule.

14

American rule since at least 1796 that says, in

15

general, each party bears its own fees, costs,

16

expenses, burdens.

17

We've had the

It is -- it is -- the background

18

presumption is that costs are not shifted.

19

Fees are not shifted.

20

shifted.

21

has required an explicit statement, a clear

22

statement, an unmistakable statement from

23

Congress to invade that common law principle,

24

to invade the American rule, and to change the

25

background presumption.

Expenses are not

And this Court over and over again

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

We have here a phrase, "full costs,"

2

that is not explicit.

3

today shows that it's not explicit.

4

does contain a word that this Court has

5

construed over and over and over again.

6

The fact that we're here
But it

Given that approach, in other words,

7

not including fees, not including discovery,

8

not including travel, not including salaries,

9

unless Congress were to explicitly say so,

10

would be consistent with the way the Court has

11

construed every other statute.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there a -- I read

13

in the briefs, and I don't fully -- I want to

14

be certain I grasped the argument, that there

15

was a period of time many, many, many years ago

16

when a court in awarding costs, a federal

17

court, would look to state statutes, and the

18

state statutes provided different amounts and

19

didn't just repeat what we have today.

20

MR. PERRY:

Correct.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then I thought

22

that you had argued that, well, the word "full

23

costs" means don't just look -- there are other

24

things they don't look to the state statutes,

25

but if state statute A awarded 33 cents and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

state statute B awarded $4,000, it would mean

2

that you go and look to the actual cost.

3
4

MR. PERRY:

Our argument is a little

different than that, Justice Breyer.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is that?

6

what I'm trying to find out.

7

MR. PERRY:

That's

In 1831, when state law

8

would have applied, many states had gradated

9

fee schedules.

They had these very complicated

10

fee bills.

11

could get half cost, double cost, costs and a

12

half, treble costs.

13

we think, one of the things it may have meant

14

-- and, again, this is -- we're interpreting

15

here -- was costs, right, full costs of the

16

action.

17

And in New York, for example, you

And what full costs, we --

The second thing it likely was doing,

18

and what Congress told us in 1909 it was doing,

19

was to override the statutory threshold on cost

20

recoveries in federal court, established in the

21

Judiciary Act of 1789.

22

At that time, if the prevailing party

23

didn't win $500, it didn't get its costs at

24

all.

25

And Congress said:

No, in a copyright

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

case, if you win, you can get your full costs

2

pursuant to the state schedule.

3

historical examples of what Congress may well

4

have been doing.

So those are

5

And, again, the English experience,

6

where full cost appears since the statute of

7

it --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When I read this

9

argument, the first prong by you, I thought

10

could it mean full costs, 1920, without the

11

limits of 1821?

12

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, it -- it

13

unlikely means that since 1920 and 1821 were

14

separated by the codifiers.

15

-- you know, the enrolled bills, going back to

16

the fee bill of 1853, that was a unitary

17

schedule of the allowable costs and amounts.

18

If you look at the

As the -- as the statute has been

19

codified, they've been separated into different

20

sections, but I think they all perform the same

21

function.

22

Certainly, you know, in the -- in the

23

19th Century cases, applying the fee bill, The

24

Baltimore, for example, in Day versus

25

Woodworth, the Court looked at the -- at the --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

at the fee schedule as a unitary fashion.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I -- I

3

understand that, but I still don't -- I'm still

4

trying to give meaning to "full."

5

MR. PERRY:

Certainly, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and so 1821

7

sets certain limits.

8

to not invoke those limits but just to permit

9

awards of what's specified in 1920, would that

10

If we read "full costs"

take care of your problem?

11

MR. PERRY:

I think that would give

12

meaning to the word "full."

13

remain binding.

14

at it would be, say, for example, on witness

15

fees, 1821 says $40 a day.

16

a day.

17

to give $20 or $10 or $5, but under a full cost

18

provision, it has to give the full $40 because

19

that's the maximum Congress has specified.

20

I think 1821 would

I think the easier way to look

Full cost means $40

In a normal case, a court could choose

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you -- you

21

haven't found a single case where that was an

22

issue?

23

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, it -- it

24

hasn't been litigated, in part because I think

25

cost bills generally are approved as a matter

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

of course.

2

ago, they -- they were approved on one day's

3

notice by the clerk.

4

Remember, until just a few years

I mean, most of us don't even litigate

5

cost bills because the -- the -- the cost to

6

oppose them is greater than the cost bill

7

itself.

8

where many tens of millions of dollars have

9

been added in for non-cost expenses that would

10

It's only in a case like this one

get to litigation of these points.

11

So there is not -- to directly answer

12

your question, Mr. Chief Justice, there's not a

13

great deal of litigation on either side of the

14

-- of the question.

15

We can see --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you help me

16

with just a fact, which may or may not be

17

relevant, but in the SG's brief, the costs that

18

you were searching was about $5 million.

19

That's your view of what they're entitled to.

20
21
22

MR. PERRY:

Three and a half million,

but yeah.
JUSTICE BREYER:
All right.

Three and a half

23

million now?

Three and a half.

24

And what they want is 17 and a half million.

25

Does that 17 and a half million include

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

attorneys' fees?

2

MR. PERRY:

No, Your Honor.

3

Attorneys' fees were dealt with.

4

some million dollar attorneys' fees award

5

that's entirely separate from that.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a 20

All right.

7

20 million in attorneys' fees.

8

a half million in everybody concedes.

9

MR. PERRY:

10
11

It's three and

Taxable costs.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, and then they

want an additional 17.6 million more?

12
13

So it's

MR. PERRY:

And they were awarded

12.8 million because of some deductions.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So they

15

-- so it's 12.8 plus -- this is -- this is a

16

big amount here -- so it's about 32,

17

$35 million in costs.

18

award?

19
20
21

MR. PERRY:

And what was the damage

Thirty-five million

dollars, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

35 million goes to -- to cost?

23

million to get 35 million?

24
25

MR. PERRY:

So the entire
It cost 35

The costs and -- and

expenses asserted by Oracle in this case were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

greater than the damages awarded by the jury,

2

that is correct.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now I

4

don't know if that's relevant, but it does seem

5

a problem, if not in this case.

6

what -- what -- what -- what is this -- somehow

7

there's something odd about this, but -- but I

8

-- but I don't know what.

9

MR. PERRY:

But what --

Your Honor, I will say the

10

only thing odd about it is that this award was

11

made.

12

the plain statement requirement, that

13

$12.8 million should be taken off the ledger,

14

which would make the whole thing a little more

15

fair for everybody.

16
17

If we go back to the American rule and

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. PERRY:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM FOR THE

17

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This Court has treated "costs" as a

18

term of art defined by the list in

19

Section 1920.

20

litigants navigate more than 200 statutes that

21

use the term.

22

baseline against which to legislate and

23

respects history because federal law has always

24

defined by statute the costs that could be

25

shifted between parties in cases at common law.

That formula helps courts and

It gives Congress a clear

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

Let's start with the history.

Justice

2

Sotomayor, you asked a question about the

3

priority of enactment, the fact that this

4

statute was originally enacted in 1831, even

5

though the current version of Section 1920 is

6

much more recent.

7

What this Court said in Crawford

8

Fitting is that the priority of enactment does

9

not matter.

Section 1920 presumptively applies

10

in all civil cases, regardless of when those

11

provisions were adopted.

12

Going back to the original history,

13

what is it that the term "full costs" was

14

enacted in order to do?

15

a couple things.

16

We think that it does

Five days after setting up the federal

17

judiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act,

18

telling federal courts to look to state fee

19

bills in order to determine which costs could

20

be shifted between litigants.

21

regime that prevailed at the time that this

22

provision was added to the Copyright Act in

23

1831.

24
25

That was the

There were two general types of state
fee bill provisions that would have made the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

word "full" in full costs necessary, and we

2

give a couple examples on page 17 of our brief,

3

Footnote 1.

4

The first type of case are statutes

5

that impose some sort of limitation on costs.

6

So an example would be the first statute, a

7

Kentucky statute providing "the plaintiff shall

8

recover his full costs although the damages do

9

not exceed 40 shillings."

There were a number

10

of statutes that said, if your damages were not

11

above a certain threshold, you would get no

12

more cost than damages.

13

typical amount.

14

Forty shillings was a

So this provision tells you that, even

15

if your damages are below that type of

16

threshold, nevertheless, you get your full

17

costs.

18

The second type of case is a case of a

19

statutory multiplier.

20

statute, for instance, provided a landlord can

21

recover "double the value of rent in arrear and

22

distrained for with full costs of the suit."

23

So you get double damages along with your full

24

costs.

25

So the Mississippi

And that's actually the sense in which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

we think the 1831 Copyright Act used the term

2

"full costs" because, remember, that for an

3

infringement, half of any forfeiture would go

4

to the government and the other half would go

5

to the plaintiff, along with their full costs.

6

So the word "full" in that phrase

7

tells you, even though the plaintiff is only

8

getting half of the recovery, nevertheless, the

9

plaintiff gets their full costs.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in 1831,

11

according to your argument, federal law didn't

12

really care -- didn't -- didn't have its own

13

definition of what a cost would be.

14

costs were whatever the states regarded as

15

costs, right?

16
17

MR. KEDEM:

It --

It wasn't a definitional

provision.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Whatever it -- was in

19

the -- and so, if I looked at every single one

20

of the state fee schedules in 1831, what would

21

I find?

22

MR. KEDEM:

So you would see --

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would I find that they

24

all agree on what the concept of a cost is, or

25

would I find that some of them include maybe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

the sort of things that were compensated here?

2

MR. KEDEM:

3

things that are significant.

4

So I think you'd find two

First of all, you would not see any

5

discovery fees and you would certainly not see

6

any expert witness fees.

7

aware, there is no fee bill from the

8

19th Century that awarded expert witness fees.

9

The other thing that you would see is

As far as we're

10

that they're comprehensive.

11

great detail and precisely spell out all of the

12

different rates for the various things that

13

could be taxed by the clerk of the court.

14

They go on in

And that's significant because, in

15

1853, Congress passed its own federal fee bill,

16

which was also incredibly thorough.

17

for nine pages and spells out all of the

18

different compensable categories.

19

It goes on

And what this Court said in Crawford

20

Fitting, the reason that it's treating

21

Section 1920 as a definitional provision, even

22

though, if you look at it, it's not

23

unambiguously written as a definitional

24

provision, is that Congress's intent was

25

apparently comprehensive and exhaustive.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

other words, Congress did not want to leave

2

anything undefined.

3

To buy Respondents' story, you would

4

have to believe that, in 1831, even though

5

Congress had never left things undefined

6

before, it created a new regime, different from

7

the one set up by the Process Act, of full

8

compensation, essentially forcing federal

9

courts to create their own copyright-specific

10

fee bills, and that it achieved that objective

11

simply by adding the word "full" in front of

12

"costs."

13

And it's not as if the term "full

14

costs" in Anglo-American law had some separate

15

understood definition.

16

number of authorities interpreting statutes

17

under English law.

18

before 1831, some of them are after 1831, but

19

they're all interpreting statutes that are from

20

the 1600s and the 1700s, saying what those

21

statutes has always been understood to mean,

22

including in the context of the copyright case.

23

There is a statute called -- there's a

We point you to a

Now some of the cases are

24

case called Avery, which interprets the

25

Copyright Act of -- I think it was 1842 or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

something like that, and it says there is no

2

understood distinction between costs that can

3

be awarded in a statute that mentions full

4

costs and one that just mentions costs.

5

And that's true in the Copyright Act

6

going back to the statute of Anne in 1709,

7

which is the predecessor to all early American

8

copyright law.

9

Now, Justice Breyer, you made the

10

point that it's very expensive in many cases to

11

litigate these issues.

12

experts; experts cost money.

13

You're going to need

And that is true.

To some extent, the

14

baseline rule that Congress has created and

15

this Court has observed means that you're going

16

to undercompensate people because cost is

17

almost always a fraction of your total

18

litigation expenses.

19

The same argument was made in Murphy,

20

that, for instance, a parent who wants to sue

21

under the IDEA will have a lot of trouble

22

making their case unless they can hire an

23

expert, which is expensive.

24

was made in Casey about civil rights

25

plaintiffs.

The same argument

If it didn't carry the day in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

case and in those contexts, then certainly it

2

shouldn't win here in the copyright context.

3

But, you know, Congress can respond in

4

exactly the way that it did to this Court's

5

decision in Casey.

6

you can't get your expert fees in certain civil

7

rights cases.

8

adding expert fees to the list of compensable

9

expenses under Section 1988, which governs

10
11

In Casey, this Court said

And so Congress passed a statute

those civil -- same civil rights cases.
The benefit of the Crawford Fitting

12

formula is that it provides clear instructions

13

to Congress to tell them if you want to include

14

something that's not already listed in

15

Section 1920, here's how you do it.

16

friend pointed out, it propagates all the way

17

through if you amend Section 1920 itself, or

18

you can create a specific provision.

19

And as my

Now you might think all of this

20

history is a bit of a muddle.

Another benefit

21

of the Crawford Fitting rule is that you don't

22

have to perform a historical exegesis every

23

time you come across a new provision with

24

slightly different language.

25

cost provisions are incredibly variable.

And remember that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

talk about costs, costs for the proceeding,

2

court costs, costs of the action, full costs,

3

all costs.

4

Justice Sotomayor, you brought up four

5

additional statutes enacted more recently than

6

this one which mention full costs, and you

7

asked:

8

Why did they do that?
So, first of all, let's just say --

9

put the point that all of them deal with

10

intellectual property in some fashion, so

11

chances are they were just copied from

12

Section 505.

13

But they all also specifically mention

14

attorneys' fees, which is a big problem on

15

Respondents' side because, if full costs

16

already meant total compensation, there would

17

have been no point in expressly adding

18

attorneys' fees.

19

Now Respondents' response to that is,

20

well, in 1909, when the American rule wasn't

21

well established, it was necessary to clarify

22

that attorneys' fees were included in full

23

costs.

24

the copyright statute as it was enacted then

25

made full costs mandatory but attorneys' fees

That doesn't work even in 1909 because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

discretionary.

2

So, clearly, Congress wasn't just

3

clarifying that the latter was included in the

4

former.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Clement may

6

have a surplusage problem, but you have a

7

surplusage problem too, don't you?

8

MR. KEDEM:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

So we think that -"Full" -- it means

nothing.
MR. KEDEM:

Yeah.

So starting in 1976

12

when the provision was switched from

13

discretionary to mandatory, then there is some

14

redundancy with the authority that already

15

existed under Section 1920.

16

First of all, Congress generally

17

doesn't tinker with existing language unless

18

there was some reason to think that it was a

19

problem, and, as my friend said, it was not

20

until 2005 that the Copyright -- that anyone

21

thought that the Copyright Act included

22

something beyond what was already included in

23

Section 1920, so there was no reason at that

24

time for Congress to think there was a problem.

25

And, to be honest, had Congress taken

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

the word "full" out of the statute in 1976, no

2

doubt someone would have used that fact to

3

argue, well, clearly, Congress was displeased

4

with the broad copyright cost awards and,

5

therefore, would have used it to argue for a

6

narrower rule.

7
8

But I think the probably most
unsatisfying but most adequate answer --

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

10

would that have worked?

11

worked.

12

MR. KEDEM:

How would -- how

That wouldn't have

Well, I think you could

13

have argued in a case like this one that even

14

for the costs that are authorized in

15

Section 1920, you can't get the full amount of

16

it or you can't presumptively get the full

17

amount of it because Congress took the word

18

"full" out, so, clearly, it wanted to cut back

19

on the costs that were awardable.

20

saying it would have won, but that was an

21

argument that someone might have made.

22

think --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not

But I

You didn't adopt

24

your adversary's on-and-off switch for the

25

meaning of "full."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

MR. KEDEM:

That -- that's correct.

2

That's the one place, I think, that we're

3

different.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. KEDEM:

So explain --

So -- yeah.

It -- it's

6

not at issue here and it wasn't litigated, but,

7

you know, we think it is plausibly -- textually

8

plausible to adopt that reading, but probably,

9

if Congress wanted to put district courts to

10

the unnatural choice of all or nothing, then it

11

would have used clearer language.

12

problem doesn't go away on Respondents' side.

13

It gets worse because the costs are that much

14

greater.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The authorization in Section 505 of

23

the Copyright Act for the recovery of full

24

costs means what it says and authorizes the

25

recovery of full costs, not just a narrow

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

subset of costs set forth in Section 1920 as

2

limited by Section 1821.

3

The contrary reading not only renders

4

the word "full" completely superfluous, but it

5

also effectively renders the first sentence of

6

Section 505 without any meaning and renders

7

three other federal statutes that authorize the

8

discretionary award of full costs meaningless

9

the day they were enacted.

10

There is no reason to adopt a

11

construction that has those kind of

12

consequences in rendering other statutory

13

provisions superfluous.

14

to say that "full" means full, rather than

15

nothing at all.

16

The better course is

Now I'd like to start with a response

17

to Justice Alito's question about what we can

18

tell that would have happened between 1831 and

19

1853.

20

Neither side here has a lot of case

21

law to talk about, and that's because in the

22

vast, vast majority of these, and both sides

23

have looked for it, the courts just awarded

24

costs and didn't say another word about it.

25

And sometimes they even awarded costs as part

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1
2

of damages.
The -- probably the best case that

3

tells you something about what was going on, at

4

least between 1831 and 1853, is a case called

5

Ferrett against Atwill that's cited by my

6

friends in their brief, and this is Justice

7

Nelson riding on circuit.

8
9

The Court here -- the -- as -- as a
circuit justice, he actually says something

10

about costs because you have a case where,

11

essentially, there are 11 works at issue and

12

there were 11 suits.

13

and resisted the claim in all 11 suits

14

basically tried to get kind of 11 of

15

everything.

16

sort of sort through that.

17

And the defendant who won

And so that required the courts to

Now I think two things are telling

18

about this opinion.

19

costs, and this cases arises in New York, the

20

judge -- Justice Nelson doesn't look

21

exclusively to New York law.

22

York law for some things, but he also looks to

23

a then extant federal circuit rule to address

24

one of the other items of costs.

25

First, in deciding the

He looks to New

And so I think he's doing exactly what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

you expect somebody to do when they have a

2

federal law requirement of full costs but not a

3

lot of other federal law.

4

little federal law there is, the circuit rule,

5

and then they also look to state practice.

6

They look to what

But the second thing -- and this is

7

what I think is most directly responsive to

8

Justice Alito's question and I think most

9

important -- is the last item of costs that

10

Justice Nelson awards is "attorney and counsel

11

fees on argument are taxable in each case."

12

Now I assume but I don't know for sure

13

that it may be that under the New York

14

schedule, that those attorneys and counsel's

15

fee were taxable.

16

that.

17

The opinion doesn't tell us

But the one thing it tells us

18

absolutely certainly is that Petitioners are

19

dead wrong when they say that between 1831 and

20

1853, full costs would have been well

21

understood by everybody to be limited to party

22

and party costs and not cover something like

23

attorneys and counsel fee for argument.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Clement -Sure.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- you agree that if

2

the word "full" wasn't in the statute you would

3

lose?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Okay.

So we -- we

6

decided a case earlier this year on the basis

7

of the legal proposition that adjectives modify

8

nouns.

9

In other words, "full" can only modify costs as

10
11

Why doesn't that kill you in this case?

defined in 1920.
MR. CLEMENT:

So I think that case

12

helps us because it shows that you look at both

13

the adjective and the noun, and I think what

14

the Court didn't have to say there but is

15

absolutely true is sometimes the adjective

16

tells you how the noun is being used.

17

Just to illustrate that the adjective

18

can make a big difference, if you think about

19

the Weyerhaeuser case, and the adjective wasn't

20

critical but was potential, potential habitat,

21

I mean, habitat would still have a meaning, but

22

I think the case would be very different.

23

But I think what's more telling here

24

is I think what the dispute here is we say that

25

Congress in 1831, in 1909, in 1976 used the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

phrase "full costs" capaciously and used the

2

word "costs" in its ordinary meaning.

3

My friends on the other side say, no,

4

"cost" was being used in a term of art sense.

5

I think you look to the adjective in this case

6

to tell you which of us is right.

7

And I think there are --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

But that's a strange

kind of thing, because you -- we started, you

10

said, if it just said cost, we would all

11

understand that it was the term of art in 1920

12

costs.

13

And then you say that by adding the

14

word "full," rather than to say, look, it

15

really is the full amount of the 1920 costs,

16

don't try slicing and dicing the 1920 costs,

17

rather, you want to use the word "full" to

18

suggest that it's not the 1920 costs we're

19

talking about at all.

20

of costs.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

It's some different kind

And I don't think that's

22

strange at all, because it's not like some

23

radically different kind of cost.

24

ordinary meaning of costs.

25

Congress had used the, I would have thought

It's the

And imagine if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

until I got involved in this case, narrower

2

phrase, non-taxable costs.

3

Now, if Congress had expressly

4

provided for the recovery of non-taxable costs,

5

I would think to a moral certainty that would

6

tell you that Congress is using the word

7

"costs" not in the term of art sense of taxable

8

costs, because I can't imagine Congress meant

9

to say non-taxable taxable costs.

10

It would be a strong indication that

11

Congress used "cost" in its ordinary sense.

12

I think "full" does the exact same

13

thing.

14

what you're really talking about here is a

15

choice between an ordinary meaning that's

16

broader and a term of art meaning that's

17

narrower.

18

And I think, think about it this way:

When Congress uses the phrase with the

19

modifier "full," I sure would have thought

20

that's an indication that Congress means to

21

adopt the broader reading and not the narrow

22

reading that is the term of art.

23

And I think if you look at this from

24

every relevant historical standpoint, which I

25

think is 1831, 1909, and 1976, it all points

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

you in favor of the ordinary meaning

2

construction of costs.

3

So, in 1831, the one thing we ought to

4

be able to agree on is Congress was not using

5

costs in 1831 in a narrow sense to refer to

6

some other federal statute that provided a

7

schedule of fees, because there wasn't one for

8

another 20 years.

9

So I assume, consistent with this

10

Court's cases, that when Congress used the term

11

"full costs" in 1831, it was using it in its

12

ordinary meaning, which would have covered all

13

of the costs of litigation, and my friend's

14

efforts to superimpose a narrow party-to-party

15

costs framing on that is simply not borne out

16

by the historical practice, as that Ferrett

17

case shows, and I know it's not a lot, but it's

18

all anybody has.

19

So I think it is clear that, between

20

1831 and 1853, ordinary costs was -- rather,

21

"full cost" was being construed in its ordinary

22

meaning way.

23

Then we get to 1909, a major revision

24

of the statute.

25

same term.

Congress carries forward the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

I understand this Court's basic rule

2

to be that when Congress carries forward the

3

same term, without making any change in it, it

4

still has its meaning from 1831.

5

does do something interesting in 1909.

But Congress

6

It uses in the same statute the word

7

"taxable costs" and the word "full costs," or

8

the phrase "full costs."

9

them in contradistinction.

And I think it uses
Certainly, every

10

principle of statutory construction says that

11

when Congress uses different words in the same

12

statute, you try to find different meanings for

13

them.

14

And, here, I think that basic rule is

15

reinforced because Congress uses the phrase

16

"taxable costs" in a very narrow context for

17

the recovery of certain royalties, and then it

18

makes those taxable costs recovery

19

discretionary.

20

For every other claim under the

21

statute, tax recovery is mandatory and Congress

22

uses the term "full costs."

23

look at it in 1909, you would also give it an

24

ordinary meaning construction.

25

think that Congress was using costs not as a

So I think, if you

You would also

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

term of art but as a broad, ordinary

2

construction phrase.

3

And then we come to 1976, where my

4

friends in the SG's office have to admit that

5

by making cost recovery discretionary, full

6

cost recovery discretionary, then Congress was

7

essentially under their view rendering the word

8

"full" completely superfluous.

9

And it seems to me, again, if you -- I

10

think the first principle would be, since

11

they're using the same phrase, you go back to

12

the 1831 original public meaning.

13

you look at 1976, I think what you would see

14

there is, in a choice between interpreting

15

costs in the ordinary meaning way and using

16

costs in a term of art way, it is precisely

17

because they want to use terms of -- cost in

18

the term of art sense that they render "full"

19

superfluous, where, if you continue as a

20

constant thread to say "cost" means the

21

ordinary meaning of costs, then "full" is not

22

superfluous.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But even if

They say that your

24

argument makes the second sentence of 505

25

superfluous.

Your response?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

MR. CLEMENT:

So I have two basic

2

responses.

3

is the argument that, given the American rule

4

and the fact that it took the kind of currency

5

it did, I think, a congressional staffer would

6

be well advised to tell their boss, I think you

7

ought to put in something specific about

8

attorneys' fees here.

9

One you've seen in the brief, which

But I have another argument which I

10

think at the end of the day for the textualists

11

ought to be more compelling, which is at no

12

time in history was the second sentence of the

13

Copyright Act fees provision, in fact,

14

superfluous.

15

So the first relevant period is 1909

16

to 1976, and as my friend from the SG's office

17

points out, in that period, full cost recovery

18

is mandatory, but attorneys' fee recovery is

19

discretionary.

20

not to address attorneys' fees separately if

21

they want to accomplish the goal of keeping

22

attorneys' fees awards discretionary.

23

So there's no way for Congress

Then you come to the period 1976 to

24

the present, and then it is also true at that

25

point both awards become discretionary, but the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

reason the second sentence still isn't

2

superfluous is the first couple of words in the

3

second sentence, "except as otherwise provided

4

by this title."

5

And those words are a signal and

6

respectfully a cross-reference to Section 412.

7

And I think last week you had a case about

8

registration of copyrights.

9

says that if you don't timely register your

And 412 basically

10

copyright, you don't get certain remedies under

11

the Act, specifically statutory damages and

12

attorneys' fees, but you still get your full

13

costs.

14

So, even after 1976, Congress had a

15

very good reason to treat attorneys' fees

16

differently from costs.

17

construction of the statute, not one word of

18

the statute is superfluous.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, under our

What do you say to,

20

is there -- is there anything that will help

21

me, and I might be unique in this, but I -- I

22

often think that Congress when it uses these

23

words doesn't really think about it.

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

They -- they go up to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

the drafting section, there is a drafting

2

section, and you'll get a young man or woman

3

there who has to write a very complicated

4

statute, and -- and they might use words they

5

don't really think about.

6
7
8

And so I look to a lot of other
things, as in Murphy.

All right.

Now the Copyright Act of '76 has an

9

enormous history, volume after volume, and my

10

guess is you looked through that, or you had

11

somebody look through it.

12

anything that helps you, or that hurts you if

13

you want to say, in -- in that long, long

14

history of the '76 reform?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

And is there

So, Justice Breyer, I

16

didn't see anything there that I found

17

particularly helpful.

18

some of the 1984 legislative history.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

I mean, all right.

21

brief, I think.

22

I do want to talk about

But I'm more -- I --

The '84 year is in your

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, and it's really

23

quite terrific, I think, for those that look at

24

that sort of thing.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

All right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

I'll look at that.

I'll look at that.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, no, because -- and

4

-- and -- and so let me say two things about

5

that.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

I -- I'll just explain

8

to you, Justice Breyer, why I -- I confirm that

9

there was nothing particularly helpful.

10
11

So the 1976 act is a soup-to-nuts
reform of the Copyright Act.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

And there's not a lot of

14

focus on what became Section 505 as to either

15

attorneys' fees or costs.

16

anybody's thinking really any deep thoughts

17

about Section 505, it's the fact that you're

18

sort of moving from mandatory fees --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

And the only time

Uh-huh.

-- to discretionary

21

fees, but mostly they're talking about the

22

attorneys' fees.

23

little focus at all on the question of fees,

24

which is why I think, especially for the

25

textualists, you would think that what happens

So there's just really very

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

in 1976 is they use the same terms and you

2

continue to go back to the 1831 original public

3

meaning, which couldn't possibly be a

4

cross-reference to a fee act that doesn't exist

5

for 22 years.

6

But, as to the 1984 legislative

7

history, the reason I think this is compelling

8

even to those that don't generally look at

9

legislative history is because think about what

10

the senator there is doing in expressing the

11

views of the committee.

12

The committee, if you believe

13

legislative history at all, very much wants to

14

provide for the recovery of "investigatory

15

fees," is the term he uses.

16

make sure that those are shifted to the

17

prevailing party, and they think to themselves:

18

Are they covered by the language we've used?

19

And the language they've used is "full costs."

20

And the senator concludes, duh, of course

21

they're covered.

22

How can they possibly not be covered?

23

Now they want to

We're using "full costs."

Now I suppose the senator could have

24

said:

Well, I don't know, maybe somebody's

25

going to come up with this crazy idea that it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

a term of art and it doesn't provide for this.

2

So to make sure they're provided --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

Yeah.

-- I'm going to use a

much narrower term, "investigatory costs."

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well,

7

I'll look at that.

8

Suppose I think -- now I think -- I read that

9

and I say yeah, good point.

10

But suppose you're right.

All right.

I made that kind of point in Murphy,

11

and I -- I said let's look at what Congress

12

wanted.

13

But, unfortunately, it wasn't fabulous enough

14

because I was writing a dissent.

And I had a -- I thought fabulous.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right?

Now

17

suppose -- and, after all, Murphy involved

18

getting expert fees for the parents of

19

handicapped children when, in fact, they,

20

through the hiring of necessary experts, win.

21

But the majority said in that case:

22

don't get their attorneys' fees.

23

So am I stuck with that?

No, they

You say no?

24

Well, well, well, this is a general problem, go

25

back to your lengthy career.

When do I say,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

well, I lost; I lost in the consideration of

2

the -- of that, so how long do I keep -- what

3

rule do I follow?

4

And how long do I keep referring to a

5

dissenting approach or view when others think

6

the contrary?

7
8
9

What approach do I take?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer,

far be it from me to give you career advice -(Laughter.)

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12
13

-- but I would think -No, no, that's what

I'm asking for.
MR. CLEMENT:

I would think that the

14

one thing you never -- you never abandon, just

15

because you're in the dissent, is your basic

16

approach to statutory construction.

17

Justice Scalia, God rest his soul, was in

18

dissent in a lot of cases, insisting on the

19

plain meaning.

20

said, well, I'm tired; I'm going to look at the

21

legislative history this time around.

I mean,

He never turned around and

22

So that would be my -- my sort of --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Pity.

And that would be --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

that would be my -- that would be my career

2

advice on that, but I would -- I would say I

3

don't think you're bound for at least two very

4

important reasons.

5

I mean, one is that -- and -- and

6

Justice Ginsburg separately wrote a concurrence

7

in the judgment to express her disagreement

8

with this point, but the Court in Murphy, in

9

agreement with the brief of the Solicitor

10

General, applied a clear statement rule because

11

it was a spending power case.

12

And this is not a spending power case.

13

So, if you were inclined to find a distinction

14

from Murphy, I think most of your textualist

15

colleagues would say:

16

never going to overcome a clear statement test,

17

ever.

Legislative history is

18

But, you know, some of them, not all

19

of them, but some of them will take a peek at

20

the legislative history when you're not dealing

21

with a clear statement rule; you're just trying

22

to get the best meaning of the statute,

23

particularly when the legislative history

24

supports a ruling or a reading of the statute

25

that avoids rendering an important part of it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1
2

superfluous.
So I think you could distinguish

3

Murphy on that ground, but I also want to say

4

that we don't take issue with Murphy when it's

5

dealing with the word "costs" unmodified, and

6

that is a very familiar formulation.

7

only found five statutes that use "costs"

8

modified by "full," and we think, in those

9

statutes, it would be against all your basic

We've

10

principles of statutory construction to not at

11

least look at the word "full" long enough to

12

look at whether it tells you something about

13

whether Congress is using "costs" in a

14

term-of-art way or an ordinary meaning way.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Clement, I --

And we think it

17

powerfully suggests that it's using it in an

18

ordinary meaning way.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I look at history

20

completely, which means I look at how court of

21

appeals and district courts have been using

22

those terms now for decades.

23

So the question is, where does that go

24

into your analysis?

Because it's contrary --

25

up until the Ninth Circuit, it's basically

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

contrary to your point.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I don't think

3

so, Justice Sotomayor.

4

think it would be really helpful if there were

5

like an 18th Century or a 19th Century case

6

that involved an application for ye olde

7

expert's expert fees and we had a case that

8

specifically said, yes, it's in or, no, it's

9

out.

10

I mean, as I say, I

But we don't have that case.

11

has that case.

12

informative case we have is Ferrett.

13

Ferrett --

14

Nobody

I think the single most

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

It's not because

15

you told me you don't know what the New York

16

statute permitted or didn't.

17

mind, a wash.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

So it's, in my

No, I don't think it's a

19

wash, and I think it's not a wash for two

20

reasons.

21

that, at bare minimum, Justice Nelson consulted

22

Circuit Rule 27, which is a federal circuit

23

rule.

24

only to state law.

25

It's not a wash because we do know

So it was not the case that he looked

And that conclusion is reinforced, of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

course, by the fact that Congress, both before

2

1831 and after, knew how to tell federal courts

3

to look exclusively to the state law rule, and

4

it didn't use that formulation in the Copyright

5

Act.

6
7
8
9
10

But here's the second reason it's not
a wash -JUSTICE ALITO:

What did the -- what

did the circuit rule say?
MR. CLEMENT:

The circuit rule said --

11

I think it was a provision that was relevant to

12

this 11 versus 1 issue.

13

like a lot of guidance to this question, but --

14

so it's -- it's mostly relevant because it

15

looked to federal law.

16

So it didn't provide

But the second point that I think is

17

why it's not a wash is my friends in their

18

brief make a big deal out of the fact that --

19

that "full costs" has never meant anything more

20

than party-to-party costs.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we know in

22

American history that attorneys' fees were

23

considered recoverable for a long time.

24

modern phenomenon, the American rule now.

25

It's a

So I'm not sure what to do in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

in-between period, other than to look at what

2

more recent courts are doing or not doing.

3
4

MR. CLEMENT:
there --

5
6

Well, but -- but

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was it 1976 --

what were the courts doing in 1976?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, 1976 -- you know,

8

it's -- it's really a couple years after the

9

'70 -- I don't think we have any good history

10

in 1974 and 1975.

11

case where they said definitely expert fees or

12

e-discovery, which they didn't have in 1974.

13
14
15
16
17

Like I said, we don't have a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then let me -- let

me -MR. CLEMENT:

But they don't have the

other case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- get to my

18

problem with your interpretation.

It's

19

open-ended, so open-ended that I don't have a

20

way for judges to exercise their discretion in

21

a reasonable manner because, under your

22

definition of "full costs," I'm assuming the

23

babysitter for the witness who has to come to

24

court is covered.

25

could include experts like a body language

I'm assuming experts, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

reader.

2

What -- what would limit -- there's

3

nothing statutorily or otherwise that would

4

limit a judge's discretion of awarding costs.

5

If they were caused by the suit, then,

6

presumably, they're recoverable.

7

not how we generally deal with costs.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

But that's

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

that's not a problem that's unique to my

10

construction.

11

able to deal with that problem under statutory

12

provisions.

13

for example, that provide for all expenses of

14

the litigation.

15

have to, in interpreting "all expenses," make a

16

determination about whether you need receipts

17

and things like that in order to get your

18

expenses recovered.

19

And I think courts have been

There are statutory provisions,

So the courts are going to

Rule 23(h) of the Federal Rules of

20

Civil Procedure expressly provides for the

21

recovery of non-taxable costs in the class

22

action context.

23

with rules about what counts as a non-taxable

24

cost.

25

to come up with workable rules, and it hasn't

And courts have had to come up

And in that context, they have been able

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

proven too much of a problem.

And --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

the -- what if the objection is that the

4

attorneys' fees were outrageous considering how

5

much was at stake in the case?

6

when he's dealing with a provision about full

7

costs, say, well, but that's just -- these fees

8

are outrageous; I'm only going to give you half

9

of your attorneys' fees?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, what if

Can the judge,

Absolutely, Your Honor,

11

and that's where discretion comes in.

12

may have not have been a possibility before

13

1976, but now that you have discretionary

14

awards for full costs, the judge's discretion

15

can take care of all of those things, and they

16

can make that judgment either based on the fact

17

that I think this was too expensive in the

18

context of this case, I don't think that was

19

really necessary, I don't think you've

20

documented that enough.

21

So that

And in this case in particular, you

22

see that in action where the district court

23

judge -- although I think he was quite

24

sympathetic for the fact that the litigation

25

conduct on the other side had caused our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

expenses to balloon, nonetheless, the district

2

court judge said, well, I'm going to give you

3

75 percent of your non-taxable costs.

4

So I think that discretion is another

5

part of this administrability answer, but I

6

also think it's important to recognize that

7

there are statutes that say things like all

8

expenses or non-taxable costs, so courts are

9

going to have to figure out rules to deal with

10

that.

11

There's, in fact --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

I'm not following.

14

really mean "full costs"?

15

Well, I guess

So "full costs" doesn't

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I think that the --

16

that what I would say is I think the district

17

court judge starts with the universe of full

18

costs, and then can use their discretion to

19

sort of carve that back if they think that

20

that's appropriate.

21

I also think that even in the ordinary

22

meaning of costs, I think it would be perfectly

23

appropriate for a court to say:

24

can't even document this thing, I'm not going

25

to treat that as a cost for purposes of this.

Look, if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

Whether they do it under a definition of costs

2

under its ordinary meaning or as an exercise of

3

discretion, I don't think it makes a great deal

4

of difference.

5

Now there's another provision out

6

there I alluded to that involves all expenses

7

and it says all expenses of the proceedings can

8

be recovered.

9

States Government is filing a cert petition in

Interestingly enough, the United

10

a case involving that statute called NantKwest.

11

And in that cert petition, here's what

12

they have to say about the modifier "all."

13

They say, "The modifier "all" in Section 145

14

refutes any inference that Congress intended

15

Section 145 plaintiffs to be liable only for a

16

subset of the agency's expenses."

17

Now I couldn't agree more.

I don't

18

know why they're not on our side of this case.

19

But I couldn't agree more that a word like

20

"all" or a word like "full" is a clear textual

21

indicator that Congress does not want you to

22

look to a subset of costs or expenses, whatever

23

the case may be.

24

And I think, in an odd way, the fact

25

that we all understand that taxable costs are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

just a subset of the ordinary meaning of costs

2

actually helps reinforce the idea that full

3

costs means something more than the subset.

4

I mean, I think if you think of a word

5

like full membership, well, full membership

6

probably means full membership, but if it's

7

used in contradistinction to observer status or

8

provisional membership, you absolutely know you

9

mean the whole thing.

10

In the same way, the reference to

11

"full cost," precisely because there is a

12

universe of taxable costs out there, is a

13

reference to both taxable and non-taxable

14

costs.

15

I mean, another way of thinking about

16

this is we all refer to 1920 as taxable costs,

17

but we could equally and accurately refer to it

18

as partial costs.

19

matter, a default matter under 1920 you get

20

your full costs.

21

Nobody thinks, as a normal

But, when Congress in its particular

22

context and then in four subsequent statutes

23

says "full costs," you think, ahh, you get more

24

than your partial costs under Section 1920.

25

Seems like a logical way to interpret the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

statute that renders no word in the statute

2

superfluous.

3

And I do think the superfluity problem

4

here is really quite extraordinary.

5

sure I've come across one where the contrary

6

interpretation would render more things

7

superfluous.

It really is the whole first sentence of

9

Section 505.

10

I'm not

It's not just the word "full."

It would have -- you'd have the same

11

cost recovery rule if the first sentence of

12

Section 505 weren't there, with the only

13

possible exception, ironically being enough,

14

that you might -- if Section 505 was not there,

15

you might be able to get costs against the

16

government, which you can't get under the terms

17

of Section 505.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, haven't we said

we expect redundancy in these kind of statutes?
MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't think that

21

you have said that.

I think what you have said

22

is that, you know, that when there's a variety

23

of formulations, and we expect a certain amount

24

of sort of, we're going to kind of construe

25

them to be more or less the same.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

But I don't think you've ever

2

confronted a statute like this where "cost" was

3

modified by something like "full" and the

4

consequence would be that you would render that

5

term absolutely superfluous.

6

And I think the costs for the basic

7

process of statutory interpretation and what

8

Congress is supposed to do in light of these

9

courts' cases would really suffer as a result.

10

I mean, you go back to the plight of

11

Congress in 1984.

12

for the recovery of investigatory costs.

13

look at the ordinary meaning of the English

14

language and they say, have we done it with

15

"full costs"?

16

They're trying to provide
They

I don't think anybody would tell them,

17

unless they really had this embedded term of

18

art meaning that overcame everything, including

19

words that are superfluous, would say:

20

know, I don't think full costs does it for

21

investigatory costs.

22

No, you

And, of course, the oddity would be

23

that if the committee in 1984 instead of using

24

the term "full costs" had used the term

25

"investigatory costs," then the investigatory

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

costs would be recoverable, even though they

2

wouldn't be recoverable under full.

3

In other words, you'd be telling

4

Congress:

5

authorize broader cost recovery.

6

use a --

7

If you use a narrower term, you can

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But if you

You still have --

8

-- you still have the superfluity in the second

9

sentence.

And you -- and you said that, well,

10

maybe a staffer would say let's put that in

11

there just to be sure.

12

But that's still redundant under your

13

interpretation, right, the second sentence, in

14

part?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's not, Your

16

Honor, because I don't see how you don't have

17

that second sentence if you want -- if what you

18

want to do is indicate that the authorization

19

for discretionary attorneys' fees in the second

20

sentence doesn't trump Section 412's provision

21

that says if you don't timely register, then

22

you don't get your attorneys' fees.

23

And, of course, 412 treats costs

24

differently, so they needed two sentences.

25

so I don't think under our view anything is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

rendered superfluous, but in their view, it's

2

the word "full," it's the first full sentence

3

of Section 505, and it's three of the four

4

statutes that use "full cost" and use it in a

5

discretionary sense.

6

That's a lot of wreckage and carnage

7

for ignoring the plain meaning of a statute.

8

And I think the far better course is --

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

There's a lot of

10

redundancy, as you well know, in the U.S. Code,

11

though.

12

Breyer's point, when Congress is drafting

13

statutes, there is a lot of redundancy because

14

people speak redundantly or sometimes because

15

Congress just wants to make doubly sure.

16

And when Congress -- to Justice

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, but, Justice

17

Kavanaugh, there's a difference.

18

uses --

19
20
21
22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
that it's carnage.

So I don't know

It's just --

MR. CLEMENT:

But, no, but here's

where there is --

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

When Congress

Yeah.

This is the difference.

And this is what makes it carnage.

When --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

when Congress uses -- you know, the common

2

place for redundancy is when Congress uses a

3

phrase like a series of phrases and they're

4

covering things that are clearly duplicative.

5

And I suppose in an ordinary meaning

6

way, costs and expenses might be an example of

7

that.

8

phrase like costs and expenses, you'd still

9

want to struggle against rendering them

Now I think, when you run across a

10

completely superfluous.

11

you do is you'd say, oh, the neighboring word

12

"expenses" tells me that "cost" there is being

13

used as a term of art.

14

And one of the things

But I think it's very different.

And

15

Justice Scalia makes exactly this point in his

16

book on reading law about the rule against

17

superfluity where it's really -- there really

18

is carnage is when there's an important word

19

that's in the statute that is a modifier that's

20

just inconvenient for the judges.

21

And they just ignore that word, even

22

though it's there.

And that's what I think is

23

carnage.

24

real life when a Senate committee is

25

confronting a very specific question about

And you see this again in real -- in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

whether they have to do anything more to

2

authorize the shifting of investigatory costs,

3

and they look at the English language, they

4

look at the word "full costs," and they think

5

we have this covered.

6

And, again, I think sending the

7

message that the only way they could have

8

gotten broader cost recovery is by using a

9

narrower term is really to put us way down the

10

rabbit hole and to confuse Congress and give

11

them the wrong lessons.

12

Last thing I want to say before I sit

13

down, if I may, is my friends on the other side

14

at various points said, you know, Murphy was a

15

clear signal to Congress that you have to use

16

magic words.

17

tell Congress in 1831 that they had to

18

anticipate the Murphy decision.

19

I think it's pretty tough luck to

And I do think at the end of the day

the original public meaning of "full costs" is

21

consistent with its ordinary meaning.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3
4

MR. PERRY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Three points.

5

Under the construction just proposed,

6

expert witness fees were mandatory in every

7

copyright case from 1831 to 1976.

8

witness fees were actually awarded in zero

9

copyright cases from 1831 to 1976.

Expert

I will

10

leave the Court to draw its own conclusion from

11

that fact.

12

Second, when we get to 1976, Justice

13

Breyer, you asked about the legislative history

14

of this statute.

15

some other statute, but this statute, there is

16

legislative history.

17

My friend talked a lot about

It's quoted in the government's brief

18

at page 27.

19

copyrights submission on costs, which said

20

costs in copyright cases are relatively small

21

because, of course, they don't include expert

22

witness fees or e-discovery costs or anything

23

else.

24
25

It's from the registrar of

And the court -- and the Congress
accepted the copyright registrar's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

recommendation to make them discretionary

2

rather than mandatory.

3

And that date, 1976, is critical

4

because 1975 was a watershed moment in the --

5

in the area we're talking about.

6

Alyeska decision, Your Honor, where this Court

7

dealt with fees and costs and expenses and said

8

we, the Supreme Court, are going to get out of

9

the business of -- of rewriting the rules in

10

That was the

every case.

11

We're going to get out of the business

12

of tinkering around, and we're going to adopt a

13

clear statement rule and make Congress do it in

14

case after case.

15

And that was 1975 in Alyeska.

And in 1976, the same day that

16

Section 505 was enacted, Congress enacted four

17

other statutes that expressly authorized expert

18

witness fees.

19

So it knows how to put them in.

And that's cited, by the way, in the

20

Casey case at page 88, goes through all of that

21

history.

22

and Crawford Fitting, my friend said it's a

23

crazy idea to have a -- have a -- have a term

24

of art.

25

of art.

And -- and Casey and Murphy and --

Well, this Court has said it's a term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

If it's a crazy idea, it's the
majority opinion.

3
4

What we just heard is a full half
hour -- and I use that word advisedly --

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. PERRY:

-- of -- of -- of a

7

dramatic reading of the dissents from Justice

8

Marshall in Alyeska, from Justice Marshall in

9

Crawford Fitting, from Justice Stevens in

10

Casey, and with all respect to Justice Breyer's

11

career aspirations, Justice Breyer in -- in

12

Murphy.

13

But the majority in every one of those

14

cases said cost is a term of art, and there is

15

a clear statement rule.

16

override it by stating explicitly.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And Congress can

Mr. -- Mr. Clement

18

gave us a -- a fuller reading of the Ferrett

19

case.

20

explanation --

And do you have -- do you have an

21

MR. PERRY:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23
24
25

I do.
-- for how Justice

Nelson awarded attorneys' fees there?
MR. PERRY:

I do -- I do, Your Honor.

The Ferrett case was decided under New York

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

law, and certain attorneys' fees were on the

2

New York fee schedule, as we point out in our

3

brief.

4

revised statute, but we cite that in our brief.

5

I believe it's Section 25 of the

And our point has not been that

6

attorneys' fees were never awarded.

It's that

7

non-scheduled fees were never included in full

8

costs.

9

period those scheduled fees under state fee

Full costs included during the state

10

bills, which occasionally awarded small

11

attorneys' fees, for example, $2.50 for a

12

deposition.

13

And that's what the Ferrett case

14

involved, was New York scheduled attorneys'

15

fees.

16
17

What no schedule, as Mr. Kedem pointed
out --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

-- why did they use the federal rule?

20

MR. PERRY:

Why did they use

Your Honor, I don't know

21

either.

I -- I -- I think it had -- did have

22

something to do with this 11 versus 1 and

23

whether it was a multiplicity thing.

24

nothing to do, I don't believe, with the

25

question in this case, which is the measure of

It had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the costs was made by the New York fee bill.

2

And then, in 1853, of course, we had

3

the U.S. fee bill.

4

It said the courts of the United States are

5

only authorized to award the federal schedule.

6

It wiped out all of that.

So we had a reset in 1853.

Then we

7

had another reset in 1976, or '75, with -- with

8

Alyeska.

9

with a quote from Alyeska because it speaks to

10

And I will leave the Court, if I may,

this case dramatically.

421 U.S. at 271.

"It is not for this

12

Court to invade the legislature's province by

13

redistributing litigation costs in the manner

14

suggested by Respondents and followed by the

15

court of appeals."

16
17

This judgment should be reversed, and
we can move on.
