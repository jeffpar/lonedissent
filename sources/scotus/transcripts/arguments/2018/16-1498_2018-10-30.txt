CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 16-1498,

5

Washington State Department of Licensing versus

6

Cougar Den.

7

Mr. Purcell.

8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOAH PURCELL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. PURCELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Washington's fuel tax taxes fuel, not

13

highway travel.

The tax is non-discriminatory

14

and its incidence is off-reservation, so it

15

applies to Cougar Den unless preempted by

16

express federal law.

17

treaty preempts this tax.

18

guarantees the tribe the right in common with

19

others to travel by public highway, but it says

20

nothing that would preempt a generally

21

applicable tax on goods like this one.

Nothing in the Yakama
The treaty

22

The contract -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. PURCELL:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Could you tell me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

could you tax the tribe's buying of the fuel in

2

another state?

3

MR. PURCELL:

Well, the treaty -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They take the

5

truck, they leave your state, they go to

6

another state, they buy the fuel.

7

them in the buying of that fuel?

8
9

MR. PURCELL:

Can you tax

The other state could

certainly tax them on that, Your Honor.

10

They've conceded that.

Whether we could tax

11

them as a matter of state law, I don't think

12

so, but -- but -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. PURCELL:

15

not under the treaty.

16

All right.

-- but not -- certainly

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the question

17

is, in my mind, whether the travel rights to

18

freely use the highways permit you to tax them

19

for an incidence carrying the fuel from another

20

state on a highway through your state, correct?

21

Now the court below called this an importation

22

tax.

23

MR. PURCELL:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Right.
You've been

resisting that, and you call it a use tax.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

MR. PURCELL:

Right.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, if it's an

3

importation tax, it's not equally applied.

4

There are wholesalers of all kind who can

5

import without paying the tax, correct?

6

MR. PURCELL:

Not if they lack a

7

license like Cougar Den, Your Honor.

An

8

unlicensed entity owes the tax when they bring

9

the fuel into the state regardless of how they

10

do so, and licensed entities that buy fuel in

11

the state pay the tax immediately within the

12

state.

13

in Washington or outside of Washington and -­

So this tax applies to fuel purchased

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the -- the

15

license?

16

Who pays for the fuel then once you're

17

licensed?

18

in, I'm assuming by vessel or by pipeline.

19
20
21
22
23

Is it a way to get them not to pay?

You're a wholesaler, you bring it

MR. PURCELL:

Well, then -- sorry.

Sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then the person

who buys the fuel uses it, correct?
MR. PURCELL:

Well, if you're bringing

24

it into a terminal or refinery, then -- then

25

the tax is due when it's picked up at a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

terminal or a refinery.

Who actually pays the

2

tax is a complicated question depending on

3

whether the entity that owns the fuel in the

4

tank is a supplier or not.

5

But that's when the tax is due.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we accept that

7

the travel provision entitled this tribe to

8

travel with goods back and forth to a market

9

without a tax, without a license, just like in

10

the fishing rights case, then what gives you

11

the right to charge them within the state?

12

Meaning they're traveling free of tax, free of

13

license, they go to the reservation, you can't

14

tax them on the reservation.

15

MR. PURCELL:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17
18
19
20
21

Right.
So I'm not quite

sure what permits you to tax them at all.
MR. PURCELL:

Well, there's two

crucial -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you can't tax

them when they picked up the fuel.

22

MR. PURCELL:

There's two crucial

23

points about that, Your Honor.

24

Cougar Den concedes that we could tax a

25

purchase or sale that a Yakama member makes

First of all,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

outside of the reservation, even though that

2

would not have been taxed in 1855.

3

doing the work -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. PURCELL:

6
7

What's

At the market.

At the market, yes, but

-- but -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you've just

8

admitted that at the market where they pick

9

this up, you couldn't tax them.

10

MR. PURCELL:

Well, the point is, Your

11

Honor, the treaty did not preserve everything

12

exactly as it was in 1855.

13

is that this Court has adopted a clear rule

14

that as to off-reservation taxes,

15

off-reservation state taxes can be applied to

16

tribes if -- if they're non-discriminatory and

17

-- and if the incidence is off-reservation.

18

And, here, that's the case, so -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The key point here

Mr. Purcell -­
Well, that -­

-- there are a lot of

22

issues in this case, but just to make it easier

23

for me, could I ask you to assume a couple of

24

them and then could -- we could focus on one?

25

MR. PURCELL:

Sure.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you know one issue

2

is does the right to travel include the right

3

to travel with goods, and I'm going to ask you

4

to just assume that it does.

5

MR. PURCELL:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.
And then another

7

question is, does this treaty preempt generally

8

applicable taxes?

9

been talking a lot about that.

10

And I'm -- that's -- you've
And I'm just

going to ask you to assume that it does.

11

MR. PURCELL:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.
In other words, you

13

know, if -- if -- if you have a toll on a road,

14

for example, the fact that it's generally

15

applicable, you still can't apply it to members

16

of the Yakama Nation.

17

you -­

18

MR. PURCELL:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm just going to ask

20

Okay.
-- to assume that,

okay?

21

MR. PURCELL:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
So, if both of those

23

things are true, then it seems to me we come -­

24

to me, the hardest issue, which is how do we

25

look at this tax?

Do we look at it as a tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

that is preventing the Yakama from doing

2

exactly what they bargained for in this treaty;

3

in other words, it -- you know, it's not

4

preventing but burdening the Yakama from

5

traveling on roads with goods, or you keep on

6

saying, well, no, because it's not targeted at

7

that.

8

broad tax on the possession of fuel.

9

It's not directed at that.

It's a more

And I guess what I want to ask you is

10

why that matters.

11

to me that from the Yakama's point of view, and

12

they're, after all, the people who entered into

13

the treaty, from the Yakama's point of view,

14

this tax is burdening exactly what they

15

bargained to get, which is the ability to

16

transport their goods without any burdens,

17

without a tax.

18

I mean, it -- it does seem

MR. PURCELL:

No, Your Honor.

This

19

tax applies to the fuel itself regardless of

20

whether or how it's transported.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know -- maybe I'm

22

not making myself clear.

You're sort of

23

saying, well, the tax applies in other

24

circumstances to people who aren't transporting

25

fuel.

But I'm saying, from the Yakama's point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

of view, they're transporting goods on the

2

road, exactly as the treaty says they can, and

3

why do they care if you apply your tax in other

4

circumstances as well?

5

Why does it matter what the full scope of the

6

tax is if, from the Yakama's point of view, the

7

tax burdens exactly what they got as a result

8

of its treaty?

9

MR. PURCELL:

Why should they care?

Because, Your Honor,

10

this Court has never said that a person or a

11

company can make an activity exempt from state

12

law, an activity like fuel possession, by

13

engaging in that activity while also engaged in

14

a treaty-protected activity like travel.

15

If that's the rule, then a Yakama

16

member could possess illegal firearms or

17

illegal drugs or diseased apples in their car,

18

to just gave a range of examples, and bring

19

them into the state and say your laws against

20

these things violate my right to travel by

21

public highway.

22

the right approach, or else it would preempt

23

any sort of state -­

24
25

And that cannot possibly be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But even in the

fishing rights case, which you don't see as -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

as comparable, but others might argue it is,

2

the state can regulate for public interest

3

conservation points.

4

The Indian tribe has conceded that you

5

can regulate for public interest on a highway.

6

That wasn't superseded by the treaty.

7

they bargained for was to -- to carry goods

8

back and forth from the market without a

9

burden.

That was their bargain.

But what

Just as,

10

under the fishing rights treaty, they can go

11

and collect fish without paying a tax or

12

getting a license for that fish.

13

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, in Tulee,

14

this Court said that the -- the state could not

15

tax the very right at issue, the right to fish.

16

But, here, that is not at all what's happening.

17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or impose a toll

to do it.

19

MR. PURCELL:

Well, and the Court has

20

never said that the state can generally

21

regulate a fishing right in the public

22

interest.

23

regulate for the conservation of fish.

24
25

It's only said that the state can

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­

Well, that's the

public interest.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

MR. PURCELL:

Well, but -- but -- but

2

Cougar Den is seeking to expand that to say the

3

state can do anything that would protect public

4

safety.

5

about the fishing right.

6

convenient addition that they've conceded, but

7

it's not found anywhere in the treaty text.

8

And so they're -- they're essentially asking

9

this Court to -- to find kind of reasonable

And this Court has never said that
So that's sort of a

10

regulations that are okay without any basis in

11

the treaty.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, counsel, is

13

that so?

I mean, I thought the interpretation

14

of the phrase "in common with" by the district

15

court in Yakama Indian Nation was that it

16

allowed the state to impose certain regulations

17

that facilitate both native and non-native

18

travel along the same highways.

19

MR. PURCELL:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -­

That's -­
-- safety

21

regulations, speed limits, would facilitate

22

travel in common.

23

MR. PURCELL:

That's what the district

24

court held in Yakama Indian Nation.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

MR. PURCELL:

Of course, that wouldn't

2

cover something like, for example, regulating

3

firearm possession or diseased apple

4

transportation.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But it does regulate

6

the questions that we've been talking about in

7

terms of it does provide some safety

8

regulations, for example, right?

9

MR. PURCELL:

Well, presumably, that

10

would allow, for example, a speed limit but not

11

any other sort of regulation on the goods

12

themselves, which is what the state's trying to

13

do here.

14
15
16

I mean, what's odd under Cougar Den's
theory is that the state -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's all, under

17

the Yakama Indian Nation holding, that's all

18

that the treaty would allow you to do.

19

And I guess I'm wondering in the first

20

instance why -- why you're not estopped from

21

arguing a different position today?

22

MR. PURCELL:

For a number of reasons,

23

Your Honor.

First of all, this Court has

24

always treated treaty interpretation as a

25

question of law for this Court to decide de

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

novo, and that's how this Court has always

2

approached treaty interpretation.

3

It has never considered itself bound

4

by legal conclusions reached by a lower court

5

even in the same case.

6
7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
feel bound.

Well, I -- I don't

I wonder if you are, though.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. PURCELL:

No, Your Honor.

We

10

explained in our reply brief as a matter of

11

state law the argument is just completely wrong

12

that we're bound by any of those statements in

13

the ALJ's ruling or the superior court ruling.

14

But, more importantly, this Court has

15

never considered itself bound by what are

16

really legal conclusions in a district court

17

opinion.

18

And Yakama Indian Nation dealt with a

19

very narrow issue of a fee as a precondition to

20

use the highway.

21

here.

That is not what we have

22

Cougar Den and the Yakama Nation are

23

free to use the highway and not pay this tax.

24

What they can't do is possess fuel and bring it

25

into the state or purchase it in the state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

without paying the tax.

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But they were told

3

at the time of the treaty that you could go on

4

the roads to take your things to market, as if

5

you would be treated off-reservation, as if you

6

were still on the reservation.

7

MR. PURCELL:

8

told, Your Honor.

9

not.

10

The first part they were

The second part they were

That is a misquote that the other side is

using from the -- the -- the -­

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But the effect -­

12

the effect was that, in taking your goods to

13

market, which was the promise, in exchange for

14

a huge area of land, an area of land the size

15

of the State of Maryland that was given up by

16

the tribe, that you could take your goods to

17

market.

18

And this burdens, as Justice Kagan

19

said, this burdens substantially their ability

20

to take goods to market.

21

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, the Yakama

22

remain entirely free to take goods to market.

23

And Cougar Den has conceded that the state can

24

tax their -- their trading of goods

25

off-reservation, as they must.

So the idea

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

that the treaty preserved things exactly as

2

they were in 1855, and the Yakama trading

3

practices, is just impractical.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what the treaty

5

seems to present -- prevent is the state from

6

taxing either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh

7

says, travel with goods.

8
9
10

Isn't that exactly what they got in
exchange for their land?
MR. PURCELL:

No, Your Honor, the best

11

reading of the treaty is that it does not

12

preempt non-discriminatory taxes that apply

13

equally to everyone.

14

guarantees a right in common with others to

15

travel by public highway.

The treaty says it

16

And none of the reasons the Court

17

deviated from that ordinary meaning in the

18

fishing cases apply here.

19

But even if the Court decided that it

20

guaranteed the Yakama some right beyond what it

21

guaranteed others in terms of traveling without

22

paying a fee for traveling, what we have here

23

is not a fee for traveling.

24

fee does not turn -- this tax does not turn in

25

any way on use of the highway.

The -- the -- this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

It's paid on fuel purchased in state,

2

fuel purchased out of state.

3

brought this fuel into Washington and

4

immediately put it into a tank on the other

5

side of the state line, they would still owe

6

the tax even if they never traveled any

7

farther.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If Cougar Den

Well, the -- the tax

legislation taxes a wide range of activities.

10

One is it taxes fuel that's removed in the

11

state from a refinery, but the one that's being

12

applied here is that it taxes motor vehicle

13

fuel entering into this state.

14

So entering into, this is a pretty

15

standard importation tax, which is to say that

16

it's taxing the travel of goods into the state,

17

which, again, seems to be what the Yakama got

18

as a result of this treaty:

19

take goods to market and to take goods from

20

market, regardless where that market is.

21

MR. PURCELL:

the ability to

But, again, Your Honor,

22

the -- the fuel -- the tax applies to fuel

23

purchased inside Washington and outside of

24

Washington and brought into Washington by any

25

means.

2

using public highways.

3

It is not a tax on

And -- and the happenstance of where

4

the state line is was not certainly a factor in

5

the 1855 treaty negotiations.

7

What -- what Cougar Den is essentially
arguing -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you -- do you

9

contest -- I mean, if you said what is Cougar

10

Den doing, how would you describe what Cougar

11

Den is doing, what its activity is?

12

the way I would describe Cougar Den's activity

13

is that it's bringing goods from market.

14

MR. PURCELL:

15

that, Your Honor.

16

does not -­

17

Because

Well, two things about

First of all, the treaty

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I just really asked

how would you describe Cougar Den's activity.

19

MR. PURCELL:

Sorry.

I would describe

20

it as possessing fuel in Washington, Your

21

Honor.

22
23
24
25

That is why they pay the tax.
Keep in mind, Cougar Den is not even

doing the transporting here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

You would describe it

as possessing fuel as opposed to transporting

fuel?

2

MR. PURCELL:

They owe the tax because

3

they possess fuel.

4

the fuel in light of the facts of this case.

5

They are not transporting

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if Jack says I'm

6

taking my pigs to market, and somebody says,

7

what are you doing, Jack?

He says, well, I'm

8

taking my pigs to market.

No, I think you're

9

possessing your pigs, Jack.

10

MR. PURCELL:

Well, if the state had a

11

rule that diseased pigs could not leave a

12

certain area, under the -- under Crudenser, the

13

state could not apply that rule.

14

And -- and so this is a regulation of

15

the goods, a tax to the goods, not a tax on the

16

travel.

That's the crucial point here.

17

That's -- that's one of the crucial

18

points.

19

best reading of the treaty, this is a

20

non-discriminatory tax that applies to

21

everyone.

22

even if it were.

23

The other crucial point is, under the

MR. PURCELL:

It was, Your Honor, but

none of the reasons the Court gave in those

cases apply here.

three reasons.

5

So the Court really gave

And in the Tulee case, the Court said

6

it was despite the phrase "in common with

7

others" that it was going to read the fishing

8

right as creating a greater right for the

9

tribes than for non-Indians.

And there were

10

sort of historical, textual, and practical

11

reasons.

12

And the practical reason, first and

13

foremost, was an equal right would have left no

14

fish for the Indians to take because they're so

15

vastly outnumbered by non-Indians.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, we -- counsel,

19

we normally read a -- a -- a phrase to bear the

same meaning in all of its applications.

21

we wouldn't normally read the term "in common

22

23

another thing when it's highways, would we?

That would be kind of an extraordinary -­

do you think about that, though?
MR. PURCELL:

in Tulee that do not apply here.

that they would be able to do the same things

The meaning of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

Article III of the Yakama treaty does

7

not exempt tribal members from paying

8

Washington's motor fuel tax.

9

The treaty protects the right in

10

common with others to travel upon the public

11

highways.

12

immunity from excise taxes on goods that

13

they're carrying inside their trucks inside -­

14

that they're brought outside of the reservation

15

or obtained outside of the reservation for

16

trade or for any other purpose.

17

It does not give tribal members

Respondent acknowledges that tribal

18

members are not exempt from the economic

19

framework for trading goods that has developed

20

outside of the reservation.

21

If Respondent had obtained this fuel

22

from a refinery in Washington, it could be

23

taxed for that transaction.

24
25

If Oregon had charged a tax on this
transaction, the Respondent would have to pay

Official - Subject to Final Review

it.

2

Washington's tax is an -- is an

3

economic burden on the fuel that's being

4

carried in the truck.

5

on their ability to use the highway in common

6

with others.

7

It's not a restriction

JUSTICE BREYER:

Assume I think you're

8

mostly right, but what about the fact that it's

9

gasoline?

I mean, can -- can the state impose

10

tolls on -- on the highway?

11

want people to use mass transit.

12

to have a $1,000 toll.

13

MS. O'CONNELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can they do that?
The state -- well, the

17

doing that for everybody.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think that -­
Yes, doing it for

19

everybody.

20

anyone, can use the highways, including the

21

tribe.

22

Now, by the way, nobody, or hardly

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think that that

23

hypothetical is quite unlikely simply because

24

the -- there's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I believe that they

MS. O'CONNELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, everyone has

There's -- there's an

antidiscrimination rule built into -­

That's why it's a

Right.

So I guess -­

Including the tribe.

And then, if you were going to say they can do

10

that, I really do find it difficult to

11

distinguish this issue.

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

13

There -- there could

be some restrictions, Justice Breyer, like -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

There could?
-- if you imposed a,

16

you know, a million dollar tax on everybody's

17

use -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, it's $1,000,

19

and, of course, as soon as you agree to that,

20

I'm going to say it's only 50, and then I'm

21

going to say it's 10.

22

MS. O'CONNELL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And then, when I'm

24

driving up, I would have thought they can't do

25

that, but if they can't do that, this is

gasoline.

2

and California and other places and everybody

3

pays it, that's true, but if you pay a high

4

gasoline tax, it's pretty hard to travel.

5

And maybe all those Oregon and -­

And they're supposed to be able to

6

travel on the highway, just as if you get all

7

the salmon out of the river, it's pretty hard

8

to fish.

9

MS. O'CONNELL:

I suppose there could

10

be circumstances where the restriction that's

11

placed on travel on the highway are so severe

12

that it undermines -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Oregon, you say

14

that they have -- they cannot take steps to

15

remove significant numbers of salmon from the

16

steam -- stream, and they cannot take steps

17

sufficient to significantly limit the right to

18

travel on the highway by these people.

19

you want for the other citizens.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

Do what

So I think there's a

21

couple of distinctions that we need to -- to

22

draw between what you're hypothesizing and what

23

is happening here.

24

there could be circumstances in which the

25

restriction that's imposed is so severe that it

The first is that, yes,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27

burdens the actual ability or right to travel

2

on the highway.

But there's -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MS. O'CONNELL:

How much is the tax?
Excuse me?
How much is the tax?
Well, we don't think

7

that -- I mean, I -- I don't know.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know you don't

9

think it's relevant, but if I happened to think

10

it was relevant and asked the question how much

11

is the tax, what would the answer be?

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

I -- I don't have a -­
You don't know?
-- a number to give

15

you.

16

could determine what -- what was too burdensome

17

and actually -­

18

I think the, you know, district court

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

any of these arguments.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

But they didn't make

No, that's correct.

21

And I think the other thing is, even if you

22

thought that the treaty preempted things like

23

fees to use the highway, such as a toll or a

24

licensing fee that was issue -- at issue in

25

Cree, so you adopted the Ninth Circuit's rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

of what kinds of things are preempted, it still

2

wouldn't preempt this tax, which isn't a fee to

3

use the highway; it's a tax, an economic burden

4

on the goods that are being carried in the

5

truck.

6

The -- the text of Article III secures

7

to the -- the Yakamas only the right in common

8

with others to travel upon the public highways.

9

And that right, by its plain terms, doesn't

10

protect activities other than highway travel.

11

There's nothing in the negotiating history

12

either that indicates -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there's one

14

central part, which is they traveled the

15

18

They weren't burdened by

So we go back to Justice Breyer's

question, which is whether it's 50 cents or a

20

million dollars, you're saying if it's 50 cents

21

or 5 or 10, presumably, it's okay, you can

22

burden them with that.

25

that your point?

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I don't -- I

2

don't think the state is ever going to impose a

3

tax that is so burdensome that nobody can

4

travel on the highways, but our -- yes, we

5

believe that -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're going

7

back to the point that Justice Gorsuch ended

8

with, which is that you're reading "in common

9

with all others" differently in this context

10

than in the fishing rights context?

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

And I think the

12

reason that it's different in this context than

13

in the fishing context is because of the right

14

at issue.

15

differences and historical differences between

16

those two clauses of the treaty.

17

I think there are textual

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the one

18

difference that you can't get around is they

19

didn't sign a treaty and give away that much

20

real estate to get nothing in return, to be

21

treated exactly like every other citizen in

22

traveling the highway.

23

MS. O'CONNELL:

No, I think one -- one

24

thing that is really -- really important about

25

this right to travel provision, the right to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

use the public highways, is that the -- the

2

tribe was receiving an assurance from Governor

3

Stevens that if they gave up the rest of the

4

land in exchange for the reservation, they

5

would still be able to leave the reservation,

6

they would still be able to travel throughout

7

the area, and that they would be able to do so

8

without discrimination against them, without

9

taxes imposed or without rules imposed that

10

were unique to Indians.

11

without taxes imposed.

25

to the tribe that Governor Stevens was giving.

There are examples cited on page 38 of the

2

Petitioner's brief where, at the time, in the

3

mid-1800s, there were restrictions on tribal

4

members leaving reservations.

5

instances where people would report back to

6

Congress that the -- the Indian agent on the

7

reservation would issue a pass and tell the

8

tribal members how long they could be gone from

the reservation and for what purposes.

The purpose, as I

And if you so burden the trade, that

acknowledge that the transaction, if they

If we could go back to the fishing
cases for just a moment -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think what is at

11

issue is the transport of goods to and from the

12

market, which is what it seems the Yakama is

13

engaging in here.

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's true.

I mean,

15

they are transporting goods from market and

16

they are -- when they come back from Oregon

17

with the fuel, but that's not -- the treaty

18

just protects the right in common with others

19

to use the public highways.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if -- if I

21

disagree with you on that -- and I hadn't

22

understood that you were taking that position

23

in your brief -- but if I disagree with you on

24

that and I use -- and I understand "in common

25

with" the way Tulee understood "in common

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33

with," then it seems, well, there they are,

2

they're doing what this treaty says that the -­

3

that this -- they're doing exactly what this

4

treaty protects, which is transporting goods to

5

and from market.

6

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think that, under

7

that view, Justice Kagan, the -- the most you

8

could get is to the Ninth Circuit's line where

9

they've said that the state can't impose a fee

10

like a licensing fee or a toll or something

11

like that to use the highway, even if it's

12

being imposed across the board.

13

What's happening here is a different

14

type of restriction.

15

on the goods that are being transported to and

16

from market that the Respondent concedes it

17

could be taxed for at the -- at the purchase

18

point.

19

It's an economic burden

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But not because of the

20

-- but not at the movement point, not -- not

21

when it -- the -- the goods go from one state

22

to another on the highway.

23

MS. O'CONNELL:

Right.

But the -- the

24

distinction between those things, I think, is

25

pretty thin.

Oregon could have -- could have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

taxed this transaction.

2

Oregon, like Washington, doesn't place a tax on

3

fuel that's headed out of the state.

4

assume that it will be taxed once it gets to

5

the next state.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It doesn't because

They

Well, it might be

7

thin, but shouldn't we say that the state has

8

to do things the right way, which is to say the

9

state has to do things without violating the

10

treaty.

11

it, go for it.

12

And if the state has another way to do

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think the -- the

13

state has tried many different ways to impose

14

this tax that have been struck down by various

15

courts.

16

basically followed this Court's advice in

17

Wagnon, which is to move the incidence of the

18

tax up the supply chain to off the reservation.

19

Now -­

20

What the state has done here is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what the state has

21

done is to tax exactly the activity that's

22

protected under the treaty, which is the -­

23

which is the transportation of goods to and

24

from market.

25

MS. O'CONNELL:

I -- I don't think so.

There's -- I think there's a distinction

tribe wouldn't be subject to a uniform tax if

it taxed the very thing that they were trying

5

to preserve, which was the ability to use the

public highways, then that would just -- it

would just mean that you couldn't charge them a

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Yakama treaty preempts the

19

application of the fuel tax to Respondent for

20

two reasons.

21

Respondent transports fuel, it exercises the

22

right to travel secured by the Yakama treaty.

23

As such, it has right -- the right to do that

24

without incurring a tax obligation, regardless

25

of whether this tax is styled as one on

The first reason is that, when

possession or transportation.
Second, even if this case turned on

3

what the tax is on, this really is a tax on

4

transportation because that's what the statute

5

says and that's how the state court construed

6

it as a matter of state law.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if -- if

8

this -- these were apples coming into the State

9

of Washington and there was a fee to -- but

10

they inspected the apples to make sure they

11

weren't diseased and the people who owned the

12

apples had to pay that fee, is that problematic

13

if it wasn't motor fuel, oil, but just apples,

14

a fee to inspect the apples and prevent disease

15

from spreading to other Washington apples?

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, we

17

wouldn't object to the inspection at all.

18

-- we might object to the fee.

19

inspection is appropriate.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We

But the

Well, that's

21

kind of the -- well, in other words, everybody

22

else bringing apples in has to pay the fee to

23

inspect the apples, but the tribe doesn't, even

24

though -- or the -- the fee can't be assessed

25

if the tribe is transporting the apples?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, I think that if

2

all the tribe is doing is transporting the

3

apples, we absolutely agree the -- the apples

4

can be inspected.

5

regulatory purposes, that's fine.

6

We agree that, for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but -­

7

but no fee can be assessed if the tribe is

8

transporting the apples?

9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, I think that a

10

fee that goes into the -- you know, the general

11

treasury of the state cannot -- cannot be

12

assessed on the tribe when they're exercising

13

the treaty right.

14

But -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if the

15

apples don't belong to the tribe?

They're

16

bringing them to somebody -- you know, they're

17

just bringing them down the road?

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, it would depend

19

on who has to pay the tax.

So they're -- in

20

this particular tax, if you just appoint an

21

agent to transport it for you, you, the

22

importer who appoints the agent, pays the tax.

23

So I think that if the tax was levied on the

24

person who -- so if the taxpayer was the person

25

who owned the apples and they just hired an

No, Your Honor, what

imposed on the owner.

1

transport something for you, it makes perfect

2

sense that the state wouldn't want the trucker

3

to have to pay this tax which will probably

4

exceed the fee he's getting for transporting

5

it.

6

So the state -- the statute imputes

7

the act of transportation to the owner of the

8

fuel.

9

vehicle fuel importer.

10

That's in the definition of motor

And so, in this case, Cougar Den

11

transports the fuel both via an agent, which is

12

a contractor, and also it uses its own trucks.

13

There's a declaration in the record that says

14

that sometimes it uses its own trucks,

15

sometimes it hires a contractor, but Cougar Den

16

--

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so, if

18

it's the owner, why do you -- why does it

19

interfere with a right to travel?

20

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, it's -- it's the

21

-- it's the owner's transportation either

22

itself or via an agent.

23

distinguish, by the way, the transportation via

24

Cougar Den's own trucks and via its agent.

25

That's just the argument the state did not make

The states never

in its brief.

2

And, you know, so, ultimately, it's

3

the owner that pays the tax.

4

if you hire a trucker, that's not different

5

from just using the trucks that you own.

6

And the idea is,

The point is the sine qua non of

7

taxation under the statute is the

8

transportation of goods to market.

9

you do it with your own truck or you hire

And whether

10

someone else and a truck, it doesn't change the

11

fact that you need to pay the tax.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it make a

13

difference -- I think this is the argument on

14

the other side -- that it's assessed per

15

gallon, in other words, that suggests as

16

opposed to per mile that you're carrying it?

17

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It suggests

19

that it's -- it's based on possession if it's

20

based on right there at that moment how much do

21

you have.

22

They don't care if you use it all up right at

23

the border or -- or whatever.

24

to do with -- with travel.

25

good itself.

They don't care where it's going.

It has nothing

It's purely on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I don't agree -­

2

I don't think that you can just say a tax is on

3

a good.

4

an analysis of the precise activity engaged in

5

by the taxpayer.

6

I think this Court has always required

So the Wagnon case, the argument that

7

the tribe made in that case was that really

8

this is a tax on the fuel that's sold at

9

retail.

10

And the test this Court adopted was

11

you've got to have this focused analysis of

12

what is the taxpayer doing that triggers the

13

application of the tax.

14

And in this case, the thing that the

15

taxpayer is doing is importing the fuel.

16

its terms, the statute says that the taxable

17

event is the entry of fuel into the state, so

18

the traveling with the fuel.

19

And the taxpayer under the statute is

20

defined as the importer.

21

just has to be a tax on importation.

22

By

And so I think that

And, incidentally, it's not even just

23

that it's the importer that pays the tax.

24

25

importers between people who use highways and

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -- I'm

But what if the -- I

4

mean, what if the statute said the first entity

5

to possess the fuel in the state must pay the

6

tax?

7

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So we would still say

8

that's preempted, although our legal analysis

9

might differ a little bit.

10
11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would that be

preempted?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, first of all, I

13

think that, as applied to fuel that comes in

14

from out of state, really, first possession

15

just is inherently importation.

16

In other words, you can't be the first

17

possessor of fuel, at least that originates out

18

of state, unless you're the one hauling it into

19

the state.

20
21
22

So, in that context, I just think
first possession kind of means it.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought you

23

just said we have to focus on what the statute

24

says is being taxed, so if the statute says

25

expressly possession is being taxed, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

doesn't matter.

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Okay.

So we -- we

3

have two arguments in our brief, a broader

4

argument and a narrower argument.

5

argument actually doesn't depend on what the

6

statute says.

7

member is doing.

The broader

It depends on what the tribal

8

So, if the tribal member can show that

9

the only thing that they're doing is exercising

10

a treaty right, which is to say transporting

11

goods to market, then they don't pay the tax,

12

no matter how the statute is styled.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then that's very

14

artificial and you get into this metaphysical

15

question of what they're doing.

16

many things when they're -- you know, when the

17

farmer is bringing his pigs to market, he's

18

doing many things.

19

pigs.

20

breathing.

21

things.

22

They're doing

He's traveling with the

He's possessing the pigs.

He's

He may be doing all kinds of other

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, yeah, but I

23

think that things that are inherent in

24

transportation, like breathing while you're

25

transporting it, I think would be sort of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1
2

wrapped up in transportation.
I mean, on the facts of this case,

3

what we have here is an Indian distributor

4

transporting fuel to an Indian reservation to

5

be sold to an Indian retailer on the

6

reservation and potentially to Indian

7

customers.

8
9
10
11

Really, the only connection that
Cougar Den has off-reservation is that it's
hauling this fuel.
JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the thing I

12

don't understand is that many states have laws

13

against bringing in diseased apples, all kinds

14

of things.

15

it in, you can't transport it at all.

16

All right?

So, if they don't bring

So, if your point is that they have a

17

right to transport things, I would have thought

18

you would have said a ban was worse because -­

19

but you don't.

20

tax isn't.

21
22
23

You say a ban is okay, but a

That's your argument?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes, that is our

argument, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, if you

24

tax what they do in this state, is they have a

25

tax that says if you buy goods to use in your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

house somewhere else, you have to -- you have

2

to pay a use tax when you bring it into our

3

state.

4

And then another state says we're

5

going to legalize marijuana, but we tax it

6

pretty high, and another state says we have -­

7

you know, I can go on and on and on.

8

you're saying, well, this tribe, it doesn't

9

have to pay the tax on marijuana.

And

It doesn't

10

have to pay the ordinary sales tax, which take

11

the form of a use tax in the state.

12

could probably think of 10 other examples.

13
14

And, my goodness, I say why -- why
not?

Is that your position, what I said?

15
16
17

And I

position.

No, it is not our

I'm not saying that at all.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Good.

Now, fine.

18

I'm glad it isn't because my own position I had

19

a good argument against.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I'd like -- I'd

22

like -- like to -- I'd like to know what your

23

position is then.

24
25

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

We are not claiming

exemption from sales taxes.

We draw a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

distinction between the acquisition of

something, which is not travel, and the

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, so if you buy -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't see that in

just didn't see that in your brief that you

were saying but a tax on gas interferes with

transportation.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:
position.

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

21

Our position is not

based on the fact that it's -­

19
20

That's not your

argument either.

17
18

That -- that's not our

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

What is your

argument?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Our argument is that

22

if you buy fuel and the state imposes a sales

23

tax, as Your Honor referred to, then the

24

acquisition of a good -- it could be fuel, it

25

could be apples, it could be anything -- that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

could be taxed.

2

that's happening out of state.

3

That's not travel.

But, here,

I don't think there would be a treaty

4

problem with the taxation of that, but the

5

state hasn't tried to tax that purchase in

6

Oregon, and so that's -- that's out of the

7

case.

8

11

is taxing in the State of Washington is the
transportation.

It says entry of fuel.

of the statute?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Our position

Heritage Reporting Corporation

does not depend on the good that's being

2

imported.

3

marijuana, it would be the same thing.

4

If it's a tax on fuel or a tax on

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So now

5

what you're claiming is that -- and this is

6

what's bothering me and I'm trying to get to

7

it -- you're saying that the tribe, unlike

8

anyone else in the state, can refuse to pay

9

taxes that really have nothing to do with

10

transportation but have to do with drug

11

regulation, which have to do with keeping

12

certain bad things out, which have to do with

13

raising money for other reasons.

14

Now that -- you see what I'm saying?

15

I'm saying the common sense of it is why would

16

this treaty give a tribe the right not to pay

17

taxes that have really nothing to do with

18

transportation, that's just the way, et cetera.

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

20

answer that in two ways.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

All right.

Let me

Yes.
The first answer is,

23

if it's truly a regulatory fine, if it's like

24

you can't possess marijuana and we are

25

punishing you, then we don't view that as a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

tax.

We view that as a regulation.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

All right.
I think that, you

4

know, the distinction between taxes and fines

5

might in some cases be difficult to identify.

6

Not in this case.

7

tax.

8
9
10
11

This is definitely a -- a

JUSTICE ALITO:

So where do you get

the difference between a regulation and a -­
and -- and a tax under the words of the treaty?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I -- so we're

12

following this Court's decision in Tulee and

13

Yakama Indian Nation.

14

your question.

15

I'm not trying to evade

The words of the treaty, I think it's

16

the "in common with" language that opens the

17

door to certain types of regulatory rules.

18

think that, by implication, the fact that the

19

Yakama ceded rights in all of this land

20

probably opens the door to the state to protect

21

public safety in that land.

22

I

Right?

So, if a person's carrying a firearm

23

or diseased apples, which is going to cause

24

other people to die, then there's a similar

25

justification for permitting those laws as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

permitting speed limits.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

from?

4

certain things.

5

does that come from?

6

Where does that come

There's -- you -- you -- you prohibit
You tax certain things.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Where

Well, so this is the

7

line the Court drew in the Tulee case with

8

respect to the fishing clause and in the

9

Puyallup case.

10

There's like explicit language

saying we distinguish between the two.

11

So we're following the Court's lead on

12

this issue.

13

that a tax isn't necessary in the relevant

14

sense.

15

that non-Indians can use the resource in common

16

with Indians.

17

And the Court has essentially said

And so you don't need the tax to ensure

And, similarly, I don't think you -­

18

you need a tax to ensure, you know, public

19

safety in the relevant sense, whereas I think

20

that you really need to prevent, you know,

21

diseased apples or firearms in order to protect

22

public safety.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

If an

24

off-reservation sales tax is okay, as you say

25

it is, why is an off-reservation possession tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

not okay?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I don't think

3

this is a possession tax, Your Honor.

4

it's a -- it's a transportation tax.

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

6

possession tax.

7
8

Suppose it is a

Is that then okay?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So we -- we have a

broader argument -­

9
10

I think

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

An off-reservation

possession tax?

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So we have a broader

12

argument in our brief and a narrower one.

13

the broader one it's not, and the narrower one

14

it is.

15

you've got to look at what the tribal member is

16

doing.

17

on breathing, right?

18

something without possessing it, just like you

19

can't transport it without breathing it.

20

So

So the broader argument in our brief is

And because he can't -- it's like a tax
You can't transport

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That seems to be

21

an argument that it's a sham, that it's really

22

getting to transportation.

23

strong a word, but it's not -- it's really

24

about transportation, not possession.

25

it's really about possession?

"Sham" might be too

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What if

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I think, under the

2

broadest possible version of our argument, we

3

probably -- but I'm not going to push this very

4

hard -- I think it would be preempted, but I'm

5

not going to push it very hard because I think

6

that this really is a transportation tax.

7

I think it's actually quite helpful to

8

look at why the statute is written the way it

9

is, to understand why we really think this is a

10

transportation tax.

So I get that the overall

11

goal of the state is to ensure that all fuel

12

sold at retail is subject to a tax.

13

But the natural way to do that is just

14

to tax the retail sale, but this Court has held

15

in the Chickasaw Nation case that those types

16

of taxes are preempted.

17

Washington taxes were preempted.

18

And, in fact, some

And so what the state decided to do

19

is, as my colleague states, move the incidence

20

outside the reservation.

21

tax -- for fuel like this, when you have an

22

Indian distributor hauling it from out of state

23

to the Indian reservation, to sale to an Indian

24

retailer, the only connection between this fuel

25

and off-reservation activity is that you're

But the thing is, for

it.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's

Well, what if

4

you have the -- the tank where the fuel is

5

going to go in is -- is right by the border and

6

it's a tax on fuel that goes into the tank?

7

They don't care what you do with it; you can

8

transport it, you can -- whatever you want to

9

do with it.

And it's owned by Cougar Den, the

10

-- the -- the tank, and they then use it,

11

transport it in their trucks.

12

In other words, the state doesn't care

13

about transportation.

14

as it comes into the border, with no

15

involvement by Cougar Den, it comes into -­

16

it's taxed in their tank, and then that's it.

17

End of story as far as the state's concerned.

18

It just wants -- as soon

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I understand that

19

overall the state just wants the money in some

20

sense.

21

this way is because it knows -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

talking about my hypothetical tax, okay?

24

as soon as it goes into a tank, not one of the

25

tanker trucks, then it's taxed on that.

But the reason it's structured this tax

No, I'm

It -­

As

to do about transportation at all.

4

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Nothing

5

referring to like taking the -- the fuel from

6

the truck and putting it into a big tank off

7

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A non- -­

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

that's the hypothetical, then that wouldn't be

transportation.

that.

look at the taxable event.

transportation, there's one result.

It says bulk entry or

something like that, non-bulk entry.

And what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

I'm actually bothered about is people are going

to buy millions of things online.

3

state says the following:

4

sales tax.

5

looks like this.

6

online enters into the state, a tax is due.

7

You know, that's pretty close to this statute.

8

And what I'm having trouble is seeing

9

And so a

We just want our

And so they pass a statute that
When something you've bought

how your argument -- that's why I have this

10

other argument, where it's just fuel.

11

don't accept that.

12

But you

Okay.

How your argument would permit the

13

state to -- it would deny the state the right

14

to tax the Indian tribe when they've done what

15

everybody else has done, just bought things

16

online, and they haven't yet paid the use tax

17

or haven't yet paid the comparable sales tax.

18

Now that's what's really bothering me.

And -- and if you can give me a minute or so on

20

that, I would be helped.

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, I'm happy to.

22

So on -- on the hypothetical of buying things

23

online, I think it would depend on how the

24

statute defined the taxable event.

25

course, there's -- there's some recent

So, of

developments in the law in the Wayfair case

2

involving out-of-state taxation.

3

So, if the state is capable of taxing

4

the sale -- in other words, the taxable event

5

is the transaction itself -- that wouldn't be a

6

treaty issue.

7

dormant Commerce Clause, whatever.

8

wouldn't be a treaty issue.

is the incidence, in some sense, of the tax,

There might be other issues,

that's the thing that's being taxed, then that

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think that, again,

at what precisely is being taxed.

taxed.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- it seems to me you

19

can look at this in one of two ways, and which

20

way you look at it, in part, you know, suggests

21

who should win.

22

The first is you -- you could say:

23

What is the taxpayer here doing?

Is what the

24

taxpayer here doing within the terms of the

25

treaty?

And there, it just seems to me that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

you win because what the taxpayer is doing is

2

transporting goods to and from market.

3

say he's possessing the goods.

4

he's breathing while he's transporting the

5

goods.

6

goods to and from market.

7

suggests that you should win, where the focus

8

is on the activity taxed.

You can

You can say

But what he's doing is transporting
So -- so that

9

But what I hear the state and the SG

10

in its brief saying is you shouldn't focus on

11

the thing that the taxpayer is doing, you

12

should instead sort of look to the purpose of

13

the state.

14

scope of activities that the state is trying to

15

tax and why they have this tax.

16

to them, they have this tax because they want

17

to get to every single taxpayer who possesses

18

fuel in the state.

19

necessary to get to Yakama taxpayers.

20

You should look to what is the full

And according

And this is what's

So what should we focus on:

the

21

activity that the taxpayer is doing or the

22

purpose of the state legislation?

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, of course, I think

24

it's the activity.

And I think that your

25

question is really what this case boils down

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63

to.

2

And I think there's a lot of reasons

3

why the former answer is correct and the latter

4

is not.

5

treaty right focuses on the Indian's right.

6

says the Indian has the right to trade and -­

7

to travel, excuse me.

8

sort of the holistic intent of the state and

9

why it's enacting a particular tax.

First of all, I just think that the

10

It

I don't see a focus on

Also, I think, in the Wagnon case, the

11

whole argument by the tribe in that case is

12

that what the state was really trying to do was

13

burden things on the reservation.

14

said we don't look at these broad assessments

15

of purpose.

16

analysis of the thing that's being taxed.

17

that's really just the analysis that we're

18

asking the Court to do here.

19

The Court

We -- we look at this formal
And

And, actually, in the right to fish

20

cases, the Court has done the same thing.

21

Court has understood the right to fish as

22

essentially providing an easement on private

23

property to fish that preempts any state laws

24

that would prevent you to going on the

25

property.

Those laws were the ultimate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

generally applicable laws.

They applied to

2

Indians and non-Indians.

3

regardless of whether you're going on the

4

property to fish or to do something else.

They applied

5

They had absolutely nothing whatsoever

6

to do with fishing, but they were still held to

7

be preempted because you looked at what the

8

Indian was trying to do, which is fish, and the

9

Court held that the treaty gave the Indian the

10
11

right to do that.
I think that's also true, by the way,

12

with like the on-reservation tax versus

13

off-reservation tax distinction.

14

Chickasaw Nation, this Court held that a tax on

The tax at issue had -- was not targeting

as applied to protected activity, in that case

on-reservation activity, the tax was preempted.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

The retailers are

it seems there are four relevant words.

The

tax on fuel applies when the fuel "enters into

for the word "fuel" things bought online, which

could be anything at all, and then we can have

diseased things or I don't know what,

8

marijuana, and you are saying -- and I think

you are saying this -- that this statute, which

had to do with travel on the roads, applies to

all those things as long as they use the words

that have to be true.

It can't just go by an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I've got

Official - Subject to Final Review
67

that.

Now what else?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, again, we have a

3

broader argument and a narrower argument.

4

do have one specific argument in our brief

5

which focuses on the fact that this -- this

6

traveled through the ceded area.

7

We

Now I think that it would still be

8

preempted even if it was outside the ceded

9

area, but sort of the narrowest argument in our

10

brief goes like this, right?

11

the Indians secured, you have to look at what

12

they had.

13

this particular stretch of land, which is a tax

14

immunity, and, therefore, if you want to look

15

at what they kept, it's an immunity that

16

applies specifically when the truck is going

17

across that land.

18

To look at what

And they had something special on

Now I will say that for off -- for -­

19

for travel off the ceded area, I probably still

20

would be arguing preemption given that the

21

treaty by its terms applies to all public

22

highways.

23

But the narrowest version of our

24

argument in our brief really only applies to

25

this particular travel because of the special

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68

rights that the tribe enjoyed on that stretch

2

of land at the time of the treaty.

-- between the

ceded area and the other areas.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So the textual hook

for that would be the word "secured," which

this Court has construed as requiring looking

at what they already possessed when -­

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

question, which is your -- your position

depends on disaggregating possession and

transportation, but you could possess something

without transporting.

17

transport without possessing fuel.

18
19
20

You can obviously

So the tax -- why -- why can't we
disaggregate possession and transportation?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, first of all, I

21

think that in many ways these are state law

22

questions.

23

dispute in this case about whether this is just

24

like one statute on first possession or a whole

25

bunch of different subsections that are taxing

Like, there's this fundamental

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

different types of things, one of which is

2

transportation.

3

And it's kind of like a philosophical

4

question.

5

state law question, not a federal question.

6

seems to me if the state court is construing

7

authority to -­

11

But I think that ultimately that's a

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It

So, if a state

court construed it differently from this state
court, you would have a different position?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I mean, I think I'd

12

probably still try to argue preemption, but I

13

think it would be much harder than the argument

14

I'm currently making to you today, because the

15

Court has held that the incidence of the tax is

16

a question of state law.

17

It just seems to me that if -- if the

18

state court is saying that this is a

19

transportation tax, and transportation is

20

treaty-protected activity, it just kind of

21

follows like almost, like, inevitably that

22

there's -- there's preemption because, you

23

know, you're taxing treaty-protected activity

24

based on the statute as it's authoritatively

25

construed by the state court.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

I just would like to say one thing

2

about why I think that, you know, this -- what

3

the state is doing here is quite inconsistent

4

with what I think the expectation of the tribe

5

would have been in 1855, because the tribe was

6

actually specifically concerned about

7

transporting fuel along this route, right?

8

so Governor Stephens promised in the treaty

9

minutes, you can take your goods to market to

And

10

the river, which is a reference to the Columbia

11

River.

12

land.

13

And this actually used to be their

So sort of as consideration for giving

14

up this stretch of land, which at the time was

15

their land, that they agreed that they would

16

continue to -- to travel across it.

17

have the right to travel.

18

They'd

And so I think it is a little bit of a

19

bait and switch to the Yakamas to say, well,

20

now we're going to basically exploit the fact

21

that you have to travel across this stretch of

22

land to impose this tax that we wouldn't

23

otherwise be able to impose, and, by the way,

24

the effect of the tax is to mimic in a tax on

25

the reservation -- on on-reservation retailers.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
71
1

And I think that, you know, I haven't

2

talked about the treaty canon so far because I

3

think neutral principles are more than

4

sufficient to resolve this case for Respondent,

5

but at least under the -- the generous

6

interpretation principles for Indians, I don't

7

think that's what the Indians thought they were

8

getting, that this exploitation of the travel

9

on the very land they gave up, securing for

10
11

themselves the right to travel across it.
I think that it's very natural and

12

consistent with what I think the expectation of

13

the Yakamas would have been, that they could

14

continue traveling across that land with their

15

goods as they were already doing it at the

16

time, and -- and that means -- that means

17

transporting without paying a fee or owing an

18

obligation to the states.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does it mean

20

anything that this tax is literally on

21

traveling the route, importing by a highway?

22

There is no similar tax on importation by

23

licensed people.

24

the user who buys it pays the tax, correct?

25

They don't pay the tax.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes.

Only

I think that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
72
1

actually a very important point in this case,

2

because the state cast this as a first

3

possession tax, but, honestly, that's just the

4

state's gloss on it.

5

And, in fact, that's not even how it operates,

6

because, if you're the first possessor via

7

highway, you pay the tax.

8

licensed importer and you're a first possessor

9

via a boat, you don't.

10

That's not what it says.

But, if you're a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you want

11

to characterize it as a transport tax, and the

12

statute doesn't say that either.

13

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that the

14

state court is responsible for construing state

15

law.

16

pays the tax.

17

Appendix, the taxpayer is defined as the

18

importer.

19

think is intuitive, that importation is a

20

species of transportation.

21

It says import, which is the importer
On page 121 of the Joint

And the state court said, which I

And so there is an authoritative

22

decision that this statute taxes

23

transportation.

24
25

So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
it's not consistent.

The problem is

You're right, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
73
1

wholesalers, licensed wholesalers are the

2

importers, but they don't pay the tax.

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah.

So this is not

4

a tax on first possession.

It just doesn't

5

work that way.

6

adding this gloss that this is just one big tax

7

on first possession, even though, obviously,

8

when you just look at the words of the statute,

9

it isn't one.

And -- and the state is just

And that's why I think the Court

10

should just use the words of the statute which

11

talk about importation and entry and the

12

construction of that by the state court, rather

13

than determining preemption, essentially by the

14

gloss placed on the state's attorneys based on

15

words that are not in the statute, nor did the

16

state court think those things to be true.

The second crucial point -­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But on -- on that one,

8

didn't Mr. Unikowsky say, consistent with our

9

case law, that there's a difference between

10
11

taxation and regulation?
MR. PURCELL:

And -- and that's just a

12

misrepresentation of the case law.

13

cases have said the state can regulate fishing

14

to conserve the fish, the very thing that's the

15

subject of the treaty.

16

there's no similar rationale here.

17

The fishing

There's no similar -­

The Court has never said that we can

18

regulate fishing more generally than that.

19

There's no distinction in this Court's cases in

20

treaty cases between taxing and regulation.

21

More broadly, Mescalero actually rejected

22

exactly that argument.

23

The second point is that, under their

24

theory, we could completely ban the

25

transportation of fuel by highway if we did it

It is not a tax on

It is not a tax on transportation.

is a tax on the fuel itself.
So -- so even if you accept much of

a ruling in their favor.

So, for all those reasons

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Has Washington

considered taxing non-tribal members for their

purchases on tribal lands?

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, that is the

7

system that we had before we adopted this

8

system, and it was struck down by a federal

9

court in Washington.

And then we adopted this

10

tax, modeled on what this Court said was okay

11

in Wagnon.

12

I'd also like to address Wagnon just

does not address the issue in this case.

14

Wagnon was about who the tax applies to and

15

where the incidence of the tax is.

16

In this case, those things are

17

undisputed.

Wagnon described a tax that the State
