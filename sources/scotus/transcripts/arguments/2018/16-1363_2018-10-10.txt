CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, versus

6

Preap.

Mr. Tripp.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. TRIPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

A criminal alien does not become

13

exempt from mandatory detention by the

14

happenstance that DHS did not arrest them

15

immediately or promptly after they got out of

16

jail or prison.

17

this point is just to look at the statutory

18

text.

19

And the best way to illustrate

And -- and the -- the key provision

20

we're talking about here is 1226(c)(2).

This

21

is the prohibition against releasing a detained

22

criminal alien.

23

merits brief.

24

Secretary may release an alien described in

25

paragraph (1) only if it is for witness

And this is on page 4 of our
And what it says is that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

protection.

2

And it's undisputed here that the

3

witness protection exception does not apply and

4

that this categorically prohibits the release

5

on bond of anybody who is an alien described in

6

paragraph (1).

7

So then the question is, who are those

8

aliens?

And on -- and in paragraph (1) -- it's

9

on the prior page, and it just answers that in

10

no uncertain terms.

11

shall take into custody "any alien who is

12

inadmissible" or "is deportable" under these

13

different provisions that relate to their

14

criminal history or terrorist activities.

15

It says, the Secretary

And so an alien described in -- in

16

paragraph (1) is any alien who is inadmissible

17

or is deportable under one of these provisions.

18

In -- in the next part of the

19
20

statute -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what meaning do

21

you give to when the alien is released?

22

it command you to do anything?

23

MR. TRIPP:

Does

Yeah, the -- the key

24

function of that, so -- is to tell the

25

Secretary when to act, right?

So it's aligned

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

flush left, along with the command that the

2

Secretary shall -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you don't see

4

any sense of urgency in your acting, no sense

5

of encouraging you -­

6

MR. TRIPP:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

actually do what the statute says -­

9
10
11
12

MR. TRIPP:

Oh, no, we -­
-- in some way to

We -- we -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which is to

take custody of somebody?
MR. TRIPP:

-- we absolutely think

13

that this conveys a sense of urgency, and I

14

think we're in full agreement with Respondents

15

that this is directing -- that -- that this is

16

an urgent priority.

17

and -- and it -- and it kicks in, it is

18

triggered as soon as the alien is released.

19
20
21

It's a mandate, you know,

It is -- our -- our key point is that
the phrase "when the alien is released" -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So tell me why

22

would you have -- need transition rules under

23

your reading of this statute, which there were.

24

And the transition rules said you have two

25

years, essentially, to put in place enough

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

personnel and facilities to do what the statute

2

requires you to do.

3

Why did you need that two-year period

4

if, in your view, you have absolute

5

discretion -­

6

MR. TRIPP:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

It's -­
-- to pick an

alien up whenever you want to any way?

9

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think that's really

10

not a fair characterization of our position.

11

Our understanding is that this is a mandate.

12

It -- it is triggered immediately.

13

large number of cases, the arrest is going to

14

occur immediately.

15

this statute was going to direct that many more

16

aliens be arrested.

17

In a very

This is a mandate.

And

And so under our standard -- our, you

18

know -- and the real concern with the

19

transition period rules was a lack of bed

20

space.

21

And under both of our interpretations,

22

this is going to drive up the number of aliens

23

who are arrested.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

But

why did you need the transition rules at all?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

If you have discretion, as you claim to have,

2

to decide when you're going to pick up an

3

alien, either the day of release or, in one

4

case, before -- 11 years later, you didn't need

5

the transition rules.

6

what you needed to do to create the bed space

7

or get the personnel and start arresting people

8

when you thought you could.

9

MR. TRIPP:

You could have just done

But, again, I want to be

10

clear, we don't interpret this to say that we

11

can arrest the person whenever we want.

12

we understand this to be a continuing urgent

13

obligation to arrest them right now.

14

We -­

We need to arrest them when they get

15

out.

We need to arrest them the next day, the

16

next month, whenever it happens.

17

know, sometimes it may not occur for years -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MR. TRIPP:

20
21
22

So let's go to -­

-- because DHS doesn't

know where the person is.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- let's go to the

release provision.

23

MR. TRIPP:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

But, you

an entire paragraph.

Right.
Paragraph (1) is

It describes a type of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

alien and an alien who's picked up at a

2

particular time.

3

So, if the statute intended this lack

4

of authority to kick in if the alien only met

5

(A) through (D), why doesn't the statute say

6

that?

7

MR. TRIPP:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

Well, I guess -­
Why doesn't it say

paragraph (1), (A) through (D)?
MR. TRIPP:

A -- a couple responses.

11

I think those are the only portions of the

12

statute that describe -- that actually describe

13

the alien.

14

released" doesn't describe him.

15

given that he's already been fully described.

16
17

The phrase "when the alien is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. TRIPP:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

It -- it describes

the type of alien we're talking about.

18

20

It takes as a

I -- I don't think -­
It describes the

person who's subject to this provision.
MR. TRIPP:

I -- I don't think that's

22

right because it says when -- that might be

23

right if it said something like the Secretary

24

shall take into custody any alien who is

25

inadmissible and deportable, you know, and who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

has not been released for more than such and

2

such amount of time.

3

But that's not what it says.

4

when the alien is released, which I think takes

5

as a given that he's already been fully

6

described.

7

It says

But another, I think, important answer

8

to this is the text of 1226(a), which I'd also

9

like to -- to walk through.

Their basic theory

10

is that these arrests are happening under (a).

11

I don't think they're right about that, but

12

even if they were, they would still lose.

13

So under -- this is in the Pet. App.,

14

actually, at 141a.

15

background rule, and it has -- like (C), it has

16

these two sentences.

17

arrest, and the second is about custody.

18

And 1226(a), this is the

The first is about

And the first sentence says, "on a

19

warrant issued by the Attorney General, an

20

alien may be arrested and detained, pending a

21

decision on whether he is to be removed."

22

And so what (c)(1) does is it takes

23

that discretionary authority and it turns it

24

into a mandate to the Secretary that she shall

25

arrest these certain criminal aliens.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But what

-JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Tripp, is your

3

-- your position then it is totally irrelevant

4

whether the -- the change in custody is

5

immediate or it's seven years down the road?

6

Whenever it occurs, the Attorney General has no

7

discretion to have a bond hearing?

8

occurs, seven years, eight years, 10 years, the

9

person is detained without bond, right?

10
11
12

MR. TRIPP:

Whenever it

Yes, that's absolutely our

-- our understanding of (c)(2), yeah.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -­

Along those lines,

13

Mr. Tripp, does the government have any view

14

about if ever the obligation under (c) lapses?

15

Could it be 30 years?

Could it be -­

16

MR. TRIPP:

Under (c)(1)?

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yeah.

The

18

obligation to take into custody under (c)(1).

Thirty years, and the government was aware of

20

him the entire time and chose not to act.

21

22

the government's power?

23

MR. TRIPP:

Kind

Is there any limit on

So we understand that -­

24

that -- (c)(1) to be a continuing obligation,

25

it does not lapse, but can I -- if I could just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

follow through with (a) -- with the text of (a)

2

and just how this supports us on the custody

3

determination, I think it would be helpful.

4

So as I -- there's this first

5

discretionary authority to arrest the alien and

6

then the next sentence talks about what do you

7

do after he's been arrested, and what it says

8

is, except as provided in subsection (c) of

9

this section and pending such decision, the

10

Secretary either may continue to detain him or

11

may release him on bond.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. TRIPP:

14

So, Mr. Tripp -­

But, of course, what (c)

says is you can't release him at all.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- just to think about

16

how these two provisions interact with each

17

other, I'm wondering if you can tell me with

18

respect to a group of people who are not

19

involved here.

20

MR. TRIPP:

Okay.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

As I understand it,

22

these (A) through (D) categories include some

23

people who have never been in criminal custody

24

at all.

25

terrorists.

So let's take spouses or children of
But there are a number of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

categories of people who have never been in

2

custody at all.

3

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So they fit within

5

this (A) through (D) category.

6

where you think the authority to detain them

7

comes from.

8

come from (c) or does it come from (a)?

9

I'm wondering

Does the authority to detain them

MR. TRIPP:

The authority to -- so I

10

think, actually, for all of them, the authority

11

to do the arrest comes from (a).

12

and -- but what happens with (c) is (c)(1)

13

makes the arrest mandatory, and we do think it

14

makes it mandatory including for those people

15

who have never been in custody at all, that the

16

"when the alien is released" describes when the

17

duty is triggered, but there are some aliens,

18

in particular with the (c)(1)(D) category that

19

you're talking about, the national security

20

terrorist ones where the person has never been

21

in any prior custody.

22
23
24
25

And -- and -­

But, again, it -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm not -- I'm

not -­
MR. TRIPP:

-- it really ultimately

doesn't matter.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

matters to me, I think.

3

saying, if I -- if I understand your -- your

4

view of described in paragraph (1), these

5

aliens are described in paragraph (1) even

6

though they've never been in criminal custody.

7

MR. TRIPP:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

Well, it sort of
You know, you could be

That's right.
So that would suggest

that (c)(1) is authorizing their detention, and
that's what you're saying?

11

MR. TRIPP:

No.

Sorry, (c) -- well,

12

(c) -- (c)(1) is about arrest, just like the

13

first sentence of (a) is about arrest.

14

a -­

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

arresting these people?

17

under (c)(1)?

18

MR. TRIPP:

Yes.

This is

How are you

Are you arresting them

I think actually, frankly,

19

the answer is that we're arresting them under

20

both (a) and (c)(1).

21

they have to be upon a warrant.

22

requirement comes from (a).

23

You know, the arrests,
That

The -- the -- this -- all of this is

24

pending a determination of whether the alien is

25

to be removed.

That comes from (a).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, when you say

2

you're arresting them under both, are you

3

saying that with respect to everybody under

4

(c)(1), you're also arresting -­

5

MR. TRIPP:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

Okay.

Yes.
-- them under (a)?

So that I'm not interested in.

8

MR. TRIPP:

Okay.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, that kind of

10

-- you're saying that those people are under

11

(c)(1) to the same extent as people who have

12

been in criminal custody?

13

MR. TRIPP:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that seems odd to

15

me because (c)(1) seems to me all about people

16

who have been in criminal custody.

17

MR. TRIPP:

Well -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now you have this

19

question about how about if there's a gap

20

between the criminal custody, but -- but -- but

21

your interpretation necessitates that you

22

understand even people who have never been in

23

criminal custody as part of the (c)(1) group.

24
25

MR. TRIPP:

That's right.

I think

just the one thing I would point out is in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

overwhelming majority of applications of this

2

statute, this is, I think, still totally

3

sensible because, in the overwhelming majority

4

of applications, the person is about criminal,

5

and in all of the criminal ones, there's going

6

to have been some prior criminal custody.

7

so that's -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. TRIPP:

10
11

And

You know -­

-- I think, really the

paradigm of the statute.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- yes, this is -­

12

this is a small group relatively, but it's

13

definitely a group.

14

of subcategories that have never been in

15

criminal custody here, and we could go over

16

what they are if anybody's interested, but

17

there are a number.

18

There are quite a number

And -- and -- and your statutory

19

interpretation, particularly your narrow view

20

of the term described in paragraph (1),

21

requires that those people be understood as

22

within the (c)(1) custody authority, and, I

23

don't know, I look at the (c)(1) custody

24

authority and it's all about criminal custody

25

and what happens when you're released from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

criminal custody, and that makes me think that

2

your interpretation of the words described in

3

paragraph (1) is wrong.

4

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I -- I -- I think

5

it's more that you may disagree about whether

6

the duty to arrest -- the mandate to arrest

7

them in (c)(1) kicks in when an alien has -­

8

has not been in prior criminal custody, in some

9

prior state or federal criminal custody, but

10

even -- even if you disagree with us on that,

11

so, first of all, all of the Respondents here

12

have been in some prior custody.

13

And, of -- of -- of course, what -­

14

what we're really saying is that, you know, the

15

-- the timing of their arrest, the timing of

16

their release is just -- is -- is totally

17

irrelevant when it comes to (c)(2).

So assume, as I am assuming, that this

19

paragraph is ambiguous at most in your favor.

20

And if it's ambiguous, and if there is a huge,

21

as I think, a huge constitutional question,

22

then don't we read it not to apply or to apply

quibble over what's a crime involving moral

I'm saying that there's a -- a

paragraph, which says shall be arrested upon

position?

6

I was.

7

Is the government's position that this

What is your

I'm not even criticizing you, though

MR. TRIPP:

Our position is absolutely

8

that this -- that this applies regardless of

9

the time in.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not retroactive.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. TRIPP:

looking at that yet.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So your position is

yes, he's 50.
MR. TRIPP:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. TRIPP:

22

Okay.

So -- so we're not -- not

18

21

Okay.

This statute went into

13

15

Okay.

And then -­
Okay.

Now -­

-- to get into the

constitutional question -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But wait.

Let me ask

23

another question, please, because I have the

24

answer now what your position is.

25

Okay.

Now my second question is this:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

There is support for your position in the

2

cases, and the cases that support it, I

3

thought, were the cases that says when the

4

government misses a bail deadline, then you can

5

go ahead and have the bail hearing anyway, see,

6

when there's a bail deadline missed, because

7

that's not really said about what happens when

8

you miss the bail deadline.

9

MR. TRIPP:

10
11

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the same is true

here.

12

MR. TRIPP:

That's right.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that I thought

14

was your strong -- to me the strongest

15

argument.

16

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that -­

So I thought then -­

18

and this is my question -- I thought then, is

19

this like those cases?

20

thought was:

21

there is A, no statement of what happens when

22

you miss the deadline, right there, and, B, the

23

government, well, says -- all right.

24

enough.

25

And the answer I

Well, yes, in the sense that

A is good

But there is a big difference.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In the

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

bail cases, the result of missing the deadline,

2

the result of reading in no deadline is you're

3

going to have a bail hearing.

4

will be protected, right?

5

be protected with a bail hearing.

6

individual will not be hurt much because all

7

he'd be missing is a hearing that he should

8

have had anyway.

9

The community

The community will
And the

But, in this case, if you read the

10

statute the same way, what you're doing to the

11

individual is many who are no danger to the

12

community, no danger to the community, you're

13

depriving them of a hearing that could mean

14

their release and you're keeping them instead

15

for 11, 12, 13, 14 years.

16

And what you're doing to the

17

community, reading it your way, if we read it

18

the opposite way, nothing.

You'll have the

The dangerous people won't get

21

MR. TRIPP:

So I -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I thought in terms

23

of the purposes -- are you following what I'm

24

saying?

25

MR. TRIPP:

Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

You see, in terms of

2

the purposes of the bail statute or this

3

statute or any other statute, we read it

4

technically your way, and we hurt everybody in

5

terms of the purposes.

6

way and we hurt virtually nobody.

We read it the opposite

7

MR. TRIPP:

So this is the piece I -­

8

I want to push back on hard.

9

is -- the Montalvo-Murillo, these better late

I think this

10

than never cases, I think, are squarely on

11

point for our understanding of (c)(1).

12

and the key point, as you said, is that, you

13

know -- well, a couple things.

14

And -­

One is, you know, what is the

15

authority that you would lose?

16

we would lose is (c)(2), the authority to hold

17

them without a bail hearing.

18

point of this statute is to stop doing bail

19

hearings on the ground -- on the traditional

20

bail factors of flight risk and recidivism.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. TRIPP:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MR. TRIPP:

25

issue.

The authority

And the whole

Mr. Tripp?

That's the entire point.
Mr. Tripp?

Congress looked at this

They -- they -- they worked with it for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

years and years and years.

And I think,

2

basically, at the end of the day, Congress's

3

answer was enough is enough, that if you're an

4

alien, you come here, you commit one of these

5

crimes, you've effectively forfeited whatever

6

right you have to remain at large in the

7

community.

8

And so to be looking back at the bail

9

factors is to defeat the -- the purpose of the

10

statute.

11

powerful examples here, just among the named

12

plaintiffs.

13

And we have two, I think, very

Right?

We have Mr. -- so Mr. Mony Preap, he

14

was out for seven years and then he was

15

rearrested for a domestic abuse charge which he

16

pleaded down to battery.

17

Moya -­

18
19

We have Mr. Rodriguez

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And yet he -- yet

he got cancellation of removal, didn't he?

20

MR. TRIPP:

He did get cancellation of

21

removal.

But then we have Mr. Rodriguez Moya,

22

who was out for three years, he got a bond

23

hearing, he was released, and he attempted to

24

murder his ex-girlfriend and succeeded in

25

murdering her new boyfriend.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, Mr. Tripp, what

2

is the definition of the class that was

3

certified by the district court?

4

consist of -- solely of people who have been -­

5

who were released from criminal custody many

6

years ago?

7

MR. TRIPP:

Does it

No, not even close.

It's

8

-- it's any -- any criminal alien who is not

9

arrested immediately.

So there's an

10

extraordinary mismatch between the kinds of

11

claims that were -- that -- that I think

12

Respondents are getting at, these sort of

13

long-, long-term ones, and what we're talking

14

about here.

15

And I think really what those -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have any sense,

17

understanding, even estimate of the -- in the

18

whole class, how many people are people who

19

were detained a day later?

20

were -- you know, were detained a year plus

21

later?

22

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah.

How many people

So I -- I think the

23

short answer is we really don't know.

24

-- there's nothing in the record on that.

25

there aren't any published statistics on this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There's
And

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1
2

either.
I think one thing that might help is

3

if I could just take a step back and explain

4

the many reasons why gaps in custody can occur

5

and why they're often fairly long.

6

So -- so, first, in order to arrest an

7

alien under one of these provisions, DHS, of

8

course, first needs to know that the person is

9

actually an alien and that they've actually

10
11

committed one of these crimes.
And in many cases, that's going to

12

take like real leg work by DHS officers on -­

13

on the ground, pulling the records of

14

conviction, looking to see the statute,

15

comparing the elements of the statute to the

16

elements of the generic offense.

17

And I think, as the Court is painfully

18

aware, that can -- that can be difficult and

19

time-consuming.

20

And then even when -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about saying a

21

reasonable time, the word -- the words that we

22

know are there, "upon his release," means a

23

reasonable time within his release, you know, a

24

reasonable time.

25

have been hiding in the mountains for 10 years,

Therefore, the people who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

we say, well, yeah, that's a reasonable time.

2

But the people who have families and have jobs

3

and have lived as citizens of the community for

4

14 years, that was not a reasonable time when

5

you went 14 years later.

6

What about that typical legal term in

7

order to satisfy what the government says, as

8

you say, is its major interest?

9

MR. TRIPP:

So I think a couple of

10

responses.

11

timing requirement at all, and that's the

12

statute that we are relying on.

13

second, what you're really getting at and I

14

think the force of what you're saying is that

15

it feels different when the alien's been out

16

for a really, really long period of time.

17

So, first, (c)(2) doesn't have a

And I think,

And I think what -- what that's

18

getting at is -- I -- I think that -- that it

19

would have been perfectly rational for Congress

20

to add a statute of limitations here, to say

21

something in (c)(2) like an alien may be

22

released only if it's for witness protection or

23

if -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

constitutional problem with that?

12

Are you saying that there's no

18

that it's wrongly decided.

is that Demore only applies if the person was

22
23

They are not asking the

what I'm saying.

made up of people who hadn't -- who had lived

6

five years, 10 years, 15 years.

7

9

I mean, assume that this class were

serious constitutional claims in your view?
MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think the answer is

10

no under the analysis in Demore.

11

all, when a -- when a criminal alien is finally

12

put into removal proceedings, they know this is

13

happening, they've been arrested, all of that.

14

So, first of

The -- the incentive to flee is not

15

insubstantial.

16

conviction is almost always going to establish

17

that they are removable, and they're often

18

going to be ineligible for any kind of relief.

19

So this -- the -- it's not going to look -­

20

Their -- their criminal

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- could

21

you explain then why Preap himself was eligible

22

for relief?

23

MR. TRIPP:

Because not -- only some

24

criminal aliens and -- and more -- more LPRs

25

have eligibility for relief.

If you're not an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

LPR, the -- the barrier is -- is -- is much

2

broader.

3

But -- but also I think -- again, I

4

think even just the facts of this case show

5

that the danger of recidivism does not

6

disappear after you pass some number of years.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, would you do me

8

one favor?

First, assume I'm right, which I

9

know is a heroic assumption.

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- but -- but

12

assume that there's a constitutional problem in

13

a country which gives every triple ax murderer

14

a bail hearing, but these people don't, okay?

15

All you're involved is a bail hearing.

16

assume another thing with me, which you don't

17

want to, that the statute is ambiguous.

18

Now

Now, if I'm right on those two things,

19

why would the government really care?

20

the government care?

21

say, okay, we'll give him a bail hearing?

22

-- the baddies will be in jail, and the ones

23

who are no risk won't be.

24
25

MR. TRIPP:

Why does

Why wouldn't it want to
The

I -- I think the real

concern is really what Congress was getting at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

here, is that making this prediction of which

2

criminal aliens are going to flee and which are

3

going to re-offend is actually really, really

4

hard, right?

5

example of Mr. Rodriguez Moya, I think, drives

6

that home, you know, that when IJs were doing

7

this with the criminal alien in front of them,

8

on the basis of the traditional bail factors,

9

Congress's basic judgment was that too many of

And I think, you know, the -- the

10

them were going to be released and that it

11

actually wasn't working.

12

And so Congress, you know, they

13

experimented with this.

14

many decades, until Congress started narrowing

15

down and -- and building out these statutes -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. TRIPP:

18
19

That was the rule for

Well, Mr. Tripp -­

-- for mandatory

detention.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- you've been -­

20

you've been pushed on the question whether

21

there might be some circumstances in which an

22

alien who would otherwise fall within the

23

statute would have a constitutional right to a

24

bail hearing, but I thought the question that

25

we agreed to decide related to the -- what the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

Ninth Circuit saw as a requirement that the

2

alien that -- that Homeland Security take the

3

alien into custody immediately, and that was

4

the class of aliens that was certified by the

5

district court.

6

So, if we were to reverse that

7

determination, would that preclude a challenge

8

by -- an individual challenge, an as-applied

9

challenge by an alien who fell within the -­

10
11

the circumstances that have been described?
MR. TRIPP:

No, of course not.

That

12

safety valve is always available, and I think

13

it's frankly much -- much more faithful to what

14

Congress was trying to -- to accomplish here.

15

And if I -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and do you

17

agree that an alien could bring that challenge,

18

notwithstanding 1226(e)?

19

-- is -- is the jurisdictional provision.

20

MR. TRIPP:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So 1226(e), right, is

Yes.
Does that at all

22

prevent an alien from bringing the kind of

23

challenge that Justice Alito is talking about?

24
25

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think -- our

understanding is no, actually, aliens bring

these kinds of claims in the prolonged

detention context with some frequency.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

counsel.
Ms. Wang.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CECILLIA D. WANG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. WANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The government's reading is contrary

13

to the text, structure, and purpose of the

14

statute in at least three ways.

15

negates Congress's directive to use finite

16

mandatory detention resources on those who

17

would otherwise be released into the community

18

from criminal custody.

19

One, it

Second, it's not true that Congress

20

wanted to detain and deport all criminal

21

aliens, as the government claims in its reply

22

brief at page 12.

23

And, three, if Congress really wanted

24

what the executive branch claims here, it would

25

have simply written a statute that says people

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

in these four categories shall be detained

2

without a hearing until removed.

3

That is not what Congress did.

4

Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as

5

an exception to the general detention scheme in

6

1226(a) which applies except as provided in

7

subsection (c), not as except -- not except as

8

provided in section (c)(2), as the government

9

would have it.

10

Congress wrote section 1226(c) in two

11

paragraphs.

The first paragraph says who gets

12

taken into custody and when, and the second

13

paragraph says of those people in paragraph (1)

14

who can be released.

15

Now the government claims instead, in

16

a stretch of a reading, that you focus only on

17

paragraphs (A) through (D) in paragraph (1).

18

In other words, they say, section (c)(2) stands

19

alone as an authorization for mandatory

20

detention.

21

But that's not what Congress said.

22

said except -- as an alien described in

23

paragraph (1), not an alien described in

24

paragraph (1)(A) through (D).

25

And the government's reading, trying

It

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

to pull section (2), (c)(2), out as that

2

free-standing authorization, leads to three

3

serious anomalies that they struggle to

4

explain, as they did with you, Justice Kagan.

5

The first anomaly is, as you noted,

6

that the transition rules, which were meant to

7

be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are

8

completely superfluous.

9

really could delay, for whatever reason,

If the government

10

picking up people subject to mandatory

11

detention for as long as it needs or wants,

12

then Congress would not need to have that

13

intermediate step.

14

The second anomaly with the

15

government's reading is -- and the government

16

struggled with this in response, again, to your

17

questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only

18

qualification to be subject to mandatory

19

detention is that you fall into one of the four

20

categories in A through D, they necessarily

21

read out the prior criminal custody

22

requirement.

23

In -- in addition to the example you

24

gave, Justice Kagan, of a child or a spouse of

25

a terrorist, there's a very typical situation:

Official - Subject to Final Review

And I live in California or

I've never been

I've never been convicted of a
But based on my

office under the government's reading.

11

Now the government acknowledges that

12

eliminating a prior criminal custody

13

requirement would be anomalous, and they do

14

find, they do acknowledge there's a prior

15

criminal custody requirement.

16

finding that in the natural and obvious place

17

within the four corners of this statute, that

18

is, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the

19

phrase "when the alien is released," they go

20

hunting around back to the uncodified effective

21

date provision for Section 1226(c), which says

22

it applies to aliens released after October 8,

23

1998.

24
25

But instead of

That leads to a further anomaly, the
third anomaly, which, as Judge Baron explained

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

in his opinion in Castaneda, 810 F.3d at 29,

2

that the transition period rule, again, which

3

was meant to be an intermediate step up, is

4

less broad -- excuse me, is broader than the

5

permanent rule in Section 1226(c).

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Wang, there's

7

another anomaly.

Maybe you can explain it to

8

me.

9

one of the ones in A through D.

Let's take two people, identical crimes,
One of them

10

gets picked up immediately and no bail hearing.

11

The other doesn't get picked up until two years

12

later, bail hearing.

13

As far as the alien is concerned,

14

these two are identically situated, and yet one

15

gets the benefit of a bail hearing and the

16

other doesn't.

17

Why does that make sense?

18

MS. WANG:

Your Honor, well, the

19

person who is detained immediately falls under

20

Congress's scheme.

21

you're within categories A through D and you

22

are taken into custody, when you're released

23

from your criminal custody, and you aren't

24

needed for witness protection purposes,

25

mandatory detention -­

Congress provided that if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But suppose I'm the

2

-- I'm the alien in the category that's picked

3

up immediately, and I ask you, explain to me

4

why I don't get a hearing and yet someone who

5

had the benefit of being out for two years,

6

three years, does get a hearing.

7

MS. WANG:

My first response to you,

8

Justice Ginsburg, would be that's what the

9

statute provides.

10

And the second response is that the

11

Court decided in Demore in 2003 that applying

12

the mandatory detention rule, at least, not

13

considering the question before the Court now,

14

is constitutional.

15

And that brings me, I think, to the -­

16

to answer the question about constitutional

17

avoidance that you brought up, Justice Breyer,

18

that when Congress -- there are two reasons the

19

government says better late than never.

20

are lots of reasons why this Congress did not

21

want better late than never.

There

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Immediately?

So as

11

soon as the person is -- walks out of the door

12

of the prison or the jail, if -- if ICE doesn't

13

take the person into custody at that point,

14

that's the end of it?

15

MS. WANG:

No, Your Honor.

We would

16

ask the Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit,

17

which said that a reasonable degree of

18

immediacy is appropriate.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What -- what does -­
Is that different

from -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

What does "a

let's -- I don't know how many people will be

say, the State of California, but I'm sure

2

there are dozens, probably hundreds.

3

know.

4

I don't

A lot.
How is the federal government going to

5

be able to determine quickly, within 48 hours

6

or any short period of time, whether those

7

individuals would be subject to the mandatory

8

detention requirement of this statute?

9

California is not going to tell the

10

federal government, look, we're releasing this

11

person and this person is an alien, not a

12

citizen, and this is what the person was

13

convicted of.

14

that?

15

How are they supposed to do

MS. WANG:

Congress provided for how

16

they would do that, Justice Alito.

17

was thinking about state and local cooperation

18

at the same time they were enacting

19

Section 1226(c).

20

mechanisms for state and local cooperation with

21

federal authorities through statutes:

22

Section 1226(d), an adjacent provision; through

23

1257(g), also known colloquially as 287(g)

24

agreements; and through 1373, all in Title 8.

25

Congress

And what they did was set up

through

The major innovation that Congress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

wanted and got during that same time frame as

2

the '96 Act is described in the Senate report,

3

104.48, at pages 15 to 16, an automated

4

fingerprint system.

5

So Congress when it was writing

6

Section 1226(c) knew that they didn't have in

7

place all the pieces needed for this mechanism

8

to work, but they were putting other statutes

9

there.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the first part of

11

your answer is that -- that the state -- the

12

state governments, the municipal governments

13

are going to provide this information to -- to

14

the Department of Homeland Security?

15

MS. WANG:

That is what Congress

16

anticipated when it wrote this statute in '96,

17

yes.

18
19
20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And is that what is

happening now?
MS. WANG:

Your Honor, it's largely

21

what is happening now.

The government cites

22

some data from 1996.

23

cited that show that, in fiscal years '15

24

through '17, 94 percent of federal requests to

25

state and local jurisdictions were complied

There's also data we've

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

with.

2

But -- but I think the larger point,

3

Justice Alito, is that Congress -- we have to

4

read what Congress was doing in 1996.

5

whatever's happening today with controversies

6

over so-called sanctuary jurisdictions don't

7

really shed light on what Congress wanted in

8

'96.

9
10
11

And

What does shed light on what Congress
wanted in '96 is what they actually enacted.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and what they

12

enacted was a provision that says the Attorney

13

General, now, the Secretary shall take into

14

custody any alien who satisfies certain

15

requirements when the alien is released.

16

MS. WANG:

Yes, Your Honor.

And to

17

the extent Congress was thinking about state

18

and local cooperation, they dealt with that

19

through the other three statutes I mentioned

20

and through automated fingerprinting, and

21

communication between feds and state and local

22

jurisdictions.

23

I'd note, finally, Justice Alito, that

24

-- that the Court dealt with similar parallel

25

arguments by the government in the Pereira and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

Moncrief cases, and the Court said, look, the

2

government can point to these practical

3

considerations, but at the end of the day,

4

we're looking at the words that Congress wrote.

5

And the practical considerations that

6

pertain in the current environment in 19 -- in

7

-- sorry, 20 -- 2018 don't really shed light.

8

If -­

9
10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Ms. Wang, on

the -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

But we have to decide

12

whether "when the alien is released" means, as

13

you say, as the Ninth Circuit said,

14

immediately, within 48 hours, within some

15

reasonable period, or after the alien is

16

released.

17
18
19

In simple terms, that's the question
before us, right?
MS. WANG:

Yes, Your Honor.

And to

20

answer your question, I believe the Court

21

should affirm the Ninth Circuit, which, again,

22

said the government should act, shall take the

23

alien into custody with -- with a reasonable

24

degree of immediacy.

25

Now I note that the BIA, the Board of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

Immigration Appeals, in Rojas said 48 hours is

2

outside that time limit.

3

We think the same day would be

4

appropriate.

We -- we don't think if ICE shows

5

up to pick someone up on their release date and

6

they encounter them in the parking lot or at

7

the bus stop or -- or anywhere the same date, I

8

think that suffices and I think -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's wrong with

10

when a -- a reasonable time has been in the law

11

since Lord Cooke, I mean, and courts have

12

managed to deal with it.

13

avoid these problems if we just say, when they

14

say on release, you say a reasonable time?

15
16

MS. WANG:

So why wouldn't we

That's exactly right,

Justice Breyer.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Ninth Circuit said that.

I'm not sure the

19

MS. WANG:

That's right.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is that

21

-- I mean, there's a difference between

22

"reasonable degree of immediacy" and

23

"reasonable time."

24

immediate is immediate.

25

reasonable degree of immediacy.

I -- I don't see how
You can't have a
If it's an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

hour later, it's not immediate.

2

Now which are you arguing for,

3

reasonable degree of immediacy, which strikes

4

me as a very short time, or a reasonable time?

5

Reasonable time would depend, for example, on

6

the resources that are available to the

7

Department of Homeland Security.

8
9

It's not reasonable to -- to -- if
they don't have enough people to do it, if it

10

takes a week, if it takes -- I don't know

11

what's reasonable in this situation.

12

A month?

But a reasonable degree of immediacy

13

is something else.

That strikes me as a half

14

hour or something, because, otherwise, it's not

15

immediate.

16

MS. WANG:

I think -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So which is

18

it, reasonable degree of immediacy or

19

reasonable time?

20

MS. WANG:

Your Honor, I think that

21

the Ninth Circuit was using the phrase

22

"reasonable" with respect to a temporal scope,

23

not with respect to whether the government was

24

making reasonable efforts or acting in good

25

faith.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1
2

The statute says "when," which, as the
BIA acknowledged, connotes immediacy.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

Judge -- Judge Kayatta pointed out in his

5

opinion, "when" could be -- you know, if you're

6

saying it's not immediate, then who knows?

7

Maybe it's a year.

8

MS. WANG:

9

Yeah, but as

Maybe it's six months.
Well, Your Honor, I think

it would certainly not be in any sense of the

10

word "when released," "when the alien is

11

released."

12

Justice Breyer -­

13
14
15

A year would not suffice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

I think

Well,

can you give me a time?
MS. WANG:

Sure.

I think the same day

16

would be fine, Your Honor, and, as I noted, the

17

BIA said in the Rojas case, which the

18

government asks the Court to -- to defer to,

19

that -- that 48 hours is not within the scope

20

of the "when the alien is released" phrase.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So it

22

seems to me that reasonable time isn't really

23

giving any flexibility to the statute if you

24

say it has to be 48 hours.

25

MS. WANG:

Your Honor, we think 48

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47

hours is too long, as Rojas said.

2

Court -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

So you think it's the same day?

5

MS. WANG:

If the

Well, okay.

We -- we think it's the

6

same day, Your Honor.

7

just to -- to get to Justice Breyer's question,

8

there's no doubt -- and, again, the government

9

accuses -- accuses us of cherry-picking cases

10

If the Court -- I think,

in which the gap was long.

11

In fact, the -- the data the

12

government has provided in the companion case,

13

or the parallel case, of Gordon in the First

14

Circuit shows that years' delay is the mine run

15

of cases.

16

17

picking the person up is three years.

That data shows that the average

call it a year plus?

MS. WANG:

Justice Kagan, we didn't

2

here, which is that the government -- for

4

sometimes they put in a detainer and don't even

5

bother to show up?

6

MS. WANG:

7
8
9

Sotomayor.

That's right, Justice

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if there is a

difference, why are we marking a temporal limit

10

on what "reasonable effort to comply with the

11

statute" might mean?

12

Breyer's right, that the law is filled with the

13

reasonable effort to comply with the terms of a

14

command, but I don't see how we can set a

15

temporal limit to that reasonable effort in the

16

way that you're promoting.

17

MS. WANG:

It seems to me Justice

I think you can, Justice

18

Sotomayor, because, again, I'm trying to stay

19

true to the words Congress wrote.

20

used the phrase "when the alien is released,"

21

which clearly, as everyone acknowledges, has a

22

temporal component.

23

Congress

They didn't write a statute that

24

pegged mandatory detention to some kind of good

25

faith or reasonable effort standard for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

government.

2

And just to give a counter-example,

3

let's say the government -- and I want to say,

4

first, I agree with you, the record here, the

5

amicus brief filed by the Advancement Project

6

and other civil rights groups shows most of

7

these people who are picked up years later,

8

like Mr. Santos Rodriguez, who was detained

9

many years after he was released from criminal

10

custody at -- at home, these people are being

11

picked up, as Judge Kleinfeld in the Ninth

12

Circuit noted during oral argument, in front of

13

their house, mowing the lawn, at the job,

14

sometimes in an interview that they voluntarily

15

appear for with the agency.

16

So it's not a case where the

17

government is -- is, you know, dealing with

18

someone who's a fugitive, who's trying to hide.

19

MS. WANG:

I will quickly just get to

the -­

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Please.

6

MS. WANG:

7

So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the

-- cut to the chase.

8

statute Congress wrote speaks in temporal

9

terms.

And if the government, for whatever

10

reason, doesn't take custody when the alien is

11

released, we think same day is fine, then the

12

person gets a hearing under subsection (a).

13

And that's the only consequence, as Justice

14

Breyer noted.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

You've hinged

16

a lot on the language, and you've told us to

17

ignore what's happened after 1996 and, in

18

response to Justice Sotomayor, went back to

19

that language, "when the alien is released."

20

But, if we're going to focus really

21

carefully on the language, what do we do about

22

the fact that that is an adverbial phrase?

23

you're asking us to suggest that it modifies

24

the noun "alien" and limits the class of aliens

25

that are involved.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

"Alien" is a noun.

Adverbs don't

They usually modify

And the verb here is "shall take into

5

So why isn't it that the duty, "shall

6

take into custody," is modified by the adverb,

7

"when the alien is released," okay, and so the

8

government's obligation begins at that moment.

9

We know that's when the "shall take into

10

custody" duty starts.

11

the who, the noun, has nothing to do with the

12

adverb.

13

But the class of aliens,

Now that's the question my fifth grade

14

grammar teacher would have, all right?

15

I pose it to you.

16

MS. WANG:

And so

Well, I think I'm a

17

grammarian too.

18

Gorsuch, is that sometimes adverbial phrases do

19

describe a noun, just as they do in this

20

statute.

21
22

So, first, for all the reasons I've
already said -­

23
24
25

The reason why, Justice

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Usually they modify

the verb.
MS. WANG:

I'll -- I will -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So let's start

there.

3

MS. WANG:

-- I will concede that.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why should we -­

5

you're asking us to take a rather unusual view

6

of grammar, one I think I'd have to delve

7

pretty deep in the footnotes to find.

8

MS. WANG:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

So why would I do

that?

11
12

It wouldn't be the -­

MS. WANG:

It wouldn't be the first

time Congress tortured grammar, but -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

won't argue with you about.

15

MS. WANG:

This -- this, I

Right.

So -- so two -- two

16

reasons, Justice Gorsuch.

17

already said, I think it's clear from the

18

structure of the statute and the plain language

19

that Congress meant for people -- for -- for

20

paragraph (2), to -- to describe a subset of

21

people who were taken into custody in paragraph

22

(1).

23

flush language, as -- as my friend describes

24

it.

25

For the reasons I've

In all of paragraph (1), not omitting the

The second reason is, yes, it may be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

uncommon for an adverbial phrase to describe a

2

noun, but it can happen.

3

hypothetical example that -- that -- that

4

tracks this statute.

5

Let me give you a

I might tell you in a two-paragraph

6

instruction, number one, harvest the grapes in

7

vineyards A, B, and C when they ripen.

8

Paragraph two:

9

described in paragraph (1).

10

Make the wine from the grapes

The grapes refer to both the temporal

11

component, I want you to harvest them when

12

they're ripe, not when they're over-ripe, not

13

when they're under-ripe, and it's from those

14

three vineyards.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm not sure I -- I

16

mean, I follow the example, but I'm not sure I

17

buy it, and let me tell you why.

18

neat example.

I commend you.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And it's a

Well done.

I think -- I think

21

my fifth grade grammar teacher would love this

22

discussion, but I would say to you or I'd

23

challenge you with this, that, again, there

24

you're modifying the verb, when you're supposed

25

to harvest it, okay?

And that's the first -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

the first section.

2

The second section, you're saying,

3

okay, whatever you've harvested, the grapes

4

that we've described that you have harvested.

5

You still have to have harvested them.

6

still depends upon the verb in that second

7

paragraph, the verb plus the noun as referred

8

to in the second paragraph.

9
10
11

So it

So I'm not sure it gets around the
problem.

Help me out.
MS. WANG:

I -- I guess, Justice

12

Gorsuch, I think another way to put this is

13

that what the government's referring to as an

14

adverbial phrase could be rephrased as an

15

adjective.

16

brief about the red-headed man wearing the blue

17

jacket when he arrives on the 3:00 train from

18

New York, when he arrives on the 3:00 train

19

from New York is really a characteristic of the

20

man that's described.

21

The hypothetical we gave in our

In the same way, Your Honor, that I

22

think Congress in paragraph (2), again, by -­

23

by using the phrase "an alien described in

24

paragraph (1)," not an alien described in

25

paragraph (1)(A) through (D).

I think it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

simply -- the -- the whole, the entirety of

2

paragraph (1) describes the alien in that

3

paragraph (2) phrase.

4

that's simply what Congress meant.

5

And I think that's -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But Congress would

6

have known or thought that it wasn't going to

7

be immediate in many cases, correct?

8
9

MS. WANG:

Yes, Justice Kavanaugh.

And the consequence -­

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And -- and yet

11

Congress did not put in a time limit, whether

12

it's reasonable time, as Justice Breyer says,

13

or a year or two years or six months or 48

14

hours.

15

And so, when you combine those two

16

points, Congress knew it wouldn't be immediate,

17

and yet Congress did not put in a time limit.

18

That raises a real question for me whether we

19

should be superimposing a time limit into the

20

statute when Congress, at least as I read it,

21

did not itself do so.

22

How do you respond to that?

23

MS. WANG:

Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

24

we're not asking you to superimpose a time

25

limit.

We're asking you to give meaning to all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

the words of the statute that Congress enacted,

2

which say -­

3

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

4

MS. WANG:

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But you're -­

-- but -­
I'm sorry to

6

interrupt -- but, when you say "when," you are

7

saying that is, in essence, a time limit of

8

immediate, same day, I think you said.

9

And my point is that's very odd when

10

you think about what Congress was doing in

11

1996, because they were well aware that would

12

not happen, A, because of resources, B, because

13

they're not learning about it right away.

14

And it would be odd to think, okay,

15

that's what this statute means, even though it

16

would often not be effectuated in that way.

17

MS. WANG:

Well, Your Honor, I think,

18

again, Congress, first, as Justice Breyer

19

noted, Congress often will have kind of a soft

20

target when they legislate in this way.

21

Second, remember -­

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, the -- a

23

soft target would be what Justice Breyer might

24

say, reasonable time.

25

put that in, but -- and maybe we should,

And Congress could have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

Justice Breyer's idea, but Congress didn't do

2

that.

3

MS. WANG:

I think -- I think, Your

4

Honor, that Congress in saying "when" meant

5

what "when" means in the common sense, a

6

reasonable -- within a reasonable time of the

7

event happening.

8

We go to the dictionary definition -­

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

10

Well, in the

follow-up on -­

11

MS. WANG:

-- as Judge Breyer noted -­

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- the Chief

13

Justice's point, reasonable immediacy is

14

different from reasonable time in your view?

15

MS. WANG:

I think that the Ninth

16

Circuit used "reasonable degree of immediacy"

17

and "promptly" interchangeably.

18

the BIA again said, "when" connotes immediacy.

19

And as -- as

As Judge Baron pointed out, "when"

20

connotes immediacy.

That's the primary

21

dictionary definition.

22

to say one other thing in response to you,

23

Justice Kavanaugh, and that is remember that

24

subsection (c), mandatory detention without any

25

individual hearing, is written as an exception

But I do -- I do want

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

to subsection (a).

2

So the only consequence is you get a

3

hearing.

4

Breyer said, the "baddies," will be detained.

5

And I want to point out that the -­

6

And so the bad ones, as Justice

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The problem is

7

that Congress did not trust those hearings

9

MS. WANG:

10

But, Your Honor, the -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- a certain

11

class, is -- is my understanding, and correct

12

me if I'm wrong about that, but Congress was

13

concerned that those hearings were not working

14

in the way that Congress wanted and, therefore,

15

for a certain class of criminal or terrorist

16

aliens, said no more.

17

MS. WANG:

That's right.

But the

question here is what's the class, what's the

class.

Congress wrote the statute to say take
Otherwise,

And so the consequence is a

And I wanted to point out that the
bipartisan group, a former INS and DHS general

counsels, said at page 10 of their brief they

2

agree with our reading of the statute, and they

3

say:

4

meaningfully more burdensome for the

5

government.

Detention under Section 1226(a) is not

6
7

JUSTICE ALITO:
--

8
9

Yeah, I can see that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they

might agree, but every other circuit, four of

10

them, and an equally divided First Circuit,

11

disagree?

12

MS. WANG:

Well, some of the circuits,

13

Your Honor, deferred to the BIA's reading,

14

which the government's asking you partly to

15

defer to and partly not, since they disagree

16

with the BIA's reading of paragraph (1) but not

17

with paragraph (2).

18

And for -- and the Fourth Circuit

19

actually read the -- the Rojas decision

20

incorrectly and deferred on the "when release"

21

ground.

22

I think that the -- the First Circuit

23

panel in Judge Baron and the Ninth Circuit

24

below got this right.

25

meaning to every word in the statute.

That reading gives full

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It makes

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

sense of the two-paragraph structure and the

2

fact that (c) is written as an exception to

3

(a).

4

And I want to point out that, at the

5

time Congress wrote this statute, this Court

6

had never before approved of civil detention,

7

executive detention, without individualized

8

hearings on flight risk and danger.

9

And so the Court should -- Congress

10

should be presumed to have written that

11

provision narrowly.

12

and -- and Judge Baron pointed out, and I think

13

as Judge Breyer was alluding to, it's one thing

14

for the Court to say in Demore that the

15

government can constitutionally apply a

16

categorical and irrebuttable presumption -­

17

As -- as the Ninth Circuit

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Is that

18

presumption based on what we think was really

19

going through Congress's mind at the time, or

20

is it based on a constitutional overlay?

21

Because what was really going through

22

Congress's time in 1996 was harshness on this

23

topic.

24
25

Is that not right?
MS. WANG:

Congress was -- was

certainly trying to deal with what they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

considered to be a problem with non-citizens

2

who have committed crimes.

3

again, is who were they targeting with this

4

statute?

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

6

MS. WANG:

The question,

Right.

And I think that the words

7

that Congress chose are narrow ones.

They

8

clearly say that people had to be in criminal

9

custody under these four grounds, and there's a

10

serious constitutional problem if you buy the

11

government's reading.

12

My friend -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I can see the equities

14

when the alien has been free for a number of

15

years.

16

that this class of aliens was dangerous and

17

they should not be trusted.

18

unreliable.

19

requires their detention as soon as they get

20

out.

21

But Congress, wisely or not, thought

Bail hearings were

So you would say that this statute

Now why -- if that's the case, and it

22

-- it obviously is, why would Congress think

23

differently about someone who's been out for a

24

week?

25

MS. WANG:

For two reasons, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

Honor.

The first is the legislative history,

2

especially as -- as outlined in the members of

3

Congress dark green brief, makes it clear.

4

Congress wanted ICE, then INS, to

5

focus limited capacity, limited capacity to

6

detain, on people already in criminal custody

7

who would otherwise be released.

8

other words, don't spread yourself thin.

9

They said, in

My friend said it takes more effort to

10

go find people in the community.

11

exactly right.

12

--

That's

And that's the problem Congress

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MS. WANG:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

They face that -­

-- wanted to -­
-- but what would you

16

think of -- I see the problem of reasonable

17

time, but Demore concerned a case where the

18

Court thought that these people were detained

19

without bail hearings for less than six months.

20

Zadvydas interprets a silent statute

21

to imply a six-month limitation on other but

22

related holding of aliens.

23

think of reading this statute in order, in my

24

opinion, not to violate a principle that goes

25

back to if not -- not the Magna Carta, at least

So what would you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

to Blackstone, that we read this statute the

2

same way?

3

There it is.

We have a degree of

4

clarity.

We say -- we use -- we go to

5

Zadvydas, and we go to the history of bail and

6

we say, all right, six months.

7

MS. WANG:

Your Honor -- may I finish?

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MS. WANG:

Sure.

Your Honor, I think that,

10

Justice Breyer, the six months would be an

11

extraordinary amount of time and just gets a

12

little far afield from the words Congress

13

chose.

14

And I remind you that the Board of

15

Immigration Appeals said 48 hours was too long.

16

So, if the Court wishes to draw a bright line,

17

as you did in Zadvydas, I think that would be

18

fine.

19

Congress wrote.

But, really, we should follow the words

Wang.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3
4

MR. TRIPP:

Thank you.

Just a couple

of points.

5

The key question here is not the

6

meaning of "when."

7

described in paragraph (1)?

8

it's an alien, any alien with the requisite

9

criminal history.

10
11

It's who are the aliens
And the answer is

The time in is really not

relevant.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It just begs the

12

question, because they didn't say sub -­

13

paragraph (1), A through D.

14

entire paragraph.

15

MR. TRIPP:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They said the

That's right.

But as -­

And why isn't the

17

verb, the adverb, part of the noun in that

18

situation?

19

to that class of A to D, that's the easiest

20

thing to have done.

21

MR. TRIPP:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because, if they wanted to limit it

Because -­
Your counsel is -­

23

your adversary's right, if they wanted to limit

24

1226(a) to (c)(2), they would have said (c)(2).

25

MR. TRIPP:

So a couple of responses,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

but I think the main one is that the phrase

2

"when the alien is released" does not modify

3

who the alien is.

4

already been fully described.

5

--

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And instead that

No, it is -- it is

--

8
9

It takes as a given he's

MR. TRIPP:

-- just modifies the

duties of the Secretary.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're begging the

11

question.

When he's released identifies the

12

alien that the statute is looking at.

13

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You by yourself -­

15

you say that there's a command that you have to

16

follow to try to take these people into

17

custody.

18

but you don't have to do it.

19

not to do it.

20

command that is.

21

recognize that there's a sense of urgency, you

22

should do this.

You say there's a command to do it,
You can choose

I don't know what kind of
But you -- you at least

23

So why doesn't that describe the noun?

24

MR. TRIPP:

25

So I -- I think three

responses I'll just -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

verb, I should say.

3

MR. TRIPP:

The noun and the

So, first, we just don't

4

think it modifies who the alien is at all.

5

Second, even if you think that it

6

does, and there is some kind of timing

7

requirement, this Court has said again and

8

again and again that it's better to be late

9

than never.

And then A drives us home, right,

10

because it has two sentences:

11

about arrest and the second is about custody.

12

And it prohibits -- it has the exception for

13

(c).

14

about release is (c)(2).

And the only provision in (c) that talks
And that's the one -­

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

16

MR. TRIPP:

17
18

The first is

If -­

-- that categorically

prohibits release.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- if reasonable

19

amount of time, Justice Breyer's suggestion,

20

were part of a ruling, what do you think is a

21

reasonable amount of time or presumptively

22

reasonable?

23

position, but do you have thoughts on that?

24
25

I know that's not your preferred

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think our -- our

main answer is that would be really profoundly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

problematic because the gaps in custody are

2

often very long.

3

that -­

4

And -- and the basic reason

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So, therefore, you

5

would say a long period is a reasonable period,

6

but do you have any more meat you want to put

7

on those bones of what a reasonable period of

8

time would be, given all the circumstances?

9

MR. TRIPP:

I guess I -- I would say

10

that, I mean, what often happens is, you know,

11

once -- once an alien gets out, so I -- I think

12

this comes across in the -- in the brief, the

13

alien is often released before DHS is even

14

aware that that's going to happen, is even

15

aware that the person is one of these aliens.

16

And once the person's out, it's going

17

to be much more difficult to track them down.

18

DHS might not know where they -- where they

19

live, how to find them.

20

happens sometimes is that DHS doesn't become

21

aware of them again until years later when they

22

get arrested on a different offense.

23

And so, you know, what

And so I -- I think it's difficult for

24

me to give content to that.

I think the force

25

of that argument that, you know, maybe it would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

be different after the passage -­

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that -­

4
5

The problem is

MR. TRIPP:

-- of some long period of

time -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if that's the

7

only way you come -- that -- become aware of

8

them, they get arrested, you can hold them.

9

You can do what you should have done the first

10

time, which is to -­

11

MR. TRIPP:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13
14

But -- but -­
-- put a detainer

on them.
MR. TRIPP:

-- under -- under -- I

15

mean, so with Mr. Mony Preap, we did arrest him

16

just as he got out the second time, but that

17

second offense didn't trigger 1226(c).

18

he's arguing because he was out for years and

19

years before he got arrested the second time,

20

that he's off the hook.

21

And so

And I think -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I guess the

22

problem that I have is you're -- you're pitting

23

two groups of people.

24

there are people who are released on bail who

25

are dangerous and commit -- and commit serious

I'm not nay-saying that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

crimes.

2

But, if I look at the numbers that do

3

that, they're very, very small compared to the

4

people who are released on bail and don't

5

commit more crimes or the number of people who

6

get cancellation of removal for various

7

reasons.

8
9

At what point do we constitutionally
ignore that?

We ignore that there's a whole

10

class, a huge class of people who are being

11

held where no one would consider them

12

dangerous?

13
14

Or -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You may answer

briefly.

15

MR. TRIPP:

So none of those numbers

16

are in the record and I -- I don't think we

17

would agree with them.

18

fundamentally, this is a statutory

19

interpretation case.

20

unambiguous.

21

requisite criminal history, and every one of

22

Respondents has it, so we're asking the Court

23

to reverse.
