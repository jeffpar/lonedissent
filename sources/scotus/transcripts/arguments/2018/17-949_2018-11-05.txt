CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

Sturgeon versus Frost.

Mr. Findley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T. FINDLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. FINDLEY:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Mr. Sturgeon is asking that this Court

12

restore the balance that Congress struck when

13

enacting ANILCA.

14

represents a series of bargains and

15

compromises.

16

ANILCA is unique and

A centerpiece of this balancing was

17

ensuring that the over 18 million acres of

18

non-public lands and waters about to be

19

surrounded by the new ANILCA parks and

20

preserves would not be subject to a new array

21

of federal regulation.

22

Section 103(c) of the statute

23

preserved the status of these non-public lands

24

and waters by excluding them from ANILCA's

25

parks and preserves and specifically exempting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

them from park management regulation.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, but

3

ANILCA in many places puts statutory duties on

4

the government, on the Park Service.

5

example, the statute expands the Glacier Bay

6

National Monument.

7

shall be managed for the following purposes

8

among others, to protect a segment of the Alsek

9

River fish and wildlife habitats and migration

10

routes and a portion of the Fairweather Range.

11

So, for

It says that the monument

Or take another example.

ANILCA

12

creates the Kobuk Valley National Park, which

13

it says shall be managed for the following

14

purposes:

15

undeveloped state.

16

statutory duty to manage these parks for the

17

purpose of maintaining the Kobuk River, the

18

Alsek River, and other rivers.

19

among others, to keep it in an
So the agency has a

If the Park Service can't do what you

20

say, any regulation on these rivers, how can

21

the Secretary fulfill the statutory duties and

22

-- under ANILCA, unless it's under its organic

23

powers?

24
25

MR. FINDLEY:

ANILCA, as this Court

recognized in the first decision, specifically

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

invoked the Organic Act and said these parks

2

shall be managed in accord with the Organic Act

3

and in accord with the provisions of ANILCA.

4

And this Court recognized that ANILCA carries

5

many provisions specifically modifying the Park

6

Service's Organic Act authority, Section 103(c)

7

being one of them.

8
9

To your question, how can the Park
Service fulfill its duties:

In understanding

10

ANILCA and so understanding the debate about

11

ANILCA, it was very important what land went

12

into conservation system units, but it was

13

equally important what land did not get

14

included within conservation system units.

15

ANILCA was not just a park enabling

16

statute.

17

when it was -- first addressed ANILCA, it was

18

resolving multiple land use disputes within

19

Alaska.

20
21

As this Court recognized in Amoco

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You haven't

answered my question.

22

Under your theory, the state manages

23

all navigable waters between federal lands or

24

between state lands.

25

lands -­

And I mean not waters but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

MR. FINDLEY:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Yes.
-- in terms of the

territorial lands.

4

How does the Park Service engage in

5

its statutory obligations if it can't do what

6

you say?

7

MR. FINDLEY:

The Park Service, for

8

all those purposes, it can regulate submerged

9

lands and waters where title did not pass to

10

the state at statehood.

11

waters.

12

waters.

13

It can manage any non-navigable

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

waters.

15

belong to the state.

16

It can manage public

There's no public

Under your theory, all the waters

MR. FINDLEY:

Only navigable waters

17

where title to the submerged lands passed at

18

statehood.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

20

what you're saying is that a good portion of

21

the Act with all of the preservations of the

22

rivers that the Act imposes upon the Park

23

Service, it cannot do any of that work?

24
25

MR. FINDLEY:

It cannot do that work

on any of the specific navigable waters, but it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

can protect the watershed.

2

is a very good example of that.

3

Yukon-Charley -- again, think of the balancing

4

of ANILCA that this Court recognized -- some of

5

its conservation purposes is equally important

6

to balance the economic needs of the State of

7

Alaska.

8
9

The Yukon-Charley
The

The Yukon-Charley met goal number one
by putting 1.7 million acres of land into the

10

preserve to protect lakes, streams, and

11

watershed.

12

regulating those 1.7 million acres of public

13

lands that's regulated under the watershed that

14

protects the river.

15

And you protect the river by

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does it make any

16

difference that a park is designated as a wild

17

and scenic river?

18

MR. FINDLEY:

No, it does not, Your

19

Honor.

The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was even

20

specifically amended by ANILCA to make sure it

21

wasn't covering state land that goes into the

22

site of the river, and the Wild and Scenic

23

Rivers Act itself recognizes state ownership of

24

submerged lands.

25

Act, there's nothing about those designations

In the Wild and Scenic Rivers

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that undoes the central compromise that was

2

through 103(c).

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a quite

extreme -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you don't think it

6

makes any difference if there are public lands

7

on both sides of a river?

8

banks of a river are public lands, but still

9

the federal government cannot regulate the

10

In other words, both

river running through those lands?

11

MR. FINDLEY:

The federal government

12

may.

13

power that was not delegated to the Park

14

Service.

15

brings up in its brief is the Yukon-Kuskokwim

16

Wildlife Refuge.

17

provision directing that the Park Service may

18

not impede access to these rivers.

19

Particularly in that area of Alaska where there

20

are no roads, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim River

21

are the arteries of commerce that's helpful to

22

get to and from villages.

23

to vote.

24
25

The Park Service may not.

That was a

An example that even the Park Service

So there's a very specific

That's how they go

That's how to buy groceries.
And the specific mandate in ANILCA is

we are about to surround these highways with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

these federal lands, we're going to put them in

2

a conservation system unit, that's great, but

3

please do not block access to the highway.

4

that's the point of exempting the rivers.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So an agency

6

like EPA is -- is fully empowered to regulate

7

the waters?

8
9

MR. FINDLEY:
exactly right.

Yes, Your Honor, that's

The EPA, the Coast Guard, any

10

other federal, criminal -- all of these still

11

apply.

12

Park Service regulation that was not supposed

13

to apply once these lands and waters were

14

surrounded by the ANILCA parks.

It's just simply that extra layer of

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What does that do to

16

your federalism argument?

17

times in your brief, you press federalism

18

concerns.

19

have a lot of weight, if what you're really

20

saying is not this agency but that agency?

21

Because, at various

But I'm wondering, if those concerns

MR. FINDLEY:

When it comes to

22

interpreting the Organic Act, against Section

23

103(c), those aren't necessarily implicated,

24

although, as this Court recognized in the first

25

decision, the state's power over its navigable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

waters does raise significant issues of state

2

sovereignty.

3

a case of navigable waters, the refrain rings

4

throughout these cases that the state's

5

ownership of the submerged lands and control

6

and ownership of the resources within it is a

7

hallmark of state -- state sovereignty and a

8

hallmark of federalism.

9

And any time this Court addresses

Where the clear statement rule comes

10

into play is the Park Service's fallback

11

argument here, which is, well, if you look at

12

reserve water rights, this can turn these into

13

public lands and actually make these part of

14

the park.

15

And there's nothing in ANILCA that's a

16

clear statement saying we are going to take the

17

state's submerged lands, make them public

18

lands, and actually include them in the parks.

19

When we were here last time, we talked

20

about when that happens, the enabling statute

21

is very clear.

22

Ozette to the Olympic National Park actually

23

specifically said we are adding the submerged

24

lands to the park, so -­

25

And the statute that added Lake

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you just -­

it -- it -- you just don't like the Park

2

Service.

3

Army Corps of Engineers is fine with you, the

4

EPA is fine.

5

The Coast Guard is fine with you, the

But not the Park Service?

MR. FINDLEY:

It's not that we don't

like the Park Service, as it -- it's that layer

7

of regulation -­

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. FINDLEY:

10

to apply on top.

11

that's exactly right.

12

-- that was not supposed

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which sentence of

13

Section 3103(c) do you think wins this case for

14

you?

15

MR. FINDLEY:

The second sentence does

16

the most work, but the second sentence needs to

17

be read in conjunction with all three sentences

18

and in conjunction with the context of the

19

statute.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

I've

21

burned up an awful lot of gray cells trying to

22

put together the pieces of this statute.

23

you just take me through the second sentence

24

and explain why that wins the case for you?

25

MR. FINDLEY:

Thank you.

Could

So you -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

the first sentence of 103(c) has just told you

2

that any non-public land, whether it's state

3

land, submerged -- submerged lands, waters,

4

native corporation, or private land, it is not

5

going to be part of the park.

6
7

JUSTICE ALITO:
the park?

8
9
10

It's not a portion of

MR. FINDLEY:
the park.

It's not a portion of

It may be surrounded by the outer

boundaries, but it's not part of the unit.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and -- and, you

12

know, whether something can be within a unit

13

but not be a portion of the unit is kind of a

14

nice question.

15

slam-dunk answer to that one way or the other.

16

Would you agree?

17

I don't think there's a -- a

MR. FINDLEY:

I -- I would agree, but

18

the Court doesn't need to reach that issue.

19

the second sentence, it then says no lands

20

which on or before December 2, 1980, have been

21

conveyed to the state, native corporation, or

22

private person.

23

lands.

Again, shorthand, non-public

To

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. FINDLEY:

Right.
They shall not be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

subject to regulations applicable solely to

2

public lands within the units.

3

is telling you is not only are they not part of

4

the unit, they may not be regulated as though

5

they were.

6

And what that

And that's the function of the word

7

"solely," is to distinguish between park

8

management regulations and the regulations Mr.

9

Chief Justice was talking about, Coast Guard,

10

EPA and -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how does it do

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I can just ask one

12

that?
When -­

16

more question related to this.

17

that lands is defined by ANILCA to include

18

water and waters and interests therein, but the

19

second sentence after referring to lands then

20

refers to a conveyance, which I take it means

21

the transfer of title.

22
23
24
25

I understand

And nobody really has title to
navigable waters.

So what do we do with that?

MR. FINDLEY:
parts to that.

The -- there are two

First of all, the submerged

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

lands were conveyed to Alaska.

2

Lands Act was specifically included within the

3

Statehood Act.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

MR. FINDLEY:

The Submerged

Right.
In terms of having title

6

to water, this Court has, in U.S. v.

7

California, and PPL Montana, certainly

8

suggested with very strong language that, with

9

the Submerged Lands Act, with title to the

10

submerged lands, and with ownership and control

11

of all the resources within there, that is

12

effectively title to the waters.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I mean as to the

14

public lands.

15

mean, lands are defined the same way.

16

include water.

17

in the United States, but the United States

18

does not have title to navigable waters, is

19

that right?

20
21
22
23
24
25

So public lands are defined -- I

Public means, I take it, title

MR. FINDLEY:
right.

They

That is definitely

And they don't claim so here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask you to go

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Justice Kagan?

Could I ask you to go

3

back to the applicable -- regulations

4

applicable solely to public lands?

5

suggested that that language is what

6

distinguishes Park Service regulations from,

7

let's say, EPA regulations.

And you

8

But, when I read that language,

9

"regulations applicable solely to public

10

lands," it seems to be making a distinction

11

between regulations that apply solely,

12

exclusively to public lands and those that

13

apply more broadly to both public and private

14

lands.

15

That seems to be the distinction this

16

makes on its face.

17

get how -- how you make it into something

18

different.

19

So I guess I don't quite

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes.

And Mr. Sturgeon's

20

position, as with the state, is that "solely"

21

distinguishes between the generally applicable

22

regulations that we talked to Mr. Chief Justice

23

about, Coast Guard, EPA, and so on, and park

24

management regulations.

25

If you were to take the word "solely"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

out of the statute, you would have

2

inadvertently exempted these lands from a

3

myriad of other federal regulation that applied

4

before ANILCA and that was certainly intended

5

to apply -- apply after ANILCA.

6

If you look, I mean, the Park Service

7

in its argument about Section 103(c) and

8

argument -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MR. FINDLEY:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but -- but -­
Go ahead.
But I guess solely to

12

public lands, is like if you take out the -- if

13

you take out the word "solely," this -- this is

14

saying solely to public lands as compared to

15

what, as compared to -- to public lands and

16

something else, meaning non-public lands.

17

that seems to be the distinction it's drawing:

18

solely to public lands, or to public lands and

19

something else, non-public lands.

20

MR. FINDLEY:

And

The sentence needs to

21

have meaning beyond articulating what is

22

already true.

23

only to apply to public lands, it already only

24

applies to public lands.

25

has to have meaning.

If a regulation is promulgated

That second sentence

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

And if it doesn't prohibit the Park

2

Service from issuing the exact regulation at

3

issue here, which is a regulation designed to

4

touch both public and non-public land, that

5

sentence actually doesn't prohibit anything.

6

It needs to have prohibitive effect.

7

If you want to understand its

8

prohibitive effect, you look at this came into

9

the statute, it was not a last-minute technical

10

addition.

11

Representative Seiberling a year and a half

12

before ANILCA was passed, and he specifically

13

said the fact that these non-public lands were

14

within the units drawn on the map does not

15

change the status of that state native for

16

private land.

17

It was introduced in the House by

And that goes back to, if we're about

18

to surround these lands with the parks, they

19

were already subject to a rich matrix of

20

federal regulations before ANILCA.

21

going to subject them to any new array of

22

federal regulation merely because of them being

23

surrounded by the park.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

You are not

I -- I understand what

-- I think it's a good point, the point you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

make about, look, if it were public lands

2

versus public and non-public lands, this would

3

not be doing very much.

4

But I guess what I want to know from

5

you is, like, why pick this language to convey

6

what you want to convey?

7

to manipulate this language to get it to mean

8

what you want it to mean?

9
10

MR. FINDLEY:

I mean, how do I have

I can't answer why

Congress chose those specific words.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, I mean, what -­

12

what -- what could you do to this language to

13

make it more like what you're suggesting it

14

means?

15

just doesn't say -- it's just not anywhere

16

close to what you're saying it means.

17
18
19

Because I look at this language, it

MR. FINDLEY:

I mean, we believe the

20

about that.

21

struggling with this.

22

MR. FINDLEY:

But maybe I'm wrong

I really am trying -- I'm

If the language weren't

23

read in context with all three sentences, and

24

read in context with the statute, the meaning

25

becomes clearer.

And perhaps in hindsight they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

could have written something about applicable

2

solely to land, you know, solely land

3

management power, but what your -- the "solely"

4

is drawing that distinction of the regulations

5

that only could come into play after the

6

passage of ANILCA.

7

in mind that, without provisions like

8

Section 103(c), there is no ANILCA.

9

no ANILCA parks.

10

And it's important to keep

There are

And the -- the large debate, it took

11

two years to pass the statute, there were

12

issues relating to the Native Claims Settlement

13

Act, there were issues related to the Statehood

14

Act, and it was a very large debate, that this

15

Court recognized in Amoco, of what lands will

16

go into a conservation system unit and be

17

subject to much more rigorous conservation

18

regulations and which lands will not go into

19

these things.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did the -- the

Park Service had no -- no regulatory authority

over these areas prior to ANILCA or -­

None.

That's correct.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH BOTSTEIN FOR ALASKA,

18

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Understanding ANILCA requires

22

understanding remote Alaska.

In most of the

23

state, a vast wilderness that is more than

24

twice the size of Texas, our rivers are our

25

only roads.

When Congress surrounded many of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

these crucial state waterways with federal park

2

areas, it consciously chose not to take away

3

state control over these crucial rivers.

4

Instead, Congress left them under

5

state control as part of its commitment to

6

providing adequate opportunity for satisfaction

7

of the economic and social needs of the State

8

of Alaska and its people.

9

This Court should reject the Park

10

Service's continuing attempts to commandeer

11

control of Alaska's navigable waters, because

12

that is not what Congress intended.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well,

14

"commandeer" is strong language, but what -­

15

what do you say for the -- the Park Service's

16

argument that, with respect to their reserved

17

water rights and so on, that you would be

18

creating a checkerboard sort of situation where

19

the Park Service has authority with respect to

20

some areas but not others along -- along the

21

river?

22

MS. BOTSTEIN:

It is true that within

23

these park areas there are areas of mixed

24

jurisdiction.

25

because it created islands of private and

Congress absolutely knew that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

native corporation land that were beyond the

2

reach of park management regulation and,

3

similarly, with the waters.

4

And that's consistent with the default

5

way that water management is done.

6

Montana mandates a segment-by-segment

7

navigability analysis.

8

waters, there is a mixed jurisdiction.

9

I mean, PPL

So, even along large

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That -­

But what

10

authority would you say that the Park Service

11

has?

12

respect to the river.

13

apart from inholdings, has authority with

14

respect to the land.

I mean, you're asserting authority with

15
16

The Park Service in,

How do you resolve conflicts that are
inevitably going to arise?

17

MS. BOTSTEIN:

What Congress did was

18

mandated cooperative management as a primary

19

management tool in these parks, so -- and this

20

gets back to the first question from the Court.

21

Justice Sotomayor asked how can the Park

22

Service fulfill its statutory mission if it

23

doesn't have title to all the lands and the

24

waters.

25

What Congress said is you work

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

together and create a management plan for each

2

area, identify areas of concern on public and

3

non-public land, and work with landowners and

4

the State of Alaska to try to cooperatively

5

resolve those conflicts because Congress knew

6

it wasn't giving sole and exclusive

7

jurisdiction to the federal government.

If there's any doubt about that, Your
Honor -­

19

same time reserves some rights to the state,

20

doesn't the federal government's obligation to

21

do this, the explicit obligation to deal with

22

certain rivers in a particular way, trump any

23

other exemption that you might have?

MS. BOTSTEIN:

No, Your Honor, because

the statutory mission is limited to regulation

or native corporations.

specifically named in the statute.

10

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Many of these rivers are

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And your position

11

or your co-counsel's position is that all of

12

these rivers belong to the state?

13

MS. BOTSTEIN:

The navigable rivers

14

that were state -- that were not federal owner

15

-- in ownership that passed to the state under

16

the Submerged Lands Act, yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we have a

18

problem with whether you can own navigable

19

waters, but that's a different issue.

20

MS. BOTSTEIN:

What Congress did, Your

21

Honor, was said -- you know, when Congress

22

names the rivers as part of a watershed, in

23

part what it's saying is, on the public lands,

24

your statutory mission is to regulate in a way

25

that protects these watersheds, protects access

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

to the watersheds, protects the watersheds,

2

but, at the same time, it is the state that has

3

jurisdiction over the water themselves.

4

And if there's any doubt about this,

5

if you look through Title 16, when Congress

6

created different national parks, it used

7

vastly different jurisdictional language.

8
9

When Congress created Yellowstone,
which Justice Breyer mentioned, this is what it

10

said:

11

boundaries now are defined or as they may

12

hereinafter be defined or extended, shall be

13

under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of

14

the United States.

15

The Yellowstone National Park, as its

That's a very clear statement that

16

says we drew a circle and everything within it

17

is federal; the Park Service can manage it.

18

does violence to Congress's differing intent to

19

interpret Section 103(c) to mean the same as

20

what -- sole and exclusive federal

21

jurisdiction.

22

It

And Congress had very good reasons for

23

giving Alaska more sovereign power, reserving

24

more sovereign power to Alaska than it did to

25

Wyoming, because this statute is not a pure

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

conservation statute.

2

that fulfills the promises made to Alaska at

3

statehood and in the Native Claims Settlement

4

Act about local control and self-sufficiency

5

designed by Alaskans.

6

This is also a statute

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm having a hard

7

time accepting your position in this case with

8

your position that the Katie John decisions

9

should be retained.

I don't know how we can

10

give different meaning to public lands in two

11

provisions of the same Act.

12

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Your Honor, giving

13

effect to Congress's intent in ANILCA does -­

14

may require preserving the rural subsistence

15

priority in Title 8 of the legislation, even if

16

it does require a different statutory

17

definition.

18

Now no party has challenged the

19

current federal subsistence management -­

20

subsistence regulations.

21

certainly reflects this is an issue of great

22

concern to the people of Alaska and its rural

23

residents.

24

those settled expectations of Alaskans today.

25

The briefing

And the Court should not upset

A different definition in these titles

Heritage Reporting Corporation

does reflect Congress's very different intent

in Title 8.

3

statute.

4

It has its own -- it is the only place in this

5

extensive law where Congress specifically

6

exercised its commerce power.

7

Title 8 could have been its own

It has its own statement of purpose.

And it has a federal takeover

8

provision that says Congress was so concerned

9

that there be an -- an enforceable subsistence

10

priority that it gave explicitly the federal

11

government the right to regulate that if the

12

state could not, which is how it played out.

13

So we don't think the Court needs to

14

resolve this issue today, but we do ask that

15

the Court leave some space open for those to be

16

differently interpreted -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MS. BOTSTEIN:

19

One could -­

-- in accordance with

Congress's intent.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if one defines

21

them the same, but not in accordance with your

22

views, but in accordance with the government's

23

current view, and the Katie law decisions

24

view -­

25

MS. BOTSTEIN:

The statute -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- then you don't

win here.
MS. BOTSTEIN:

The statute does

4

contain one definition.

We've cited to the

5

Court in our brief cases that do suggest, in

6

these long complicated statutes, we do look to

7

Congress's intent in the context of the

8

statute, and that can mean that a term does

9

have different meaning in different sections

10

when that is what Congress intended.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why isn't an -­

12

all of the references to the government's

13

control of rivers in this Act a similar

14

statement of purpose?

15

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Because those need to

16

be read in the context of 103(c), which doesn't

17

say the federal government can come in and

18

regulate these rivers if we don't compel and

19

ask them to do that.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or regulate

21

subsistence living, but you're arguing that the

22

purpose of the statute is reflected in its

23

structure and words.

24

words here are giving the government defined

25

statutory duties for any number of rivers

And the structure and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

within this compound.

2
3

So it -- I don't see the difference in
the logic.

4

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Your Honor, the

5

statutory duties that the Park Service is

6

given, is delegated to regulate for

7

non-subsistence purposes, is limited by Section

8

103(c) -­

11
12
13
14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
MS. BOTSTEIN:

You agree -­

-- and that is a

meaningful restriction.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You agree with the

Katie John decisions, correct?
MS. BOTSTEIN:

We are not challenging

15

the federal subsistence management regulations

16

that were mentioned.

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Do you -- do you

18

-- does the State of Alaska agree with those

19

decisions?

20

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Your Honor, the

21

reasoning of those decisions may be appropriate

22

to -- for the limited purpose of effectuating

23

Title 8 but should not be expanded to change

24

the federal reserved water rights doctrine

25

throughout the circuit for all purposes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

And, certainly, Congress had good

2

reasons for treating Alaska differently than

3

other states in the main body of the statute

4

because this comes back to the Congress's

5

special solicitude for Alaska and its

6

uniqueness, which are concerns this Court spoke

7

about in its 2016 opinion.

8
9

This is not a situation where we're
talking about tourists who might be disturbing

a wilderness area.

11

people are living and working along these

rivers and using them for transportation, for

13

commerce, for fishing.

This is a situation where

states were given -- if -- if I may finish my

sentence, Your Honor?

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MS. BOTSTEIN:

Sure.

These are exactly the

19

reasons that states were given control of their

20

submerged lands under the Submerged Lands Act.

And Congress wanted to effectuate those

22

purposes in this statute.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4
5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice -­

excuse me -- and may it please the Court:
I'd like to identify at the outset two

6

statutes that have not been discussed which we

7

think are very important to understand the

8

provisions of ANILCA at issue here.

9

The first is a general statute enacted

10

in 1976 and added to the Park Service's general

11

authorities, which is reproduced in our -- in

12

our brief at page 8a, and it says the

13

Secretary, under such terms and conditions, et

14

cetera, will have the authority to issue

15

regulations concerning boating and other

16

activities on or relating to water located

17

within system units.

18

That is a general authority, contrary

19

to Petitioner's argument, that specifically

20

delegates to the Park Service, along with the

21

Coast Guard, power to regulate navigable waters

22

in the national park system.

23

So the question here is whether that

24

was somehow abrogated when it comes to Alaska.

25

And I think the answer to that question is in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

another provision that -- that is not

2

mentioned.

3
4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Kneedler, before

we get to the abrogation question -­

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- I'd just like to

7

understand your argument on the terms of -- of

8

the '76 Act itself a little bit better.

9

says the Secretary may prescribe regulations

It

10

concerning boating and other activities on or

11

relating to water within system units.

12

paraphrasing, but I think that's about it.

13

And I'm

And I'd understand your argument

14

better, I think, if the -- if the statute read

15

that the Secretary could regulate water in or

16

relating to system units, so not just water

17

within system units but also water outside

18

system units, like the water here that might

19

have some downstream effect, say.

20

But that's not what the statute says.

21

It says that the -- it may prescribe

22

regulations concerning boating or other

23

activities that themselves relate to water in

24

system units.

25

So I would think that the government

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

would have to prove some nexus between boating

2

or the other activities and the water within

3

the government's system units.

4

didn't see that story told here, how Mr.

5

Sturgeon's hovercraft would in some way impact

6

water within the system units, meaning public

7

-- public lands, public waters.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Okay.

And I just

So if -- if I

could answer that, the -- that, I think, does

go to the abrogation question.

for the -- for the moment that I'm -- I'm -­

All right?
What's your argument then?

Do you

have one?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, non-navigable

8

waters -- I mean, first of all, we're talking

9

in -- in this instance about a -- a river that

10

runs through federal lands on both sides.

11

it's -- it's been determined to be navigable,

12

but it is -- it is within the federal -- the

13

federal bounds.

14

And

It may be -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

If I don't

15

buy that argument, then do you have anything

16

left?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it would -- it

18

would affect the non-navigable waters within

19

the area.

20

river that would be non-navigable under this

21

Court's decision in PPL.

There could be stretches of the

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's not -- I

23

guess that doesn't help me either.

24

wondering whether you have any argument that

the use of the hovercraft outside the system

I'm

units, boating activity outside the system unit

2

-- premise me -- work on that premise -- would

3

have any effect on the water within the system

4

unit?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- it has -­

6

it has -- a hovercraft could have -- they're

7

very loud, they're unsightly, and I don't -- I

8

don't read this to say that the effect has to

9

be on the water.

10

The purpose of giving the regulation,

11

regulatory authority to the Park Service is to

12

enable it to fulfill the purposes of the park

13

as a whole, not just the waters.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Do we know from the

record that the hovercraft could be heard

within the system unit itself?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

But if I could go to the second

2

statutory provision I wanted -- wanted to cite,

3

this is in 410hh-2 that we cite in our brief,

4

again, against the backdrop of the 1976

5

statute, it says "the Secretary shall

6

administer the lands, waters, and interests

7

therein added to existing areas or established

8

by the foregoing sections of ANILCA" -- the one

9

that lists the parks -- "in accordance with the

10

Organic Act as amended and supplemented."

11

other words, in accordance with the general

12

authorities, which includes the 1976 Act.

13

In

This provision, far from abrogating

14

the Secretary's authority, confirms that with

15

respect to the waters that were added to the -­

16

to the parks, to the park system -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

Okay.

I've got -­

-- the Secretary can

invoke the 1976 Act.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your point here,

21

which we'll hear something about probably on

22

rebuttal, is that there's some other statutes

23

here that, whatever it says in -- in 103(c),

24

give direct authority to the Secretary to do

25

this.

I see where you're driving at.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

But I'd like to go back to 103(c)

2

because the question that Justice Kagan asked

3

was a question that was in my mind too, and it

4

is to do with the word "solely."

5

And either they -- he can answer this

6

on rebuttal too if he wants.

Imagine something

7

like Yellowstone, not perfectly, but it's a

8

square and it is mostly -- it's federal, but

9

there are a few houses belonging to Smith and

10

Jones that are private, and the -- pass a

11

statute, a reg, and the reg says:

12

bonfires within the boundaries of the park,

13

which means Smith can't do it either.

14

Oh, no

Now is that a reg that is a reg solely

15

relating to lands to which the U.S. has title?

16

Well, I can -- the argument that it couldn't

17

possibly be for the purposes of this statute is

18

you wouldn't need -- you wouldn't need sentence

19

2 at all if that were the case.

20

wouldn't need it, period, because it wouldn't

21

apply to the river regardless because it says

22

it wouldn't.

23

You just

Okay?

So sentence 2 must have some purpose.

24

And, therefore, when the national park system

25

has a reg which says "applies within the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

boundaries of a national park," that is a rule

2

that relates only to public lands.

3

doesn't -- see, without that, this is

4

meaningless, and so it must mean that, and so

5

it must be that that kind of thing is what you

6

can't do to enclaves within public lands in

7

this area.

8

because it is not a piece of property to which

9

the United States has title.

And if it

And the river is such an enclave

10

Now that, I think, is their argument.

11

I've had a hard time grasping the arguments in

12

this case, but I think that that is their

13

argument.

14
15
16

If I am right, what's the answer to
it, if there is one?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There are a number of

17

answers to that, and there -- there are several

18

respects in which 103(c), the second sentence,

19

is inapplicable.

20

Perhaps the most basic is the fact

21

that 103(c), that second sentence, refers to -­

22

excuse me -- refers to land -- no lands which

23

have been conveyed to a state.

24
25

The -- the Submerged Lands Act
conveyed to the state only submerged lands and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

interests in waters.

2

waters themselves.

3

It did not convey the

And so that -- so the second sentence

4

of 103(c) does not affect the Park Service's

5

regulation of navigable waters, which -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I got that one.

Is

7

there another one?

Because that one, I don't

8

know if water is stuff you could convey and I

9

don't know art.

10

But -- but is there another one?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

No, Justice, if I could

just finish my point.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm not -­
No, that -- that's -­

15

that's critical to the point I was making

16

before, that the 1976 Act is one of general

17

applicability, specifically giving the

18

Secretary the authority to regulate waters,

19

including navigable waters.

20

And the other statute I mentioned

21

specifically says that the Secretary may

22

regulate the waters added to these park units

23

according to the general authorities, which

24

includes the '76 Act, and that ties directly to

25

the fact that the waters, the navigable waters,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

were not conveyed to the state, and, therefore,

2

the Secretary's regulatory authority over such

3

waters is not -- is not affected at all by the

MR. KNEEDLER:

be useful to distinguish two different types of

United States.

19

the issue here was -- that was different about

20

Alaska was that, within the outer boundaries,

21

there were lands selected by the state or

22

selected by native corporations, and Congress

23

did not want them to be administered just like

24

the Park Service lands themselves, the -- the

25

usual Park Service lands.

The one were the inholdings, so

It wanted them to be

The other category -- and that is -­

that is what the legislative history that the

Well, it -­

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's -- it's well -­

it's well established under -- under the

10

navigational servitude and -- and, in fact, the

11

Submerged Lands Act preserves to Congress the

12

ability to regulate in the interest of

13

commerce.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

it's plenary then, right?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

So it's plenary -­

I -- I -- I -- it's -­

17

it's pretty close to plenary, but this Court

18

has recognized that there is -- but the

19

Secretary hasn't exercised it to that degree,

20

but -- but the -- this Court has recognized in

21

cases involving navigable water that the fact

22

that the state owns the submerged lands does

23

not interfere with Congress's ability to

24

regulate the waters themselves.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

about if Alaska decided to, you know, build a

bridge across the river and things like that.

I don't know that it reaches as far to justify

any type of regulation on -- on the water.

They -- what they don't agree is that

that is a lever that gives you authority to do

this sort of day-to-day regulation, such as,

you know, the hovercraft traffic.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there are -­

11

there are -- there are a number of instances

12

within the Act in which Congress has

13

specifically required the Secretary to

14

accommodate, to take into account what's

15

different about Alaska, by requiring them to

So am I to -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I summarize

2

what I think you said?

3

103(c) basically, because of the navigational

4

servitude, the other regulations you've pointed

5

to, doesn't permit the government to regulate

6

activities on the territorial lands or -- or on

7

the submerged lands, but it does give it

8

basically plenary authority over navigable

9

waters?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Are you saying that

I -- I hesitate to say

11

plenary.

I think it gives it -- it preserves

12

for the -- through the Park Service whatever

13

the scope of authority that -- that Congress

14

would have or the federal government has over

15

navigable waters.

16

The uplands are very different -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're

18

basically saying, whatever the regulations were

19

under the Organic Act or even under this Act,

20

and charging you with taking care of certain

21

parks, that the navigable waters are part of

22

that charge?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

The uplands are

24

different, and that's really what drove 103(c),

25

was to make sure that these land selections

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

were not going to be subject to the general

2

regulations of the Park Service.

3

And, in fact, that's been exactly

4

true.

There -- there are -- there are really

5

only three sets of regulations that the Park

6

Service has applied in -- outside of federally

7

owned lands.

8

navigable waters pursuant to an express

9

statutory authorization in the '76 Act.

One is the regulation of

The

10

other two have to do with the regulation of

11

solid waste pursuant to a specific statutory

12

directive to regulate within the boundaries of

13

national park units, just like this statute

14

talks about within system units, and the other

15

is mining in areas of the national park system,

16

which the Park Service has applied regulations

17

there.

18

statutory directives.

19

All three pursuant to specific

20
21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your -- you

think -­
MR. KNEEDLER:

The Park Service has

not done more than that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so you

24

think the state's argument works with respect

25

to solid land, land land?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there is -­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's -- it's

3

only because you don't think that water is

4

included in public lands that their argument

5

doesn't work?

6
7

MR. KNEEDLER:
it's because -­

8
9

No, their -- well,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's only

because it is water?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

conveyed to the state.

12

argument.

13

Water -- water was not
That's the first

The second argument is, if you have a

14

regulation that, in the case -- examples I

15

mentioned, regulations issued pursuant to

16

statutory directive to apply to both public and

17

non-public lands within the national park, that

18

comes within the reference they are not

19

regulations applicable solely to public lands

20

and -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's -­

22

that's the -- that's one of your arguments that

23

causes me concern, because you're saying that

24

if the regulation applies to the -- the private

25

or state land, then it is not a regulation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

solely applicable to public land and,

2

therefore, it's not covered.

3

But the -- the sentence is obviously

4

designed to protect the state, the natives, and

5

the private landholders against the federal

6

government or the Park Service to whatever

7

extent we can debate.

8

Park Service has to do to get around it is say,

9

oh, and this applies to the inholdings, that

10
11

But to say that all the

can't be right.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I'm not saying -­

12

I'm not -- in fact, I would disclaim the

13

proposition that the Park Service could treat

14

them as -- as -- as -- the same way it treats

15

regular Park Service lands.

16

And the only examples where it has issued

17

regulations that go beyond that are pursuant to

18

specific statutory directive, of which the 1976

19

Act regulating waters is one.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It cannot do that.

Now that's -­

But, if I understand

21

your view, Mr. Kneedler, what you're saying

22

this means is that non-public lands shall not

23

be subject to regulations that are applicable

24

only to public lands.

25

And you don't need a statute to tell

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

you that.

2

subject to regulations applicable solely to

3

public lands.

4

saying, who would need a statute?

5

Of course, non-public lands aren't

If that's what the statute was

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I think the

6

purpose of the statute -- and, again, I think

7

this comes through in the legislative history

8

that -- that is cited on the other side -- the

9

native groups were concerned, and as was the

10

state, that because large tracts of land that

11

they had selected were going to be included

12

within the -- in the -- within the outer

13

boundaries, that they were not going to be -­

14

that they would be treated just like -- they

15

wanted assurance that they wouldn't be treated

16

just like Park Service.

17

And that's what this did.

It's

18

important to recognize that this is subsection

19

(c) of a section that deals with maps.

20

isn't -- it doesn't -- you would think if there

21

was some major substantive change -- work that

22

this was supposed to do aside from the

23

substantive regulations, it would appear

24

elsewhere.

25

It

And there may be -- I think it -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just on the face

2

of things, Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the Park

3

Service issues a regulation and the regulation

4

says this applies only to public lands within a

5

park, right, and you're not a public land

6

within a park, you're a private land within a

7

park, what kind of assurance do you need?

8

It's like you know that you're not a

9

public land, so it doesn't matter that you're

10

in the park.

11

to tell you that, do you?

12

special statute if the special statute exempts

13

you from something that would otherwise apply

14

to you.

15

You don't need a special statute

MR. KNEEDLER:

You only need a

With all respect, I

16

don't think that's correct.

17

-- I think that there was a lot of debate about

18

-- about different versions of the statute.

19

And I -- and I think if you -- if you recall,

20

as I said, this was in a section dealing with

21

maps, and the statute required that the -- that

22

the -- that the lot -- the boundaries -- that

23

maps be published identifying what the parks

24

were.

25

I think that the

Those maps might have -- and -- and,

in fact, I think did -- just outline the outer

2

boundaries.

yeah, that -- that may be the boundaries of

that it's only -- it's only the public lands

In other words, if you -- the -- the

21

-- the Secretary, feels that you need to have

22

authority over areas that you don't, it tells

23

you in -- in the third sentence how to do it:

24

get the state or the native corporation to

25

convey it to you.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

That would be an odd sentence to

2

include if this were not -- if this were a -- a

3

-- a protection you could write around just by

4

saying, oh, and, by the way, this applies to

5

the -- the inholders.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- I don't think

7

so at all.

I mean, I think -- I think this

8

provision was in there because if the -- if you

9

had native or state selected lands or native

10

lands, the corporation -- the native

11

corporation, they were -- if they decided to

12

sell their land, this just says that the Park

13

Service could purchase it.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you -- let me go

15

back to this question because this is obviously

16

the question that's bothering some of us, okay?

17

And it seems to me you sort of

18

answered it both ways.

You're not -- I -- I

19

started out thinking that if a reg applies to

20

Mr. Smith's inholding in Yosemite because it

21

applies to all of Yosemite, that that is solely

22

public lands.

23

Why?

Because if the only things that

24

count as a reg for public lands -- we've said

25

this three times -- are -- are those regs that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

say they don't apply to Smith's inholding, you

2

don't need this statute, okay?

3

basic thing.

4

That's the

Now some of what you said seems to

5

agree with that and some of it does not.

6

what I took your basic arguments to be, one,

7

that water, unlike Mr. Smith's cabin, is close

8

enough to public lands that it's out of this

9

thing.

10

But

Two, even if it isn't, there are other

11

statutes that give specific authority to the

12

government to regulate the water.

13

them might be general.

14

the ones you just started off your argument

15

with.

16

There are two or three on that.

And one of

One of them might be

One of them might be -- I don't know.

17

Now I think I've got this very helpful

18

argument right at least to what you're arguing.

19

And is there something else, or do I have it so

20

wrong it's hardly worth answering?

21
22

MR. KNEEDLER:
it's -­

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

No, I -- I think

-- I think it's

basically correct, but there is the category of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

regulations that are not applicable solely to

2

public lands because -- because they have been

3

made applicable to inholdings within the Park

4

Service.

5

Whether or not that's valid in any

6

particular case is a different matter, but

7

there are three, as I mentioned, that were done

8

pursuant to statutory authorization, and those,

9

I think, must be valid because Congress has

10

authorized them.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I

think -­

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

involved here.

15

waters which were not -­

16

But that is not really

Here, we're only talking about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel,

17

Justice Alito has been trying to ask a

18

question.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22
23

I'm sorry.

Thank you, Chief

Justice.
I just wanted to ask you a question

24

about implied reserved water rights.

In the

25

cases where we have dealt with that, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

government has been asked to show in detail the

2

purpose of the reservation and the volume of

3

water that's necessary to achieve that purpose.

4
5
6

Do you have to make any kind of
showing like that here?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in the 1999

7

regulations that Congress allowed to go into

8

effect, the -- the Park Service by rule

9

identified the Park Service units or the areas

10

added or expanded by ANILCA in which there were

11

reserved water rights.

12

the purposes for which these units were

13

established, it's clear that water was a

14

central purpose of them.

15

And when you look at

In fact, the one we have here is the

16

Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, and it

17

-- and it specifically defines as one of the

18

purposes to preserve the entire Charley river

19

basin, including streams and lakes.

20

So that -- that clearly identifies the

21

protection of the integrity of those waters and

22

the -- and the -- the scenic values associated

23

with them.

24

That's why we have this national preserve.

25

That's why we have national parks.

So I -- I think it's clear that water

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

is reserved for the purposes of these

2

reservations, every one of which either refers

3

to specific bodies of water or to aquatic

4

activities, such as fishing or boating or

5

access.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what has been

7

reserved -- what has been reserved here is

8

plenary authority for the federal government -­

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
-- to regulate the

navigable waters?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- the -- the -­

13

the -- the -- the extent of the -- of the -­

14

and -- and the -- the Ninth Circuit's opinion

15

in Katie John III makes this clear, the extent

16

or even, frankly, the existence at a particular

17

location of a reserved water right has not been

18

decided.

19

If -- if there's an adjudication down

20

the road that the reserved water right does not

21

extend to some stretch or another area, that

22

could be resolved.

23

Interior Department had to do in light of the

24

Katie John decisions was to identify the areas

25

that for the time being in its view were

But what the -- what the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

subject to reserved water rights.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, no, I wasn't

3

asking about the geographical limits of it.

4

I'm asking about the regulatory limits.

5

As to water for which there is a

6

reserved right, the federal government, the

7

Park Service can do -- can regulate completely,

8

as it -- is that right?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I wouldn't -- I -­

10

I -- I think within the national park system it

11

overlaps with the 1976 statute that I -- that I

12

mentioned, which I -- I think directly -- you

13

don't have to go through the reserved water

14

rights approach to get there -- within national

15

parks, the -- the -- Katie John's subsistence

16

use could have been satisfied by relying on the

17

1976 Act and not relying on reserved water

18

rights.

19

And all we have here are navigable

20

waters within national parks.

21

the extent of what regulatory power might be

22

triggered would be different.

23
24
25

But, no, I -­

If I could go back to the Chief
Justice's question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, could I just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

slip in one more question since you referred to

2

Katie -- to Katie John, and I'll ask you the

3

same question that was asked of counsel for

4

Alaska.

5

If we were to rule against you here,

6

would that necessarily mean that the Katie John

7

decision was incorrect?

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I would certainly

hope not, but -- but, I mean, I think

10

Petitioners have a different -- Petitioner and

11

the State have a difficult argument because

12

Katie John and the regulations implementing it,

13

once the Congress specifically allowed to go

14

into effect with full acknowledge that Katie

15

John was out there, it turns on the definition

16

of public lands, which is a term that runs

17

throughout the Act, which is, we think, a good

18

reason why -- why it should be upheld.

19

At the very least, Katie John

20

demonstrates the importance of federal

21

regulation of waters within these areas, in

22

that instance for -- for subsistence uses.

23

If I could just finish the answer

24

about sentence 3 of -- of 103 -- 103(c).

25

of the -- one of the things the Park Service

Heritage Reporting Corporation

One

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

could never do is grant access to private

2

lands.

3

things that you can't do in national parks but

4

things that they have to allow, like access,

5

camping, picnicking.

6

The Park Service not only regulates

Well, obviously, the Park Service

cannot allow people to have private -- have

8

access to the private inholdings.

9

the reasons why the Park Service might want to

So one of

10

acquire the adjacent lands or the inholdings

11

would be for the purpose of allowing public

12

access to those areas.

13

But I also want to underscore that

14

there are so many provisions of ANILCA that

15

specifically refer to water and, in fact, the

16

regulation of water.

17

mentioned, 3170(a), specifically allows the

18

Park Service to regulate boating in -- in these

19

areas.

That picks up on the 1976 Act, the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But there's

4

nothing that says that the Park Service has

plenary authority over all the navigable rivers

within the conservation system unit, nor is

7

there any indication by any member of Congress

8

of such a authority?

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

contrary.

I -- I -- I see no indication in

24

that, and this 1410hh-2 that I mentioned

25

specifically says that the waters added to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

these areas are subject to regulation under the

2

Park Service's general authority, which

3

includes the 1976 Act.

4

I think the extraordinary thing would

5

be to say that -- that the federal government

6

through the Park Service did not have the

7

authority to regulate navigable waters, not

8

just any navigable waters but navigable waters

9

in park areas set aside for the very purpose,

10

often express purpose of preserving the values

11

of the rivers and lakes and streams that were

12

in their midst.

13

The -- this -- this -- this is a very

14

water-centric statute.

15

turn it upside down to say that Congress, of

16

all things, was incapable of regulating the

17

navigable waters within -- within the park

18

system.

19

And I think it would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I

20

mean, the waters are very important to Alaskan

21

way of life in the way they aren't elsewhere.

22

And I -- I guess the argument on the other

23

side, it would be pretty extraordinary if you

24

go to the trouble to say you only can regulate

25

lands with respect to which you have title, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

you say from that you get the authority over

2

the rivers, even though title in the submerged

3

lands is in the state?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, our argument

5

doesn't depend on the title question or -- or

6

control over navigable waters.

7

question is involved in -- if -- if -- on the

8

-- on the -- on the Katie John rationale.

9

But, on the points you mentioned,

10

ANILCA itself embodies the compromise or the -­

There's specific provisions for access

normally have in other national parks, but,

provisions for that.

The very things that make Alaska

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But one of the things that -- that is not

2

different about Alaska is the importance of the

3

federal government having control over the

4

navigable waters that are the centerpiece of

5

the parks.

6

What is different about Alaska is the

7

large tracts of inholdings, which is really

what the focus of 103(c) was.

9

situation and only in very limited

And in that

10

circumstances has the Park Service ever applied

11

regulations that go beyond simply the public

12

lands to -- to embrace the broader -- the

13

broader system of -- of -- of lands.

14

And, again, this is the Yukon-Charley

15

River's national monument.

16

17

to conclude that the Park Service, without some

18

express statement to that effect in the -- in

19

the statute, could not regulate it.

20

It would be -- or

It would be extraordinary

And, as I say, this statute giving it

21

the authority to regulate waters is -- is

22

explicit on that point.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T. FINDLEY

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. FINDLEY:

Yes, thank you.

4

Counsel several times cited the

5

provision of ANILCA, saying these parks and

6

preserves shall be governed in accord to the

7

Organic Act.

8

provision of the statute that says "and as

9

amended or modified by ANILCA."

10

Counsel forgot to finish the

So every time they refer to the

11

Organic Act they have to read it together with

12

ANILCA.

13

103(c), at the very front of the statute, it's

14

a linchpin, and it's foundational.

15

it's designed to do is say, if the federal

16

government doesn't have title, it's not public

17

land, it is not part of the park, and it's

18

there to prevent the Park Service from using

19

its Organic Act authority to regulate

20

extraterritorially to land that is not part of

21

the unit.

22

Navigable waters are navigable waters.

We rarely think of them as someone having title

If you

don't have title, does this -- at least with

19

respect to navigable waters, do you have any

20

claim whatsoever?

21

MR. FINDLEY:

What matters here is

that the United States does not have title to

What does 103(c)

And 20 minutes later

The reality is, in their view, any
time they feel it is necessary or appropriate

10

to regulate outside the boundaries of public

11

lands, they feel they can do that.

12

Now they feel, well, we haven't done

13

it that often, but this is exactly what Section

14

103(c) was designed to prevent.

15

looking at 751(b) -- go ahead.

16

thought I heard a question come in.

17

They are
Sorry, I

They are looking at 751(b) and they

18

are relying on that phrase, "activities on or

19

related to water," to justify regulating water

20

that is not part of the unit, and there's no

21

limiting principle to that.

22

Activities on or relating to water

23

could very easily be read as activities taking

24

place on native corporation land within the

25

unit.

All of that is exterritorial regulation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

That is what Section 103(c) was specifically

2

designed to prevent, so every time the Park

3

Service wanted to promulgate a regulation to

4

reach out to non-public land that is not part

5

of the unit, the State of Alaska, a native

6

corporation, or a private party did not have to

7

go petition the court and say:

8

this.

9

Please don't do

That was the central deal of ANILCA.
And the waters were as crucial to that

10

as a native corporation land and the other

11

inholdings.

12

very clear, and for the State of Alaska, the

13

rivers are the roads.

14

constantly references rivers and waters, you

15

need to give effect to both dual balancing that

16

Congress was doing.

17

And while the Act

22

lands.

23

indeed, protects the waters.

wants to restrict access to remote areas of the

different view about access to the remote areas
