ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GEYSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Non-judicial foreclosures are covered

12

under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act as

13

a direct or indirect attempt to collect a

14

consumer's debt.

15

because pre-foreclosure notices are

16

indistinguishable from traditional dunning

17

letters.

18

foreclosure process is designed by law to

19

automatically sell the consumer's house to

20

obtain payment on the consumer's debt.

21

It is a direct attempt

It is an indirect attempt because the

These conclusions follow directly from

22

the Act's plain text, structure, purpose, and

23

history.

24

conclusions by rewriting the statutory text,

25

creating a huge loophole in the Act's scope,

Respondent can only resist these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

and eliminating the safeguards that Congress

2

designed to protect consumers from debt

3

collector mistakes and abuse, which occur all

4

too often in the foreclosure context.

5

We think that the easiest way to

6

resolve this case is to focus directly on the

7

pre-foreclosure notices.

8

quintessential FDCPA communications.

9

so happen to arise in the foreclosure context.

10

They state that there is a default on

Those notices are
They just

11

the debt.

12

owed.

13

And, critically, they state the consequence of

14

failing to satisfy that debt.

15
16
17

They state the amount of the debt

They state to whom the debt is owed.

That message is unequivocal to any
consumer who receives it.
JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you have a --

18

you have a pretty good argument if we look just

19

at 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which talks about

20

regularly collects or attempts to collect,

21

directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or

22

asserted to be owed or due to another.

23

least you've got a -- you've got a reasonable

24

argument under that provision.

25

At

But the two provisions that seem to me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

to create a lot of problems for your position

2

are 15 U.S.A. -- 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which

3

creates a special definition of "debt

4

collector" for a purpose that's not relevant

5

here, and that refers to any business the

6

principal purpose of which is the enforcement

7

of security interests.

8
9

So, if a -- a business whose principal
purpose is the enforcement of security

10

interests fell within the prior definition, the

11

all-purpose definition, there wouldn't be a

12

reason for -- for that provision.

13

think you've got a tough time explaining that

14

away.

15

So I -- I

And your -- your answer is that refers

16

to repo activities.

17

provision that talks about what looks like repo

18

activities in a lot more specific language,

19

1692f(6), which talks about dispossession and

20

disablement.

21

But then there's another

So what's your answer to that?

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

22

think these provisions actually reinforce our

23

reading of the Act.

24

started with the main definition for "debt

25

collector."

What Congress did is it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. GEYSER:

Right.

And then it proceeded and

3

it expanded that definition.

4

the language, it says this term "also

5

includes."

That -- those are words of

6

expansion.

They're collecting people who

7

otherwise don't fall within the main

8

definition.

9

If you look at

So, when we talk about traditional

10

repo activity, we're talking about the type of

11

person who is enforcing a security interest

12

without directly or indirectly --

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

MR. GEYSER:

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

16
17
18
19

But it's --

-- collecting a debt.
-- it's only

expanding it for purposes of 1692f(6).
MR. GEYSER:

Well, exactly, Your

Honor, but -- but our point is that it -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's the -- that

20

means that it's something less than that, other

21

than 1692f(6).

22

natural or a natural way to read it.

23

At least that's the most

MR. GEYSER:

We -- we fully agree.

24

Our point is that for someone who's enforcing a

25

security interest but not also directly or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

indirectly collecting a debt, those people are

2

only subject to that one subsection.

3

And it's very clear what Congress had

4

in mind, precisely because of 1692f(6).

It

5

talks about dispossessing or disabling

6

property.

7

possession of property.

8

demanding payment.

9

selling assets to -- to liquidate someone's

That's talking about taking
It's not talking about

It doesn't talk about

10

debt.

11

kind of activity that Congress would have had

12

in mind if it related to this.

13

It's specifically focused on exactly the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but somebody

14

who's engaging in a non-judicial foreclosure is

15

enforcing a security interest, and if they

16

didn't -- so they appear to fall within that

17

provision.

18

fall within that provision and only wanted to

19

capture the repo guys, why wouldn't it use the

20

more specific language that it used elsewhere

21

when it was referring to the repo guys?

22

And if Congress didn't want them to

MR. GEYSER:

I think if Congress

23

wanted to exclude someone who's both enforcing

24

a security interest and collecting a debt, it

25

would have used one of the exclusions that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

follow the definition in 1692a(6).

2

express exclusions.

3

There's six

And if you look to the -- the second

4

sentence of a -- of a(6), it shows exactly how

5

Congress would have modeled that kind of

6

exclusion.

7

instead of ending at f, it would have ended at

8

g.

9

include anyone enforcing a security interest.

10

And then it would have said, notwithstanding

11

that exclusion, it does apply for purposes of

12

this one subsection.

It would have said at the end --

It would have said this term does not

13

That's exactly what Congress did in

14

the middle sentence that's sandwiched between

15

the -- the main definition and the additional

16

one when it wanted to exclude that type of

17

activity.

18

And to be absolutely clear, if you

19

look to the context of the statute, it

20

reinforces our reading.

21

1692i a venue provision.

22

talks about actions to enforce an interest in

23

real property securing a consumer's debt.

24

That's a foreclosure action.

25

way to read that language.

Congress included in
This venue provision

That's the only

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

And Congress described it as a legal

2

action on a debt against a consumer.

3

provision only applies to someone who fits

4

within the definition of a debt collector under

5

the main definition.

6

That

So it doesn't make any sense to read

7

that section -- it doesn't make any sense to

8

read that section as limited to security

9

enforcers when it only applies to people who

10

might enforce security interests, but they're

11

also collecting debts.

12

But, again, we think if you look just

13

to the initial -- the -- the first part of the

14

section, it talks about the main definition of

15

a debt collector.

16

enforcement provision to exclude people who

17

otherwise qualified directly within that main

18

definition, you're setting up these two

19

sentences to conflict with each other.

20

And if you read the security

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Geyser, can -- I

21

-- I may be missing something here, so I -- I'd

22

appreciate your help.

23

As I understand it, you -- you think

24

that first sentence in a(6) is the main one and

25

captures most debt collectors, but, for some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

reason, it doesn't capture the -- the repo man

2

who in the dead of night goes and just grabs my

3

car.

4

right?

And for that, we need the last sentence,

5

MR. GEYSER:

That -- that's right.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.

I'm

7

following you so far, great.

But then, when I

8

go over to f(6), which further illuminates that

9

last sentence and -- and talks about who's

10

covered, it talks about the fellow who takes --

11

now the dead-of-night repo man you're talking

12

about -- or threatens to take a security

13

interest.

14

So there's that fellow, he's not just

15

taking the stuff in the middle of the night;

16

he's -- he's threatening to do it.

17

talking to me.

18

fellow would have been captured by your reading

19

of the first sentence of -- of a(6).

20

rather convoluted and roundabout, but help me

21

out.

22

your thesis?

23

He's

And I would have thought that

So that's

Why -- why doesn't that disprove your --

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

Well, I -- I don't

24

think it disproves it for a few reasons.

25

is that 1692f(6) also applies to people who are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

One

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

debt collectors under the main definition.

2

it's possible that when you're looking at

3

somebody who enforces a security interest

4

without collecting a debt, that those are the

5

people who typically are not communicating with

6

the debtor.

7

So

And there's certainly a large portion

8

of repo activity or people who are changing

9

locks on doors who want nothing to do with the

10

debtor at all.

11

The entire point is to show up in the dead of

12

night, take their car, and return it to the

13

creditor.

14

They hope to never see them.

Now I think what's critical about f(6)

15

is, again, it does not talk about demanding

16

payment; it doesn't talk about liquidating

17

assets.

18

activity it's covering, it's not covering

19

people who fall within the main definition.

20

And so, if you think of the type of

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Many elegant words

21

there, but what do we do about the word

22

"threatening"?

23

That was my question.

MR. GEYSER:

Yeah.

Well, again, two

24

-- two -- two ways to handle it.

One is that

25

they may not be threatening to collect a debt.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

They may not be demanding payment.

2

not be liquidating the asset.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

They may

The other is --

Well, threaten to

4

take a non-judicial action to -- with respect

5

to a security interest.

6

statute says.

That's what the

7

MR. GEYSER:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9
10
11

with that language.

Well, it -So -- so help me out

That's where I need your

-- I know you've got something for me here.
MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

Well, it could be

12

that they threatened to take the car when, in

13

fact, they don't intend to take it at that --

14

at that time, because they want to get paid.

15

They want to tow the car back to the creditor

16

and they're hoping to keep it there so they can

17

take it in time.

18

But, again, I think the most common

19

application of the security enforcer definition

20

will typically involve people who aren't

21

communicating with the debtor.

22

f(6) also applies to someone who qualifies

23

under the main definition.

24

security enforcers and to people who are

25

full-fledged debt collectors.

And remember

It applies to both

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

And so Congress --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the point.

3

That's the point, I think.

I mean, let's call

4

it part 1 and part 2.

5

collectors can't -- are so and so, and then

6

here are all the things they can't do.

7

that's a lot of them.

Part 1 says debt

And

8

And then we have part 2, and part 2

9

says the mortgage people are debt collectors

10

for purposes of f(6).

11

all of them.

12

ones.

13
14

And f(6) doesn't have

It just has a few pretty bad

And so why would Congress have put in
f(6) if it wanted all of them to apply?

15

MR. GEYSER:

Well, again, Your Honor,

16

it put in f(6) to reach the group of people who

17

are not also full-fledged debt collectors, who

18

are not also obtaining a transfer of debt.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it doesn't say

20

that.

21

they put in part 2, which I'm calling part 2,

22

to be sure that these people who are not

23

full-fledged debt collectors have to do at

24

least f(6).

25

It says a debt collector may not -- or

Okay?

MR. GEYSER:

Absolutely.

But, again,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

I --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

And if we

3

have a person who fits within the definition of

4

part 2, that would seem to argue against his

5

fitting into the definition of part 1.

6
7

MR. GEYSER:

Well, absolutely not,

Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. GEYSER:

No?

Because you can have

10

someone who does both.

Take -- take a repo man

11

who shows up, but instead of doing what -- what

12

they actually do, which is they wait for the

13

consumer to leave and then they take their car

14

--

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. GEYSER:

Yeah.

-- they actually go to

17

the consumer and they say:

18

going to give you three hours to pay the debt.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You know what, I'm

And why isn't the

20

repo man like that in part 1?

21

MR. GEYSER:

22
23
24
25

He is.

And so that's

exactly right.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Then who is in part 2

but not in part 1?
MR. GEYSER:

The people in part 2 are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

the -- it's sort of like a Venn diagram.

2

are some people who collect debts without

3

enforcing a security interest.

4

people who enforce security interests without

5

collecting debts.

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are some

Isn't the repo man

doing that?

8
9

There

MR. GEYSER:
point.

Exactly.

That's our

And then there's the middle category,

10

like the foreclosure agents, who are doing

11

both, because they're sending notices that are

12

absolutely indistinguishable from classic debt

13

collection activity.

14

They're demanding payment on the debt.

15

And if you don't pay -- and, by the way, in

16

Colorado, in 2017, about 11 percent of people

17

did, in fact, pay in response to these notices.

18

They worked pretty well.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But that's my

20

other question, of course, is what do you want

21

to say in respect to the fact that Colorado has

22

a pretty good, in many respects stricter law

23

than there is here, and -- and that protects

24

the consumers more, and yet I guess, if we

25

accept what you say, we'd have to say that that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

Colorado law is illegal.

2
3

MR. GEYSER:

Absolutely not, Your

Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. GEYSER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

No?

Because?

Well -I mean, the reason I

7

thought it would be illegal is because it says

8

you can't communicate with a third person.

9

couldn't tell the trustee about he's supposed

You

10

to send a letter.

You couldn't communicate,

11

put anything in the newspaper.

12

would seem to me contradictory, and I guess the

13

Colorado law would fall then.

14

MR. GEYSER:

I mean, that

Your Honor, out of -- out

15

of all the eight amicus briefs, and incredibly

16

able counsel for Respondent and the government,

17

they could cobble together, at best, three or

18

maybe four possible conflicts.

19

And when you actually dig into the

20

weeds of those conflicts, they're not conflicts

21

at all.

22

if you want to walk through them, if you look

23

at the notice on 1692g, that says that if the

24

--

25

They're very easy to accommodate.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't have to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

walk through them if you don't want to.

2

tell me where they are in your brief.

3

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

Just

Well, they're --

4

they're addressed at the end of our brief.

5

They're also addressed in the amicus brief.

6

But I think the -- I'll make a couple critical

7

points, though, because I think -- I think one

8

that is the easiest way to resolve those

9

conflicts.

10

You can first obtain advance consent

11

from the consumer to provide all necessary

12

consents in the event of a foreclosure.

13

And if the consumer decides not to

14

follow through, the creditor can send the

15

notice.

16

We know this from Henson.

17

professional debt collectors.

18

absolutely nothing in the Colorado scheme that

19

says that a foreclosure has to be run by a

20

professional debt collector.

21

The FDCPA does not apply to creditors.
It only applies to
And there is

The consumer can -- the creditor can

22

take the notice, publish it themselves, and

23

there is absolutely no problem.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Geyser, I -- I

find this a difficult question.

Going back to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

something that Justice Alito said, the reason I

2

find it a difficult question is it seems to me

3

that judicial foreclosures, non-judicial

4

foreclosures, fall within both.

5

They -- you know, these people are

6

debt collectors under the language of the

7

statute, and these people are enforcing

8

security interests under the language of the

9

statute.

10

But that can't be right because the

11

grammar of the statute suggests that we now

12

have to kick them out of one or the other.

13

right?

14

All

And so the question is, which do we

15

kick them out of?

16

that they look like debt collectors, we're not

17

going to treat them like debt collectors, or do

18

we say that, notwithstanding that they enforce

19

security interests, we're going to pretend that

20

they don't?

21

Do we say, notwithstanding

So, when I think about it that way, I

22

kind of think:

Well, I don't know,

23

foreclosures are paradigmatic enforcement of

24

security interests.

25

more enforcing a security interest than

There's nothing that gets

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

foreclosing on a mortgage.

2

So kicking them out of that one seems

3

a little bit more odd than kicking them out of

4

a very broad definition of debt collectors.

5

MR. GEYSER:

Well, a few points, Your

6

Honor.

First is I don't think you have to kick

7

them out of the additional definition if they

8

fall in the main definition.

9

said, if phrased as an exclusion, instead of an

If Congress had

10

addition, they're trying to capture more

11

people, then I think that that point would have

12

more force.

13

Even if Congress had said for purposes

14

of subsection 1692f(6) only, but they didn't

15

say that, and, again, this is a -- this is a

16

definitional section that's capturing people.

17

You start at the beginning.

You're

18

seeing, is this person covered?

19

fall within any clause, they're not covered.

20

If they don't

And so, if you fall within the first

21

clause, you're covered.

If you happen to also

Well, let me ask you

12

this about the repo situation:

13

the repo guy is out there getting into a car,

14

and the owner of the car sees him out the

15

window and runs out with a gun and says, what

16

are you doing?

17

you didn't pay, you're in default on your

18

payments, so I'm taking your car.

19

Suppose that

And the repo guy says, well,

Is he a -- is he a debt collector

20

because he's now told the -- the -- the car

21

owner that -- about the debt?

22

MR. GEYSER:

In -- in that scenario, I

23

don't think so because he's not leveraging the

24

security interest.

25

said, if you want to pay now, I'll get out of

It would be different if he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the car and go away.

2

But if he says, look, you've -- you've

3

run out of chances.

You didn't pay your bill.

4

I'm towing the car.

Take it up with the

5

creditor.

6

at that point, the repo man brings the car back

7

to the creditor.

8
9

And to be very clear, what happens

At that point, the -- the debtor still
owes 100 percent of the same debt they owed

10

before the repossession.

It's the creditor

11

then who takes the car, sends the notice under

12

the UCC, and says, if you want your car back,

13

pay us the money, or we'll auction off the car

14

and pay down your debt.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what is the

16

difference between that situation and the

17

non-judicial foreclosure situation where the --

18

the homeowner is simply notified that the --

19

the house that -- the mortgage is being

20

foreclosed?

21
22

24
25

MR. GEYSER:

I -- I think -- I think

there's a stark difference, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the

difference?
MR. GEYSER:

Well, the difference is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

that they're not just saying we're going to

2

foreclose on your house no matter what you do.

3

They're saying this is the amount you owe.

This is the consequence if you don't pay it by

this date.

We've been instructed to take away

Adding an express statement at the end

of that that says will you please pay now is

person who receives that letter.

what, that's -- that's leagues away because

they're not leveraging the security interest.

20

But someone who just says that

And, again, if you look to the -- the

21

structure of the Act, it's very hard to

22

understand how foreclosure activity does not

because you're focusing specifically on what

But the result of that

10

is to liquidate the debt.

11

your principal argument as to non-judicial

foreclosures was that we should look to the

13

real economic effect of this, which is to

14

liquidate the debt.

15

And I thought that

And just like a non-judicial

16

foreclosure liquidates a debt, so too does

17

repossession of the collateral do the exact

18

same thing.

19

MR. GEYSER:

The -- it eventually

20

might, Justice Kagan, but it doesn't when the

21

repo man's job is over.

When the repo man brings the car back to the

It seems as though,

when you get to the repo man, you're indulging

in all these sort of hypertechnical

distinctions, the same kind that you criticize

non-judicial foreclosures.

8

non-technical about it, you should carry

through the non-technical, and then the repo

distinction between repo and non-judicial

3

about this:

4

was there was debate about whether those who

5

enforce security interests would be covered

6

under debt collection or -- debt collector or

7

not.

8

no.

9

something in between.

But correct me if I'm wrong
The history of how this came about

There were two polar positions, yes and

10

And what Congress ended up with was

MR. GEYSER:

Is that correct?
Well, it is correct, but

11

I -- I would draw a different inference from

12

that.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And the something

14

in between, though, it's hard to just read that

15

in between language as repo and not

16

non-judicial foreclosure.

17

MR. GEYSER:

Not at all, Your Honor.

18

I think that's exactly what Congress had in

19

mind.

20
21
22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's the heart

of it for me.
MR. GEYSER:

Well, let -- let me try

23

to convince you then, because I think what

24

Congress did is -- the competing bill said

25

either security enforcers weren't included at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

all or it said they're included for everything.

2

So a repo man also has to -- even though

3

they're not communicating with people normally,

4

they have to state the correct amount of the

5

debt and do everything else that the FDCPA

6

requires.

7

Now the compromise that Congress

8

struck is they recognized some people will

9

enforce security interests without also

10

collecting debts, and so they subjected them to

11

a single subsection that describes that

12

activity.

13

I think it's quite telling that f(6)

14

does not talk about demanding payment.

15

doesn't talk about selling assets.

16

very different if you look to the type of

17

regulations that apply in the foreclosure

18

setting.

19

And this is really key.

It

And that is

When you have

20

someone who is threatening to sell someone's

21

house, and they're stating the wrong amount

22

that's owed or they're tacking on unauthorized

23

charges, they make it very difficult for the

24

homeowner to cure the debt, and they can make

25

it very difficult to actually pay the amount

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1
2

they're owed.
All the other substantive provisions

3

apply to someone who's engaged in the

4

foreclosure setting because they're actually

5

sending letters that are leveraging the

6

security interests to try to collect.

7

they fail to collect, they're selling the house

8

to obtain payment on the debt.

11

And if

And the guy with the tow truck is not
selling the car.

Again, what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me, I --

12

I've been having a huge problem with this

13

entire case, not on your position, but I was

14

going to ask this of your adversary.

I'm

15

reading the language of the statute.

It says,

16

for the purposes of Section 1692f, it includes

17

people who are enforcing.

18

And the statement that 1692f starts

19

with is "a debt collector, period, may not use

20

the unfair or unconscionable means to collect

21

or attempt to collect any debt."

22

say that a security person is a debt collector.

23

It seems to

And it says, "without limiting the

24

general applicability of the foregoing, without

25

limiting that people who enforce debts,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

security interests, the following conduct in

2

addition is a violation of this section".

3

I don't mean to help you, but I --

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but I'm reading

6

f and it seems clearly to support your

7

position.

8

additional bad ways that they can violate being

9

a debt collector.

10

It's basically saying these are two

It's not limiting it to

those two ways.

11

MR. GEYSER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

I don't even know

what the repo argument was about in your brief.

14
15

Your Honor, I --

MR. GEYSER:

Well, the repo argument

in our brief -- and, Your Honor, just to be --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's adding --

17

it's also including -- if there was ever any

18

doubt, it's also including those people.

19

MR. GEYSER:

It -- it is, Your Honor,

20

but just to be candid, though, it is also

21

including them only for the one subsection of

22

1692.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the one

24

subsection seems to say any of these people

25

can't do unfair practices.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

MR. GEYSER:

Exactly.

And so -- but

2

the reason that we brought up the repo example

3

in our brief is to show that there -- there is

4

an entire industry that clearly qualifies under

5

the additional definition, without directly --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. GEYSER:

8

That -- that --

-- or indirectly

collecting debts.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that's fine,

10

but what -- what's really -- what's really at

11

issue is the unfair practices.

12

who enforce security interests cannot collect

13

or attempt to collect any debt unfairly.

14

That's the first sentence.

15

These people

And without limiting that general

16

sentence, these two additional things are

17

considered unfair practices.

18

MR. GEYSER:

19

correct, Your Honor.

20
21
22

I -- I think that's

And if I could reserve the balance of
my time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

tell me the counter.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why -- why are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

they arguing that other unfair practices are

2

not actionable when that sentence says it is to

3

my mind?

4

MR. GEYSER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah.

Well -What am I missing

there?

7

MR. GEYSER:

Well, yeah, I -- I don't

8

think you're -- you're missing anything.

I

9

think the easiest way to read the statute is to

10

start at the beginning and to see that if you

11

qualify under the main definition, there's

12

nothing that excludes you from the Act.

13

And the fact that Congress used clear

14

words of inclusion to capture certain people

15

who don't fit within the main definition, it

16

doesn't justify excluding those people from

17

that first sentence.

constitute the impermissible act of debt

collection is the notice of election and

25

that, under Colorado law, is required to

That is the notice

2

Now, to be sure, that notice requires

3

disclosure of the amount, the principal amount,

4

that is owed on the mortgage, and it also

5

requires disclosure of the identity of the

6

holder of the note.

7

not a notice that is even directed at the

8

consumer.

9

But, beyond that, that is

Now, to be sure, there are in the

10

record in this case other documents that were

11

sent to the consumer, but even with regard to

12

those documents, those documents as well either

13

initiate the process or are incidental to the

14

initiation of the process, and, critically,

15

they contain no demand for payment.

16

And the very fact of the initiation of

17

a foreclosure process is that it ordinarily

18

represents a decision on the part of the

19

creditor to stop seeking payment and instead to

20

pursue an alternative remedy.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but in

22

most cases -- well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm just

23

assuming in most cases that if you start the

24

foreclosure process, and the debtor comes in

25

and says, okay, I see you're serious about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

this, and, you know, either rearranges the

2

financing or pays the debt, that's the purpose,

3

right?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Banks don't

6

want to own houses.

7

the reason they go to foreclosure is to get

8

payment of the debt.

9

They want to be paid.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And

From the perspective

10

of a creditor, Mr. Chief Justice, it is

11

certainly true, and it also happens to accord

12

with common sense that the creditor would like

13

to be made whole.

14

There are, of course, two means by

15

which a creditor can be made whole.

16

is to obtain payment from the debtor; and the

17

second is the alternative, the last resort, to

18

enforce a security interest.

19

The first

Now, if we were dealing with the first

20

sentence of the definition in isolation, I

21

would certainly be confident making the

22

argument that this is not debt collection in

23

the abstract because what is taking place here

24

is not an effort to obtain or demand payment

25

from the debtor, consistent with the ordinary

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

meaning of these terms.

2

It is, at most, an effort to initiate

3

a process that could lead to the elimination or

4

reduction of the debt, and not everything that

5

could lead to the elimination of a debt

6

constitutes debt collection.

7

the --

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, of course,

Well, I don't really

understand that, Mr. Shanmugam.

I mean, the

10

whole point of getting the security interest in

11

the first place is so that the creditor has

12

leverage in order to pressure the debtor to pay

13

his debt.

14

And -- and it's an alternative way to

15

collect the debt if the debtor fails to do so.

16

So how can it not be about payment of the debt?

17
18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, let me pick up

on that formulation, Justice Kagan.

19

I think it would be a different case

20

if what was going on was that a creditor was

21

using the threat of foreclosure to exact

22

payment.

23

In other words, if a creditor came in

24

and said, if you don't pay your overdue payment

25

by Friday, I'm going to initiate non-judicial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39

underscore that we're not looking for some sort

of categorical exclusion.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

A party initiating

Well, whether you say

7

that or not explicitly, isn't that how

8

everybody understands a foreclosure notice?

9

They're going to foreclose on my house unless I

10
11

come up with my -- some money.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that everyone

12

would certainly understand that that is the

13

consequence of a foreclosure proceeding.

14

think my submission is a more modest one.

15

And, again, of course, we're not

I

16

considering this issue in the abstract because

17

we have the limited purpose definition, but if

18

we were considering this issue in the abstract,

19

my point would simply be that not everything

20

that might, for instance, increase someone's

21

incentive to pay constitutes debt collection.

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, that's true,

23

but it's inherently communicating a message

24

that you need to repay the debt or you're going

25

to lose the house, as Justice Kagan says.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You -- you referred earlier to common

effort to have you repay the debt.

4

Well, common sense tells you this is an

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't think

5

that that's true, and let me offer a sort of

6

slightly modified --

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Why not?

Why not?

Well -Even if the

10

express words aren't there, everyone who gets

11

something like that, who has the money, and

12

wants to, will understand this is a -- this is

13

a letter seeking to get you to repay.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think the common

15

sense is that anyone who receives that letter

16

would certainly have the incentive to pay if

17

they could, because, of course, no one wants to

18

lose their house.

19

Again, I think my submission is a more

20

modest one.

And if you take a look at the case

21

law, there is actually a well developed body of

22

case law in the lower courts, not surprisingly,

23

on the question of what constitutes debt

24

collection outside the foreclosure context,

25

because you might imagine this issue has arisen

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

quite frequently in the four decades since the

2

enactment of the Act.

3

Those cases focus on whether, as an

4

objective matter, there is an intent to induce

5

payment.

6

main at two factors:

7

there is a demand for payment, and, second,

8

they look at the purpose and the context of the

9

communication, the animating purpose.

And those cases have looked in the
first, whether or not

10

And here --

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Exactly.

The

12

animating purpose is to tell you you need to

13

pay or you're going to lose your house.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The animating purpose

15

is to initiate the non-judicial foreclosure

16

process.

20

That is why the bank at issue here

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
really?

Is it an either/or

I mean, it can't be a both/and?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that

21

leads me to the point about the limited purpose

22

definition, which you picked up on earlier in

23

your colloquy with Mr. Geyser.

24

that if we know one thing from the history of

25

the Act, it is that Congress thought that the

And that is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

collection of debts and the enforcement of

2

security interests were distinct concepts.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what do you --

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And we know that not

5

just because of the language of the limited

6

purpose definition but because Congress really

7

struggled with the question of whether to bring

8

in entities whose principal purpose was the

9

enforcement of security interests for all

10

purposes, whether to exclude them entirely, or

11

instead to bring them in only for purposes of a

12

single provision --

13
14
15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

have -MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- which wouldn't have

made sense.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

the word "indirectly" in the first part.

19

even if you think in a technical sense

20

initiating foreclosure is not collecting the

21

debt, it certainly is an indirect effort to

22

collect the debt.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You do have
And

Well, I think that

24

that makes it somewhat harder for me.

25

again, if we were arguing this case with a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And,

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

statute that just contained the first sentence,

2

I would argue that indirect debt collection

3

refers, as the lower courts have held, to

4

situations in which you engage in preliminary

5

steps that facilitate the ultimate demand for

6

payment, for instance, collecting information

7

about the debtor.

8

But, again, what we know from the text

9

and from the history is that Congress, whatever

10

debt collection would mean in a platonic form,

11

Congress thought about debt collection in the

12

way that we think about it and in a way that is

13

consistent, of course, with the traditional

14

understanding at common law.

15

As we explain in our brief, debt

collection and enforcement of security

interests have, of course, been distinct

remedies.

19

action, the latter an in rem action.

20

The former was an in personam

There are numerous places in federal

21

law where the two are treated as distinct.

22

so Congress, when it used the phrase

23

"enforcement of security interests," was

24

certainly not writing on a blank slate.

25

meant to capture --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
44

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

3

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But you're --

-- that body of law.
You are arguing, I

4

think, that even if I disagree with you, we

5

disagree with you on the first sentence, you

6

win because of the third sentence, right?

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

8

I think all -- I think I need --

9

Yes, that is correct.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And on the third

10

sentence, I guess the -- the responsive

11

argument is that's an odd way for Congress to

12

have excluded those who enforce security

13

interests from the broad definition of debt

14

collectors and the repo example you heard.

15

you respond to that?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

Can

So, first of

17

all, let me talk about the limited purpose

18

definition and then I'll talk about f(6), the

19

substantive provision that it incorporates.

20

With regard to the limited purpose

21

definition, I think that this is exactly the

22

way that you would expect Congress to have

23

reached the Goldilocks outcome where parties

24

who enforce a security interest are subject

25

only to one substantive provision.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

Let me give you an example.

2

that Congress passed a statute that said that

3

the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to

4

review decisions of federal courts of appeals,

5

and for purposes of reviewing capital cases,

6

the Supreme Court also has jurisdiction to

7

review decisions of the Court of Appeals for

8

the Armed Forces.

9

Let's say

I think that the natural inference

10

from that would be that, if you have a

11

non-capital case from the CAAF, this Court

12

would lack jurisdiction.

13

And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

14

that's not the most natural reading.

15

it's -- the "also includes," you would normally

16

say that it doesn't include; rather, the "also

17

include" is additive, and it's additive to a

18

pretty broad collection as well.

19

It's --

You would say even though, again,

20

arguendo, this would be included in the broad

21

language, it doesn't include this.

22

instead, it says it also includes this, and

23

then for the limited purpose.

24
25

But,

It's -- it's not the way you would
have told Congress to write this statute, or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

your -- or your friend on the other side.

2

a very circuitous way of getting to your

3

result.

4
5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's

Congress never asked

me how to write statutes, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think what I

8

would say in response to that is the fact that

9

it's additive helps us because it reinforces

10

the sense that Congress thought that the

11

collection of debts was distinct from the

12

enforcement of security interests.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but now you're

14

-- you're counting on your argument about

15

sentence one again.

16

questions are really questions that assume that

17

you're wrong on sentence one.

18

And I think that these

Assume that these are debt collectors

19

under the definition that Congress has gave.

20

And the question is why we should then read an

21

additive provision to exclude people from that

22

general definition.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I think, first, I

24

would say that -- I don't think that you could

25

say that debt collection is unambiguously so

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

expansive as to cover this situation.

2
3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I want

to make you assume that.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But if you think --

5

but if you do presume that for purposes of this

6

question, I think what I would say is that

7

Congress still viewed enforcement of security

8

interests as distinct.

9

would say with regard to the fallback

And what you -- what I

10

definition is that it can't be narrowed to this

11

almost impossibly small category of security

12

interest enforcers to which my friend, Mr.

13

Geyser, refers.

14

First, I don't think he disputes the

15

proposition that what we were doing in this

16

case was the enforcement of a security

17

interest.

18

takes a narrower view of the meaning of that

19

well-established concept.

20

In other words, I don't think he

Instead, his view, as I understand it,

21

is that, to take his Venn diagram, there is at

22

least some sliver of security interest

23

enforcers who would be -- who would not be

24

covered by his expansive definition of debt

25

collector but who would nevertheless fall

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

within the limited purpose definition.

2

these are these repo agents who are

3

non-communicative.

4

And

It's not even the entire category of

5

repo agents.

6

in the dead of night.

7

It's the person who takes the car

And I think what I would say in

8

response to that is that that doesn't solve his

9

profound superfluity problem because I think

10

that, under his definition of "debt collector,"

11

even the uncommunicative repo agent would still

12

qualify.

13

Certainly, when your car is

14

repossessed, that creates every bit as much of

15

an incentive to pay as receiving a notice that

16

there might eventually be a foreclosure sale of

17

your house.

18

it also potentially could lead in much the same

19

way to the creditor being made whole.

20

And I think what is more, I think

And so I think one thing about

21

Petitioner's submission here is that Petitioner

22

doesn't offer some alternative definition for

23

"debt collection".

24

really is that anything that creates an

25

incentive to pay would qualify.

I think that their position

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

And I would respectfully submit that

2

that goes further than the well-established

3

body of case law to which I referred on the

4

subject of what constitutes debt collection.

5

And it would also sweep in a range of innocuous

6

communications, as we explain in our brief.

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

On the third

8

sentence, I think what you're saying, but tell

9

me if I'm wrong, is that even if we disagree

10

with you on the first sentence, a necessary

11

premise of the third sentence is that Congress,

12

notwithstanding the broad language of the first

13

sentence, must have thought that enforcement of

14

security interests should be distinct from debt

15

collection?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that's right.

17

And let me point to one more textual cue that

18

hopefully will be helpful to the Court in that

19

regard.

20

When the -- when Congress is talking

21

about this issue in 1692a(6), it's talking

22

about it in terms of the definition of "debt

23

collector."

24

order to be liable under the provision at issue

25

here and really most of the provisions in the

And as we explain in our brief, in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

Act, you have to both be a debt collector and

2

engaged in debt collection.

3

And I think, in this definition of

4

"debt collector," Congress sets up a

5

contradistinction between, on the one hand, an

6

entity whose principal purpose, and it has to

7

be the principal purpose, is the collection of

8

debts, and an entity whose principal purpose,

9

again, the principal purpose, is the

10

enforcement of security interests.

11

And, again, that's another textual cue

12

that suggests that this is an either/or

13

proposition, that Congress thought -- again,

14

whatever the meaning of "debt collection" in

15

the abstract -- that these were distinct

16

concepts.

17

After all, if you take a look at the

18

earlier bills, which we quote, I think, at page

19

25 of our brief, Congress uses that distinction

20

throughout all of these bills.

21

thinking about bringing in entities whose

22

principal purpose is debt collection or the

23

enforcement of security interests into the full

24

ambit of the Act.

25

Congress is

Now let me say just a word about f(6)

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

because I promised I was going to say something

2

about that.

3

that is incorporated and that applies to these

4

limited purpose security interest enforcers.

5

That is the substantive provision

I think it's frankly a little bit

6

unclear what that provision reaches exactly,

7

and I think it's frankly a little bit unclear

8

whether that provision reaches foreclosure

9

proceedings.

I think that there is a pretty

10

good argument that it does in a fairly limited

11

way.

12

to the foreclosure proceedings at issue here.

13

But, if that provision were somehow,

And no one's arguing that it would apply

14

again, read to apply only to the

15

uncommunicative repo agent, which, again, I

16

thought was Mr. Geyser's submission, then you

17

would have expected Congress to have used

18

narrower language in the limited purpose

19

definition as well.

20

Congress referred generically to the

21

enforcement of security interests.

22

But, instead, again,

And, Justice Sotomayor, in response to

23

the concern that you raised at the end of

24

Mr. Geyser's argument, I think what I would say

25

is first that, again, the limited purpose

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

definition refers specifically to f(6).

2

the extent that that prefatory language speaks

3

about debt collection, I think that just

4

reflects the reality that f(6) applies not just

5

to entities that are subject to the limited

6

purpose definition but also, of course, to debt

7

collectors who qualify under the broader

8

definition.

9

And to

I think the other statutory provision

10

that I would just say a word about is the venue

11

provision because that's the provision that

12

Mr. Geyser cited during his argument.

13

regard to that provision, I think we would

14

recognize that that provision establishes a

15

federal venue for at least certain judicial

16

foreclosure actions.

17

And with

We certainly don't dispute that

18

subsection (1) of that provision applies to

19

judicial foreclosure.

20

note in our brief, judicial foreclosures are

21

different from non-judicial foreclosures.

22

case only presents a question concerning

23

non-judicial foreclosures.

24
25

But, of course, as we

This

One of the characteristic features of
a judicial foreclosure is the ability to seek a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

deficiency judgment.

2

deficiency judgment in the context of a

3

judicial foreclosure proceeding, we would

4

concede that it is essentially demanding

5

payment and therefore would qualify as a debt

6

collector, just as a party initiating a

7

non-judicial foreclosure would if they, in

8

fact, accompanied that with a demand for

9

payment.

10

And where a party seeks a

And that just underscores the fact

11

that all we're asking this Court to do is

12

essentially to say that the general test for

13

debt collection would apply in this context

14

such that if there were a demand for payment,

15

there would be debt collection and the

16

provisions of the Act would apply.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is a bit

18

strange to think that Congress intended to

19

cover judicial foreclosures where a judge is

20

supervising the process but not when it's a

21

non-judge supervised process.

22

counterintuitive, where more --

It's -- it's

MR. SHANMUGAM:

2

protect or review what's occurring.

3

I'm not sure.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It -- I --

Well, I -You seem to argue

6

that because Congress knew that non-judicial

7

foreclosures were set forth in very particular

8

ways.

9

are.

But they also knew judicial foreclosures

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think, Justice

11

Sotomayor, that what I would say about that is

12

that it wasn't so much that Congress was

13

seeking to cover judicial foreclosures as that

14

it was seeking to cover situations in which

15

you're seeking payment.

16

And a judicial foreclosure, as you

17

will be well aware, is more like a typical

18

lawsuit where a party is effectively bringing

19

an in personam action, as is ordinarily the

20

case or at least often the case, against the

21

debtor and, in the context of that, seeking

22

payment.

That's really no different from --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that --

24

that's the problem with non-judicial

25

foreclosure.

There's no way to ignore that you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55

take the property to sell it to pay off a part

2

or the whole of the debt.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And I certainly am not

4

here to dispute that reality.

5

say two things about non-judicial foreclosures

6

in my short time left.

7

I think I would

The first is that even non-judicial

8

foreclosures provide considerable protections

9

to debtors and I think --

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So do foreclosure

actions.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is -- that

13

is correct, but I -- I do think that

14

non-judicial foreclosures -- and -- and

15

Colorado's scheme is distinct in some ways but

16

characteristic in others -- do require notice

17

to be provided to debtors.

18

They do often provide at least some

19

judicial mechanism for, for instance, a

20

determination of whether or not a party is in

21

default or a review after a sale.

22

certainly opportunities to void sales.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And there's

It doesn't help

you review after sales if you've lost your

home.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

ability actually to unwind the sale where there

is -- there is fraud or misrepresentations or

4

other misconduct.

5

me to the other point that I wanted to spend at

suggested that you should look at his briefs,

13

if you take a look at the relevant section of

14

his reply brief, pages 20 to 21, he doesn't

15

deny any of the specific conflicts, the

16

conflicts between the notice provisions and the

17

limitations on communications, the fact that

Colorado law provides a mechanism for

verification, whereas, in fact, the FDCPA

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN C. BOND

15

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

17
18

MR. BOND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

19

In the FDCPA, Congress made a

20

considered compromise judgment between security

21

interest enforcers as debt collectors for a

22

single subsection of the Act, and not for the

23

remainder, including the provisions at issue

24

here.

25

Petitioner's contrary position would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

nullify that congressional judgment by

2

extending all of the Act's provisions to all

3

security interest enforcers, and his answer to

4

that is this increasingly narrowed category

5

that seems reverse-engineered to pick up only a

6

subset of repossession agents, which he says

7

saves the provision from superfluity.

8

argument fails for two fundamental reasons.

9

That

First and foremost, it's not what the

10

statute says, and it's a highly unnatural way

11

to read the text if that's what Congress is

12

trying to do.

13

Congress used a well-understood,

14

familiar term, "enforcement of security

15

interests," which I think Petitioner concedes

16

in his reply brief and this morning that that

17

text does not naturally track this subset of

18

repossession agents.

19

really trying to do what Petitioner suggests,

20

of just tacking on this small sliver of

21

repossession agents, it's a highly unnatural

22

way to go about it.

23

So, if Congress were

If instead, as we submit, Congress was

24

trying to preserve the existing distinction

25

between enforcing security interests and debt

collection and the practical difference between

2

those two -- because, when you enforce a

3

security interest, you're not asking the debtor

4

to do anything -- if Congress was trying to

5

treat those two things separately, you would

6

expect it to write a statute along these lines.

7

The first --

8

10
11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Not really.

I

mean, this is a pretty unnatural way to do that
too.
MR. BOND:

So the language undoubtedly

12

could be clearer, but what's -- I think what

13

comes from the text is that Congress referred

14

to enforcement of security interests as a

15

distinct concept.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just so I

17

understand the nature of your argument, I mean,

18

you could be saying, look, foreclosure

19

proceedings don't fall within the general

20

purpose definition.

21

limited purpose definition.

22

They only fall within the

Or you could be saying, oh, gosh, we

23

have a funny statute here, they fit within

24

both, and now we have to figure out what to

25

make of that.

So which argument are you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

making?

2

MR. BOND:

So I think the argument

3

that we're making is that Congress chose to

4

treat these two things separately.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but you're not

6

answering my question.

7

the general purpose provision itself, do you --

8

only, that's the only thing that the statute

9

says -- would foreclosure proceedings fit or

10
11

Take just if you have

not?
MR. BOND:

I think that's a -- it's a

12

very difficult question because you wouldn't

13

have text that speaks directly to it.

14

you would look at with just that definition is

15

the context, including the historical

16

definition -- or the historical distinction and

17

the practical difference between them.

18

And what

So the question you would ask is, when

19

Congress used the phrase "debt collection or

20

collection of any debt," did it mean to

21

preserve that distinction or sweep it aside and

22

bring in all of Article 9 of the UCC and state

23

foreclosure law.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It -- it -- it

didn't use that language, though, and it -- it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

seems significant language on the first step of

2

Justice Kagan's question.

3

It said indirectly.

And when you're

4

talking about collecting a debt indirectly,

5

well, what are other examples of collecting the

6

debt indirectly that would be better examples

7

than foreclosing on the -- on the mortgage?

8

MR. BOND:

So I think fore -- indirect

9

debt collection would encompass things like

10

publishing notice that's not directed to the

11

debtor but intended to shame the debtor into

12

paying or trying to garnish his wages

13

informally by going to the employer.

14

There are other things in that

15

category.

But, at the end of the day, we're

16

not here to argue about which reading of that

17

first sentence is better.

18

has a plausible reading of that first sentence.

19

But, at the end of the day, the second

We think each side

20

sentence tells you how Congress viewed these.

21

And it chose to regulate security interest

22

enforcers separately.

23

And I think the second fundamental

24

problem with using repo to save this from

25

superfluity is that it doesn't actually do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

that.

2

As Mr. Shanmugam was explaining and

3

some of the questions pointed out, repossession

4

or even this narrowed subset of repossession

5

would constitute debt collection under

6

Petitioner's own broad reading of that indirect

7

clause.

8

take property to satisfy a debt.

9

take someone's property --

The whole point of repossession is to

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And when you

I'm sorry, he --

11

he doesn't, because he says the creditor

12

doesn't care -- the repo man doesn't care about

13

the debt.

14

He gets paid for taking the car.
And if the creditor gets the car, the

15

creditor exempted -- is exempted from the Act

16

because he can -- he's legally entitled for his

17

debt not covered by the Act to sell it.

18

MR. BOND:

I think it --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so I'm not

20

sure how you're right.

The repo man is not

21

looking for the guy to sell.

22

Mr. Shanmugam said that if the repo guy said I

23

will wait to three hours, if you pay your debt,

24

I won't take your car, that he could, in fact,

25

be a debt collector.

And I think even

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

MR. BOND:

So we agree on the last

2

point.

We agree that if you engage in security

3

interest enforcement but then go further and

4

make threats or demand payment, then that's

5

debt collection.

6

We agree with that much.

But what I think is not correct is the

7

idea that repossession is fundamentally

8

different.

9

used to satisfy a debt, it doesn't matter

If you're taking property to be

10

whether you sell it or, indeed, whether anyone

11

sells it.

12

If Jones lends Smith $100 and then

13

Smith can't pay and then Jones says, well, I'll

14

take your watch, that's debt collection whether

15

Jones keeps the watch for 80 years or sells it

16

the next day.

17

difference.

18

The sale doesn't make a

And more importantly, to the -- the

19

other aspect of debt collection that Petitioner

20

highlights, the incentives that are created or

21

the message that's sent, surely with

22

repossession, that -- that would fall within

23

his general definition as well.

24

sends a powerful message that if you don't pay

25

you're not getting your car back.

The tow truck

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

So I think the consumer or the debtor

2

in Petitioner's view would equally get that

3

message that we must repay if I want my

4

property back.

5

there's no purpose at all for this second

6

definition.

So, on Petitioner's view,

7

I'd like to touch on a few of the --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

question on what you mean?

Can I ask you one
Imagine we have a

10

person just like this one, he's trying to

11

enforce a securities interest and he doesn't

12

ask for any deficiency payment.

13

All right.

You say that falls within

14

the f(6) exclusion or that's part 2 that falls

15

in the -- all right.

16

and he says something more and he gets into 1,

17

but you're also worried about the state law.

18

But, if he goes further

And you don't want to create a

19

situation where the state law says go through

20

this procedure and they can't do it because of

21

this Act.

22

exactly like this one, doesn't ask for a

23

deficiency payment, and then that does violate

24

some sections of this outside of f(6) and there

25

is no state law requiring it?

What happens if the person is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

MR. BOND:

So I think --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So he -- there --

3

there is a state law for -- I guess here

4

requiring you to go to newspapers.

5

state law requiring you to communicate.

6

There is a

Well, what happens in the government's

7

view, if it's just the same as here, but that

8

last mentioned state law requiring you to

9

advertise in newspapers, for example, doesn't

10
11

exist?
MR. BOND:

So, in that circumstance,

12

if you're going beyond the procedures set forth

13

in state law to enforce a security interest --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. BOND:

-- then you're not within

16

this part 2 definition.

17

debt collection.

18

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are engaged in

Well, that's the part

19

that puzzles me, because -- exactly what I

20

thought you would say, and can I -- can you

21

explain it a little, because, if you're outside

22

of the main thing, part 1, and only covered by

23

f(6), because you did certain things, I want

24

the house, and I'm not saying anything about

25

deficiency, just what happened here, if you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

outside it for the instance where you get a

2

conflict with state law, why wouldn't you be

3

outside it for the instance where you don't get

4

a conflict with state law?

5

MR. BOND:

So it's not about what

6

state law requires for its own sake.

It's

7

about identifying what's within the four

8

corners of enforcement of a security interest,

9

the text Congress used.

And the best and at

10

least the first place to look are the

11

procedures state law outlines to do that.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, in other words,

13

you're saying if the state were exactly the

14

same, but it just didn't say anything about

15

newspapers, then his client would win?

16
17

MR. BOND:

So I think that does

present a trickier question where --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. BOND:

20
21

-- where the state law

doesn't -JUSTICE BREYER:

22

they're out.

23

behavior is identical.

24
25

Why?

If they're out,

They're in, they're in.

MR. BOND:

Their

Because, if the state law

prescribes the procedure that you're going

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

through, it's relatively easy for courts to

2

determine that what you are doing is enforcing

3

a security interest.

4

If you're doing something that state

5

law doesn't require, then you have the more

6

difficult question of, under the general

7

definition, the first part 1 definition, does

8

this conduct constitute debt collection?

9

So, if you engage in repossession or

10

any other enforcement of a security interest,

11

but you also send a demand letter, that demand

12

letter is --

statute uses the language primary purpose debt

21

collection, primary purpose security interest,

22

sentences 1 and 3.

23

The -- the

Are you saying that the test of a

24

bank's primary purpose is whether it's taking

25

an action necessary under state law to collect

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

on a security interest or to enforce a security

2

interest?

3

MR. BOND:

So there are two separate

4

things here.

5

be your primary purpose under the part 2

6

definition.

7

To be a debt collector, it has to

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

But -- but

8

-- but, in that third sentence, it also uses

9

that language, primary purpose.

10

MR. BOND:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Exactly right.
Is your answer that

12

we determine that by reference to state law and

13

what is mandated in order to collect on a

14

security interest or to enforce a security

15

interest?

16

MR. BOND:

We -- we determine whether

17

what you're doing is security interest

18

enforcement by looking at state law, that's

19

right, to determine whether your steps, the

20

actions you've taken, are the things that are

21

set forth in state law.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Thank you.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All right.

I

No, so if state law,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

if a state's non-judicial foreclosure process

also allows the creditor to get a deficiency

judgment, what in your view follows from that?

MR. BOND:

5

the creditor does.

judicial foreclosure action and seeks a

deficiency judgment -- if I may finish -- then

8

that conduct would be debt collection.

9

So I think you look to what

that's not debt collection.

enforcement of a security interest.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18
19

MR. GEYSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

20

I'd like to start with 1692i because

21

we heard very little about it from the other

22

side.

23

judgments.

24

action to enforce an interest in real property

25

securing the consumer's obligation.

1692i does not mention deficiency
Its plain text is targeting an

That's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

foreclosure.

2

And it says specifically that this

3

applies to debt collectors under the main

4

definition who bring a legal action on a debt

5

against a consumer.

6

this is regulating debt collectors but not debt

7

collection when Congress is using that type of

8

language.

9

It's a bit much to say

That's such a key point for us because

10

it shows that Congress understood that these

11

two categories from these two sentences are not

12

mutually exclusive.

13

that it is very odd to say that Congress would

14

have read language that clearly is an expansion

15

as an exclusion.

16

drafts exclusions.

17

And the Court is right

That's not how Congress

And they don't draft it in this

18

statute that way, which we know because they

19

have a series of exclusions that does not

20

include security enforcement.

21

My friend suggested that repo activity

22

is just a sliver.

This is an entire industry.

23

And it's absolutely clear that a repossession

24

agent does not want to make any contact with

25

the consumer.

That's their goal, because, if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
71
1

there's a breach of the peace, they can't take

2

the car and they don't get paid.

3

The government suggested that repo

4

activity is exactly the same as liquidating the

5

car.

6

argument is they're focusing on the wrong

7

person.

8
9

The problem with the government's

1692a(6) has a specific focus on the
person and their individual activity.

The repo

10

agent's role is limited in the process.

11

Chronologically, it comes before there is any

12

debt collection on the repossessed item because

13

it's a secured creditor after the fact that's

14

sending the notice and a secured creditor after

15

the fact that's selling the car, which makes it

16

different.

17

For the conflicts issue with state

18

law, the -- the conflicts here are not nearly

19

-- and, first of all, there aren't actual

20

conflicts.

21

this Court has adequately dealt with in Heinz

22

versus Jenkins when you have an entire state

23

court procedure and state court rules.

24

you look to the real conflicts with the

25

publication notice, they're easily accounted

They're not nearly as jarring as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

When

Official - Subject to Final Review
72
1

for by having the creditor send them or by

2

getting advanced consent from the consumer to

3

provide the necessary approval at the time of

4

the foreclosure, which other courts have looked

5

at.

6

And the position that we're taking has

7

been the rule in multiple jurisdictions now,

8

some for decades, including in Colorado for

9

half a -- for a quarter century.

There has

10

been no demonstrated effect on any state law

11

foreclosure scheme.

12

Foreclosures are taking place

13

regularly.

There's no actual proven injury to

14

the state's interest, which is probably why not

15

a single state showed up today with an amicus

16

brief suggesting that this was somehow

17

offensive to their personal schemes.

18

If there are no further questions.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm assuming that

20

to the extent judicial foreclosures have been

21

viewed as debt collection, that whatever

22

conflicts have worked out there have also been

23

-- that have happened there have also been

24

worked out?

25

MR. GEYSER:

Oh, absolutely, which is

why that it's -- it's very easy to accommodate

these interests.

understood that, in the foreclosure context,

you could have someone enforcing a security

interest and still qualify under the main
