ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS A. CHAITEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. CHAITEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The separate sovereigns exception to

12

the Double Jeopardy Clause is inconsistent with

13

the text and original meaning of the Double

14

Jeopardy Clause.

15

text of the clause was understood to

16

incorporate English practice.

17

practice of intersovereign successive

18

prosecutions in all of English history or in

19

American history for the first century of this

20

republic after their framing.

21

There is no dispute that the

And there was no

There's also a mountain of affirmative

22

evidence that in England, even a foreign

23

acquittal by a court of competent and current

24

-- concurrent jurisdiction bars a subsequent

25

prosecution in England for the -- for the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your -­

Excuse me, Chief.
Your leading

authority is a foreign prosecution in England

8

of the -- in the Spanish case.

9

argument on the other side, which has some

And the

10

traction, I think, is that it would be quite

11

unusual or surprising for the new American

12

republic to look to Europe in a question like

13

that because one concern, and it applies both

14

in the English situation as well, is that it

15

would be a significant intrusion on

16

sovereignty, a particular concern of the new -­

17

new American republic, to allow a foreign

18

prosecution to limit the authority of -- of the

19

surprising even in the -- the English case.

the English court really have said, well, he

was tried in Spain, so we're -- our hands are

tied?

4

MR. CHAITEN:

Well, there's

5

overwhelming evidence, as I said, that that is

6

the English rule, and there's no dispute that

7

the framers were incorporating English practice

8

into the Double Jeopardy Clause.

the world, the judgment from any country in the

5

world.

6

I had asked you any country in

MR. CHAITEN:

So -- so, if you're

7

asking me what the English rule was, I would

8

say yes, that is, but there are three important

9

qualifications on the rule.

First, it -- it

10

does have to be the same offense, so there is

11

no dispute in -- in -- in the case of the

12

murder in Portugal and the trial in England or

13

the murder in -- in the Cape of Good Hope and

14

the trial in England that those were the same

15

offense.

16

They were both murder.
But sometimes that's a little more

17

complicated because it has to be the same

18

elements.

19

"same offense" under this Court's jurisprudence

20

and under the original meaning.

21

That's the -- that's the meaning of

Secondly, and -- and this is very

22

important, the second court has to recognize

23

the competent and concurrent -- concurrent

24

jurisdiction of the first court.

25

that's part of the English rule.

That -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

And there's no dispute -- whatever may

2

arise in the international context, there's no

3

dispute that Alabama and the federal government

4

have competent and concurrent jurisdiction over

5

the offense of being a felon in possession.

6

So, at least in this country, the

7

answer seems pretty clear, because the rule was

8

a concurrent jurisdiction rule, and there's no

9

doubt that there is concurrent jurisdiction.

I

10

don't think the idea, even at the framing, that

11

you would recognize a -- an acquittal in

12

another country as a bar to prosecution could

13

possibly be so shocking because it was

14

mentioned in Furlong.

what's the third requirement?

MR. CHAITEN:

The third requirement is

22

that it can't be a sham prosecution or a

23

collusive prosecution.

24

really -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But then you're never

All right, it can't be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10

a sham.

2

American tourists are murdered by terrorists in

3

a foreign country, and there is a prosecution

4

in the foreign country for murder, the same

5

offense in a court of competent jurisdiction

6

there, and it's not a sham prosecution, but

7

it's a fairly inept prosecution, lack of

8

prosecutorial investigative resources in a poor

9

country, and it results in an acquittal or a

10

So, today, let's say a group of

conviction with a very light sentence.

11

And your position is that there could

12

not be a prosecution here in the United States

13

under the statute enacted by Congress to permit

14

the prosecution of individuals who murder

15

Americans abroad?

16

MR. CHAITEN:

So -- so let me address

17

that in a few different ways.

18

original understanding was that it applied

19

between countries.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. CHAITEN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

One, the

Yeah, well -­
And that -­
-- could you just

answer whether that's correct or not?

24

it's not correct, why is it not correct?

25

MR. CHAITEN:

And if

Under the original

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

understanding, it would be up to the U.S. court

2

to determine whether it's going to recognize

3

the competent and concurrent jurisdiction of

4

that other country.

5

What I'm saying is, in the case of

6

federal and state relations, there is no

7

dispute about that.

So your answer is?

21

Can they be prosecuted here or can they not be

22

prosecuted here?

23

MR. CHAITEN:

The -- the -- the

24

answer, it's not just that the particular court

25

has competent jurisdiction; it's that we're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

going to recognize the jurisdiction of the

2

other country over the crime.

3

point that Furlong was making about the -- the

4

murder of a British subject by a British

5

subject on a British ship, and Furlong says

6

it's pretty doubtful that England would

7

actually recognize a U.S. acquittal in that

8

case because England would say you have no

9

basis for concurrent jurisdiction over that

10

This was the

crime.

11

So that's the determination the U.S.

12

court would make.

You don't have to reach that

13

question in this case.

14

that was the rule at the -- at the -- if that

15

was the original understanding at the time of

16

the framing, if the rule -­

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Our point is that if

Well, we do have

18

to reach -- we do have to reach that question

19

because your position logically would extend to

20

Justice Alito's hypothetical, and if

21

prosecution is part of the national security

22

efforts of the United States, federal

23

prosecution, then your position would

24

substantially hamper those national security

25

efforts.

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. CHAITEN:

So -- so I'm saying the

2

reason you don't have to reach the questions -­

3

obviously, this is a case involving an Alabama

4

crime and -- and -- and a federal crime, and

5

there is -­

your position -­

The logic of our

position, though -- but -- but the point is

10

whatever -- whatever the court's ruling in that

11

case, were it ever to come up, which I think is

12

exceedingly unlikely, this is a different case

13

because it's so much stronger.

14

If the -- if the original

15

understanding was the rule applied between

16

foreign countries, then, a fortiori, it should

17

apply between a state and federal government

18

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, a fortiori, but

whether you have perhaps exaggerated in saying

possibility of a subsequent prosecution in

England.

So it's a foreign prosecution.

MR. CHAITEN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's true, that's

5

not what's involved here, but your -- your

6

argument is based on foreign prosecutions.

7

MR. CHAITEN:

The original

8

understanding was based on foreign

9

prosecutions.

The point is, on the question

10

presented here, a fortiori, it should apply

11

between federal and state government.

12

a principled basis for limiting this to

13

governments bound by the Double Jeopardy Clause

14

if the Court -­

19

MR. CHAITEN:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It did that in -­
-- I think the point

21

is that you're asking us to write an opinion

22

which is based on this original understanding,

23

and the original understanding, as you put it,

24

applies between foreign countries and, a

25

fortiori, it must be that our decision would

apply between foreign countries.
MR. CHAITEN:

understanding is it would.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. CHAITEN:

7

The -- the original

And that's what -­
In Murphy v. Waterfront

Commission -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's -- that's -­

8

that's what your brief was all about.

9

what you're asking us to say, that the original

10

understanding was that there would be no double

11

jeopardy bar between different sovereigns when

12

those sovereigns are foreign countries.

13

could we avoid that consequence?

14

MR. CHAITEN:

That's

So how

Well, first of all, I'm

15

not sure the case is ever going to arise, but

16

-- and this is State of Alabama and federal

17

government and its undisputed concurrent

18

jurisdiction.

The rule is a rule of concurrent

19

jurisdiction.

So it's when is the U.S. going

20

to recognize the concurrent jurisdiction of

21

another country?

22

And, again, I want -- just wanted to

23

say that Murphy v. Waterfront Commission is a

24

case where the court held that the

25

self-incrimination privilege applies

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16

cross-jurisdictionally.

2

limited that to parties bound by the Double

3

Jeopardy Clause.

this if the Court ever gets such a case and

wants to do that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We've been

17

through -- we've been through all this in

18

Bartkus, right?

19

MR. CHAITEN:

I don't think the Court

20

has been -- ever given this question a full and

21

fair opportunity, certainly post-incorporation,

22

and it's important to understand how the

23

holding of this Court arose.

24
25

There was, of course, a suggestion in
Fox v. Ohio in 1847 that there might be a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

separate sovereigns exception.

It was based on

2

a non-incorporation rationale, but no one

3

actually -- it's dicta.

4

because there were no intersovereign successive

5

prosecutions, not only not in that case but no

6

practice of them.

It's the purest dicta,

7

The first time this Court had a chance

8

to actually hold whether that's permissible was

9

Lanza.

And I think it's worth reading the

10

respondent's brief in -- in Lanza, Lanza's

11

brief.

12

position we're presenting here.

13

incoherent, and the Court said I think what

14

counsel is arguing is that the separate

15

sovereigns exception doesn't apply in the

16

particular context of the Eighteenth Amendment,

17

given the concurrent powers of the state and

18

the federal government.

MR. CHAITEN:

So -- so just -- Bartkus

was decided at the same time as Abbate.

3

is the case that answers this particular

4

question.

5

going to adhere to Lanza because none of the

issues that are presented today are different

7

from what was presented in Lanza, which is a

8

really remarkable statement.

the burden of Palko v. Connecticut, and the -­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Court made -­

Could you say a little

15

bit more about why you think incorporation or

16

the lack of incorporation had anything to do

17

with this question?

18

MR. CHAITEN:

Yes.

So Fox v. Ohio, it

19

-- its lead rationale is non-incorporation.

20

And, I mean, I think it's wrong, but it clearly

21

said that and then Lanza picked it up and then

22

Abbate picked it up.

23

Court -­

24
25

And I think what the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, there is that

reference in Fox, but it honestly makes no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

sense that incorporation would be the basis of

2

the doctrine, because if incorporation were the

3

basis of the doctrine, you would have a

4

doctrine that only cuts one way.

5

In other words, it would -- it would

6

-- the Court would have held that the federal

7

government can't prosecute an individual for

8

the same offense after a state prosecution, but

9

not the other way around.

So the fact that

10

there's not a one-way ratchet but that, in

11

fact, it's a symmetrical rule suggests that

12

incorporation has nothing to do with it at all.

13

MR. CHAITEN:

I think what the Court

14

was getting at was the -- I think the -- it was

15

the -- the baronial logic of it was that

16

"offense" must mean federal offense because the

17

Double Jeopardy Clause only applies to the

18

federal government.

19

That's what this Court was getting at.

20

That's what was picked up in Abbate and Lanza,

21

and that's what's no longer true.

22

as a pure -- I don't think it was a legitimate

23

rationale to begin with because it conflates

24

two things that are different, to which

25

government does the clause apply and what prior

So as a -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

offenses count for double jeopardy purposes.

2

That was the rationale.

3

It's interesting, I don't know that

4

the government is defending that rationale.

5

They -- they -- they completely ignore the

6

non-incorporation rationale.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I guess what

8

strikes me, Mr. Chaiten, is that you can say,

9

well, you know, this case was a little bit

10

different.

11

properly presented.

12

is important to look at the rationale when the

Court finally had an opportunity to decide this

and make a holding on it, and that is Lanza.

5

And there's -- nothing resembling an

argument for the original understanding of the

That was picked up in Abbate.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why is the

doctrine wrong?

15

our system of government, because there wasn't

16

and isn't a comparable system in England at the

17

time, there were not separate sovereigns, there

18

was one sovereign, England.

application of the rule there makes absolute

sense in that context.

But the logic of all of our cases

relied on a simple theory of -- of -- of what

24

the sovereignty between the states and the -­

And you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

22

haven't really explained why that logic is not

2

sensical.

3

MR. CHAITEN:

Well, the logic of the

4

English rule as reported in numerous treatises

5

from the early 18th Century through the 20th

6

Century, it's still the rule today, is that

7

where there's a court of concurrent

8

jurisdiction, even if it's another government

9

that has concurrent jurisdiction, then an

10

acquittal there bars a subsequent prosecution.

MR. CHAITEN:

That is my

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question, I

thought, perhaps Justice Kagan and Justice

Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor are asking, as I

understand it, in any case I'm asking it, I -­

16

I -- I have spent a certain amount of time in

these old cases.

18

19

against you, two undecided.

20

quite as clear, but I'll go back and look at

21

them again.

22

I think that Bartkus in this

I don't find it

But suppose you're right.

Maybe

23

Marbury versus Madison was wrong.

Maybe there

24

are mis-cites in all kinds of things.

the door we're opening up.

Look at

And here you've

read the briefs.

that say remember the civil rights world where

3

people were, with victims of a different race,

4

simply killing them or worse, and the state

5

would just, ah, don't worry, they'll never

6

convict, and they didn't.

7

There are -- there are briefs

Or think of the brief here with the

8

Indian tribes.

We're saying that we need this

kind of thing for abuse of women.

10

11

cases that you've seen.

12

And think of

And think of the

Now what I looked for in your briefs

13

which I haven't found yet but for the military

14

is, is it really the case or not that, as a

15

practical matter, if you go back the last 10

16

years or five or whatever it is, you found a

17

whole lot of cases where people were prosecuted

18

twice by different sovereigns for what was the

19

same thing.

20

here in any brief but for the military.

21
22
23

Because I didn't see them listed

And -- and, therefore, to me, that's
an important question.
MR. CHAITEN:

Well -- well, we can't

24

know for sure how many successive prosecutions

25

there are -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CHAITEN:

Of course.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't expect you to

know for sure.

6

MR. CHAITEN:

Well, and I -- well, and

7

I want to say the reason I'm saying we can't

8

know for sure is because the government's

9

Petite policy is a secretive policy that they

10

implement and they don't really share data on

11

it, other than the prosecutions they decline to

12

make.

13

Sources from the early 2000s say that

14

they've authorized 150 Petite authorizations

15

per year.

16

think -- and, first of all, let me step back

17

and say I don't think that should dictate what

the constitutional rule is.

19

number of constitutional violations that

20

triggers this Court's duty to enforce the

Constitution.

22

to believe that the use of this intersovereign

prosecution, particularly federal after state,

for the same crime is increasing.

25

just see the facts of this case.

There's reason to believe, I

There's no minimum

But I think there's every reason

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How much does -­

3

does Blockburger shrink the significance?

4

Because -- because with -- if there's a

5

different element in one, that's enough to take

6

it out of double jeopardy?

7

MR. CHAITEN:

If each has a different

8

-- an element the other doesn't have, then,

9

yes, that's enough to take it out of double

10

jeopardy.

And that's -- that -- that makes

11

sense when you're talking about federal and

12

state government because, if the federal

13

government has made a considered decision that

14

there's some substantial federal interest here,

15

they can write -- they can define the crime in

a way that's probably going to be different

than -- than -- than crimes that states

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that would be

14

the case if the Blockburger rule holds, but

15

your interpretation of the term "offence" in

16

the Fifth Amendment is perhaps inconsistent

17

with the way this Court has interpreted that -­

that concept in Blockburger cases.

19

true?

20

MR. CHAITEN:

Isn't that

I -- I don't think it's

21

the least bit inconsistent.

I think if you

22

look at -- if you look at -- so the -- the

23

current understanding of the Blockburger rule

24

derives from Justice Scalia's dissent in Grady

25

v. Corbin, which had -- which was adopted in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28

Dixon, and it's exactly what we're saying it

2

is.

3

or -- or a lot lesser -­

4

It's a crime defined by the same elements

JUSTICE ALITO:

But didn't he -­

5

didn't he say it is the elements defined by a

6

particular sovereign?

7

MR. CHAITEN:

I -- I don't believe he

8

actually said that in Grady v. Corbin, and I

9

don't think the Court said that in Dixon.

10

There was nothing sovereign-specific about it.

11

The government tries to say that it's -- it -­

12

it -- it's necessarily a rule of legislative

13

intent which makes it sovereign-specific.

14

that -- that is not what -- that is not what

the English authorities said.

interpretation of the original meaning of the

MR. CHAITEN:

In Great Britain?

Well,

4

it -- it's -- it's Hutchinson.

5

holding of Roche was that the plea of autrefois

bar because that -- if that was necessary to

whether -- whether the defendant could plead

MR. CHAITEN:

The -- the mountain -- I

would primarily start with the treatises.

by the way, in the -- in the Grady v. Corbin

4

dissent, the entirety of the English common law

evidence that the Court -- that Justice Scalia

6

relied on, that then became the opinion of the

pre-ratification case that was dicta, and one

post-ratification case that adopted it.

that was -- that was the way the originalist

inquiry happened.

The scholars -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess -- I

20

guess the -- the question that underlies

21

Justice Breyer's question about civil rights is

22

something along the lines of:

23

consistent with our structure of government.

24

We have dual sovereigns.

25

regulation.

You know, that's

That means dual

And dual regulation often means

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38

dual punishment.

2

And if we were to adopt the rule that

3

you suggest, it might very well be that either

4

the federal government would have to

5

subordinate its interests to the states or that

6

the states would have to subordinate their

7

interests to the federal government.

8

And one of the things about our

9

constitutional structure makes -- which makes

10

it unusual is that -- is that both sovereigns

11

are understood to have significant interests

12

that they have the capacity to pursue.

13

MR. CHAITEN:

But where they have the

14

concurrent jurisdiction over something that is

15

the same offense, that is illegitimate for

16

reasons that were understood at the framing.

17

Take the cases of -- take Furlong.

18

case where multiple sovereigns have concurrent

19

jurisdiction over robbery at sea, and it was

20

well understood that a prosecution by one would

21

bar a prosecution by another.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

That's a

Well, I read

23

Furlong a little bit differently, as actually

separating out the offense of piracy, which was

jurisdiction rule, and they were saying why

12

would the U.S. have concurrent jurisdiction

13

over that.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I suppose my -- my

15

main question, which actually goes back to

16

Justice Gorsuch's question, because Justice

17

Gorsuch has been trying to lead you away from

18

something, and I'm a little bit also confused

19

as -- as to why your argument seems, frankly, a

20

little bit one note.

21

You know, your -- your brief and now

22

your argument is just all about the original

23

jurisdiction.

24

this bench that think that that is the alpha

25

and omega of every constitutional question.

And there are some people on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

But there are other people on this

2

bench who do not, who think that 170 years of

3

significant practice where 30 Justices have

4

signed on to a rule, that you're going to have

5

to give me more than the fact that, you know,

6

actually, pretty early on in the republic they

7

decided that that was not what the original

8

understanding was, even if they're wrong.

9

MR. CHAITEN:

10
11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -­
And so this is your

opportunity to give me more.

12

MR. CHAITEN:

Okay.

1922, I would

13

say.

14

your offering me an opportunity to give you

15

more, I will tell you incorporation.

16

Incorporation, incorporation, incorporation.

17

But my opportunity in response to your -­

The Court has said its own precedents

18

are that incorporation makes a big difference

19

for purposes of stare decisis.

20

So look at Elkins and look at -- look

21

at Murphy v. Waterfront Commission.

22

incorporation, the federal government and the

23

state government shouldn't be able to combine

24

to do that which they can't do alone.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

After

Part of -- part of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

the original understanding as well was stare

2

decisis, and stare decisis is a principle, in

3

my view, rooted in Article III, as Federalist

4

78 points out and as Justice Kagan points out.

5

It's a doctrine of stability and humility that

6

we take very seriously.

7

And the reason -- with the bar that

8

you have to clear, I believe, is not just to

9

show that it's wrong but to show that it's

10

grievously wrong, egregiously wrong, something

11

meaning a very high bar because stare decisis

12

is itself a constitutional principle.

13

And given, as Justice Alito says, the

14

uncertainty about the history, can you clear

15

that bar?

16

So two questions.

Is that the right

17

way to look at it, grievously wrong, and -­

18

and, two, how can you clear that given some of

19

the uncertainty?

20

MR. CHAITEN:

So -- so I'm not sure

21

grievously wrong is the right way to look at it

22

when you're talking about an unconstitutional

23

law enforcement practice because this Court has

24

never upheld an unconstitutional -­

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But that's begging

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

-- that's begging the question.

2

point is that there are prior decisions going

3

back, as Justice Kagan says, many years,

4

reaffirming this doctrine.

5

The whole

And the question is, when are we going

6

to upset that stability, when are we going to

7

depart from the humility of respecting

8

precedent and overrule it?

9

MR. CHAITEN:

So -­

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

11

has to be -- your -- your brief uses

12

egregiously wrong.

13

grievously wrong.

14

I mean, usually it

I -- I use the term

MR. CHAITEN:

Well, and I agree this

15

-- this rule is egregiously wrong.

16

that -- there was no practice for all of

17

English history, no practice for the first

18

century of this republic.

19

speaks volumes.

20

It's a rule

That alone, I think,

And the -- I think, going back to

21

incorporation, I think, in addition to just how

22

wrong the rule is, as explained by many jurists

23

and many scholars over many decades, I think

24

incorporation -- the Court has never had a full

25

and fair opportunity post-incorporation to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Throughout its history, this Court has
correctly recognized that the distinct and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

separate sovereign powers of the state and

2

federal governments make state and federal

3

crimes different offenses under the Double

4

Jeopardy Clause.

5

Petitioner provides no reason for this

6

Court suddenly to conclude that it's been wrong

7

all this time.

8

precedent on this issue is going to invite a

9

whole host of problems that this Court has thus

far been able to avoid.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, 170

12

years, I -- I think your friend is right, isn't

13

it, that we have not had a full consideration

14

and exposition of the issue in any of our

15

precedents?

16

MR. FEIGIN:

17

correct, Your Honor.

18

pointed out earlier in the argument, the

19

historical point that he is making here and

20

that is the centerpiece of his argument, that

21

even prosecutions by a foreign sovereign can

22

bar domestic prosecution by a state or by the

23

United States, was fully before the Court in

24

Bartkus.

25

I don't think that's
I think, as you yourself

The Grant article that is all over the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

Petitioner's brief and that Petitioner's

2

counsel cited at argument today was cited by

3

Justice Black in his dissent in Bartkus.

4

all the authorities on which he's relying, with

5

the exception of Roche, which, correctly

6

understood, doesn't actually announce this

7

rule, were identified by Justice Frankfurter

8

for the majority in Footnote 9.

9

And

And the Court found these authorities

10

to be dubious and of limited value in -­

11

because they don't really speak to our

12

federalism.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you have

14

to concede, won't you, that this rule, this

15

separate sovereign rule, has been widely

16

criticized by both academics and federal

17

judges?

18

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, it has come

19

under some criticism.

20

noting is a lot of the articles that criticize

21

it also recognize that some exceptions are

22

necessary and that successive prosecutions and

23

separate prosecutions are sometimes necessary

24

to vindicate particular sovereign interests.

25

I think what's worth

So take the civil rights brief that my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

friend was just mentioning.

2

this Court, if it goes for the position the

3

Petitioner's advocating, should then announce a

4

separate constitutional doctrine that save

5

civil rights prosecutions.

6

They think that

And that's because they realize the

7

enormous consequences that overturning all this

8

precedent would have.

9

What's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the

10

answer to the civil rights cases is it's not

11

the same offense, 241 and 242.

12

state law counterparts to those.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

There are no

Your Honor, those aren't

14

the only civil rights charges we bring.

15

the recent shootings by -- the recent shootings

16

of the synagogue in Pittsburgh and of the

17

African-American church in Charleston, we've

18

charged those with offenses that -- I mean, I

19

can get into the details if you'd like, but

20

they're essentially murder plus a bunch of

21

elements.

22
23

And those would be Block -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- once -- once you

2

say "a bunch of elements," then you get into

3

Blockburger.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

No, Your Honor, murder

5

would be a less -- considered a lesser-included

6

offense of those offenses if the offense is

7

defined by different sovereigns were considered

8

the same, as Petitioner is urging.

9

-- that's not even the only consequence.

10

But those

Even the -- there are a number of

11

categories of cases that would be put at issue

12

here.

13

those in a moment, but before I get to that,

14

even the possibility of claims like this

15

creates adverse consequences for law

16

enforcement, for legislatures, and for courts.

17

And I -- I can get into more detail in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you had

18

-- you must think that there's some problem or

19

you wouldn't have the Petite policy.

20

that's -- that's an odd defense of a -- of a -­

21

a position to say, well, we take care of it

22

somewhere else, so don't worry about it.

23

MR. FEIGIN:

I mean,

Well, no, Your Honor, I

24

think there are a number of instances,

25

including the Double Jeopardy Clause just last

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

term, where a plurality of this Court has

2

recognized the Constitution doesn't solve every

3

potential policy problem that may arise, and we

4

leave those -- a lot of those questions for

5

legislatures or for the political branches in

6

general.

7

And I think this has actually been a

8

real success story of that because he was just

9

asked if he could point to any significant

10

practical problems, and he couldn't.

11

point to a lot of practical problems that are

12

going to arise if this Court adopts his rule.

13

But I can

So, on the law enforcement side, just

14

the possibility that this could happen is going

15

to deter cooperation, encourage aggressive

16

prosecutions, a race to the courthouse, and

17

defendants trying to play each sovereign off

18

against the other where one sovereign will have

19

the ability to unilaterally bargain away the

20

other sovereign's ability to enforce its

21

interests.

22

some concrete examples of that in a second.

23

And I'd -- I'd like to get into

But, as to legislatures, he said it

24

himself, he's going to -- this would

It's the same crime, federal and

What is the manipulation that you see

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, the -­

the examples I would get into, and I'm happy to

10

get into them, are examples of cases in which

11

state and federal interests would be blocked.

12

But speaking to this particular case, I don't

13

think there's any dispute, at least by

14

Petitioner, that the federal government has a

15

substantial interest in regulating access to

16

the interstate market for firearms by someone

17

who has twice fired weapons that endangered

18

members of his own family and other members of

19

the community.

20

The only question is whether that

21

substantial federal interest was vindicated

22

when he entered into an omnibus plea deal with

23

the state where he wound up, as a practical

24

matter, not receiving any additional time in

25

prison for the firearm offense.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but I think

2

that's exactly the problem that is practically

3

more apparent today or at least of potential

4

concern that counsel might have addressed, and

5

that is with the proliferation of federal

6

crimes, I think over 4,000 statutes now and

7

several hundred thousand regulations, the

8

opportunity to -- for the government to seek a

9

successive prosecution if it's unhappy with

10

even the most routine state prosecution is a

11

problem.

12

Justice Brennan was concerned about it

13

in Bartkus.

14

evidence of manipulation even by federal

15

authorities to secure a second conviction in

16

state court.

17

In that case, there was some

Why shouldn't that be a practical

18

concern we ought to be more concerned about

19

today?

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, let me say a few

21

things about that, Your Honor.

I mean, the

22

reason we have the Petite policy is we do

23

understand that successive prosecutions are

24

very often inappropriate and we try to reserve

25

them for circumstances in which the federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

interest hasn't been vindicated.

2

But I think, to the extent that -­

3

that there's a concern about successive

4

prosecutions, it's not so much successive

5

prosecutions based on a particular law of one

6

sovereign or another; it's successive

7

prosecutions for the same conduct all raise

8

those concerns.

9

But everyone agrees that successive

10

prosecutions for the same conduct don't raise

11

any double jeopardy concerns.

12

Petite policy, Mr. Chief Justice, is somewhat

13

broader.

14

prosecution following a state or federal

15

disposition for the same act or transaction.

16

That's why the

It covers a -- a subsequent federal

But, to get back to your question,

17

Justice Gorsuch, I think that makes the Double

18

Jeopardy Clause not necessarily the appropriate

19

vessel for vindicating that concern.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, you know, I

21

wonder about that because, in our prior cases,

22

we hinged on two things, in Bartkus, among

23

other places.

24

were concerned that the federal government

25

would be at a disadvantage compared to states

One was incorporation, and we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53

without this rule because states were not bound

2

then by the Double Jeopardy Clause and could

3

pursue a second prosecution after a failed

4

federal prosecution.

5

reverse be true, we thought.

6

So why shouldn't the

That rationale has now disappeared

7

with incorporation.

And we've since revisited

8

a very similar -- similar issue in the Fourth

9

Amendment context in Elkins, where we used to

10

allow federal prosecutors to use illegally

11

obtained evidence, and now we don't.

12

So that rationale seems to have, in

13

fact, changed over time.

14

-- one argument.

15

other is, again, with the -- with the -- in

16

Bartkus, we relied on the -- on the -- and

17

elsewhere on -- on the promise that prosecutors

18

wouldn't do this in routine cases.

19

So that might be one

And then -- and then the

And, you know, at least to some eyes,

20

this might look like a pretty routine case,

21

where -- as did Bartkus itself.

22

shouldn't we be concerned about those two

23

things?

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

And why

Well, Your Honor, we

don't view this as a routine case.

We don't -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

first of all, you have to understand that the

2

set of cases that could even come under the

3

Petite policy is already a very selective

4

group.

5

very many criminal cases as compared to the

6

states.

The federal government doesn't charge

7

And then we don't -- our number of

8

Petite policy approvals each year is about a

9

hundred.

And this case is important to us

10

because it's a part of a program called

11

Operation Safe Neighborhoods.

12

have shown, by focusing on recidivist offenders

13

like Petitioner, we've reduced crime in some

14

neighborhoods by up to 42 percent.

The case studies

15

But even if you don't like this

16

prosecution, let me give you a few other

17

examples of the kinds of cases that are going

18

to be barred under his rule.

19

First, there's the foreign judgment

20

problem that the Court was discussing with

21

Petitioner's counsel.

And that's not just a

22

hypothetical problem.

That's a real one.

23

And let me give you a real example.

24

In 2003, the FARC rebels in Colombia kidnapped

25

American journalists and held them hostage for

Now I'm not certain whether those

charges -- jeopardy actually attached in those

8

cases under Colombian law or exactly what the

9

elements of the Colombian law were, but that's

10

precisely the inquiry we don't want courts to

11

have to have.

12
13

And we certainly don't want to have to

sure how far the proceedings with respect to

17

each and every individual rebel we might charge

18

in Colombia got.

19

this -- and I can give you other examples as

well, but just to finish this one up, his only

solution to this is to ask the federal

There's the bombing

in Pakistan, and the U.S. might want to try

16

that bomber as well.

One of the bombers has been tried

17

His rule would preclude that.

18

again, his only solution is to ask a U.S. court

19

to declare that some foreign court is not a

court of competent jurisdiction.

individual?

4

because it's a protection of the liberty of the

5

individual, but here the party being

6

strengthened is not the individual, it is the

7

state's freedom and the federal government's

8

freedom to bring -- to prosecute the same

9

offense, felon in possession.

10

Federalism is usually invoked

MR. FEIGIN:

So I think the Court's

11

recognized in older cases like Cruikshank,

12

which was from the 19th century, and in its

13

recent first decision in Bond against United

14

States that one of the things that American

15

citizens get by being citizens of both the

16

state and the United States is that there are

17

two sovereigns that can positively legislate;

18

that is, pass affirmative legislation to

19

protect them.

20

So in the civil rights era when the

21

states weren't affirmatively protecting the

22

civil rights of their citizens enough, they're

23

also American citizens, and the United States

24

stepped in to vindicate those interests.

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, there are

4

civil rights offenses on the books now, like 18

5

U.S.C. 249, which precludes -- criminalizes

6

causing bodily injury to someone for racially

7

motivated reasons that could be double jeopardy

But let me give you -- let me give you

10

some other examples of -­

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But counsel, just -­

12

before we get to more examples, I thought

13

Justice Ginsburg's point was worth exploring a

14

little more.

15

I had thought in this country that the

16

people were the sovereign and that sovereignty

17

was divided, exercise of sovereignty was

18

divided, not multiplied.

19

So it was divided between the federal

20

government and the state governments, Ninth and

21

Tenth Amendment.

22

it, to say that there are two sovereigns who

23

get to multiply offenses against you?

24
25

And that it is awkward, isn't

I can't think of another case where
federalism is used, as Justice Ginsburg

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

indicated, to allow greater intrusions against

2

the person, rather than to protect more against

3

them.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, the

5

people have vested the sovereignty in both the

6

state and the United States -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there such an

8

example?

Is there such an example, other than

9

double jeopardy, where the individual has a

10

double whammy, both the state and the federal,

11

usually federalism, as Justice Gorsuch just

12

pointed out, are protective of the individual?

13

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, it is a

14

common fact of life that everyone is subject to

15

both state and federal regulation.

16

everyone in this room, except maybe my friends

17

from Texas, pay both state and federal taxes.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. FEIGIN:

It's why

It's why businesses are

20

regulated by both the federal and state

21

governments, and why everyone knows that an

22

act, and even Petitioner agrees, the same act

23

can be both a state and federal crime.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what about the

adoption of the Black -- the Blockburger rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, I think

federalism, in a way.

defendants to prosecution for the same acts in

10

MR. FEIGIN:

And yet it exposes

I think that's right,

11

Your Honor.

It would respect the judgments of

12

the legislatures as to how they wanted to craft

13

their crimes.

15

MR. FEIGIN:

16

It's -- it's -­

Blockburger hasn't

heretofore been -­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a double

18

jeopardy.

19

whether it's Blockburger or this case.

20

outside the realm of double jeopardy, is there

21

such an instance?

22

We're talking about double jeopardy,

MR. FEIGIN:

I asked

Your Honor, I -- I think

23

I've just given several examples of cases where

24

people are regulated more heavily because there

25

are two governments than -- than they would if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

they were subject only to one unitary

2

government.

3

That's a necessary consequence of our

4

system.

5

recognized it.

6

And the Court has repeatedly

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask, Mr. Feigin,

7

do you think that there is a prospect of abuse

8

where two different governments can use the

9

possibility of prosecutions as a bargaining

10

tactic to get defendants to agree to plea

11

deals?

12

regularly?

13

Is -- is that something that happens

MR. FEIGIN:

I'm not really familiar

14

with that being a serious problem under the

15

current system.

16

actually be the opposite under the new

17

unprecedented system that Petitioner is asking

18

this Court to adopt, where someone could go

19

into the state prosecutors, someone -- let's

20

say someone's caught in California with 100

21

kilograms of marijuana, which is a misdemeanor

22

in California, as the states point out in their

23

brief, but is a felony under federal law.

24
25

I think the main concern would

And he agrees to plead to the state
offense, and, therefore, that would bar a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

federal prosecution for possession with intent

2

to distribute, which would be considered under

3

his rule a greater offense.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you remember

5

what the situation was in the D.C., not so very

6

long ago, when we had the same prosecutor for

7

the local courts and the federal court?

8

the D.C. court had lower penalties than the

9

U.S. code and the prosecutor engaged in just

10

that kind of tactic.

11

D.C. code, and if you don't, I'm going to

12

indict you under the U.S. code.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

And

Plead guilty under the

Well, Your Honor, D.C. is

14

kind of a special case where both of those fall

15

under federal government.

16

Rico, in that sense, in that they are not

17

separate sovereigns.

18

It's like Puerto

But here is another problem we have

19

run into in Puerto Rico.

Now the -- we can't

20

charge -- we can't rely on the separate

21

sovereign understanding of the Double Jeopardy

22

Clause there, is that the territorial

23

prosecutors in Puerto Rico don't view the

24

prosecution of crime in quite the same way as

25

the federal government does.

They're more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

concerned with crime of a transactional nature,

2

rather than necessarily developing longer term

3

investigations.

4

And so one thing that they do is they

5

frequently prosecute drug conspiracies that

6

last only for one day, an agreement just to

7

sell particular drugs from a particular

8

location on a particular day.

9

And at least one district court has

10

dismissed a federal indictment for broader drug

11

conspiracy that occurred for over a range of

12

years on the ground that it was simply a

13

greater included offense of the smaller Puerto

14

Rico drug conspiracy.

15

And that's just a consequence of the

16

different ways in which the state and the

17

federal government use their resources and the

18

ways in which they want to prosecute crime.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Are -­

Another difficulty that's

21

going to arise here is prosecutions by the

22

federal government that follow tribal

23

prosecutions, which I think are about

24

two-thirds of the -- of the few hundred

25

successive prosecutions that we bring each

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1
2

year.
And as this Court recognized a couple

3

of terms ago in United States against Bryant,

4

the federal government plays a critical role in

5

curbing the serious problem of domestic

6

violence against Native American women.

7

Tribes are limited generally to

8

prosecuting only for misdemeanors.

So if they

9

find that someone has been committing domestic

10

abuse, the most that they can do is prosecute

11

that person for a misdemeanor.

12

Under federal law, 18 U.S.C. 117(a),

13

we can prosecute for -- recidivist domestic

14

abusers for a felony.

And the tribes bring -­

MR. FEIGIN:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

And what is -­

The tribes bring -­
What is the reasons

for the tribe's very limited jurisdiction?
MR. FEIGIN:

So the tribes have

20

limited jurisdiction as a consequence of

21

federal law.

22

more serious offenses in exchange for providing

23

more protections in their courts.

Some tribes are allowed to do

24

Very few have decided they want to

25

make that tradeoff because it would require

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

them to dispense with some of the traditional

2

accoutrements of tribal justice that are

3

important to their traditions.

4

So as the Court noted in United States

5

against Wheeler, justice in tribal courts is

6

more focused on restitution between the

7

defendant and the victim and less focused on

8

incarceration and deterrence and the kinds of

9

treatment programs that they can receive in

10

federal prison, but that they not going to be

11

able to -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see the problem.

I

13

just wondered if you want to say a few words on

14

a slightly different thing, which I don't know

15

if you have anything to add to what's in my

16

mind, and I have never been able to formulate a

17

principle.

18

All right.

I looked at the history,

19

it's not just a footnote 9.

20

discussion in Frankfurter's opinion, which is

21

on your side, but they have a pretty strong

22

argument on their side.

23

It's a whole

Then you've pointed to some

24

problems -- and I'm sure they are real ones -­

25

but they don't seem like overwhelming ones in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

terms of how often they occur.

2

Well, it's 100 cases where this applies every

3

year in the federal part and there are also 20

4

states, probably 50,000 federal prosecutions,

5

something like that, there are a hundred cases,

6

and this has been around for 70 years, at

7

least, 170, possibly, or somewhere in between.

8
9

Then you say:

So how am I supposed to decide in your
opinion about whether their arguments, which

10

are past, plus a certain unfairness, which

11

Justice Black says pretty well outweighs the

12

stare decisis.

14

develop a -- a way of coordinating which cases

you're going to file in first and which ones

24

they're going to file in first?

And so what's most likely is that you

history of this nation has shown that the

5

eye to eye on matters of criminal law

6

enforcement, and there are going to be cases in

8

I think the

You could imagine federal prosecutors

sorry, state prosecutors in California, as a

11

protest against federal marijuana laws,

12

allowing anyone who's caught with 50 kilograms

of marijuana to walk in and plead to a

misdemeanor to frustrate federal prosecutions.

15

There are also going to be cases where

the state prosecutors simply don't have perfect

information or maybe the federal prosecutors

18

don't.

19

something and just think it's a simple assault,

20

it's hard to put an exact percentage on it, but

principle that no court in the United States

20

versus another, state versus federal.

21

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, it's

22

true that there are 20 states that have enacted

23

a general sort of bar on their ability to bring

24

a prosecution based on conduct that was already

25

prosecuted by another sovereign.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There are some quirks and differences

2

within those states, but I think it's important

3

to note that 14 of those 20 states are a part

4

of our coalition today.

that decision and those types of policy

considerations to the states, which are already

They have signed on to

example.

12

the federal government has already brought a

13

prosecution based on the same conduct.

14

recently as 2003, following the 9/11 attacks,

15

Virginia amended its law to make an exception

16

for terrorism cases.

17

shows that states are capable of recognizing

the fairness concerns and the policy concerns

22

that Petitioner raises and legislating

23

appropriately.

24
25

I think the Virginia example

In asking the Court not to overturn
its long-standing interpretation, we'd like to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

emphasize a couple of points.

2

Petitioner's position would create a litany of

3

practical problems that could harm state

4

interests.

5

First,

And I'd like to go through a number of

6

examples of those.

7

in which state A has a tougher penalty for a

8

particular type of conduct than does state B.

9

That, of course, is the fact pattern of Heath

10

First, imagine a situation

v. Alabama.

11

Under Petitioner's view, state A would

12

not be able to vindicate its interest in that

13

sterner prosecution, if state B were to go

14

first.

15

play out if a state has a sterner penalty for a

16

particular act than does the federal

17

government.

18

That could -- that situation could also

This Court, of course, saw that in the

19

Screws case, where the state penalty was much

20

stronger than the federal penalty.

21

that in, for example, the area of robbery.

22

We also see

Under federal law a robbery of a U.S.

23

letter carrier carrying U.S. mail is punishable

24

by up to ten years.

25

is punishable by up to 20 years.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think what your

friends on the other side might say to that is

5

something along the lines of:

thing to pick the higher penalty and, you know,

7

let the state or the -- or the government with

8

the higher penalty go forward.

9

with this is that you can get both.

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, it's one

The problem

11

Honor, oftentimes as a practical matter there

problem that would arise under Petitioner's

theory, suppose that a state had a particular

15

interest in prosecuting a drug kingpin in that

state.

18

But suppose another practical

Well, unbeknownst to the state, the

19

U.S. government is also looking at that kingpin

20

in connection with a different federal

21

prosecution.

22

federal government could enter into a plea

23

agreement with that criminal in exchange for

24

testimony in some other matter that's of grave

25

concern to the federal government.

Now, unbeknownst to the state the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The states might not know about that

2

until it's too late.

3

would not be able to vindicate their interest

in prosecuting public enemy number 1.

5
6

At that point the states

And, of course, as the discussion
earlier -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would

8

certainly limit the willingness of the

9

defendant to cooperate, if that -- if that were

10
11
12
13

the rule.
MR. HAWKINS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Can you please repeat that?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the -- if the -­

14

if the defendant could be re-prosecuted by the

15

state that would be a disincentive to entering

16

into a plea bargain if he can -- if he can just

17

be subject to prosecution by another sovereign

18

for the same conduct.

19

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, I suppose

20

that may be theoretically true, but as my

21

friend from the federal government indicated,

22

we don't have any evidence that that's the

23

case, and I don't believe that Petitioner has

24

pointed to any.

25

As was discussed earlier, we could

also see this play out as to foreign

2

prosecutions.

4

for example.

that this individual had trafficked large

amounts of drugs into the state of Florida and

devastated local Florida communities.

Imagine a situation involving a

Suppose that Florida could show

and a local Medellin jury were to try and

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, yes, Your Honor,

17

if -- if there were drugs being trafficked by

18

the -- by Escobar and a cartel into the state

19

of Florida, that would certainly implicate the

20

interests of Florida.

21

And under Petitioner's theory -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but I asked

23

about the Colombia?

24

in Florida against Florida residents -­

25

MR. HAWKINS:

If the crime is committed

Well, Your Honor, my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
84
1

hypothetical I am making assumes that there's

2

some sort of Colombian law against trafficking

3

drugs out of that country into another country.

4

We can certainly imagine that being the case in

5

-- in many scenarios.

6

Other practical concerns that would

7

arise, as my friend from the Department of

8

Justice indicated, would involve races to the

9

courthouse and competition between states and

10

the federal government, rather than

11

cooperation, all to the detriment of law

12

enforcement.

13

And even setting aside these practical

14

problems, there are a number of other concerns

15

that Petitioner's view would raise.

16

under Petitioner's view, courts around this

17

country would be for the first time asked to

18

apply Blockburger across the federal and state

19

divide.

20

First,

That is no easy thing to do.

This

21

Court has experienced a taste of that in its

22

Armed Career Criminal Act jurisprudence where

23

the Court has tried to do something similar to

24

that, has developed the modified categorical

25

approach and other doctrines to try to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
85
1

accomplish that.

2

It's no easy matter to do that.

That

3

problem would even be compounded if this Court

4

were to declare a ruling for Petitioner to be

5

retroactive.

6

Anybody who had been convicted or even

7

charged, really, a second time based on similar

8

conduct would challenge that prosecution as

9

unconstitutional under this Court's rule.

And

10

then, of course, a Court in reviewing that, if

11

the rule were retroactive, would have to go

12

back through history and apply Blockburger, not

13

just across the federal and state divide, but

14

also as a historical matter as to offenses that

15

may have changed over time.

16

Finally, setting all of these

17

practical problems aside, I think it's

18

important to note that Petitioner seeks to take

19

us into uncharted waters.

20

he imagines has never been the rule in this

21

country until potentially now.

22

The -- the rule that

The states and the federal government

23

have never had to be concerned about who goes

24

first.

25

consequences, surely there are practical

Under the law of unintended

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12
13

Thank you,

MR. CHAITEN:

I just -- I guess I will

pick up where -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

I will pick up where he ended, which

15

is that this has never been the rule in the

16

country -- in this country today.

It's the

17

rule in at least 20 -- 20 states.

It's the

18

rule in 37 states with respect to certain

19

crimes.

20

okay.

21

And it also seems to have worked out

I did want to -- I did want to return

22

to the issue of stare decisis and respond to

framework for answering stare decisis

25

questions.

We -- we have a legal

It's a law of stare decisis.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
87

And I think it provides some pretty

2

standard guidance on this.

3

right on the merits, that's true, but if we're

4

right, if we're assuming we're right on the

5

merits, then -- then the question is what else

6

do we need to show?

7

We -- we have to be

And I already told you about one key

8

factor under this Court's jurisprudence, which

9

is a jurisprudence -- jurisprudential change.

10

And I think incorporation is a pretty

11

significant one.

12

Second, we -- there has been a -- a

13

massive expansion in federal law as this Court

has recognized.

And, of course, reliance isn't really a

relevant issue where you're talking about an

21

unconstitutional law enforcement practice.

23

constitutional case.

It is not a statutory

24

case.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think there is

4

less reliance here than there was on the issue

5

of the Miranda rule?

6

MR. CHAITEN:

Well, the issue is

7

whether -- whether you are continuing an

8

unconstitutional law enforcement practice.

9

my point is the Court has pointed out in

10

Arizona v. Gant that the Court has never

11

allowed continuation of an unconstitutional law

enforcement practice -­

constitutional decision of this Court that

imposes any limitation on any right in the Bill

18

of Rights that affects criminal procedure is

19

always open to reexamination without

20

consideration of stare decisis because doing

21

that would expand the rights of the criminal

22

defendant?

23

That's your position?

MR. CHAITEN:

Your Honor, I'm not

24

saying without consideration of stare decisis.

25

I am saying without consideration of reliance

interests.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. CHAITEN:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reliance -­

This Court has said -­
I mean, the obvious

5

thing that comes into my mind, I got the other

6

factors, but the -- the -- the -- it seems -­

7

what's wrong with what I'm thinking, which must

8

be something wrong with it, that very often

9

this Court has said the rule of Constitution is

10

X, but we're not going to apply it

11

retroactively, because to do that would mean a

12

vast release of prisoners who have committed

13

crimes.

14

Now, that sounds like reliance and

15

sounds like reliance on a law that the Court

16

has said is unconstitutional, which is the

17

preceding situation.

18

MR. CHAITEN:

Yeah, I don't think it's

20

merits question.

you still apply the unconstitutional law to all

3

prison.

5

MR. CHAITEN:

Well -- - well, I think

6

the reason you don't apply it is because the

7

judgment is final, but -- so I think it is a

8

separate question from the underlying merits

question, the underlying constitutional

10

question.

11

And, incidentally, I don't think this

rule would be retroactive.

15

a concern here.

It's a procedural

It doesn't go to substantive.

It's not

So I -- I don't think that's

16

And then -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there have been

18

many decisions of this Court that have imposed

19

some limits on -- have rejected some claims

20

that have been asserted under the Fourth

21

Amendment, under the Fifth Amendment right

22

against self-incrimination, under the Sixth

23

Amendment jury trial right and the right to

24

ineffective assistance of counsel, under the

25

Eighth Amendment, right against cruel and

unusual punishment.

2

And if any of those was challenged,

3

you would say there's no -- there can never be

a reliance, and because there's a -- there

never can be reliance because it's a -- it

decisis aside?
