ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Petitioners had no duty to warn about

12

asbestos added to their equipment years or even

13

decades after its sale.

14

well-established tort law principle:

15

manufacturers are not liable for injuries

16

caused by third-party goods.

That follows from a

That tort law principle -­

it is.

23

doesn't that make a difference?

First, the -- the Respondent -- the

2

Petitioners, of course, knew that the Navy was

3

going to use asbestos because the Navy

4

determined that asbestos met its

5

specifications.

6

Petitioners' products were useless without

7

asbestos.

8

without asbestos on Navy ships.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't mean that the

Today, those same products are used

Why is that?

10

Did they discover something new that's better

11

than asbestos?

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

They did, in fact.

13

Technology advanced and there were different

14

forms of insulation, and the Navy eventually

15

transitioned to those forms.

24

it.

MR. DVORETZKY:

But at least at the

So they

So it's somewhat incongruous for me to

20

because of what you did to it, meaning your

21

product did to it.

22

It's not standing alone.

23

The asbestos is in this shape

It's an integrated product.

MR. DVORETZKY:

Two responses to that,

24

Justice Sotomayor.

First, our product does not

25

cause the asbestos to degrade in any unique

way.

This is just what happens to asbestos

2

when it's used, just as gasoline is used in a

3

car and eventually needs to be replaced.

4

our product is not contributing to the harm in

5

any way that is different than what otherwise

6

happens to asbestos.

7

Second, even if you think -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

But

In -- in normal

tort law, if you create a car that has a spark

10

in the tank, and the gasoline, which is what

11

explodes the car, explodes, the consumer is not

12

going to sue the gasoline company.

13

to sue you because you, the car manufacturer,

14

produced a defective product that caused an

15

injury that the gasoline would otherwise not

16

cause.

17
18

It's going

Why are you any different than the
bare-metal car seller?

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because, in that

20

situation, the consumer might well sue both the

21

car manufacturer and the gasoline manufacturer

22

because both products contributed together to

23

the harm, where -- whereas in -­

I mean, normally -- you normally run a car with

gasoline and it's normally perfectly safe.

5

Here, you normally run your product with

6

asbestos and it's not perfectly safe.

7

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, here, you run

8

our product and our product is safe.

9

asbestos that is causing the harm.

It's the
Now the

10

asbestos naturally degrades with use, and then

11

replacing it can be dangerous.

That's true.

12

But, unlike the defective car, which

13

is creating a spark that a properly operating

14

car should not create, and thereby causing the

15

injury with the gasoline, our equipment is not

16

making the asbestos any more dangerous than it

17

would be.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

But if -- are you arguing that this is a

22

special rule in admiralty, or are you arguing

23

that this is the normal tort rule?

25

MR. DVORETZKY:

If -- if -­

The other -­
I'm sorry.

We're arguing that

it's the normal tort rule that ought to be

2

As a matter of ordinary tort law, product

3

liability defendants, of course, may be liable

4

for injuries that their products cause, so the

5

defective car that causes a spark is causing an

6

injury.

injuries that are caused by third-party

products foreseeably used with their own.

But they're not liable for the

14

that situation can be sued, but the tire

manufacturer, even knowing that its tire is

16

going to be used with the dangerous wheel, is

not liable.

I -- I think you -- what do I make of

2

the fact that this is maritime law, which is

3

different, and that you claim there's a uniform

4

tort principle, but not every state has the

5

absolute rule that you tout?

6

There's a split of authorities among

7

states as to the extent of liability, if any,

8

for bare-metal providers.

9

I'm in a special area with a solicitude for

So what do I do if

10

sailors and I don't buy your argument that we

11

should ignore that principle or overturn it

12

after two centuries of case law on it?

13

Assume I accept the principle.

14

MR. DVORETZKY:

So, Justice Sotomayor,

15

I think there are a few questions embedded in

16

there.

17

Let -- let me try to tease them out.
First, in the tire case and the jet

18

case, you say it's not foreseeable.

19

contrary, the jet manufacturer makes a

20

passenger jet, of course, knowing that seats

21

are going to be used and it's common knowledge

22

that you can -- that can cause blood clots.

23

Quite the

The -- the tire manufacturer in the

24

Reynolds case that I'm referring to

25

specifically manufactured the tire to be used

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

with this particular kind of wheel that was

2

dangerous.

3

So there is foreseeability, but the

4

point is that, as a matter of ordinary tort

5

law, foreseeability alone is not enough to

6

create a duty when you're talking about the

7

foreseeable use of your product with somebody

8

else's product.

9

The second question -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -­

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

12

Well, the second question, Justice

Sorry, Justice Breyer.

13

Sotomayor, that I think you asked is about the

14

state of tort law.

15

If you look only at asbestos-specific

16

cases, then there's a split of authority.

17

there's no reason that you would look only at

18

asbestos-specific cases.

19

the body of tort law as a whole.

20

do, Respondents haven't found a single case,

21

not even one, outside of the asbestos context

of the other examples that you've given.

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

Without the

Justice Ginsburg, I

20

think that is true of the other examples.

21

Nobody would buy a commercial passenger jet

22

without the availability of seats to be

23

installed in it later by a third-party.

24
25

Nobody would buy drywall without the
availability of paint or -- or wallpaper in

order to cover it.

2

our situation is any different from the

3

ordinary tort rule.

4

And so I don't think that

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is somewhat.

I

5

mean, this is an area where I had to go back

6

and read the Restatement of Torts about 50

7

times -- not 50, but -- because this is a

8

negligence case.

9

So I -- I don't know that there are

10

special rules here.

11

convinced of that.

12

negligence case, then you look at the

13

restatement, and then you look at what the

14

court ordered below, I do have trouble with one

15

of the things.

16

At least I haven't been
So, if you look at it as a

But do you really have a problem if

17

the manufacturer specifically directed that the

18

product be used with an asbestos-containing

19

material, where he knew that it was dangerous?

20

That's one of the things they want to show.

21

I don't see what your problem is with

22

that, or, that the product was originally

23

equipped with an asbestos-containing part that

24

you could reasonably expect will be replaced,

25

because simply, when people do replace things,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

they do tend to use the kind of equipment that

2

was there before.

3

What's wrong with that one?

Now containing an -- I might -- the

4

third one, I don't know, because there's

5

conflict sort of within the restatement, so I

6

thought maybe you should phrase it in your

7

favor somewhat and say, well, he could be

8

liable to where the manufacturer functionally

9

requires, you see, he puts out a product that

10

to work, that to work, you have to use the

11

dangerous thing.

12

I'm pretty sure he should be liable

13

there, but I can see that C in the -- the court

14

of appeals may be read to go beyond that.

15

right.

16

All

It's a long question.
But, really, it comes down to what's

17

wrong with A and B, and what's wrong with C if

18

we interpret it as I suggested?

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

So let's take A, B,

20

and C.

21

and C was replacement parts.

22

I think A was required, B was directed,

The problem with required is that

you say.

The other side may say the opposite.

20

And there we looked through the record briefly,

21

I'm not an expert there, but I think we only

22

have to -- it did seem to me maybe there's some

23

evidence on their side there, and -- and I

don't think that's -- I -- I can't read the

this follows on Justice Breyer's -- when you

7

making a fairness argument?

8

9

that?

10

Are you making an

What kind of argument is

MR. DVORETZKY:

It's -- it's both a

11

doctrinal argument and a policy argument.

12

doctrinal argument, tort law draws -- draws the

13

line of liability at the chain of distribution.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

As a

says that, because -- because I can't think of

to tell me what sense would it make to say,

even though you direct the use of asbestos, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

can't be liable for its harms?

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because tort law

places the duty to warn and also places

4

liability on the party that is in the best

5

position to control or avoid the harm.

6

And it is the -- well, the subsequent

There's no question here that the Navy

3

knew about the dangers of asbestos and that,

4

over time, asbestos manufacturers knew about

5

the dangers of asbestos and, again, companies

6

came up with alternatives.

7

So the policy rationale here is to

8

place the burden on the party that has the

9

ability to control the harm, and, moreover, the

10

asbestos component manufacturers are the ones

11

that are in the best position to warn.

12

If we had put some sort of a plate on

13

our equipment, first, who knows if it would

14

have been seen down the road as opposed to the

15

package of new insulation that has to be opened

16

and applied.

17

And, second, as technology changes,

18

our warning from 1945 might well have become

19

outdated and inconsistent with a

20

state-of-the-art warning provided later.

21

And so that's why tort law puts the

22

liability on the party that actually has the

23

ability to control the harm.

you see any other downsides to expanding the

MR. DVORETZKY:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I think -­
I'm really not

5

interested in asbestos and bare metal.

I'm

talking, as Justice Kagan was, as a matter of

7

doctrine and policy.

8

downsides are there associated with expanding

9

the duty to warn, at least insofar as we're

What costs, what

necessary or inevitably used?

12

foreseeability for a moment.

13

Forget about

We -- we normally do, you're right,

14

put the duty to warn with the lowest-cost

15

avoider.

16

some cases, it has been expanded in this area,

17

it looks like, and I'm just wondering what -­

18

what are the negatives associated with that?

19

Why is that bad?

20

But sometimes it's expanded and, in

MR. DVORETZKY:

So, again, outside the

21

asbestos context, I don't think it has been.

22

But, to answer your -- your policy question,

23

it's bad, first, because, if you believe that

24

the incentive ought to be placed on the -- the

25

party that can avoid the harm, you dilute that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

-- that incentive by spreading the liability

2

around and you lead to over -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

remains.

5

the duty to warn.

6

Okay?

7

No, that incentive

I mean, that still -- we're expanding
We're not contracting it.

So that doesn't work.
MR. DVORETZKY:

You lead to

8

over-warning, which will lead people just to be

9

deluged with warnings and to ignore them.

You

10

create a situation where there really isn't any

11

clarity from manufacturers about what they do

12

or don't have to warn about, because we're

13

talking about tests like directed and required,

14

but what do those really mean?

15

If we talk about required, really,

16

what that means is it's really foreseeable, but

17

at some point, there can be another alternative

18

that maybe is 10 percent less effective and

19

10 percent more expensive.

20

At that point, is asbestos or whatever

21

product we're talking about still required, or

22

can we say, well, the equipment will run with

23

this alternative, it just won't run quite as

24

well?

25

Is -- when you put your product into

Heritage Reporting Corporation

23
1

the market and say it requires asbestos, that

2

doesn't even hold as technology changes.

3

"required" and "specified" are indeterminant

terms, and one of the costs, to answer your

question, Justice Gorsuch, is you're leaving

manufacturers at sea, whether we're talking

7

about maritime law or on land -­

change to a less dangerous product if it's

cheaper or if it's easier to deal with.

not sure what that -- why that increases cost

24

in some meaningful way.

MR. DVORETZKY:

fact at a party that didn't think that the law

warnings to have too many of them.

with inconsistent warnings.

And, again, moreover, you may end up

10

If the company -- if a company

provides a warning about how to handle

insulation based on what's known in 1945, that

We're

You can sue the asbestos

9

But the -- the problem is, if you have

10

multiple warnings, it dilutes the value of them

11

and it can also lead to contradictory warnings.

12

equipment that provides instructions about what

to do in 1945 based on the state of insulation

comes on the market, that may have to be

Does a manufacturer of a device that

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Section 388 of the Second Restatement.

That's

7

where the principle is embodied, and that says

8

something that ought to be uncontroversial, and

9

that is, if you make a product and the ordinary

10

use or maintenance of that product is going to

11

cause a harm that you know about, then you need

12

to warn about that.

13

And the court of appeals here quite

14

explicitly limited its holding to situations in

15

which you have a product that has a part and

that part is required for it to operate.

13

and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -­

it there over time, it will degrade to the

16

point that, when you have ordinary maintenance,

18

machine, and you are digging it out and

19

chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust.

There's a pretty good illustration of

that, and that's their own concession that when

they ship the machine with the original gasket

the duty to warn is taken on by the

into dust.

in that circumstance.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But a foreseeability

11

analysis might be a 10 or a 30 percent, we can

12

quibble, okay, but some chance.

13

Then there is in the case law a

14

suggestion of inevitability, okay, certitude,

15

we know it's going to be used.

16

And then there is the third possible

17

rule, which seems to be the traditional

18

products liability rule, which is you warn for

19

your own thing and not for someone else's,

20

okay?

21

Those are the three choices between us.
And I think we've been aligning the

22

first two a little bit here in this discussion.

23

And I'm just curious, which is it that you are

24

asking this Court to adopt?

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is the -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And why?
Okay.

It's the

3

second, because that's the actual rule of the

4

Third Circuit.

5

with the opinion.

That's actually why I started
So the -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.
-- what the court of

8

appeals did is it said the common law

9

recognizes reasonable foreseeability.

And my

10

friend likes reasonable foreseeability, despite

11

all the complaints about it.

12

So take the original gasket in the

13

machine.

14

course, for reasonably foreseeable disease from

15

the original gasket.

16

said is we are going to adopt the common law

17

rule that you have a duty to warn about your

18

own machine, and that's going to include parts

19

and replacement parts that must be there, that

20

are required and the machine will not operate

21

without them.

22

He wants to be held liable only, of

What the Third Circuit

Then you are responsible for the

23

reasonably foreseeable harm that comes from

24

that.

25

for replacement parts that are reasonably

It did not say that you are responsible

foreseeable to be used with your machine.

2

And so -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm not talking

4

about the replacement parts portion of the

5

opinion right now.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

Yes.
I'm just talking

about the bare-metal portion of the opinion.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.
Put aside the

11

replacement parts.

12

three possibilities before us.

13

still -- you're saying the second one is the

14

one you'd have us adopt?

15

I think we're -- we have

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And you're

And that is it is

16

inevitable.

17

disagree, respectfully, with your understanding

18

that the ordinary rule is that you're

19

responsible only for the thing that you, you

20

know, you make alone without regard to

21

replacement parts.

22

So I do want to say that I do

And my friend, I think, is just

23

confused.

He says we haven't cited any cases.

24

We've cited the Huynh case, for example, and

25

that's a situation in which you have an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

asbestos grinder and you have a wheel on it and

2

the wheel runs out, and you replace it with an

3

identical wheel, and there is a risk that the

4

wheel will explode.

5

Of course, your duty to warn that,

6

hey, my machine, you know, it tends to blow up

7

the wheel is -- remains your duty even if you

8

replace the wheel.

9

We also have the Macias case.

So the

10

first one was from the California court of

11

appeals.

12

Washington supreme court.

13

case.

14

The Macias case is from the
That's a respirators

So you make a respirator and it

15

exposes people to the thing that -- benzene or

16

asbestos or whatever it is that you're trying

17

to protect against.

18

that you know that that machine -- that device

19

is only going to operate when it is that it's

20

exposed to the hazardous chemical.

21

exists just as in the gasoline in the car.

22

You have a duty to warn

JUSTICE BREYER:

That duty

But let's -- can I go

23

back for a second?

Because now I -- I did have

24

this kind of question.

25

the court of appeals' opinion, and it says the

I suddenly went back to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

-- the product may be held liable -- you know,

2

the manufacturer, if the facts show the

3

plaintiff's injuries were a reasonably

4

foreseeable result of the failure to provide a

5

warning.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9
10

Yes.
Then it gives three

examples.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Well, I don't have

11

any problem -- or I probably don't have a

12

problem with the three examples.

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Yes.
But it doesn't say

they're exclusive.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh.
And so I think

18

perhaps one of the other things that the other

19

side is worried about is, if you read that

20

sentence without limiting it to the three

21

examples, it would create the horribles that

22

they show -- that they agree with.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I understand.
Yes.
And I think you can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

take some comfort from my reading from the

2

first operative sentence of the court of

3

appeals' opinion that it's talking about only

4

parts that have to be there for the machine to

5

operate.

6

When the court of appeals -- and this

7

is going to be at 16A of the Petition Appendix

8

-- says we've given you three, we're not saying

9

these are, you know, all of the possible

10

examples.

I just think it was being sensible

11

in a very common law way.

12

excluding -­

But it was

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But where we -­

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If I could just be

15

precise about one thing it was excluding, and

16

it didn't, and so you would know what the

17

actual consequences of this are.

18

There is a leading district court

19

opinion that gets cited here by the court of

20

appeals, and it had a fourth, and that is

21

knowledge.

22

asbestos part will be in it, but you didn't

23

require it, and it wasn't absolutely necessary

24

for the machine to work -- and the court of

25

appeals, I think, was avoiding passing on that

If you know that the part, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

question, which isn't in the case, and I think

2

you fairly can too.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the horribles

4

that Mr. Dvoretzky threw out at the end of his

5

argument was like a flashlight with batteries.

6

What -- how should that come out?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If the flashlight is

8

designed in a way that it punctures the

9

battery, okay, in the same way that maintaining

10

this machine causes the asbestos to turn into

11

dust -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, you just put the

13

batteries in, a normal flashlight, but it

14

doesn't work.

15

work, unless the batteries are in there.

16

You can turn it on, it doesn't

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, I think that, in

17

that situation, the mere fact that batteries

18

are intrinsically dangerous doesn't create the

19

duty to warn.

20

feature of this case that the machine itself

21

contributes to the liability.

22

very frequently, asbestos gaskets and other

23

material, and it cannot operate without it.

24

It's the combination of those things.

25

It is, I think, a special

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It ships with,

Well, I guess I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

confused then, because I -- I haven't used a

2

flashlight without a battery very often.

3

mean, you know, it seems inevitable.

4

example that we're given is the manufacturer of

5

the ashtray -­

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I

The other

Yeah.
-- who inevitably

8

knows that it's going to be used with some sort

9

of tobacco product, hopefully.

And extending

10

the duty to warn in those cases, some of the

11

concerns that your colleague has raised about

12

over-warnings, contradictory warnings, and the

13

costs associated with that, that might deter

14

innovation and raise consumer cost needlessly,

15

seem to have some purchase to me.

16

So help me out.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

where Justice Kagan is.

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sure.

Okay.

I'm -- I'm stuck

Okay.

I think their

21

better example is flashlights, rather than

22

ashtrays, because you can use ashtrays for

23

other things.

24

harder hypothetical.

25

So I don't want to avoid the

And that is, if you have a -- a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

flashlight and you know as the manufacturer

2

that the batteries in them are going to leak

3

out and put acid on your hands, I actually do

4

think on reflection that that manufacturer

5

needs to warn about that.

6

Right?

So it -- it is technically the case

7

that the battery inside is leaking, but you're

8

operating a flashlight and you're going to be

9

exposed to that risk.

I would think that you

10

would want the manufacturer of the light to

11

warn people while you're holding this

12

flashlight you could be exposed to acid.

13

Now you may have -­

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

15

So you just

changed the answer.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I did.

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So -­
Just making sure.

Absolutely.

Now I -­

22

I will say that another part of my answer is

23

that this is the easier case because the

24

product can -- actually contributes to the

25

injury.

You may have lots of defenses there,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

including that there were other warnings that

2

were already given, you have a sophisticated

3

user that already knows about it, that sort of

thing.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you show me a

23

case that would have suggested -­

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

Sure.

There are two.

The two that -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that would have

2

come out to the -- to that conclusion?

3

always assume that when manufacturers do

4

things, it's because somebody sued them.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Somebody told them to.

7

And sometimes they are over-protective.

8

true.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I

It's

Occasionally.

So I -- the two I

11

think that are -- are quite on point are the

12

Huynh case and the Macias case that I gave, so

13

the California Court of Appeals and the

14

Washington Supreme Court.

15

And I -- I do think I should, you

16

know, to be fair to my friend, address the

17

other examples.

18

okay?

19

And so he gives the airplane,

So you -- you manufacture an airplane.

20

It is -- a few things about that.

First,

21

airplanes actually do work without seats.

22

know, some -- if not, somebody better tell

23

FedEx, which is shipping things all over the

24

country.

25

lots of different kinds of seats.

You

But at the very least, they work with
That's why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

some people fly Emirates and not Spirit,

2

because some of the seats will be much, much

3

closer in and have a much greater risk of

4

injury for them.

5

And that's why we don't say, as the

6

court of appeals did here, that the airplane

7

will only work in a situation in which you are

8

going to be exposed to it.

9

But I'll give you another airplane

10

hypothetical that I would hope come out this

11

way, and that is the airplane manufacturer

12

attaches Rolls Royce engines.

13

working on the engine can expose you to

14

terrible shock and being killed or gasoline

15

will poor out of it or oil will pull out -­

16

pour out of it.

You know that

17

I hope that they -- we want the

18

airplane manufacturer to warn about that

19

because that -- that plane will not operate

20

without those engines and you are going to be

21

exposed to that risk in the course of

22

maintaining that machine.

23
24
25

That's the much more analogous
hypothetical of ours.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What about the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

ashtray?

2

You didn't answer the question.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I had

3

said that the ashtray could be used for a lot

4

of different things.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's -- I mean,

6

that's -- your answer is, well, you know, the

7

manufacturer of the ashtray is off the hook

8

because it's possible somebody might use it for

9

some purpose other than -- than smoking?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, I -- I just tried

11

to give -- among the distinctions is certainly

12

that.

13

Circuit's -­

14
15
16

And so it wouldn't fit within the Third

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if I don't think

that's much of a distinction?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

Then there are

17

-- there are others, and that is the ashtray

18

does not give you cancer.

19

does not actually contribute to your injury.

20

Okay?

The ashtray

What you have is you have a toxic

21

product that you're making a choice to use that

22

you are putting down.

23

this -- and I think it's a great example for us

24

because it highlights why we are not saying

25

they're responsible for every harm from

It would be like saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

like us saying:

3

4

because the storage room had the asbestos in

it.

It would be

causation that there was a relationship between

You can put your cancer-causing

10

for it, but if it is the case -- I'll give you

11

an example.

12

What if the ashtray is made of paper?

13

Okay?

14

if you put something lit in it, they will cause

15

-- it will cause combustion and it will burn -­

16

If the ashtray is made of paper, so that

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but that's

17

different because then your product, the actual

18

product that you're manufacturing, is

19

dangerous.

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Your -- Your

Honor, none of this is about the product -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The difference -­

the difference -­
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It may not be as good

as my gasket.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Just so I can

12

follow, the difference between the flashlight

13

and ashtray example?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The -- the difference

15

between the flashlight and the ashtray example

16

is that in the course -- in the necessary

17

course of using it, if you are going to be

18

exposed to harm.

19

axis, it is the case that the ashtray can be

20

used for other things.

21

And so I suppose on that

But we are -- I did think that it was

22

quite important that we aren't saying that they

23

are -- they have a duty to warn that kind of

24

encompasses everything that the asbestos

25

manufacturer would, because the asbestos

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

manufacturer may have other warnings and other

2

harm that it causes.

3

Our harm is one that comes distinctly

from the fact that this machine is just -- it's

not bare-metal; it's dead metal.

sitting there as dead weight.

It is just

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The -- the

ashtray, a jury will find in my hypothetical

case that the particular nature of its design

meant that the manufacturer knew it would be

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.
That's my question.
The ashtray -- I think

16

that there is not a duty.

17

important distinctions are that, here, the

18

actual machine creates the special and distinct

19

risk, and, in addition, there is in the common

20

law this understanding about whether you would

21

be an efficient party or there's a much better

22

party to warn.

23

I think that the

And there we have obviously the

24

situation -- I think the -- the hypothetical

25

resonates because there's so much knowledge in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56

the community about the harms from cigarettes

2

that come from warning about cigarettes.

3

But, you know, to take the battery

example from the flashlights, there are other

5

sensible instances in which we say:

6

using the machine is going to expose you to a

7

distinct risk, or at the very least, when using

the machine is going to create the risk, what

is it that we think the actual -- you know, the

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, if the question

17

is who is the -- the best party to warn, in

18

this case, why isn't that the Navy?

19

the Navy isn't liable because of the separate

20

doctrine, but why isn't the Navy -- why wasn't

21

the Navy the best party to -- to warn?

22

Now I know

The Navy was aware of the hazards long

23

before the ships were built.

It wanted to use

24

asbestos.

25

that they would have to have asbestos on it.

It ordered these products knowing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1
2

It had control of the sailors.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

So what the

3

Navy did -- and so I -- it is a very specific

4

question about the Navy -- what the Navy did is

5

it required the manufacturers to provide

6

manuals on how the machines are maintained.

7

said to the manufacturer:

8

maintain your machine.

9

You know how to

The Navy isn't the party that's most

10

expert about that.

11

tested the machine and the like.

12

were specifications that it had to meet, but

13

the party that would produce the manual, the

14

party that would know that this was going to

15

degrade, the party that -- that -- and if I

16

could just give you another precise example

17

because I'm not sure the briefs, you know,

18

elucidate this enough.

19

It

It's not the one that
Yes, there

What happens here is you have two

20

pieces of metal -- that's why it's called the

21

bare-metal defense -- and in between them is a

22

gasket, just like a washer in something in your

23

house, okay?

24
25

This thing cannot operate unless it's
sealed with something that has a little bit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

more flexibility to it, and that's why you have

2

a gasket and that's why -- the reason it's

3

asbestos is it's the only thing in the relevant

4

period of time that would work.

5

And so, in that situation when you,

6

the manufacturer, are designing your machine

7

and knowing what kind of gasket will I be able

8

to use, it's going to have to be an asbestos

9

one, but not just that, I know that when you

10

break the machine open, right, to do

11

maintenance on the machine, we have to get

12

inside it, I know you're going to have to

13

scrape that off and make it perfectly clean in

14

order to reseal it, given the tolerances of my

15

machine.

I want to make

21

sure I understand it.

The engine can cause all

22

sorts of dangers when it's running.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

theory was that the plane manufacturer is

And your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

liable to the -- when those dangers injure

2

someone?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Your Honor, what I was

4

-- the example I was giving is if you are doing

5

maintenance on the engine, okay, under the

6

integrated product doctrine, the responsibility

7

there is of the airline manufacturer.

8
9

It may provide another manual from the
Rolls Royce company, but if the airline is

10

providing a manual on how to maintain the

11

machine and it includes the engines, we want it

12

to warn about the dangers of -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

thought in that case -- it's a point your

15

friend on the other side made -- it does seem

16

to me that it would make a lot more sense for

17

the engine manufacturer to be the one giving

18

warnings about how its product works.

19

I would have

Now I'm not quite sure why that's

20

different than the case before us, but it does

21

strike me as -- as a different situation.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I do think that

23

the -- the way the integrated product doctrine

24

has worked, and I think we can also cut through

25

the ambiguities and what the marginal cases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

are, because they concede liability as to the

2

gaskets that shipped with it originally.

3

So we know we're dealing with an

4

integrated product there.

5

product doctrine works as saying if you build

6

something into your machine and it is going to

7

operate as intended, it is the manufacturer of

8

the integrated product, the turbine, the pump,

9

in our examples, that has the -- the common law

10

The integrated

duty to warn.

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Is the -- is a

12

flashlight an integrated product then with the

13

batteries?

14
15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18
19

I -- I think it's

probably -­

16
17

Is it -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Or what's the

theory?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I -- I think it is

because we're talking about wear parts here -­

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

21

not an integrated product with the -­

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And the ashtray is

With the -­
-- tobacco?

Exactly.
Is that the -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

just want to make sure -- is that the

2

distinction, so I understand?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is among the

4

distinctions, that's right.

5

would be probably whether it is the case that

6

these things ordinarily ship with batteries.

7

Okay?

8
9

And part of it

If it's the case that these products
come with batteries, so, you know, they're

10

perceived as being one integrated thing.

11

they are instead understood to be two separate

12

things, it would be a different matter.

13

If

The easy case, I would say -- we -­

14

we're having the struggle that the common law

15

has had.

16
17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So shipped with,

not inevitably used with?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.

I think that it

19

is shipped with because it is inevitably used

20

with.

21

like we love asbestos.

22

nothing else -­

It's no accident.

23

It just -- it wasn't
I mean, there is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but here

24

-- here, they -- they didn't ship the asbestos

25

with it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

your gasket part.

4

added later.

5

That is -­
Other than

I mean, the insulation was

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is -- so just to

6

be clear, our -- our case rests quite heavily

7

on the internal gasket that turns to dust and

8

the internal packing that turns to dust.

9

was overwhelmingly provided with the machine

That

10

because, especially as to the gaskets, you

11

know, the metal will just rub up against it.

12

There is the question of the

13

non-replacement external insulation.

And so

14

this could be looked at differently.

We do

15

think the result is the same, because the

16

machine will not operate as intended without

17

the external insulation for two reasons.

18

The most important one is the machine

19

is built to keep heat in the system.

20

don't have asbestos insulation, all the heat

21

goes out of it.

22

will be covered in insulation.

23

If you

Everybody knows the machine

The reason it doesn't ship with it is

24

because it is just very, very difficult to

25

pre-install blanket insulation rather than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

hanging it on once it gets to the ship itself.

2

I -- I will say there is also a

3

marginal case that my friend sometimes points

4

to, and that is you ship the parts of the

5

machine and there's where you put in the gasket

6

and the packing.

7

That's because some -- these machines

8

can be so big that the Navy can require that

9

they be assembled shipboard, but that doesn't

10

make them any less part of the original

11

machine.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

The part there that I

13

started off, whatever my track was, is -- is in

14

the restatement where it says on -- you're

15

talking about this case that you're talking

16

about, I think, right now.

17

"The law itself must take care to

18

avoid requiring excessive precautions of actors

19

relating to harms that are immediately due to

20

the improper conduct of third-parties, even

21

when that improper conduct can be regarded as

22

somewhat foreseeable."

23

So that says, oh, well, we have to

24

figure it out.

And that's why I sort of see,

25

but I thought, well, maybe that should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

interpreted as to require, in your third

2

situation, not the first two, that -- that the

3

manufacturer functionally requires that a

4

dangerous item be put to work.

5
6
7
8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

All right.

The only

change I would give -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

And you all can argue

about whether that's true.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sorry.

I might not

10

say the manufacturer functionally requires,

11

that is, it is functionally required.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What would you say?
It is -- in the

14

passive voice, because I just -- if they are

15

making a machine to a Navy specification and

16

the machine will only operate with asbestos, I

17

don't think that gets rid of the duty to warn

18

unless the Navy tells them not to warn.

19

the Boyle defense.

20

That's

So I do want to be clear that I think

21

that there are a couple defenses, government

22

contractor and superseding cause, that

23

essentially the other side's argument is, you

24

know, we got halfway there, you know, we didn't

25

actually have the Navy forbidding us from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

giving warnings and we didn't actually have an

2

unforeseeable superseding cause, but kind of

3

the mix of those as a policy matter is enough

4

to put the liability off on someone else.

5

There should be a real consequence to

6

the fact that they can't meet the standards of

7

the Court's decision in Exxon versus Sofec on

8

superseding cause or the government contractor

9

defense.

10

When those requirements aren't met,

11

that's because we want the liability on the

12

original party here.

13

It is creating the danger.

And that's this party.

14

Thank you.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

Thank you,

counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20
21
22

MR. DVORETZKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I think that one of the challenges -­

23

one of the challenges of this argument is

24

creating an administrable rule based on these

25

terms like required, directed, inevitable.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

And I think the back and forth shows

2

that those terms, when you actually try to

3

apply them, are very difficult to apply and

4

will not lead to predictable rules that will

5

tell manufacturers what they need to do and

6

that will promote the interests of maritime

7

commerce.

8
9

When you talk about the machine not
operating without it, in our case, the machines

10

would operate without asbestos.

11

would not operate as efficiently.

12

They just

And Joint Appendix 104 and 128 discuss

13

a couple of alternatives that maybe did not

14

meet the Navy's specs but that would have

15

allowed the machines to operate, and, again,

16

they operate without asbestos today.

17

If we're talking about directed, I

18

think it's helpful to look at what an example

19

of a manual in this case actually is, and it's

20

in the Third Circuit Joint Appendix at 372 to

21

404.

22

All it is is a series of sketches that

23

show where the asbestos would go.

In other

24

words, this shows the foreseeable use of

25

asbestos by the Navy, but it's not providing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

specific step-by-step directions saying you

2

must use asbestos and here's how to use it.

3

So, when we talk about directed, what

4

does that mean?

5

law in particular to have predictable rules in

6

order to promote maritime commerce.

7

And it's important in maritime

Second point:

My friend talks about

8

how our machines created the risk.

This is not

9

a combined use sort of case where a flashlight

10

might puncture a battery.

And in that

11

situation, of course, the flashlight

12

manufacturer would be liable for contributing

13

to the harm.

14

It was not argued below.

15

evidence in the record that our -- that our

16

machines contribute to the harm in this way.

17

And it's also not true, first, because of the

18

point I made earlier that this is just the

19

natural degradation of asbestos when it's used,

20

not any unique harm caused by our machine.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's no

And what you just

22

said, it sounds to me like -- that those would

23

be an issue -- issues for trial, but you say

24

you should have summary judgment and no trial

25

based on the, what is it, the bare something

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

doctrine?

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, if -- if the

3

theory -- if it were argued in this case that

4

there was a genuine issue of fact about whether

5

our equipment contributed to the harm in the

6

way that a flashlight punctures a battery, that

7

might well be a fact question, but that's not

8

been pled or argued, and there's no genuine

9

issue of fact on this record because that's

10

simply not what's been argued below.

11

Moreover, if you look at our system,

12

while the system as a whole generates heat, not

13

all equipment in the system even does that.

14

The -- the turbine, for example, spins around

15

but isn't generating any appreciable amount of

16

heat.

17

And so the idea that every

18

manufacturer in this integrated system is

19

liable for warning would just -- would, again,

20

lead to over-warning and excessive liability.

21

With respect to the cases that Mr.

22

Goldstein cited, the Huynh case is one in which

23

the grinder caused the wheel to explode because

24

the particular wheel was incompatible with the

25

grinder.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

And so, in that situation, there, of

2

course, might well be a duty on the part of the

3

grinder manufacturer to say:

4

wheel.

5

Don't use this

The Macias case did not involve later

6

added components.

7

court there reaffirmed its earlier decisions in

8

the Braaten and Simonetta cases, which did

9

involve later added components.

10

And the same state supreme

And it's also worth emphasizing that

11

both of those cases -- both of those cases are

12

asbestos-related cases.

13

hasn't cited a single case from outside the

14

asbestos made context involving, say, a

15

flashlight manufacturer that needs to warn

16

about the batteries.

17

And Mr. Goldstein

The fact that flashlight manufacturers

18

might do that as a matter of being overly

19

cautious doesn't mean that the law requires it

20

and doesn't mean that tort law policy is well

21

served by it.

22
