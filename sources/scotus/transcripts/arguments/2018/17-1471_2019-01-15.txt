CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Home Depot versus Jackson.

6

Mr. Barnette.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARNETTE

8

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Home Depot is a defendant under any

12

reasonable construction of that term and, in

13

fact, that's our only role in this case.

14

just a defendant.

15

We're

Home Depot is not a counterclaim

16

defendant.

17

Home Depot is not a third-party defendant.

18

We're not being sued for indemnity or

19

contribution.

20

We didn't sue anyone in this case.

Home Depot is simply a defendant, the

21

original defendant, to a consumer fraud class

22

action filed in state court by Mr. Jackson.

23

such, we're within the plain terms of

24

Section 1441(a), are entitled to remove this

25

class action under the Class Action Fairness

Heritage Reporting Corporation

As

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

Act to federal court, and the Fourth Circuit

2

erred in holding otherwise.

3

Because Home Depot is simply a

4

defendant, this Court's holding in Shamrock Oil

5

does not govern.

6

Shamrock Oil is an original plaintiff case, not

7

an original defendant case.

8

have erred in extending the holding of Shamrock

9

Oil to say that, basically, you have to be an

10

As the Court is aware,

The lower courts

original defendant to be able to remove.

11

The plain text of Section 1441(a) --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not quite

13

sure, putting this outside the class action

14

setting, generally, all defendants have to

15

agree to removal and with some other

16

limitations.

17

If you're now an additional defendant

18

to the action, why do you -- why don't you need

19

Jackson's approval to remove?

20

approving because he's opposing you.

21

MR. BARNETTE:

And he's not

I don't expect he

22

would, Your Honor.

That's correct.

Under

23

1441(a) and traditional diversity jurisdiction,

24

1332(a), you're correct that all defendants

25

have to remove as a part of the procedure under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

1446.

2

Here, though, in Shamrock Oil, the

3

Court went through the history of removal and

4

diversity, understood that it was very

5

important to the framers that diversity

6

jurisdiction was in the original constitution,

7

Article III, Section 2.

8

original Judiciary Act of 1789, so it was

9

important to the framers that each side have

Removal was in the

10

one shot at a -- at a federal forum.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

But that's not

true.

13

MR. BARNETTE:

Presume --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All defendants

15

don't have a shot at removal.

16

everybody agrees, in an original action, all

17

defendants have to agree to removal, correct?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. BARNETTE:

Only if

That is correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So not every

defendant individually has a right to removal.
MR. BARNETTE:

Your Honor, in Shamrock

23

Oil, the Court looked at that history, looked

24

at -- basically, Congress had said plaintiffs

25

can't remove.

We know that.

Originally, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

right to removal was given to defendants only.

2

For about 20 years after the Civil War, it was

3

given to both plaintiffs and defendants.

4

then, in 1887, again, it was given back to only

5

defendants.

6

And

So this Court in Shamrock Oil --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My point still

7

remains that the statute by its own form

8

doesn't guarantee the power to every defendant

9

to remove.

10

MR. BARNETTE:

So, in Shamrock Oil,

11

the Court, Your Honor, held because of this

12

binary selection that Congress has made, you're

13

either a plaintiff or a defendant.

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how about in

a -- how about -MR. BARNETTE:

If you're the

plaintiff, then you're not the defendant.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If your theory is

19

this right of removal, how about an involuntary

20

plaintiff?

21

people can be made involuntary plaintiffs.

22

they have a right to remove?

25

Under Federal Rule 19(a)(2), some

In the same scenario, the original

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

MR. BARNETTE:

This Court in Merchant

2

Heat & Light said you step into the role of the

3

plaintiff.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, counsel, if I

5

understand your answer to Justice Sotomayor,

6

it's that counterclaim defendants count as

7

defendants for purposes of 1441, but plaintiffs

8

don't, even though they -- counterclaim

9

defendant -- plaintiffs don't, even though

10

they're the original defendant.

11

MR. BARNETTE:

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It -- it -Now how can it be

13

that the word "defendant" expands and contracts

14

like that?

15

that everybody who's a defendant in any claim

16

in the case might count as a defendant for

17

purposes of 1441, but what I can't abide or

18

understand at least is how the word "defendant"

19

could -- could be so Procrustean as to just

20

happen to fit you.

21

I -- I could understand an argument

MR. BARNETTE:

Your Honor, just to

22

briefly adjust what you said in your question,

23

if I may, we're not saying counterclaim

24

defendants.

25

solely defendants.

We're saying the parties that are
A counterclaim defendant

1

that's an original plaintiff, we're -- we don't

2

say has the right to remove under Shamrock Oil.

3

We take the Court's holding there as a given.

4

But we're not within that holding.

5

We're saying, if you're solely a defendant,

6

that's your only role.

7

Congress has established, you're either a

8

plaintiff or a defendant.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

On the binary choice

But -- but -- but

that doesn't --

11

MR. BARNETTE:

If you're not a

12

plaintiff of any sort, you have to be a

13

defendant.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, that still

15

just -- I got it, but that doesn't answer the

16

question, though, all right?

17

that the plaintiff here is no longer -- doesn't

18

qualify as a defendant --

19

MR. BARNETTE:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're saying

Correct.
-- even though the

21

plaintiff in this claim was the original

22

defendant.

23

they're not a defendant too for purposes of

24

1441?

25

How could that be?

MR. BARNETTE:

How come

Again, because, as this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

Court said in Merchant Heats & -- Merchants

2

Heat & Light, excuse me, once you file that

3

additional claim, third-party claim, you then

4

-- that original defendant steps into the role

5

of plaintiff.

6

And just like any other plaintiff,

7

like the original plaintiff, like this

8

defendant-plaintiff, those parties just go

9

along with the removal.

Plaintiffs don't

10

consent to the removal, as the justice pointed

11

out.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does your theory

13

fall apart if we don't accept your

14

claim-by-claim analysis?

15

claim by claim.

16

-- you can do that since the statute speaks

17

about a civil action and it talks about removal

18

of an action, not a removal of a claim.

You approach this

I'm not quite sure how we can

19

But, assuming we don't accept your

20

theory that removal's claim by claim, where

21

does that leave you?

22

MR. BARNETTE:

Your Honor, you're

23

correct, 1441 and 1453 talk about -- I'm sorry,

24

1332 talk about removing the civil action --

25

and 1446 -- but the point here is this Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11

held very clearly in Exxon -- Exxon versus

2

Allapattah you have to look at the claims

3

within the civil action to determine

It's not the civil

13

-- and once one -- one --

14

It's

You have to look at the claim to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So once

The removal -- the

15

removal statutes say you look at the cost --

16

you look at the action, not the claim.

17

MR. BARNETTE:

Well, 1446(b) says that

18

once there's a claim that establishes

19

jurisdiction, that's when you have 30 days to

20

remove.

21

civil action is just --

That -- the claim is key here.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BARNETTE:

But it's so --

-- the overarching

matter or lawsuit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

right that you don't have normally.

that's not based on original jurisdiction,

If you

You were never entitled to a federal

Your Honor, this case

is a qualifying class action under CAFA that,

10

by definition, is within the original

jurisdiction of the district courts.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

We --

Now you're

13

looking at the overall claim.

14

saying to us look at the claim that makes you a

15

defendant.

MR. BARNETTE:

18

19
20

You're not

The claim we removed is

We weren't in the case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that is

true, but --

21

MR. BARNETTE:

So we're not a

22

counterclaim defendant, if I could point that

23

out.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, under your

theory, if there's a counterclaim defendant and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

it's not filing an original action, you could

2

still remove?

3
4

MR. BARNETTE:

I'm sorry, could you

repeat that, Your Honor?

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it -- if you're

6

looking at the claim, if you're a counterclaim

7

defendant, are you looking at the original

8

action or are you looking at your action or

9

your --

10

MR. BARNETTE:

We're looking at the

11

claim that's being removed.

12

clear, we are not a counterclaim defendant.

13

Rule 13 is specific on what counterclaims are.

14

That's a -- a claim a party has against an

15

opposing party.

16

But, just to be

We were not in that original case.

17

That's absolutely correct.

18

say only the original defendant can remove.

19

does not say only claims brought by the

20

original plaintiff can be removed.

21

say only claims by the original plaintiff

22

against the original defendant can be removed.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But 1441 does not
It

It doesn't

But, Mr. Barnette, as

24

-- as Justice Sotomayor was saying, 1441(a),

25

which is the principal removal statute, says

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

that a civil action, not claims, but a civil

2

action can be removed where the district courts

3

have original jurisdiction.

4

And what I've always taken that to

5

mean is that to look for original jurisdiction,

6

you look to the plaintiff's complaint, the

7

original plaintiff.

8

jurisdiction.

9

complaint doesn't have any claims that belong

It gives you original

So, there, the plaintiff's

10

in federal court.

11

authority to remove under 1441(a)?

12

So where do you get the

MR. BARNETTE:

Again, Your Honor, this

13

class action qualifies under CAFA, which

14

establishes that it's within the original

15

jurisdiction of the district courts.

16

--

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I could

Well, your claim might

18

be under the original jurisdiction of the

19

district courts if it had -- or not your claim

20

but the claim to which you are defendant, if

21

that had started the lawsuit.

22

But that didn't start the lawsuit.

23

The lawsuit, the civil action, was started by a

24

claim that's completely non-federal in nature.

25

And you look to the original claim to decide

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

whether the courts have original jurisdiction,

2

don't you?

3

MR. BARNETTE:

Your Honor, this is a

4

somewhat unusual situation, although it's

5

becoming increasingly less unusual because

6

these class actions keep getting filed.

7

But, to your point, Mr. Jackson

8

essentially filed a new civil action in the

9

existing case.

10
11
12

Rule 3 says a civil action commences
with the filing of a complaint in court.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it might be

13

unusual, and it might be that the rules weren't

14

contemplating this situation, although I don't

15

really think that that's true, because the

16

rules contemplate very liberal joinder and of

17

all parties.

18

But, regardless, the rule is the rule.

19

And the rule says, when you try to figure out

20

removal, you look to whether the court, the

21

federal court, would have original jurisdiction

22

of the case.

23

And to do that, I mean, I have to say

24

there's only one -- one place to look to decide

25

whether original jurisdiction exists, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

that's to the plaintiff's original complaint.

2

MR. BARNETTE:

Respectfully, Your

3

Honor, I don't believe that's what the statute

4

says.

5

not what 1332(d)(2) says as far as CAFA

6

removals.

7

That's not what 1441(a) says and that's

Again, a defendant or defendant can

8

remove a civil action that's within the

9

original jurisdiction of the district courts.

10

We are squarely within that language.

11

defendant.

All we are in this case is a

12

defendant.

We're a class action defendant.

13

CAFA gives the original jurisdiction.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We are a

I mean, the question

15

is you would -- you would be right if this

16

claim started -- excuse me, if this action

17

started with the claim against you.

18

didn't start with the claim against you.

19

But it

And you're suggesting that we

20

essentially ignore all this language about

21

original jurisdiction in order to, you know,

22

get to this second claim.

23

isn't what counts under 1441.

24

under 1441 is the first claim.

25

MR. BARNETTE:

But the second claim
What counts

Your Honor, I would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

agree with that analysis if 1441(a) said only

2

claims brought by the original plaintiff or

3

only the original defendant can remove, but it

4

doesn't say that.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. BARNETTE:

7

8

9
10

All it says is original

This class action is within the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, to -- to --

I'm repeating myself, but to decide whether --

11
12

Well, it said --

MR. BARNETTE:

Sorry, I feel like I am

as well.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- original

14

jurisdiction exists, you look to the original

15

claim.

16

That's what original jurisdiction is.
MR. BARNETTE:

Well, Your Honor,

17

again, we don't think that's -- we think that's

18

an atextual reading of the statute.

19

I would also point out that the other

20

side has said the sort of unanimous view of the

21

lower courts that you can only have the

22

original defendant remove and you can't look

23

beyond that.

24
25

Actually, the Fifth and Eleventh
Circuits have allowed additional party

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

defendants, new defendants added to cases to

2

remove.

3

has not been uniformly applied throughout the

4

federal courts.

5

So the analysis you're talking about

We think it only makes sense.

I mean,

6

again, you're -- we're not in the case prior.

7

The only -- the first time we're brought in the

8

case is with a summons, and under Rule 4, the

9

summons goes to the defendant.

10

plain language.

That's the

We're not in the case otherwise.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BARNETTE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you -- are you -They can't -- sorry.
Listen, I -- there is

16

-- what I'm about to say has some flaw, and I'm

17

trying to figure out what it is because they

18

don't really make this argument, and,

19

therefore -- but -- but I -- it stopped me and

20

I wanted to see what the answer was.

21
22

All right.

A class action may be

removed, right?

23

MR. BARNETTE:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Correct.
Okay.

So we go look

to see what is a class action, and then we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

a definition in 1332 for these purposes.

It

2

says the term "class action" means any civil

3

action -- okay, this is a civil action -- filed

4

under Rule 23.

5

Well, a civil action filed under Rule

6

under Rule 23.

MR. BARNETTE:

because civil actions are usually filed by

what Mr. Jackson filed against you was not a

civil action filed under Rule 23.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

Thank you.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And if that is the

8

case, then I don't know what rules would govern

this claim that Jackson filed against you.

10

Is this some kind of class action that

11

is -- is this some sort of suit that is sort of

12

like a class action, but it's not under Rule

13

23, so none of the requirements of Rule 23

14

would apply?

15

I mean, the argument is -- it's a

16

clever argument, comes out of I don't know

where -- the argument is, no, it's not, he

didn't file a class action against you under

action, it should apply the rules that -- it

should apply the Rule 23 rules.

would just point the Court to Rule 3 of the

Mr. Barnette, under

But the case did not start with the

The civil action started

MR. BARNETTE:

Right.

4

establishes federal jurisdiction.

5

1446(b) says the

This Court in Exxon said, once you

6

have one claim within a civil action, the

7

entire civil action is removed.

8

We're saying you remove --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, but the reason

10

why claims are -- are there is that's to deal

11

with a plaintiff that's bringing three claims

12

and one of them raises a federal question and

13

two of them don't.

14

saying is that, when you're in that position,

15

the one claim that raises a federal question is

16

going to be able to get you into federal court.

17

And then all that 1446 is

So there's your claim-by-claim

18

analysis.

19

and the action is removed by determining

20

whether there's original jurisdiction, which is

21

determined by looking to the original

22

complaint.

23

But the action is what is removed,

MR. BARNETTE:

Respectfully, Your

24

Honor, that's not what 1441(a) says.

So we're

25

-- we're traveling under the plain language of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

28

that statute, the plain language of CAFA, and

2

we would say you would -- you would remove --

3

certainly would remove the entire civil action.

The fact that Mr. Jackson chose to

file a new class action proceeding in an

existing case, that -- that does not serve to

25

defeat removal.

I mean, that's what -- that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

the approach the plaintiffs are trying to take,

2

but that's not how the law operates.

3

A couple other things, Your Honor, I

4

would just mention.

The -- the cases following

5

Shamrock Oil that have held -- the lower court

6

cases that have held that only original

7

defendants can remove, those are all based on

8

the presumption against removal that this Court

9

already held in Dart Cherokee does not apply to

10

CAFA.

11

really does not appear to be well founded in

12

any -- any event.

13

And, frankly, that -- that presumption

When you look at the significance the

14

framers put on diversity jurisdiction, put on

15

removal jurisdiction, when you look at this

16

Court's cases like Exxon again, where we say --

17

where the Court said we're not going to apply

18

jurisdictional statutes too broadly but nor are

19

we going to read them too narrowly.

20

look at a case like Reyes Mata that says

21

federal courts have a virtually unflagging

22

obligation to exercise jurisdiction where it's

found.

-- about how lower courts have interpreted

things for decades now since Shamrock.

13

Basically, your argument has been

14

rejected by virtually every district court.

15

Not surprising it hasn't gone to the circuit

16

courts because you generally can't appeal a

17

remand.

18
19
20

MR. BARNETTE:

Pre-CAFA, that's

correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct.

21

So, to me, doesn't that have some force?

22

Couldn't and shouldn't I presume that, given

23

the state of the law, which was unanimity on

24

this question, why shouldn't I presume

25

Congress, in -- in creating this class action

statute, removal, and in addressing these

2

questions over the years, wouldn't have

3

understood that this was the state of the law?

4

That your position was not accepted?

5

MR. BARNETTE:

Well, again, Your

6

Honor, that's actually not an accurate state of

7

the law.

8

Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have allowed

9

additional parties, third-parties, to remove in

10

these circumstances, not class action cases but

11

traditional cases, traditional diversity cases.

12

Those cases are from the '80s and '90s.

13

As we point out in our brief, the

So, on this point about if you rule in

there haven't.

As you point out, there was not a lot

of circuit law on this pre-CAFA.

This issue, I

think tellingly, only arose post-CAFA as a way

22

to get around CAFA.

24

there were much easier ways for plaintiffs to

stay out of federal court.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. PAUL BLAND

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

Thank you,

MR. BLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if

it please the Court:

15

Since -- the original jurisdiction

16

idea has really been set forth here and Justice

17

Sotomayor correctly pointed out that the case

18

law under 1444(a) is virtually unanimous in our

19

behalf, and what my friend says is that

20

actually there's a division among the case law,

21

that the Fifth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit

22

disagree.

23

The Fifth and Eleventh Circuit cases,

24

Your Honors, are talking about a different

25

statute.

It's not 1441(a).

It's 1441(c).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

1441(c) draws the exact distinction

2

that Justice Kagan draws; in other words,

3

1441(c) talks about claims.

4

about a civil action, the single unitary civil

5

action that starts when a plaintiff files a

6

complaint.

7

1441(a) talks

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it

8

-- it -- 1446(b), which is setting forth the

9

procedures for removal, it refers to the notice

10

of removal of a civil action or proceeding.

11

MR. BLAND:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- so it

13

doesn't have to just be a civil action, does

14

it?

15

MR. BLAND:

Well --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

However you

17

want to conceptualize it, it seems to me that

18

you might conceptualize it as including what

19

would otherwise be a freestanding proceeding,

20

such as the one that -- where B sued C, but

21

then it also talks about a proceeding.

22

And even if you don't think that's a

23

civil action properly conceived, it's certainly

24

a proceeding of some kind, isn't it?

25

MR. BLAND:

Well, I -- I don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

it's a -- a proceeding is not an action over

2

which you'd have original jurisdiction under

3

1441(a), and as I understand the relationship

4

between 1441(a) and 1446, Your Honor, 1441(a)

5

is -- is the part of the removal statutes that

6

says here are the types of -- here -- here are

7

cases over which there's removal jurisdiction.

8

And then 1446 are the procedures that

9

go through -- you have to have -- everyone has

10

to agree and you have to do it within so many

11

days and this sort of thing.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

think those procedures apply to 1441(a)?

14

MR. BLAND:

Well, do you

They -- they do apply to

15

1441(a) except where they've been amended by

16

CAFA, but 1441(a) is where the grant of

17

original jurisdiction -- or where the grant of

18

jurisdiction comes from.

19

repeatedly said that if there is not original

20

jurisdiction over the claims in the -- excuse

21

me, over the plaintiff's complaint, if there's

22

not original jurisdiction over the plaintiff's

23

complaint, that you don't -- you don't meet the

24

standard -- you don't meet -- you don't qualify

25

for removal.

And this Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So that was -- that goes back to the

2

Planters' Bank case, the Union-Planters' Bank

3

case in 1894.

this out.

5

a diversity case, the Mexican National --

6

National Railroad case.

7

that -- that the original jurisdiction rule

8

doesn't apply in diversity cases.

9

wrong.

It was a central case that sets

Then it was applied the next year in

My friend has said

That's

It was applied in a diversity case

10

right after it was first enunciated by this

11

Court.

12

And the original jurisdiction rule of

13

1441(a) is where all -- all of the district

14

courts, starting in the 1950s, that were

15

looking at Shamrock Oil and then said, yes, the

16

same rule that applies in Shamrock Oil also

17

applies to third-party defendants,

18

counterclaimants, cross-claimants, what -- what

19

have you, that it doesn't turn upon the nature

20

of whatever state or federal rule, procedural

21

rule, is bringing someone in; that the

22

substantive question of is there jurisdiction

23

goes back to the original jurisdiction test.

24
25

And that's why the 1441(a) distinction
between 1441(a) and 1441(c), which relies upon

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

a claim, is so important.

2

statutes that create federal jurisdiction over

3

claims.

4

friend would have a terrific argument and we

5

would be in terrible shape if we were arguing a

6

7

There are other

My

But because we are arguing under four

8

-- because the jurisdictional test here is

9

1441(a), which has always turned on can you

10

find jurisdiction in the plaintiff's complaint,

11

it's really a different animal.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what you're

13

arguing is not based on the language, not based

14

on the term "original jurisdiction" in 1441.

15

It's based on the well-pleaded complaint rule.

16

Am I right on that?

17

MR. BLAND:

Actually, Your Honor, I

18

don't think you are right.

19

explain?

20

because I think the Court has sometimes used

21

these words to mean the same things and they

22

really don't.

23

And can I try and

I think this is sort of complicated

So the -- the original jurisdiction

24

rule for 1441(a), as I -- what it says is that

25

you look to see whether there is jurisdiction

from the plaintiff's complaint.

That's the --

But -- but -- but -- I'm

I didn't mean --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So the well-pleaded

7

complaint rule, by contrast, comes from 1331,

8

which is the substantive juris -- the federal

9

question jurisdiction statute, and it's a way

10

of finding out is there original jurisdiction.

11

So you only look at the complaint.

12

But the well-completed complaint rule doesn't

Yeah, but you're

15

saying -- you're -- you're -- there would be

original jurisdiction if this claim were in the

case at the beginning.

18

that.

19

jurisdiction at the beginning, right?

20

what --

So you're saying it's original

21

MR. BLAND:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23
24
25

You would agree with

That's

Yeah, that's right.
So you're reading that

into the text, and you make -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, original is at

the beginning, isn't it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's jurisdiction at

3

the beginning from the original complaint.

4
5

MR. BLAND:

I -- I totally agree with

you.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9
10
11

Well, original --

You agree with Justice

-MR. BLAND:

Yes.

We agree,

absolutely.
JUSTICE ALITO:

-- with Justice

12

Kagan's answer to my question?

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BLAND:

There -- there -- I don't

15

-- I -- I feel like I'm making a TV commercial,

16

but there's only one original.

17

there's the original complaint.

18

original civil action.

19

are claims within it.

20

You know,
There's the

And then -- then there
So --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is -- this

21

is -- this case is very, very complicated.

22

let's go -- let's go back step by step.

23

aside this question of original jurisdiction.

24
25

And

Put

If we look at the text, we have a
reference to the defendant or the defendants.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

So Home Depot would qualify there, would it

2

not?

3

MR. BLAND:

No, because, in -- in the

4

context of 1441(a), defendant is, in that

5

setting, is a defendant in a civil action where

6

there is original jurisdiction.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

You're reading

8

things into it.

But, in the ordinary sense of

9

the term, are they -- are they not defendants?

10

MR. BLAND:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13

They're -- they're -They are some kind of

defendants.
MR. BLAND:

There -- there are lots of

14

colloquial ways in which they would be termed a

15

defendant.

16

every court that's looked at --

17

But, within the meaning of 1441(a),

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Okay.

18

where does this come from?

19

start out with a term that's big enough to

20

encompass them.

21

Where does this limitation come from?

22

from Shamrock Oil, does it not?

23

the origin of it.

24
25

All right?

And
So we

Now we have the limitation.

MR. BLAND:

It comes

That's the --

Shamrock Oil was the first

case to look at a counterclaim defendant from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

this Court, yes.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

And so

3

Shamrock Oil basically says, look, you -- you

4

started out as the plaintiff, and you chose the

5

state forum.

6

with a counterclaim, you can't -- you know, you

7

-- you chose the state court and you're stuck

8

in state court, so you can't remove it to

9

federal court.

10
11

And now that you have been sued

I -- I don't see that Shamrock Oil
goes any further than that.

12

MR. BLAND:

Well, first, I want to --

13

Shamrock Oil is -- is ultimately looking at --

14

at the text.

15

where they said this is not about waiver.

16

this is about is what did Congress provide to

17

you.

18

There is language in Shamrock Oil
What

And so that that key -- there's key

19

language in Shamrock that says it's not about

20

waiver, but it's about what did Congress

21

provide to you.

22

Shamrock -- Shamrock -- in Shamrock, you didn't

23

have an original jurisdiction issue because

24

Shamrock chose to sue in state court, but they

25

could have sued in federal court.

And so then the question is

This case is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

different.

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

They chose

state court.

4

MR. BLAND:

Citibank could never have

5

brought this case in federal court.

6

was never original jurisdiction here where

7

there was original jurisdiction in Shamrock.

8

So Shamrock didn't talk about our argument.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So there

Yeah, but Citibank is

10

gone.

11

case on credit card debt in state court.

12

then suddenly this thing gets transmogrified

13

into a class action that you say, well, this

14

one has to stay in state court despite CAFA.

15

If it had been brought originally in this

16

forum, it would be removable under CAFA.

17

That's what Congress wanted.

18

And, you know, Citibank brought a little
And

And somebody came up with this idea of

19

using this sort of proceeding as a way of

20

getting around CAFA.

21

article that actually says, after CAFA, well,

22

look, we found a way to get around CAFA so that

23

we can keep these things in state court.

And there's a law review

24

Is that not correct?

25

MR. BLAND:

There -- there -- there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

are a number of premises, Your Honor, with

2

which I strongly disagree.

3

So, first of all, CAFA doesn't change

4

what 1441(a) says.

5

in the -- in the Senate report, which this

6

Court treated as being -- having precedential

7

value in the Dart Cherokee case.

8

Four -- CAFA is in the --

The -- the -- the -- the -- the Senate

9

report said that CAFA was intended, the -- the

10

Section 1453, which Justice Breyer was quoting

11

from earlier, was intended to make some

12

alterations to but is -- but is essentially

13

adopting 1440(a).

14

The idea of having counterclaims

15

defendants has been around forever.

16

that there has been some jump in class action

17

counterclaims simply is not empirically true.

18

There was a law review article by an

19

advocate.

20

and a peer-reviewed article.

21

like a blog.

22

article saying --

23
24
25

The idea

It's not really a law review article
I think it's more

But, anyhow, a guy writes an

JUSTICE ALITO:

Since when are law

review -MR. BLAND:

-- we're worried this is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

going to be a lot of our problem.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

review articles peer reviewed?

4
5

MR. BLAND:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Who are they -- who

are they reviewed by?

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BLAND:

10

-- I'm so sorry.

11

that, you're right.

12
13

You know, that's a good

point.

6
7

Since when are law

You're totally right.

I -- I should never have said

JUSTICE ALITO:

They should be --

maybe they should be peer reviewed.

14

MR. BLAND:

Law review articles are

15

student reviewed, they're not peer reviewed.

16

-- I -- I withdraw.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm fine on law

review articles.
(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I have a

21

question.

22

arguments on the other side.

23

I don't think Shamrock really covers it.

25

I

That was --

19

24

I

I think they have very good policy
I understand it.

So I might, at least for purposes of
argument, assume they are a defendant under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

1441 and, if they were alone, they could just

2

remove the case.

3

get into district court, if they get it into

4

district court, Rule 23 applies.

5

problem with that, for a hypothetical, for this

6

question.

7
8
9
10

And when they remove it and

I have no

Where I got stuck, which you will get
me out of -(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is that I think

11

they can't get into federal court without 1453

12

because not all defendants agree with them, or

13

there are a variety of reasons they need 1453.

14

Is that right?

15
16
17
18

MR. BLAND:

So I -- I -- I agree that

they cannot get in -JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm just saying,

is that right?

19

MR. BLAND:

It is.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, if they

21

need 1453, I go to 1453 and I look who can --

22

who can take advantage of 1453, and it talks

23

about a class action.

24

it if we didn't -- if we just stop there.

25

then it says class action shall have the

Now they could surely do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

meanings given to that term under 1332(d)(1).

2

This is just language.

It's just

3

language, no policy, no nothing.

4

1332(d)(1), right, and what do I discover when

5

I get there in the first words?

6

So I turn to

What it says is class action, the very

7

word I just left, the very word that referred

8

me here, means any civil action filed under

9

Rule 23.

10

So I look.

11

filed under Rule 23?

12

Kagan.

13

a plaintiff.

14

to be.

15

Was this a civil action
Now I'm over with Justice

A civil action is an action brought by
And that's just what it happens

It doesn't have to do with claims.

16

And, therefore, since this isn't a civil action

17

filed -- only filed, not what governs it if

18

they're in federal court -- filed under Rule

19

23, it can't -- they can't take advantage of

20

1453 because they don't fit within the

21

definition.

22

Now am I right?

23

MR. BLAND:

24
25

You're right about that,

yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:

If I'm right about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

that, why didn't you make that argument?

2

MR. BLAND:

Because 1453 is

3

essentially -- 1453 amends and changes

4

essentially some of the provisions of 1446 that

5

the Chief Justice was talking about.

6

Essentially, they track each other.

7

1446 sets out the rules for removal,

8

and then there were several rules around CAFA

9

where -- where the -- where Congress was

10

concerned that there were abuses, that cases

11

were being -- were being kept in state court

12

that should be in federal court, so just for

13

class actions, 1453 changes some of the

14

procedural rules.

15

So you no longer require unanimity in

16

all the defendants.

17

who's not -- a defendant in a home state can go

18

forth.

19
20

You can have a defendant

But 1453 is not by itself a grant of
federal jurisdiction the way 1440(a) is.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nobody says it is.

22

All I'm saying is, do they need 1453 to be able

23

to remove?

24
25

MR. BLAND:

For -- for CAFA, yes, they

do.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. BLAND:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And they -- and they -And I look to who

4

does it cover, and it covers a class action as

5

defined in a different statute.

6

if they said class action defined in the

7

antitrust law.

8
9

I don't care

Then I'd go look and see how they
define it in the antitrust law or defined in, I

10

don't care what, I mean, defined in the

11

criminal code.

12

me to that, so I went and looked at that.

13

But I want to -- they referred

And when I looked at that, I saw class

14

action is defined as I just said.

15

question is, same question, great argument for

16

you.

17

something wrong with my thinking, and that's

18

what I'm trying to find out.

19

MR. BLAND:

Why didn't you make it?

Okay.

So my

And so there's

Well, I think -- I think

20

that we were focusing on -- on 1440(a) as the

21

grant of removal jurisdiction, 1446 as the

22

procedures, and 1453 not as a new grant of

23

removal jurisdiction but just more procedures.

24
25

And so, to the extent that there's
just no original jurisdiction over a civil

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

action under 1440(a), we think that's the end

2

of it.

3

vast majority of our advocacy.

So that's where we have focused the

4

I think that the point you make about

5

1453 is -- is extremely clever and wish we had

6

-- had -- had articulated it more better.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. BLAND:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

help you.

But I think that -I wasn't trying to

I'm not there right beside you.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. BLAND:

But I do think that

13

1440(a) is -- is where -- where this case

14

starts and ends.

15

cases going back to the 1890s really govern.

16

The original jurisdiction

I want to point out for a second now,

17

since there's been a lot of discussion about

18

this difference between a civil action and a

19

claim, and also this word "defendant" if it's

20

defendant now is not just the original

21

defendant, but a defendant's cross-claim or

22

counterclaim or whatever different rule you

23

want to use, 13, 14, 19, or -- or something

24

like that, that it's going to have a gigantic

25

effect not on class actions but on all sorts of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1
2

individual cases.
And here's why:

So picture just a

3

regular state law negligence case where a

4

defendant's a resident of the same state as the

5

plaintiff, and the defendant would really like

6

to be in federal court.

7

first bite at the apple, right?

8

an out-of-state insurer.

9

They'd like their
And they have

Right now, if that defendant brings a

10

claim against the out-of-state insurer, no --

11

no diversity jurisdiction, even if it's over

12

the jurisdictional amount, because you don't

13

have complete diversity; you have the defendant

14

and the plaintiff's same.

15

Under their rule, now what you do is

16

you look at the claim by claim, instead of by

17

the original civil action, going back to the

18

word "original."

19

at things claim by claim, there is diversity

20

between the two defendants.

21

So, if you now start looking

So every single time you have a

22

personal injury case in which there's a

23

defendant who wants to be out of federal court

24

and they have an out-of-state insurer, so

25

basically any company who's not in Connecticut

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

will be able to now name their insurance

2

company through some sort of third-party claim,

3

and now why isn't there diversity jurisdiction?

4

The simple answer is there is.

5

Another thing that their idea is of --

6

of broadening the idea of -- definition of --

7

of what is a defendant from the -- you know,

8

from the rule that has been affirmed by

9

literally dozens and dozens of district courts

10

and circuit courts around the country for

11

years, and you'd go from 1440(a)'s limit on

12

civil action to instead have a -- a rule that's

13

going to turn upon claims, is you can start

14

having a lot of business-to-business disputes

15

that right now would be in state court that

16

could get into federal court.

17

So, for example, there are a lot of

18

cases in which corporations would rather have

19

their cases, with all respect to the federal

20

courts, in Delaware state courts, where there's

21

a lot of sophistication, a lot of rules that

22

have been built up.

23

Valley companies who are more interested in

24

being in -- in San Jose -- in the state courts

25

of California, where there's a lot of

There are a lot of Silicon

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

sophistication around their particular issues

2

that's built up.

3

So what happens if you're a defendant

4

in one of these cases and you suddenly decide,

5

you know, I really wish I hadn't made this deal

6

because the law that's built up is bad for me,

7

you find another company, bring a cross-claim

8

against them.

9

whether or not there's diversity is based upon

Now their -- under their theory,

10

a claim-by-claim basis.

11

say, oh, we're going to bring a cross-claim

12

against them.

13

even though under all the law that's existed up

14

to now, we're now going to change this and the

15

defendant's not just going to be the defendant

16

to the original claim; they're going to be a

17

cross-claim, counterclaim, whatever.

18

cases, a company is going to be able to change

19

its mind and bring those cases in --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

You look at them and

They're a defendant because,

In those

I -- I have -- I

have -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, perhaps it's not

23

possible to decide this case in a way that

24

doesn't go as -- doesn't effectively decide all

25

these other different situations that you've --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

you've posited, but if we look just at what

2

happened here -- and this -- and this involves

3

not -- I mean, this implicates not just the

4

original removal statute but CAFA, is there any

5

good reason why a claim like this, if you

6

accept CAFA, why this should be -- should not

7

be removable to -- to federal court?

8
9

MR. BLAND:

Yes, Your Honor, because

CAFA is a balancing act.

CAFA is -- if CAFA

10

was a preemption statute, it would not be a

11

field preemption, it would be an express

12

preemption.

13

they were unhappy about and they solved those

14

problems.

15

Congress saw certain problems that

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you think CAFA

16

said, well, if -- if a claim like this is filed

17

originally in federal -- in state court, it can

18

be removed, but if it comes into the state

19

court in this strange sort of back-door way,

20

then it has to stay in state court.

21

think that that's a possible decision Congress

22

would make?

23

MR. BLAND:

You really

So, first of all, I -- I

24

do think it's possible because, as Justice

25

Sotomayor said earlier, I think that you assume

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

that Congress knows the backdrop against which

2

it's -- it's legislating.

3

lawyers when they're writing these laws.

4

They have a bunch of

Congress had repeatedly changed the --

5

the jurisdiction statute.

6

was the amendment to overturn this Court's

7

decision in the Holmes versus Vornado case,

8

where the Congress said any party can remove a

9

case, not a defendant, in the -- the America

10

Invents Act.

So, in 2011, there

The America Invents Act is --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

-- I mean, that's based on the --

13
14
15

MR. BLAND:

Well, I mean, that's

Congress could have done

it.
JUSTICE ALITO:

-- the idea that they

16

-- they -- they were aware of these district

17

court cases.

18

district court cases.

They're -- they're almost all

19

MR. BLAND:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

That's -- that's correct.

okay, we -- we want to accept that.

22

MR. BLAND:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MR. BLAND:

25

And they said, well,

Right.
I mean, that's --

I mean, it's quite

possible that Congress never thought of this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

because it just wasn't really a very big

2

problem and it wasn't one of the issues that

3

came up in the hearings.

4

tracked the hearings at the time.

5

remember anyone talking about it.

6

I -- I sort of
I don't

I mean, this Court has said on a

7

number of occasions that even if you think that

8

there is something that if Congress had thought

9

about they would have done something, you can't

10

engraft a solution into what Congress said

11

to -- to address the problem.

12

I mean, I think it's possible that --

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

I'm sorry.

15

1453?

Is Home Depot a defendant under

16

MR. BLAND:

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

18
19

Is Home Depot --

No, Your Honor, because -And what -- what

is it then?
MR. BLAND:

It's -- it's a -- it's a

20

counterclaim or third- -- third-party claim

21

defendant.

22

defendant for -- for --

23
24
25

And that's just different than a

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So, when it says

any defendant, that doesn't include -MR. BLAND:

Right, because --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1
2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- that kind of

defendant?

3

MR. BLAND:

Right, because the word

4

"defendant" in the removal statutes has this --

5

has this fixed meaning from 1440(a).

6

putting the word "any" in front of it doesn't

7

change.

8
9

And

So if you had -- if Congress had a
statute that said -- or a statute about

10

rabbits, and then they amended it and said "any

11

rabbit," that doesn't mean that a weasel or a

12

gerbil becomes a rabbit.

13

-- the word "any" in front of a noun leaves the

14

noun as what it is.

15

You know, it's still

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

16

still means that a brown rabbit is a rabbit.

17

In other words, when you were describing what

18

they were, you said a counterclaim defendant or

19

a third-party defendant, it's a type of

20

defendant.

21

"any defendant," it would seem that it includes

22

those as well.

23

And if you have a statute that says

MR. BLAND:

It's a type of defendant

24

in a colloquial way, Your Honor, but I don't --

25

I disagree with the concept that it's a type of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

defendant for purposes of the removal statutes.

2

I think for --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

people speak colloquially of third-party

5

defendants?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. BLAND:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Which was not

I mean, it's --

10

it's -- it's only used as a fairly technical

11

term.

12

MR. BLAND:

Right.

And -- and -- and

13

-- and in the removal statutes, the word

14

"defendant" has -- has this meaning where it's

15

-- it's not by itself, but it is cabined by

16

civil action on one side and original

17

jurisdiction on the other side, which this

18

Court has -- has repeatedly interpreted to say

19

that -- that third-party counterclaimants and

20

so forth in all other settings are not

21

included.

22

So the only question is, does CAFA

23

change anything by sticking the word "any" in

24

front of it?

25

what Congress was trying to do in that

And -- but the thing is we know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

sentence.

What Congress was trying to do was

2

there was a concern that plaintiffs' lawyers

3

were supposedly going out and suing several

4

defendants and they would pick one who was sort

5

of their buddy who was not going to agree to

6

removal, and so then that one said, well, no,

7

you wouldn't be able to get unanimous agreement

8

from all the defendants to remove.

9

that's what that provision was aimed at, was

And so

10

the unanimous consent, that everyone was

11

supposed to agree.

12

And the Senate report says that clear

13

as day.

And if you read the whole sentence in

14

context, what the word "any" there means is

15

each and every.

16

they're saying each and every defendant

17

separately has the right to remove this case to

18

federal court.

19

It means each and every.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

But it -- that does

20

say -- I mean, you know, you heard his policy

argument.

22

understand it, and he does use -- the rules use

23

the word "defendant" to refer to his client in

24

this situation.

25

some other qualifications in front of it.

It's a little hard to see why if you

they have one of those things, you know, where

22

they say like there's like this sort of list,

like five myths where they say things that

24

people -- or bad things people say about CAFA

25

but aren't true.

One of them was, well, some

people say it's going to federalize all class

actions.

3

50 percent of class actions will remain in

Actually, we expect that more than

It was never intended to federalize

have said that.

But instead of treating

how 1453 tracks 1446.

that Congress was upset about and they were

trying to fix those things.

trying to -- they weren't trying to federalize

So, I mean, this is not the kind of

case -- this case, even if -- there's a way in

8

which this entire argument in some ways, Your

9

Honors, is a -- is -- is -- is a -- while

10

incredibly complicated for me at least, is a --

11

is an abstraction in the sense that this case

12

is going to end up in state court under the --

under the -- the home state removal -- the

14

local -- the local removal section anyhow of

But CAFA was not attempting
If they

There are a lot of decisions Congress

22

has made here.

When they've wanted to say

23

"claims," they've said, in the bankruptcy code

24

in 1441, claims.

25

"civil action," they meant something else.

When they wanted to say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62

they'd wanted to federalize everything, they

2

would have federalized everything.

3

want to here.

They didn't

4

If they had wanted to say third-party

5

counterclaimants, they would have done exactly

6

what they did in the America Invents Act where,

7

when they didn't like one of this Court's

8

decisions that admittedly was under the

9

well-pleaded complaint rule, but in Footnote 2,

10

this Court cited the exact same language that

11

we were talking about under the original

jurisdiction statute.

And so it's clear that it's a removal

rule.

This is an issue where, if Congress is

They

Official - Subject to Final Review

They know how to say claim instead of civil

action.

3

The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the

4

statutes here, you know, it may well be that if

5

Congress had thought about this in CAFA, they

6

just said, well, we don't really like that,

7

they would have done something differently.

8

But you can't rewrite the statute for them on

9

the grounds that they didn't --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they could have

11

been -- they surely -- they could have been

12

more specific in a way that favors Home Depot.

13

They also could have been more specific in a

14

way that favors you, right?

15

It's pretty hard to argue that when

16

they said any defendants, they said we're going

17

to say any defendants because we don't want to

18

include the kind of defendant that Home Depot

19

is.

20

MR. BLAND:

Well, it's in a sentence

21

where, if you look at the sentence as a whole

22

-- if you look at the sentence as a whole, it

23

says "class action may be removed in accordance

24

with Section 1446 without regard to whether any

25

defendant is a citizen of the state in which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

the action was brought, except that such action

2

may be removed by any defendant without the

3

consent of all defendants."

4

When they used the word "any" there,

5

they mean each and every.

6

to do is solve the problem I was just talking

7

about a second ago about where you have

8

unanimous -- where you -- the unanimous

9

requirement that everyone has to agree to

10
11

What they are trying

remove.
It's -- it's absolutely crystal-clear

12

what they meant and they -- and they said in

13

the Senate report what they meant.

14

take that word and say that now it's going to

15

change the nature of a defendant so that

16

Section 1440(a) is now going to mean something

17

different for class actions than it means

18

everywhere else, that's really a problem.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so to

Why isn't --

20

okay, each and every.

21

and every defendant in the civil action, in the

22

proceeding?

23

MR. BLAND:

Why doesn't it mean each

Because what -- what their

24

-- what the point of what they're saying is

25

they're saying each and every defendant has a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

separate right to decide that they want to

2

remove the case to federal court, that you

3

don't have to have unanimity.

4

And the Congress said the point of

5

what we're aiming at here in the -- in the

6

Senate report was to avoid unanimity.

7
8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it still

works with respect to Home Depot.
MR. BLAND:

I -- I -- with respect,

10

Your Honor, it -- it's -- it is a -- a -- a --

11

a procedural change -- it -- that -- that --

12

that -- that tracks part of 1446 and says this

13

doesn't apply here.

14

has the right, the power, to remove under

15

1440(a), where the word "defendant" has a

16

different meaning.

17

But it is not changing who

The word "defendant" there talks about

18

original jurisdiction.

19

certainly does not have original jurisdiction

20

here under this -- under the -- under the whole

21

line of cases both from this Court and then the

22

ton of district court cases that came

23

afterwards applying it to third-party

24

counterclaim defendants.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And Home Depot

Is what you're saying,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

Mr. Bland, that 1446 changes a number of the

2

procedures by which you can remove?

3

not, it never before --

MR. BLAND:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. BLAND:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. BLAND:

9

1453 is the CAFA one.
1453.

1453 changes 1446.
Right.

Sorry, but otherwise

you're --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

MR. BLAND:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

It does

Exactly right.

Sorry.
I'm confusing things

in an effort to make them more clear.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. BLAND:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's my life.
So 1453 changes a

17

number of the procedures in 1446 so that there

18

are different procedures in CAFA suits as to

19

removal.

20

1453 does not -- does not purport to

21

and simply does not affect the grant of removal

22

jurisdiction.

23

jurisdiction can only be found in one place,

24

and that's in 1441(a).

25

The grant of removal

MR. BLAND:

Yes, exactly, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

And so, if there are no further questions, that

is -- that's exactly right, and if Congress

wanted to change it, they could have.

on $5 million.

There are no compromises on

On Justice Kagan's original
