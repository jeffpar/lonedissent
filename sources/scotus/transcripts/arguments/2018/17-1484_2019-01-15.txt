CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Allina Health Services.

Mr. Kneedler.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 1395hh did not require CMS to

12

go through notice-and-comment rulemaking before

13

it could furnish its calculation of one

14

component of a hospital's reimbursement to the

15

contractors that perform the initial

16

determination of reimbursement for the agency.

17

That calculation was not binding on

18

the agency, the courts, or Respondents, and it

19

could be challenged on administrative appeal,

20

as, in fact, Respondents did here.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a -- a sort

22

of problem with this.

And I know you say that,

23

but I don't know how you take this outside of

24

being a policy, meaning it's applying to every

25

single provider uniformly.

I don't know the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

basis that you could have a individual

2

adjudication.

3

board would look at it and say we're not going

4

to listen, even though we're required to

5

listen, to the agency's position; we're going

6

to tell them they're wrong?

7

And what would happen?

The

If one case tells you the agency is

8

wrong, does that case then become the new

9

policy?

10

Or -- or are you -- I'm a little lost

as to how this is not a agency policy.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

So several points.
A statement of

policy.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several points, Justice

15

Sotomayor.

16

relying on the operative language in 1395hh,

17

whether it's called a -- whether the issuance

18

is called a policy or a requirement or whatever

19

the agency calls it.

20

triggers notice-and-comment rulemaking if it

21

establishes or changes a substantive legal

22

standard.

23

And the -- the first is that we are

It is only -- it only

And that is the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's what

24

I'm -- that's what I'm having a problem with.

25

It's every single provider is going to be given

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

a fraction that incorporates your policy, and

2

that binds what they're going to get.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it -- it --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because they have

5

to use that fraction in the claims they made

6

against you.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it only governs

8

what the contractor does.

The contractor is

9

just like an agency employee, making

10

determinations on behalf of the agency at the

11

first step.

12

When -- when the --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

From you -- from

14

the contractor, from the agency, they're only

15

going to get the fraction as you told the

16

contractor to calculate it.

17
18
19

MR. KNEEDLER:
appeal.

Only if they don't

And -- and as -- as we point out -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I just don't

20

understand what difference it means -- it means

21

-- I mean, even a regulation or a rule may have

22

legal meaning only until it's accepted, but

23

even a rule can be challenged later on appeal.

24

The grounds for that challenge might

25

be different, but I can go into court and say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

it's ultra vires.

2

it's not supported by the statute.

3

binding in -- in any meaningful way, other than

4

that's what the agency's going to do.

5

I can go into court and say

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's not

Well, if I -- if I may,

6

in our view, 1395hh codifies for the Medicare

7

program what this Court referred to in Chrysler

8

Corporation as the central distinction in the

9

APA between substantive and interpretive rules.

10

And this Court in Guernsey --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem

12

I have is that the provision adds something.

13

It's not just rule or regulation; it's

14

statement of policy.

15

to me that there's some interpretive rules that

16

are encompassed by that.

17

open question.

And it seems to suggest

Now which ones is the

18

But it does seem to suggest that it's

19

broader than the APA ever was, because the APA

20

only talks about rules.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, several

22

points -- several points about that.

This

23

Court's decision in Guernsey Memorial Hospital,

24

which described the general APA standards,

25

distinguished between substantive rules and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

interpretive rules.

2

And the interpretive rule there was

3

something in the provider reimbursement manual

4

which, just as here, bound the contractor but

5

could be changed -- or could be challenged --

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
didn't --

8
9

Mr. Kneedler, why

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- and set aside on

appeal.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- why didn't

11

Congress just say this is like the APA?

12

does it change the language at all?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -I have to give

15

some meaning different than the APA to

16

Congress's express choice of a different

17

articulation of the standard.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why

Well, first of all,

19

when -- when Congress first enacted the

20

provisions or amended the provisions in the

21

rulemaking in 1986, it said certain regulations

22

-- regulations have to go through notice and

23

comment.

24

point.

25

It didn't define regulation at that

But the conference report said this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

does not require notice-and-comment rulemaking

2

for interpretive rules or other things that are

3

not now subject to that requirement.

4

Then, in 1987, Congress revisited the

5

-- the provision.

6

of our brief, we -- we set out the House

7

version, the version that was passed by the

8

House, and then -- and contrast that to the

9

version that was finally enacted.

10

And if you look at page 34

The House -- the House version said no

11

rule requirement or other statement of policy

12

that has or may have a significant effect on

13

the payment for services can go into effect

14

unless promulgated through notice-and-comment

15

rulemaking.

16

That was changed in conference.

And the enacted language kept

17

everything but substituted for that italicized

18

language the phrase "that has" -- that --

19

excuse me, "that establishes or changes a

20

substantive legal standard."

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is -- is this right?

22

I mean, I -- it's very complicated, what you're

23

saying.

24

for a long time in Medicare they didn't have to

25

follow the APA.

I thought it was quite simple, that

All right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

Then Congress passes a statute and

2

says, in this area, you do.

3

says no rule, requirement, or other statement

4

of policy is they have certain policy

5

statements in mind, certain requirements in

6

mind, and certain rules in mind, namely, those

7

that establish or change a substantive legal

8

standard.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

So the reason it

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that -And, basically, what

11

they're doing is saying to the agency, don't

12

run around this.

13

run-around, where what you do is you change the

14

legal standard and you call what you're doing a

15

statement of policy.

16

my friend.

17
18

We're not going to permit a

So don't run around us,

You follow the APA.

Now that is what I took out of your
brief, but have I got that right?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

-- that is exactly our position.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that is exactly
And the --

So why didn't you say

22

that was the answer to what Justice Sotomayor

23

said?

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

I have with that --

2
3

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I -- I tried to

start down that path --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- counsel --

-- but I -- but that --- but -- but let

7

me -- let me stop you.

If that's what Congress

8

intended, it could have stopped in 1986

9

because, in 1986, it had done what you said.

10

But something -- and you read the House

11

report --

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

The House bill.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the House

14

bill -- was leading them to believe that a

15

different standard was necessary because they

16

changed it.

17

They chose intentionally to alter it by

18

altering it in '87.

19

They had the APA standard in 1986.

And you look at the rejection of the

20

House bill as something that helps you, but I'm

21

not sure how.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because it tells

24

me they are significantly concerned about

25

things that make major changes, substantive

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

changes in how people are being paid.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

And -- and here's --

3

here's what matters there, as -- as I pointed

4

out.

5

significant effect.

6

ordinary statements of policy or interpretive

7

rules.

8

Congress enacted something that -- that refers

9

only to substantive legal standards.

Congress substituted has or may have a
Maybe that would sweep in

10

But the -- the Conference Committee and

And the committee report said this

11

language reflects recent court rulings.

12

recent court rulings could only be APA rulings

13

because there was nothing else that would have

14

governed Medicare.

15

The

And, in fact, as we point out in our

16

brief, there was an American Hospital

17

Association case decided, I think, just a

18

matter of several weeks before the Conference

19

Committee that was very similar to this, and it

20

involved instructions affecting peer review

21

organizations, which are contractors that

22

operate on behalf of HHS under the Medicare

23

program.

24
25

And the court there drew a sharp
distinction between substantive rules on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

one hand and interpretive and procedural rules

2

on the other hand.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the answer is that

4

it didn't do what it's trying to do in 1986.

5

What it talked about was any regulation, which

6

could have included interpretive regulations.

7

I would have found out, because I read

8

the House reports.

9

irrelevant might not have understood the

10

But those who think they're

statute.

11

And, moreover, there was an argument

12

going on in the D.C. Circuit about what is a

13

legislative rule.

14

unimportant, or is it legally binding versus

15

non-legally binding no matter how unimportant?

16

Is it just important versus

All right.

That's what they're

17

thinking about.

And it's confused.

18

1987 statute clarifies it.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

Yes.

And the

We --

Am I right or not

right?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, we agree.

But --

23

but all -- but 1986, we think, makes that clear

24

too.

25

specifically says interpretive rules are not

Not only the conference report, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

covered, in fact, nothing's covered that wasn't

2

already covered by the APA, but the -- the --

3

the term "regulation" as used itself connotes a

4

-- a substantive rule, a -- a legislative type

5

rule.

6

People may talk about interpretive

7

rules.

You don't usually talk about

8

interpretive regulations.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Kneedler, this

10

is where I get stuck.

11

focusing more on the language of the statute, I

12

confess, than -- than the history, which I've

13

read but I -- I find confused, as Justice

14

Breyer suggests.

15

And I'm -- I'm -- I'm

So (a)(2) says that any rule,

16

requirement, or other statement of policy that

17

establishes a substantive legal change has to

18

go through informal rulemaking, not even formal

19

rulemaking.

20

boils down to what does "substantive" mean, I

21

think, as -- as -- as I understand it.

22

And the import of that in the

And so, really, the question all

23

government's view is that it's binding, as

24

opposed to an interpretive rule, borrowing

25

language from the APA.

And your friend on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

other side reads substantive, as it's often

2

read elsewhere in the law, as material or

3

affecting private rights, as opposed to

4

procedural.

5

And both seem to me pretty plausible

6

interpretations of that word.

7

strikes against you, as I see it from the text

8

of the statute, are a few.

9

And -- and the

First, the statute speaks of

10

statements of policy as being substantive.

11

But, of course, in APA language, statements of

12

policy are interpretive.

13

substantive.

14

reasonable sense.

15

They're not

They don't bind the agency in any

It speaks of substantive changes in an

16

interpretive rule in (e).

17

that's like a -- a complete incoherent

18

statement in APA language, but entirely

19

coherent in the language of the law if

20

"substantive" means material.

21

And, of course,

And then, of course, the statute also

22

adopts the APA good faith -- the good clause

23

exception to -- to -- to rulemaking verbatim.

24

And it clearly doesn't adopt the substantive

25

interpretive language verbatim, which is right

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

next door in -- in the APA.

2

next section.

3

I mean, it's the

And you're asking us to think that

4

Congress recreated that section in this statute

5

through this rather oblique mechanism.

6
7
8
9

So, there, I've put my cards on the
table.

Tell me where I've gone wrong.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

Starting with

the good cause exception, as -- as we say, in

10

our view, the statute only applies to

11

substantive or legislative rules.

12

cause exception under the APA applies to things

13

that have to go through notice-and-comment

14

rulemaking, which are substantive rules, so it

15

was necessary to incorporate that.

16

And the good

But, in -- in our view, the text of

17

the provision, which refers only to substantive

18

legal standards, does not include interpretive

19

rules to begin with or procedural rules for

20

that matter, so there's no need to have an

21

express exception because the operative text

22

excludes it.

23

With respect to the substantive change

24

in regulations under (e)(1), it does not say

25

substantive legal standard, which is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

operative language in -- in (a)(2).

2

substantive change.

3

It says a

And we think "substantive" means in

4

substance, as opposed to perhaps form or

5

wording or something like that.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then you would be

7

using the word "substantive" in two different

8

ways in two very nearby provisions, wouldn't

9

you?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but we -- but we

11

think that they -- that they have a different

12

effect.

13

said an interpretive rule can address something

14

of substance, it's -- for example, if it's

15

interpreting a statute or a regulation, it may

16

have some effect as a substantive matter, but

17

it is not binding.

But even -- but even -- even if you

18

And what this Court has said in -- in

19

Chrysler Corporation, said it in Guernsey

20

Memorial Hospital, which deals with this very

21

program, a substantive rule is one that has the

22

force and effect of law.

23

does not.

24

construction of the statutes and rules that it

25

implements.

An interpretive rule

It simply explains the agency's

So --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Kneedler,

2

there's a lot of words there, but I'm not sure

3

there's an answer to Justice Kagan's question.

4

So I'm -- I'm going to give you an opportunity

5

to try again, because it's very important to me

6

as well.

7

Aren't you using the word

8

"substantive" in two different senses, first in

9

the APA's -- what I call the APA sense in (a),

10

and then what I'll call the other traditional

11

legal sense in (e)?

12

your colleague on the other side that it is

13

used in that sense at least in (e), I believe.

14

So you're conceding to

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- it doesn't

15

say substantive rule or substantive standard,

16

which would be the --

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Substantive -- it

18

says substantive change to an interpretive

19

rule.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22
23

Right.
Which is a nonsense

under your view, I believe.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But -- but substantive

24

there, we -- we think in substance is

25

whatever -- no, I'm -- I'm -- I'm serious, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

what it refers to.

2

meaningful.

It's not in form.

It's

3

But beyond that, the -- the subsequent

4

words used in the section refer to regulations,

5

manual instructions, interpretive rules,

6

statements of policy.

7

regulations, which are the things that have to

8

go through notice-and-comment under (a), from

9

the subsequent things, manual instructions,

10
11

It is distinguishing

interpretive rules, which do not.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Again, a lot of

12

words, but I think at the end of the day you

13

are agreeing that Congress is using that word

14

in two different senses, right?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we -- we think

16

the phrase "substantive change" here is

17

different from substantive legal standard,

18

which is -- we think is the same as substantive

19

-- as substantive rule.

20
21

And, I'm sorry, I -- I forgot the
third point you asked me.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

because that's hanging me up too.

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Statement of policy,

Okay.

State --

statement of policy, again, frankly, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

that is an artifact of the House version of the

2

-- of the bill.

3

read off no rule, requirement, or other

4

statement of policy that has or may have a

5

significant effect.

6

If you go back to page 34, it

It's possible that a statement of

7

policy, or an interpretive rule, could have a

8

significant effect on -- on --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
MR. KNEEDLER:

This one does.

-- interpretation, but

11

it doesn't have the force of law.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're -- you're

13

agreeing it's incoherent as written.

14

that when the language was different it was not

15

incoherent?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's just

Well -As written, it's

18

incoherent because a statement of policy is, by

19

definition, not a substantive rule?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, but I think it --

21

I think it serves the purpose that Justice

22

Breyer was identifying, basically saying we

23

don't care what you call it, whether you call

24

it a rule, whether you call it a requirement,

25

whether you call it a statement of policy.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

A rule, after all, includes

2

interpretive rules.

3

it, a rule, a requirement, or a statement of

4

policy, it -- it covers -- it's only covered if

5

it would have established or changed a

6

substantive legal standard.

7
8

And, in fact, the conference report on
the 1987 amendment specifically stresses --

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10
11

What would be the --

--

13

So no matter what you call

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- substantive legal

standards.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What would be the

17

point of that, though, if a statement of policy

18

couldn't have operative legal effect on anyone

19

anyway?

20
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, if -- if

-- if that was the --

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I mean, a party

23

would simply say that's just a statement of

24

policy.

25

Have a nice day.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but if -- but if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

it -- if it purports to, as the language the

2

Court used in Chrysler, to establish a

3

substantive legal standard, it's not just a

4

statement of policy.

5

of policy.

6

It's called a statement

Then it actually describes --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, then it's not

7

a statement -- then the argument would be it's

8

not a statement of policy, right?

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, that -- that --

that is true, but that -- but that --

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

-- that doesn't mean

13

that -- that doesn't mean it's not -- it's not

14

a statement of policy within the precise

15

meaning of the APA.

16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they don't want

a run-around.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
But, (e), they don't

20

run around it by calling it a statement of

21

policy when you're --

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Right.
-- changing the

substantive -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but it's at least

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

--

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and I have a

3

different question, which is (e), which is

4

because they are using the word "substantive

5

change" there possibly in a different sense.

6

So -- so -- so I -- I agree with that,

7

and I -- but I thought that (e) has something

8

to do that's not involved here.

9

of codification of a different common law rule

(e) is a kind

10

of administrative law that, when you do

11

something retroactively that's important, Mr.

12

Agency, you better have a reason.

13

look at why you've changed it.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

Right.
If you're changing

policy, go look at it and explain it to us.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Right.
Something this Court

has said many, many times.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

Right.
And I thought that's

what (e) is about.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

You better

Yes.
It's a different

subject.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that is --

2

that's correct in our view.

And it talks about

3

a substantive change in regulations, again,

4

which are the things that have to go through

5

notice-and-comment rule -- rulemaking under

6

subsection (a).

7

instructions, interpretive rules, statements of

8

policy or guidelines, which do not have the

9

force and effect of law, they are not

And then goes on to say manual

10

substantive rules or, in the language here,

11

they do not establish or change substantive

12

legal standards.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

May -- may -And so it distinguishes

15

right -- right in there the reg -- the sort of

16

regulations that (a) is talking about and these

17

-- these non-binding sorts of things that --

18

that either way they should be made

19

retroactive.

20

interpretation shouldn't be made retroactive

21

unless it -- it goes through -- unless the

22

agency makes it specified.

23

If they're interpretive, the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May -- may I take you

24

back, Mr. Kneedler, to one of Justice

25

Sotomayor's original questions, which is just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

what, on your theory, this provision ends up

2

actually accomplishing?

3

Because, as I understand the 19 -- the

4

1986, the -- the prior year's provision,

5

Congress essentially already said, for Medicare

6

substantive rules, you have to go through

7

notice and comment.

8

would have been different if it was the

9

original version of the thing, the "has or may

10

And I understand how this

have a significant effect."

11

But, as written, on your theory, it

12

seems to just repeat the 1986 command, doesn't

13

it?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, the House

15

would have done something broader in 1987.

16

I -- and I think that the -- I think the Court

17

should realize that --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

But are you saying --

19

I want to make sure I understand this.

20

saying that the compromise was essentially to

21

just repeat the 1986 provision?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Are you

I mean, I think

23

-- I think that is -- it was carried forward.

24

And the -- and, again, the conference committee

25

report stresses that only things that establish

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1
2

or change a substantive legal standard.
And that -- the word "substantive" in

3

the rulemaking context has a -- has a long

4

history in administrative law under the APA.

5

It also -- the distinction -- that very

6

distinction is drawn in Black's Law Dictionary,

7

as we explain in our -- in our brief.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, it is a little

9

bit odd, don't you agree, Mr. Kneedler,

10

because, if the compromise was not to do

11

anything beyond 1986, then you would think that

12

people would just say, okay, let's not do it.

13

Not put in a new -- a new -- a new statute

14

saying precisely the same thing.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the bill

16

was in conference -- in conference at that

17

point, and there were several other things that

18

were in the bill at that point.

19

this change was not the only one.

20

This is --

The bill was in conference, and they

21

-- the conference committee decided that

22

something should be enacted, rather than

23

nothing done at all.

24

provision, we think that it -- that --

25

But, as to this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It's entirely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

superfluous?

2
3

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I -- I don't think

it's --

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

No, I don't think it's

superfluous.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

-- which is to say

it is superfluous.
MR. KNEEDLER:

It was not in the

statute in 1986.

23
24

Well, it was not -- it

was not in the --

21
22

It reiterates, okay.

It reiterates what's already the law --

19
20

No, it -- it -- it

reiterates through the use of such --

17
18

But substantively --

sorry -- it does nothing new?

15
16

Well, it -- it -- it

elaborates on --

13
14

It does nothing new?

substitutes -- it -- it elaborates -- it

11
12

It does nothing?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Can I -- can I take

you -MR. KNEEDLER:

The statute referred to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1
2

regulation -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Can I take you back

3

just to one other problem I have?

You want us

4

to -- to -- to view this statute as very

5

carefully using APA terminology when it comes

6

to substantive.

7

statements of policy, you want us to ignore the

8

fact that what -- what the APA -- how it treats

9

them and say even faux statements of policy

But, when it comes to

10

that are really rules and requirements and

11

regulations, that's what it's aiming at.

12

that a problem for you too?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Isn't

No, I don't -- I don't

14

think so because the -- the statement of policy

15

is in the opening clause, which refers to

16

rules, which could include interpretive rules,

17

requirement, or statement of policy.

18
19
20
21

Those are descriptions of the kind of
agency issues -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But when is ever a

statement of policy binding?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Pardon me?

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning, when is a

24

statement -- if it's not a rule or regulation,

25

if it's just a statement of policy, when is it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28

ever binding as you've defined "binding"?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

I -Isn't policy

something that can be challenged?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it -- it is, but

6

I think it's important for the Court to focus

7

on the -- on the operative language, which is

8

whether it changes -- establishes or changes a

9

substantive legal standard.

10

That's what

Congress enacted.

11

I'd also like to point out what the

12

consequences of this for the Medicare program

13

are.

14

Guernsey Memorial Hospital and other cases, the

15

Medicare program has, you know, hundreds of

16

pages of statutes, probably thousands of pages

17

of regulations, but the Court has recognized

18

that that can't answer all questions that come

19

up.

As -- as this Court has pointed out in

20

And -- and the Court in Guernsey

21

recognized the importance of interpretive

22

materials like, in that case, a provision in

23

the provider reimbursement manual.

24

similar manuals governing the program integrity

25

for hospitals and doctors and -- and -- and

There are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

whatnot.

2

that are -- that are fleshed out in the manual.

3

There are still reimbursement issues

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I look at the

4

subsequent history of this in -- in the D.C.

5

Circuit, and I look at Clarian Health West, and

6

your fears there are overstated.

7

significant change was held not to be

8

encompassed by this provision because it really

9

was just following the statute.

10

A fairly

This is filling a gap in the statute.

11

I don't know what else is clearly more a policy

12

than that when you're filling in a gap as

13

opposed to interpreting a statute.

14

seems to be the distinction the D.C. -- D.C.

15

Circuit is applying.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

And that

Well, Clarian did not

17

go to the substantive provisions for

18

reimbursement.

19

for various screening.

20
21

It had to do with a procedure

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
That's my point.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

That's my point.

Yes, but it -Which is not

everything is going to come under this.
MR. KNEEDLER:

It's not everything,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

but it -- but it -- but it certainly would

rulemaking a broad swath of what has never been

done.

This is --

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, on that -- on

that -MR. KNEEDLER:

-- this is 30 years

later in HHS -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- on that -- on

10

that, though, I don't doubt it's more

11

convenient for the government to proceed

12

through adjudication of an individual case and

13

announce a new rule that applies to the whole

14

of society without inviting comment and

15

providing notice to everyone affected.

16

I -- I get that that's easier and preferable,

17

certainly more efficient.

18

Surely,

But couldn't Congress make rationally

19

an alternative decision that informal

20

rulemaking, not even formal rulemaking, that's

21

gone by the boards, but just informal notice

22

and comment to affected parties in something as

23

significant as changing the formula for

24

Medicare for all Medicare providers nationwide,

25

that maybe they should have 60 days to at least

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

throw in their comments.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, first of all, the

3

agency has tried to go through

4

notice-and-comment rulemaking twice on this.

5

It did -- it did it in 2004, when the issue was

6

brought to its attention.

7

It recognizes that.

8
9

It did it in 2013.

But what it did here was -- was not -not establish a binding provision that has the

10

force and effect of law but simply furnish

11

fractions to the contractors who were

12

performing calculations at the very first stage

13

of the -- of the process.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I very quickly

15

ask you, given Clarian Health, what

16

consequences are you afraid of?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Afraid of, again, the

18

broad swath of -- of manual provisions that --

19

I mean, that -- that really just dealt with

20

procedures.

21

you could look at it as -- as recognizing the

22

procedures.

evaluate certain situations without changing

I mean, I -- in -- in one respect,

Procedural rules are not covered

2

And that's our -- you know, when it

3

comes to interpretive rules, that's our

4

position, because they -- they explain the

5

agency's own interpretation, but it's the

statute that governs, not -- and this is not a

regulation that establishes a substantive legal

standard on its own terms.

18

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
By making the legal determination to

19

count Part C days as Part A entitled days in

20

the Medicare fraction, the agency's 2014

21

issuance reduced the payment right of hospitals

22

nationwide by -- and this is according to the

23

agency's own estimate -- billions of dollars.

24

That is --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

-- it's not binding at all.

tell you why it's legally irrelevant.

10

Let me give

First, let me address your

First, as a factual matter, they call

11

it just an internal instruction.

12

the contractors are the ones who make the final

13

payment determination.

14

is the hospitals submit a cost report form that

15

has all the data on it.

16

use the fractions from the agency, and they

17

then compute the final adjustment that the

18

hospital is owed.

19

The fact is

How this regime works

The contractors then

That is then a final binding payment

determination.

25

That's it.

That's how much the

If you don't do the administrative
appeal or sue in court, there's no doubt about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

it, it's in the reg, that is your final

2

determination of your legal right to payment.

3

Now, here --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

make sense if you've got -- I don't know

6

exactly -- I mean, how many of these interim

7

calculations do they have?

8
9

MR. SHAH:

But doesn't it

Well, when you're talking

about interim calculations for the DSH

10

adjustment, there's only two calculations.

11

There's the Medicaid -- Medicare fraction and

12

the Medicaid fraction.

13
14

That is it.

And -- and they compute that, and then
they give you a number for that adjustment.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

mean, how many every year or whatever the

18

payment schedule is?

19

they were using this to tell you how to

20

calculate what you owe, but not until the, I

21

don't know, the final bill comes in.

22

MR. SHAH:

I think in -Well, but, I

My -- my understanding is

Oh, okay.

So, just to

23

clarify here, so this is in the context of a

24

final payment determination.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

MR. SHAH:

So this happens once a

2

year.

At the end of the year, the hospital

3

will, after the year is closed, they'll file a

4

cost report form, and the agency will then use

5

that data, along with the Medicare fraction

6

that the agency has given them, and give them a

7

final total for that year.

8
9

So it's used to -- as a payment total
for the end of the year.

And then that

10

Medicare fraction is used, just the Medicare

11

fraction, is then used to compute the interim

12

payments for the next year until the next

13

fractions are issued.

14

So all of that is binding, however

15

that word is used.

16

statute.

17

that.

Obviously, it's not in the

But the hospitals are stuck with

That's their payment determination.

18

Their only recourse, of course, is to

They did that here.

22

23

authority to look behind the policy and

24

adjudicate this.

25

And here is what the
We are bound by the

That is, we lack the legal

The agency's own board says they can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

do that.

2

So for -- for the government -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then they're

3

wrong, because the SG is telling us that they

4

do have that power.

5

MR. SHAH:

Well, okay.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, therefore,

7

your complaint is to go to a court and say they

8

didn't do what they admit they were supposed to

9

do --

10

MR. SHAH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Well, Justice Breyer--- which is that they

treat the substantive matter --

13

MR. SHAH:

Justice Breyer, the

14

government made that exact argument to the

15

district court, and the district court found

16

that the board was right.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

They made that -That's what both of

18

these things seem to me to be somewhat side

19

issues.

20

the problem.

I understand why they give color to

21

MR. SHAH:

Right.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I accept that.

23

But the basic problem to me is whether or not

24

this statute, in using words like policy and so

25

forth, is saying:

Agency, when you have a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

legislative rule, which is defined as a rule

2

that establishes or changes a legal --

3

substantive legal standard, when you have that

4

kind of rule and don't hide it under a

5

statement of policy or some other way, when

6

it's doing that, use notice-and-comment.

7

Now, if you aren't doing that, you can

8

use notice-and-comment.

9

what you want.

You're more free to do

10

Now that's basically their argument.

11

MR. SHAH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

importance even beyond this area.

14

like you at some -- you know, to get to your

15

view on that.

16

MR. SHAH:

Right.

Sure.

That has considerable

Okay.

And so I'd

So, Your

17

Honor, that -- that argument makes no sense

18

because it goes -- it doesn't go any further

19

than the 1986 enactment that we've already

20

discussed.

21

And even under the APA, if you call a

22

legislative rule a ham sandwich, that doesn't

23

get you out of the notice-and-comment

24

requirement.

25

rule or a statement of policy, there is an

If you called an interpretive

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

exception for those, but if it's actually a

2

legislative rule, you have to go through

3

notice-and-comment.

4
5

So the government's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, yes, you know

that --

6

MR. SHAH:

Yeah.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and I know that.

8

But there are many, many people perhaps in the

9

United States, and including many who work in

10

agencies --

11

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, the --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- who don't know

13

that.

And so where it said in 1986 the word

14

"regulation," and then you read the House

15

report --

16

MR. SHAH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Yes.
-- then we arrive at

the same conclusion that it already said it.

19

But many people don't read House

20

reports.

And that word "regulation" might not

21

explain itself.

22

1987's law in order to put the House report, in

23

essence, in the law.

And, therefore, they reenact

24

MR. SHAH:

Well --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they show exactly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39

what they mean, okay?

2

MR. SHAH:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

on the other side.

5

MR. SHAH:

Well, a -That's the argument

Well, a couple responses.

6

If you want to ignore the text and look at the

7

House report, I would suggest we look at the

8

1987 House report, which is the one that led to

9

Section (a)(2).

10

And what it says there is we

tried this in 1986.

11

It turns out that the agency, and this

12

is a quote, "with growing frequency is enacting

13

significant" -- unquote -- is enacting

14

significant policies without going through not

15

-- notice-and-comment, notwithstanding our 1986

16

enactment.

17

sentence says, in fact, it's doing these things

18

through things like manual instructions.

19

And, in fact, it -- the next

And so what we are going to do is

20

enact a further requirement that even if it is

21

a rule, whatever type, interpretive or

22

legislative, a requirement or a statement of

23

policy, as long as it's actually affecting a

24

standard changing effect on Medicare providers

25

or beneficiaries, their legal rights, then they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1
2

have to go through notice-and-comment.
And -- and let me point out, let's get

3

back to the fatal flaw, which the government

4

has still not addressed in its statutory

5

construction, other than saying that Congress's

6

use of the word "statement of policy" is an

7

artifact, that essentially Congress made a

8

mistake when they enacted the statute because

9

it didn't change -- it didn't strike everything

10
11

out except legislative rule.
The statute here says any rule,

12

requirement, or statement of policy.

Now it's

13

not an artifact.

14

is the government's construction -- only things

15

that have the force of law can have a standard

16

-- can affect a substantive legal standard.

A statement of policy -- this

17

Well, categorically, as the government

18

says on page 16 its reply brief, a statement of

19

policy under decades of APA law categorically

20

lacks the force of law.

21

So Congress has now enacted a statute

22

that says any rule, requirement, or statement

23

of policy can trigger notice-and-comment,

24

except you could never have a statement of

25

policy that triggers a notice of comment.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Both

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

sides agree on that.

2

You are now reading significant words

3

out of a statute.

4

construction works.

5

That is not how statutory

Now the government says:

Oh, you

6

should just read this provision as simply

7

codifying the preexisting distinction between

8

substantive and interpretive rules in the APA,

9

the APA's interpretive rule exception.

10

Well, first of all, the term

11

"substantive legal standard" that they use in

12

(a)(2) appears nowhere in the APA or in any APA

13

cases.

14

extraordinarily round-about way for Congress to

15

try to adopt the interpretive rule exception

16

which is sitting on the books, instead to

17

introduce new language which has never been

18

used in the APA to duplicate the interpretive

19

rule and section.

20

So it would be an exceedingly,

Instead of introducing that novel

21

concept, if all that's what the -- what

22

Congress wanted to do in (a)(2), it could have

23

simply cross-referenced the interpretive rule

24

exception in the APA, just like it

25

cross-referenced the neighboring good cause

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

exception, or it could have simply said any

2

substantive rule requires notice-and-comment.

3

That would have been a lot simpler.

4

And yet, obviously, Congress didn't do that.

5

It did almost the opposite.

6

it expressly includes any rule, requirement, or

7

statement of policy, which, if you compare it

8

to the interpretive rule exception in the APA,

9

that expressly carves out any interpretive rule

10

It -- it took --

or statement of policy.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

meaning to legal, substantive legal?

13

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you give

So -Because that --

15

that's where the strongest argument, I think

16

your adversary makes, which is generally we

17

think of legal as binding.

18
19

So, if you can deal with that, I think
--

20

MR. SHAH:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

Sure.
-- everything else

you're saying falls into place.
MR. SHAH:

Sure.

So substantive legal

24

standard, how we -- how we would view it is a

25

legal standard is, obviously, a term that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43

used in law all the time.

3

It's this legal

And so, here, the legal standard in

4

their issuance is whether Part A entitled days

5

cover Part C days, whether they cover days that

6

are not covered under paid or covered under

7

Part A.

8

standard, the legal standard is the test.

So that's -- in substantive legal

9

Here, we obviously have a test, that's

10

what the whole 2014 issuance is doing, defining

11

when Part C days are covered.

12

legal standard.

13

So that's your

Now the question is, what work is

14

substantive doing?

15

substantive doing it, it's doing it in

16

contravention to procedural.

17

doubt here, everyone on both sides agree that

18

in that sense, substantive versus procedural,

19

what the agency did here has a substantive

20

effect.

21

dollars, it reduces the right of recovery or

22

reimbursement for these hospitals.

23

Well, then the work

And there is no

It's an effect towards billions of

Now what the government says, they

24

point to this D.C. Circuit case called AHA v.

25

Bowen, and they say Congress made this change

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

in the statutory language and added the phrase

2

"substantive legal standard" to reflect that

3

ruling.

4

Well, first of all, when Congress made

5

that change, it said we are clarifying the

6

statute.

7

wholesale change in the statute, which is what

8

the government's position is today at oral

9

argument.

10

It did not say we are doing a

It said it's clarifying the statute.
Second point:

That AHA v. Bowen case,

11

actually, substantive versus procedural is also

12

a distinction in the APA.

13

substantive rules, there are interpretive

14

rules, and there are procedural rules.

15

And what AHA v. Bowen says is

16

procedural rules, as opposed to substantive and

17

interpretive rules, also lack

18

notice-and-comment.

19

There are

And it draws the distinction between

20

substantive and procedural.

21

1045 to 1047 of AHA v. Bowen.

22

This is on pages

So even if we assume that Congress had

23

AHA v. Bowen in mind -- Congress is silent

24

about that in the House report -- but I'm

25

willing to take the government at face

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

value that --

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have any other

3

case that that might be when the conference

4

report says we're reflecting recent cases?

5

there anything else other than Bowen that you

6

think it might be referring to?

7

MR. SHAH:

Is

That -- that's the -- I

8

mean, we've looked.

There really isn't

9

anything that's on point of the ones that we

10

could find in that time frame.

11

obviously the one that the government focuses

12

on.

13

Bowen is

And we're happy to focus on that

14

because the core of Bowen is distinguishing a

15

procedural rule, things like enforcement

16

policies, auditing requirements on contractors,

17

how often you need -- the contractor has to go

18

and check the books of the hospital, those sort

19

of things.

20

It's distinguishing them from

21

substantive and interpretive rules.

And so in

22

-- in -- if that's what Congress was trying to

23

do, that makes perfect sense.

24

(a)(2) excludes procedural rules from its

25

ambit.

We agree that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

It says any rule, requirement, or

2

statement of policy that alters a substantive

3

legal standard, so what's off the table are

4

like the rules in Clarion; things that have to

5

do with enforcement policies, enforcement

6

priorities, anything that's procedural in

7

nature is off the table.

8
9

So it's completely consistent.
Congress used words that make sense.

They

10

departed from the APA.

And it's completely

11

consistent with the legislative history.

12

Now, if I could --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

What about the

practical --

15

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- the practical?

17

And the reason is practical is relevant is you

18

make a very coherent argument for one view

19

that, at one time, the D.C. Circuit waffled

20

between that a legislative rule was an

21

important rule.

22

And the other side of it is, no, it

23

might or might not be.

It is a legally binding

24

rule.

And the D.C. Circuit

25

tried your approach but then went back.

That was Davis.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

And the reason was practical, that

2

once you start to say, as you're reading this

3

statute, that what they're talking about are

4

important rules, you see, and that's why they

5

put in not just rules but statements of policy,

6

et cetera.

7

agency after agency, and at least here with

8

this statute, saying what in heaven's name is

9

that?

10

Once you do, you open the door to

You get into arguments about

11

everything, every word of a manual.

And if

12

they avoid that by applying this statute, to

13

everything arguably important in every manual,

14

they will be here 'til Christmas come.

15

And -- and, moreover, they will have

16

to make decisions in advance that they really

17

don't understand until later.

18

And your client, so they might be

19

happy with this case, may not be so happy with

20

a few of the others that take 19 years to go

21

through -- I'm exaggerating --

22

MR. SHAH:

23

MR. BREYER:

24

practical problem.

25

MR. SHAH:

Right.
-- but you see the

No.

Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:
you --

3

MR. SHAH:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

I do see your -That's why I want to

know the answer.

6

MR. SHAH:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. SHAH:

9

You don't see it or

I see your concern.
Yeah.

But here is why your

concern is misplaced here.

And let me give you

10

three clear reasons why, and these -- these are

11

important.

12

First, we've already talked about the

13

Clarian decision.

14

decision that actually applies the decision

15

here that they say is going to cause serious

16

problems for the administration of Medicare

17

Act.

18

There's one D.C. Circuit

The D.C. Circuit made clear they are

19

laying down a line, and that line is we're

20

going to take everything that has any anything

21

to do with enforcement priorities, auditing,

22

anything like that, so a large swath of

23

manual-type instructions, that was a manual

24

instruction in Clarian, off the table.

25

The second point, in its brief, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

government focuses on the provider

2

reimbursement manual.

3

all of this is going to require notice and

4

comment and -- and -- and raised some of the

5

concerns.

6

They say:

Oh, virtually

Well, the government still has not

7

provided a single example from that provider

8

reimbursement manual, so we took a look at that

9

provider reimbursement manual.

10
11

It's about

6,000 pages long.
The last 5,000 pages of it are

12

procedural instructions on how to fill out the

13

cost reimbursement form.

14

providers.

15

complicated tax return.

16

It's instructions to

That's kind of like an exceedingly

And so the last 5,000 -- and, by the

17

way, of those last 5,000 pages, a lot of those

18

are obsolete because they don't pull out the

19

old instructions.

20

to 21 to get to line 22.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

It tells you to add line 20
That means -But does the statute

22

apply only to provider manuals or does it

23

provide, say, let's say, to 320 or 240 million

24

Americans or 120 million Americans who get all

25

kinds of things from Medicare?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And perhaps thousands

3

of hospitals and thousands of services.

4

does -- if the statute's on just provider, you

5

have a good point, but is it?

6

MR. SHAH:

Well, the problem that the

7

government points to are these manuals.

8

what I'm telling you is the manuals --

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

No, and I'm pointing

to a different problem.

11

MR. SHAH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

How

Okay.
I'm pointing to a

question --

14

MR. SHAH:

So here --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- of whether this is

16

limited to provider manuals.

17

MR. SHAH:

So here's -- here's --

18

well, it's limited to the terms of the statute.

19

It has to be a rule, requirement, or statement

20

of policy that changes or alters a substantive

21

legal standard affecting one of the three

22

categories of things.

23
24
25

Right?

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you explained

away the -MR. SHAH:

A right to payment --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

away the last 5,000 pages of the manual.

3

MR. SHAH:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

You -- you explained

Yes.
But what about the

first thousand?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

So the first -- the

8

first -- the remaining 980 pages, of that,

9

40 percent are from before 1987.

(a)(2)'s

10

effective date applies to any manual --

11

anything promulgated after 1987.

12

that's off the table.

13

roughly 400 pages, Justice Alito.

14

So that --

That leaves you your

Of those, we went page by page through

15

those 400 pages.

16

about 35 of those pages, apply to the prior

17

cost reimbursement regime.

18

of how Medicare used to do those things.

19

those required detailed instructions.

20

All of about 30 -- except for

That was the regime
And

Now, however, the vast, vast majority

21

of providers are governed by the prospective

22

payment system.

23

those.

Only about 35 pages apply to

24

Now, even if 35 pages worth of stuff

25

needed to be done through notice-and-comment,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

although I'm quite sure the government can come

2

up with all sorts of arguments why those 35

3

pages don't fall under (a)(2), but even if you

4

did -- and here, Justice Breyer, this should

5

address your concern better than anything I've

6

said so far.

7

There is an annual prospective payment

8

system rulemaking that the statute requires

9

when it made this change from reasonable cost

10

reimbursement to this new regime, to which

11

there are only 35 pages applicable.

12

That annual prospective payment

13

rulemaking is hundreds of pages long.

And the

14

agency already puts everything governing

15

prospective payment systems that has a

16

substantive effect into that rulemaking.

17

In fact, 16 times before this case, it

18

adjusted the treatment of certain categories of

19

days through the prospective payment system

20

rulemaking.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. SHAH:

It says it governs

Well, Your Honor, a

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. SHAH:

Am I right or wrong?

First of all -- first, it

16

would cover it if it falls under the terms of

17

the statute, but here is why that doesn't

18

create a workability problem.

19

government has argued that.

20

And here's why.

And not even the

First of all, all --

21

a lot of that stuff is already done through

hundreds of pages long, includes all of the

take on average 102 days to put through an

We went

Now, to -- to address your other

10

question, a lot of that stuff is done through

11

regulation.

12

that you're talking about, is this -- is this

13

drug or treatment covered to the thousands of

14

people who might submit a Medicare claim,

15

that's all done through national coverage

16

determinations, local determinations.

17

those are all adjudications.

18

A lot of that stuff, the stuff

And then

There are thousands of those that are

19

done every day where the agency, a contractor

20

gets a Medicare claim.

21

on it.

2

MR. SHAH:

That doesn't implicate

(a)(2).

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have any

4

idea why this change wasn't put through the

5

ordinary rulemaking notice and --

6

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor, because

7

they tried.

8

through notice-and-comment rulemaking or tried

9

to do it through notice --

10
11

They did.

In 2004, they did this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
forgotten.

Why was that rebuffed?

12

MR. SHAH:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

Right.

So --

MR. SHAH:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I remember the

2013.

15

17

I've now

Yes.
But I don't

remember the -MR. SHAH:

Yes.

So what happened is

19

they did the proposed rulemaking in 2003, which

20

said, look, we want to codify our long-standing

21

policy and practice of excluding Part C days

22

from the Medicare fraction.

23

position as to how you should do this.

24
25

That's our

Then, in 2004, they did a 180-degree
turn but did not do any further

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

notice-and-comment, and they issued it as a

2

final rule to include the Part C days.

3

The D.C. Circuit in the precursor to

4

this case, what we call Allina I in the briefs,

5

said that's a logical outgrowth failure because

6

you've now flipped your long-standing policy

7

without any notice and comment.

8

So they tried to do it through

9

notice-and-comment, but because they got

10

rejected because of their defect in that

11

process, they then came to these -- they then

12

-- then they did the 2013 rulemaking, Justice

13

Sotomayor, that you're talking about, but, of

14

course, that's only going to apply

15

prospectively.

16

So then they were stuck while that

17

Allina I litigation was going on.

18

to 2013, they had those years that were not

19

covered by their new rule, because that had

20

been invalidated for the logical outgrowth

21

failure, and was not covered by the 2013 rule,

22

which only operated prospectively.

23

Between 2005

So, rather than doing a proper

24

rulemaking, they simply announced these on a

25

website.

They posted them on their website and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

said:

Now we are doing exactly the same thing

2

we were told that we tried to do in the 2004

3

final rule but was vacated by the D.C. Circuit.

4

So that's the answer.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess

6

the way the government puts it is they decided

7

not to proceed through rulemaking but to

8

proceed through adjudication.

9

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, as the

10

D.C. Circuit said, this looks nothing like an

11

adjudication.

12

on their website of including Part C days in

13

the Medicare fraction, that applies to every

14

hospital nationwide without exception.

15

prospective effect --

16
17

This policy that they introduced

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a big

adjudication.

18

MR. SHAH:

Well -- well, I think what

19

distinguishes the adjudication from the

20

rulemaking is, does it have general

21

applicability?

22

APA.

23

It has

That's the definition in the

And this, as the D.C. Circuit said in

24

its opinion, and the fact is the government's

25

counsel in the D.C. Circuit oral argument

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

conceded, when asked at oral argument, doesn't

2

this policy have effect to every single

3

hospital in the nation -- nationwide, and the

4

answer is yes, it does.

5

And not only that, it's prospective

6

because these fractions are used, again, for

7

every hospital nationwide to calculate their

8

interim payments for the intervening year until

9

the new fractions come out.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. SHAH:

12
13

Well, but --

So this looks nothing like

an adjudication.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- if it is --

14

well, I guess, again, I mean, we can hear on

15

rebuttal, but, I mean, it's an adjudication

16

where they're doing what you'd like to see

17

people do in adjudication, which is apply the

18

same rules to similarly situated parties.

19

MR. SHAH:

Well --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

happens to be a lot of them.

22

MR. SHAH:

Right.

There just

Well -- well, that

23

-- that would be fine.

But you can't issue a

24

-- a -- a policy that changes how you were

25

treating it and -- and have it have prospective

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

effect for every hospital nationwide without

2

complying with the terms of (a)(2), which says,

3

if you do any rule, requirement, or statement

4

of policy, you can't just give it a label that

5

says we're doing adjudication.

6

This has every effect of a rule,

7

requirement, or statement of policy in that

8

that treatment of Part C days, that is going to

9

decide the Medicare reimbursement amount, their

10

legal entitlement to reimbursement, for every

11

hospital nationwide.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So are --

13

you're saying this is not something that could

14

have been done through adjudication?

15
16
17

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, not in

the way -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the

18

agency could not choose adjudication as a means

19

of establishing this policy?

20

MR. SHAH:

Not as a means of

21

establishing it nationwide for every hospital

22

nationwide.

23

when they would do these things, they apply the

24

same rule to each hospital.

25

And the government has said that

So, no, if you're going to do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

something like this, then -- you could call it

2

an adjudication.

3

go through notice and comment when you're going

4

to be changing a substantive legal standard

5

that applies to them.

6

they can't now label this as adjudication.

That's fine.

But you have to

And so they can't --

7

Now, again, this is somewhat of a -- a

8

-- a -- of a theoretical question in this case,

9

because as the D.C. Circuit -- even the

10

district court, which ruled in front of the

11

government -- in favor of the government,

12

rejected their claim that this was an

13

adjudication and said this bears all the

14

hallmarks of a rule.

15
16

If there are no further questions, I'm
happy to sit down.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22
23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several things,

Mr. Chief Justice.

24

Subsection (e), by the way, was

25

enacted at a later time, and so its text

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

doesn't necessarily shed light on what Congress

2

did in 1987.

3

The term "rule" in the lead-in to

4

subsection (a)(2) includes statements of

5

policy.

6

it's superfluous there anyway, no matter -- no

7

matter how you read it.

8

imprecise.

9

So there's some redundancy or some --

So it is -- it is

The conference committee report in

10

1987, I want -- I want to stress this, again

11

says recent court rulings.

12

have been APA rulings.

13

Those could only

And, in fact, I -- I take my friend to

14

acknowledge that the American Hospital

15

Association case was the leading case, and that

16

case discussed the distinction between

17

substantive rules and both interpretive rules

18

and procedural rules, not just the one.

19

And as we point out on page 11 of our

20

reply brief, it did it in terms that are echoed

21

in the text of -- of hh itself.

22

APA's notice-and-comment requirement applies

23

only to substantive rules that create law --

24

which goes to Justice Sotomayor's point about

25

what does "legal standard" mean -- creates law

It says the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

and a -- "establish a standard of conduct"

2

which has the force of law.

3

language is very close to what -- what is in

4

the statute as enacted.

5

Those -- that

This is really the last program in

6

which one would expect Congress to have created

7

such a transformation of administrative law as

8

Respondents are proposing here, that

9

interpretive rules, such as manuals -- and the

10

provider reimbursement manual is not the only

11

manual.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But why -- why is

13

that?

In Chenery II, this Court did allow the

14

government to engage in retroactive

15

adjudications that affect substantive rights,

16

but expected that it would be a rare thing that

17

that would happen and that most of these kinds

18

of actions would happen through rulemaking.

19

This, of course, is the Court's -- the

20

government's claiming the power to affect every

21

Medicare provider in the country retroactively

22

through these seriatim adjudications.

23

-- why is this extraordinary?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why is

The Court addressed

that very situation in Guernsey Memorial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

Hospital, in which it said some things can be

2

done by regulation, some things can be done by

3

manuals, and some things are done by

4

adjudication.

5

And the agency -- and this is the

6

teaching of Vermont Yankee, the agency has to

7

have the flexibility to choose.

8

have the character of a -- of an adjudication,

9

going to the Chief Justice's question.

10

And this does

Yes, they sent it out to every

11

contractor performing on behalf of every

12

individual hospital, but that contractor's

13

determination for that -- for each of those

14

hospitals is an individual adjudication.

15

And the -- the application of this

16

fraction in that individual adjudication is not

17

binding.

18

the board or in court.

19

It -- it can be reversed on appeal to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you point to

20

anything in the history of the '86 bill or '87

21

bill that leads substance to your claim that

22

Congress was not, in fact, concerned about

23

substantive changes in formulas like this one

24

being done through rulemaking as opposed to

25

adjudication?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought in all

3

the history I read that was motivating them is

4

the agency's change of policy of doing less

5

than a rulemaking.

6

same but not less.

They wanted more or the

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

You may.

What Congress was

driving at -- and this comes from the word

10

"substantive," which has an established meaning

11

in administrative law and the APA -- was things

12

that have the force and effect of law, not

13

things that are simply interpretive.

14

the very distinction this Court drew in

15

Mortgage Bankers and in Guernsey Memorial

16

Hospital arising under this -- under this same

17

program.
