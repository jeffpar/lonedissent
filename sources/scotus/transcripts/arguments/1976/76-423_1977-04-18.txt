L .?: £ £ £ I. E £. £ £ S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 76-423, Puyallup Tribe against Department of Game
of tha State of Washington.
Mr. Rodgers, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. RODGERS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RODGERS:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

My name is William Rodgers.

I represent the

petitioner Puyallup Tribe in this case.

This litigation

returns hare for the third time in its 14-year history.
case involves a fishery for steelhead trout

The

in the Puyallup

River, Puyallup Reservation, State of Washington.

It has been

in the courts now for a period covering some four generations
of steehaad.

We believe that is long enough, and w© submit

that there is but on© issue left *— whether the State has the
power to regulate an on-reservation fishery.

This case does

not involve salmon; this case does not involve the Department
°f Fisheries; this case most assuredly do®s not involve
whether traffic lights will be honored in the streets of
Ta coma.
I will attempt to put the issue in context first
by outlining briefly the history of this litigation

and then

identifying the three propositions -that ws believe are decisive.
The action was commenced in the Pierce County

4
Superior Court back in 1963 against the triba and 39 named
individuals.

The litigation initially resulted in an injunction

restraining individual tribal members from net fishing for
steelhead in the Puyallup River.
The first time the case was hare this Court, viewing
the case as an off-reservation casa and therefore within
Article III of the treaty — I will be talking about the
treaty for the next several minutes.
Appendix la of our brief.

It is reprinted in

The first time the case was here,

this was viewed as an off-reservation case, and the Court
held that State strictures on Indian net fishing could be
justified only upon conservation grounds.
On remand for the first time we learned that the
Gams Department read conservation as permitting a total
prohibition against an Indian net fishery if you called it a
conservation ban.

Now, that position eventually resulted in

the case coming back her©.

This Court held in Puyallup II

that allocating all of the harvestable steelheads in the
watershed to the sportsmen could not be reconciled with the
treaty language of Articl© III.

Again the case was viewed

solely as an off--reservation case.
Now, before this case went to trial for the third
time, in June of 1974, two Federal decisions were handed down
in cases initiated by the United States involving fishing
rights of th® Puyallup Tribe and other tribes in the area.

5
Both of these cases were filed early in the 1970s, the first in
--970, the second in 1971»
Now, the first of these cases, United States v.
Washington,

involved virtually all aspects of treaty fishing

rights of the tribe in the western Washington region —
conservation, allocation, tribal self-regulation, and so on.
That decision, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, certiorari denied
here, is now being implemented with th© assistance of millions
of dollars of congressional appropriations.
Now, phase II of that litigation, scheduled for trial
next year, involvas claims by th© tribes, backed again by the
United States, of treaty entitlement to hatchery fish.

This

is basically now the litigation, involves all tribes, all
species, all of th© watersheds in th® case area, and also claims
with regard to environmental damage.
The second Federal case preceding trial her©, also
denominated Unitad States v. Washington, is th© so-called
Puyallup Reservation case.

Now, that case was initiated by

th®United States in 1971 directly in response to footnote 1
of this Court's decision in Puyallup I where fcha Court left
open th© question of whether th© reservation had been terminated
or extinguished.

That case was litigated on a complaint seeking

a declaration that the tribe had exclusive right to regulat®
the fishery within th© reservation.

It was litigated on a

60-pag© pretrial order containing a stipulation of facts

6
detailing the entire history of the reservation.

That litigation

resulted in a holding by the Unitad States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, again with certiorari denied her©, that the
reservation continuas to exist and that the tribe has a right
to fish free from State interference on the river within that
reservation.
Now, with this background, w© went to trial for a
third time, and we submit that three propositions ©merge

as

decisive of the single question presented in th© petition hare»
Proposition 1.
to exist.

The Puyallup Reservation continuas

This proposition,litigated in the Ninth Circuit only

a month before trial in this case, was conceded by counsel for
the State throughout th© trial, found as fact by th© trial
court, accepted as fact by the State Supreme Court.
Proposition 2,
fishery.

We ar® dealing with an on-reservation

Th© facts, again as found by th© trial court, recognized

and accepted by th© State Supreme Court, is that substantially
all of th© tribe8s future steelhead fishery will occur within
th® boundaries of the reservation.

Both of those propositions

established by the findings below.
Then V7-3 reach Proposition 3, which is decisive her®.
That proposition is found in Article II of th® treaty.

Article II

reserves for -the exclusive use of th© tribe th® reservation
properties ther© depicted,

including, of cours®, th© river,

which is directly within th© boundaries of the reservation.

7
We submit that Article II must b© read as reserving to the
tribe exclusive power and control to regulat® its own members
on reservation fisheries.
QUESTION:

I had thought your question presented

under writ of certiorari was that the State courts simply
lacked jurisdiction to hail the tribal court before it.

I get

the impression from hearing your last proposition that you ar©
talking more about the merits.
MR. RODGERS:

Am I wrong?

No, your Honor.

Both propositions ar®

presented hare, and w@ present them both in a jurisdictional
sens® and in a sans© with regard to the merits.

We do believe

■that the argument that I am submitting here, namely, a preemption
argument is basically a jurisdictional argument.

That is, we

:&®sl that Article II of hha treaty preempts from State
authorities any and all power to adjudicate and to regulat®
that on-reservation fishery.

So we read that as being juris­

dictional in that sens®.
QUESTION:

And would that extend to individual Indians

as well as tha tribe, if it depends on Article II of the treaty,
that preemption?
HR. RODGERS:

Your Honor, that would ba the case

except fch@r© ar© qualifications with regard t© individual
Indians, namely, other provisions of Federal law, perhaps the
Indian Civil Rights Act.

But basically we think that that

preemptive argument would apply to the individuals as well.

8

W© have here, of course, the second issue of sovereign,
immunity, which depends in. part upon that characterization.
Now, ultimately —
QUESTION:

You said proposition 1 is th© reservation

still exists and has not. been terminated.

And that, you say,

was accepted by th® Supreme Court, of th® State of Washington
in this case?
MR. RODGERS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, your Honor.

Could you tell ms offhand where in its

°pinion that factual proposition is accepted?
MR. RODGERSs

I cannot, your Honor, except that in

th® course of the opinion th© findings below w©r© accepted,
namely, that the Ninth Circuit reservation decision recognized
by th© State throughout as being dispositive on the status of
th® reservation was accepted by th® State Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Because in the first Puyallup cas© th®

Supreme Court of Washington indicated that the reservation had
fosan terminated and that was not decided by this Court in the
first Puyallup case.
MR. RODGERS:

That’s correct.

It would h© our position,

that that question earlier addressed in the cours© of this
litigation has been. waived both by the State by accepting the
Ninth Circuit and th©
QUESTION:

W© don’t have th® Ninth Circuit h©r®.

This comes from th® State of Washington.

9

*■

MR. RODGERSs
QUESTION:

That's right, but —

The Ninth Circuit decision was in a

different case, wasn't it?
MR. RODGERS:

That's right, your Honor.

Basically

w@ feel — your question may be whether it's a matter of law
of the cas© that the reservation does not exist.
QUESTION:

In this litigation, that is, as it began

a good many years ago, in the first Puyallup decision by the
Supreme Court of Washington the court held — you correct me
if I ara mistaken

that the reservation had been terminated.

MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.

And that holding was not disturbed by this

Court.
MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION:

Well, this Court —

W© said that what we are dealing with was

individual Indians fishing off reservation.
MR. RODGERS:

This Court, however, did indicate that

the question of th© reservation question was not being resolved.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. RODGERS:

This Court also indicated the same

proposition in the Sntlacum cas® fivs years later, recognising
the unresolved natur® of that proposition.

Then th© Federal

court1; litigation ensued.
QUESTION:

In a different cas©.

MR. RODGERS:

Yes, your Honor9 but we believe -the

10

acceptance of that litigation by State authority —
QUESTION:

That's rather important.

You said

proposition 1 was that the reservation hasn't been terminated
and moreover that that has been accepted in this case by the
buprem® Court of Washington.
it accepted it.

I am interested to know where

On the other hand, I don't want to tie you

up.
MR. RODGERS:

Yes, your Honor.

Well, in my rebuttal time I will address that.
QUESTION:

We ar© talking about suburban Tacoma,

aren't we?
MR. RODGERS:

The reservation boundary dees reach

suburban Tacoma.
QUESTION:

In fact, inside the city limits.

MR. RODGERS:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Of

course, there remains in the reservation lands in trust status,
and w® beliove that that characterization would apply as well
to the riverbed in th© case.
QUESTION:

You didn't present any question of r®s

judicata in your petition for certiorari, did you?
MR. RODGERS:

Your Honor, we believe that the question

of ras judicata is fairly within th© petition for certiorari.
QUESTION:

How do you explain that?

Look at your

question presented on page 2 of your petition where you say,
"Whether, consistently with established principias of tribal

11
immunity , a state court may adjudicat® on-reservation treaty
fishing rights of an Indian tribe and allocate the catch among
^ribal and nontribal fishermen.”
Mr. RODGERS s

W© heliev© that teat ought to b© read

as fairly embracing th© issue teat would b® dispositive.

And,

of course, in our petition —
QUESTION:

What do you mean by that, teat it ought

to be fairly read as embracing the issues teat ought to be
dispositive.

Dispositive of what?

MR. RODGERS:

Your Honor, th© res judicata issue,

we believa, because it does establish tea reservation, should
be recognised as binding and controlling in this case.

And in

fact in our petition we did address mid indeed argu© res judicata
in the body of the petition.
QUESTION s

Is your cohort or colleague going to argue

tee res judicata point or ar© you prepared to deal with it?
MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION 2

I am prepared to deal with that.

Res judicata in this case would just be

a matter of th® laws of the State of Washington, wouldn't it?
MR. RODGERS:

No, your Honor; w© believe it would

be a Federal question.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. RODGERS:

Because th® r®s judicata effect t© be

accorded teat Federal judgment, although not directly covered
by the full faith and credit statute, w® would present th®

12
Federal question, under principles

of basically the

Supremacy Claus©»
QUESTION:

Do you car© to articulate that, because

you certainly don’t spell it out in your brief at all.

You. are

not relying on 2817-38, ar© you?
MR. RODGERS;
that proposition.

No, your Honor.

That does not address

That is correct, w@ do not spell it out in

the brief, but. w© believe that the issue is a Federal issue.
QUESTION;

What is your authority for that?

MR. RODGERS;

As w@ cite in our reply brief, your

Honor -- well, w@ do not haws case authority for that poster©.
QUESTION;

Your argument is, though, that the State

of Washington was constitutionally bound by the decision of tee
Federal court -•
MR. RODGERS;
QUESTION;

— on an issue —

MR. RODGERSs
QUESTION;

That's correct.

On two issues.

—• under th© Supremacy Claus©.

MR. RODGERS;

That's correct.

On two issues; we

bsliave tee reservation status, and that w® believe was accepted
by th® courts below.

Th© second issue, th© question of tee

power to regulate on reservation, we believe is also a
Preclusive.
QUESTION;
for that proposition.

But you have no cases.

You haws no support

13

MR. RODGERS:

Wa cite ras judicata casas including,

in fact, —
QUESTION:

Yes, but you ar© not citing anything

which says that a State is constitutionally bound.
MR. RODGERS:

That is correct — no, w@ do cite a

case book in which that question is addressed.

It is a very

interesting question because the full faith and credit statute
doesn’t address it directly.
QUESTION:

You would hav© thought if Congress

intended to have that provision, -the full faith and credit
statute would hav© addressed it directly, wouldn’t you?
MR. RODGERS:

Not necessarily, your Honor, for the

reason that wa believe that it could well be argued that the
preclusive effect to b© accorded Federal judgments in light
of the Supremacy Claus© ought well to be governed by Federal
law.
QUESTION:

Would this Court be bound by that ras

judicata holding?
MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION:

Ah —

I mean, on the question of the reservation,

are we bound even if —
MR. RODGERS;

Your Honor,

x

would think that this

Court clearly, if it desired, could go on to decide the
reservation question.

I submit that would be unacceptable

here for a number of reasons.

First, the first time in this

14
litigation the status of the reservation has bean raised has
been in the State’s brief her®

Basically because they have

c°nc@ded, we have not addressed -the existence of th© reservation,
we have not addressed the host of material that is relevant
to that disposition.
Secondly, if indeed, let us say, th© Court war©
inclined to remand for a decision —
QUESTION;

For th© fourth time?

MR. RODGERS;

That would be my next point.

If th©

Court were inclined to remand, what wa would do again is to
plead res judicata, the Federal judgment, and you would then
have th© entire record of th® Ninth Circuit cas© back here
a fourth time and th® issue
Question:

That would be if w© took it.

MR. RODGERS;

That’s correct.

(Laughter.)
MR. RODGERS; More importantly, however, w© think this
2-s a decisive proposition.
QUESTION;

I would think if res judicata is what wa

are talking about, it would be the holding of the Washington
Supreme Court that th® reservation had been terminated that;
would be res judicata in this cas© involving the same parties
and the same litigation.
MR. RODGERS;

Well, I think not, your Honor, because

v/© submit, that is not th® law of th© case and it was recognized

15
as not: the law of the eas© by both the State in, the course ©f
litigation and by th© court ~
QUESTION:

You are going to tell us after lunch

where and how th© Washington Supreme Court has not accepted
the proposition that th© reservation has been terminated.
MR. RODGERS:

That is correct*, your Honor.

Let me say also that the decision

on — there is

no version of this reservation, however narrowly diminished,
■that would change the result of this case.

For that reason,

basically 'the —
QUESTION:

Unless th® reservation has been terminated.

MR. RODGERS s

That is th© only version that could

change the result of this case, and we say that because th©
river, part of th© original reservation, wa believ® to be
trust land and therefor® th© fishing is occurring on trust
t

land within that river, and therefore — and if th© reservation
hypothetically war© diminished to th© point that all that
remained war© th® tribe's agency tract, then ©van bn that
supposition, wa submit fchar® is total authority to regulate
the tribal fishery.
Now, I say total authority.
whether th© State has that power.

Th® issue here is

That issue, w© submit, has

b©@n conceded by th® State in litigation for 30 years.

Thor®

is no question hare about the Federal supervision that might
be imposed upon the tribe's regulation of this fishery.

Indeed,

16
th© Congress obviously could have a role to play here.

We

concede that under some circumstances th® Federal district
court might exercise jurisdiction over on-reservation fisheries,,
The same may be true of the Secretary of th© Interior.
Th@ question is whether th© State can exercise its
power and authority with regard to an on-reservation fishery.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you if it weren't for your

res judicata argument, would there be any other reason, would
there be any barrier to th© State's raising 'th© issue of the
existence of th® reservation in this case?
MR. RODGERS:

Simply for tha reason, your Honor,

that —
QUESTION:

It would support, the judgment.

MR. RODGERS:

That is correct.

A tarminafeion decision

her® would support the judgment below, that’s correct.

Th©

reason we say, of course, that it should not and could not b@
resolved here is -that th© record is not —
QUESTION:

It isn't an issue that was raised in th®

State court in this litigation, was it?
MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION:

No.

No, sir.

And th® State court has not addressed th©

question in this decision, has it?
MR. RODGERS:

Yes, the State court has addressed it.

Th©r® w©r@ findings of fact by tha trial court that the reserva­
tion continues to exist» that s©v©h miles of tha stretch of the

*

17
river is within, that reservation.
QUESTION:

Theses findings, incidentally

Were those findings reviewed in the

appellate court?
MR. RODGERS:

They ware reviewed, but that particular

finding, your Honor, with regard to the extent of the reserva­
tion is accepted by implication, but I think necessarily by the
four-judge concurring opinion which concludes that tills
fishery, substantially all of it, occurs within the boundaries
of the reservation.
QUESTION:

Now, that is accepted by the four judges Then except for the res judicata point,

you would say the State is entitled to argue the reservation
question.
MR. RODGERS:

No.

Well, I would say they are not

entitled for fch@ reason that they have never raised it before,
they have never given me an opportunity to respond to any
evidence * that 'they might present, they have never led n© to
believe that the 60-page stipulation of facts which is in the
Fadsral court record is to be contradicted and reconsidered
hare,

I would think that if that reservation issue were to

coma up, the necessary disposition would be a ramand, and as
I have indicated to an

earlier question from the Court, it

is perfectly satisfactory and easy, w@ believe, to recognize
that with the sol© ©xc@pt.ion of a termination decision, which
we don't think would conceivably be justified, the remand
would result in the same conclusion.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Rodgers, if you are right as to the

jurisdiction of th® State, where I take it it was without
jurisdiction whan the action was originally filed in s63?
MR. RODGERS:
QUESTIONS

No, your Honor.

When did it lose jurisdiction?

MR. RODGERSs

Th® initial action, although I am

shifting grounds slightly, the initial action was based upon
the supposition that we were dealing with off-reservation
fisheries and that w® w©r@ suing individual tribes.

I would

submit when it became clear that we were dealing with an onreservation fishery—that is basically th® status of th®
litigation in Puyallup III — when it became clear w© were
dealing with an on-reservation fishery,first, and secondly,
when it became clear that w© ware not -talking about a lawsuit
against individuals but rather a suit against th© tribe, on
two grounds, tin© Article II ground and on the sovereign
immunity ground, the State courts ar® without jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Was the tribe just brought in after remand

from this Court in Puyallup II?
MR. RODGERS:

The tribe has always been, in, your

Honor, but th® court orders do not go in the earlier litigation
to th® tribe in any particular.

The judgment and the order

in this cas© basically controls all aspects of tribal fishing.
And I use that "all aspects” advisedly.
tribe.

Th® orders g© to th®

They involvo reporting, allocation, closures, essentially

19
all there is to do with regard to fishing»

And that is the

significant difference between a case involving individuals
and a case involving the tribe and the sovereign status of th®
tribe, which, of course, is what is behind the sovereign
immunity doctrine,
QUESTIONS

What does the 6Q-'pag© stipulation have

to say about the status of th© reservation?
MR. RODGERS:

The 60-page stipulation goes into

considerable detail on th® entire history of th® reservation.
Do you wish me, your Honor, to address —
QUESTION:

What does it conclude?

What is th© effect

of th© stipulation on th© present —
MR. RODGERS:

Well, it indicates that a reservation

status decision, indeed as all of the reservation status cases
of this Court, have indicated, require a close look at th©
history of the reservation.

It r@qu.ires a close look at all

th® legislation, th© legislative history, department practices,
and so on.

One of th© facts in that stipulation is th© fact

that ever sine© th© Reorganization Act in 1936, both th©
Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice have
considered the Puyallup Reservation to be extant.

And we

submit, raor© importantly -Well, let me turn -QUESTION:
own the fishery?

Does th© stipulation show how many people

20

MR. RODGERS s

No, it: does not, your Honor.

The

record of this case indicates the numbers of tribal fishermen
and the extent of support.
QUESTION!

About eight or nine, wasn't it?

MR. RODGERS:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

In Puyallup II how many was it?

MR. RODGERSs

In Puyallup, I do not recall that there

were numbers of fishermen addressed there.
cas© indicates teat there were 60 fishermen.

The record in this
Their fishing

acti.vities support up to 150 members of the tribe, which is a
substantial percentage of the tribal membership.
QUESTIONS

There are 20 full time, aren't there?

MR. RODGERS:

Twenty full time, 20 part time, 20

occasionally.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR OBI BEHALF
OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FARR:
pleas© the Court:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Jus tic®, and may it
Th© Unitsd States is appearing this after­

noon in support of the position of the Puyallup Tribe in this
case?.

That position is that th© Puyallup Tribe and their

tribal members have th© right to fish for staalhead trout within
the confines of their reservation freo from State interference.
Now, this position self-evidently embraces two necessary
propositions.

First, that th©ra is a reservation, and, secondly,

that th© State may not exercise its power over Indian fishing
activities within it.
QUESTION:

And third, that th® fishing in this case

goes on on th© reservation, if any.
MR. FARR:

That the fishing that w® ar© arguing —•

QUESTION:

Th.® premis® of Puyallup I was -that these

were individual Indians fishing off
Mr. FARR:

th® reservation.

That i a correct.

And th® arguments that

I am discussing this morning do not dc«al with whatever Indian
fishing may occur off the reservation.

2 am simply talking

about fishing that occurs on th® reservation.
VVv.

I would like in view of the discussion this morning

22
to move directly to the question of whether th® existence of
fche reservation is properly an issue before the Court in tills
case.

Th© Stats has argued at length in its brief on the merits

that there is no Puyallup Reservation.
At th® outset we note that the State did not argue
this point at all in Puyallup III.

In fact, as the sipp@nd.ix

clearly shows, the State
QUESTIONS

You mean in th® States Supreme Court?

MR. FARR;

They did not argue it either before th©

Stats Superior Court or in th® Stats Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

In this case.

MR. FARR:

In this case, Puyallup III.

Th© appendix on paga 20 and 21 in fact indicates
that counsel for the State, for the Department of Gam®, said
that unless this Court overturned th© decision by the Ninth
Circuit in the reservation eas©

holding that th@r@ was a

reservation, that it would accept that decision.
Th® Washington Superior Court, in Puyallup III, on
peg® C-39 of th® appendix to th® petition for certiorari,
noted that this Court had denied certiorari in th© Ninth
Circuit case and stated that it would accept th© decision of
th® Ninth Circuit that there was a continuing Puyallup Reserva­
tion.
Now, th® Washington Supreme Court was a little bit
less specific, but on page B-6, B-7 of th© appendix to th®

23

p@tJ.fciOil for cartiorari, the Washington Supreme Court stated,
"It has also been contended that the recently established,
continuing existence of fclia Puyallup Indian Reservation —

This is th® Washington Supreme Court

It says, "It has also been contended that the recently

established, continuing existence of the Puyallup Indian Reserva­
tion" —* with a citation to th© Ninth Circuit cas© and this
Court's denial of certiorari — "precludes any state jurisdiction
over activities occurring within th© reservation boundaries."
Now, tli© Court does not then go on to comment on the
continued existence of the reservation, but then discusses
th® right to control fishing on th® reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, except the citation of Mafcfcz v.

Arnett necessarily goes to the question of whether or not th©
reservation continuas.
MR. FARR:

I disagree, Mr. Justice Stewart.

In this

cont©xt—Mattz: v. Arnett, of course, was a question of termina­
tion of reservation boundaries, but they ar@ -calking about
Mafcfcz v. Arnett- in this context not on that issue, but on th®
fact that the Court remanded, leaving open in their minds th®
question of whether @v@n though the reservation did still exist
in that case, whether th® State had some regulatory authority

within it.

That is th© page citation?

FARR:

QUESTION:

Or by any other court in this cas©»

MR. FARR:

In this case, it has not.

QUESTION:

So then is it not an open question?

MR. FARR:

W@ believe that it is an open question,

but. w® also believe it is net a question properly before th©

QUESTION:

In order to review an issue doesn't it

MR.* FARR:

Our position is that it has to b®

That is the language from Langles

% 289, it has to b© a matter of appearing in the record -—
QUESTIONs

If it is, even-: if it wasn't decided below,

th© respondent may -MR. FARR:

Th© court may ignore it.

For instance,

26
the State of Washington could have argued in this case that
there was no reservation and the State courts could have
ignored it, and we would believe in that case the issue would
be properly in front of this Court*

Or the State courts could

^ave said, 1SW© disagree."
QUESTION:

Th© trouble, Mr» Farr, is if we decide

the single limited question that is put forward in th©
petitioners' petition for certiorari, i.a., does th® State
have power to regulate on th© reservation fishing by Indians
who ara members ofl the tribe or reservation —
MR. FARR:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

— that would be nothing more than —-

however w© decides it "would b© nothing more than an advisory
opinion if there is no reservation.
MR. FARR:

Isn’t that correct?

Well, if there is no reservation in this

particular case, that is possibly correct.
QUESTION:

However, there is -

That is an advisory opinion.

If there is

advisory opinion.
MR. FARR:

There is a. separata question as to

whether in fact the riverbed is trust land over which th©
State has no jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

That is a separate, different question.

MR. PARS:

Well, it's a different question in some

respects, but

fch® same principles of jurisdiction would

27

probably apply.

So it would not necessarily mean if the Court

concluded there were no reservation that the State would have
jurisdiction to regulate in this cas®.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record which

would show me where the reservation is?
MR. FARR:

To show you where the reservation is?

My understanding is that there is not a. map in this record.

MR. FARR:

Well*, th© river runs through th© reservati.,on.

QUESTION:

Where?

What part of the river is through

th© reservation?
FARR:

I don't know precisely, but there is a

finding of the State Superior Court 'that a 7-mila stretch of
the river is within th© reservation.
QUESTION:

Ar@

point in th© river?
MR. FARR:

You ar® being asked to pass on a 7-mile

stretch of th® river which is within th© reservation according
to th© findings of fact of th© trial court.

28

QUESTION:

Which we don't: knew where it is.

MR. FARR:

Other than that, I don't know where it is,

that's right.

But I do believe that it is fairly embraced

within the reservation boundary.
Now, there was also considerable discussion this
morning about the r@s judicata question, and I would like to
address that just for a moment.

This is a confusing case

procedurally because w@ have litigation in th© State courts
and litigation proceeding at th© same time in Federal courts,
and the judgments between th© two courts are not necessarily
consistent.

In fact, they have tended to be inconsistent on

most issues.
Our position is that the judgment issued by Judge
3oldt, which did not concern th© existence of th© reservation
simply discussed th© right of th© State to regulate onreservation and vjhich concluded that the State did not have
regulation, as in fact tea State conceded and has conceded
throughout th® litigation in this case, and in fact conceded
before this Court numerous times in th© oral argument in
Puyallup II.

W© fcraXi.QV® that JudgeBoldt’s decision is binding

as a matter of ma judicata

or collateral estoppel on th©
*

State courts.
QUESTION:

Is your

position for that th© direct

authority of th® same cas© book that yourcolleagu© referred to
this morning?

29
MR. PARR :

Our authority for that is that that was

litigation b©tw©@n th@ same parties.

We ar© not relying on

^ha Supremacy Claus®.
QUESTION?

But r©s judicata ■— unless you are talking

about the Full Faith and credit Clause or about 28 U.S.C. 1730,
ras judicata is a matter of State law..

It's up to the State of

Washington to decide how much credence or faith it wants to
give to the decisions of courts -MR. FARR:

We think tli© Full Faith and Credit Claus©

does implement the r©s judicata.
QUESTION:

But it says nothing about Federal courts.

MR. FARRs

That is true.

I 'think that it does extend

more broadly than that, but if it doesn’t* then I do agree
teat the question of ras judicata is a matter of State law.
I do not think that is a matter of overriding —

The State did not address the res judicata

I would think that would be correct.
QUESTION:

Could the Federal court enjoin the State

officers from acting inconsistently with Judge Boldt.9 s decision?
MR. FARR:

State officers that war® parties to Judge

Boldt1 s cases? I believe it could,
QUESTION:

Including enjoining them from further

30

litigation in a State court?
MR, FARRj

I don't know.

I would think not, because

I don't think there is anything in the judgment that would
prevent further litigation of this matter in the Stats courts.
1 think that the order enforcing the judgment, any injunction
enforcing the judgment would not necessarily reach to
adjudication of different rights.

So I don't think that would

be the type of order that they would issue.
QUESTIONS

Aren't the State authorities asserting

rights contrary to what Judge Boldfcsaid they had?
MR. FARRs

They are asserting them in this litigation.

My understanding is they are not in disoboyance of Judge Boldt's
decision, or if they are, that that i3 being worked out in th©
Federal court.
QUESTION s

Could he enjoin them from further litigation

about these rights?
MR. FARRs

I don't know.

QUESTION s

Do you know of any cases in which th®

Federal court has enjoined th© State from proceeding with
litigation?
MR. FARRs

I don't knew of any, Mr. Chief Justice, no.

I would like vary briefly to discuss a point which
exists independently in this eas© regardless of our res j udicata
or collateral estoppel argument, and that is simply th© question
of State power to regulate on-reservation fishing.

W© do

31
believe that the State courts and the Department of Game in
this case found that power principally in the remand from this
Court in Puyallup II, which w@ think had nothing to do with it.
Puyallup II, as this Court has recognised, was an off-reservation
fishing case, and we see nothing in the remand which required
the State to take regulatory authority on reservation, or
xn fact authorised them to do so if they wouldn't otherwise
have jurisdiction.
2 should recede very slightly from a point mad® in
our brief.

On page 27 we indicated tha State of Washington

did not exercise general civil and criminal jurisdiction over
Puyallup reservation.

That statement is not completely

accurate, because it is too broad.

They have exercised

in a 1963 statute, general civil and criminal jurisdiction,over
Indian reservations within the State, with an exception for
Indian trust, lands and allotments, and also with a specific
©xclusion for matters affecting Indian treaty rights.
Now, tha State suggests in its brief, at page 47 now,
that somehow this may give them power.

But I think they would

fo® forced to concade that it’s a power they have never before
claimed under that Act and is a completely

about.

Is this jurisdiction under Public Law 23G?
Yes, this is Public Law 280 w@ are talking

Not over tills matter, clearly not over this matter, in

our opinion.

But th© City of Tacoma is not being run. by the

32
Indians.

I can b® run by the Sfcai:© of Washington under the

jurisdiction of the 1963 Act implementing Public Law 280.
QUESTION;

So your footnote 9 on page 27 is inaccurate.

MR. FARR:

It is too broad.

QUESTIONS

Inaccurate in that sense.

MR. FARR:

Inaccurate in that sensa, that’s right.

We sea no other independent basis of jurisdiction for
the Stats to exercise over on-reservation activitias.

w@

believe that the treaty of 1854, the Treaty of Medicine Creak,
quit© clearly gives the Indians exclusive rights to fish within
their Indian reservation, and w© don’t believe that has ever
^een challenged before by the State, and wa do not believe that
the State's challenges to it now are based on any solid
authority.

We think that the fishing rights are naturally of

great importance to the Indians.

They ar© now as they were

And we do not believe that they can ba limited by the

State simply because the Stat© wants additional fish for its
sports fishermen.

We ask the Court to so rule.

Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON S. WILLNER ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WILLNER:
the Court:

Mr. Chi©£ Justices, and may it pleas©

In this argument I will take 20 minutes. Attorney

33

General Gorton, of the State of Washington, will take 25
minutes.

We have attempted to make an allocation among us by
#

subject matter to the extant we can.

I am going to be talking

about conservation, about the exclusion of hatchery fish,
about the res judicata concerns.

Mr, Gorton will be talking

about sovereign immunity, the reservation which has bean
considered in many of the questions her®, and also the problem
of allocation.
Both of us will be essentially saying to the Court
that what the Supreme Court of Washington did was very faithfully
carry out the mandate of this Court that this Court in Puyallup II
sent this cas® back to the Supreme Court of Washington and
through them to the trial court to do thra® things s
First of all, to determine whether hatchery fish,
which are paid for by sports fishermen, are excluded from the
treaty and from the treaty fishery.
Secondly, to determine a plan for implementation and
a plan for regulation.
And third of all, to determina a fair allocation of
the fish between the sports fishermen and the treaty Indians
which in your words in Puyallup II accommodated tee rights
of the Indians with, the rights of the other people.

And it

is ©ur position teat is exactly what tea Supreme Court of
Washington did through an extensive trial, through a decision
of teat court, and wa ares here seeking affirmance.

34
Now, I should briefly state who I represent before
I ~
QUESTION?

Before you proceed, it seems to ms that

the question presented by the petition for certiorari in this
case is a question that exists quit® apart from the existence
of any treaty or the meaning of any treaty.

It simply has to

*

do with whether or not the State of Washington or any State
may adjudicate on-reservation fishing rights of an Indian tribe.
Isn't that right?
MR. WILLNERs

Your Honor, it3s ©ur position that if

You look at that question, that everything we want to discuss
with this Court flows from that single sentence.
talks about tribal immunity.

That sentence

We propose to talk about that.

That deals with, the question of whether the State was regulating
the rights of individuals.
treaty fishing rights.

It talks about on-reservation

And, of course, it is our contention

that the hatchery fish ware excluded from tee treaty, that they
are entitled to —
QUESTION?

MR. WILLNSRs

land of th© Puyallups. It talks about Indian ‘tribe, and it
talks about who this action is against.

It talks about

35
allocation.

That again deals in matters we want to talk about.

So essentially what I am saying in response to your
Honor's question is in our effort to defend the decision of the
Supreme Court of Washington*, everything we want to talk about
is raised in this single sentence* and also — now* I respectfully
suggest to the Court that we would vary much like to get these

questions

I am very much aware of that.

MR. WILLNERs

Yes.

Thereafter, JudgeBoldt, in a case

in which my clients ar© not parties -- incidentally w® sought
intervention and war® denied.

After the remand of this case

in Puyallup II* Judge Boldt has gone into soma but not all of
these questions.

Whan X say some but not all* Judge Boldt in

that decision in February 1974 said that h® would initially
defer to the State court on this question of exclusion of

36
hatch@ry fish, because of .th® mandat© of this Court.

And then

after the decision of th© Stat© Supreme Court in our favor,
Federal Judge Boldtin a case in which w® were not a party, issued
an injmiction against the State of Washington enjoining thorn
during th© pendency of his case from distinguishing hatchery
fish and said that h® would not give res judicata effect to the
decision of th® Supreme Court of th© Stat® of Washington on
th® very issue before some of th© same parties.
QUESTION:

The United States brought th© action before

Judge Boldt and th® United States wasn9t a party in th® Supreme
Court of Washington, was it?
MR. WILLNERs

No, your Honor.

Th® United States

defended th© Puyallup Trib© throughout th® later part of this
litigation.

If we gat into technical res judicata areas, we

contend had th© laboring oar.

But no, they were not parties.

Th© United States represented

th© Puyallup Trib® in this case

in th® trial court, through th© United States Attorney, but, no,
they were not parties.
1 think, your Honor, just a couple of things I do want
ho say preliminarily.
QUESTION:

I wonder if you would say —

MR. WILLNERs
QUESTION s

I b©g your pardon?

I started to say whom ar® you representing?

MR. WXLLNER:
fisherman ©f Washington.

I am here, your Honors, for tee sports
I represent th© largest sports fishing

37
group in th® State.

There ar® 150,000 sports £ish@rxa@n in

th® State of Washington.

Their interest in this case is

primarily in tha ar®as I am going to discuss, which are
conservation of the fishing resources and th© exclusion of th®
hatchery fish from th© treaty fishery.
Now, 1 think th© Court — w© ar@ long way from tha
rivars of th© State of Washington and from anadromous fishery.

I think th© Court understands from th© previous cases that
basically steelhoad ©re anadromous fish, that many of them
are propagated in hatcheries, artifically propagated in
hatcheries, something that was unknown at tha time of th© treaty
1855, that on this river — and this is something that has
b@®n developed in this record, which you sent us back to
determine — on this river, on th© Puyallup River, almost th©
entire cost of tins hatchery operation is paid for out of
dedicated funds of 'til© Department of Game, earmarked or dedicated
funds, and tha finding is virtually entirely all of those funds
for th® steelhead operation cam© from the sports fishermen.

The

sports fishermen not only paid for these hatchary fish with
their license fees and tags T

th® record also shows

wa have

9on© out and dc-n© voluntary work, w© have planted fish, w© hav©
enhanced th® run, we have worked on th© habitat.
many things.

We have done

It's our basic contention, and the reason why my

clients have sent m® on the plan© to com® back to Washington,
D. C., is to essentially respectfully say to this Court that we

38
really hav® an equitable interest in these hatchery fish along
the lines of th® concurring opinion by this Court in this
ease in Puyallup II, which has now been amply demonstrated
by the record that has been mad® through a 10-day trial# and
this was on® of the bases
decision.

of the Supreme Court of Washington8s

It had several bases.

It said first of all that

th© hatchery fish equitably belonged to those who paid for
th®m with earmarked funds.
Secondly, it interpreted the treaty, and it said
■^hat in 1855 no one could have contemplated a hatchery fish
operation, that it could not have bean intended.

And then it

looked at a particular part of that treaty where the treaty
talks about the exclusion from th® treaty fishery of shellfish
that ar@ State or cultivated by citizens, and th© Supreme
Court of Washington said this is a very good indication that
if anybody had known about hatchery fish, they would hav©
excluded them because they excluded another form of marina
lif® in which there was th© effort and industry of citizens
put into' developing the resource.
So tli© first point that I really want to make to this
Court, is that the concurring opinion of this Court in Puyallup II
which thtee-members of th© Court put in your opinion and the
\
majority did not disagree with.
Th© majority said tills may be
the is.su© teat will be

a

basis for the remand.

We went back and triad teat issue.

We proved to the

39
satisfaction of the trail court, to th® satisfaction of the
Suproir© Court of Washington that hatchery fish are identifiable.
w® proved also ■— and this is something that my colleague tells
me was not made as clear as it could bs in the brief, and that
is the only fish that we claim are hatchery fish ar© -fell©
first generation, those that ar© propagated in the hatchery,
fcecaus© they can, be identified by dorsal fin damage; teat all
the progeny of the hatchery fish ar® counted as natural run
and w® ar® happy to have them counted as natural run.

So no

matter what you do, there is a subsidy that the sports fisherman
are doing to help the treaty Indian fishery.
But in terms of the first generation hatchery fish,
which ara put in that river du© to our money and our industry
and our effort, our first point respectfully is that the
Supreme Court of Washington should b© affirmed when it says
that those fish are excluded from th® treaty fishery.

And if

they ara excluded from th© treaty fishery, whether or not there
is a reservation,
them.

w©

should not ba prevented from having

though you may fo© absolutely right as to your interpretation

excluded.
MR. WILLNER:

Wall, if your Honor pleas®, th© basic

answ®r to that question is,the reason why th© State Supreme

43
MR. WILLNER:

Wall, if your Honor pleas®, the reason

wily w® think it's put in is because if we are defining their
treaty fishing right, we say that their treaty fishing right
excludes the hatchery fish, and they have asked this Court
to Safina their treaty fishing right.

Even if you are

defining their on-reservation treaty fishing —

No.

what I am saying is if they say that what we are only concerned

You are not talking about specific fish

You must be talking about a fair allocation.
MR. WILLNER:

Your Honor, on© of my clients claims

that he can tell the difference between a natural fish and
a hatchary fish by the fight on the line.
won't go that far.

Most of them

But what's in this record is that the

hatchery fish can be identified after they are caught, and
they can be allocated by numbers because, after all, what the
treaty Indians are concerned with — it's a commercial fishery
that they are concerned with, and you cem make a fair
allocation by numbers.

Exactly.

So that’s what you are really

talking about.
MR. WILLNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

I had one question, Mr. Willner.

After

a hatchary fish is caught by a sports fisherman, he treats it
just like any other fish?
MR. WILLNER:
QUESTION:

H© certainly does, your Honor.

So there is no regulation in terms of

whether it is hatchery or not when you are talking about your
own people, the non-Indians?
MR. WILLNER:
QUESTION:

You say regulation, your Honor.

Is there any significance to the fact

that a hatchery fish can be identified after it's caught?
MR. WILLNER:

The significance which w© think is —*

45
and which is what most of th© quarrel is about — was it's
a way of making a fair allocation, that if it can be determined,
as the trial court did after 10 days of trial, that the hatchery
fish ar® identifiable, you can therefore debarmine th©
percentage of th© hatchary run and th© percentage of the
natural run.

You can therefore make an allocation which is

in accordance with th© -treaty.

You can exclude the hatchery

fish from th© treaty and still give the treaty Indians a
fair share of the natural run.
QUESTION:

But by excluding them frora th® treaty,

You ar© really excluding a percentage of th® total run,
rather than specific fish.
MR. WILLNER:

Yes, w© ar©, certainly.

excluding is a percentage of total run, that is

What w© ar®
the percentage

that w© paid for by paying virtually the entire cost of the
hatchery program into th® gam,® fund and that paid for hatcheries.
QUESTION:

But for purposes, once they ar@ in the

river they ar® treated as fungible fish and they ar© all alike
after that.
MR. WILLNER:

Yes, they ar®, your Honor.

A couple of things I do want to say to the Court on
my time.

First of all, on this question of just a few things

that counsel said, though Attorney General Gorton will b@
talking more about tin© question of th® contentions of the
Puyallup Tribe.

46
Counsel for the Puyallup Tribe said her© today in this:
courtroom this morning that the tribe concedes that for some
purposes the Federal courts may regulate the reservation fishery
as if to say to this Court that the State doesn’t have to# he
concedes the Federal courts can do it.

But unfortunately for

his position# in a pending case before the Ninth Circuit in
a brief written nine months ago# which has not yet been argued#
the Puyallup Tribe# through the same counsel 'that just addressee
you# has written a brief in which they talc® the position that
the Federal courts cannot regulate what they call a reservation
fishery.

On page 30 of counsel's brief in this case of United QUESTIONS

You'r® not going to argue that case’s

MR. WILLNER:

I beg your pardon?

You're not going to argue that case’s

res judicata# too.
MR. WILLNERs

No# your Honor.

I am arguing that

•fcher© is an inconsistency in his position hers which I feel
should be brought to the attention of this Court.
QUESTION?

Well# there have been some inconsistencies

on both sides# haven't there# since 1963?
MR. WILLNERs
QUESTION?

Your Honor, none on ours yet.

You haven't been in it long enough yet.

MR. WILLNER3

I agree.

I want to talk briefly about a couple of things
hg&in on the facts.

There is som© implication, again, in the

brief of counsel for the Puyallup Tribe, there is some
implication that there is a heavy commercial fishery on these
st®elhead before they get to Puyallup River,

Counsel says,

for example, on pag® 10 of his brief, "Stselhead also are
caught in Washington waters incidental to the commercial catch
of salmon,"

deals with the Columbia River, not with Puget Sound, not with

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENTS
GORTON s
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas®

I perhaps should address myself first to a question

which Mr. Justice Stewart just asked of my co-counsel in this
case.
Mr. Justice Stewart, the order of the presentation
on hatchery fish would be this:

First, that hatchery fish are

not subject to treaty rights at all.

Therefore, Public Law 280

does not save the reservation even if it exists from Stata
jurisdiction because the State is prohibited jurisdiction on
such a reservation only in connection with treaty fishing
rights, and if these are not treaty fishing rights, they are
Ilot protected from 3tat© jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I seem to have missed it, but why are

they automatically not included in th© treaty?
MR. GORTON:

That’s th@ issue in this case, your

Honor.

Throughout these entire proceedings the State has

It seems to m@ there are two quits independent theories which

One is that they
An independent reason

is that they were paid for by the license fees.

Would you

contend that if th© license fee money had been used to improve
water quality in som© way which enlarged th© run that a portion
of th© fish would not ba covered by the treaty?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Enlarged th© natural run?
Yes, enlarged th© natural run.

MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

I would not mak© that contention.
So it is not a question of wh@r«i th© funds

com© from? it’s a question of it’s fish that are artificially
added.

It doesn’t really matter how they ar® paid for, I

iguass;, them.
MR. GORTON:

Well, it's a question of where th©

funds com® from in the sens® that these funds were used to
croat© a run which is an addition — it is shown by th© record
to b© an addition to the maximum natural run.

If it war®

simply State funds to improve river quality, no.
QUESTION:

What if they were simply general revenue

funds that were used to subsidize a new development of a breed
of fish, or something Xik© that.
MR. GORTON:

You would still say —

Under those circumstances, we would make

the same claim.

It

H® emphasizes that because

he represents the people who pay the fees.
QUESTIONS

May be critical to his standing to be here,too

MR.GORTONs

It may.

We have asked in Puyallup III for a declaratory
judgment stating our authority to enforce reasonable conservation regulations upon individual members of the tribe.

Now,

in addition, th© trial court did grant two elements of limited
relief against the tribe itself, and this seems to be the
whole basis of the claim that you must dismiss the entire
litigation.
First, it required the tribe to file a list of the
names of authorized tribal fishermen, hardly an onerous task.
And, second, that it supply weakly catch figures during the
course of the season.

It's raally only on the basis of these

additional elements of relief that the tribe seeks dismissal
of the entire action on sovereign immunity grounds, claiming
that this is destructive of tribal self-government.
Even if th® Court finds that this rather incidental,
specific relief is barred by sovereign immunity, it is
certainly not precluded from dealing with th® merits of the

53
decision which it directed the Washington Supreme Court to
make and from affirming th® enforcement of -those decisions
against individual tribal members, it seams to us.
QUESTION;

Mr. Gorton, do you understand your

opponents" sovereign immunity contention to be that you
simply cannot bring the tribe into court, th© Superior Court
of th© State of Washington,for whatever purpose, or more like
NLRB preemption type of thing where because Federal lav/,
such as th© Treaty of Medicine Creek, is involved, a State
court can't pass on it?
MR. GORTON:

It is clearly th© former, your Honor,

by reason of the argument which Mr. Willner referred to that
these sam® counsel ar® now making in the Ninth Circuit that
Federal courts have no jurisdiction either.

In other words,

in direct defiance of the 9-judge opinion in Puyallup II

it

is the essential legal claim of th© tribe that they do have
the right to pursues th© last living steal ha ad into their
nets and that no court, Stata or Federal, has any right to
interfere with that activity.
QUESTION s

Wall, they concede that th.® United States

could bring a suit against them.
MR. GORTON:

No, they do not conced© that th© United

States could bring a suit against them.
that -the Congress can change the law.

They conced© only
But their position today

is that you cannot control their fishery, ©van if th® United

MR. GORTON:

No.

My colleague here was reading from

I am sorry.

The question of the existence and extent of the
reservation has been raised.

I wish to preface my comments

on -that subject by stating that it has been the consistent
i

position of this Court, and may very well be the strongest
«
single law of th© case argument that the existence or non­
existence or extant of this reservation is simply irrelevant.
If you will look —
QUESTION: That is perhaps a misapprehension.

Th©

court in Puyallup I which in the course of its opinion said
we don't need to foe concerned with the existence or nonexistence of th© reservation because this case involves fishing
by Indians off th® reservation.
MR. GORTON:

I think your decision in Puyallup I,

Mr. Justice Stewart, went considerably further than that.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court ssiy something along

those linas in th® course of its opinion?
MR. GORTON:
©Is®.

It did so.

But it also said something

It dealt with, th® fact that the Washington Supreme

Court had found th© reservation to b© terminated and even set
out soma of the seasons which th® Washington Supreme Court

55
utilized.

It then went on to say that you did not need to get

to that question because the only fishing rights which the
Puyallup tribe had were those which it had received under
Article III of the treaty# which is the usual and accustomed
places in common with all citizens of the territory language.
And, therefore, the implication was that it didn't make any
difference.

Their on-reservation rights and their off-reservation

rights were the same.
Now, in the first two cases which this Court considered
on this kind of treaty — remember there are a dozen or so
treaties in Washington and Oregon with similar language, all
mad© in the Seim© year or year and a half period — dealt with
tli© Yakima

Tribe in both the Winans case and the Tulee case.

The treaty in those cases has a separate and explicit exclusive
on-reservation fishery right in it, which the Puyallup treaty
does not and which presumably was th© reason that Mr. Justice
Douglas, writing for this Court in Puyallup I.stated that only
Article III was relevant.
QUESTION s

Why do you suppos® —■ what was the purpose

,

since I have already interrupted you, of th® first larg® section
of th® opinion of th© Supreme Court of Washington in this case
giving its view of how th® treaty ought to b© construed, a
view in conflict with th© construction of Puyallup I?
MR. GQRTGNs

You effectively have three allocation

formulas that ar© involved with fisheries on th® Puyallup at

56
this point.

You have Judg© Boldt* s , which has been described

here by tha Solicitor's Office.

You have the trial court's

distribution, 45 percent to the relative handful of Indian
fishermen, 55 percent of the natural run to the other citizens
of. ‘the State, which our Suprema Court has affirmed.
affirmed that with a troubled mind.
this Court in

But it

It felt that it had misled

Puyallup II in indicating that there was any

apportionment required at all.

You found in Puyallup II

that in til© portion that was required because a non-Indian
sports fishery entirely preempted fch® run, that wasn't true
then, and it's certainly not tru© in th© record now.

The

Indians have th® right to a sports fishery, a slightly better
right than non-Indians because they need not buy a license
for it.

In fact, they engage in th® sports fishery.
So the State Supreme Court is asking you in addition

to tall whether or not the language, the right-to-fish language
in common with all citizens requires an apportionment at all
irHen there is nt discrimination and when th® access to and th©
rights to the fish are the same for th® Indian group as they
are to th© non-Indian —
QUESTION:

Under its construction of th® treaty

no net fishing would be permitted at all by the Indians.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTIONS

That, of course ■—
What was the function and purpose of that

law and th© interesting part of th© Supreme Court of

57
Washington's opinion, do you suppose?
MR. GORTON:

I think in order to persuade you that

your decision in Puyallup II was incorrect

because you didn't

have the facts in front of you.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Or Puyallup I.
In Puyallup I you did not require an

It was not until Puyallup II that you —-

QUESTION:

But it did construe it to allow net fishing,

didn't it?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, I missed your question.
Didn’t Puyallup I construe the treaty to

allow Indians to fish by net?
MR. GORTON:

Puyallup I did not construed the treaty

in that respect at all, because the State Supreme Court in
Puyallup I

had already vacated the trial court's judgment on

allocation.

And so you had no allocation in front of you in

Puyallup I, and you quite specifically stated that you were
not going to attempt in Puyallup I to say whether an allocation
was required.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

All right, now ~
In Puyallup II you did so.
You have explained now your understanding

of why the Supreme Court of Washington wrote that part of its
opinion.

Are you trying to persuade us along the same linea?
MR. GORTON:

I am.

And there is a considerable

58
section of our brief which is devoted vary precisely to that
argumenti, because w© feel, as the Supreme Court of the State
of Washington did, that our record was incomplete

and our

State Supreme Court mad© a misstatement in its decision in
Puyallup II which led you to feel that there was discrimination,
that only non-Indians could engage in the sports fishery and
that therefor® an allocation or apportiorunent was required.
That is simply not th© case, and this record shows
that not to b© the case.

They do in fact ©ngag© with others

in a sports fishery.
The next that I was going to before your series of
questions began was th® question of the reservation itself.
Now, the question of the reservation itself is a somewhat more
narrow one than you hav® bean led to believe by counsel on th©
other side of this case.

Even if w© don't conced© that you

can't even deal with tbs termination question at all because
of what th© Ninth Circuit said, all th© Ninth Circuit said
was 'that th® reservation hadn't bean terminated.

In spite of

th© statements by counsel on the other side, there was no
fishing rights issue in that cas© whatsoever.

It was solely

on whether or not there had been termination.

As it started

there was an alternate claim by th® State that there, had been
termination or diminishment.
there had been termination.

Th© district court ruled that
Three years ago the Ninth

Circuit reversed and said there had not been determination and

The United States has not pursued that case.
doesn’t ©v©n have a judgment on it yet.

It

But it certainly has

not pursued any attempt to say what is included within the
reservation.

This Court in Puyallup I effectively

said what

is included in the reservation — 20 acres of the cemetery.
Mr. Justice Marshall asked about where the reservation is,
and 'the former, or the supposed reservation is shown in the
map which is at the back of our brief.

The lines on that map ■—

unfortunately since it’s a transcription of a color map there
is soma difficulty with it, but all th© lines that are lightly
cross-hatched is the som© 18,000 acres which was originally
in the reservation back in the middle of the 19th century.
Th© heavier lines are the city limits of th® City of Tacoma,
the City of Fife, and there is a portion of the City of
Puyallup and other suburban areas within that supposed
reservation.
But there has b©.©n no determination in th© Ninth
Circuit that the river is in fell© reservation or that anything
is in the reservation.
QUESTION:

There is a description of th© Ninth

Circuit opinion th© brief of feh® United States.

”As a result, the Court indicated, tribal members

QUESTION:

MR. GORTON:

because the Ninth Circuit in a very, very short decision simply
stated -that th© reservation had been terminated.

MR* GORTON:

No, I do not believe that there was.

Th®r© has boon in the appeal from the decision by Judge BoJdfc,

MR, GORTON:

I believe that that is correct, that

he mad© such a decision, though that was not a matter which
was argued before him, it was not a general subject of that
set of proceedings.

But nonetheless, this Court, before he

made that decision, remanded this case to the State court to
make just such determinations, which it has, of course, gone
on and don®.

Judge Boldt, incidentally, if you read his

62
entire decision, takes the Puyallup I and Puyallup II casas
and says in effect that you were wrong, although he gives lip
service to following it, and uses a totally different
apportionment formula than that which you set out in Puyallup II.

back in Puyallup I, and there is th© evidence in th® decisions
of th© U.S. district court and th© court of appeals.
-ia feel that this case being her© for th© third
time, -that all of th® issues involved

in a decision of th®

Court are properly before you and that you ought to decide it*
Thank you vary much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?.

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Rodgers?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. RODGERS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RODGERS:

May it pleas® the Court, in direct

response to Mr, Justice White, th® position of th® State with

67

regard to the reservation question is as follows.
reading from pages 20 and 21 of the Appendix.

I am

"We tax© the

position first that we have to operate on the premise that
there is a reservation unless the United States Supreme Court
grants certiorari on that decision and reverses the same.
that question can only be resolved by that format.

And

And the

£aiiur® to take certiorari or taking so failure to overturn
the Ninth Circuit the reservation is there and we must observe
it.

But what w@ are asking is, first" — I am reading further

to indicate to the court —
t

QUESTIONS

What are you reading from?

MR. RODGERS:

I am reading from the Appendix,

pages 20 and 21 — the joint appendix, your Honor.

I am reading

further with regard to the natural hatchery issue.

This is

-rom counsel's opening statement before the trial court in
Puyallup III.
"What we ar@ asking,first, by this court is to detarmin® that there is a distinction in terms of the treaty right
between natively propagated stealhead and those which ar©
hatchery planted.

Now, 'that concept, sines we only have

jurisdiction off "-reservation-—is only material to tee offreservation fishery."
Her© we have an on-reservation fishery? the natural
hatchery question is not presented.

Th® entire question of

treaty entitlement to hatchery fish is presently pending

68

before Judge Boldt.

My proof on this question, if I did bring

it hare, was curtailed repeatedly by exclusions of evidence
in a non-jury trial dealing with competition between natural
and hatchery fish, environmental damage*

For example# the

position of the State on this question is that if simply the
run were destroyed, the natural run wera entirely destroyed
and replaced by a hatchery run, then basically th©r© is no
more treaty entitlement to that fish.
Secondly, on th® sovereign immunity question, the
Attorney General has understated th® issue substantially.
Basically on the sovereign immunity issue, if this Court
a£firms, you am. opening up litigation against a tribe to
allocate and apportion its natural resources in States courts
throughout the State of Washington.

Th© Congress has never

Permitted such a lawsuit, and 2 submit that if there is an
affirmance on that sovereign iramunity proposition, the effects
would b© devastating,
QUESTION:

Would that not b© limited, ©v©n if we

tak© your assumption, limited to casas where tear© is an
artificial input —
«

MR. RODGERS:

Absolutely not.

Again in responso

to Mr. Justice White’s question, I believe# the sovereign
immunity defense would apply regardless of th® nature of th®
claim.

They ar@ suing th© tribe# and they have secured orders

against tee tribe,

Th® so-called petty orders include directives

©
to th© tribal council to close fisheries under threat of
contempt.
QUESTION?

What is th© allocation now to th©

Puyallup Indians?
MR. RODGERS;

Th© allocation issue is as follows?

Basically , off reservation the Boldt decision indicates a
5o-50 allocation question. Th© court b©low allocated on a
45-55 basis.

For our purposes that’s insignificant.

There is a further question of whether th© hatchery
fish are excluded.

Presently, under a Federal court order,

Pending adjudication of this entire question in phase two of
United States v. Washington, the State is enjoined from
excluding hatchery fish from its regulatory activity with
regard to all runs, including the Puyallup River.

Now, that

meant, again in response to another question, that there indeed
is a possibility of Federal-State injunctions.

And this Court

has looked with a lack of encouragement to teat activity,

And

w® have had alternatives and occasionally have gone before the
Federal court to seek injunctive relief.
But on this question, on th© question of State power
to control on-reservation, \m have come up through direct
appeals —
QUESTION?

At what point in tee litigation did you

first assert sovereign immunity as a defense?
MR. RODGERS?

Sovereign immunity, your Honor, has

been asserted in this litigation ever since the case began.
It was rejected in Puyallup I on th© premise that wa were
dealing with an action against individuals off reservation.
That premise is now dissipated.

It has been urged throughout

here and was decided against us on the merits by the Washington
State Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

That court thought it was doing no more

than obeying the order on remand of this Court in Puyallup XI.
MR. RODGERS;
^

QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor.

So instead of their wid® precedent that

«. Ar-

You indicated that affirmance h©r© might mean, really this is
just limi-feed to the Washington Supreme Court£s carrying out
what this Court told it to do on remand of this particular and
praeis® casa, isn't it?
MR. RODGERS;

But to do that, your Honor, as the

concurring opinion below indicates, you have to read Puyallup 31
as contradicting 150 years of Indian law.
QUESTION;
MR. RODGERS

¥®S,
%

In conclusion,
QUESTION;

And w® believe that you cannot do that.
let me ■—

Mi. Rodgers, let me ask you on® more

question.
I take it if you are right in this sovereign
immunity should have been recognised far earlier than now
that both of our decisions in Puyallup 1 and Puyallup £1 are

71
wiped out because if the Supremo Court of Washington had no
jurisdiction, we surely had no jurisdiction.
MR. RODGERS:

No, your Honor, because those casas,

based upon the premises established — and indeed they wares
facts — and those cases were off-reservation casas involving
individual Indians —
QUESTION:

The same case as this case.

It's the

same litigation.
QUESTION:

Where do the facts turn?

MR. RODGERS:

But the reservation now exists, and

the orders that initially ran against individuals now run
against the tribe.

The tribal council, the tribal governing

body, its legislative body, has been ordered to enact closures,
to enforces closures.

The case has been transformed from an

off-reservation individual case into
against the tribe itself.

an on-reservation suit

And I would submit in conclusion

■that the history of this litigation has been determined by on®
overriding factor, and that is restrict the Indian fishery.
We hava had in this case argued at various times that
the tribe is defunct, that the treaty is a worthless scrap of
<

paper, that the reservation doesn't exist, but that if it does,
there is power to control as if it did not.
We urge the Court; to go further and to dismiss on
the ground w@ fear that the slightest ambiguity in its disposition
will result in additional litigation.

72
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:11 p.m., the arguments in th©
above-entitled matter were concluded.]
