MORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. PHELAN, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE
MR. PIIELAN:
the

APPELLEES

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

Court:
This is voting case.

It pertains to the right of

the voter to cast his ballot and have it counted.
Now, let me say — first of all make it clear that
the plaintiff-appellee in this case is a citizen and voter
who case a vote in favor of the Niagara Charter who brings
this action on behalf of all voters similarly

situated.

In addition to Mr. Shedd, the citizen and voter,

31

we have joined the community organisation which played a
leadership role in bringing about this charter.

But our

primary reliance so far as standing is concerned is upon Mr.
Shedd's status as a citizen and voter.
Let me, first of all, refer to the theory of the
palintiff~appellee's action.

Number one, in 1963 the State

of New York, in order to grant substantially incx'eased local
power to it s principal unit of local government, the county,
passed a constitutional amendment in which it extended this
grant of power.
IN so doing, the State of\New York provided that there
7 A"

v.

should be a voting process that should take place in connection
with that grant of power, and provided that in the geographic
unit involved, the county, the principal unit of local
government, having general governmental powers, that there
vrauld be this voting process.
There is in this case the elements

of the plaintiff- •

appellee's cause of action is that no citizen of the general
unit of local government is burdened or benefitted, that there
is nc citizen, no group of citizens, who are primarily
interested as compared to any other group of ctiizens.
Once the State of New York did that, once the sovereign
State of New York did that, and granted that voting process,
we respectfully submit that of course, under all the cases in
this Court, it became bound to applaud and comport with the

32
rights of the voters as provided by this Court .
Now, what the State of New York did in such
instance, however, it divided the voters of the county
into —
QUESTION:

Don't get too far away from the micro­

phone, or you may be not on the record,
NR, PHELAN:

I'm sorry.

It divided the voters of the county into two
separate units consisting of the voters of the cities, to be
counted as one unit, and the voters of the town in the area
of the — West of the county in question.
So that — what our cause of action is, in so doing
what the

State of New York did was that it created two

separate voting units,that it, number one, those voting
units were based upon a geographical basis, based upon the
place of residence of the persons, of the voters involved;
number two, they were voting units of unequal population; in
the case of the county of Niagra, the cities involved -- and
this is the only — the unique case in the State of New York
the cities had a majority.

There are 147,000 residents

in

cities, and some 80,000 in the area outside the cities and
in the rest of the county.
QUESTION:
MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

How many cities are there in the county?
There are three, Hr. Justice Stewart.
And how many towns?

33

MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION;

Thera are U.
And then villages are in tox<ms?

MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Toms are what we call.otherwise

townships t is that it?
MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And there are one or more villages in

each town, I suppose --MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:
MR. PHELAN:

That’s correct.
— some of the towns.
Right.

The basic unit of local

government in New York State, and the oldest unit of local
government in New York State*, is the county.

did, it gridded its counties.

A hundred

And what New York

It provided, I think, it’s

160 square rods, as I recall, and there are so many counties
now.
What happened is, over the former government that
existed prior to this constitutional amendment in 1963 was
that the counties were governed by committees, that the
numbers of the -— in each town, had a supervisor, and the
supervisor of those towns served on the board of supervisors.

35

MR- PHELAN:

Well, first of all, if the — you would

not then have a self-contained geographic unit, if the state
did that.
Now, first of all, let me address myself to the
annexation question.

So far as annexation is concerned, the

State of New York provides that the territory to be annexed
shall be treated as a single geographic unit, and have the
right, in a single unit vote, to vote whether or riot it
wishes to annexed.
So far as the merger of two cities, certainly.
In the — so long as •— for example, taka the Hunter against
Pittsburgh case.

What occurred there was the state legislature

decided to permit the City of Pittsburgh to merge with the
City of Alleghany.

The City of Alleghany complained.

was far more developed.

It

It had far more asset properties.

And they took that case to this Court, and this court said
that they had no complaint, and that the states are sovereign
as far as this is concerned.

Unless — unless:

I think that's

even in the Hunter case —■ Unless they intrude upon or impair
the fundamental rights of citizens.
Now, in the Hunter case, the Court found that this
was solely a debt question, a financial question, so there was
no such intrusion.
QUESTION:

Well, they talked about, in terms of

arranging the structure of a political subdivision.

36
MR. PHELAN: There is no question, fir. Justice
Rehnquist, that tha states are sovereign to manage and arrange
their political subdivisions as they please.

There is great

flexibility, so long as they do not intrude upon the funda­
mental constitutional rights of tha citizens.
And once the State — as I understand the law of
this Court ™ once a state decides to create a voting process,
for example, then they must do it in a way that complies with
the fundamental constitutional rights of a citizen.

And once

a geographic unit is established, and a voting process is
provided, once the state feels it's so important to provide
a voting process, then they must do it in a

way which does

not violate the right of each citizen to have his vote counted
equally.
QUESTION:

#655

Well, let's see — I doubt — this is

rather like the — this procedure is not unlike the
procedure in Hill and Stone.
MR. PHELAN: I believe it is, that’s right.
QUESTION:

Pretty ranch the same thing?

mr. phelan: That's right.
QUESTION:

Then does this case come down to whether

the state has established a compelling state interest, as Hill
and Stone said it must, to justify that

procedure?

MR. PHELAN: The state made no -- it does, in ray
judgement.

37

QUESTION:

Is that what the case comes down to?

MR. PHELAN: That's what the case comes down to, in
my judgement.
And the state made no effort to establish that it
had a compelling state interest here.

It formed, as I see

the division here, the creation of identifiable groups within
the county, based upon place of residence.

Mr. Fuzak now

complains in this Court that the state might have done that.
The

fact is, in the District Court., the state

defended onthe ground of sovereignty, on the ground of form
and structure.

Mr. Fuzak has been in here as an intervenor

appellant for almost two years now, and I see no fact — as
a matter of fact, I suggest Mr. Justice Brennan, that it's
inevitable that if the State attempts to; demonstrate any facts
whereby town citizens, town residents, are different kinds of
citizens that city residents, they inevitably fall—
QUESTION:

Well, are there town' interests, special

town interests that might be affected by -— say in the way of
transfer of powers to the county government if the county
government
MR. PHELAN: There are not, Mr. Justice Brennan.
Both charters expressly provide that there shall be no transfer
of function, that the towns shall continue to have the same
function, the same powers, the same responsibilities as it
previously had.

38
QUESTION:

Well, it was suggested yesterday, for

example, that the new county government might be able to
usurp the law enforcement function by setting up its own
county police force and that sort of thing»
MR. PHELAN': The -- it might»
there is no transfer of function here.

The fact is, that
Of course, the purpose

of this amendment was that there should be —• what we had
was government by 54 man committees in urbanized counties,
in effect.

Or in this case, 25-man committees.
QUESTION:

Sorry, Mr.

Phelan, what are the three

cities?
MR. PIIELAN:

The three cities are the city of

Niagra Falls, the city of Lockport which is contained within
the town of Lockport who's the intervenor, and the city of
North Tonawanda.
But what — Mr. Fuzak was really saying was that
if we modernize county government, which the state wanted to
do, and saw the necessity for.

We’re dealing with urbanized

counties of a million, million and a half people, which is
archaic, obsolete, what our papers call a oxcart government.
And the whole purpose of this was to modernize it.
The reason that these —
QUESTION: Can every county in New York State go
adopt this?
MR. PHELAN:

Outside the City of New York, Mr.

39

Justice Brennan-

The 57 counties of ’Tew York State, each

one can do thisWhat

happened was, and I think it’s fair to say, it

was a new way of political decision.

people that are affected by this constitutional amendment,

half million town residents.
1963.

The amendment was adopted in

As soon as the line of

cases started in this Court

with Baker against Carr, it should have been repealed.
In 1967 we had a constitutional convention? the
most prominent men in the State of New York.

This was

repealed unanimously, the proposition was passed unanimously
on the floor of the convention.

I think in six months it

was the only proposition passed unanimously to comport
with just v?hat we're talking here, to comnly with the one
man, one vote doctrine.
That constitution was not adopted because it was
all submitted as one oackage.
which I refer to in my

But the vote on this proposition,

brief, was unanimous.

And this is not rooted in the law of the State of
Mew York.

It was done pragmatically? I think it's fair to

say, in order to have the amendment adopted.

The fact is

that it violates the principles that this Court has enunciated,
over the past ten or twelve years.
QUESTION:

It creates —

Mr. Phelan, your opposition relies on

40
Gordon against Lance „
by that case,

.And I'll confess I'm somewhat bothered

Somewhere, will you comment on that before

your time is up.
QUESTIOH:

Yes, right now, Mr. Justice Rlackmun.

Gordon against Lance recoani^ed -- and I concede
that in a proper case a state could conceivably, based upon
fact,

could find that because of the nature of the function

being involved that there

had to be a super majority as its

called in Gordon against Lance.
But at the same time Gordon against Lance specifically
referred to the fact that there was in that case no classi­
fication of voters based upon 'where they lived; there was no
discreet insular minority who were going to be affected;
that there were no violations -- the principles of Gray
against Sanders — and in my judgement, Gray against Sanders
which applied statewide virtually applied county-wide here.
And if you didn't have —
QUESTION: Where's the discreet, insular minority
in this case as you see it?
MR. PIIELAN}

In this case, the case now before this

Court, it's the residents and voters of the town.
be either one.

It could

The fact is that this provision separating

voters based upon the place of residence in this case

per­

mitted some 18% of the voters to —
QUESTION:

Well, we used the term discreet, insular

41
minority in our opinions, that is suggesting people in need
of special protection.

You're suggesting the very opposite,

aren't you?
MR. PHELAN:

What the appellant suggests is that

the voters of the towns are in need of special protection,
despite the fact that they're a majority.

The point I make

is that what happens here is that the vote of one or the
other units cancels out the vote of the unit which wishes to
pass the charter.

If there's a majority, as occurred here,

a countywide, a majority in the cities, those votes aren't
even counted because the minority in the towns voted against
the —
QUESTION:

Wasn’t this true as a matter of principle

in Gordon against Lance where 40% controlled GO.
MR. PHELAN:

That's correct in Gordon against Lance„

The only question there was whether or not, in a particular
instance based upon a compelling state interest, that a —
other than a substantial or equal account might be permitted.
In this case, I really think that the question of
population in this case is secondary,

’’’he primary thing that

was done here is that the voters of the counties of New York
were separated into town voters, that they were divided
based upon where they lived.
733

And it's inevitable when

that's done that you divide them based upon the —
In other words, the point is, there's no difference

42
between city and town voters.
QUESTION;

Are you saying that really Lance is

not applicable here?

Because that dealt with whether the

Court in that circumstance be a requirement of more than a
simple majority, a 60% majority?
HR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right, Mr. Justice.
You say that can’t be — this is more

like the dual box situation that we had in Hill and. Stone.
MS. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Because it’s not a simple

majority here.

The smallest of minorities, I gather, can have a veto.
MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Over the majority vote of the cities.

MR. PHELAN:

As little as 2% in Nassau County.

And more — I think in that regard, there was no
effort here — first of all there was no effort here by the
State to justify why in changing the form and structure of
its most basic form of local government, that there even
744

should be a —
QUESTION:

What is the minority, the city or the

town?
MR. PHELAN:
towns, Mr. Justice

The minority in this case is in the

Marshall.

QUESTION:
MR. PHELAN:

I mean in the statute?
No, the statute requires that there be

43

dual majority.

And it’s not aimed at any particular

group?

No, it's not.

It’s not —

It's not aimed at any oarticular group?
Yes, it is aimed at a particular group.
What particular group?
It’s aimed at the group that is opposing

It’s aimed at the governments — it permits — it

The fact is that in this —

But there is no — this wasn't targetted

on any group?
MR. PHELAN:

I think that’s fair to say, that it’s

complementary —
QUESTION:

Well, where do you get under Reynolds

and Sims and all the other cases?
MR. PHELAN;

You get on it because it’s a division

of voters based on where they live.

It’s one of the suspect

categories of race, sex, v/ealth, occupation or place of
residence.

44
QUESTION:

Don’t people live — what constitutional

provision are we talking about, where people live?
NR. PHELAN:

I'm talking about a division of voters

of giving them a right to cancel out the vote of the
entire geographic

unit based upon where they live.

QUESTION:
MR. PHELAN:

What case makes that a suspect category?
The -- first of all, I think the Gray

against Sanders case applies, because as Judge Timber said,
this is in accordance with Gray, Reynolds and Avery line of
cases, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Very clearly the fact, and undoubtedly

the purpose of this legislation, was to allow a minority
who were opposed to change to block a change favored by the
majority.

That was its purpose, and that's its effect.
MR. PHELAN:

That’s exactly right.

I think that's true.

That's right.

I don't think it's any different

than the Carrington case —
QUESTION:

And in that respect, it's precisely the

same as the super-majority requirement, isn't it?
MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

No, it's not.
Well, that's exactly —- it permits a

minority to block a change, and specifically for that purpose,
doesn't, it?
MR. PHELAN:

In the Gordon against Lance case, you

found that because of the long term effect of the incurring

45
of debt because the State of West Virginia had justified the
situation, it had come in with evidence of the necessity for
it, you said, in that case, yes, there may be a super majority.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn’t the answer.

The

treated alike.

But not here.

MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:
MR. PHELAN:

Everybody’s

No, that’s right.
Well, isn't that the difference?
The difference here is that people are

differently based upon where they live.
QUESTION:

Whether they live in towns or live in

cities.
MR. PHELAN:

Whether they live in towns or whether

they live in cities.
QUESTION:

All of them living within the political

subdivision which
MR. PHELAN:

Which

exercises general government —

QUESTION: — exercises the electoral franchise.
MR. PIIELAN:

Right.

Right.

May I pass what I consider to be the major contention
of the opponent —of the opponent here, and that is the
question of form or structure, and whether, or not you've
reached form or structure so far as the application of one
man, one vote.

And I suggest to you that the line ■— first of

all, going right back to Reynolds against Sims, it's the

46
voting process — the majority said it*s the voting process
that’s in question.
I think a good focus on the question so far as the
application to this case is the language of Justice Black in
the Hadley case, when he tried to analyze this whole question
of local governments creating a voting process, in which he
said that whether or not — which is most important, to vote
for a sheriff, to vote for a United States Senator ?

And

that once a local government decides that the matter is so
important that there shall be a vote, as the State of New
York decided here, then the vote shall be in accordance with —
and comply with the constitutional rights„

But once the State

what's happened here is the State has said that this should
be government by the people.

And what we’re saying here is

that therefore it shall be government in accordance with the
equal protection.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phelan, has there been any further

effort to repeal this provision since the defeat of the
792

Nebraska constitution?
MR. PHELAN:
Brennan.

There has been no effort, Mr. Justice

No, only in the constitutional convention.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phelan, is your argument equally

applicable as a ground for holding a bicameral legislature
unconstitutional?
MR. PHELAN:

No, I think you — and as you said

47
at times here? there are special — I don’t think so.

You've

got special provisions relating —■ you've got history re­
lating to bicameral legislature which, I guess, in Gray
against Sanders, where the State of Georgia tries to take
advantage of it.
And i think the — in this case it’s no — it's
simply the division based upon where people live.

Let me —

if I may, because of my time limitation, move on very
quickly,

My opponent refers to the res

judicata issue

here, and I'd like to point out that what occurred here is
after the defeat of the 1972 referendum, the county of Niagra
in main brought this action.
#798

the aggrieved class of voters.

They had no right to represent
There was no privity.

And more importantly, I think, the question — as
Judge Tirrbers focussed on in his opinion — whether or not
there could ever be adequate representation.
I think the clearest way to say it is the fact that
Mr. Fuzak and I are on opposite sides of the issue, that
the county — there were two classes of voters here.
is a class of voters here that

There

favored change and asked for

their constitutional rights as a majority, and there’s a class
that opposed it.

And we're both here.

And it’s impossible

for the county to represent the two.
Secondly — secondly — if you will look at the
original action

I think that it’s fair to say that the

question of adequate representation was very much involved
so far as whether or not the constitutional issues were
presented to that district court in the first place.

The

district court in that case, a good district judge who is
now deceased, was called upon to do his only search on this
entire subject,

riot

one of these cases, including Baker

against Carr, was presented to him.
of research.

Tie did a certain amount

Unfortunately, his research did not take him

to the Avery case.
QUESTION:

Is that kind of an insuperable task ,

if you ask a district judge to do his own research?
MR. PHELAN:

Well, this is a very difficult —

this is a tough question.
No, it’s not insuperable.

My point is — no, my

point is —
QUESTION: Mr. Phelan, sometimes we have to weed it cut.
MR. PHELAN:

I know that, Mr. Justice Brennan.

No, my point is, Mr. Justice Rshnquist, as Judge
Timbers pointed out, on the question of whether or not
there’s been adequate representation, one of the elements is
whether or not the constituional issues were so framed that
they can be focussed on by the court.
And in addition to that, throughout this case, in
the district court the county has been our adversary.

And

including the point in time when, after they lost the case

49

but it hadn't been appeal, Mr. Shedd going before the
county legislature and asking them, please just file a notice
of appeal so we could protect the situation.
Secondly, on the question of the 1974 trial, I'd
like to make this point, that what occurred here — with an
unusual situation --- that after the State of Hew York decided
not to appeal —
QUESTION:

Counsel, I've just been informed that

the length system seems to be malfunctioning today, and you're
cutting into your colleagues5 time.

We'll take some

responsibility for that, but not all.
MR. PIIELAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may I just say in

closing, one conceptual point.

Yesterday, in preparing for

this argument, I happened to run across Mr. Justice — Mr.
Rogers' comment here about the importance of the whole line
of Baker against Carr, and his reference to Mr. Chief Justice
Warren's comment after he retired.

And what's occurred here

in the State of New York is that this pro/ision has frozen
our system the flexibility" which should be permitted has
not been.

And as a result, the democracy is not breathing,

that the political system h.as .not kept pace with the social
and economic changes throughout in our metropolitern area in
the State of New York.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phelan, could I just suggest, though,

that in the towns where the vote only lost by some 200 votes,

50

you only got about 20% of the vote out, or 25%.

Maybe the

freezing isn’t the provision, but just not adequate campaigning
in this particular issue.
MR. PHELAN:
QUESTION:

MR. PHELAN:

I think that's right.

I respectfully submit that the judgement of the District
Court should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

all of that against you, because it’s our system that's

So you have 8 minutes left.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LANCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I appreciate your consideration in this matter.
The main reason I want to speak to this Court is
to bring certain matters to the Court's attention.

IN the

stemming from the lower court's judgement until this -— up

that this matter is still in litigation.
HR. LANCE:

Yes, this matter is still in litigation,

and I'm asking — I'm addressing this to the sound discretion
of this Court, regardless of how the constitutional issue is
decided, that in view of the fact the State of New York
voluntarily filed the 1974 charter, which I would take as
acquiescence in the decision of the lower court, that the
1974 charter of the county be allowed to remain in the full
force and effect, regardless of any decision this Court makes
regarding the constitutional issue which has been placed
before it.

That would be the first point I'd want to make

to this Court.

knew about New York law — allowed the town to intervene,
didn’t they?
MR. LANCE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And apparently conceded them as a party,

treated’ the town as a party?
HR. LANCE:

The county was treated as a party in

that .—
QUESTION:
.HR. LANCE:

I mean the town.
The town was, yes, sir.

But as far as the result of this Court deciding
against Hr. Phelan's position would be concerned, I think
we have a germane and direct interest in what would occur
then.

If the decision of this Court, and its direction to

the District Court would be, that the county of Niagra must
dissolve the charter form of government it now had, I envision
a result where the District Court would end Tin making admini­
strative decisions as to hot/ to do these things, and I think
create great chaos in county government.
QUESTION:

Whose responsibility is that, do you

suggest?
HR. LANCE:

I would suggest no one bears direct

responsibility, Hr. Chief Justice.

I think it was one of

those things that was bound to happen, the way the lawsuit

54
was brought, and the way it was handled throughout by the
litigating pai'ties.

X don't think anybody

could have avoided

that result, really»
There has been some notion, if I might say, there
has been some notion in the past that the county of Niagra
and state officials disregarded the District Court's order
regarding — or judgement regarding the '72 charter, and that
simply is not true.

Those bodies went ahead and did what they

were allowed to do under state and muricipal law in the State
t

of New York»

There was no necessary'— there was no application

necessary to the court, nor was there any violation of any
court order.

You said there had been no stays entered.

sought?

HR. LANCE:

They were sought.

They were sought from

the District Court and I believe one was sought —
QUESTION:
HR. LANCE:

By whom?
I think it was sought by Hr. Fusak, if

I'm not mistaken about that.

And I know there was, one sought

from Mr. Justice Marshall by

Mr. Fuzak.

And I would like to —• if I might go on with one
further point here.

I suppose that the county as a litigant

here, or at least through its officers, is responsible
for this direction on remand that has caused some difficulty
to some of the other parties, at least, they briefed it this

55
way.
I want to point out one thing to the Court:

that

when we were called down to District Court, and this Court!s
direction on remand was said, Judge Curtin said to all the
attorneys who

were there present, we have a procedural

problem here, and unless I get a stipulation from all counsel
that I can look at the 1974 counsel, and unless I can make
the state pourt proceedings part of the record.
Now, there was some discussion on that, but I
recall, and the Judge's decision recites, and the judgement
recites, that that stipulation was had.
That being the case, and there being no issue of
fact before the court,

I believe that the court had jurisdiction

to enter the judgement it did in regard to the 1974 judgement.
Incidentally, when that happened, the county of Niagra was
then satisfied that there was no issue of mootness before
the court, because the issue involved before this court now
involved a charter which we're operating under.
I believe that, therefore -- and I agree whole­
heartedly as I said before with Mr. Phelan —• that there is a
violation of due process of laws requirement of the United
States constitution.

Under the article of the state

constitution which is being attacked, and under municipal
home rule law, Section 33, subdivision 7.
There was one other point which IEd like to mention

56

to the Court, and it’s this, if X may:

and it’s this

question of Huffman versus Pursue, and the- injunction entered
against the state court proceeding.

X. think a reading of that

case in our situation v/ill clearly, differentiate the two
cases.
In our particular case, a federal court action had
been pending some time
instituted.

before the state court action was

In the Huffman case, it was just the reverse,

as I recall it.
I have no more comment to make in regard to the
constitutional issues -—
QUESTION:

Mr. Lance, could I then ask you just

an informational question?
MR. LANCE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
What kind of vote does it take to amend

the New York constitution?
MR. LANCE:

The New York State constitution?

believe it has to pass the legislature twice and be

by a majority of all the voters in the state.

QUESTION:

But it’s a majority, not a super-majority?

MR. LANCE:

That's my understanding, your hon6r.

QUESTION:

A majority of all the voters, not just

of those voting?
MR. LANCE:

QUESTION:

That’s much differant from all the —

I guess, depending on the term, voters.
MR. LANCE:

Then — maybe I misunderstood the

question.
QUESTION:
MR. LANCE:

A majority of those actually voting?
Yes.

When the resolution is put on the

ballot boxes in the state of New York, it’s a majority of
those voting.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:36 o’clock, a.m., on December
1976, the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
