ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from the United States
District Court of the Eastern District of New York.
The issue concerns the imposition of a support test
on widowers but not widows as a condition on eligibility for
Social Security survivors benefits.
The appellee is a retired Federal employee and a
widower.

Following the death of his wife, he applied for

Social Security widower's benefits under his deceased wife's
earning account, that is, he sought to tack Social Security
retirement benefits,. Social Security survivor's benefits, onto
his existing Civil Service pension.
If appellee had been a private employee, rather than
a civil servant, he would not have been able to tack benefits
in this way even without regard to the support test he challenges
here.
The reason for this is that both widows and widowers,
to be eligible for survivor's benefits, must pass what may

4
for convenience be called the PIA test*

PXA refers to the

primary Insurance amount* which is the maximum monthly old-age
benefit to which a wage earner is entitled under his or her own
earnings account*
Only a survivor whose PIA is less than that of the
deceased spouse is entitled to survivors benefits*

And it is'

undisputed that if appellee's lifetime had been covered by
Social Security he could not have passed this test.
The PIA test bars a widower from tacking a smaller
survivor's benefit onto an existing Social Security old-age
benefit.

The theory behind this rule is that Social Security

benefits are not vested rights but are payable on the basis of
probable need.
If a widower is already receiving old-age benefits
in excess of the survivor's benefits to which he would other­
wise be entitled* he probably is not needy.

But the PIA test*

standing alone* is insufficient* inadequate* to weed out nonneedy Federal pensioners such as appellee.

It is Inadequate to

weed out this category of non-needy widowers.
To achieve this end of weed ing out such widowers,
Congress has imposed a second test* the support test that is
at issue in this case,

Under this test* a widower must prove

that he was receiving more than one-half his support from his
wife at the time of her death* disability or retirement.
The practical effect of the support test is suggested in

5
Appendix to our brief»

In short* if the support test were

eliminated, approximately $447 million annually would be
required to be distributed to non-needy widowers.

And of this,

from $35^> million would be required to be distributed to nonneedy pensioners such as appellee,
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, it has been a while since I

read these briefs in this case.

Am I right in understanding

that the basic PIA test is applicable alike to males and
females?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And it is only this additional test that

differentiates between men and women.
MR. JONES:

That's correct,

The problem in this case is that the support test
does not apply to women,

A widow, age 60 or older, who

passes the PIA test is entitled to survivor's benefits without
regard to support.

Thus, a woman similarly situated to

appellee, that is, a retired female civil servant whose
husband's lifetime employment had been covered by Social
Security would be entitled to survivor's benefits.
This loophole in the Social Security law does not
appear ever to have received explicit Congressional attention.
And it is upon the existence of this loophole that creates
different treatment for this small, narrow class of men and
women upon which appellee's case largely depends.

6
QUESTION;
the case.

Mr. Jones, I am also a little rusty in

This $440 million figure which applies to this

small, narrow class, is that based on anything in the record or
is that something you developed subsequently and just in the
briefs here?
MR. JONES:
Stevens.

It is not in the record, Mr. Justice

The methodology underlying the estimate is spelled

out in the Appendix to our brief on the merits.

The amount

involved was not put in issue in the District Court, as far as
I understand it.
The appellee could not pass the support test.

He

had not, in fact, been dependent upon his wife, and for that
reason he was denied widower's benefits.

He then brought

this suit in District Court and the District Court declared
the support test as to widowers unconstitutional, relying in
large part upon this Court's opinions in Weinberger v.
Wlesenfeld and Prontiero v. Richardson,
Before turning to a discussion of those two cases
which underpin the appellee's arguments here, I would like to
make some general observations about the appellee's arguments
on the merits.
Although appellee is a man and it Is the denial of
benefits to himself he complains of, he has sought to portray
this statutory classification as discriminating principally
against women.

He contends that the real discrimination here

7
is against the deceased working wives whose widowers must now
prove support, that is, largely against the deceased working
wives of civil servants.
Of course, as an analytical matter, the discrimination,
if any,, bears equally upon these widowers and their deceased
working wives.

These two categories, one male and one female,

necessarily are present here on a one to one ratio.
That suggests that this case does not involve sex
discrimination at all but rather discrimination, if any, against
certain kinds of families, that is, appellee's kind of family.
But putting that aside, at a minimum, all other
things being equal, the choice of which sex to characterize
as the disadvantaged class here would appear to be a matter
of purely rhetorical significance.

Yet all other things are

not equal.
There is not a legislative motive here to dis­
criminate against women.

Congress plainly designed the

support test simply to deny benefits to non-needy widowers, such
as appellee.

The difference in treatment Is aimed at men not

at viomen.
Since this is so, it may seem all the more puzzling
why the appellee has worked so hard to characterize the support
test as discriminating principally against women.

But there

are, 1 suspect, three good reasons for this approach.
First, appellee is attempting to obscure the fact

8
that what he seeks here is a double benefit, that is, it is
a windfall in the nature of Social Security survivors benefits
on top of the Civil Service pension»
QUESTION:

If the genders were reversed, he would

— she would get this windfall, wouldn't she?
MR* JONES:

That is correct, Mr* Justice Stewart,

that is the loophole*
QUESTION:

Well, any time somebody doesn't like a

provision of the law he calls it a loophole*

This is a

provision of the law*
MR* JONES:

Sometimes they call it unconstitutional*

(laughter)
MR* JONES:

But it does seem to me that the

appellee understandably

seeks to divert the court's attention

away from the obvious rationality of Congress' decision to
deny him this double benefit*

And that purpose I would like

to frustrate*
It is plain here that vhafc he seeks is a windfall*
It is true it is a windfall that's available to women of a
special, narrow class, but that does not mean it is a
constitutional matter,

it should also be made available to

him*
QUESTION:

Well, that's the question in this case,

isn * t it ?
MR. JONES:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

9
I think the second reason that the appellee seeks
to characterize this as a women's rights case is that the
cause of women's rights is now a fashionable one and the
appellee seeks to ride on its skirt-tails.

But it is the

responsibility of this Court to act on the basis of what
reflects a proper accommodation of the respective roles of
Congress and the courts, and not to act on the basis of i^hat
may be favored by the shifting tides of extra-judicial legal
fashion*
But the third reason why appellee may be characteriz­
ing this as a women's rights case is the one that disturbs me
the most«

Appellee may be implicitly suggesting that the

rights of women are constitutionally entitled to higher
protection than the rights of men.
As a lawyer and as a member of the class that would
thereby be disadvantaged, I would urge this Court to reject
any such subtle suggestion»

Women constitute a majority of

the voting age population in this country.

Unlike racial

minorities, for example, women have the political power, if
they choose to use it, to remedy any statutory inequality of
which they perceive themselves to be the victims.

In short,

women are not a discreet, insular minority that requires
special judicial protection against an indifferent or a hostile
legislature.
This is not to say that women have not been subject

10
to legal and social discrimination in the past*

That history

of discrimination justifies remedial legislation that extends
to women certain benefits or opportunities that may not be
made available on the same basis to men*
in Kahn, v * S hey in.
go*

This Court so held

But further than that, the courts may not

Men and women are entitled to the same statute under the

Constitution,

The same constitutional analysis must apply

whether the discrimination of which appellee complains is
directed against men or against women,
With these preiminary thoughts in mind, I would now
turn to discussion of this Court's opinions in Frontlero and
Wjesenf eld =,
The statutory classification at issue in Frontlero
was concededly superficially quite similar to the one involved
here.

But superficial similarities of that kind are largely

irrelevant to equal protection analysis»
At the heart of any equal protection inquiry, is
whether the challenge classification is rationally related to
a permissible and a substantial legislative objective*
In Frontlero the differential treatment accorded
men and women furthered no objective other than mere
administrative convenience.

The Government so conceded and

this Court so held.
And that objective, the Court held, was insufficiently
substantial to justify the difference in treatment.

That

11
rationale is not applicable here.

The statutory classification

challenged here is not rooted in mere administrative convenience.
Instead* as I will show momentarily, the classification reflects
Congress 1 legitimate efforts rationally to allocate so scarce
Social Security's monies on the basis of the probable needs of
competing classes of potential beneficiaries.
Yes, Mr* Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Would it not be correct that the decision

not to require a support test in the converse situation is
justified by administrative convenience?
MR* JONES:

It is justified by several factors and

administrative convenience is one of them.
QUESTION:
MR* JONES;

What are the others? —
But it is not rooted in administrative

convenience*
The rational basis, or the social welfare considera­
tions on which the Government relies here, are spelled out at
length at pages 15 to 36 of our main brief.

But I can summar­

ise them here*
The Social Security provisions for widows and widowers
have separate and different histories.

Hi 1939, Congress

determined to pay monthly benefits to those groups of survivors
whose probable need was the greatest*

And it identified those

groups as elderly widows, dependent children and aged dependent
parents *

12

And, although a major purpose of this support test
~~ excuse me — of the survivors 1 benefits was to replace the
support lost by a dependent upon the death of the wage earner.
Congress did not restrict widows' benefits to those
women who were;, in fact, dependent upon their husbands.

And

the reasons for this* Mr, Justice Stevens, were two-fold.
First, in 3.939, and for many years thereafter, very
few aged women were, in fact, not economically dependent upon
their husbands.

And to have imposed the support test would

have placed a substantial burden upon all of those widows and
upon the administrative agency as well.

And that burden would

have been incurred to weed out a very small percentage of non­
dependent women.
Indeed, the appellee here concedes that the imposition
of the support test upon widows would entail —» and I quote
from pages 65 and 68 of his brief -- nan exhorbifcant administra­
tive burden of potentially monstrous proportion,1' That's the
appellee's language, that's not our language.
So that, to some extent, Mr» Justice Stevens, you
are correct that the extension of benefits to women does have
some basis in administrative convenience.

But, at the same

time, the non-dependent women who would have been weeded out
by a support test are very likely to have been needy
in any event.
The women who would pass the support test, that is,

the women who receive less than half their support from their
husbands# were very likely to have been either deserted or to
have been living In other circumstances of substantial need.
Very few aged

widows were truly self-sufficient *

And it was

both reasonable and humane for Congress to extend widows
benefits to these women without regard to dependency*
QUESTION:

Doesn*t your argument suggest that there

is not necessarily a correlation between the ability to pass
the support test and probable need at the time that the
applicant applies for benefit?

MR* JONES:

Thatls certainly true as to widows and

it was fcruer3 perhaps., in 1939 than it is today.

At that time

— and I must confess that the statistics are very rough —but at that time, it is a fair inference that considerably
fewer than 10$ of all women would have passed the support
test at any given point in time —
QUESTION:

MR* JONES:

Would have fought the support test*
Would have fought the support test*

thatfs correct, would have been non-dependent,

That's correct*

— at any given point in time* at any point in their
employment history*

And* as to women age 55 and older# there

was a decrease in their participation in the job market*

So

that# it would be considerably less than 10$ for these aged
women*

But not only that# these are women who probably did

not work over the full course of their working lives# who may

have worked sporadically, but who probably did not build up
substantial Social earnings, entitlements or other retirement
benefits *
So, as to this class of working women, It is a fair
assumption, I think, that even those women who were nondependent at the critical point, still existed in circumstances
of need*
Now, the same is not true, 1 submit, generally, as
to widowers*

The program of widowers' benefits was established

later, in 1950»

At that time, Congress reasonably identified

as presumptively needy only those widowers who had been depen­
dent on their wives for support,

With few exceptions, non-

dependent men either had substantial Social Security entitle­
ments or they had been gainfully employed in positions outside
the Social Security systems, like the appellee, and they,
therefore, fell outside the category of probable need.
And the support test served to weed out approximately
97$ of all widowers, whereas, it would have only weeded out
/

less than 10$ of widows,

And if the support test had not been

imposed, from 75$ to 90$ of the additional monies that would
have been required to be paid out would have been paid to nonneedy pensioners such as the appellee,
Congress rationally chose not to spend its scarce
Social Security monies in that manner*
QUESTION:

But I suppose there are seme widowers who

15
are needy but who can’t pass the support test.
MR» JONES:

It depends upon what you mean by needy,

Mr,, Justice White.
QUESTION:

Well, what's the purpose of the support

test in the first place?
MR, JONES'

To weed out the non~needy, basically.

QUESTION;

To weed out the non-needy, which implies

there are some that are not needy, or you wouldn't have to weed
anybody out,
MR* JONES;

Well, I think, as a practical matter,

excuse me, I may have misunderstood you — it implies that
some widowers are non-needy?
QUESTION;

My initial question was; aren't there some

widowers who are needy even though they cannot pass the support
test?
• MR* JONES;

Again, Mr, Justice White, I say that may

well depend on the standard of neediness that you use in a
welfare system.

It is certainly hypothetically possible that

there are some men who were self-supporting who, nevertheless,
were needy.
Now, there are, of course, supplementary programs
which are designed to alleviate the need of those people whose
need lias not been entirely met by the Social Security,
QUESTION:

Has the man involved in this case ever

indicated he was needy?

16
MR, JONES:
QUESTION;

He has not.
Would this case here be any different if

he had?
MR, JONES:

Well, it would certainly be more

attractive on the facts for the other side,
As a statistical matter, Mr. Justice White, 85$,
roughly, of the benefits we are talking about go to Civil
Service pensioners.

They are plainly not needy.

And of the

other percentages, we cannot say with certainty that no needy
person would thereby be given benefits, but,as a practical
matter, it is a rare member of the so-called disadvantaged
class here who, In fact, is needy.
QUESTION;

Maybe I misunderstood, but, as I understood

my brother White's question it was directed — or at least, my
question is directed to this proposition;

Why is the fact that

a widow or widower may have received more than one-half of his
support during the lifetime of his spouse from his spouse
relevant to his present neediness?
MR, JONES:

Well, the time in which it is measured

is not during the lifetime, but at the time of the death,
retirement or disability5 of the spouse.
QUESTION:
death.

All right, at the time of the spouse's

Why is that fact relevant to his present state of need?

MR. JONES:

Well, if he was dependent upon his wife

at that point and if he is a retired widower, then it is

17
unlikely that he has extrinsic sources of support and the
survivor‘s benefit serves to replace the support he has, in
fact, lost*

We may say that he is presumed needy by virtue

of that.
QUESTION:
isn’t it?

It is, apparently, rough equivalence,

Or could be non-equivalence —
MR. JONES:

Well, I don't think it could be said to

be non-equivalence except in those rare instances of — well,
perhaps, not so rare — but in those instances where the woman
has substantial independent wealth which the man will inherit
upon her death.
Other than in those situations, if he was, in fact,
dependent upon her at the time of her death, it is very
probable that he has lost support.

Support which Congress has

deemed he needs to have replaced.
QUESTION:

Well, now, what about the converse?

He

was not dependent upon her at the time of her death.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Then, he is ineligible for benefits.
Well, I know, but what's that got to do

with need now?
MR. JONES:

If he were not dependent upon her at the

time of her death, then he has lost little in the way of
support and can be presumed to be continuing on whatever
sources of support that he had in the past.

Now, it is true that this is not a means test.

It

18
does not definitively distinguish between those persons
acutely in need and those who are not,
QUESTION:

And to that extent, it's an administrative

convenience argument?
MR, JONES:

Well, I think that any support test, any

dependency test, is only roughly equivalent to need.

For

example, in Mathews v„ Lucas, last term, this Court upheld a
statute which imposed upon illegitimate children a dependency
test or support test, even though a similar test was not
imposed upon legitimate children.
The criterion was considered substantially rationally
related to a need to distinguish between those who would need
additional sy.pport and those who did not.

And this statute

serves exactly the same purpose.
Now, it is true that we have here, as we did in
Lucas, a problem of over-inclusiveness,

The statute provides

benefits to certain women, Federal — retired civil servants
%

and certain other women and the benefits are not made
available to similarly situated men.

But mere over“inclusive­

ness, without more, does not render a statute unconstitutional.
Now, let me backtrack for a moment to make a few
comments about the Wlesenfeld opinion upon which appellee
and the court below largely rely.
The Wlesenfeld opinion, it must be conceded, contains
language that, if taken at face value, would require the

19
widower's support test to be struck down*
and I quote:

The Court stated —

"The Constitution forbids gender based differ­

entiation, the results and the efforts of female workers
producing less protection for their families than is produced
by the efforts of men*"

;

But that statement cannot be lifted bodily and
applied out of context*

In the first place* the statement was

made with regard to a statute that the Court found had no
rational basis.
The Court's rational in Wiesenfeld was that the
statutory bar against father's benefits was inconsistent with
the legislative purpose providing children deprived of one
parent with the opportunity for the personal attention of the
other.
But neither that rationale nor any similar rationale
is available here.

The support test for widowers is fully

consistent* I submit, with the underlying legislative purpose
of restricting benefits to those groups that may largely be
presumed to be needy.
But secondly* if the statement in Wiesenfeld were
detached from its factual context* it would amount to a per se
constitutional rule.

Indeed* that's what appellee suggests

that it is.
But the due process clause affords no basis for such
a rule*

Such a flat declaration of what Congress may not do in

20
the Social Security Act would* I submit, constitute a radical
and an unwise departure from historical principles of equal
protection,
/

It would allow no weight to be given to governmental
interests that might be served by a particular gender“based
classification,

This Court has always given weight to such

interests in equal protection cases in the past and it should
do so here,
Mr» Chief Justice, I would like to reserve my
remaining time,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mrs, Ginsburgp
ORAL ARGUMENT OP RUTH BALER GINS BURG, ESQ,
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MRS, GINSBURG:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Leon Goldfarb's case concerns a differential in the
quality of social insurance accorded men and women.
Pursuant to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act,
payments into Social Security's Old Age and Survivor's
Insurance Program are exacted from gainfully employed men and
women without regard to the sex of the contributor.

Whether

the wage earner is a man or a. woman, equal earnings require
equa 1 c ont ributions.
In contrast to the gender neutral contribution system,

21
the program draws a sharp line between the sexes on the payout
side»

Benefits to a spouse available under a male wage earner's

account are not equally available under a female iiage earner's
ace ounfc*
The Court below ruled that this separate and un­
equal payout system discriminates invidiously against the
wage earning woman and her spouse*

That decision and all other,

five other, Federal court judgments on the same point solidly
anchor to this Court’s 1973 judgment in Fronfcle.ro y, Richardson,
and the 1975 decision in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld,
Thus, the issue on which this appeal turns is cleanly
posed.

Do Frontlero and Wiesenfeld impart a principled basis

for deciding gender discrimination cases formed from the same
mold, or are the Frontxero and Wiesenfeld precedents shallow
and evanescent, as the Secretary would have it today?
In Wiesenfeld, the Court declared unconstitutional
the Social Security Act provision of a mother's benefit, but
no father's benefit.

When Wiesenfeld was presented to this
fcWir Wi

Court, the Solicitor General described the gender differential
there at issue as very closely analogous to the one at bar.
And in Frontlero, the Court held unconstitutional a military
fringe benefit arrangement displaying a gender line virtually
identical to the one at bar.
In defending the Frontlero classification, the
Solicitor General noted similar distinctions are found in other

22
Federal laws,

He supplied as his sole example 42 U.S.C, 402,

the very Social Security provision now before the Court,
Like Steven Wiesenfeld and Sharon and Joseph
Frontiero, Leon Goldfarb challenged an employment-related
benefit scheme that attributes to the male wage earner status,
dignity and importance not attributed to the female wage
earner.
As the Secretary recites, the Old Age and Survivor's
Insurance at issue took shape in two stages.

First, in 1939*

Congress ordered that the male workers Social Security account
should attract benefits for his spouse without regard to
husband’s and wife's respective contributions to family Income.
QUESTION:

Mrs, Bader, may I interrupt here for

a moment?
MRS, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Ginsburg.

You heard what our friend, Mr, Jones,

had to say preliminarily about whether or not this is anti­
female discrimination or anti-male discrimination.

And I

suppose you would agree that it could be cast either way.
You cast it as anti-female discrimination, anti-female wage
earner discrimination.

It could be equally cast as anti-male

beneficiary discrimination.
But in any event, do you think there is any
constitutional difference?

Let's say the statute were —

wherever it says widow it said widower and vice versa.

Let’s

23
just turn the coin around and say the statute was the other
way.

Would it make any constitutional difference?

Would you

have just as strong and no more strong a constitutional argu­
ment?
MBS» GINSBURG:

The line drawn here* like virtually

every gender discrimination* is a two-edge sword.

It works

both ways„
QUESTION:

Because some of the opinions of this

Court* and other courts* have* when they have seen anti-female
discrimination* have relied for their constitutional decision
upon the history of anti-female discrimination.

There has

been no such history of anti-male discrimination, I guess, as
a matter of historic fact.
MRS. GINSBURG:

Because most anti-female discrimina­

tion was dressed up as discrimination favoring the woman.
QUESTION:

I know that.

I know that, but the

courts* through the help of advocates such as you* have been
able to see through that* haven't they?
(laughter)
MRS, GINSBURG:

The point is that the discriminatory

line almost inevitably hurts women —
QUESTION:

Well* my question is if this were purely

an anti-male discrimination, and let's assume it were, would
you have as strong a constitutional argument,in your view?
MRS. GINSBURG;

My argument would be the same because

24
I don't know of any purely anti-male discrimination.

In the

end.? the women are the ones who end up hurting.
QUESTION:

Suffering.

MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

1 should point out that in 1950, when Congress
authorized these benefits under the female workers' account?
the dependency test that was attached was a very stringent
dependency test'.

It was not a question of whether the woman —

QUESTION: Could I interrupt just to be sure I
understand your position in response to Justice Stewart?

Is

it your view that there is no discrimination against males?
MRS• GINSBURG:

I think there is discrimination

against males —
QUESTION:

If there is such discrimination? is it to

be tested by the same or by a different standard from dis­
crimination against females?
MRS. GINSBURG;

My response to that, Mr. Justice

Stevens, is that almost every discrimination that operates
against males operates against females, as well.
QUESTION:

Is that a yes or a no answer?

I just don't understand you and «*•»

Are you trying

to avoid the question or «—*
MRS. GINSBURG:
question,

No, I am not trying to avoid the

I am trying to clarify the position that I don't

know of any line that doesn't work as a two-edge sword, doesn't

25
hurt both sexes*
QUESTION:

We heard a case this morning, just to be

concrete, involving a law that would not permit males to make
certain purchases that females could make, and it was attacked
as discrimination against males,
MRS, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes,

My question is whether we should examine

that law under the same or a different standard than if it
were discrimination against the other sex,
MRS, GINSBURG:

My answer to that question is no,

in part, because such a law has an insidious impact against
females.

It stamps them docile, compliant, safe to be trusted

«5* ■*»*

QUESTION:

But your answer always depends on their

finding some discrimination against females.

You seem to put

that in every answer to this question,
MRS, GINSBURG:

My answer was that I have not yet

come across a statute that doesn’t have that effect,
QUESTION:

But, if there were one, you would say it

should be tested under a different standard, I take It*
MRS, GINSBURG:

If there were such a statute, I would

reserve judgment on what the standard should be*

In any case,

I have not come across such a statute in my -QUESTION;

So, your case depends, then, on our

analyzing this case as a discrimination against females*

26

MRS» GINSBURG:

No,

My case depends on your

recognition that using gender as a classification, resorting
to that classification is highly questionable and should be
closely reviewed»
QUESTION:

And is always, in fact, a discrimination

against females.
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes, as far as I have seen,

That's your position.

MRS. GINSBURG:

That that Is the ultimate effect of

such line“drawing.
QUESTION:

How do you put Mr. Justice Douglas’

opinion in Sheyin v, Kahn Into this colloquy you are having
with my brothers?
MRS» GINSBURG:

In Kahn v« Shevin, the Court

analyzed that classification as helpful to some women, harmful
to none.

If you accept that analysis, well, then, you might

rationalize that as a compensatory classification that could
survive constitutional review,

In addition, it was a very

small matter involved in Kahn —
MUMltofAXM

QUESTION:

Well, it did survive constitutional

scrutiny here.
MRS, GINSBURG:

Yes, but what we have in this case

is a classification that is harmful to women,
QUESTION:

Mrs, Ginsburg, speaking of the test which

is to be applied, it is rny understanding there has not been a

27
decision of the majority of the full Court that says in so
many i^ords that sex is a suspect classification,

Would you

*

say that the existing precedents from this Court require sex
to be scrutinized more or less carefully than a classification
based on illegitimacy, such as the one in Mathews v, Lucas,
last term?
MRS, GINSBURG:

Yes, I think that was the clear

indication of the Mathews v, Lucas decision,
QUESTION:

Well, the question is: which Is the

strictest scrutiny, sex or illegitimacy* in your construction
of our cases?
MRS, GINSBURG:

Sex,

Let me say that has been a

very recent development, because, as we know, at the time
these lines came into Social Security in 1939 and in 1950*
virtually anything goes was then the state of equal protection
lav; with respect to gender classification.

But anything goes

is certainly not the lawfas. to. genderac lass, if Ication today.
The equal protection principle is part of a
Constitution intended to govern American society as it evolved
over time and inevitably keeping pace with the nation's
progress toward maturity,

Notions of what constitutes the

equal protection of the laws do change and as to sex discrimin­
ation, they have changed,

Thus, the gender line in question

here is no more secure because it solidified in 1950 than it
would be if the program had taken shape in 1970,

28

The Court has not yet acknowledged sex as a suspect
criterion, but It has plainly identified the vice of legisla­
tive resort to gender pigeon-holeing.
Last term, in Mathews v* Lucas, Mr. Justice Blackmun,
writing for the Court, referred to the severity and pervasive­
ness of the historic legal and political discrimination against
women, discrimination made ever so easy because sex, like race
«C» OM

QUESTION:

Yet, that case upheld the classification

largely on a justification of administrative convenience,
didn't it?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Mathews v, Lucas did not involve a

sex classification —QUESTION:

No, a classification of illegitimacy.

MRS. GXNSBURG:

And in the process of so doing,

dlstinbuished sex classifications and race classifications,
both of which present, as Mr. Justice Blackmun said, "An
obvious bad."
Yes, women's history has been a history of purposeful
unequal treatment*

Women have been subjected to unique

disabilities based on sterotyped characteristics, not truly
vindicative of their abilities.
And, further, in Mathews v* Lucas, the Court pointed
to the generalization harmful to women underlying this one-way
three to one support test.

The woman spouse does not qualify

29
unless the woman supplied all of her own support, plus half
of his.

It is a 75$ support test at issue here.

It is not

enough that she earn 51$ of the family's income.
But the Court pointed out in Mathews v, Lucas that
such a gender specific classification reflects the familiar
overboard stereotypical assumption that earnings of men are
vital to the family and earnings of women are not.
But the Secretary has told you that this discrimination
in Old Age and Survivor's Insurance is discrimination helpful
to women, discrimination rationally responsive to the low
economic status of many wives and widows.
Yes, Congress did attend to the man's wife in 1939
in the same paternalistic spirit it attended to his children.
But the vaunted congressional attention to wives and widows
is expressed in a scheme that heaps further disadvantage on
the gainfully employed woman.
A law that benefits a woman as wife or widow, but
does not denigrate woman as wage earner might be rationalised
as benign and the gender criterion ranked as an appropriate
means to a legitimate end, but the Section 402 differential
cannot be rationalized as favorable to some women, harmful to
none,

The wage earning woman is disfavored, her work is

devalued when the earnings dollar she contributes to Social
Security is worth less in protection for her family than the
earnings dollar of an identically situated male worker.

30
In sum, the line Congress drew in Section 402 does
not ameliorate gender discrimination.

It does not alter

conditions that relegate women to an inferior place in political
and economic endeavor.

Rather, the gender line drawn in the

Old Age and Survivor's Insurance Program reflects and re­
inforces constraining stereotypes.
The differential favors and rewards men's employment
more than women's.

It casts the law's weight on the side of

arrangement in which man's work comes first, woman's second.
Together with other incentives, it helps steer the married
couple in one direction and discourages independent choice by
the pair,
QUESTION:

Mrs, Glnsburg, let me come back to

Kahn and Shevin again,
I really wasn't, too clear on whether you thought we
had decided that case wrongly or what your view Is.

That's

not too important, but in that case did we not hold that the
State had enacted there this special benefit for women that
was -- for widows not given to widowers, because »- and this
is the language of the opinions

"It was reasonably designed

to further a State policy of cushioning the financial impact of
spousal loss on the sex for which that loss imposes a dispro­
portionately heavy burden."
Now, isn't there something of that same undertone
In this case?

31
The critical difference is that in Kahn that small
tax break was unlikely to reinforce significantly —
QUESTION:

Well, does it make much difference whether

it is small or large on a constitutional basis?
MRS* GINSBURG:

The question — the critical issue

is whether the distinction reinforces stereotype characteriza­
tions of the way women or men are or whether such a line
influences men and women’s
QUESTION:

I should think a small benefit Blight be

more invidious as a sex stereotype than a large benefit,
wouldn’t it?
«

MRS* GINSBURG:

It is unlikely to affect the

decisions of men and women concerning the work that they do*
A $15 annual tax benefit is not likely to have such an impact,
but a Social Security differential, If it is a question of
which one will be the dominant breadwinner and if it is a
question of thousands of dollars, that can sway decisions one
way or another,

A $15 tax break is not likely to have that

.effect,
QUESTION:

So, what you are saying is that Congress

cannot legislate on the basis of the assumption that in the
great majority of cases the man is the primary, is the dominant
breadwinner in our society?
MRS, GINSBURG:

Congress can use a gender neutral

standard, but it can’t simply assume that the men are the

32
breadwinners and the women are the dependents.
QUESTION:

What is the fact* statistically?

MRS* GINSBURG:

The fact statistically, as to this

three to one dependency test* I think it is quite clear that
millions of American women could not meet such a test*
not a small group of women involved here.

It is

The Secretary has

noted that the median average contribution of the wife to
family income is 27’$.

Where she works full-time it is 38$, but

even 27$ is too high to qualify her under this three to one
dependency test.

So most women do not meet that test*

The Secretary's ultimate —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Ginsburg, could I ask: would you find

objectionable on equal protection or due process grounds an
application of the support test across the board to both men
and women?
MRS, GINSBURG:

If that's the line Congress chose to

draw, there would be, no problem with such a line*

A question

whether the legislature should do it —
QUESTION:

That's a different question, but you

couldn't, if Congress said our overall aim is to provide for
need and we are going to have a simple rule to serve that in,
namely a support test, and we are going to apply it to both
men and women*

You wouldn't find that objectionable?

MRS* GINSBURG:
infirmity with that line.

There would not be a constitutional

33
MRS. GINSBURG:

The Secretary's position here is that

— although this is not clearly stated as justification for
discrimination, it is cheaper to adhere to this gender
criterion but that is not necessarily true nor is it material
to this Court's function.
It should be underscored that the remedial issue in
this case calls for tentative adjudication, not final resolution,
by this Court.

Authority and responsibility for definitive

disposition remain with Congress.
Striking the gender criterion leaves to the
legislature the full range of gender neutral options.
may extend benefits, it may retract them.

Congress

It may apply across-»

the-board the half support test or a less blunt limitation.
This Court's interim disposition should be guided by
the preference Congress has consistently Indicated when a
gender line infects a benefit program.
The reshaping has taken the same form on each
occasion.

Removal of the gender based differential by dropping

the dependency test, that is the course unexcept .tonally recom­
mended in every official report recently made regarding gender
lines in Social Security, including the report so extensively
quoted in the Secretary's brief.
QUESTION:

What judgment would you — suppose you win

the case — what judgment, what kind of a judgment should the
Cfcurt enter?

Just a declaration —

34
MRSo GIMSBURG:

The Court should affirm the judgment

below,
QUESTION:

Nhich is just a declaration that the

distinction Is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds?
MRS, GIMSBURG:

It should affirm the decision below

which held the one-way dependency test unconstitutional.
The consequence of that was that Leon Goldfarb qualified for
benefits and is presently receiving them.
An application of across-the-board dependency test,
though open to Congress, is unlikely in view of the very
drastic program change that.approach would effect.

It would

remove from the beneficiary category not a small percentage of
wives and widows, as the Secretary asserted, but based on that
27$ figure, clearly millions of wives and widows would fail
that three to one dependency test.
Nor has the Secretary supplied a shred of evidence
in this case as to dollars saved by presuming the wives
dependent.

There vias a reference to a lower court hearing In

Maryland in the

JabIon case In which the Government counsel

did tender a guess that the administrative expense could run as
high as a billion dollars, but In a subsequent hearing
Government counsel stated that there was no factual basis,
whatever, for that figure or any other figure.

In short,

there is no factual basis in this record, nor in the record of
any other case, for a comparison of administrative dollars saved

35
as against benefit dollars paid out to wives and widows who
would be ineligible under the three to one dependency test.
Congress never attempted to determine whether any
saving would be effected by assuming men independent and women
dependent.

It appears that what Congress did have in mind in

1939 and 1950 was not so much administrative convenience as the
notion that husband,, whatever his actual earnings, ought to be
ranked the family's dominant breadwinner.

a

Further, as even the Secretary’s brief reveals, albeit
sotto voce, most of the husbands and widowers who would qualify
were this three to one support test eliminated, are not their
family’s principal breadwinners; rather, on the basis of the
i

Secretary's projection, the majority of these men earned less
than their wives.

The life's partner of these men are women

whose earnings range, from over 50# to just under 75# of family
income.
Finally, as to that cost camputation, the computation
introduced for the first time in the Secretary's brief to this
Cou.rt,

It is a one-eyed, illusive estimate that both exaggerates

and obscures.

It does not offset against new secondary bene­

ficiaries the ever-increasing extent to which wives and widows
are removed from that category because they qualify «s prims 3. j
beneficiaries entitled to maximum benefit under their own
accounts.

It does not take account'of the probability of

continued movement toward the announced congressional-goal of
universal Social Security coverage for all gainfully employed

36
persons,

-

It doss not place the estimate in context.

- .

The total sum the

Secretary conjectures amounts to just about two-thirds of 1%
of annual Social Security receipts. . In 1975* those receipts
exc eed ed $66,7 bi11ion„
And* significantly* it appears to hypothesize a
condition that does not correspond.to reality.

The projections

suppose that every newly eligible man would retire forthwith
as early as age 60 or 62 and take full advantage of his
eligibility.
Left out of the calculation is the Social Security
Act's vitally important retirement test,
not retire at ages 60 to 64,

Most individuals do

Many potential Social Security

recipients work well past age 65.
Leon Goldfarb* for example* retired when he was
approaching 67«
All potential Social Security beneficiaries under
age 72 are subject to the Act's retirement test j otherwise
eligible individuals under 72* if they have earnings in excess
of the income ceiling* will receive no benefits.
Under the retirement test* a high percentage of the
husbands and widowers counted by the Secretary as eligible
likely would receive no benefits at all* or would have their
benefits cut down substantially because they earn in excess of
$2*760* the current income ceiling for full benefits.

37
QUESTION:

Do you have any reliable figures on that.

Mrs. Ginsburg?

MRS a GINSBURG:

I have no access to figures concerning

the extent of people who could not get full benefits or whose
benefits would be reduced,
QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be likely a fluctuating

group?
MRS,, GINSBURG:

We know that the computation appears

to count every person who is eligible in that estimate, and
we know that it does not appear to take account of anybody
not retiring at first available opportunity,
QUESTION:

Is it possible that that's why they

revised their figures downward from a billion dollars to
$400 and some million?
MRS, GINSBURG:
downward.

They have never revised the figures

The billion dollars was suggested once as the cost

of applying the dependency test to wives, requiring wives to
prove that they supplied less than a quarter of the total
family income.

But that billion dollars had nothing to do

with this estimate.

This estimate has escalated.

In the

Wiescnfeld case, it was suggested that it was $300 million,,
now It is up to $447 million.
But it appears that no account was taken of the
retirement test and that is a significant omission and it is
underscored by the emphasis that the Social Security

/

38
Administration has placed on the enormous expense of eliminating
or scaling down the retirement c es e through 1egisla tive
revision.
In any event*

it is impossible to rationalise

a gender criterion allocating benefits on the ground that it
is cheaper to proceed that way.

If all that is required to

uphold the statutory classification is the conclusion that
it effects economies, then any statutory scheme can be
established and no arbitrarily excluded group can complain.
Decades ago* now Senior Federal District Court Judge
Bernifca Shelton Mathews in. her days at the bar as counsel to
the National Women's Party* explained like why a gender line
such as the one at bar helps to keep women not on a pedestal
but in a cage.

Such classification* she said:

"Fortifies the

assumption harmful to women that labor for pay with attendant
’or one's family3 is primarily the prerogative of
men,"
Appellee Goldfarb respectfully requests that the
judgment below be affirmed* thereby establishing that under
the equal protection principle the women worker's national
social insurance is of no less value than is the social
insurance of the working man,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr, Jones.,

Thank you* Mrs, GInsburg,

do you have anything

39
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A, JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR * JONES:

Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

I would like to' point out that the beneficiaries
with which vie are largely concerned here are retired civil
servants who receive Government pensions, and that this Court
should not lightly require the largely irrational distribution
of benefits that the appellee seeks.
The appellee's arguments here largely depend on
changing employment statistics.

His reliance is upon the

fact that today, very much unlike 1939 and 195°-? there is a
substantial proportion of non-dependent women in the job
market, perhaps as high as 20$ at this point, or roughly in
that area,
QUESTION:

Mr, Jones, do you think the constitutionality

of this statute turns on the statistics as they existed in 1939,
1950 or today?
MR0 JONES:

Mr. Justice Stevens, if you believe that

this statute was constitutional when first enacted and that
recent social history has largely eroded the factual basis on
which the classification originally depended, I would think
that the appropriate remedy would not be to determine, in the
first instance, that this statute is unconstitutional.
I do not think that this Court should sit as a
committee of revision on the Social Security Act, in the first

40
instance,,
It seems to me that if you believe that recent social
history has undercut the foundation of the Act in this respect,
you should advise Congress of the fact that changing events
have cast serious doubt upon the continued viability of this
distinction, that you should give to Congress the opportunity
to sort out this very complicated matter which, no matter how
this Court would dispose of it, would result in an irrational
and unfair allocation of Social Security monies.
QUESTION:

Let me change the question a little bit.

Supposing we were convinced that the statute was constitutional
in 1950 and that conditions have totally changed

whenever vie

get to the case, would we be bound to say it is still con­
stitutional?
MR. JONES:

I think that to give due deference to

Congress which has the primary responsibility of sorting out
the difficult questions of the proper allocation of Social
Security monies, it would be appropriate for this Court to
hold at this point that the statute remains constitutional,
but advise Congress that if current social trends continue,
the factual basis for that finding of constitutionality will
have been completely eroded, but give to Congress some oppor­
tunity to sort out —
QUESTION:
a letter?

How would'we advise Congress, send them

MR. JONES:

Well, I think that an opinion to the

effect would sufficiently apprise Congress of your —
QUESTION:

Are you sure they would read it?

QUESTION:

This is an odd role.that you are

recommending for this Court.
MR, JONES:

Well., it is not unlike the role you .

played in the Federal Election Commission case.
QUESTION:

A half a dozen cases can be cited.

QUESTION:

Sorry to hear that»

(laughter)

QUESTION:

A half a dozen cases can be cited where

the Court has done almost precisely what you have suggested
in making recommendations without legislation.
MR, JONES:

Well, I think that in a matter such as

this where to affirm the decision below would require new
allocation of benefits, that it just makes plain good sense
to give Congress the primary opportunity to take care of what
seemed to be an unfair allocation.
QUESTION:

You say that the statute is constitutional

or unc ons titutiona1?
MR0 JONES:
QUESTION:

Constitutional,
We would say that it is constitutional

despite the fact that we think it is unconstitutional?
(laughter)
MR, JONES:

Well, I submit that the fact that more

42
women are now in the job market than in 1939 does not at this
point, standing alone, necessitate a finding of unconstitution­
ality,

I do not think we have yet reached that point.

My submission is that —
QUESTION:

1 didn't think j^our primary -- one of your

points anyway, early in your argument, was that the fact that
you are paying widows something you weren't paying widowers
didn't prove unconstitutionality.

You said Congress1 aim is to

take care of needy people,
MR, JONES:

The appellee's argument, as I understand

it, is that v;hat was once over-Inclusiveness as to 5 to 10$
of the women, is new over-inclusiveness as to, perhaps, 20 to
25$ of women.

It may well be that — and I would submit the

contrary — but it may well be that if the Court concludes that
that kind of broad over-Indus I veness is of doubtful con­
stitutionality, it might apprise Congress of that fact.
My submission would be that mere over-1nclus1veness
without more, does not render the statute unconstitutional,
that the statute need not be mathematically precise as to —
QUESTION:

What If it was 30$* instead of 2$, would

you say that degree of over-Inclusiveness is another matter?
MR, JONES:

Well, it is a matter of degree.

If it

were 100$, then, obviously, it would be very difficult to
sustain.

Where 30$ stands in relation to that, other than

being about 30$ toward 100$, I am not sure 1 am prepared to say

43
at this moment.
Thank you,
MR* CHIEF JUSTIC3 BURGSR:

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

Thank you, Mrs. Ginsburg.
The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:01 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
