MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in Marks against the United States.
Have you completed your presentation, Mr. Smith?
MR. SMITH;

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT IT. BORIC, ESO. ,
OtI BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
It has become apparent by now the Government has
confessed error on two of the three issues in this case.
\

And we think that it is clear that we were required to do
so, and I'll explain why briefly.
The prosecution here, of course, took place after
the decision of this Court in Miller against California.

But

it was for conduct that occurred prior to the Miller decision.
That was at a time when the governing law in this area was
that announced in Roth against the United States, and
substantially modified by Memoirs against Massachusetts.
In a word, petitioners acted at a time when the
law required that their materials, their films, be shown
to be utterly without redeeming social value.

But the jury

was charged under the Miller standard, which requires that
the work, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic,

21
political, or scientific value»
That there is a difference between the two standards
is evident, and that was recognized in the Miller decision
itself, which said that the Memoirs represented a sharp
break with Roth.

And that was recognized again in Hamblin

against United States.
It was also clear that Miller represented a swing
back towards the original understanding of the Roth decision,
although it refined the Roth standards greatly.

And it

seems clear, therefore, that the petitioners were tried under
a standard that gave the prosecution less of a burden —
considerably less of a burden — than the law provided at
the time they acted.
It has been suggested that the test enunciated by
the three judges in Memoirs never became the law, because
it never commanded the adherence of a majority of this Court.
Therefore it is said, Roth remained the lax-?, and since Miller
is like Roth, petitioners got the jury instruction they were
entitled to, or something close to it.
That argument, I must say, unhappily, seems to me
not to hold water.

If the Memoirs plurality was not the lav?,

then one of two things would have followed; and I think
either is inadmissible.

Either there was no law at all

between Memoirs and Miller, in which there would be no basis
for any prosecution of conduct occurrincr during those

22

eight years, or Roth remained the law, despite the fact that
any conviction obtained under Roth would be reversed, because
three justices adhered to Memoirs, and two justices thought
that no obscenity conviction could stand up.
Moreover, in Re dr up against Rev? York ,

and the

cases thereafter up to Miller, this Court reviewed allegedly
obscene materials on the basis of the differing views of the
justices, and reversed in over thirty cases.
that there was law during that period.

So it is plain

Arid I think it's plain,

therefore, that it consisted effectively of the plurality
opinion in Memoirs.

Moreover, I think that the opinion of

Hamblin against the United States, which sustained a conviction
of pre-Miller conduct, also shows that Roth-Memoirs was the
law during the period.
Nov/, even though that is Court-made law, it is
effectively read into the statute.

And I don't think there

is any way that a charge that the change that occurred in
Miller could be retroactively be applied to these petitioners.
That would deny them due process of law.
Roth the district court and the Court of Appeals
tried to distinguish Bouie against City of Columbia.

And

I don't think the principles in these two cases can be
distinguished because here Miller relaxed the constitutional
rules which had previously been applied, and that has the
effect — is indistinguishable from reading a statute to

cover conduct which it previously did not cover.

And for

that reason, the Goyernnent thinks the petitioners are
entitled to a new trial with a properly instructed jury.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, as I

understand the state of the law on this particular question,
when it comes here from the Sixth Circuit, the Government
had this case and another court of appeals decision with
it, several other courts of appeals decisions against it.
Don't you think the Solicitor General has some responsibility
under the adversary system when there's a plausible argument
to be made in support of affirming a judgement that has gone
in favor of the government to make that argument, rather than
simply adopt what he thinks is the lav/?
MR. BORIC:

T do indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And we have considered this case, this principle, for at
least three years now.

And if I thought there were a

plausible case to be made for applying Miller standards to
pre-Miller conduct I would certainly make that argument.
QUESTION:

Well, what you're saying then when you

say you don't think a plausible case can be made is that
two courts of appeals presumably consisting of judges
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate,
have reached a totally implausible result.

The Government

is unwilling even to argue in favor of it in this Court.
MR. BORIC:

That, in effect, is correct, Mr. Justice

24
Rehnquist.

Those courts of appeals* quite unfortunately

from my point of view, because I would like to be able to
argue to uphold these convictions, and I deplore the waste
of resources that has gone into some prosecutions that
must now be re-prosecuted —
QUESTION:

Well, how —

MR. BORKs

But nothing in those courts of appeals,

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, opinions gave me any — I thought —
any intellectually defensible way to defend the convictions
here.
QUESTION:

Well, how is this Court supposed to function

in that kind of a situation?
of an adversary process.

We are supposedly the beneficiari.es

And I am sure we would look with gret

scepticism if Mr. Smith had come here in the position that
you are now, and said he represented his clients, and he
realized he had a couple of courts of appeals cases going
for him, but he just couldn't in good conscience say that
their judgement should be reversed.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think the answer can only be

that the government feels it has an obligation not only to
the adversary process but also to the law and to justice.
And in a case where it thinks an injustice has been done, and
that there is no intellectually defensible way of supporting
a conviction, I think that the Government must say so.
QUESTION:

But isn't that ultimately the responsibility

25
of this Court?

To decide whether or not an injustice has

been done, or whether or not a particular conviction should
be upheld or reversed?
HR. BGRK:

It is indeed, Hr. Justice Rehnquist —

QUESTION;

And aren't we best served by an adversary

presentation in making that determination?
HR. BORK:

Well, I trust we also have an obligation

to the Court to tell it when we think there is no adversary
case that can be made.

That has been done many times by the

Solicitor General's office, and there have been occasions
when the confession of error has been rejected by this
Court.
QUESTION;

I take it your position, Hr. Solicitor

General, is not intended to impinge upon our ultimate
authority to decide the case the way it’s being decided?
HR. BORK:

It is certainly not so intended, Mr.

Chief Justice, and I am certain it will not have that effect.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, is the policy of

confessing error when you find there's no intellectually
defensible way of defending the result below, is this a
new policy that the Solicitor General's office has just
adopted, or is this something that has gone on for many,
many years?
HR. BORK:

Hr. Justice Stevens, it has gone on since

the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.

26

QUESTION:

Do you know whether you apply a different

standard in making these determinations than has been
applied in the past?
MR, BORK:

I believe that I apply the standard that

most Solicitor Generals applied, but some have deviated.

My

stand is, that if the Government has a respectable position,
I will defend it regardless of my personal view in the matter.
Ily personal views in this case are that I would dearly
love to defend this conviction.
QUESTION:

I don't think I can.

Do you consider this practice of your

office different from the practice of some defense counsels
?

#521

from time to time of filing Anders briefs?
Is

it not true that defense counsels sometimes feel

in good conscience they have no appealable point, and
therefore in effect, so acknowledge to the Court?
MR. BORK:

I think the private bar does that, Mr.

Justice Stevens —
QUESTION:

And professionally, is there any differences

between the two in your judgement?
MR. BORK:

No, I think there is less — if I may

say so, there is no difference in the professional obligations,
I think the government obviously has slightly legs pressure
than some members of the private bar may feel.

But I think

there is no difference, ultimately, in the obligation to
the Court.

27

QUESTION:

Do you know of any other cases where

the Government has come to the Court in this posture where
there are splits among the courts of appeals?
MR. BORK:

I do not recall offhand, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION s

Hava you ever heard of a private counsel

doing it in these circumstances?
MR. BORK:

I have not heard of it.

QUESTION:

And I doubt if you will either.

QUESTION:

I trust, Mr. Solicitor General, that

you're aware of the reaction of federal courts of appeals
judges when the United States Attorney has prosecuted a
case, and it is then affirmed, only to have the rug pulled
out from under them up here?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I'm aware of the

reaction of the courts.
United States Attorneys.

I’m also aware of the reaction from
I’ve been made aware of that.

Nevertheless, it seems to me I have an obligation to
do this.

And, unpleasant as it may be for me and for the

Court and for the U.S. Attorney, I do do it.

Three years

ago, I decided that this was the rule of law, and communicated
that fact.

Unfortunately, that decision was not communicated

apparently to the United States Attorneys.

So that some of

them -—
QUESTION:

Do you think it might have been a good

idea had we appointed counsel to argue in your stead?

28
HR. BORIC:

It night have been, Hr. Justice Rehnquist.

We confessed error in the brief.

So that I think it comes

as no surprise at all that we would take this position here
this morning.
QUESTION:

And you are taking it, I gather, from

reading in the newspapers, in similar cases around the country
HR. BORK:

Oh, yes.

We — there are some prosecution

for example, in Memphis.
QUESTION:

Yes.

HR. BORK:

Which will be affected by this.

I think our position on that is adequately
explained by what I've said, and adequately explained in our
brief.

I reiterate that were there an argument to be made

the other way, I would — in my opinion, I would gladly
make it.
I think the remaining two points are rather simpler.
We think the Court of Appeals was required as a statutory
matter -— I don't think the constitutional question need be
reached — was required as a statutory matter to look at these
materials.
not true.

Now there are undoubtedly cases in which that is
But here, there was really almost no descriptive

matter in the record about the nature of these films, except
that contained in the affidavit made by an F.B.I. agent
in obtaining search warrants, an ex parte statement not
subject to cross-examination, not required to put the

29

matters into context.

So that if there was to be any

effective appellate reviex* in this case, I think in this case
the court of appeals is required to look at the materials.
There may be cases in which there are stipulations,
there may be cases in which the testimony is sufficient without
viewing the materials.
true.

But in this case, neither of those is

28 U.S.C. 91 provides for an appeal, and that takes

up all issues that are properly reserved.

And I don't see how

that could be decided on the basis of the record here,
except by viewing the films.
How, I don't — we have said in our brief that
normally that’s sufficient.

There is no need for this

Court to review such materials unlessthey specifically take
the case up in order to do so.
The petitioners —- and I'm relieved, if I may say,
to come to a point where I disagree with the petitioners —
have argued that the tii 1 court's instruction to the jury to
assess the films in accordance with the contemporary standards
of the community standards generally held throughout the
Eastern District of Kentucky, was erroneous.

Because the

jury should have been instructed to apply the standards of
the Cincinnati metropolitan area from which — where some
of them lived, and some of them worked.
I should say that there argument does not support
that conclusion.

Because the Cincinnati metropolitan area

30

is certainly no more relevant in any sense than is the
Eastern District of Kentucky.

The jurors here did not

live throughout the Cincinnati metropolitan area any more
than they lived throughout the Eastern District of Kentucky.
Moreover, they were drawn from a pool which included
a widespread geographic -— had a t/idespread geographic dis­
tribution of available jurors.

If the panel did not have

as widespread a distribution as petitioners would have
liked, certainly no objection was made to that at the time.
But I think in any event, I don't think that an
objection would have been availing, nor do I think it should
have been.

The issue is simply not one of constitutional ...

dimensions.

The Hamblin decision indicates that normally

the relevant community will be the judicial district in which
the trial takes place.
Jenkins against Georgia referred to an instruction
which it did not disapprove of which merely referred to
community standards without defining the community.
QUESTION :

You say that was approved or disapproved,

MR. BORK:

Without disapproval, I said.

QUESTION:

Without disapproval.

MR. BORK:

It was merely referred to, ?tr. Justice

that —

Stewart, without disapproval.
I think these cases could be easily made absolutely

31

impossible if every obscenity conviction —■ or prosecution —
involved a search for the single relevant community.
There are endless numbers of possibly relevant communities.
Suburb cities, countryside, one could define in a way.

And

one could turn these into a search for the definition of the
relevant community which would make market definition in an
anti-trust case look simple.
QUESTION;

Of course in this particular case anybody

familiar with the Cincinnati community knows that Newport,
Kentucky, is part of greater Cincinnati, and that is the
community.
MR. BORK:

That is true.

QUESTION:

Accepting your proposition that in many

cases it would be difficult, and lead off to a wild goose
chase, in this particular case, it really isn’t for anybody
familiar with the greater Cincinnati community.
MR. BORK;

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't know

why the jurors who lived throughout — who do not live througout
the greater Cincinnati community —
QUESTION:

Well, anybody who lives in Newport does.

MR. BORK;

Throughout the vicinity?

QUESTION;

No, anybody who lives in Newport, Kentucky,

lives in the greater Cincinnati
MR. BORK:
that.

It’s in the metropolitan area, I understand

But I was — he equally lives in the Eastern District,

32

and I suppose there would be variations in community
standards throughout the metropolitan area of Cincinnati, just
as there may be throughout the Eastern District of Kentucky,
QUESTION:

But I take it that would be no more true

in that setting than it would be to say that Arlington is
part of the metropolitan Washington area?
MR. BORK:

I take it that would be true, Mr. Chief

Justice, but I —
QUESTION:

Or in Alexandria, it9s very comparable.

Although Newport,Kentucky is not quite like Arlington or
Alexandria.
MR. BORK:

I —

QUESTION:

Or vice versa.

MR. BORK:

— think the point of the relevant

community, or the community whose standard, in a constitutional
sense, is that the main function of requiring a reference to
community standards is to give the jurors some standard
extrinsic to themselves to which they may refer to attempt,
insofar as the law can by instructions in any jury case, to
make sure that peculiar or perhaps idiosyncratic sensibilities
of individual
jurors does not control the case, but that the
s...
juror is referred to a wider community.
And in that sense, I think, the function — that
function, which is the main function, I think, of that standard,
was served here by this instruction as well as it could have

33

been by choosing another possibly relevant community.
QUESTION:
little puzzled.

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, I'm a

Is the purpose of the community standard

to draw on the frame of reference that the juror normally
looks to, such as the district from which the venire is drawn;
or is it to look at the market — the economic market in
which the challenged film is exhibited.

Which would be

the more relevant?
MR. BQRKs

Well, the economic market, Mr. Justice

Stevens, I'm not -- I think the function —- I think the
primary function is to refer the juror to something outside
his own sensibilities.

Secondarily, it is to provide him with

a community with which he is more or less familiar, and to
have that community surrounding the area in which the films are
shown.

And I think all of those functions were served here

by this instruction.
QUESTION:

Well, the problem is that I think that

the many people who are familiar with it would say that
the Eastern District of Kentucky simply is not a community.
Community involves the word common, people who have something
in common.

And --

MR. BORK:

Well, of course --

QUESTION:

— the Cincinnati community is a community.

The Eastern District of Kentucky very arguably is not one.
It s residents within its borders just do not — by — since

34

they do not share something in common, they — it's not a
community.
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice —

QUESTION:

It's a geographic accident.

MR. BORK:

Well, I suppose in some sense, Mr. Justice

Stewart, so is the State of California a geographic accident.
Certainly it contains within itself widely disparate kinds
of communities.

And an instruction applying California wide

community standards has been upheld by this Court.

In

Jenkins against Georgia, a reference simply to community
standards, without defining which community, went by.
Hamblin, of course, suggests that normally it will be the
judicial district from which the venire is — comes which will
provide the community standards.

I have no desire to say

that there is any — in a case there is any single community
which controls — and I think indeed it would become impossibles
if that were to become the rule.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, let me put the

same question just a little differently.

I know the record

does not show this, but your reference to the anti-trust relevant
market raised the question in my mind.

.Supposing the

evidence here included a market study which showed that every­
body who attended this theater was a resident of Cincinnati.
Would you then say that the Kentucky District would be an
appropriate frame of reference to judge the films by?

35

MR. BORK:

Would it have been inappropriate?

QUESTION:

Would the instruction have been all right

under that situation?
MR. BORK:
Stevens.

I think it would have been, Mr. Justice

I think it would have also been possible to iise the

Cincinnati metropolitan area as a community.
QUESTION:
#672

I understand.

You say that would be an

alternative.
But even if no one came from the community which is
used as a frame of reference, you say that would still
comport with the test?
MR. BORK:

Well, I don’t know that no one comes —

QUESTION:

No one who saw the films that are challenged

MR. BORK:

Oh, you mean to say that, although the

did.

films were shown in the Eastern District
QUESTION:

of Kentucky —

If nobody who attended-the theater

happened to come across the river from Cincinnati on the
>

night that they were seised, just to take an extreme example.
MR. BORK:
suppose — ever.

Or take a more extreme example, I
That people always came —

QUESTION:

Yeah.

MR. BORK:

That is a question that seems to me to

drive us to the ultimate question of what the obscenity
laws are designed to do.

I think one answer would suggest

36

that the Eastern District of Kentucky was not the proper
area; that is, the obscenity laws in some part are intended
to control the effect of the obscenity upon the people who
view it.
But there’s a second function of the obscenity laws,
which is, I think, the sense of outrage and moral disapproval,
in a sense, that something is going on in their community
of which they deeply disapprove, even if none of them
actually go to the theater.

And in that function of the

obscenity laws —- which I think is a legitimate one —
would suggest that you might use the Eastern District of
Kentucky even if nobody from that District came there.
QUESTION:

Isn’t the hypothesis one that could not

be supported unless you had someone standing outside the
door of the theaters at all times taking census of the location
and address of the persons entering the theater?
MR. BORK:

Oh, I think it's _~

QUESTION:

That is, is it anything that can be

determined by a market survey the way we determine that -or try to determine it —* in an anti-trust case?
MR. BORK:
quite right.

No, I think Mr. Chio.f Justice that’s

It could not, as a pra ctical matter, be done.

Moreover, I would doubt very much if nobody from further
out in the Eastern District ever goes to these films.

But

I took it be a question designed to probe the philosophical

37

underpinnings of my argument, and I have just responded with
such philosophical underpinning as I could muster„
I have no further statement to make in the case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Smith, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Yes, briefly.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court, in Hiller v. California opinion,
authored by the Chief Justice, talked on page 32 in part,
it is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read
the First Amendment as requiring people of Maine or Mississippi
to accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las
Vegas or New York City.

And then the Court went on to say

people in different states vary in their taste and attitudes,
and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism
of imposed uniformity.
We suggest that by carving out an artificial district
and saying the Eastern District of Kentucky, that that is in
effect what courts are doing, and we suggest ignoring what I
think the words of this Court were in Miller.

I think that

the concept of Jenkins was a sound one, that is to say,
talking in general terms of the community, where social

38

intercourse occurs, where people feel a sense of belonging to
the community.

But to say the Eastern District of Kentucky,

as broad as it is geographically and as broad as it is in
attitudes, we suggest is an improper uniform standard that’s
just too absolute and should be rejected in this instance.
QUESTION:

That statement you read — or I'll put it

as a question — did not that statement that you read
reflect essentially Chief Justice Warren's expression in,
I think, either the Roth or the Memoirs case, that there
cannot realistically be such a thing as a national standard?
HR. SMITH:

I think that it does.

But it's your

that you’re making a contrast between states and between
cities.

Las Vegas and New York State.
cities.

It talked about states versus

people should not be strangled by the imposition of an abso­
lute standard in terms of the geographic — I suggest — I

39

read it to mean an absolute geographical standard.

And I say

that that’s what I find intolerable here.
Of course Justice Rehnquist in his argument — or
his opinion of this Court in the Hamblin case, did allow the
Court to suggest that the trial judge would have some
discretion in allowing evidence of community standards in
communities other than that from where the jury is sitting.
Mr. Justice Stevens asked about the concept of community
standard in terms of a market research program where you find
j

out that everybody came from another community.

Well, there

are cases that are working their way up in the federal system
where the film, let's say, is delivered from California to
Memphis, Tennessee, and has never been shovm in Memphis,
Tennessee.

It was not designed to be shown in Memphis,

Tennessee.

Absolutely no evidence that it had anything

more than it touched that area from the standpoint of
distribution.
the concept?

Mow, what community do we put there?

In

Do we put the community from which it came?

The community where it was intended to be shown?

And if

you're going to put geographical limits, you're going to have
these problems that present themselves.

So I think it's

not just philosophical, to answer Mr. Justice Stevens’
question.

There are cases where there is no showing that

the film has ever been depicted or exhibited in that
community, none whatsoever, yet that’s the community standard

40

that has been employed.
And so, with that I’ll rest.
Thank yon.
ftR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:32 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
