We will resume arguments

Mr» Dunlavey, you may proceed whenever you’re

reedy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN C. DUNLAVEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DUNLAVEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

r

the Courts
I am counsel for all respondents in the two cases
that are under review in this single certiorari.

On© is

Rath and involves meat,, in particular, bacon is the example!
and deals with the Wholesome Meat Act.

The second involves

flour and deals with the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Til© certiorari also involves one California statute,
which is a weight inspection statute, and one California
regulation that implements that statuta.
I hasten to point out to th© Court that th© case
does not now and '.never has involved Handbook 67, which is
something that has been brought into -th© briefs on certiorari.
There is only a single question presented by th©
petitioner in this certiorari, and that is:
law preempted the State?

Has the federal

And that is limited to a consideration

of preemption of the net weight labeling requirements on these
two products.

27

Tins quality of the product or wholesomeness of the
product is not new and nearer has been, an issue in the ease»
In response feo a question from Mr» Justice White
yesterdays the question before the Court in this certiorari
does not involve jurisdiction or, more properly# as it
arose in another petition# comity»

Jurisdiction or comity

has never been an issue in th® flour case» It is not in issue
in this certiorari# and it has not been

dealt with by any

brief on the merits in this certiorari*
It doesn’t —*
QUESTIONS

Are there different federal statutes

involved — or three?
MR» DUNLAVEY3

Wholesome Meat# asto the

Rath; Fair Packing and Labeling and Food# Drug# and Cosmetic
as to the flour,
QUESTION:

And it’s possible you could get different

answers as to bacon and flour# I take it?
MR, DUNLAVEY:

I think that the answers are the same#

but the reasoning will fa® different,
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR, DUNLAVEY:

And I might add that there is a

third case lurking beneath this certiorari# which was
entitled Becker va, Rath,
Becker was a counterpart of Jones in Los Angeles
County# whereas Jones is in Riverside County. The Becker case

28
was tried by the district court, and when the trial had
finished, the Jones vs, Rath case was consolidated with it,
it was argued separately? and a single judgment was issued by
tha district court in those two cases.
Following those, the flour case was adjudicated by
fch© same judge in a second opinion, and of course the Ninth
Circuit dealt with the two Rath cases as a single on® in its
decision.
The jurisdiction was an issue at one point in the
Becker case, but certiorari has not been granted in the Becker
case.
However, the Becker record is before the Court for
evidentiary purposes on this certiorari.
QUESTION!

What was the jurisdictional question?

MR. DUNLAVEY2

There had been a State court action

between Rath and both Becker and Jones in California, it
involved different statutes, did not involve the off-sale
procedure, but it antedated the federal cases by one weak.
And there was always an attempt to induce the federal court
to stay its hand while the State court went along.
But the two cases were unrelated and were recognized
as unrelated, and they progressed separately, each to judgment,
in fact..
The question arises from the fact that these are
prepackaged foods, and the law requires that they have a label

29

on them that tells what the net weight shall be.

In the case

of bacon it’s a on® pound net weight statement that' appears
on the package.

In th© case of flour, it can b© two pounds 02'

five pounds or ten pounds or twenty-five pounds.

But an

even number of pounds that is prescribed by California law.
The packages are preprinted so th® issue is:

How

close do you have to come when you put the product into the
package to correlate with th© label that's already printed on
it?
One thing that occur.© to most people is: why don't
you simply say it was on© pound when packaged?
Tha answer is, you cannot.
Federal law, each of these federal laws -and th®
regulations under them, and California, to boot, preclude any
kind of a qualification statement on the label.

It has to say,

flat, what tii@ weight, is, and not qualify it in any way.
Each of th© federal laws that's involved in the
certiorari starts off by saying ‘that th© label is required to
have an accurate statement of weight on it.
How, if you take that literally, if th© bacon package
says one pound, then thar© would have to be on® pound of baccn
in it, no more and no lass.

That would ba an impossible

requirement for all practical purposes, you can't turn these
food products into equivalents of a jeweler's balance.
The statute permits the respective agencies to

30
promulgate regulations that will provide for reasonable
variation from this exact statutory requirement»

The agencies

involved have done that as to ©sch of these products»

The

regulations are essentially the sama( except in one case they
are permissive..» in the other case they are mandatory , but in
each case the agency has don© it, so it really doesn't
matter»
Those reasonable variations have been of two kinds ,
and there's a long history behind each of them.
The first is an unavoidable deviation that, stems from
good manufacturing practice»

Now,, that is simply a

recognition that you can't put an exact weight into the package.
It's a particularly aggravated situation with bacon, because
the bacon slicer turns out an increment of slices, about 16
or 20 of them, that you find in your household package, which
coma pretty close to a pound? but, of course, it's not
accurst©.
It then goes to a seal®, and a human being has to
bring the weight of that increment into a reasonable correla­
tion with a one-pound accuracy? and it's don© by putting on
or talcing off a slice or a half slice, maybe a -third of a slice,
but that's about as far down as you go.
The industry’s answer to that is to have what's
called a pass zone, which means that ten-sixteenths
QUESTION;

What do they call it?

31

MR. DUNLAVEY:
QUESTION s

A pass zon®„

P-a-s-s zone.

Yes.
i

MR. DUNLAVEYs

At the center of th© pass zone is a

target weight, and in the casa of bacon, before this litigation
arose, it was three-sixteenths of an ounce over on© pound.
That was -the target that they were shooting at.
Now, you can’t hit three-sixteenths over any more
easily than you can hit an even pound, so then comes the
pass zone, which says it will be acceptable if any given
package of bacon is within five-sixteenths of an ounce over
the target weight or five-sixtasnths of an ounce under the
target weight, anywhere in that pass zone will b© acceptable.
And probability tell us that that target weight
turns out to be the average weight.
Th© point is that when you* re dealing with a product
like bacon, where you have, say, 16 or 20 units that you us®
to male© a pound, you can only com© so close.

In flour, which,

of course, is a powder, it's poured into th© bag until it
reaches the labeled weight or .approximately that.
Once again you have a target weight, but the pass
zone doesn't have to b© as broad foecaus© you can com© much
closer to accurate weight when you’re measuring out © powder
than when you're measuring out a strip of bacon.
But th© point now has been made that when'you* re
dealing with different products, you have to allow for

32

differant amounts of unavoidable deviation in the course of
good manufacturing practice.
In this case there is no question# no issue# that
when these products were shipped# the products had an average
weight that was accurate.

As a matter of fact# in the case of

each of them# it would jut be slightly over#enough to be sure
that ns happenstance had thrown the average below.

But we

will say that the averages were accurate when the products
were shipped from the plant.
If you looked at any individual package# it would
deviate from that accuracy only because of the manufacturing
problem that I have just described.

That would be the reason

for any deviation.
Now, each of those products bears moisture.

The hog

is about, or over fifty percent water; the flour is about 14
percent water.
QUESTION:

You also put water into the bacon

aft® swards.
MR. DUNLAWJYi

Not afterwards, Your Honor.

You put

water and salt solutions into the hog carcass in the process
of curing it# but the law requires you -to dry it all out
before you ship the product.
QUESTION:

You don't put water in the bacon?

MR. DUNLAVEY:

You don't —» when you ship the bacon#

it, has no more water in it than the natural hog —

33

QUESTIONS

No, but don’t you put it in before you

cut it?
MR. DUNLAVEYs
QUESTION:

Not — you put water —

Before you slice it?

MRo DUNLAVEYs

You put water with a salt solution

into the bacon and cur® it, then you dry it and hear, it, and
that water comes back out again.

Has to.

So that water is not

part of the problem.
QUESTION: Wall, what is that you get in the pan when
you cook bacon that's not grease?
MR. DUNLAVEYs
QUESTIONs

Beg your pardon. Justice?

What is the substance in the pan when you

cook bacon that is not grease?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

Water.

Well, the water will have boiled out,

I would submit, it probably is liquid grease.
come out, there's no question about it.

But water does

You see the steam

rising off the pan, and that's the water vapor leaving the
bacon.
These packages that the products are in are paper.
They are sealed.

They are pretty well sealed.

But the paper

is porous, idie sealing is not moisture-tight, and so those
products are going -to lose some of their natural moisture
content between the time that the manufacturer packages them
and the time the consumer picks them up.
QUESTION:

Now, you say "some"; on the average, how

34

much?
MR. DUNLAVEYs
cent .

I would say,on the average,, two per­

That's been 'the amount —
QUESTIONS

on both flour and bacon?

MR. DUN LAVE Y:
QUESTION:

Yes.

For flour —•

But flour could gain.

Flour is hygro­

scopic, isn't it?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

Flour is hygroscopic, and flour can

gain at a relativa humidity in excess of 60 percent.

Obviously

these cases don’t involve —
QUESTION: Bacon is always going to lose, —
MR. DUNLAVEY:

Bacon is a one-way street, it will

always lose.
QUESTION:

— flour can lose or gain?

MR. DUNLAVEY:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice,Stewart.

So the federal regulation says that moisture loss or
gain that comes from good distribution practice will also b®
recognized.
Now, that regulation does not say that we will allow
you to overpack so that the moisture loss does not bring it
down to exact weight during distribution; it is not a
recognition of an overpack to compensate for the forthcoming
moisture loss, it’s a recognition ~~
QUESTION:

Is it clear that it would violate the

federal lew and the federal regulations for a manufacturer to

35

have a slight overweight: at the time of shipment?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

It would violate the federal law#

because —
QUESTIONs Where is that in the record# or in th©
briefs?
MR. DUNLAVEYj
QUESTIONs

You have to use the —

X'v® seen it in the argument# but I

haven't —~ I can't find it in the law anywhere,,
MR. DUNLAVEY:

It has to be a rule of reason, because

the statute says exact, except for two variations from
specified causes.

It does not say also a variation that you

deliberately put in there, which we will call the overpack.
That would be a variation —
QUESTION:

If you say something weighs a pound

and, in fact, it weighs a pound and a tenth# that's clear
that would be a violation of the federal regulations, is it?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

If you’re outside the reasonable

range, because of the manufacturing problems, yes.

If you

put a tenth of an ounce in there intentionally, that would be
a violation.
QUESTION:

Well, 1 couldn't find that explicitly

in the regulations or the law.
MR. DUNLAVEY:

If you’re looking for words that

say precisely that, I submit you will not find them# Justice
Stewart.

It has to be reasoned.

And it —

36

QUESTIONS And that,5u quit® important, because that5s
the whole basis on which the — on which your argument depends,
isn't it?
MR a DUNLAVEY;

That is important? no question about

it.
QUESTIONs

Could it b® practice in the industry?

MR. DUNLAVEY:

You can overpack ~~ of course anybody

can overpack, it's not going to save the consumer anything
because he’s going to pay for it? but when you start to overpack, you get into Pandora’s jar, because nobody knows by how
much.

We’ve gone through that in this case extensively, and

it's impossible to tell how much you should overpack to
anticipate any given amount of moisture loss.

And then the

consumer cannot make his value comparison, because he doesn’t
know how much Brand X is overpacked as contrasted with Brand Y.
So, while it’s possible, you’re getting into a
questi.on of, Does the federal law proscribe it?

And it does

not.
QUESTIONs

Well, if there were no preemption here --

MR. DUNLAVEYs
QUESTIONS

Your Honor?

If there were no preemption here, would

you have to overpack to satisfy -the California statuta?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

Thar© is no other way that I’m

aware of.
QUESTIONj

And it’s your argument that you can’t do

37

that without violating the federal statute, to overpack?
MR. DDK LAVEY:

My argument is twofold»

First of all, it’s a different requirement from the
federal law, and that's as far as you need to go for fell© Meat
Act and the Fair Packaging Act.
QUESTION*

But it need not be different •**- I mean,

it’s different only if this lav and regulations ar© necessarily
read the way you say -they must be read.

Otherwise, they are

not different.
MR. DUNLAVEYs Well, the regulation for the manufac­
turing practice, of course, has nothing to do with this
problem.
QUESTION.-

No.

MR. DUN LAVEYs
says:

The regulation for loss of moisture

We will recognize the loss of moisture that occurs,

after it occurs in the good distribution practice.
QUESTION:

Not so --•

But it doesn't use the word "after”,

it doesn’t use "thereafter'’, which is what the government says
in its brief.

?

MR. DUNLAVEYs

It sa;/s"during , good distribution

practice”.
QUESTION:

It would seem to me that if the — it

could be read that since federal standards do permit
variations from accurate weight due to water loss, they permit,
them at the time of shipment.

38

MR. DUNLAVEY:

I submit, Your Honor, it; has to b©

reasoned that when it says 'V© will recognize the loss that
occurs after the distribution process continences”
QUESTION:

Ifc doesn’t say Rafter'***

MR. DUNLAVEYs

It says "during”?

"during good

distribution practice", that tie only inference can be f.that
it does not mean w® will recognize an overpack that you put in
there in order tc compensate for the loss you know is coming.
Handbook 67, although I hate to fall back on that,
because I’m condoinning it,
QUESTIONs

Because your claim is it’s not hex’®.

MR. DUNLAVEYs

That’s right, it doesn’t belong her©

at all.
But it does say that even the States, when they
recognize the moisture loss, recognise it at some point
after distribution begins.

There has never been any real

question otherwise? argument yes, but not in practice.
QUESTION?
on time and geography?

Does the moisture loss vary depending
Would Lt be the same in California

as in South America or Alaska?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

It will vary with time, of course.

Because moisture loss is a continuing thing, and the longer it
occurs, the more it will be.

It was vary with the temperature

of the storage, because th© vapor pressure of the water is
lower at th© lower temperature, and thrfc retards the ©vapora*»

39

fciosa.
QUESTIONs

If that is so# would it be possible for

overweight to be included at the point of shipment to adjust
for

'future moisture loss?
MR. DUNLAVEY;

Not accurately.

If I put a pound and

a half of these products into a one-pound package, I can be
pretty sure that when the consumer buys it, it will have at
least a pound in it? but when I — and that’s the only way,
to over-estimate what the overpacking shall be.

But once you

do that, than you have foiled the purpose of the Fair
Packaging Act that says value comparison is our goal.
QUESTION:

Wall, wouldn’t there be another way

for the manufacturer to comply with both statutes, at least,
with respect to the flour?

Couldn't he put them in a

hermetically sealed package?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

If you have aver seen a houses with

a plaster wall, you know you can't seal the wall,* because
you get condensation on it.
There is a problem analogous to that with flour.

If

you 'put that flour in. an airtight, hermetically sealed bag-,
that moisture is going to be loose inside th© bag if the
outside of th© bag is cold and it can’t get out, it will
condense on the inside of the bag. Then your flour turns into
lumps 2 then you’ve got a problem.
QUESTION:j

What's your statutory argument on pre-

40

@mption?
MR* DUNLAVEY;

The statutory argument on preemption ,

I should go first through the Stata procedures , because the
goal, of course, is to show a difference.
To jump to Your Honor's question, the Wholesome Meat.
Act says that the States cannot impose a labeling requirement
that is different than the federal.
QUESTIONs

Where do you print that in the brief or

petition?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

Well, that would be Section 678,

Your Honor, —
QUESTIONS Well, where is it in the brief?
MR. DUNLAVEYs

By page, I — I can only turn to

the index in the brief, Your Honor? I don't know offhand.
On my respondents* brief, it would be pages 23, 26
and 54.
QUESTION;

Okay.

QUESTIONS

Also on page 8 of the government's amicus

brief, there is a quotation from it.
MR. DURLAVEYs

But the statutory language is that

there shall be no labeling requirement in addition to or
different than which is to be imposed by any State.
Now, it's clear that the federal law and the State
law in California are different.
Now, -there has been attention brought to another

41

clause in the statute that says California and other States
have concurrent jurisdiction? but that concurrent jurisdiction
is not to define what is a mislabeling or a misbranded package.
The concurrant jurisdiction is over the article itself? that5s
th® way the statute reads.

The concurrant jurisdiction is over

til® article? so that th© State can prevent its distribution if
it's misbranded? under the federal test.
QUESTIONS

Now? under — what is that?

678? isn't

it?
MR. DUNLAVEY:
QUESTIONS

Yes? Your Honor.

If — when Congress has said? if th®

State regulation is *■— what's th® language •— different —
in addition to or differant from; and if you can persuade us
that it is, I gather the statuta controls? doesn't it?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

I would certainly think so? Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

That makes — that's the end of the case.

Well? areyou going to get to that?
MR. DUNLAVEY s

Yes ? Your Honor.

QUESTION: All right.
MR. DUNLAVEYs

Justice White put me on my last page

first.
Th© Fair Packaging and Labeling Act is much like -the
Wholesome Meat Act.

It says that th© State law cannot be less

stringent than or require information different from th®

42
federal.
Now* whan you5re talking about something that(s less
stringent* that is not quit© the same as talking about some­
thing that's different from.
But we have legislative history to bring us out of
that ambiguity.

The Senate Report says that the intent of

this statute is to supersede any State net quantity labeling
requirements which differ from the federal.
So* in the Fair Packaging Act* just like the Meat
Act* we are back to the question merely of "Are they different?'1’
QUESTIONS

And how is the California standard

different from the federal standard?
MR. DUNLAVEY: All right.
California’s difference starts with the statute
itself* because the California statute says that it will not
permit the sale of packages whose average is less* at the time
of sale* than the net weight which is stated upon the package.
Now’* if you reflect upon that a minute* the differ­
ence is already becoming clear.
California says -chat th© average of the group of
packages can be overweight — and that's all right.

It can

be exact weight* and that’s all right. But it cannot be less.
And then the statute says* we will leave it to the
regulation

to dictate the ’weighing procedures to find out

whether th© statutory test is met.

43
And that brings us to Art!cl© 5.
the sampling procedure.

And Article 5 is

Its purpose is to take a limited

number of packages from a much larger over-all group, fees weigh
those packages and then to estimate what the lot average must
be.
Now, as soon as you start to estimate what the larger
number of packages weighs by resorting to only a few of them,
you're into the area of probability»

And Article 5 is nothing

but the statistician’s procedure for determining whether' ths
lot, the whole number of packages, has an average weight less
than labeled weight.
Now, the first thing that the article brings to mind
is that you're already talking about a lot or a group of
packages which is different from what the federal government
was testing at the plant.
If you have 100 packages whose average is X, and
you take any tan of them, the chances are that the average of
the ten is not going to b© exactly X.

And that's fch@ first

problem with the State procedure, because they are only
investigating a portion of the over-all lot that the federal
estimated.
The second difference is that the federal — that fcha
State sayb, We are going to charge against the manufacturer
all of the product weight that sticks to the wrapper.

That's

like tailing the manufacturer of catchup that if I can't; get

44
your catchup out of the bottle# I'm not going to give you
credit for having put it in.
That's the wet tear# the wet wrapper philosophy of
the State versus the dry wrapper or the dry tear philosophy of
the federal.

The federal government says We'll give you

credit for all that put in.

The

State government says# No#

ws'll only give you credit for what our inspector can tek© out.
Now# in trying to ascertain the average of the lot
from a limited number of samples# the regulation first has
to decide whether there are any of those samples that are
aberrations on the over-all picture.

That is# is there an

unreasonable error in any of those packages?
So it says# the States regulation says that the
permissible plus or minus variation of each of these packages
in the sample is limited in this fashions

First of all# you

have to find out how many packages there are in this lot.
And the regulation is blind as to what they are packages of#
it doesn't distinguish between bacon and flour or anything
else? it simply says# Tell me first how many packages are in
the lot.

And from that# I will tell you what fco put in your

sub-group# mnd from that 1 will help you find out those
packages which cannot b© count*5d in your averaging procedure.
The second tiling is to determine the range of the
samples# which means# what's the difference between the heaviest
package in the sample

and the lightest package?

45
That range, no matter what's caused it, becomes
another factor in deciding whether a package in ’the sample
can be counted,
Th® next thing is:
•these sample packages?

What's the total variation in

If three of them are overweight and

two of them are underweight, what’s the net balance?

And

that., whatever caused it, is also a factor in determining the
unreasonable variation of th© individual package,
QUESTION:

Mr, Dunlavey, are you asking us to throw

out any kind of a statistical procedure here at all?
MR, DUNLAVEY:
not.

ho, Your Honor, I most certainly am

There has been a confusion in the briefs between

statistical sampling and averaging.

Averaging for one purpose

or another.
A statistical sampling, in the proper sense of the
word, simply means:

Give me a few packages and I will find out

for you th© characteristic, whatever you want to make that
characteristic, of the larger number.
If th® goal of the statistical sampling were right,
there would be no objection to it.

The problem with Article 5

is it has the wrong goal.
QUESTION:

The real incompatibility, as I understand

it, the basic incompatibility, as I understand it — and tell
me if I misunderstand it

is that the State regulation

requires a certain rate at the time of sale, and the federal

46

law and regulation requires certain weight at the time of
shipment.

Is that it?
MR. DUNLAVEYs And of course distribution takes place

after shipment.
questions

After shipment.

MR. DUNLAVEY:
QUESTION:

So that has to be allowed for* also.

Well, isn’t that it?

MR. DUNLAVEY:

That's correct. Your Honor.

And what the difference is becomes, at

least relatively, irrelevant, even though we need to have it.
v
demonstrated to us.
MR. DUNLAVEY:

That’s exactly right as to the Whole­

some Meat Act and the Fair Packaging Act, because they sayjust to be different is enough for preemption.

There is a

47
little bit: more to the Food and Drug Act;., but basically it's
the same problem.

In fact# the difference rises to the

dignity of an irreconcilable conflict# and of course that's
why that Food and Drug Act preempts also.
Let me make one thing clear# if l may# Mr* Justice
Stewart.

'The evidence and the record in this case are

unequivocal on two points.

California law does not allow any

deviation whatsoever because of good manufacturing practice.
It simply doesn't.
California law also does not allow any deviation for
loss or gain of moisture during good distribution practice.
QUESTION:

Well# it measures it at tha time of

sal©# it doesn't, say anything about distribution practices.
California measures the weight at the time of sal®.
that correct?

Isn’t

After the dis tributi on has taken, place.

MR. DUNLAVEY:

That is absolutely correct. And the

inspectors hav© told us# just as you can ascertain from reading
the statutes slid regulations on their face# "We male® no
allowance for unavoidable deviations for either of the two
causes prescribed by tha federal law.

In no way do we make

allowone® for those two reasons."
QUESTION2

And I tsk© it that’s where you say it

differs from the federal standard# —
MR. DUNLAVEY%
QUESTIONs

Yes# Chief —

~~ on© of the points of difference,

48

MR.. DUNLAVEY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is a

very substantial difference-, and that should be enough to carry
th© day.

It’s frosting on the cake to say that that difference

rises to fch© point whore you can’t comply with federal
State lav; at the same time.

and

And that's the worst kind of

difference, and that is good for preemption, even for &
statute like the Pood and Drug Act, that is not an express
preemptory —
QUESTION;

That’s on the basis that you put too

much in at th© beginning.

In order to be sure you have enough

at the sal® placa.
MR. DUNLAVEY;

That’s exactly right, Justice Marshall.

QUESTION; And by doing that, you violate th© federal
law, by putting too much in.
MR. DUNLAVEY:
right.

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, that’s

Andyou can see that that is an evil that can lead to

a lot of complications, because if people are overpacking to
meet the requirement in California, each on© has to decide for
himself how much he’s going to overpack., the customer will
never knew» the customer then cannot make sin intelligent pric©
comparison, because he doesn’t know what the food value is
in the- package whan, he buys it.
QUESTION:

He knows it is at least the weight or

quantity that is marked?
MR. DUNLAVEY;

Yes, but he won't know whether 79 cents

49
for a pound and an ounce is a good buy., as compared with 81
cents for a pound .and two ounces, because, as far as he knows ,
each package has only got a pound in it.

So he's deprived of

the chance to male® his decision»
QUBSTIONs

I know it’s in the statute, and I

appreciate your argument, but if I was buying a pound of
bacon and X got- a pound and a quarter for th® same price, I
don't think I!d quarrel»
MR» DUNLAVEY:

Mr. Justice Marshall, you know you're

not going to get a pound and a quarter of bacon for the price
of a pound.
If you get a pound and a quarter in your package,
the price you pay is going to reflect it.

There is nothing —

there is no "something for nothing" in this lawsuit.
QUESTION 2

Mr. Dunlavay, does the record tell us

whether any representative of ''she federal government has ever
asserted an overpacking — that overpacking is a violation?
Have you ever been criticized for overpacking, or any packer,
or anybody subject to this statute?

MR. DUNLAVEYi The record in this case would be
silent on that, I believe, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

And the Solicitor

General, or nobody

representing the United States, has ever been asked his views

on

this issue, which is critical to your whole argument.

isn't it?

50

MR» DUNLAVEY:

Oh, the Solicitor General has made

it very clear that you cannot overpack»

That is a violation

of th@ federal law»
QUESTION;

That is?

MR. DUN LAVEY g

And the Pood and Drug Administration,

has said in •—
QUESTION;

1 understand.

MR. DUN LAVEY:

~ a brief to the Ninth Circuit that

"We* re not going to require these manufacturers to overpack,
because that’s not the policy that oxir agency is enforcing.”
QUESTION*

Not require it, but not permit them --

the word would be "permit" rather than wrequire"»
It would seam to me, I don't know, but just from
everything you've said, if you did add another sixteenth of
an ounce or so, maybe you'd have enough in there so you comply
with both statutes.

I'm just •— is it perfectly clear you

couldn't do both?
MR. DUNLAVEY;

It is perfectly clear that if you

put extra bacon or flour into your package, not because of
the manufacturing problem, not because of a distribution
moisture loss problem, but simply because you’re going to
overpack intentionally to allow for something that you know
is coming, that is a variation that is not permitted by
federal statute or federal regulation.
QUESTION*

Now, where, in these papers that we have,

51
is that perfectly clear?
Because that’s a necessary link, in your argument.
MR. DUNLAVEY;

If I have done my job — and I hope

1 have —- respondents* brief is very clear on that point, Your
honor.

That you cannot serve both masters.
QUESTIONS Well, what is it?

Is it a regulation?

Is it aii interpretation of the statute?
of the statute?

Is it the language

What precisely is it that supplies that link?

MR. DUNLAVEY:

It com.es from this chronology, or

sequence, —*
QUESTIONS

I mean, is it just &.n argument on your

part?
MR, DUNLAVEYs

Yes, I suppose it could be categorized

as that, Mr. Justice Rahnquistj but it's more than an argument*
really, because the statute says, first of all, it will be
accurate weight.

No exemptions.

No deviations, for any

reason.
Then the regulation comes along and says, "No, it
can deviate from accuracy for one of two causes? but overpacking is not one of those two causes."

Therefore, it must

be contrary.
QUESTION:

Mr, Dunlavey, I don't quite understand

why — since the preemption section says that the federal
»

controls if it’s different from — if the 'State is different
from the federal.

Why isn't, at least as to bacon, it enough

52

to. affirm, that the federal statute focuses on the time of
packaging, and the Sfcafea at the time of sal©?

Why isn’t

that the end ©f the case, as to bacon?
MR. DUNLAVEY s

l really have no answer to that.

That is the and of the case.
QUESTION: Then what's the relevance of all this
overpacking «QUESTION:

Even if you could comply with both

of thorn, the preemption section controls the case, in your
view, I take it?
MR. DUNLAVEY: The two statutes that 3ay that pre­
emption shall occur as to any tiling that's different, yes.
Then, as to those statutes, which are Meat and Fair Packaging,
it makes no difference whether you could comply with both.
You don’t have to.
The federal law —
QUESTION:

Although the packaging is an irrelevancy,

at least as to meat, isn’t it?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

Gverpacking is an unacceptable or *—

QUESTION: Well, acceptable or not, for purposes of
deciding whether or not the federal statute preempts, if the
federal statute speaks to tee 1dm© of packaging and the State
statute the time of sal®, why isn't that the end of it under
the preemption clause?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

I would agree with Your Honor, that —•

53

QUESTION3

On bacon.

MR. DUNLAVEYi

—■ if you can interpret the law that

meticulously, that is sufficient. They are different.
law says they shall not h© different.

The

That's the end of the

case.
QUESTION: Well, they're different, but they are not
necessarily inconsistent.

If hh® State law required that the

packaging be cf a certain color, and the federal law didn't
a ay anything about color, would that be?
MR. DUNLAVEY: -That- wouldn't be this case.

If the

federal law doesn't tell you, in a given area, that you
neither have to do something, nor. must not do something
QUESTION:
about what

And til® federal law doesn't say anything

it has to be at the point of sale.

And the

State law doesn't say anything about what it has to be at
the time of packaging.

So where — how are they different?

MR. DUNLAVEY: Well, Your Honor, may I suggest that
the federal law does say what it has to be at the time of
shipping as well as at the trims of sale.
QUESTION; The federal law says what it has to be
at the time of shipping.
MR. DUNLAVEY; And what it has to be at the time of
sale, because what it has to bo at -the time of sale is s.
combination of what it was when it was shipped, plus what's
happened to it in the meantime.

54
QUESTION: Well, it's. a product of

it’s a

consequence of what it was at the time of shipping. And the
federal lew, you told us, I thought, applies only to the time
of shipping.
MR. DUNLAVEY:

That’s not litorally right.

The

federal lew says that when the product is shipped, its label
has to be accurate, subject to only on© of these two deviations.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. DUNLAVEY;
QUESTION:

The manufacturing of the product —-

MR. DUNLAVEY:
of the federal law.

That’s the manufacturing.

That’s the shipping time requirement

And the federal law says you have to

expand that into fch© moisture loss that comes afterward.
QUESTION:

In the distribution process.

In the

course of it.
MR. DUNLAVEY: That becomes a distribution problem.
So they are cumulative by the ‘.time they reach the consumer.
QUESTION: But it doesn't hav© an. impact directly at
«

all at the time of sale, does it, fch© federal law or regulation?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

Only that to© distribution lastsup

until the time of sal©.
QUESTION:

But if the Stato directs itself both©

time of sale, that’s an additional requirement, isn’t, it?
MR. DUNLAVEY:
additional

Yes, of course, Your Honor, an

55
QUESTIONS

It's an additional over and above, or

even if it’s no snore rigid, even if it were no more rigid,
it’s an additional requirement.
QUESTIONs

If something is additional, is it

necessarily different?
MR. DUNLAVSYs
QUESTION:

That's the question.
These two are different ~
It's additional or different in the

standard
MR. DUNLAVEYi

In the Meat Act, additional or

different? that's correct.
But, if I may, Mr. Justice Stewart, when you talk
about th© course of good distribution practice, you are talking
about things that happen up until the day the customer pulls
it out of the cooler and buys it.
And so, any federal requirement that extends up to
that point, really, is extending up to th© point of sale.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:41 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above~entitled matter was submitted.]
