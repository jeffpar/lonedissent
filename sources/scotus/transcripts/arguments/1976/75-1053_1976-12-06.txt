MR. CHIEF justice BURGER;

We will hear arguments next

in 75>” 1053, Jones against Rath.
Mr. Keir, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOYAL E. KEIR, ESQ.,
jON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KEIR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Before I begin my discussion of petitioner’s
contentions, I would like to invite the Court's attention to
an error that appears in Petitioner's Reply Brief, and I
invite the Court's attention particularly to page 8 of the
Reply Brief, where we have quoi^ed a portion of Handbook 67.
I’m looking down towards the bottom of the page, which starts
with the words "It is admitted that such indefinites" and so
/

forth.
Actually that quotation ends in the middle of a
sentence.

And we think this was a publisher's or printing

error, and the full quotation actually appears in the Appendix
to the amicus curiae brief of 33 States that was filed in
support of the petition.
I'm referring to the amicus curiae brief, that is,
the first, one filed by the several States? there was a later one
filed concurrently with the petitioner’s opening brief.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Keir # why don't you do this by

letter?
MR. KEIRs

Beg your pardon# sir?

QUESTION; Why don't you tell tills information by
letter? 1
MR. KEIRs

I was going to suggest# Your Honor# that

I would write a letter to the clerk and set forth the complete
quotation# so that we can correct -the record.

If that is

okay?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
MR. KEIRs

Very well.

This is a case which comes to the Court

on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
It involves the enforcement of a California statuta
and California regulations pertaining to the weights .and
measures of packaged commodities.
Actually# we have two separate but related cases
hare# namely# the Rath Packing Company case# which involves
packaged bacon# and -the General Mills case# which involves
packaged wheat flour.
Although there were a number of issues that were
decided by the lower courts# the principal holding of both the
United States District Court and the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit is that the California statute and its inter-

5
pretafcive regulation ar© preempted by federal law.

More

specifically, the Federal Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 in the
Rath Packing Company case, and the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, and the Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act
in the General Mills case.
The issue of preemption is the only issue that
petitioner has raised in the petition to this Court.
In discussing the inspection process that is followed
by petitioner and other enforcement officers in California,
I should first define a term that will be used during the
course of the oral argument.

This is the term ’’lot".

A lot

may be defined as a group of apparently identical packages
found at the same placa and at the same time.
For example, 500 packages of wheat flour found in a
— on the shelves of a Safeway Store on a certain date., each
package stating that it contains ten pounds net weight.
Nov/, this is a "lot".
The inspection process that, is followed by the
inspection officers in California does not involve inspection
of each package in a lot.

Obviously, that would be too

expensive and too time-consuming.
Instead, under the California system, and Article 5
is how we ordinarily refer to the California regulation,
provides for lot averaging.
sampling.

And this is done -through random

For example, in the example that I gave of a lot of

6

500 packages, the inspection officer would select 25 samples,
and he would take then from various parts of this lot, so that
he would get a group of representative samples of the lot.
These are taken at random. These packages are weighed
and the net weight of fch© average is determined.

If that net

weight is equal to or more than the labeled weight, then the
entire lot is approved.

If the lot average net weight is lass

than the labeled weight, then th© entire lot is ordered off
sale.
Now, this system that's followed in California is a
statistically valid, system, and it has so been held by the
United States District Court.
One of the basic defenses that has been raised by
the respondents is that the California system does not provide
for reasonable variations.

That is, variations caused by

discrepancies in manufacturing processes, or gain or loss of
moisture during the course of good distribution practices.
However, we wish to respond to this argument, and
that is that th© California system does provido for reasonable
variations, and that these variations are taken into account
through the lot-*averaging system.

In other words, variations

are inherent, by -fch® very use of the lot averaging system.
Although there is no specific mention in the
California regulation as to variations caused by loss or gain
of moisture, variations under the State system can be fcr any

7
reason or for all reasons0
W® must ©raphesize that contrary to what the
respondents would have the Court believe, reasonable variati.mis
do not mean shortages below the lot average.,

This warning was

clearly set out in Handbook 67 published by the National
Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce. And Handbook
67 states that this is the basic requirement of the National
Conference of weights end Measures, and of the Food and Drug
Adminis traticn.
We would submit to this Court that the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mad© three basic errors.
To the extent that time permits, I will discuss on®
of fcha errors, and Mr. Goodman will discuss the other two»
Th© first one, the first error is the determination
by the Court with regard to the time when accuracy of weights
and measures is to be determined.
The second error is in the Court’s interpretation of
the concurrent jurisdiction provisions in Section 408 of th©
Wholesome Meat Act, which may be found in Title 21, Section
678.
And thirdly, the error by the Court in its inter­
pretation of th© provisions of the Fair Packaging and Labe liner
Act in so far as it related to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

Act.

In this connection I refer specifically to Title 15,

Section 1461.

3
QUESTION t

Each of those errors , Mr. Keir, I take it,

is in the context of saying the Ninth Circuit was wrong in
saying there was preemption?
MR. KEIR:

That is correct, "/our Honor.

All thro® of these errors deal strictly with th©
issue of preemption.
I go now to the first error, which we assart was
committed by the Ninth Circuit, and that is in its determina­
tion as to the time when accuracy of weights and measures
is to ba determined.

And that is, according to the Ninth

Circuit, it’s th© time of packaging of the product.
Th© Solicitor General, in his amicus curia© brief
filed with this Court, agrees with the Ninth Circuit, that the
time of packaging is th© key time.
Interestingly enough, however, the respondents,
contrary to the Ninth Circuit end the Solicitor General,
maintain that the proper time for determining accuracy is the
time of shipment.
Petitioner contends that the State standard is fcha
time of sal® to the consumer, that this is the only correct
standard, and it is the only standard that can be correctly
identified with th© interests of the consumer.
Surely, we would be hard-pressed to find even one
consumer who, when he picks up a food package in a supermarket,
and looks at fee label, would think to himself that this label

9

speaks as of the dat© of packaging or as the date of shipment
from some distant shipping point.
The natural tiling for a consumer to think to himself ,
when he examines the package and looks at the label , is that
"the label speaks to me now".
QUESTIONS

Mr. Keir, con I just be sure I under­

stand your argument in this very point.

You say the proper

view is that the State requirement speaks of the time of sal©
to the consumer?
MR. KEIR;
QUESTION;

That's correct,. Your Honor.
And that the Court of Appeals for the

Ninth Circuit and the Solicitor General erroneously said that
th® time* tha critical time was the time of packaging?
MR. KEIR;

That is correct.

QUESTION;

Now, war© they talking about the critical

time within the meaning of tha federal statute or within the
meaning of tha State statute?
MR. KEIR;

Well, they were referring to the federal

tion of tim federal standard?
MR. KEIR:

I plan to com© to that, Your Honor.

Our

position is -that the tiro© of sal© is not only th© State
standard but is also th® federal standard.
what I propose to urge upon this Court.

This is part of

10

QUESTION*

That they have, in effect, enforced their

own law incorrectly is what you’re saying.
I’m having trouble, because it seems to me that you
may be arguing your opponent’s case, if you’re saying th©
State standard is A, the federal standard is B, therefore they
are different? then, v?ithin the meaning of th© statute, it
seems to me you lose, because the statute says you cannot have
different standards.
MR» KEXR;

Well, I propose to —*

QUESTION:

I just want to ba sure I understand how

your argument fits together.
MR. KEIR:

I propose to urge upon the Court, Your

Honor, that the standard which we submit here, namely, th®
standard of accuracy at time of sale, is not only th© State
standard but is also the fadaral standard.

And that both

the Ninth Circuit and the Solicitor General are in error in
their conclusion that the time of packaging is the federal
standard.
QUESTION:

Then you’re saying the federal statute

requiras the Department of Agricultura to use th® time of
packaging as the only permissible time for determining all
this?
MR. KEIR:

Well, —

QUESTION:
only permissible time

Required to use th® time of sale as the

11
MR. KEIR;

The Ninth Circuit determined that the

time of packaging is th© correct time* not because th© federal
statute stated that,* but because this was the conclusion of th©
Ninth Circuit.
And the Solicitor General agreed with it.
As I stated* the respondents* on the other hand*
disagree with both the Ninth Circuit and the Solicitor General,,
and they claim that th© correct time is the time of shipment.
QUESTION:

Whan you say th© correct time* how do

you measure correctness* by federal law* by State law* or
by what’s a better way to do the job?

I’m not quite ~~ that’s

what I'm having trouble understanding.
MR. KEIR:

Petitioner is trying to urge upon this

Court what is the proper time for determining accuracy of
weights and measures* and* as we develop our argument* we
intend to present to the Court th© proposition that this
principia of having accuracy of weights and measures at the
time of sal© to the consumer is a standard which is both a
State standard as well as a federal standard.
QUESTION:
MR. KEIR;

Ons required by federal statute?
Yes.

QUESTION; Well* I don't like to beat a dead horse*
but the question in this case isn’t which time is the proper
time, from the point of view of which is the best policy et
which

which time does the best policy require that it be

12

measured,, but-, rather* what doss the federal standard require
and what does the State standard require.
That's the questions* isn’t it?
MR. KEIR:

That is right, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Arid if they are different* then there is

federal preemption.

That is* they are different and

incompatible* then there is federal preemption.

Regardless of

the wisdom of it.
MR. KEIR: Well* Your Honor*
QUESTION s

Isn’t that correct?

MR. KEIR;

That is correct.

QUESTION;

And if they are not different *•-

MR. KEIR:

I see that my time is up.

and I are sharing our time.
I will now yield to Mr, Goodman.

Mr. Goodman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J; GOODMAN* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL.* AS
AMICI CURIAE
MR. GOODMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
Let me begin by responding to Mr. Justice Stevens'
question* and Mr. Justice Stewart’s question* about the time
of accuracy.
It is* in fact, as the Court will see from Mr. Keir’s

13
brief —*■ I think he's just a little flustered in. oral argument
•— that petitioner's contention as is amici3s contention, on
whose behalf I rise today, is that the federal standard is
true weight at retail.
The ninth Circuit's reasoning is that -QUESTION?

That means true weight at sale?

MR. GOODMAN;

That's correct, Your Honor, true

weight to the business purchaser, true weight to the
individual purchaser, because that is the only "way in which
a businessman, for example, -QUESTION;

If the federal statute is to b© read

"true weight at packaging time'3, that's the end of this case,
isn't it?
MR. GOODMAN:

Well, YourHonor, we don't think that

it is.
QUESTIONS

I see.

MR. GOODMANs

And I will com© to that point in a

minute, if Your Honor pleas®.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goodman, if you crank it up a little

higher, you'll get the mike -— no, see inside there?

The

other way.
MR. GOODMAN?

Very good.

Thank you, Your Honor.

The federal *— the Ninth Circuit decision holds
that the standard is trua weight at the time of shipment from
the packaging plant, but that — - and that reasonable variations

14
©re allowed thereafter»
Our principal contention on this point is that the
phrase "reasonable variations" has been misconstrued by the
Ninth Circuit.
For example, we know, and the Court will of course
recall its own decisions, which say that -the purpose of the
three federal statutes in issue here

the Food, Drug, and.

Cosmetic Act, th® Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and the
Wholesome Meat Act — are all,in the language of the Fair
Packaging and Labeling Act,

to provide consumers with accurate

information as to the quantity of contents and other statements
on the package label.
Secondly, there is a decision of the Second Circuit,
United Statos vs. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, 92 Fed
2d 610, in which a State inspector found prints of butter,
one-pound packages of butter, to b© — to contain less product
than stated on the label at 'the retail store.

In affirming

th® district court’s conviction of the Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Company for misbranding, the Second Circuit said, and I quotes
"There can be no dispute that -the under-weight prints of butter
were misbranded, specifically focusing upon the reasonable
variations language in the statute."
Let us consider the analogous statute, the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.

That Act provides,

as do two of the three Acts here in question, that the Food,

15
Drug * and Cosmetic Act and th© Wholesome Meat Act# that the
Secretary shall require true weight# provided that reasonable
variations may be permitted.
Pursuant to that statutory command# first

the

Secretary of Agriculture# and latar the Environmental Protection
Administration# both r€>qui,re that som© packages may be over and
under# so long as at retail th© packages six& full weight.
Thus, in that case# as th© Court may recall from
looking at th© briefs# th© standard under the Insecticide Act
is true weight per package poisonous.

There should b® no

reason why the statutes in issue in this caso# ’which us© the
same language# should permit short-weight in food products.
Let me turn now to the questions of preemption.
Thus — the first step is, is there a conflict between the
statutes?
We have to deal with the three statutes in terms of
historical perspective.

The first is the Food# Drug# end

Cosmetic Act# which# as the Court# I am sure# recognizes#
does not have any preemptive language.

So th© question is#

in this Court,# for ©scampi© # in Campbell vs. Hussey# does this
statuta impermissibly conflict# does the California law
impermissibly conflict with the federal?
It's our position that it doesn’t# because# as I have
just discussed# the federal law requires true weight at retail.
Moreover# even if there is a conflict# prior

16

decisions of this Court, ©specially th© decision last term
in Great Atlantic

&.

Pacific Tea Company vs. Cottrell,

specifically permit the States to have more stringent standards,
provided those standards ar© not discriminatory.
QUESTIONs

But is that the language that's important

or controlling in this case?

Or is it the language dealing

with requiring .information different from, as between the
federal and State standards?
MR, GOODMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, I think Youx* Honor

is referring now to Section 403 of the Wholesome Meat Act.
Let me proceed directly to that point, and discuss both that
point and 1461 of 15 U.S.C, , which is the Fair Packaging and
Labeling Act standard.
The language in Section 678 of 21 U.S.c,, or Section
408 of the Wholesome Meat Act, only prescribes that States
may not have marking, labeling, packaging or ingredient
requirements which are in addition to or

different than the

federal law.
However, in the same sentence, later in the same
clause, it gives the States concurrent jurisdiction to enforce
adulteration and misbranding requirements and the standard to
be met is so long as the State requirements for adulteration,
misbranding are consistent with the requirements under fch©
Wholesome Meat Act.
And thus, the only standard which the State must

17

follow# which fch© States must follow under the

Wholesome Meat,

Actt is tli© same as under the Food# Drug# and Cosmetic Act.
What Congress said# marking, packaging, labeling and
ingredients are preempted, but misbresiding is not.
Nov/, contrary to respondents* assertion and contrary
to the assertion, for example, in -the amicus brief filed by
the National Independent Meat Packers Association, there is a
distinction between labeling and misbranding.
What NIMPA argues in its amicus brief is that the
term '’labeling15 has swallowed ap the term "misbranding*5, and
this is almost a direct quote, "labeling includes misbranding".
But, if that is fch© case, then how do respondents
and respondents* amici solve tie problem of misbranding,
including definitions of things other than labeling?
For example, 601(n)(5) in 21 — 601(n) of 21 U.S.C.
also say3 that a package is misbranded if it's deceptively
filled. That is clearly not a l the ling requirement.
So there is a distinction, between labeling and
branding, something that w© discuss in further detail in our
brief. And teat same distinction applies to 15 U.S.C., Section
1461, under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.
Finally, let me respond to a question which was
asked before, Is preemption the only grounds upon which w©
urge reversal?
Tli© answer to that is no.

18
Assuming that the federal lew does not require
accuracy at time of retail sals, and assuming that -this Court
would otherwise *— or thereby hold that there is an impermis­
sible conflict between the State and federal laws, it is
amici's contention that this Court's decision last June, after
w© filed our amicus brief,in National League of Cities vs.
Usery, still compels reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.
The Ninth Circuit's reasoning is that the States may
not exercise our sovereign police power to protect our
business and consumer purchasers against deception in the sal©
of food products.
QUESTION:

Is this a constitutional argument?

MR. GOODMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

The National League of Cities decision

might be very relevant and even persuasive here, if it were
the State that wera in the business of producing and selling
the bacon or the flour? but it isn't.
MR. GOODMAN:

Mr. Justice Stewart, what Section 678

of the Wholesome Meat Act says is marking, labeling and
packaging, ingredients may not-be imposed by any State. The
State is in the business of assuring tru© weight at retail,
has always been, that is a historic police power recognised
by this Court ~~
QUESTION:

Well, if on© should accept that argument,

one could just forget the preemptive effect of federal law,

19

couldn’t they?
MR, GOODMANS
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, —

Isn’t that right?

MR. GOODMANs

~~ it doesn't necessarily follow.

This case is even easier than Usery, because, in tills case,
the activity engaged in by the State is the activity of a
sovereign power, this is a power which, in Turner~vs, Mary1and,
this Court recognised —•
QUESTIONt

It’s a sovereign power imposing regula­

tions on private individuals, not acting for itself, isn't it?
W@ didn't say in National League of Cities that the
federal law governing wages couldn’t preempt State law
governing wages, where you're talking about applying it to
private concerns.

And isn't that what you have here?

MR. GOODMAN:

No, Mr, Justice Kehnquisfc, I don’t

think so.
The activity of the State here is an activity that
can ba engaged in only by a State.
QUESTIONS
MR. GOODMANS
QUESTIONS

Well, regulating people.
Yes, Your Honor.
By a State or, in our society, by the

State government or by the local government or by the federal
government or by whatever3 but it's pretty well accepted that
if there's incompatibility# than the federal regulation pre­
empts the others

20

MR. GOODMAN:
QUESTIONS

Let me return to —
Is that correct?

MR. GOODMAN:

In response to Your Honor’s question,

let ma return, then, to Greet Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company
vs, Cottrell, in which the Court again held that the State
of Mississippi could enforce its own more stringent laws with
respect to th© adulteration of milk products,

tod let’s

discuss the respondents’ argument in this case in light of
that decision.
W© know that in the ?ood. Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
and in the Wholesome Meat Act, the terms 11 adulteration" and
"misbranding” are statutorily linked; thus, in Section 408 of
the Wholesome Meat Act, it says the States may enforce
adulteration or misbranding requirements, so long as they are
consistent with.
The respondents’ contention is that they cannot be
held accountable for the standard of the product, the quality
of the product, the contents of the product at the time it
leaves the shipping dock,
What that means is that applies not only to the net
weight, which is the question presented in this case, but to
bacteriological standards as well? and thus, if they cannot
be required to have true weight at retail, then can they be
required to have wholesomaness at retail?
answer to that question iss

We submit the

All throe federal statutes —

21

excuse me, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and th© Wholesome
Meat Act require wholesomeness at retail,, as well.

And th©

issue in -this case turns on the question of whether we're
going to revert to

&

standard of wholesomeness when packed,

as opposed -bo wholesomeness at retail.
Thus, under the language of A5P v. Cottrell, the
Stato has a concern, an interest, a need to require true weight
and wholesomeness at retail and, moreover, so does the federal
government.

And that's why the three federal statutes must

b® interpreted as requiring true weight at retail.
QUESTIONs

There was no preemption question involved

in the ASP case, was there?
MR. GOODMAN*
QUESTION:

That, Mr. Justice, is —
It was just the commerce clause, was it

not?
MR. GOODMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor, and I

appreciate the Court pointing that out- because, in this case,
there is no commerce clause question, because the respondents
have not cross-petitioned.
But -the language of this Court in Cottrell, we
believe, doss stand for th© proposition that the re is an
inherent interest on the part of the States in

requiring true

weight at retail.
Let me, in closing, make one other point, and that
is that, as in the Solicitor General's brief, they refer to

22

the proposed revision of Handbook 67 and have lodged that with
fch® Court.
On© of the statements in Handbook 67* one of the
conclusions of the author that were by the National Bureau of
Standards* is that the present packaging practice is for
packagers to overfill between 70 to SO percent of their
product.

That appears in the Handbook* which has been lodged*

on either pag© 8 or page 12.
The present packaging practice of industry is to
©verpack.
In conclusion,, we contend that* for each of the
reasons set forth in our brief and as discussed today with
certain brevity* that the Ninth Circuit decision ought to be
reversed.
What respondente seek is a rule that short-weight —
by their interpretation of the reasonable variations provision
—- that short-weight packages must

remain on sale* and that

overweight packages must be removed from sale.

And thus* toe

Ninth Circuit held teat one of th© reasons why the Stats law
was less stringent than the federal law was because we did not
require enforcement action against overweight packages.
And it's our contention* as sat forth more fully in
our brief* that that simply doesn't make good enforcement
sans©* it is very expensive to th© packer* and it doesn't do
anyone any good.

23
Thank you.
QUESTIONi

General, could I

- has the State

abandoned the -«* any arguments about Younger v. Harris?
MR, GOODMAN;

No, Your Honor.

The problem, if I may

say so, in this case is -that the Court granted the petition
for certiorari in No. 1053, but did not *— is still holding
the petition in No. 1052.
QUESTION;

I sea.

MR. GOODMAN;
Your Honor.

So you haven’t abandoned it?

We have not abandoned those arguments,

I am, of cours©, the principal author of that

brief, and the Court has simply not acted upon that petition.
QUESTION;

And I suppose that if there are really

jurisdictional questions, we necessarily must reach them?
MR. GOODMAN:

I’m sorry, I didn't hear the end of

that.
QUESTION;

If there are jurisdictional questions, we

necessarily must reach them, 1 suppose?
MR. GOODMAN;

Wall, it’s an interesting procedural

posture in this, case, Your Honor.
There were, in fact, two complaints filed in the
district court.

The Rath vs» issckor action, upon which 1052

is based, proceeded through trial, after objections were mad®
and after a writ was taken on -she Ninth Circuit, and a writ
danied on the jurisdictional question.

And this action,

although filed, was not served until after the trial in Backer.

24

So that it would be possible, X suppose, for the
Court to decide this ~~
QUESTION s

Well, the jurisdictional issue certainly

survives, no matter what.
QUESTION?

And isn't it lurking in this case?

MR. GOODMANs Well, Your Honor, that’s not the only
issue lurking in this case.

In fact, we have some evidentiary

problems which are set out —
