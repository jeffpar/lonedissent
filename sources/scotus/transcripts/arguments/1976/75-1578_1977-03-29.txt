MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning .in 75“ 1578, Wainwrighfc against Sykes»
Mr. Corces»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES CORCES, JR, , ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CORCES:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleas© this

honorable Court:
My name is Charley Corces, Jr., appearing in behalf
of the petitioner V7ainwright in this cause.
This cases involves the recurring problem of the
procedural default and its effect, its effect on subsequent
habeas corpus proceedings in federal court.
The court granted certiorari on two cases, on two
points:

One, whether the failure to challenge the admissibil­

ity of an out-of-court statement at or before trial should
preclude habeas relief of a habeas petitioner’s voluntariness
claim at subsequent habeas proceedings»
And, two, whether or not Jackson vs. Dor.no mandates
a voluntariness hearing where the admissibility of a confession
is not challenged,
Mr, Sykes was charged in Florida with second™degree
murder.

Hr proceeded to trial, and. during the course of his

trial certain inculpatory statements were introduced in
evidence against him

4
Florida has a procedural rule? specifically Rule
3*190 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure^ which require
that a pretrial motion to suppress any confessions which it has
claimed or alleged were illegally obtained be made, or at:
least that an objection be made at trial*
But in this case counsel for Sykes neither filed his
pretrial motion nor objected to the admissibility of any of
the statements during the course of the trial*
Mr. Sykes was convicted of murder in the third degree,
a lesser offense.

He appealed his conviction.

But in his

«appeal he did not raise the issue of the voluntariness of these
admissions.

The only issues he raised on appeal were the

sufficiency of the evidence, sndfwo other questions pertaining

to instructions as to second-degree murder and instructions
as to self-de fense.
The appeal was affirmed.
The first time that Mr. Sykes raised the issue
pertaining to the voluntariness of his admissions or
inculpatory statements was in post-convicti on proceedings?
filed in post-conviction proceedings in tine trial court,
in the nature of habeas corpus.
But, in Florida, a matter that was known to a criminal
defendant and which should have and could have been raised at
tii© trial level, and on direct appeal, cannot be raised
collaterally.

So, naturally, this was denied.

5
QUESTIONS

Is ha raising an issue of ineffective

assistance of counsel?
MR» GORGES s

No# sir.

And*, in fact, in the habeas

hearing in the district federal court, he executed a written
waiver of any contention that his State ferial or appellate
counsel was incompetent»
incompetency.

So here we have no question of

Competency of State trial and appellate counsel

has been conceded.
QUESTION? What if he had attempted to raise the issue
on appeal# not having raised it at trial?
MR. CORCES;

I think 'that the Florida appellate

court, would have denied the point.
QUESTION2

The rule in Florida is you must raise

your evidentiary objections?
MR. GORGES;
QUESTION;

That is correct.
Is that subject to a plain-error exception?

In Florida.
MR. GORGES;

I think just about anything is subject

to a plain error# where it is clear in the record# Your Honor#
that -there may b© -- for instance# you may have a completely
coerced confession# that the testimony comes out that he was
beaten# out of the defendant# and in all probably it would
be plain error, yes# sir.
QUESTION;

W® don't have that situation here.

Well# is the claim that the — does his

claim in collateral proceedings require flushing out with a

6

hearing?

And did it rest on facts outside the record that

had already been made?
MRo GORGES %

No» sir.

The proceedings in State

court, were flushed out on the pleadings.
QUESTION? So that all the facts are in the record?
MR. CORCES:

All the facts that we have* yes* sir.

QUESTION? With respect to voluntariness?
MR. GORGES:

No* sir.

His claim of voluntariness is*

— the officers gave him his Miranda rights.

His claim is that

he was intoxicated and did not understand them.

And of course

Florida was never put on notice that -~
QUESTION; So that his claim doesn’t depend on any
more facts than are in the record?
MR. CORCES:

Yes* sir. Because the State was never

able fee focus on the issue of voluntariness on whether or not
ha understoodhis Miranda rights.
QUESTION;

You mean at the trial he did not make any

claim that he was intoxicated?
MR. GORGES:
was intoxicated.

At the time there was testimony that he

He testified, ”1 drank the" —

QUESTION;

Did he. link that to a claim that i>ecaus’e

of that intoxication he did not understand the warning?
MR. CORCES:

Oh* no* sir.

it at all? to that claim.
QUESTION:

Mr. Corces

f

No* sir.

He did not link

7
MRo GORGES;
QUESTION:

Yes , sir.
— let me focus on this, because some of

your comments have confused me a little bit»

Maybe I should

ask this question of your opponent»
Is the respondent claiming that what he said was
involuntary, or is he claiming that he didn’t understand the
Miranda warnings?
MR» GORGES:

He is clairaing that he did not under­

stand the Miranda warnings , because he was too intoxicated to
understand them»
QUESTION 2

I think - personally, there’s a distinctior,

between those two.
MR. GORGES:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And you feel it is the latter?
MR. GORGES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Well, if your opponent doesn't agree,

maybe he csa help me out.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coreas, let me ask you on® more

question, because I’m not quit® sure of hew you answered on®
of Mr. Justice White's questions.

As I read Judge Simpson’s

opinion, for the Fifth Circuit, that court ordered the State
to conduct an. evidentiary hearing.

That: would suggest, to me

that the Fifth Circuit did not feel that the State record
contained all of the evidence necessary fee determine this new
claim

8

MR. CORCES;

That is correct* sir.

It gave

Florida ninety days to conduct a Jackson vs. Denno hearing.
QUESTIONS So the net of it is- anyway, that if
collateral proceedings were open as much as direct-appeal
proceedings are to plain error claims* there wouldn't be a
plain error apparent on the face of this record?
MR. CORCES;

No* sir* there is no plain error appar­

ent on the fao-s of this recorda
As I stated aforesaid* Mr. Sykes * subsequent to having
his petitions denied in State court, filed a petition
Federal District Court for the Tampa Division.

in the

That court

held that Mr. Sykes was not bound by his procedural default,
and gave Florida ninety days within which to conduct a Jackson
vs. Denno hearing.

But under Florida procedure, it can’t be

conducted, sc the Stats of Florida sought and obtained
permission to appeal to the Fifth Circuit.
The. Fifth Circuit affirmed, stated that it is
incumbent upon a trial judge to conduct a Jackson vs. Danno
hearing, even though an admission or an inculpatory statement
is not challenged.

And further that, inasmuch as Florida had

not proven — placed the burden on Florida — that Florida had
not proven that the procedural default was a tactical
decision by Mr. Sykes.,that he was not bound by the procedural
default.
We submit that both the federal court, the district

9
court, and the Fifth Circuit were in error.
I would like to make it clearly ’understood to the
Court that we do not question the power of a federal district
court to consider federal claims, even when there has been a
procedural default.

We are talking about the appropriate

exercise of that power under principles of comity, federalism,
and the appropriates administration of criminal justice, where a
State has a procedural rule.
And we submit that principles of comity and federal”
iam require that federal courts forego habeas relief where a
petitioner has committed an inexcusable procedural default
resulting in the failure to develop the historica], facts
contemporaneously with a timely presentation of the claim.
Now,

I submit that in such cases denial of relief

should be the rule instead of the exception.

And I fully

recognize that this may conflict somewhat with what the Court
said in Fay vs. Nola, that, it conflicts with the dicta in
Fay? it does not conflict with the holding in Fay.
Because in Fay, as I understand the case, there was
a timely objection at the trial level.

In Fay, as. I understand

the case, the historical facts were developed at the trial
level.

In Fay, what occurred was that the procedural default

was in failing to appeal, but the historical facts were
developed, they were there for an appellate court to understand
them? and, in fact, if X recall in Fay the State conceded that

10
the confession had been coerced»
was an intentional bypass.

And in Fay , in fact,

there

In Fay, there was an intentional

bypass, but this Court found that it had been coerced.

In

other words, there was causa for failing to appeal.
Which brings me to what I would submit to this
Court are the appropriate guidelines, which have already been
enunciated by this Court in Davis vs. United States. And that
is that when there is a State procedural rule, when it is
reasonable and when it has a legitimate State interest, that a
prcedural default of that rule should preclude subsequent
habeas relief, where there has been a default, and that default
has resulted in the failure fee develop the historical facts
unless and until such time as the habeas petitioner demonstratess
not only cause but actual prejudice.
I submit to the Court that the Davis guidelines are
fair to both sides.

They provide a criminal defendant with a

federal forum for the vindication of his constitutional rights.
At the same time it shows proper deference to State procedural
rules which are promulgated to give him the vary constitutional
rights which he seeks to protect.
find Florida has a rule, a criminal procedure rule,
that gives him his Jackson vs. Denno hearing.

All he has to

do is ask for it.
QUESTIONS Well, in this case there wouldn't be much
question of prejudice, would there?

11
MR. GORGES *
QUESTION s
MR.GORGES;

No, sir.
Now, how about cause?
There is no cause. At least none has bes3i

alleged.
He has waived any contention that his trial counsel
or appellate counsel was incompetent.
QUESTION;

Well, you®re talking about guidelines.

What would — what if the prisoner or his counsel just simply
said, "I didn't realize the statement might be objectionable?s?
MR. CORCES; That would not be sufficient under
S3tella vs. Williams, Your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. CORCES;

Just a mistake, just a plain mistake.
No, sir, it would not be sufficient

under Estelle vs, Williams.
QUESTION;

But I suppose your guidelines would

permit claims of inadequate counsel?
MR. CORCES;

oh, yes, sir.

But I think we have inept counsel, we have a separate
constitutional claim.
QUESTION; Well, I suppose — well, it’s a separate
constitutional claim, but I suppose this sort of an approach
would put a good deal of pressure on developing a more
discernible rule about the inadequacy of counsel. What do you
think it ought to be?

How would you state it?

The counsel says, 3I just made a mistake, I should

12

have objected/ but I didn’t."
MR. CORCES;

Is that enough or not?

I think you have to rule — to consider

the entire case and determine whether, in viewing the entire
case, he was reasonably effective counsel.

And of course if

he was not a reasonably effective counsel, considering
probable tactical decisions — and when I say !'by probable
tactical decisions51 I use the objective standard, not the
subjective standard.

I don’t think it would be sufficient for

counsel to come in five years later and say, "I didn't know.”
If there’s a probable tactical decision, that it could have
been based* he is not incompetent.
QUESTION; And would your guidelines permit plain
error exceptions to the rule?
MR. CORCES:

Yes, sir, I think that plain error would

always be an exception if —
QUESTIONx So that if the counsel's failure was plain
enough, or if his mistake was plain enough on the record,
you would ignore the mistake?
MR. CORCES:
QUESTION2

I would think so, yes, Your Honor.
I mean, you — and you would apply

ordinary plain-error standards, whatever they are?
MR. CORCES:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Well, would the plain-error standards

depend on the State plain-error standards?
MR. CORCES;

Well, since it’s & federal constitutional

13

question, I would say it would depend on the federal, what is
the federal plain-error standard, what this Court would —
QUESTIONS

In reviewing federal conditions?

MR. GORGES:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Mr. Corces, may I ask you the question;

Supposing the prisoner, when he was taken into custody, was
given his Miranda warnings by the arresting officer, and he
responded by saying, "I’ve just had two quarts of gin, I don't
know what you're talking about, and all I know is I'm sorry I
killed -this person," words to that effect.

It’s pretty clear

he didn’t understand the warnings, but he is making an
inculpatory statement.
Would that be admissible?
MR. CORCES:

Yes, sir, if he does not object.

His counsel may
QUESTION; Well, supposing his counsel objected at
trial, would the trial judge let that statement in?
MR. CORCES:

I would assume that that would be a

determination for the trial court whether, based on ail the
evidence, his intoxication was such that he could not under­
stand his
QUESTION;

Yes, assume he couldn't understand the

warning.
MR. CORCES;
QUESTION:

I would say it would not be admissible.
It would not be admissible.

14
MRo GORGES:

Yes.

If it please the Court# the Davis approach# cause and
actual prejudice# as I stated# is fair to both sides.

It also

requires a criminal defendant# it forces a criminal defendant
to make his constitutional assertions timely# so that the
State can focus on the particular issue# and this case points
out exactly what I’m talking about»
Whether or not he was so intoxicated that he could
not understand his Miranda warnings# if the State is not put
on notice to this issue# they cannot focus their evidence on
that issue unless they are put on notice as to this issue#
and unless he is forced to make his claim in a timely manner#
then the State is forced to contest this issue maybe years
later when he raises it in federal court»
It also# if it please the Court# simplifies# it
tends to simplify federal habeas proceedings# because# by
forcing a criminal defendant to take advantage of a State
procedural rule which would develop the historical facts# it
would make federal habeas proceedings a lot easier.

All that

they would need# the federal district court would need# is a
transcript of what occurred in State court to determine the
cons titutiona1 is s us.
I would submit to this Court that# in this case# the
respondent Sykes has demonstrated'neither cause nor prejudice#
and that the decisions of the-lower court were in error.

15
Now, as to point two, Jackson vs» Denno,

the Fifth

Circuit held that Jackson vs e Denno nandates a voluntariness
hearing even in the absence of a challenge to the confession.
I find it to be a curious ruling by the Fifth
Circuit, because in 1972 they ruled completely otherwise in a
very similar case to this one.

That one involved a federal

prisoner, and they ruled -that Jackson vs. Dsnno did not mandate
a voluntariness hearing.

In Randall vs. United States, cited

in the brief of petitioner, the Fifth Circuit relies on this
Court's decision in Sims vs. Georgia; but in Sims vs. Georgia,
there was a specific motion to suppress, filed by the
defendant, seeking to suppress his confession.
Whether or not this Court has specifically ruled on
this point, I do not believe it has; however, I have noticed
that in all the opinions that have been written that they
carefully stated "challenged", 35challenged confessions",
?

"challenged confessions", as recently as Michipan vs„ Mosely,
and as recently as Brewer vs. Williams, the confession was
challenged.
To require a trial court, on its own initiative, to
conduct a Jackson vs 0 Denno hearing is to require the trial
judge to interfere with the defense of the case. There may
be many reasons why even the defense would want an .inculpatory
statement in evidence.

It may contain defensive matter.

"Yes, I killed him, but in self-defense".

He may not want to

16

take the witness stand to establish self-defense and his
confession may establish it for him.

It may contain matters

pertaining to insanity# which he would rather not take the
witness stand and rely on#on the confession -that comes into
evidence,,
QUESTIONS But even if the Fifth Circuit’s rule is
right in this case# that the trial judge must initiate the
inquiry into voluntariness# I presume the defendant could
still# if he felt the way you have just described# tell the
trial judge# "No# 7. don’t want a hearing on \Tolunt:.ariness# I
waive that issue,,"
MR. CORCES: That nay be true# sir# Your Honor# but
again if it's done during the course of a trial it’s
interfering with the defense. The defense may not want the
State to focus on the problem.

It may be# as in this case# an

intoxication; he may be claiming, using intoxication as
mitigation.

And by raising the issue# it would allow the

State to focus on what his true defense is# such as intoxica­
tion»
And unless# Mr. Chief Justice# the Court has any
further questions# -that’s all that I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
We’ll hear from Mr. Xorman.
Mr. Karra an

Very well# Mr. Corces.

17
ORAL ARGUMENT OP EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The ultimate issue presented by this case is whether
a defendant who has failed to comply with a State procedural
rule, which gives him a full and fair opportunity to raise a
claim that his confession was obtained without compliance with
this Court's holding in Miranda,can simply march into a federal
court at his pleasure and obtain habeas corpus relief- in a.
new trial.
I think it would be helpful, before detailing our
position on this issue, to speak to the facts of this case in
a little bit more detail.
And there are two points I want to deal with:
First, there is this inconsistency between the order
of the Court of Appeals In this case and the order of the
district court. The district court remanded this case for
Florida to hold a full-blown hearing on the issue of
voluntariness of the confession, what is described, as a
Jackson vs. Denno hearing.
The Court of Appeals, in affirming, said that the
State of Florida need only provide a hearing going to the
issue of whether Miranda had been complied with.

Accorded,

there is some confusion in the Court of Appeals opinioni the

18

Court of Appeals opinion seemed to suggest that had the trial
court initially# on its own# ordered a Jackson vs, Denno
hearing# then counsel’s attention might have been

more

specifically drawn to this issue, and he might have raised
the claim on his own*
And in light of this# I think it's important to take
a brief look at what happened at tin© trial of this case.
The evidence was fairly simple»

Willie Gilbert was shot to

death# on January 8# 1972# within minutes after the crime was
committed the police arrived at the defendant's home» 'Willie
Gilbert was laying about ten feet from the door of the
defendant’s house»

The defendant’s wife came running up to

the police and sh© said, "John shot Willie"; a few minutes
later the defendant walked up to the police and he said# ”1
shot Willie",

They placed him under arrest# and he was then

taken into the police station and interrogated.
At the trial the issue of Miranda was quite evident#
the defense lawyer specifically# on cross-examination of the
police officer# elicited the exact warnings that' were given»
He asked whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time.
He did evvarything except male® a formal motion to suppress

ths evidence on the grounds that Miranda had not been complied
with.
Now# there may very well have been reaon for this,
on the record in this case# because# if you read th© transcript#

19

if you just read the State's case alone, without consideration
of the confession, 'there is an overwhelming case, at least on
the charge for which the defendant was convicted, which was a
kind of manslaughter charge which, in Florida,is denominated
as murder in th© third degree*

The State did not need his

confession on its case-in-chief to prove his guilt.
The confession became relevant only in light of his
defense, that is, the defendant was required in this case, and
th© defendant’s lawyer knew it and everybody els® knew it,
to take the stand and make out a case based on self-defense.
And til at is where his confession, his incriminatory statement,
became particularly pertinent,
Nov/, since there was no claim that this confession
was involuntary in the traditional sense, and there's nothing
in the record of th© trial to indicate that this confession
was involuntary in the traditional sens®, presumably counsel
may have bean aware that once the defendant, took th® stand in
this case, that statement, whether Miranda was complied with
or not, could have been used fco impeach the credibility of his
self-defense testimony.

And there may very well have been —

counsel may very well have felt that, what's th® point of
maing an objection on the State’s direct case when the evidence
is going to come in anyway when l put my cliexiit on th® stand,
and he's impeached by his prior — his confession.
And what happens in a case like this, if the Court

20
says that in these circumstances a defendant can, nevertheless
obtain habeas corpus relief, is that another case arising in
a similar context, there will be absolutely no reason for a
defense counsel to object»

He could figure;

well, it's going

to come in anyway on the defense case, 1 won91 object on the
prosecution's case;? they will impeach his credibility, and I
will try for the acquittal, but, if not, 1 could always go into
federal court and obtain a writ of habeas corpus»
I think, in the context of what happened here, end
the manner in which this confession could have been used and
in which counsel may have anticipated it could have beer, used,
he simply may have felt that it would b© pointless to raise fehei
objection on the direct case»
And it is in this context that I think we

have to

look at the issue of whether he can now come into a federal
court and obtain habeas corpus relief without ever having
complied with a reasonable State procedural rule,
QUESTION;
bit on the• facts?

Mr. Kerman, will you refresh me a little
The confession was used in the direct: case,

and of cburse it acknowledged
MR» KORMAN:
QUESTION;

the shooting.

That’s right.
what in the confession was inconsistent

— was there something in the confession inconsistent with
the self-defense theory, is that your point?
MR» KORMANs

Yas „

Yes® The confession indicated

21
there had been soma altercation* that the defendant lost his
temper and just shot the victim.

It was quite cl€s.ar from the

confession that — which we set out. at page 5 in our brief
that it was not in self-defense.
QUESTIONS
MR. KORMAN:

I SO®.
And* of course*

it would have been

admitted to impeach his credibility* regardless of whether
Miranda was complied with.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Roman* was the testimony of the wife

admissible against the husband or not?
MR. KORMAN:
defense witness.

I'm not certain. She testified as a

She was not terribly helpful* because she

said that she did not. see the shooting* she was net clear as
to the events which preceded it* and —•
QUESTION?

Did she acknowledge that she

held

said*

"John shot him”?
MR. KORMAN:
Justice.

I believe that she did* Mr. Chief

I believe that she did.
QUESTION:

It would be pretty difficult for her to

avoid it* or at .least to open the door to have the policeman
testify that.she said so.
MR. KORMAN:

That's right.

And it may-- even if

she had not testified* that, statement might have been
admissible as part of what we call the res, gestae.
QUESTIONn

There was never any question who shot him*

22

was there?
MR» KORMANs

No, never any question that he shot him®

And that was conceded»

That’s why I say that it may have been

understandable why the defendant’s lawyer didn’t raise the
issue»
QUESTIONS

If her testimony was simply that "John

shot him", without any mere explanation, might tend to under­
mine his self-defense claim»
MR» KQRMAN:

Of course, and I think it’s important to

keep in mind that before he was placed under arrest, which
would trigger the Miranda issue, h© had walked up, shortly
after his wife had said that "John shot Willie", he admitted
himself that nI shot Willie", without any qualifying selfdefense explanation for it»
QUESTION?

And then the warning came afterward,

did it?
MR. KORMAN:

That’s right, the warnings came when

he was questioned at the station house»
QUESTION;

What was Ii@ charged with?

MR, KORMAN:

He was originally charged with murder

in the second degree, which is that he —
QUESTION5

Not with first degree?

MR» KORMAN:

No, not first degree.

unintentional k.i1ling.
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s what I mean.

It was an

23
MR» KORMANi

That’s what he was originally charged

with* and wh&fc he was convicted of was an even lesser degree
of an unintentional killing? and he was sentenced to ten years*
of which he has now served five.
And the question becomess

why should he new bs

entitled to habeas corpus relief?
After this Court decided Davis v\ United States* which
held that the knowing and deliberate waiver standard did not
apply in a habeas corpus proceeding where the defendant failed
to comply with a reasonable procedural rule* Rule 12(b)(2)*
which dealt with defects in th© institution of the prosecution*
th® court* and I think it's critical that it was after Davis *
gave this construction to Rule 12(f) in the context of the
habeas corpus case»

This Court araended the federed rules of

criminal procedure* that is* promulgated an amendment which
added to the motions that must be mad© before trial or be
deemed waived all suppression motions»
And that procedural rule which this Court promulgated
did not simply go into effect by congressional inaction*
Congress affirmatively adopted and approved that amendment»
And. so it. seems clear to us that* absent cause* to relieve him
from th© waiver provision* a federal prisoner could not coma
into a federal court and get this relief* after Davis and after
the amendment of Rule 12(b)(3)* and we think it's equally
clear* as a result of this Court’s opinion in Francis vs.

24
Headers em, that a State prisoner cannot do any better than a
federal prisoner would have in the face of a reasonable State
procedural rule»
And, Mr. Justice White raised the question of what
would constitute cause, to relieve the defendant from the
waiver provisions. And we believe that cause means; prejudice
in the sense of his right: to

a fair trial „ in the sense that

the habeas corpus statute: is really intended to deal with?
that is., to insure that an innocent man is not confined to
prison,
QUESTION?

So you don’t — you do differ, then, with

your colleague?
MR. KORMAN:

That's right.

And to deal with your

point with respect to counsel, we think that the reason that
counsel was provided — and I think you have to, when you'll
answer the question about what about the inadequacy of counsel
claim, that counsel didn't raise it because he's inadequate,
I think you have to look at it in the perspective of what is
the purpose of a habeas corpus proceeding,
QUESTION:

So you wouldn't open up habeas corpus to

plain-error claims, neither, unless it went to the —
MR. KORMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.
— unless it went to the integrity of

the fact-finding process?
MR. KORMAN:

That's right.

Of course, as Your Honor

25
developed In his questioning,, there was no plain error here#
you cannot look at the record of this case and say that -there
was any error.
But w© think that when -QUESTION; And your counsel claims would be subject
to the same standards?
MR. KORMAN: Well# that’s right. We think that the
same test of prejudice is :

What did he lose as a rcjsulfc of the

failure of his counsel to make this objection# regardless of
the reason for it?
QUESTION; And even if any fool should have known
enough to object# if there’s no indication that the evidence
is unreliable# there should b© no federal habeas; is that it?
MR. KORMAN:

That’s right.

Because I think we have

to — there ar© ether values that enter the picture when you' re
dealing with motions that axe mad© years after the trial#
which could have basn mad© earlier.

And the question then, particularly when you are
dealing with a State procedural rule# is;
as a result of counsel’s inadequacy?

What did you lose

You lost the right to

exclude this statement that was taken without full compliance
with Miranda# but was the statement coerced in the traditional
sense?

Ho.

Was it unreliable?

No.

Well# then# vrhy then

should we not give some consideration to questions of
finality?

26

QUESTION; Do you put in the scales the

fact that,

as you’ve suggested earlier, this statement was inevitably
going to come in once the defendant took the stand?
MR. KORMAN;

I think that also weighs in the scales

in this particular case, because I think, aside from the
stipulation that the defendant made that he was not claiming
his counsel was inadequate, I think it suggests that counsel
may have made a deliberate decision? and I would reiterate that
if this Court were to now hold — and I don’t know whether in
this case counsel made a deliberate decision? if I were to
guess- I would say he didn't — but if this Court were to now
hold that in a case just like this federal habeas corpus is
available, then there would be no incentive for the defense
lawyer to make the objection, because he knows it's got to come;
in anyway to impeach the credibility of his defendant,if the
defendant doesn't take the stand he's surely going to be:
convicted.
So why make the motion, if you can get another
crack at the apple by obtaining a habeas corpus ruling?
Nov/, I also —
QUESTION;

Mr. Kantian, may I ask one other question

about the impeachment point you made earlier?

Did, in fact,

the prosecutor use the statement to impeach the defense
testimony?
MR. KORMAN;

I believe that he did

21
QUESTION:

He did.

Because you didn't mention that

in your brief.
MR. KORMANs

I believe he did, but it’s been, a

little bit of time sine© I've read the complete transcript.
QUESTION:

Your brief doesn't identify a contradic™

tion between the defense testimony and the statement.

You say

it might have been used for that purpose., but I didn't find it
in the brief.
MR. KORMAN:

Well, the defendant s ai d, I believe,

in his confession that Gilbert came to his trailer, was
playing around with the gun.

He told him to put the shotgun

down, so Willie put it down and went, into the yard.

The

respondent said in his confession that he followed him out
to tii® yard, then Willi© turned around and patted his butt
at him, like this, and I shot him. Which is completely
inconsistent with the testimony that we have set cut at page
7 and 8 of our brief, in which he purports to claim that he
was afraid that —- h® shot him because he was afraid that he
was going to com® running back at him and attack him in soma
way.
I mean, they are completely inconsistent.
There is just one more point that I want to make.
We would not necessarily bs making the

same argument., and

I think it's important to make this point, if w© were dealing
with the claim that the confession was involuntary as a matter

28
of fact,, that this was a traditional Involunfcariness argument*
because in cases like that there is always the element that
an involuntary confession may be unreliable* and so that when
you get into the context of a claim of true involuntariness*
then another question arises that perhaps an innocent man
may be convicted? and in that context we would think that if
there was no other evidence except a coerced confession*
which was the case in Fay vs*, Nola* there was a coerced
confession obtained by the most blatantly improper and un­
constitutional means, there was not a shred of ether evidence
«
in the case* then we would think that that might be an
appropriate cas® to excuse a procedural default*. '
And perhaps Florida would* under those circumstances*
as well. And I think that particularly apposite here* and we
quote it at length in our brief, as this Court’s opinion in
Jenkins y» Delaware* if you will recall in Johnson va Hew
Jersey the Court said that Miranda would be applied retro­
actively to all trials which took place after the date of
its decision? in Jfexxkins ys*. Delaware, the Court said* well*
that didn't apply to retrials where the conviction had been
reversed after Miranda* and the defendant was scheduled to be
tried again*.
And the reasons that the Court gave are really the
basic reasons why we believe that habeas corpus should be
denied in this particular context. And that is* the Court said

29
that when a trial had not yet commenced* it was relatively
close in point of -time to the date that the crime was committee*
that lav; enforcement officers could attempt to reconstruct
their case* while memories

were still fresh.

But when you

are dealing with a conviction that was reversed* probably
years have gone by* much more difficult to reconstruct a case*
particularly where the prosecutor had relied on the confession
as an essential part of his case»
So that the Court said;

for these reasons, even

though Miranda applies to trials that took place after the
date of the holding, we're not going to apply it to retrials»
And those same underlying considerations of policy
apply equally here»
But* the Court said* -the defendant can still take
advantage * perhaps* of the rule that if he could show that
his confession was truly involuntary* as a matter of fact*
then maybe he can get relief»
And that is the basic analysis here* so that I think
it’s quite clear that the Court

of Appeals erred in — and

both the district court and the Court of Appeals erred in
granting habeas corpus relief in the context of the case like
this«
I wonder* Mr» Chief Justice* if I could reserve my
remaining time for some rebuttal.
Thank you

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Very well.
Mr. easier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. CASLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CASLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the

Court;
I am Court-appointed to represent John Sykes,
name is William F. easier.

My

I am from St. Petersburg Beach,

Florida.
First of all, both the petitioner and the amicus have
totally ignored Florida’s rule, a very specific rule that has
to do specifically and only with suppression of confessions
and admissions; no other evidence.
suppression of other evidence.

We have other rules for

Our rule that we tire here on

today is 3.190, has to do specifically with, admissions and
confessions, and it's very important.
This rule was adopted and has been the practice of
Florida for years, since 1919, in a Supreme Court of Florida
case, Stiner vs. State.

The rule follows that case law, and

not only that but Florida, is adopting, July 1st of this year,
an evidentiary rule which follows this explicitly.
Now, this rule says, "Upon motion" — it’s in my
brief, both the federal rule and the State rule are side by
side, at page 2 is the State rule, and on page 3 is the federal
rule. And they are totally inconsistent with one another, and

31

totally distinguishable»
The? Florida rule says:

"Upon motion of the defendant"

~ and then it says., itcs disjunctive, it says "or upon its
own motion, the Court shall suppress any confession or
admission obtained illegally from the defendant»"
And 1 think 'this is the basis — tills was my argument
in the district court and it was my argument in the Fifth
Circuit, and both
that

in the Fifth Circuit, the judgment of

Court, the opinion of that Court follows this rule»
QUESTION3 Well, isn't that assumed that someone is

going to call the trial judge's attention to the matter by
objection?
MR. CASLER:
QUESTION.-

No, sir, I don't think so»
It doesn’t preclude the judge from acting

on his own, but you suggest that there is no consequence of
the failure to draw the matter to the Court's attention.
MR. CASLER:

We have absolutely nothing in our rules

that says, "If you fail to do this, defendant, you have
waived anything".
QUESTION: Well, doesn’t it at least suggest that
there has to be some evidence produced before the judge which
would motivate him to act on his own motion?
MR. CASLER*
coming in is enough»

A confession coming in — an admission
It says he shall

that no confession

or admission shall —» pardon me, "the Court shall suppress any

confession or admission obtained illegally from the defendants,
Now, how does the Court know that unless there is a
hearing to find out if it was a voluntary confession?
QUESTION: Well, if it said it in just the words you
recited, you might have a pretty good argumento As I read it,
it doesn’t say it in quite those words*
MRo CASLER:

Florida*

All righto

This is the practice of

This is -the practi.ce of Florida»

that I practice in, this is the practice»

In the Circuits
The defendant, if

he doesn't do anything, the judge has a hearing, automatically
QUESTION; Well, why didn't the judge have a hearing
in this case?
MR» CASLERs

This rule came in in 1972. This

defendant went to trial in 1972.
QUESTION: Before the rule came in?
MR» CASLER:

No, sir.

No, sir.

Shortly ~ six

months after this rule went in.
QUESTION:

Would you say the rule was just too new

for the judge to know about it?
MR» CASLER;

That could have bean, I don’t know.

But when we get to the cases on this, it's obvious, and the
new law, the new evidentiary rule that’s coming in *— well, in
fact, if you will turn to page 26 of the brief, it will —
in July 1, 1977, this year

now, this is a legislative act,

the rule was a Supreme Court of Florida, an integrated bar.

33

Rule 3.190 is by the Supx'eme Court of Florida.

Now we've got

a legislative act that strengthens the rule that I’ve just
recited.

"This act shall apply to both civil and criminal

cases brought after the effective date of this act.,,. Nothing
in this section shall preclude a court from taking notice, of
fundamental errors affecting substantial rights, even though
such errors were not brought to the attention of the trial
judge."
QUESTION; Does that tell us very much?

You don't

need a rule or a statute to have a judge have authority to
take notice of something that he thinks affects the fairness
of the trial.

It doesn’t say the judge shall hold a hearing,

as I thought you admitted, it says he shall not be prevented,
even in the absence of a motion, from acting on his own.
MR. CASLER:

The way I construe the rule, our rule

in Florida, is that the defendant shall do this on his motion
or the judge will do it. on his own motion, to see that no
admission or confession comes in illegally.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. easier, why have a motion by

the defendant at all if the judge is obliged to do it?
MR. CASLER;

I think that's a good point, and I think

that’s exactly the way it should be, and that’s what the
district -~
QUESTION;
the judge must do it

Well, I’m asking the question.

You say

34

MR» CASLER:

Yes # sir,

QUESTION; Well# why doss the rule say "upon motion
of the defendant or the judge"?

Why not just say the judge

shall do it?
MR, CASLER;

Because the case law says that — on

page 19 of my brief# and this is a 1919 case and it8s still
the law of Florida,, it's been followed all these years# it's
still being followed# and it is the basis for this rule
in Sidner

State;
"The question of whether admissions or confessions

are made fraely or voluntarily is for the Court to determine.;
to enable it to do this# there should be preliminary’
investigation by the court# and this examination should be
made in the absence of the jury.

While we think it is best

for counsel to interpose objections to the introduction of
evidence of admissions or confessions# in order that the court
may make the preliminary investigation to determine its
admissibility# that does not relief the trial judge of the
duty when evidence of this character

is sought to be introduced

to satisfy himself that the admissions were freely and
voluntarily made before admitting them."
QUESTION:

Of course# in the 1919 casa I presume

the Supreme Court of Florida was talking about the voluntary
confessions in the traditional non-coerced sence, rather than
just in tent® of confessions which were made without proper

35

Miranda warnings.
MR® CASLER:

Well, I would imagine — I don’t know

whafc the -QUESTIONS

It would haw had remarkable foresight,

let’s say, if they had been talking about the last®
MR® CASLER: Well, I think it probably may have? had
remarkable foresight.
QUESTIONs Then, Mr® easier,
MR. CASLERs

*

It seems quite clear to me what I have

just read.
QUESTION %

that hasn’t been the rule in Florida

since 1919 — what happened about the Chambers case that came
to this Court?

They didn't put 'that rule in that one®

MR® CASLER:

Well, wa are here on this case® too,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes, well, you're back to 1919, I want

to bring you a little closer, to the Chambers case.
MR® CASLER: All I can say is that there was

error

in the Sykes case that should have been done this way, if it
had been done this way we wouldn't be here®

Not only that,

if Florida followed this rule, there would never be any habeas
corpus on the voluntariness of a confession.
QUESTION:

I understand, under the Florida rule, all

you have to do is to say one word, two words:
MR. CASLERs

That's true.

I object.

36

QUESTION:

Isn’t that what Florida says?

MR. CASLER: And if you don’t say it.- the judge has a
hearing, Your Honor, before any confession is —
QUESTION;

No, Florida says the only tiling necessary

to get a hearing, a full-blown hearing, is to say "I object*'.
MR. CASLER:

That's true.

QUESTION; And that’s too much to expect?
MR. CASLER:

Ho, sir.

No, Your Honor. But if you

fail to do that, the court has a hearing.
QUESTION: Well, ar® you arguing that 'the Constitution
requires the judge to hold a hearing on his own?
)

Is that your

argument here?
MR. CASLER:
QUESTION:

No.
Or is it --

MR. CASLER:

But the petitioner was giving soma

guidelines, and I'm giving what I feel is guidelines based
on our rule.

The amicus is here on a federal rule, and the

federal rule is fc?tally different than this.
It says that if you don't do this, it’s waived.
And then you can

come in and show cause.

Our rule doesn't

/

say that w
QUESTION: Well,

let's see, are you saying that ~

looking at the top of page 3 of your brief, subdivision (3)
of the State rule, "The Court shall receive evidence on any
issue of fact” and so forth.

3?

MR» CASLER;
QUESTIONS

Yes?
Now, are you saying that under your rule

the practice has been and is that whenever the government, the
State, offers an admission or confession, automatically the
trial judge must say;

Stop, we will have . a hearing out of

the presence of the jury»
MR» CASLER;

Sends the jury out and we have a hearing»

QUESTION;

Is that what you’re saying?

Yes, sir.
•

MR. CASLER;

Yes, I am.

QUESTION;

Is that what your rule means?

MR. CASLER;

And I*m saying that's what the rule says

and does, and that's why our Circuit followed this.
QUESTION; And so, are you arguing this just to
explain why he didn't object?

Or are you arguing that there's

a federal constitutional requirement that a judge, absent any
objection, conduct a hearing?
MR. CASLER:

Which are you arguing?

I'm arguing this to counter what the

amicus curiae has .said, trying to relate Federal Rule 12 to
the -— what we were operating under.
QUESTION:
with our question

Well, what has either approach got to do
our question here is whether the Federal

Constitution has bean violated, isn't it?
MR. CASLER; Well, yes, sir, and this is to --QUESTION: Well, how was it violated here?

38
MRo CASLER:

It was violated by allowing a confession

to corae in without any determination at any time anywhere as
to voluntariness of that confession,
QUESTION: So you do argue that the Constitution
requires the judge to hold a hearing on his own, absent any
objection?
MR, CASLER:

Yes, I do.

QUESTION: Well now, do you think, in this kind of a
case, anyway, if you tie the objection to the Constituti.on,
you would say this was contrary to the Fifth Amendment, if
you were objecting, wouldn't you?
MR, CASLER:
QUESTION:

I would.

Absolutely,

And that it’s compelling a person to

testify against hiroself?
MR, CASLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Nov;, normally, in any trial, you make a.

person claim his Fifth Amendment objection, you always do,
don’t you?
MR. CASLER:
a

QUESTION:

When he —
If he thinks he's coerced into making an

incriminating statement, he should state his objection.

That's

the normal Fifth Amendment rule, isn't it?
MR. CASLER:

That's true.

QUESTION: Well, why should it be any different her®?
MR, CASLER:

I consider this rule, the confession and

39
admission coming in, no different -than the waiver of a jury
trial or anything else.
QUESTION:

But this is a Fifth Amendment case*

This is a Fifth Amendment objection, and normally you make
people claim their privilege.
MR. CASLER:
the Fifth Amendment,
QUESTION:

When they are a witness and they take
if you are asking them questions.
Well, this person is claiming his

privilege not to have his own statements used against him.
MR. CASLER:

That3s possible.

I9ve never asked a

defendant, "Do you want to take the Fifth Amendment?" in a
trial.

I do ask him whether or not they want the confession

to corae in. And if they do, we go to the judge and we tell
the judge.
QUESTION;

Well, in your own practice, when you're

trying cases and the Stats offers an admission or confession,
what do year do?

You personally, what do you do?

MR. CASLER:
QUESTION:

When what, sir?
In your own practice, the State offers a

confession or an admission, what do you do?
MR. CASLER:
before trial.

I file a motion to suppress five weeks

Or idle day I get it.

I file a motion to

Not on this

point. They did not --- the attorney that handled the trial was
the appellate counsel, and he did not raise this on appeal.
Subsequent to that time, after the defendant, from
prison, filed a motion to vacate with the trial judge, then
he went back to the district court that handled the appeal
and did a habeas corpus, and the court entered a very short
opinion denying it, said that it had bean considered on appeal.
Then hs went to the Supreme Court of Florida, and
they denied it for lack of jurisdiction,

The Fifth Circuit,

They say that there- is a

responsibility and that the trial judge should have a hearing.
QUESTION.-;

So that two other Florida lawyers, whom

your client has stipulated to have been effective counsel,
apparently were not aware of this practice under the rule?

44
MRo CASLER:

Your Honor, that was the same counsel

that handled the trial did the appeal. And that was in 1972,
when this rule came in.

Now, whether he knew the rule or

didn't knew the rule, I'm not ~ I don't know*
Nov?, Mr. Corces said —
QUESTION;

He might have realised it v/ould be very

difficult, for him to explain to the court why he didn't object.
Maybe that was the reason he didn’t raise it on appeal.
MR. CASLER:

It could have been.

I really don’t

know.
QUESTIONS
MR* CASLER:

We're just speculating.
Now, in Florida, Mr. Corots says that

if you don't raise this issue in Florida, then you've waived
it.

You can't bring collateral attack.
There is a myriad of cases that I've cited in my

brief on pages IS and 16 that are contrary to this. The
Florida holding ist,

a procedural default of failing to appeal

is not equivalent to an express waived, of a constitutional
right, and will not preclude collateral attack of an unlawful
conviction.
I am not going to read all these cases, they are
all saying the same thing.

Holding that failure to object at

a trial to a deHiial of a fundamental right does not act as a
procedural default to estop collateral attack.
necessary for a defendant

It is not

to have objected at trial at all.

45
There are at. least 10 or 15 cases on pages 15 and 16
that hold that.
QUESTION; Do you think there should be a different
approach to this kind of a case. where there was no challenge
to the commission of the act# that is# the shooting# that only
a plea and confession mid avoidance# that is# self-defense?
MR. CASLER:
QUESTION;

I don't know.
Isn’t it a perfectly logical thing for a

man who is going to say# "Yes# I shot him# but I did it in
self-defense18 to fail to object to a policeman testifying to
his statements?
MR. CASLER; Except that the statement that he mad®
doesn't tie into self-defense at all# as the Fifth Circuit
pointed out fcha facts in their opinion# said that- the facts of
what he —
QUESTION: Well# self-defense assumes an admission of
having performed the act# does it not?
MR. CASLER:

No question about it.

H© said# "I shot

him", and then he went into a long detail 'that had nothing
to do with self-defensa9 in the confession.
QUESTION:

Do you think what the State courts did

here are contrary to the cases that you cited at the bottom of
page 15?
Is- there a — should the Stats courts have entertained
a collateral proceeding?

46

MR. CASLER;
QUESTION:

Absolutely» Absolutely.
Well, how are we to undarstend the Stats

of State law is that such claims that aren't pressed at trial
are not available on federal habeas, on State habeas?
MR. CASLER:
QUESTXQNs

The ~
Which is what happened here.

MR. CASLER: That is correct.

The habeas in -die

the defendant did file there from jail, his own motion with
that court.

That court did enter an op ini on, it's cited in

the brief, and said that they had already considered this.
Tliat*s what the opinion says.
Now, the petitioner and the amicus have pointed out
that the district court that made that opinion mad© a mistake.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES CORCES, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CORCES:

May I clarify a couple of things for

th© Court?
First, 'the rule of procedure has bean in Florida
since 1963, not 1972.

It's cited in the brief as a 1972

rule, but that rule has been in effect in Florida since 196 8.
But since, every year, Florida, seems to publish the Rules of
Procedure , I cited them as a IS72 rule.
QUESTION:

Do you have a Florida case that says

if you don’t make it you waive it?

51
MR» CORCES:

Yes, sir* it's cited in the briefs»

On© other pointy I went through every case cited
by tli© respondent in his brief , there is not on® case that
holds that it's not a waiver if you fail to object? not one
