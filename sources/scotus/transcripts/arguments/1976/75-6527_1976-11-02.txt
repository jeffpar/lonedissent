ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROGOWs

Mr. Chief Justice, mid may it please the

Court s
Thar® are three issues in -this case.
The first issue is whether or not the. Eighth Amendment's
cruel and unusual punishment clause has any application to public
school students who are beaten by their teachers or principals.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held, in effect, that no matter how brutal, how severe,
how excessive a beating is inflicted upon public school
students, they may seek no relief under the Eighth Amendment.
That is the first issue.
The second issue is;

If the Eighth Amendment doss

apply, as we submit it does, whether or net the facts of this
case show that these students* Eighth Amendment rights have
been violated.
And the third issue, which is separate and distinct,
is;

Whether or not any corporal punishment inflicted by an

instrument designed to cause bodily injury, whether or not that
punishment must be preceded by some opportunity to be heard

4
under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. The
Court of Appeals decision was that 'there was no need, for such a
hearing,
QUESTION:

Mr* Rogow, are you going to discuss those

point by point?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir., I will, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

In fact, I turn now to the Eighth. Amendment argument.
Th® effect of the Court of Appeals decision, as I
mentioned, is to give carte blanche to teachers and principals
to punish corporally, as severely, as excessively as they may
do, and there will be no recourse under the Eighth Amendment.
The decision seems to focus on the issue of whether
or not the punishment is imposed in a criminal setting or a
civil setting, and the Court of Appeals held that the Eighth
Amendment only applies in the criminal context.
We believe that decision missos th© point of the
Eighth Amendment,

Th® focus of the Eighth Amendment is upon

punishment, it is not upon who delivers th© punishment.
The original purpose of —
QUESTION:
it if

You say it has no focus on who delivers

if s stranger walks up to you on the street and hits

you over the head with a. club, that's probably some punishment,
but does th© Eighth Amendment apply there?
MR. ROGOW:
because -

No, it does not, Mr. Chief Justice,

5

QUESTION:

You are talking about the authority of

government in scm© way, aren’t you?
MR. ROGOWs
of State law.

Exactly.

Punishment imposed under color

Which are ‘the facts of this case, and which is

•the kind of punishment we’re talking about here.
The original purpose of the Eighth Amendment was to
preclude the barbaric kinds of punishments which were known
in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth Centuries
in England and on the Continent.
And, to be sure, the Drafters looked back — looked
at history and saw terrible punishments imposed in a criminal
context, generally? and that is what they sought to ban in the
eighth Amendment, because that is what they saw in the past.
But that does not

mean that there was to be no ban on punish­

ments imposed by other people, acting under color of State law,

if those punishments were excessive and severe.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Rogov/, you were here this morning,

weren’t you, during the argument of that fight in the Columbus
bar case?
MR. ROGOW:

QUESTION:

Yes, I was, Mr. Justice.

You heard some of the questioning there.

Supposing the policeman in that case had simply pistol-whipped
one of the plaintiffs there, would you say that could be a

cruel and unusual punishment?
MR. ROGOv?;

If ha had done it as a summary punishment:

6
arresting the person, taking him into custody and then summarily
punishing him, depriving him of a right to be tried, then I
could say that would be a violation of a due process right,
but not cruel and unusual punishment»
QUESTION; Why would you say it wasn't a cruel and
unusual punishment?
MR. ROGOW;

I would say it wasn’t a cruel and unusual

punishment because —* it's a difficult question, Mr» Justice
Rehnquist —* probably because it has not been addressed in that
context.

Generally there is a clear constitutional right that

has been violated, but, as I reflect on it, I think that could
begin to give rise to a cruel and unusual punishment»

The

only withdrawing I might do from that position might be that
that kind of punishment is not authorised at all by law,
where the kind of punishment wa're talking about here is, at
the outset, authorized by law5 and then it’s exceeded.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rogow, you admit that during the time

of the adoption of the Eighth Amendment that corporal punishment
was the order of the day?
MR. ROGOW;

Yes, it was, in a limited context,

reasonable corporal punishment.
QUESTION: They even had it in criminal by whipping
at the stake, didn't they?
MR. ROGOW; They did. And this Court has'recognized,
though, that the Eighth Amendment is a dynamic

evolving

7

concept, and what may have been tolerated at the time of the
adoption of the Eighth Amendment hasn't been tolerated as we
have progressed in our society standards of decency and
civilised notions have progressed.
QUESTIONt And what about the — do you take the
position that all corporal punishment is violation?
HR. ROGOV/';

Ho, we do not, Mr. Justice Marshall,

QUESTION:

You're only arguing this case?

MR. ROGOV/:

We're only arguing this case, and we5 re

not in —-

saying that reasonable corporal punishment will not be a
violation of the Eighth Amendment.
We are saying that physical corporal punishment
imposed by an instrument will have to be preceded by an
opportunity for a hearing. That is our Fourteenth Amendment
argument, which is separate and distinct from this.
But we are not seeking to outlaw all corporal punishitienfc in a public school context, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

And what would be the issue at the hearing

if idiere were one?
MR. ROGOV/: The issue would be, at that hearing,
whether- or not the student did in fact cominit the offense for*
which he is being punished^
QUESTION:

And also even if he did, whether or not

corporal punishment would be called for?

8

MR. ROGOW:

Certainly the kind of punishment that

ought to be inflicted,. yes? Mr. Justice Brennan»
QUESTIONj

.

What constitutional interest? under

your Fourteenth Amendment argument? is cue. student deprived of
without due process of lav/ if such a hearing is not held?
MR. ROGOW?

He is deprived of a liberty interest?

Mr. Justice Rehnquist? a liberty interest that is drawn? really?
from nearly all the Amendments of the Constitution.
question?

All twenty-six?

MR. ROGOW:

No? I’m sorry»

At least the first Ten?

Mr. Justice Relinquish.
The liberty interest? the right to be treated with
human dignity is at least an interest in liberty.
QUESTION? Where is the right to be treated with, human
dignity ~~ where is that stated in the Constitution?
MR. ROGOU:
QUESTION:

It is net specifically stated.
It's among the penumbras.

MR..ROGOW: It’s among the penumbras? and included
among the penumbras are — and let me list these rights that
have been violated? that; we think make up the constellation of
factors involving liberty.

The right to be free from bodily

restraint? and a student is restrained; the right to be free
from intrusion —
QUESTION:

Now? what snares — will you name the

Amendment which is the source?

9

MR. ROGOWs

I can't name specific amendments.

come to the Fourth Amendment? perhaps?
of intrusion that's involved.

I can

for the physical kind

But this Court has never

required a specific Amendment to be named when one is talking
about liberty? because the concept of liberty is broad? it
includes an awful lot of privileges that are essential to the
practice of liberty by free people and free children.
QUESTIONs

Your idea of liberty? then? is just what

any one person -thinks of it?
MR. ROGOWs

Me? it is not? Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION:

Or what on© out of five think of it?

MR. .ROGOWs
QUESTION;

It may be what
Is that what you think liberty is?

MR. ROGOWs

No? I think liberty is something that «—

QUESTION;

And you don't have to pinpoint it?

MR. ROGOWs

I think we do have to pinpoint it? and I'm

attempting to pinpoint it by looking at a host of factors?
which this Court has looked at many times in deciding whether
I

or not there is or is not a liberty interest.
The freedom from bodily restraint? from bodily intru­
sion? from officers acting under color of State law

beatings?

in effect —- the freedom from being stigmatised? ridiculed?
psychologically harmed? having one's privacy invaded? having
one’s reputation, honor and integrity invaded.

Wien the

government does that? acting under color of State lav;? we submit;

10
that those things constitute a deprivation of liberty.
But that,. Mr, Justice Marshall, is my due process
argument.

And I would like to gat back to my Eighth Amendment

argument, and then address these due process issues once again,
The Court has recognised in -the Eighth Amendment
concept — because we think this is important — that a
principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than
the mischief which gave it. birth. The Court said that in
Weems- vs» United States , where it held unconstitutional, as an
Eighth Amendment violation, twelve years at hard labor for
fraudulently signing a public document.
And in Robinsca vs. California, the Court held -that
imprisonment for drug addiction could amount to cruel and
unus ua1 punishment«
Go the Court has recognised that the Eighth Amendment
is a dynamic evolving concept, and that it focuses upon punish­
ment.

And that's what we have in this case.

We have excessive

punishment that the Fifth Circuit would tolerate and say the
Sightii Amendment offers no relief from,
QUESTION i
well as forward?

Can the Eighth Amendment go backwards as

If something is a cruel and unusual punishment

ten years ago, if evidence shows that it's — there’s a great
deal of need for it and -the need can't be mot in other ways,
could then something become not cruel and unusual?
MR. ROGOVJs

There certainly could be changing in

11
evolving standards# of what; would be tolerated by society«
So there could be some, change because# as I said# the Fifth
Circuit is flexible and dynamic,

I'm sorry, the Eighth

Amendment, is flexible and dynamic»

The Fifth Circuit was not

so flexible in this case»
[Laughter» 3
Because w<a think the Eighth Amendment applies# we
turn to the facts of this case# which we think shows a violation
of the Eighth Amendment# and these are the facts»

At least

four of the people who testified# four of the children# these
are 13# 14# 15-year-old children# had to receive medical
treatment»
On© of them# Jamas Ingraham, suffered a severe hema­
toma»

Ha v/as unable to sit down for three weeks»

Another#

Roosevelt Andrews# lost the use of his hand and had to seek
medical attention. Another one had a lump on. his 'forehead from
the paddle# which had to be lanced, surgically treated, and
left a scar»

Another# Daniel Lee# —

QUESTION: As I understand it# the testimony of these
boys was all uncontradicted.
HR. RGGOW s

Yes# it was# Mr. Justice Stave ns.

QUESTION: Well# does the record explain why the
people who administered the discipline did not testify?
MR. ROGOWs

Because there was a 41(b) dismissal

under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure? in effect# a motion

12
for a directed verdict at th© end of the plaintiffs' case was
granted.
QUESTIONS

I S6®,

MR. ROGOV?; And. so the case was resolved at that
point in the district court.
Daniel Lee fractured his hand* and had a dislocated
knuckle* which the district court looked at and in the record
saw that there was

a

scar even still left from that.

People missed school. Some of the descriptions that
are involved in this record are unique* we think* in the annals
of punishment in the educational setting.

Children hollering*

crying* praying* screaming; and yet still being punished.

And

one* Rodney Williams* said that he was begging for mercy as he
was hit with the paddle* and then he was hit with a belt and*
in his words* "and tears was coming out of me".
There were repeated blows* fifty blows to one student
for allegedly making an obscene telephone call.

There were --

QUESTION: Granted all this* Professor* does the Eighth
Amendment still apply?
MR. ROGOV?s

It applies.

QUESTION5 Well now* there are three parts to the
Eighth Amendment* aren't there?

Excessive bail and fines* both

of which are in the criminal context.
MR. ROGOV?:

Yes* they are.

QUESTION: And you're stating that cruel and unusual

13
punishment necessarily goes beyond the criminal context?
MR. ROGOW; Because the focus is upon the punishment*
and merely* as I said before* Hr. Justice Blackmun, -QUESTIONi Do you think the Founders felt that when
they formulated the Eighth Amendment?
MR. ROGGW:

Xfc8s hard for me to state what exactly

the Founders felt, but I believe that they must have thought
that punishment imposed by the government cannot

be so severe

and so excessive that it weald amount to the kind of violations
of human dignity which they saw occurring

in the past, in

England and on the Continent.
QUESTIONs

Is there a concept of custody that attends

your definition of punishment under the Eighth Amendment?
That is, must the person inflicting the punishment, presumably
on behalf of the government, have the person in some sort of
custody where, in effect, he can't get away?
HR. ROGOW:

Not

it is not necessary, to my

analysis of the Eighth amendment; but there is, in some limited
way, that custody concept even here, in a public school setting.
QUESTION:

But your *—■ it's not necessary to your

MR. ROGOW:

No, I don't tie it to custody.

QUESTION:

Well, what if one's superior in the local

analysis?

government office simply pistol*"whipped him?

So there would be

ecu-■' anc vc uavwC if p. aformoi by a jailer on an inmate — would

14

that be a cruel and unusual punishment?
MR. ROGOW:

If it were done for the purpose of

punishment, perhaps it could reach to that ~~ iso the level of
an Eighth Amendment violation»
QUESTION:

What if the Clerk would walk out

QUESTION:

Say in one of our conferences on© of -us

MR. ROGOW:

I don’t think that kind of force -~

QUESTION: Why not?
MR. ROGOW:

— does not ris© to the excessive

QUESTION: Why not?
MR. ROGOW:

— to the excessive punishment that we’re

talking about.
QUESTION:

We* re agents of the federal government,

run federal business.
MR. ROGOW: But you are not punishing someone under
authority given to you by federal lax-? or by State 1®-? in -this
case.
QUESTION: Well, the authority is to confer, and
sometimes the conferences can get quite heated.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOW.:
QUESTION:

That's also to try to get.this degree.
But, the authority is to confer, —
There is provocation

15

ILaughtera 3
MR. ROGOW:

The authority is to confer, Mr. Justice

Stewart, but the authority is not to punish.

And in the case

that we’re talking about, the authority that a school master
has is to punish.

When ha exceeds that authority, then ~ in

such a severe and excessive way, then on© gets over into an
Sightii Amendment, violation.
QUESTION:

Counsel, what do you do about the loco

parentis argument, is that gone?
MR, ROGOWi

No, it is not gone.

There are several things that I do with that, Mr.
Justice Marshall,
The first is to explain it in its historical concept.
First of all, it was the product of a voluntary school or
educational system., where parents could choose to send their
children or not send their children to school.
situation today,

That is not the

children must be sent to school.

And, -fco soma

extent, that ties in with the custody notion that is involved
here,
tod, secondly, if parents had some way, at least, to
say, "I withdraw ray* -•* this assumed delegation to a teacher,
then perhaps one could say, well, there may not need to be a
hearing before the punishment is imposed, because the parent
has already given their authority to do it..
But there cannot b® that withdrawal, the way the law

16
stands today.
to school.

So a parent is committed to sending his children

He has no say# or sh© has no say about what kind

of punishment is inflicted in -that school. And we submit that
the loco parentis argument does not permit, because there has

been this assumed delegation, excessive beatings, and it doesn't
permit a beating without an opportunity for a hearing.

QUESTIONS

Are you comparing this to military

service under the draft, for example? And would you say there,
that a person in the military service, who was required, for
some disciplinary reason, to stand up far 48 hours or some such
thing, would be within the reach of the Eighth Amendment?

MR. EOGOWs

The person could be.

If the punishment

was excessive.
QUESTION;

Well, I assume — make it 96 hours, and

certainly that would be excessive, would it not?
MR. ROGOWs
of the fact.

It — as I say, it depends upon the facts

It would seam to ms that the 96 hours of standing

would be excessive punishment, and is a punishment the Eighth

Amendment -QUESTION:

If that were ordered by a superior

officer, and circumstances were that h© had to comply, then
you say the Eighth Amendment would be invoked?
MR. ROGOW:

It could be invoked, yes, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION; Well — go ahead.

17

QUESTION;
complaint*

Mr. Rogovs, you ask for damages in your

This is a Florida case, isn’t it?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION;

Yes , it is , Mr. Justice Brennan.
Is there any possibility -- are there other

tort remedies under Florida law for this kind of thing?
MR. ROGOW;

Yes , there are.

The due process right to b© heard, which we argue,
is not tied at all to the Eighth Amendment argument.

We are

not saying one could justify sever© and excessive beatings
by giving a hearing before on© administers those kinds of
beatings. What we are saying is, when one is beaten with an
instrument designed to cause bodily injury, that beating
infringes upon liberty rights. The liberty rights —
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOW;

Do you mean a slap?
No, I do not mean a si tip, Mr. Justice

Brennan.
QUESTION;

Well, I just mean to say that a slap might

No, it would not.

Or a karate chop would not b©?
If the karate —

[Laughter. ]
MR. ROGOW;

I see situations in which the hands can

18
be used as instruments to do as much danger as a paddle, for
instance in this case»
QUESTION:
and pain:

Well, is the distinction between injury

Would you make any distinction there?
MR. ROGOW:

I would not focus on injury or pain, I

would focus on punishment, Mr. Chief Justice.

I don’t want to

have to measure aftewards whether or not there is an entitlement
to a hearing.
What vre are saying is when on© is beaten by an
instrument, there is a right to a hearing.
I must, add that I am limiting this case to the facts
of this case.

This case deals with an instrument, it doesn't

deal with karate chops, it doesn't involve that kind of
situation.
QUESTION:

I wouldn’t go with the limitation you’re
Would you like to be * gently'8* slapped

[Laughter. ]
MR. ROGOW:

No, I would not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean it’s — I don't think you

should limit it to that.
If you want to, go right ahead.
QUESTION:

But your Fourteenth Amendment argument is

tied to punishment.
MR. ROGOW:

Punishment

19
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOV/;

Ju31 as your Eighth Amendment argument is.
Punishment,

Yes.

Yes.

Done under

color of State law.
QUESTION;

And any difference in definition' of

punishment for your Fourteenth Amendment argument than for a
punishment in your Eighth Amendment argument?
MR. ROGOV/:

Certainly.

Because the Eighth Amendment

argument is severe and excessive punishment.

The Fourteenth

Amendment due process argument is punishment which is the
punishment which is permissible, even under Florida law;
corporal punishment, reasonable corporal punishment.
QUESTION;

In other words,

five slaps with a ruler

on the hand could still require a hearing before it could be
administered?
MR. ROGOV/;

Yes.

Yes, it would.

And let me say this, that under Florida law the
statutes and the School Board regulations, they already require
some consultation with the principal prior to trie administration
of corporal punishment, that kind of corporal punishment.
Sc the hearing that we8 re addng for would not be any
intrusion, really, into the public school workings on a daily
basis.

We submit, that there must be a minimal opportunity for

a hearing, something similar to Goss vs, Lcpez, and there must
to. a decision as to whether or not the punishment should be

by a neutral and detached person.

20

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuity in.
absolutely precluding Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment
relief, it seems to us, goes much too far.
I'll reserve the rest of my time for tomorrow morning
in rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.
We have about eight minutes, I think we'll let you
go ahead, Mr. Howard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK A. HOWARD, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HOWARD;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The Court is being asked in this case to take two
long further steps into still another araa of school discipline,
public s chool dis cipline.
The Court is being asked to expand the bounds of the
Eighth Amendment as they have bean understood, at least under
the decisions of this Court, to provide federal actions whenever
a student or a student's parent perceives that a punishment
has been immoderate or unacceptable to the student or the
parent.
And, secondly, the Court is being asked to mandate
constitutional due process procedures in every case of
corporal punishment by extension of the rule that the Court
adopted in Goss vs. Lopez, providing •- for due process in

21
suspension cases up to ten days.
We see the case as an opportunity,, first, for the
Court to clarify and to reaffirm the scope of the Eighth
Amendment as being limited to punishments inflicted either as a
consequences of or collateral to the criminal process? and,
secondly, if not to overrule Goas vs. Lopez, at least to confine
it within its rationale, and not to open that rule to threaten
the discretion of educators in still more and more and -more
day-to-day decisions which are being made throughout the nation
in the schools.
QUESTION:
said in Strickland?

How do you square that with what the Court
That is, if the Court were now to say

that the same general procedures provided for in the Strickland
Y\ Wood case were to apply here, would that be any extension
of — or would you regard that as an extension of the law?
MR. HOWARD:

Well, I would see the Wood vs0 Strick-

land case as an additional reason for the Court not to take

<SSeXOW»"«BaB»

yet another step in the due process procedural field, because
QUESTION: Would that be another step, or would it be
the same step applied to a different context?
I think it would b@ another step, Mr. Chief Justice.
I am not recalling the specific facts of Wood_ys« Sfcrickland
now.

As I recall it, it was a suspension case.

MR. HOWARD:

QUESTION:

Well, we’re dealing, I suppose, if I

understand you, with the procedural due process aspect of this
case.

But neither Goss nor Strickland involved any Eighth

Amendment issue at all.
MR. HOWARD;

That’s true, sir.

Yes.

But I agree with counsel, that we have two separate —
QUESTION;
MR. HOWARD;
QUESTION;

Yes.
~~ issues here.

And -*■

Mr. Howard, State or federal in Florida,

are there any restrictions on corporal punishment in the school
system?
MR. HOWARD;

At the time -the case arose, Mr. Justice,

the statute in Florida was a very short section, which, by
negative implication, authorised corporal punishment in defining
the authority of the teacher.
Since that time, in fact just this year, the State

23

Legislature5; has enacted a fairly comprehensive set of laws
dealing with student conduct, and it now extensively defines
corporal punishment, and provides procedures for how it is to
be administered.
QUESTION; But, at the time — this record, as I read
it, was a little bit horrible, and it stands uncontradicted,
and there is nothing for us

far me to do but to view it,

that that's possible under Florida law.
HP. HOWARD:

I would disagree, Mr. Justice,

respectfully, that, with your characterisation of the record,
I disagree with ~-~
QUESTIONs

But that little fellow's hand, I think that

something happened to his hand.
MR. HOWARD:

Well, Mr. Justice, in considering -the

phrase, under any definition, "cruel and unusual", we have,
in this case, I submit, a few incidents of immoderate and even
severe, if you will, punishment.

But in the context of what

the case sought to establish, and the size and variety of the
school system, and the fact that, most of the punishments which
the record reflects were trivial, I submit to you that the
evidence did not come anywhere near showing cruel and unusual
punishment, however you may choose to define that ~
QUESTION: But at that time the teacher could do
whatever he wanted.
MR. HOWARD:

No, sir, he could not, under the

24
QUESTION2 Well, I asked you what were the restrictions»
MR» HOWARD:

Well, there was a Dade Comity' School

Board policy in effect at the tine, which provided that the
teachers must consult with the principal before corporal punish-”
inant could be administered? that the punishment should take
place in -the presence of another adult? the student should be
informed of the reasons for the punishment, and what file
misconduct was»
QUESTION: Well, what was the punishment?
There were no restrictions on the punishment»

Could

he be paddled 125 times?
MR» HOWARD: There were no explicit restrictions ~
QUESTION: That's what I mean, yes»
MR. HOWARD;

*—> except statements that it must be

— it must net exceed reasonable, moderate bounds —
QUESTION:
MR. HOWARD:

I see.
— which has been the common law

definition, as I understand it.
The best test of the record, I might say, Mr. Justice,
is that the district judge who was the man, the court, most in
a position to assess the facts, dismissed this case at the close
of the plaintiffs* evidence, and used the plaintiffs' test.
He accepted the i standard. that the Eighth Amendment did apply,
and found that the facts did not rise to that level.
Coming then to the Eighth Amendment issue, the issue,

25

as we see it, is simply whether or not the amendment applies
at all.

The Fifth Circuit in this case, the ea banc court,

held that it did not, and gave some careful analysis to the
history and the rationale of the Eighth Amendment.
One Circuit disagrees, the Eighth Circuit has held, in
a case that went only on the pleadings, that the Eighth
Amendment can apply. There was no analysis, no reasoning to
support the conclusion.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Howard, suppose there were two inmates

in a mental institution, on© was there because of a criminal
commitment, the other on® was there because of a civil commit*»
meat# in tht. same

institution.

Would the Eighth Amendment

apply fco one and not fco the other?
MR. HOWARD:
Bishop case

'

My. Jus'tics, I’m aware of the Jack .son vs.
I would say, first, with respect, that

this Court has never gone so far as to say that punishment,
even fco prisoners, violates tea Eighth Amendment.
^

rev, I must say that. I don't have a lot of doubt what

the outcome of that issue might be,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will pick up there

at ten Clclock tomorrow morning.
[Whereupon, at 3 s 00 p.m., the Court was recessed, to
reconvene at 10*00 a.m., Wednesday, November 3, 1976.]
