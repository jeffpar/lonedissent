MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1126, TWA against Hardison and 75-1385, Machinists
Union against Hardison.
Mr. Feldmiller, I think you may proceed now0
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. FELDMILLER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.
MR. FELDMILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice^ iind

may it please the Court:
This case, which is here on certiorari to the
Eighth Circuit, involves twc general issues:
First, the extent of the protection under fchs
establishment clause, in so far as whether a person can, in
effect, bo

taxed or forced to spend money or be deprived of

work coverage or nondiscriminatory work rules so that another
may practice his religion.
Second, the proper application of two provisions of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in the context of Rule 52(a)'s
clearly erroneous requirement.
The first provision under the Civil Rights Act is
the 1972 congressional amendment. Section 701(j), and its fore­
runner, the 1967 EEOC guideline, both of which define
religion and require an employer to reasonably accommodate all
aspects of his employee’s religious observance and practice,
as- well as beliefs.

And I emphasise all beliefs.

5
Unless that employer can demonstrate an undue
hardship.
The second provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
is Section 703(h). and that declares that "it shall not be an,
unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different;
terms of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit
.system, provided that such differences are not the result of
an intention to dis criminate."
And, incidentally, there is no evidence in the record
of any intention to discriminate.
After a full-blown evidentiary hearing, in which
seven witnesses testified, -the district court dismissed Mr.
Hardison’s religious discrimination claim and entered its
findings of fact that TWA had reasonably accommodated
Hardison and that any further accommodation would have
constituted an undue hardship.

Judge Oliver found that many

of the stipulated facts were irrelevant, and he referenced all
of his findings to the -transcript testimony of the live
witnesses, end he stated that, he was wimpressed with the men
who were on the line handling the problem.H
The Eighth Circuit disagreed and decreed that. Judge
Oliver's findings of fact were clearly erroneous.
Now, the basic facts of this matter can be succinctly
and summarily stated.

Hardison was employed at TWA's major

overhaul bass in Kansas City, Missouri.

That base operates

6

24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

And at the time he was

employed, in 1967, Hardison indicated that he would work
shifts, including weekends.

And upon his employment, he became

a union member, and he functioned in accordance with the bona
fide seniority rights that govern all job assignments under
tlie applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Now, thereafter, in the spring of 1968, Hardison
began studying the religion known as the Worldwide Church of
God, and in April he wrote his supervisor, Mr. Everett
Kussman, and he stated that h® wsnted special time off from
Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, because he sincerely
believed that that was the Sabbath under his new religion.
Mr. Kussman immediately initiated a meeting with Mr.
Hardison, to talk about -tills matter.

Kussman agreed to

excused time off for seven religious holidays which Mr.
Hardison had, non© of which were the same as the contract.ueil
holidays under the collective bargaining agreement.
Mr. Kussman also agreed to the union seeking swap©
for days off, and an attempt to find another job.

The report

was mads to Mr. Kussman that Mr„ Hardison's day-off requirements
were too difficult to handle.
QUESTION: To find another job with the same employer?
MR. FELDMILLER:

Yes, with the same employer.

Thank you.
Hardison was generally able to avoid Saturday work

7
from April, the tires he first met with Mr. Kussman, through
March of 1969, or up to March of 1969.

He did, in that interim,

work some voluntary overtime work, on his Sabbath®
Now, after a second meeting in September of IS68,
between Hardison, Kussman and the; union steward, Hardison was
still able to avoid the Saturday work and he was fully
accommodated in his religious practices, because Mr® Kussman
had been able to agree with the union consent that, he could
have his seven special holidays off.
However, in December of 1968, Hardison voluntarily
transferred to a different shift in a different building,
which "was governed by different seniority requirements and
seniority lists.
At that time he left the security of being halfway
up the ladder in seniority to a position where he was second
from the bottom.

When he made this transfer,'he knew that he

could expect some work on a Saturday in the event of a
vacation problem or the employee junior to him. might be ill
or something of that nature®
And at the time — well, he had no Saturday work
up to March of 1969® At that time, Mr. Kussman, the TWA
Supervisor, noticed a schedule change had been made which would
require Hardison to work starting Saturdays on March 8th,
Mr. Kussman therefore initiated a meeting with Mr,
Hardison and brought in the union steward, Mr® Tinder, to

8

see what: roles or aspects of accommodation could be made»
Mr. Kussman once again agreed to waive the seniority obliga­
tions upon TWA under the collective bargaining agreement,
but the union steward did not believe that that could be done,
and refused to do so.
Mr. Hardison offered to work six days a week, and
that was acceptable to TWA, but it was unacceptable to the
union because of the 40-hour work rule, that any work over
40 hours was subject to the overtime bidding rights of all other
employees.
The aspect of whether or not Hardison may have been
able to work four days a week may well have been discussed at
this meeting.

Mr. Kussman did not believe that he could

allow Mr. Hardison to have a four-day workweek, because he
needed people to work in TWA8s continuous operation requirements,
he was the only person scheduled to work on the job on
Satursdays after March 8th, and this was a job that had to be
filled in order to respond to any emergencies which might
occur at the overhaul base.
Mr. Hardison was not satisfied with the results of
the March 8th, 1969, meeting, but he did not file a grievance,
although he knew he could do so.
QUESTION;

Mr. Feldmiller, before you leave that;

meeting —
MR. FELDMILLER;

Yes, sir.

9
' QUESTION:

— was there discussion at

that meeting

of a possible swap?
MR. FELDMILLER:

Yes# the re was a discussion of

general swaps# a change of jobs# perhaps him going back to his
earlier section.
QUESTION:
'wasn't feasible?

would you explain to me why the swap

And the reason I ask the question is that

apparently it must have been assumed# when the company
indicated willingness to consider giving him his special
holidays# that there would probably be trades# why couldn't
there have been a swap here?
MR. FELDMILLER:

Well# the basic difference between

the holiday situation# the seven-holiday situation, and the
swap on the Saturday is governed by the realities# I thinke
of the situation.
For example# TWA had a contractual obligation that
it would work a minimal overtime or minimal weekend force tit
its overhaul base on. the weekends.

And also the people with

the high seniority just preferred not to work on Saturdays.
So we had a very limited number of people that could be -that were realistically available for TWA at this time.
QUESTION:
Rainer

Well# weren’t there — I think Judge

says there are about 20G people that could have done

the work.
MR. FELDMILLER:

There may have been more than 200

10

people who could have done the work, but none of those people
were available within the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement* because the collective! bar-gaining agreement did
not provide for just mere swaps between employees.
QUESTION: Did it prohibit swaps?
MR® FELDMILLER:

Yes, sir»

Every time, Mr« Justice

Stevans, 'there was an opening in a job, that opening had to be
subject to -the bidding rights of all other employees®
QUESTION: Well, I understand it, but why couldn’t
supposing he had said, ”1sv© got & friend that will fill in
for me", and then the answer would have been, "Well, he can't
unless you open the job for bidding®"
MR® FELDMILLER:

That's right.

QUESTION: Well, why couldn't that have been done?
MR® FELDMILLER:

TWA was willing to do that., and

the union was willing to do that, but apparently the union
did not. believe that the bidding would have been available,
or would have rendered Hardison any relief.

There were no

jobs available within tine seniority framework at that time®
QUESTION: Well, what happens in the company, say
somebody comas in and says, "I've got to go to the dentist
next Friday, can I trade with somebody"? is there any way to
handle a problem like that?
MR® FELDMILLER:
QUESTION:

There is not®

People just never switch at TWA?

11
MR. FELDMILLER;

Seniority in this situation? and

this distinguishes the case from many of the other cases
that have been decided? under the terms of this seniority
agreement? there were no situations —
QUESTION:

What provision in the collective bargain­

ing agreement forecloses a swap?
MR. FELDMILLER:

That would be the provision that

all jobs? all shift assignments are governed by the seniority
rights of ail employees.
QUESTION:

That would appear in *—

If I understand it? all that means is

that if you find a candidate for a swap before it can be
effectuated you’ve got to say? "Does anybody with more
seniority want to do it?"
MR, FELDMILLER:

That’s right,

QUESTION: But why does that prohibit trying to do it?
MR. FELDMILLER: Well? I don’t think — I don't, think
that that would

that it was not tried in the sense that

TWA authorized that to be done.

It is the union steward

that does this? the union steward maintains the seniority list?
and he is the one that goes through the list? makes the
contacto- to fill the jobs.

Our hands were really tied in

going out to the employees.

If we did? we would be subject,

to the union understandably saying that perhaps you’re out
there trying to coerce volunteers, when? in fact? we would not
be doing that.

It could lead to very substantial problems

12

with the union relationship,
We were very willing for that to b© done, we agreed
that it could be done»

And the union did not believe that it

was proper in this case to do.
I don’t knew their exact reasons.

Mr. Rafcner might

b© able to explicate further on those.
At any event, when Judge Oliver saw the witnesses and
when he rendered his decision, he took into account the fact
that TWA had to consider the rights of other employees.

The

problems of employee morale and grievance problems in the
event that TWA went further without union consent.
He also took into account that all religious beliefs ,
it would be burdensome upon the employer to have to take into
account all religious beliefs of all employees.

H© thought

that seniority was an important right, and that under Section
70 3(h) , if that was not controlling it at least indicated the
congressional intent to protect bona fide seniority rights
and in fact Judge Oliver found that it was coincidental that
the seniority provision in this case acted to in any way
hamper Hr, Hardison’s ability to work.
QUESTION:

Mr. Feldmiller.

MR. FELDMILLER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONs Getting back again to the factual frame­
work of this case, you told us that “this place of employment
operates 365 days a year.

13
MRo FELDMILLERs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

That,- of course, includes Sundays, and, as

we both knew, most people observes the Sabbath on Sunday.
MR. FELDMILLERs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: What provision has the company and/or the
union made, if any, to accommodate the religious views of -those
who observe the Sabbath on Sunday?
MR. FELDMILLERs

The people who would observe the

Sabbath on Sunday, Mr. Justice Brennan, would have been treated
exactly like Mr. Hardison was.

It would have been extremely

difficult, I -think in our society, that if the people who do
worship on Sunday wanted off, it would

be very difficult for

a comp may like TWA, that has to operate 24 hours a day, to
serve the public and to fulfill its functions, to continue
to operate.
QUESTION: Does the record show anything on this
subject?
MR. FELDMILLERs
QUESTION:

No, it does not, except —

Of accommodation of those employees who

observe the Sabbath on Sunday?
MR. FELDMILLBR:
QUESTION:

No, it does not.

No ~

MRo FELDMILLERs

Except the fact that they would

have been treated exactly the same.

That is net in the record,

but they would have been treated exactly the same as Mr.

14
Hardison»
QUESTIONS

But the record just contains nothing on

this subject?
MR. FELDMILER:

No.

We believe that the Court of Appeals violated Rule
52(a) and tried the matter de novo»

V7© think that this is an

important consideration in this case. because the Court of
Appeals really misconstrued the record# we believe# in
assuming and relegating TWA the role of a Pontius Pilc.te.
We think that the record is clear that Mr. Kussman die his
very best# as an individual and as a person# not just because
it was mandated by law# but he did his best to go in there and
work it out with Mr. Hardison# at the same time protect his
relationship with the union that he has to work with on a dayin/day-out basis.
We also think that the Court of Appeals made some
serious factual mistakes.
the full record.

For one thing# it said it reviewed

In fact# it did not do that# because the

full record was not filed in the Court of Appeals. The full
record now is on file at this Court.

The only record that the

Court of Appeals had was the trial appendix. And while that
is a full appendix and relatively full# they

still did not

have fc® entire record to review in purporting to reverse
Judge Oliver’s findings as clearly erroneous.
QUESTION: Wall# did it have all of the evidence and

15

all of the sfcipulations?
MRo FELDMXLLERs

Yes,

It did not have all of the

evidence, it had all of the stipulations which —- many of which,
— Judge Oliver found to be irrelevant, and it had a great deal
of the testimony, it was a very thorough
QUESTION

%

Everything that the parties thought the

Court needed to pass on the case,.
MR» FELDMILLER:

Thera were some things, according

to the Federal Rules, that were not placed in the record, that
were important; but they did not call upon «—
QUESTION:

Rut nobody filed them with the Court of

Appeals.
MR. FELDMII.LER:

— they did not call upon, the

Court of Appeals nor the parties, called upon the district
court to apparently send up the rest of the record.
We were under th© impression that the entire record
was submitted, and we were so informed by the district court
and th© Court of Appeals Clerk, but when I got the record for
this Court, die Court of Appeals called me and said, "We're
sorry, Mr. Feldmiller, we made an earlier mistake and we
did not have the entire record."
Thank you.

AFTERNOON SESSION
[IsOO p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Ratner, you may

proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MO2ART G. RATNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IAM&AW
MR. RATNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
T should first 1

to janwsr Mr. Justice Stevens’

question concerning why these jobs couldn’t have been put up
for bid.
They couldn’t have been put up for bid because
neither party to the potential swap asked that his job be
put up for bid.

Neither was willing to vacate his job.

Hardison testified at pages 83 and 84 of the Appendix that
he knew all about the procedure, it was perfectly possible for
him to get into that midnight shaft where he wouldn't have to
work on his Sabbath by bidding. But that job was not open,
because the fallow on the midnight shift hadn’t indicated any
willingness whatever to leave it.

In fact, Hardison said he

had no idea whether the fellow would be even willing to swap.
There had been no application by that man to leave
his job, nor had there been one by Hardison.
triggers the bidding, is the job vacancy.
that there was no job vacancy.

That’s what

The record is clear

One could have been created,

17
had either one of these two employees chosen to create one,
by telling the company they want to leave it.

Neither of them

did.
QUESTION;

Hr. Ratner,,

didn't that testimony relate

to more or less permanent exchange of jobs as opposed to, ”1
can't work this Friday, is there somebody I car, trade with?”
MR. RATNER;

The difference is between a "I can't

work this Friday", which is treated as an emergency situation
and which sometimes is worked out, arid the recurrent cr
permanent situation, which is clciar mu3t be handled by the
bidding procedure.
There is testimony that occasionally, through the
Union Relief Committee, things were worked out.

But there

is no testimony that in any of those situations the seniority
rights of any intervening employe!®

were impaired.

In short,

even a swap, so far as this record shows, could not have been
accomplished if that swap had been over the objection of
soma other employee who would have preferred to work that
shift.
Now, here you had as many

as 200 potential appli­

cants for tills job, and it was obviously impossible for a
continued period, here it was a minimum of -three weeks and
basically it was far more than that, because Hardison was a
permanent convert, presumably, to this religion, he would
constantly, in any job that he had where he remained the senior

18

man, corns into these situations where he would'.be unwilling to
perform, to meet the job requirements of that job, which was
attendance at work on his scheduled workday,,
The company treated it, in so far as the record shows,
nondiscriminatorily treated it as a completely different
situation in a one-day swap. The holidays they were willing to
do.

They did.

Nobody’s seniority rights were impaired.

QUESTION :

Does the record tell us how they were

going to solve the holiday problem?
MR. RATTIER: The record does not tell us how they
were going to solve the holiday problem, except that they did
solve the holiday problem — well, in a sense, it tells us„
It -tells us that he was going to have to be available for work
on the Christian holidays.

He might or might not have had a

chance to do, or been obliged to come in and work those
holidays, depending on whether the people senior to him in
seniority wanted the chance to work those holidays,
QUESTION:
MR. RATHER:
QUESTION:

I thought it was a volunteer situation.
I’m sorry?
Isn't it a volunteer situation on the

holidays?
MR. RATNER:
QUESTION:

Mo.
That somebody voluntarily gave up, or was

persuaded to?
MR. RATNER:

Well, they were persuaded or induced by

19

extra payments, to come in and work on the holiday„

He would

have gotten extra pay for working on the holiday„
QUESTION:

Yes „

Well,, what would happen if two

men, one wants Saturday and one vrants Sunday, and they agree
that any time it comes up, "we'll switch"?
MR. RATNER:

Mof that call't be done, you're violating

tlie seniority rights of all the people with seniority over
both of the swappers .
QUESTION:
MR. RATHER:

Righto I thought it was too simple0
To avoid the necessity of passing on

the
QUESTION:

Let me follow up with one other question.

there»
MR. RATNERs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
If someone senior objected to that, then

it would mean you just swap with somebody else, wouldn't it?
MR. RATNERs

No, it wouldn't be.

If somebody

objected to that, that somebody would bid into that job, and
Hardison, if he had bid out. of it, would be out of work; he
would have no job.

There was no place for him to go.

Unless he had the seniority to teJce over the job of the man
who took his job, which he didn't have-, and wouldn't have,
because he was low man on the totem pole.
And it's not his job to swap, ha doesn't own that
job

20

QUESTION: So if a fellow gets a toothache and has
to go to the dentist, it's got to be an emergency is what
you're saying?
MR. RATHER:

Ho.

The fellow who's got a toothache

and has to go to
QUESTION:
MR. RATHER:

There's no way to solve it.
— the dentist is probably going to

get sick leave.
QUESTION:
MR. RATHER:

I see.
There is probably that kind of

emergency, not. from choice.
QUESTIOH:

And if a cousin comes in from out of

town, once in a long time, wants to see him that one day
and trade with somebody, he just can't do that?
MR. RATHER:

Your Honor, the one day temporary

situation is handled intelligently, sensibly, regularly in
this plant, it was handled for Hardison.

This man made a

*

permanent conversion to a religion that required him to be
off every Saturday.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the problem would only arise

when somebody else in the department went on vacation.

His

regular -- he didn’t have the problem on his own regular
assignment, did he?
MR. RATHER;

Well, a three-week period of time is

more than the company properly felt could be treated as an

21
emergency under the collective bargaining agreement» They
were righto That's the way the agreement, properly construed,
is o
QUESTION: Well, do you think, Mr. Ratine r, that the
statute tliat the Court of Appeals relied on here permits no
adjustment whatever of rights under the collective bargaining
agreement?
MR. RATNER:

Well, you mean requires obliteration

of rights under a collective bargaining agreement?
QUESTION:

No, not —

MR. RATHER:

Indeed, I think that the way the

Court of Appeals construed it, it does sc require, and I
think that’s what

if the Court so construes it, that's

what makes the statute a violation of the establishment clause.
That's why I suggest the Court should not so construe it.
QUESTION: But your response to questions by Justice
Stevens and Justice Marshall have been primarily, it seems to
ne, that there was just no way to do this under the collective
b argaining agreement.
MR. RATNER:
QUESTION:

Right.
As if that were a total and definitive

answer in this context.
MR. RATNER:

It is a total and definitive answer

in this context to the questions that I understood Mr. Justice
Stevens to be asking, which was:

was there a way to

22

accommodate this man. by swapping shifts which would not have
violated the collective bargaining agreement?
answer is no.

To which my

If there is no such way, either without,

obliterating rights under the collective bargaining agreement
or imposing costs upon the company, you confront — unless you
avoid it in the methods I'm about to discuss — you confront
squarely the establishment clause questions
statute on which the court below relied

does this

empower the govern­

ment to expropriate money from some people, money, property,
liberty from some, and give the benefits of that expropriation
to others in order to facilitate those others’ practice of
religion?
And, in addition, not only that, but does it allow
the government to do this on a discriminatory basis?

So that

only religious causes are benefitted by this as distinguished
from secular^

clauses?

I agree with Your Honor that if this company were
shown to have a practice of allowing people to take Saturdays
off during the football season, to go watch their sons play
football, that’s a good, legitimate secular reason.

But: if

the plaintiff had shown that they did that and refused to
allow Hardison to take Saturdays off because of his religious
needs, that would violate the statute, constitutionally
construed,
that xtfay®

And I urge Your Honors to construe the statute

23

So that the obligation that imposes is a nondiscriminatory obligation as between secular and religious
needs, instead of a discriminatory one.

Instead of a mandate

to discriminate in favor of religious practices and obser­
vances at 'the expense of employers and competing seniority
rights and liberties of other employees, it imposes a nondiscriminatory oblige.fcion to treat requests for absences or
for variances from uniform,, normal, legitimate work-related
work rules requiring attendance and job performance of all
alike equally# not discriminatorily.
QUESTION:

You say# then# that Congress could nor

by law provide that an employer had to adjust for a person
who was a member of a religion which prevented him from
working on Saturday, but — unless it also required such
adjustment for someone whose son was playing football or
basketball and couldn’t work on Saturday for -the same —
MRo RATNER:
our position*

I say that, Your Honor, yes, that’s

I say that if we come to that, if the Court

has to come to that, I see no escape from a holding that
such a statute violates the establishment clause, for the
reasons I’ve already stated.
One, it imposes a tax on the employ ex*, on the union,
and on the employees*

If any principle is clear under the

establishment clause, it is that government shall impose no
tax, however small, to support religious activities.

And it’s

24
perfectly obvious that the tax that.5s being imposed on the
employer is for no purpose other than fco support Hardison's
adherence to his religion» or religious activities,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr, Ratner» let me just finish

the thought and then I will leave the point,
I was trying to posit a case that would be cost-free»
that it would be like a case in which one man normally works
on Saturday,, and he says "I'd like to have Saturday off to
watch my son play football» and T. have a friend over here who
wants Sunday off to see the Redskins» and we want fco trade,"
And you're telling me» as I understand it» the collective
bargaining structure is such that that could not be dene in
this corap any?
HR, RATTIER:

Yes» Your Honor. That's what I’m

telling you,
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It cannot be done if it conflicts v/ith

the seniority rights of someone who complains?
MR. RATHER:

That» as I understand — of someone

what?
QUESTION:
MR. RATHER:

Of someone who complains about it.
Well» the: union is there fco see fco it

that the seniority rights of nobody in the plant are taken
away v from them» whether Urey complain about it or not.

They

are to be. given the opportunity fco exercise their rights under

25

•that agreement.

If a union doesn't do that, it's not performing

its duty of fair representations

That's what it's there for,

to see to it that nobody else' s rights are impaired.
Kov/, I suggest to Your Honors that the nondiscrimin­
atory construction of the statute that I have suggested
comports with the entire thrust of Titia VII, and that a
contrary construction defeats it.
The purpose of Title VII is to eliminate discrimina­
tion on forbidden grounds, as the term "discrimination" is
generally understood and as defined in Griggs ? to excuse
religious observers from compliance with neutral uniform
attendance and work performance and scheduling requirements
is to guarantee them superior not equal employment terms and
conditions, and thus to discriminate in their favor,
QUESTION:

But that's like what’s in the Robinson-

Patman Act conflicts with the Sherman Act, and yet they are
both in the antitrust section of the Code, They both have
been enacted by Congress, even if they do conflict,
MR. RATHER:

Well, it’s possible to read the

statute, this statute, as conflicting with the whole rest of
Title VII as compelling discrimination in the face of a
retention of 703<j) , which says you shall not prefer any
employees because of their, among other things, religion?
you shall r.ot give them a preference.

Of course, Congress

could have left that, it could have left 703 unchanged, it

26
could have left;, as it: did, 701(a) unchanged, which talks
only about discrimination»

It could have done that»

The point; is that I don't think this Court has to
say that that’s what Congress did»

It doesn’t have to, and

if it can possibly avoid it, it ought to»
I’n going to have to reserve the balance of my
time, Your Honor.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well.

Mr. Pickett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PICKETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PICKETTi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This cause is indeed a sad case, as is quoted in
the Appendix at page 36.

Mr. Hardison was willing to work

any arrangement of job, shifts, «assignment, any swaps, any
hours.

However, it v;as a sad case as the union decided in a

latter, because he simply put his job —- he put his religion
befor© his j ob.
The facts — before I address some questions' by
Mr. Justice Stewart as well as Mr. Justice Stevens
case show clearly TWA did absolutely nothing.

in this

We need not

even consider — but I most certainly won’t address that
question. — what did in fact TWA do in this case that was a
roesenable accommodation.

They would not allow Mr. Hardison

27
to work a four-day week 0

This would have been, some tiling that

would have been able to comply with the reasonable accommoda-»
tion provision? before you ever get to undue hardship, one
must do something, the case lav; cells us.
QUESTION %

If they allow Hardison, on religious

grounds, to v;ork a four-day week, can they deny a four-day
week to any other employe®?
MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

Deny a request for a four-day week?

The statute does not

*

No, not the —

MRo PICKETT:

Yes, they can.

Yes.

QUESTION: They can deny it to others?
MR. PICKETT:

Yes, that is correct.

If, in fact,

the law, which is the reasonable accommodation provision,
which was the regulation promulgated under the '64 Act, was
implemented because 'th© EEOC found — this was the second
statute, there was a *66 and a *57 — to in fact implement
the provisions of Title VII, having to do with religion,
which was held constitutional as to religion in Griggs, then,
yes, they can if, in fact, the person who requests an
accommodation, which Mr. Hardison, I submit — the facts are
clear in this case —* not only notified TWA quite a great
deal ahead of time, but accommodated himself until the March
situation

Then, in that case, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, they

28

should -treat Mr. Hardison according to the statute.
Now, how is that?
reasonably.

Not preferentially, it5s

It is a reason situation.

Less burden, I might

suggest, than the business necessity doctrine which was given
credence in Griggs.

It is less of a burden on the part of
O’

the

employer to show in fact an undue hardship after he shows

a reasonable accommodation than it is simply to justify
something that may have a discriminatory effect, due to
religion.
QUESTION:

To put it another way, does the record

show that anyone else was given a four-day week?
MR® PICKETT:

The record is absent as to that,

because this was the; first time this had ever came up, Mr®
Justice Marshall, in TWA8s history, at Kansas City.
QUESTION:

Well, how ware they discriminated

against him?
MR. PICKETT:

How they discriminated against Mr®

Hardison, my client?
QUESTION:
MR. PICKETT:
in a number of ways.

Yes.
Well, they discriminated against him
TWA duty was to make a reasonable

accommodation, at least to attempt to do so, absent any
consideration of violation of the collective bargaining
agreement.
QUESTION; What did Hardison ask for?

What did he

29

ask TWA fco do?

That: TWA did not doQ

MR, PICKETT;

MR, PICKETT:

All right.

He was in a classification

at -that particular point where ho was going to be subjected
to .the provisions of -the collective bargaining agreement.
And I am saying that the collective bargaining agreement
does not have to even enter into the duty of -the employer.

dated, and the court so found — meaning the Court, of Appeals —
QUESTION:

Ha could have ignored the agreement?

ME. PICKETT:

By all means, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

The employer could have ignored the

it by the statute, yes.

I don’t think sc.

MR. PICKETT:

They had no objection to Mr. Hardison

TWA did have the objection.

Mr. Kussman told the union steward to try and

find some swaps.

question* Mr. Justice Marshall
QUESTION:

I heard what you said.

MR. PICKETT:

Mr. Justice Stevens asked ir his

question — the union relief committee was available in this
*

instance.

At the same day that this case was tried* there

was a Mr. Libby* whose wife was off because she was ill* he
was accommodated under the union relief committee.

Yes*

there was something that the TWA and the union could do.
Tliers is an agreement that must be reached between -the two.
QUESTION:

Well* did he ask the union relief

33

committee to do anything?
MR. PICKETT:

He didn’t even know of the uni on.

relief committee, the record reflects, Your Honor.
QUESTION; Well, it’s one tiling to give a person
relief for an emergency on one or two occasions, it’s another
thing to try to adjust a plant operation to no work on
Saturday at any tilt©, is it not?
MR. PICKETT:
facts in this case.
QUESTION:

Yes,but that was -- that: is not the

Reasonable accommodation -—
It is a fact that they made a number of

adjustments for him, did they not?
MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

No, absolutely not, Mr. Chief Justice.
Well, then I read a different record

from the one that you’re talking'about.
MR. PICKETT:

All right.

What did TWA do?

They

simply, after they received a letter from Mr. Hardison, called
him in and said, "All right, we will let you have your
holidays off, including Good Friday and Christmas, two
Christian holidays, if we can work it out —- we’ll let", you
have your holidays if you promise to cover those particular
holidays covered by the bargaining agreement."
That never came into play. There never was a conflict
as to whether or not they would or would not keep their word,
let’s say. So, therefore, that is not an accommodation as to
his Sabbath in this case.

34

What els© did they do?

They simply said, "We can’t

do anything because the union will not let us„6!

They could

have said — the collective bargaining agreement is not
sacrosanct, federal lav; in fact supersedes it — "Pile your
grievance, and it will be taken care of under the collective
bargaining machinery,,"

That's what they could have done.

They did not do anything to accommodate his Sabbath
observance.

They talked with the union about doing something,

but —
QUESTION:

Did they

ask to use the grievance

procedure?
MR. PICKETSt

He did not file a grievance.

After

the discharge hearing, in which the union told him "All we
can do is plead for leniency", Mr. Chief Justice? he did not
file a grievance, no.
What else could -QUESTIONj

Would you suggest that if all an employer

could do to make an accommodation would be to breach the
collective bargaining contract, would you think the statuta
would require that and take precedence over the contract?
MR. PICKETT;

Although w© don’t have to reach it

in this case, yes, I would.

Yes, I would.

Franks echoes

that also with the footnote, which I —
QUESTION:

And if the union

if -Hie employer goes

to the union to work out an accommodation, the union says,

35
"No, the collective bargaining contract requires something
else”, you would say the employer must nevertheless make the
accommodation?
MR. PICKETT:

I am saying yes, they mustf because

th© law directs that the employer must make a reasonable
accommodation e
QUESTIONs

And you don’t think that was the case

here?
MRa PICKETT:

Absolutely note

QUESTION: Do you think the union's position is
that it is the case here?
MR3 PICKETT:

No.

It is not» Because they did not

disagree with TWA —- with Mr. Hardison, saying he will work
four days off.

They said that will not violate the collective

bargaining agreement>
This case could have keen worked out, under the
provisions >f th© collective bargaining agreement.

If, in

fact, it couldn't, then th© collective bargaining agreement*s
provision should have given way.
TWA did net even try that.

TWA did nothing. They

threw up their hands and said "your, Mr. Hardison, suggestion"
— he said, '’1*11 work anything, 1*11 do anything, but I can't
work my Sabbath", and in fact they said, well, "your
suggestion, that's agreeable with you, and it will not
violate the collective bargaining agreement# might cast us

36

money, and we also have a problem with a hypothetical
futuristic deluge of grievances, and therefore we are not
going to do it.r
Now, what is reasonable?

That is the real question»

The particular statute is one which does not give a preference
to anyone, it in fact applies a neutral type of application»
In Griggs, this Court said that artificial barriers to 'chose
provisions, including religion, is what Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 is about»
The artificial barrier in this case is the collec­
tive bargaining agreement»
QUESTION:

Mr» Pickett, let me just ask —

MR» PICKETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens»

— one more question,

Is it your view

that the company or the .union, or both, could have
accommodated your client without imposing any additional cost
on the

company and without violating the

bargaining agreement?

collective

Or is one of 'those two things

essential?
MR» PICKETT:

That’s two questions.

They could

have accommodated ir.y client with a miniscule amount of cost
to TWA, by way —
QUESTION: What do you mean?

Do you mean overtime

and —
MR. PICKETT:

Supervisor covering, having somebody

37

stay afterwards,
QUESTION: All right,» But is it. essential that there
be coste assumed*, such as overtime, supervisor covering, or
one day the job not manned, or something like that?
MR. PICKETT;
QUESTION;

I cannot say for sure that would —
I think in principia it3s quite a

different cas©, if you assume that than if you assume a cost
figure.
MR. PICKETT:

I could not say that might not occur»

because in your hypothetical situation earlier in your
questions to Mr. Feldmiller, if in fact they would have posted
the job, then nobody might have bid on it, and, in fact, he
could have been able to work within the collective bargaining
agreement and there would have been no cost to anyone,,
QUESTION: But their answer to that, as I understand
it, is he didn't request that.
MR. PICKETT:

That is correct-

Because it was not

open, I also remember his responding to you in that regard.
QUESTION: Well, then, on th© basis of what he did,
is It correct that there was no way to oblige him without
either the company assuming same abnormal costs or violating
the agreement, one of those two?
MR. PICKETT:

That is correct, if abnormal costs

<

include supervisor
QUESTION:

Righfc.

MR» PICKETTs
QUESTION:

Something else# yes»

MR» PICKETT:

Then we have the emergency clause

here on this collective bargaining agreement»

What is more

of an emergency than — of course the problem, the first time
they ever had it — than an employee who is going to get
fired and it's his Sabbath observance?

They have two

provisions —
QUESTION:

That’s not what it says» The Sabbath

cortes up every weekend, and an emergency doesn’t»
MR» PICKETT:
QUESTION:

It wan an emergency

Isn’t that the difference?

MR. PICKETT:

Yes.

It was an emergency for ray

client, Mr. Justice Marshall, by all means.

Four weeks

QUESTION:

It wasn't his first Sabbath.

MR„ PICKETT:

He had had Sabbaths before»
MR» PICKETT:

MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

He had never been compelled to work»
He had had Sabbaths before, though»
Yes, he had, Mr. Justice Marshall»
So ifc wasn't air emergency»

He knew it

was coming»
MR. PICKETT:

No, that h® — well, he knew —*

39

QUESTION:
MR» PICKETTs

He dicin' fc know the Sabbath was coming?
He knew fch© Sabbath was coming# yes.

But he did not know that he was going to b© compelled# by
way of the collective bargaining agreement provision —- you
see# he worked for TWA sine© 1967.

He embraced

- studied the

faith in April of ‘68# embraced it in September of 1968# and
in fact TWA said# "We really think you've done a great job#
Mr. Hardison# for assisting us i.n attempting to comply* at
that time? of course# they had not even been called upon to
comply with anything.

Mr. Hardison had done it all by

exercising his seniority within the particular collective
bargaining agreement unit he was in.
From October '68 until 12/2/68 he had no problem# he
was working on the graveyard shift# he in fact had opted to
do that to make sure he would not cause his employer a problem.
He then — he was married# his wife wanted him home.
He did# for a secular reason he did in fact transfer to the
day shift.

He had no problem then.

He was working Monday

through Friday# got off before sundown? no problem there.

until the vacation situation did, when Bill Wyatt
went on vacation# thrust him into a position that he was
compelled to.
QUESTION:

Could he have challenged these —

raised these problems in the grievance procedure under the
collective bargaining contract?

40
MRo PICKETT:
could*

I would imagine he most certainly

He. didn’t know too much and he followed the union’s

lead as to what they suggested regarding leniency*

He didn’t

even say anything at that, particular — nor was there any
discussion on the part of the employer or the union of the
application of Title VII„

Although I believe it was in the

contract*
The switch of shifts, the swapping, the goir.g back
in tin© building, he was precluded in ©very way:

six months

you had to be in Building 1 before you could go back*
H© said, ’’I’ll go back»”
it takes six months„"

"Mo, you can't dc that,

He couldn’t swap because of the

collective bargaining procedure.
But, again, what’s important in this case as to
tine facts, and each fact situation of course is what dictates,
each case is separate.

In Rule 52 it was stipulated,

everything was stipulated in a very laborious stipulation,
as -to what the facts are in tills case.

The judge had. the

written correspondence, the facts; are clear*

It was sincere,

it was the first time in TWA’s history and, in fact, what
did the employer have to do?
QUESTION:

Well, he did have son© oral

he hoard

s&ven witnesses orally.

MR. PICKETT:
Absolutely.

That is correct.

That is correct.

So he had the benefit of not only the written

41
record but likewise the credibility.
Nov/, the Court, states — the Court of Appeals —
that they did rely heavily on Judge Oliver's findings of
fact.

They had a different conclusion of law.

He was clearly

erroneous in construing that the employer did discharge his
duty of reasonable accommodation when* in fact, the record
reflects they did nothing.

TWA did nothing affirmatively,

as to the claim on the part of the union and in the brief of
TWA —
QUESTION:

You did say TWA did nothing.

Who was

the man that wrote tie letter and said, "You come in and
let’s talk this over’ ?
MR. PICKETT:

Mr. Kussraan.

QUESTION: And he worked for whom?
MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:
MR. PICKETT:

TWA.
Thank you.
That was not an affirmative enough

statement, writing a letter, in my judgment, to — and Judge
Webster so found.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t it be more accurate to say TWA

didn’t do enough, than to say that TWA did nothing?

That’s

all I’m saying.
MR. PICKETT:

I understand.

Of any substance, they did nothing.
As to the constitutional argument, or tack-on

42
provision , the three-pronged test of Nyquist as to whether or
not it was a clearly legislative purpose, job security, that
it’s clear in my judgment that that was the reason, and in
fact in Griggs, it was so held that this was a constitutional
statute.

I don’t think there is any major question as to

whether or not it does in fact put forth a sectarian purpose.
Secondly, as to whether or not it had a primary
effect to inhibit or in fact advance religion, the individual
hers was the recipient of any incidental type of arrangements
that in fact had to be work out, not his religion. That
particular provision in the statute, and of course the
regulation was what applied at the time of the incident in this
case, 867, about reasonable accommodation, that is what is
important.

It applies to all religions, it doesn’t apply

just to Sabbatarians, it applies to all aspecte of practice,
and this is a practice case.
He did in fact practice his religion and lost his
job for it* The statute does not give the primary effect to
religion in any fashion.
As to fostering an excessive entanglement of
governmental aspects in the enforcement of it, we simply have
the duty on the employee to initiate the government action.
There is no auditing or any type of reports on the part of
the recipient of anything here.

It is simply if in fact the

employee feels he is discharged, he has the procedural

43
requirement of filing a. charge with EEOC and in perfecting
his remedies,, which, in this case, Mr, Hardison did so.
Therefore, there is no excessive governmental
entanglement involved in the situation»
We simply have a reasonable accommodation as; long as
it does not cause undue hardship to the employer's business»
Nov/, are we to say that that is such a heavy burden?
I suggest it is less a burden than the duty imposed by
Griggs, to show that something is job-related and, to justify
it, you must 3hcw business necessity»
TWA did not have to do very much, and they did vary
little. They did write a letter, and that's about where it
ended»
QUESTION:

If a supermarket chain had a fixed policy

of not hiring any Sabbatarians in a supermarket, would they
be violating some federal statute?
MR» PICKETT:

Yecs, they would, they would be

violating — if you're referring .to Saturday Sabbath
observers.— the statute in question.

As long as, again,

the test has to.be locked at, the facts of

each case»

If,

in fact, the Saturday man was the only clerk, and it was a
one-clerk store, as in some of the cases like Johnson vs.
U_. Sc Postal Service, then in fact it would be an undue
hardship on the —
QUESTION:

Well, one more step, then:

suppose a

44
large grocer}' chain says they will not employ, in a particular
area, such as the Washington Metropolitan Area, more than
10 percent of persons who have their Sabbath on Saturdays?
would they be violating some federal law?
MR» PICKETTs

Here in Washington, and it would be

a private employer with a requisite number of employees, they
would be violating now Section 733(j) , I believe- the
reasonable accommodation provisions»
QUESTION: So that if they tried to have some
ad jus trrcent from their own point of view to the necessities
of running a supermarket store on Saturday and Sunday,, which
they all do now, I understand, they all operate on Saturday
and Sunday, the two busiest days of the week, would they be
in violation if they either refused to hire Sabbatarians or
put a. quota limit on the number of them?
MR» PICKETT:

It. would have to determine upon the

facts of each case» What’s reasonable?

Reasonable is so

important in the particular application of tills statute»
What’s a reasonable accommodation?

How many employees they

have, what are their hours -QUESTION:

Well- the purpose of the supermarket is

perfectly obvious, that they want to have enough clerics on
Saturday and Sunday to talc© care of the overwhelming number
of shoppers that do their shopping on Saturday and Sunday»
So that's their need

45
MR. PICKETTs

I think the federal law’s congressional

dictate supersedes their sole need, if that’s it, because the
second step, of course, that one — the district court looks
at, is whether or not there is an undue hardship. And one
does not get to a hardship being undue, or less than that,
until something besides a letter requesting a meeting is
in fact participated in.
QUESTION:

What's your answer to — what is the

employer supposed to say to the — say ten people com€; in and
say, 31 We don’t want to work on Saturday, we want to go to the
football game and. watch our children play, but we’ll work
on Sunday? and you let these religious practitioners off on

I realize that, but —

MR. PICKETT:

— the sincerity of —*
So you do say that the employer — that

Congress is perfectly justified in requiring the employer to
give benefits to the religious practitioner that he will not
give to others?
MR. PICKETT:
is a benefit.

I respectfully disagree that there

They are ~~

QUESTION:

You don’t think it’s a benefit if they

can get off on Saturday and see their children play?
MR» PICKETT;

I thought you were referring to the

religion person getting a benefito
QUESTION;

Well, why isn't it a benefit?

They are

getting off on Saturday to practice their religion,,
MRo PICKETT;

Because this is basically a society

in which we observa the Sabbath on Sunday, and it is a neutral
policy/ that Congress chose to in fact effect ~~
QUESTION;

I know, but here is —

QUESTION;

It's not neutral as between people who

want to see their kids play football on Saturday, and people
who want to observe the Sabbath on Saturday„

It's not

neutral in that respect, surely,
MRo PICKETT;

I would concur with you, Mr» Justice

Rohnquist„
QUESTION;

Well, at least there are some people

that the employer is required to let off on Saturday and
other people that h® is not required to let. off on Saturday?

For religious purposes, if in fact

MR0 PICKETT:

So the answer is yes?
Yes»
He can say no to the people who want to

go to the : football game, but he must say yes to the people who
want to go to church on Saturday?

MRa PICKETTs
QUESTIONS

Depending on the circurastanc®s —
Well/ there isn't any circumstances

as I understand your position? no circumstances at all»

He

must let the people off on Saturday»
MR» PICKETT:

If TWA had only three people who in

fact could have dona this particular job? and in fact would
have shown that it would hamper them tremendously in that
particular aspect? I would say they would not have had to
accommodate him, because it would have been an undue hardship
and in fact they would not have violated the law»
QUESTION: So if it costs them a little bit, it's
all right? but if it coste them a lot, it’s not all right?
Sc it’s just a reasonableness thing»
MR. PICKETT:

There is a reasonableness test,

which on® has to be determined by the district court, and I
think Franks vsvBowman echoes that.
QUESTION:

Would you say that the district court

review and EEOC review and Court of Appeals review and -the
review by this Court is government entanglement with religion,
*

in the sense that it was used in Waiz?
MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

Mr. Pickett.

MR. PICKETT:
QUESTION:

No.

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.
May I put a hypothetical:

let's assume

that tee Worldwide Church of God — and this is a hypothetical

48
*— it does use the radio extensively, as I understand it?
let’s assume that in addition to its basically religious
emphasis, that it sought to persuade people to become converts
by emphasising the advantage of not having to work on
Saturday, ana the protection afforded by Title VTI in that
respecto
If you had a case with extensive emphasis on-that
advantage, would you view it differently from the way you
view your case here today?
MR» PICKETTj

Taking your hypothetical and not the

facts of this case, no, I would not, because the law addresses
itself to the purpose of employment security, purging inter­
state commerce with those things that are impermissible in
in fact protecting employment security»
And the benefit, if any, which is incidental to the
person, is to the person, not to any religious groups, and
he cannot be credited with what his church may or may not
say over the radio»
QUESTIONS But if the church membership were very
substantially augmented by the popular appeal that its members
would not have to work on Saturday, do you think there would
be any advancing of religion in those circumstances?
MRe PICKETTs
QUESTION:
MR» PICKETTs

No, I do not»

And we're —

You do not?
Pardon, I said I do not»

49
QUESTION:

You do not.

Even if memberships, say,

were increased by significant numbers, & million people
responded to an intensive radio campaign, "Join our church,
you won’t have to work on Saturday"?
MR. PICKETT:

I, at that point, would say the

district court, under Rule 52, in determining the credibility
and the sincerity of the individual, would be able to determine
that factor which would, of

course, kick off any reasonable

accommodation, if a person just joined for six months.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. PICKETT:

Very well, Mr. Pickett.

I appreciate the Court's time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lev/in, we will

restore two minutes of the -time to your

presentation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL JEWISH COMMISSION
ON LAW AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. LEWIN:

Thank you very much.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
As amicus in fills case, we have filed an extensive
brief responding, I think, to many of the questions that
were propounded during Cummins and Parker Seal, as reflected
in the transcript of that argument.

And in the limited time

available to vm this afternoon, I would really just like to
focus, 1' think, on two questions that have come up in the
course of ths oral argument today.

50

That is, the matter, one, of preference? and, fwo,
the effect of the collective bargaining agreement*
With respect to the question of preference, we
submit that there are

really three answers, to the argument

that this is a preferences
One, that is no more of a preference than the basic
prohibition in the statuta that says that employees may not
be discriminated against because of their religion.

Now,

no one challenges, and I think no party in either of these
two cases has challenged that belief to the extent: that the
word "religion" covers belief, would be covered by that.

No

employee may be fired because he believes in Allah or
because he believes in papal infallibility.
But there’s nothing in the statute that says that
an employee may not be fired because he believes in the
Democratic Party, or because he believes in socialised
medicine, or because he believes in the. Communist Party»
In other words, Congress says this form of belief, and maybe
actions related to it, arc entitled to protection.
So that, to the extent that an employes may say,
•'I have a

purely secular or philosophical belief," he is

not protected by the federal statute.

And yet a religious

5

belief entitles him to protection*

• •

And w© think that that, to the extent, than, that it
applies to any practice which, under -'She standard in this

51
statute, & practice that does not substantially affect an
employer's ongoing business
statute says.

and that’s really what the

If a practice that grows out of that belief

should not or does not substantially affect your business,
you're really discriminating against somebody on account of
his beliefo
Now, the question

if I might just simply then

turn to a second reason why we think this is not a preference,
and that iss

that it is simply,even to the extent that it

provides some form of protection for a practice

and this

Court’s cases in Cantwell, in Sherbert, and others, have
recognised that practices protected under the free exercise
clause, to the extent: it covers practice is not a preference,
it’s simply an equalizer provision.

Because, particular with

respect to the question that comes up in this case, such as
Sabbath observance, our society is permeated with majoritarian
religions customs that make life comfortable, easier for those
who adhere to the majoritarian faith,
Sunday laws, which this Court recognized in McGowan
vs. Maryland, are the most obvious illustration of that.

But

one need not go to general Sunday laws, one can look to the
r

very provisions of the collective bargaining-agreement in this
record, which recognised Christmas and Good Friday as holidays
under the. collective bargaining agreement.
And there was testimony, in addition, that ova::

52
weekends, and apparently on Sundays, — in responding to Mr.
Justice Stewart's question about what did this company do
with regard to Sundays — I think, notwithstanding the fact
that they are a seven-day-a-week operation, 24 hours a day,
there was testimony that there were only skeleton staffs over
the weekend»
So it's very likely, both in view of that and in
view of the fact, ©van, that Missouri had a statute, not
quite as ex-tensive as the absolute protection for Sunday
observers that appfc&rs in Sharbert v. Verner, that Mr» Justice
Brennan cited in the Court’s majority opinion in Sherbert v„
Verner, that says that no Sunday observer may be forced to
work against his religious conviction, but Missouri also had
a statute, effective until 1963, which prohibited every person
from compelling or permitting his apprentice or servant or
any other person under his charge or control to labor or
perform work on Sunday,
Nov/, that was substituted for later on by a more
customary form of Sunday law? but, nonetheless, there has been
a general practice in Missouri and elsewhere to recognise
that Sunday is the kind of day which, because it has

its

basis originally in religion, people should be entitled to be
off.
Now, what this statute does is it

accommodates

minority faiths who don't have the advantage or convenience of

53
having Sunday, and it. accommodates particularly those who have
very firm and strong conscientious convictions in this regard»
This is not simply — Congress, I think, has recognised that
this is not simply a matter of preference or some greater
desire, possibly like watching a football game, to the
community that I represent, that we as .amicus represent here
■today, the Orthodox Jewish Community, for example, the
Worldwide Church of God Community, the Seventh Day Adventist
Community, this is an absolute inescapable, unconditional
block»

There is no way that an Orthodox Jew will accept

employment which requires him to work on Saturday.
And Congress, I think, recognised that, and we have
recognised that in the actions that we have taken, our
organization has taken --*• the various resuite of that appear
in the appendix to our brief.

I ■think the Chief Justice

asked about supermarkets, for example.

We’ve negotiated a

substantial number of situations as a result of the enactment
precisely of this kind of a statute, under which Orthodox Jews
have been employed in supermarkets and have worked on
Sundays or on other holidays in place of working on the
Sabbath, when they could not be employed.
So this has been an absolute roadblock.

The real

fact is that employers cite hardship, cite neutral rules as
an original objection? but, in the actual implementation of
this kind of a statute, in the actual negotiation, we have

54
discovered that the problems disappear„
This Court has heard this morning about the problems
of the collective bargaining agreement,,

The TWA counsel could

not provide an answer to Mrc Justice Stevens' question
simply said

,

he

it was the collective bargaining agreement with

all its very rigid provisions•
And counsel for the union simply saids

Well, we

don't allow variations from -that collective bargaining agree­
ment a
In fact, if TWA, a massive employer with 200 people
on the site, could not accommodate by allowing this individual
to work on Sunday, which is a less desirable day to work, and
when they need employees, rather than working on Saturday,
it's hard to see who could accommodate.
Certainly the statute, to the extent that it provides
for undue hardship, is speaking about small employers such
as the ones in Johnson v. Postal Servies or other cases,
or, to take the Chief Justice's illustration, where there is
a larga number, if in fact that is a large number of
Sabbatarians, and an employer can show, "We can't hire more
than tan parcent, because we need 90 percent of our work
force on Saturday”, we would recognize that that satisfies
tee s hatute.
QUESTION:
violate federal law

But your colleague said that that would

55

MR. LEWIN:

I think the courts would recognise that,.

Your Honor/ that that is precisely what the undue hardship
provision provides.
Let me turn briefly/ just in the minute or two I
have remaining/ to the collective bargaining agreement0
We think that the collective bargaining agreement
provides absolutely no right whatever in the face of the
statute,

h collective bargaining agreement is an agreement

between an employer and a group of his employees in which the
employer signs over rights that he has , in the absence of the
agreement/ to the organisation representing his employees.
He can't sign — I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, you do recognise that with a

bargaining agreement./ the employer is not free to follow th©
law and ignore the agreement, is ha?
MR. LENIN;
QUESTION:

Oh, we —
He's going to have trouble/ isn't he?

MR. LEWIN: With all respect, —
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIN:

Isn't he going to have trouble?
H© may have trouble, but if that union

gives him trouble, ha can take them to court.

Because wa

think they cannot prevent him from following the law.

Wa

think that all that -the agreement entitles the employer to do
is to assign fco the union rights that he has —
QUESTION:

I think that what the law says, that

56

whatever you can do without, interfering with agreements and
other things , you must do.
or not»

The others have fco be reasonable,

And I think the whole thing goes into reasonable

crucible.
MR. LEV?IK: Well, but, Mr, Justice Marshall, ---■
QUESTION: Don't you think that the agreement is a
part of the reasonable?
MR. LEWIN: An agreement is part of the reasonableness
rule, yes.
QUESTION:

That’s all I want.

MR. LEWIN; We agree with that. But we think an
the union speaks here of rights, as if the rights grow out
to the union and the employees against fcha whole world.
An employer couldn't sell the Brooklyn Bridge in his collective
bargaining agreement and then have his employees or his union
say, "We have rights to the Brooklyn Bridge, because you put
it into the agreement."
QUESTION: Well, TWA doesn’t own it.
MR. LEWIN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
TWA doesn't own the Brooklyn Bridge.

MR. LEWIN; Well, that’s exactly it. And they don’t
own Hardison’s right to an accommodation under the federal
statute.

That’s precisely the analogy, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

th® union

But they also have an agreement with

57
MR® LEV?IN:

in which —

QUESTION: And they cannot ignore it0
MR® LEWIN: We'ra not suggesting they ignore it# but
the agreement with the union —
QUESTION: That’s what I thought you were saying#
that tiis union agreement had nothing to do with it®
MR® LEWIN: Well# we say the union agreement cannot
override the statute# because whatever the employer can
assign away

and that's all that the union agreement is#

we think -that the cases demonstrate that a union agreement is
a contract between an employer and his employees® And it
says# from an employer# "I give over to you the right to
assign employees# to transfer them# to use seniority
provisions'1,, but he can't assign over something that he
doesn't own®

He can't assign the Brooklyn Bridge and he

can’t assign the rights of Mr® Hardison.
QUESTION:

I suppose a closed shop agreement would

be no defense in a right-to-work State# on a claim by someone
who refused to join a union# even though -the closed shop
agreement had been signed by both the union and the employer®
MR® LEWI*?:

Absolutely®

And we submit that a unior,

collective bargaining agreement that said the employer may
not hire female employees would not be a defense# even if
the employer would say# "Well# as soon as I hire a female
employee# the union is going to get after me®"

But that's a

58

violation of the law*

You can81 contract away a right that

the statute gives to third parties*

And that/s what the TWA

has tried to claim here*
They've tried to claim that their hands have been
tied because they have contracted away Mr* Hardison's rights*
They have no right to contract away Mr* Hardison’s rights,
no more than they have a right to sell the Brooklyn Bridge*
Thank you*
QUESTIONS

But you agree they are contracted away

by th© very clause in the statuta relating to business
necessity and reasonableness, are -they not?
MR. LEWIN:

To that extent, Mr. Hardison's right

is limited, yes.
QUESTION:
MR* LEWIH5

Yes.
In other words, the employer may say,

"I can contract away to -the union Hardison's right to only
require a reasonable accommodation of ms."
QUESTION: Therefore, it follows that the free
exercise clause, in your position, is not an. absolute
guarantee, it's a conditional guarantee.
MR* LEWIN:

It's conditional, and it depends on

an evaluation of various circumstances.

And we argue in our

brief, I think extensively, and we submit on that brief, that
it is proper for Congress, in order to implement the free
■exercise clause against private parties, to enact a statute

59
such as this f to protect religion®
Thank you®
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have some rebuttal?
You have five minutes, Mr. Ratner.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MOZART G. RATNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IAM&AW
MR. RATNER:

In view of the shortness of time

remaining, I am going to have to rely principally on my
reply brief, which does dispose, I think, of most of the
contentions Your Honors have heard, but I want to make several
pointso
One, I think it's established from the argument
already that despite Mr. Lewin's peculiar use of the term
"discrimination" and "preference”,, we do have her© a statute
which affords a discriminatory preference to religious
adherence a.s distinguished from people who want to violate
4

•

or not to comply with uniform rules requiring attendance at
work, who want to do so for valid secular reasons.
Nov/, with respect, to that discrimination aid the
preference accorded religious adherents: because of that, we
•think the Chief Justice's comment in his dissenting opinion ir.
Nygulst is controlling.

The. discriminatory enactment favoring religious
over nonreligious activities would plainly be governmental

60

sponsorship of religious activities„
And the reason that is so is because discrimination
is partiality, and partiality is the antithesis of neutrality„
And contrary to the observations that were made by opposing
counsel, the assumptions that they have made, in our sub­
mission the religious activities that may not be promoted
by such discriminatory enactment are not. activities merely
of religious institutions, but cover those of religious
adherents as well, including the observation of the Sabbath»
As far as the constitutionality of this section 701
(j) resting on the same premise as the prohibition of
discrimination against religious beliefs and observers,
let me merely say that to safeguard religion and religious
practices against discrimination is to betray and disclose
benevolent neutrality in its true sense■»

But to afford

them a discriminatory preference by expropriating rights
and benefits of others and conferring them upon the religious
observers, that is, to say the least, partiality, sponsorship,
and that is what the establishment clause prohibits»
The essential theory of the opposition case is that
this Court must balance undue hardship against the need of
the religious observer®
The other part of that balance is a determination of
hew important is the particular practice in the matrix of that
particular religion, and how vital is that particular practice

61

which the observer seeks to accommodate to his own religious
beliefs , how important is it to hixa?
It is that kind of question which employers and
unions, OEG’s and district courts and Courts of Appeals and
this Court will be plunged into if this statute is given the
construction which our opponents contend? and that’s
entanglement with religion on a completely different level
than anybody has seen it in any statute that’s heretofore
reached this Court«
Finally, I want to say that the assumption on which
the theory here rests, that Congress can somehow demand that
employers and unions reasonably accommodate the religious
practices of employees, is predicated on analogies, the cases
like Sherbert ys. Verner and a line of argument which this
Court examined in full and rejected in the Nyquist case,

QUESTIONs

Mr. Ratner, I asked your colleague on

the other side whether the collective bargaining contract was
implicated here at all.

Is it your suggestion that the

collective bargaining contract stood in the way of the kind
of reasonable accommodation that your opposition indicates
should have occurred here?
MR. RATNER;

With two exceptions.

The company

could have held employees overtime and they paid them over"
time, and that wouldn't have bothered us.

They could have

allowed him to work a four-day week* as I understand it;
that wouldn't have violated the collective bargaining agreement.
All that —

my submission that that’s just —
QUESTION;

Well, it seems to me — the position

on the other side must worry you sufficiently, that here
you are.

I mean, is their position broader than that?

I

guess their position is that even if it did trample on

MR. RATHER;

Yes, tiiat4s right.

MR. RATHER:

Of course.

That’s why I’m here.

Mr. Ratner, I ask this only because of

something in your brief.
MR. RATHER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Do you think that this Court, in General
Electric v« Gilbert cut back a bit on Duke Power v. Griggs?
MR. RATHER:

Must I?

65

QUESTION?
MR, RATNER;

Pag© 17,
I'd prefer not to answer that questi oil,

[Laughter, 3

if I may.

QUESTION;

All right,

QUESTION;

Mr, Ratner, let me ask you one question,

Do you understand the statute to provide that in

order to be triggered, the employee must say, "I simply will
not work on the Sabbath, and even if it turns out that no
reasonable adjustment can be made and I lose my job as a
result, that's the way it is", or that he can come in and
simply say "I prefer not to work on the Sabbath”?
MR, RATNER;

Well, I think that any indication that

he'd like to be accommodated, that he’d like to have something
done so that he wouldn't have to work on the Sabbath, is
enough to trigger a constitutionally construed obligation
under this statute, for a company to see if something can be
done reasonably to accommodate him. We said that in our brief,
QUESTION;

Well, would the .reasonableness of the

company’s reaction depend, in part, on the intensity of the
belief?
MR, RATNER:

That's ray — the last point I made

was that it would depend in part on the intensity of the
belief and the nature of the practice and how important it
is in the hierarchy of that religion and how important in
the hierarchy of that individual’s observance of it.

66

And I suggest to Your Honors that that’s the very
reason why this statute cannot conceivably stand* Because
that's the worst entanglement that ever was with religion*
QUESTION:

Mr. Rafcner, there was a really simple

answer to Justice Blackmun's question, that I wrote, the
