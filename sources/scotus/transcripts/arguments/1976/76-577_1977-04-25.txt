PROCE E DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-577, zacchini v. Scripps-Board Broadcasting Company.
Mr. Lanci one, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. LANCIONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LANCIONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court; I am John Lane ion©, arguing for the petitiones'.
In this case ws are here by virtue of the question
involving the applicability of freedom of the press in the
First Amendment as it is and has been applied to the right of
publicity as expressed by the Ohio State Supreme Court.
In our case, a public performer, a man who has an
act known as the human cannonball, was performing ai; a local
fair and I believe th© critical facts in this case revolve
around the ws.y th© news media ended up putting his performance
on its news show, and that is a newspaper reporter, a free­
lance reporter, want to the fair and mad a an inquiry of Mr.
zacchini concerning the filming of his act and was told specific­
ally that this privilege was rejected and that he did not wish
his act to be filmed by th© reporter.
The reporter returned and spoke to the news manager
and was told by way of affidavit to go out and film th© act,
and indeed he did, and the act takes 15 seconds for Mr. zacchini
to comp lot®.

That is his only professional show, and that, is

4
the entirety of his performance.

Ha is shot out of a cannon

and travels several hundred feet in the air» lands in a nat»
in 15 seconds» and that is the ©nd of it.

It is dramatic» it

is unusual» and that is why I take it that h@ has been able to
sell this act around the country and make a living.
The Supreme Court of Ohio, in response to our motions,
stated that there is indeed a right of publicity that inheres
in a professional entertainer8s act, that he has a property
right to govern how» when and where his performance is pub­
lished .
QUESTION:

Do they identify it as a property right.?

MR. LANCIONE:

A proprietary interest» I believe»

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That is not -- .is that in the syllabus?

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Nell» they call --

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

I —

Syllabus, yes.

A performer has a right to the publicity

value of his performance.
MR. LANCIONE:

Well, tha invasion of privacy in

syllabus one, Your Honor, refers to the benefit of the name and
likeness of another being subject to liability to the other for
invasion of his privacy, and then they refer to this right of
the publicity value in his performance.

I think in the

language they say proprietary interest but, in any ©vent, it is

5
a substantial right that an individual has, a private individual
who seeks to become an entertainer.

And -they say that this

right of publicity inter as in his performance.
Now then they go, they take a step further and in
the third syllabus they say the First Amendment, however, allows
the press to report in a newscast; matters of legitimate public
interest.
QUESTION:

Well, would you call this reporting or

reproducing?
MR. LANCIONE:
duction.

I would call this a verbatim repro­

They went in with a TV camera and they filmed every­

thing ha had ‘to show.

The only reason that it occurred, I

would suggest, is because it was a 15 second act and he
specifically rejected their proposal to put it on the news
show.
QUESTION:
Ohio casas

Wa have beer, told a good many times in

when they com© here that the law of the case is the

syllabus, the head note, not the opinion.

Is that binding on

— is that law of Ohio?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:
law

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Now, is that particular concept of Ohio

binding on this Court in a First Amendment case?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don't think so.

I think that this

Court must look behind the bare syllabus / the three paragraphs
that summarize what happened and determine what the facts were.

6
QUESTION:

Iv'ell, we have accepted it tacitly I think

as binding for soma purposes, that is why —
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I focused, on — I focus on th© proposi­

tion is it binding on this Court when we are dealing with a
First Amendment case which is the First Amendment not being the
exclusive property of the courts of Ohio.
MR. LANCIONE:

I think for that purpose that is true.

I was suggesting that to determine what actually happened and
what the court is saying, the court must take into considera­
tion the facts, but I think syllabus three is what we ar© deal­
ing with.
QUESTION;

Mr. Lancione, in that respect, I notice

that the Court of Appeals opinion, in looking at page A28, in
paragraph 3 —-I guess these are head notes, is that so?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

No, that is not.

The only binding --

That court says "A performer's 'act' is

the product of his talent.

As such it is property entitled to

the same protection under th© common law as any other property
right."

Does that holding have any significance in this case

in light of th© absence of some similar statement from the
syllabi?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because

in. th® Court of Appeals th© head notes ar© not the law of th©
case in Ohio, but --

7

QUESTION;

So we may ignore that and concentrate on

th© syllabi one, two, three, is that it?
MR. LANCIONE:
property right.

No, I an contending that it is a

I believs it is *—

QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is certainly it is

not stated as explicitly by the Supreme Court in its syllabi
as is stated by th© Court of Appeals.
MR. LANCIONE:

That is true, Mr. Justice Brennan, it

is not.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any significance in that

the Supr®na Court didn’t use the same phraseology?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don't think so.

particular significance to it.

I don't see any

I think that they hsiv© created

a substantive right, a tort, remedy, the invasion of the right
of publicity.

To state it in terms of property, personalty or

realty, I don't think is th© intent of using the word
"property" or proprietary interest."
QUESTION:

And th© right to the publicity value of
\

his performance —
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— is explicable only if they mean by

that that it is tantamount to property?
MR. LANCIONE:

Yes, I think they do mean that, but I

don't think t.h©v have stated it specifically in the Supreme
Court syllabus.

8

QUESTION;

Could you give me the difference between

the right of publicity and the right of privacy?
MR. LANCIONE;

Yes, Justice Marshall.

The right of

privacy is the right to have those matters kept, away from the
public which the public has no right to know about.

For ex­

ample , in the Firestone case, I believe that the right, of
privacy was involved because the reporter cited the fact that
a counterclaim had been dismissed when it dealt, with adulteryon the part of Mary Alice Firestone.

And it also has -- the

right of privacy prohibits those in the media or anyone els©
from giving a false light to facts which are known to the
public.

Where the right of publicity is almost the opposite.
An entertainer wants to ba in front of the public,

he wants to ha publicised and advertised, and I am sure Mr.
Zacchini would have appreciated the fact that they m@ntiorf.sd.
on their show or showed a picture of him and said "Hugo
Zucchini is going to b© shot out of a cannon.“

I mean be prob­

ably would loved to have Channel 5 put -that on ©vary half hour
so he would g'et more people out there to enhance the value of
his act.
QUESTION:

So h® does advertise?

MR. LANCIONE;

Oh, yes.

QUESTION; His show?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION;

Yes, he does.

Mr. Laneion®, would you bs here if there

a

had been just a still photograph of him la raid “flight rather
than the 15-second tap©?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION;

Ho.

No, Your Honor, I wuid not.

What is tli© difference?

MR. LANGIONE;

I think that the news media has a

right to publicise in an ©Bfesrtaiment section, for example,
•they can advertise to the public that there is an entertainment,
section on their 11 o'clock news show, and they can tell about
everyone of import or of little import who is performing in
and about tha area where their readers and listeners are con­
cerned about.
But what we have hare is the taking of an entire
total performance.
QUESTION;
bit.

Let me change my question then a little

Suppose this performance had been in a public square or

in -- they used to have on© in Cleveland -- suppose it had
been there, free of charge, would it make any difference?
MR. LANCI ONE;

No, I dc /not believe that the media

has tha right under the First Amendment privileges as they
have been enunciated and interpreted to publish, to capture and
publish a performer's entire act.

I think that is protected.

His act in its entirety becomes his peculiar proparty, and I
don't think that under any circumstances, unless there is a
waiver, which the Supreme Court of Ohio declared there was not,
that the news madia can com® in and say we call it news and

10

therefore we can do whatever w® want to.
QUESTIONS

To what extent, however, is h@ subject to

what the entrepreneur, the impresario does or does not do?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Well, if it was a private matter ---

Would it make any difference?

MR. lanciONE:

~ between the people who have con­

tracted for him to com© in and perform, I don't think we are
dealing with that.

I think that whatever arrangement h@ makes,

he may waive seme right for the person who has purchased his
act -QUESTION:

Well, let me read you what is at the bottom

of performances, the program at the Kennedy Canter herei

"The

taking of photographs and th® us© of recording equipment are
not allowed in this auditorium."
■th® Kennedy Center.

This is by the management of

Does this reflect at all on th© situation?

Suppose that statement were just the reverse, that th® taking
of photographs is permissible in the Kennedy Center?
MR. LANCIONE:

Well, I think that if it did say that

and there was probably nothing said to the persons who came
into th© fair in Burton County, Ohio, I don't think —
QUESTION:

Or into Kennedy Center?

MR. LANCIONE?

That's right

I don't think the news

medica can com© in under the guise of th® First Amendment and
captura any performer's complete act unless there is a waiver.
There may be a waiver in the circumstances that you are

11
discussing*, if th© performer knows that there will b@ parsons
in there recording his performance h© may be held to waive,
but news programs don't only take; 15 minutes or half an hour,
some programs take an hour.

There are special news shows.

And the point that puts this in an appalling perspective is
that any time the news media calls it news under the third
syllabus they are granted an indefeasible immunity and privilege
by it.
QUESTION;

Would you be here if Ohio had just said

under our law there is no right in publicity, no property
right or any other kind of right in this man?
MR. LANCIONE;
QUESTION;

Well, I don't think —

You don't think th® First Amendment gives

it to him?
MR. LANCIONE:

No, I don't think it is a First Amend­

ment -QUESTION;

So that is a matter of.Ohio law?

MR. LANCIONE;
law,

I think it is a matter of Ohio tort.

like anything ©Is®.
QUESTION:

Mi at, if th© Ohio court had said, wall, we

recognize that there is a right,

a proparty right of publicity

or whatever you want to call it, but as a matter of Ohio law
the press has a limited privilege of reporting it and they have
not exceeded it in this case?

Suppose that is what the third

syllabus had said, you wouldn't bs here either, would you?

12
MR, LANGIONE;

If there was no interpretation of the

First Amendment, I would not be here.
QUESTION;

Wall, then, how do wa know how they

if

you just look at the syllabus her©, it doesn’t say, does it,
whether it is a First Amendment

they took a First Amendment

approach, whether they thought the First Amendment required the
privilege or whether they are just announcing a matter of Ohio
law?
MR. LANG IONE;

Wa are permitted, Mr. Justice Whit©,

to look into the body of the decision to interpret the syllabus
of the case.

And on page A13, the court clearly states that

"Tha effect of this holding, and of that in Haw York Times Co.
v. Sullivan, is that tha press has a privilege to report matters
of legitimate public interest even though such reports might
intrude on matters otherwis a private."

And then they go on

and —
QUESTION;

Excuse me, "this holding” does not refer

to Tim© v. Hill?
MR. LANCTONE:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

Th© effect of that holding and. of Shllivan?

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

Yes, Your Honor.

Excuse me.

MR. LANC1ONE:

Then it goes on to analogis® the

reasoning and to say that the rights as enunciated, which give
privilege of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to

13
speak out on issues that are public, and in th© dissent in the
G©rtz case it was pointed cut, I believe by Mr. Justice White,
that he would have found differently because this was a comment
upon a judicial proceeding.

So that all of the privilege that

has been granted has been granted, so far to expression first of
all about public officials and then in Hill about a public in­
tar eat which is th© opening of a new play, then wa go to the
Butz case involving a football coach, aj®d to Gen. walker’s
speaking out on public issues — this bears no resemblance I
submit to a matter like we have her©.
This is a private individual, a private citizen who
has certainly subjected himself tc criticism by the press.

I

think that he, stands in th© same shoes as Gen. Walker ©r any
other entertainer.
QUESTION:

Suppose in the two syllabi, two and there,

there had been a final phras® on there "under Ohio law,” under
two and three?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don't think, Your Honor, that this

would have
QUESTION:

Well, you admit that two is under Ohio

lav??
MR. LANCIONE:

Yes.

This is a tort created as a

common law right in Ohio.
QUESTION:

And three is also under Ohio law, a TV

station has a privilege to report, where would you be there?

14

MR. LANCIQNE;

Well, I think we would b© ia tha same

exact position we are now, and that is —
QUESTIONS

There would be so federal question, would

there?
MR. LANGZONE:

I think there would be.

I think there

would be, Your Honor* because behind that syllabus, syllabus
two and three, still lias tha facts and circumstances and tha
reasoning, the express reasoning of the court,

w© can't reject

that.
QUESTION;

Well, I assume that Mr, Justice Marshall’s

question presupposes that you would not have that material on
p&g® 13 that explicated the federal aspact
MR. LANCIONE;

I think if there was no reliance what­

ever on the First Amendment, then, vm would not have the question
that w© have hare, and that is exactly what you had in Carts.
On page 330 of the opinion in Gertz, they said this casa is
her© because the petitioner contests the applicability of the
First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of Mr. Gartz.
QUESTION;

Do you g@t son© support for your position

from that Footnote 5 at the bottom of page 14, "th© gravamen
of the issue in this cass is not whether th© degree of intrusion
is reasonable# but whether First Amendment principles require
that th© right of privacy giv© way to the public right to be
informed of matters of public interest and concern."

The con­

cept of privilege seems to be a more useful and appropriate on©?

15
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

--by the opinion?

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

I think that —

You said that the syllabus may be

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION?

Yss.

Yes.

And so you may you rely on Footnote 5?

MR. LANCIONE:

Yes, as part of the opinion, Your

Honor, yes, wa may.
QUESTION:

Let me pos© a hypothetical to you, and I

am going to ask your friend to comment on the same hypothetical
later on when his turn comes.

When Mohammed Ali engages in on©

of his professional exhibitions of prig© fighting, I understand
that the ratio is about ten—to-or.e or more, that the TV rights
are many, many times the income he receives from th© persons
who are present at the arena.
Suppose surreptitiously either one of th© networks
or an outlaw group filmed th© entire fight and 'then triad to
put it on the air.

Do you analogize your client's situation
;

to what that would b© with Mohammed Ali?
MR. LANCI ONE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I feel that ~

I assume that you have TV rights, your

client?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don't know that for a fact, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, Mohammed Ali does.

16

MR. LANCIGNB:

I am sure that ha doas.

a legal proposition ha does.
that? I do not know.

In fact, as

Whether he has some program for

But I think that it wouid be the very

same situation if on a program or, fine arts the media would go
into the concert hall and taps the eighth symphony, Beethoven's
Eighth Symphony, which symphony doesn't take more than half an
hour, and play th© entire synphoxy.
The difference in our case is stronger because Hugo
Zacchini only has one performance.
ent tun© like a violinist.

He doesn't play any differ­

Ha has one 15-second act, and. they

have captured that and they have captured that with his — over
his specific objection, which I think is very important.
Now, it has bean stated that this is a limited
privilege, but under the statement mad© in th© Suprone Court —
QUESTION:

How was his objection made in advance?

I

have lost track of that.
MR. LANCIONE:

There was an affidavit — the fre©-

Xance TV photographer came out and asked him if ha could film
his act and Mr. zacchini said no.
QUESTION:

Before he did it, I sea.

MR. LANCIONE:

Before he did it.

And than the ra-

portor went back and discussed this with his superios and th©
superiors apparently said ©r th© affidavit states in substance
"go back and do it,and h© did surreptitiously do that.
QUESTION:

Well, surreptitiously, wasn’t it in a

17

public place at which no admission was charged?
MR. L&NCIONE:

Yes, but he did it this tiraa without

permission and over the specific objections, I mean that he
did not get his permission whan he went back again.
QUESTION;
could be there.

But if no permission was necessary, he

You said h© never asked to do it, presumably

h© could have dona it without anybody objecting and nothing
surreptitious or off the record about it, is it any different
from doing something in a public park?

I think you have al­

ready answered that to Justice Blackmun.
MR. LANCIONE;

I think it is the same.

I just point

out that here it was —
QUESTION;

The objection really has no legal signifi­

cance in the case?
MR. L&NCIONE:

I think it makes a stronger case be­

cause the right as it may foe defined, the right of th© press
as it may bs defined is to act in a reasonable and responsible
fashion in fulfilling their obligation to report news.

I

think when you can establish that they go beyond that — now
here I do want to point out that in th© third syllabus this is
described as a limited privilege, I don’t think it is.

They

have the right to report in their newscasts matters otherwise
privileged unless it is for a non-privileged us©.

But one© you

establish that it is on a news program, it cannot be for a non­
news us© and therefore

18

QUESTION;

Do you think the Supreme Court of Ohio

would have reached a different result in your example of the
taping of the eighth synphony played at Kennedy Center?
MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION;

The Ohio Supreme Court would not have.

Even though that were put on an education­

al television station, not billed’ as news but just said, you
know, her® is a brand new performance of Beethoven's Eighth?
MR. LANCIONE;

Well, I think if it was outside of a

news shov/ing, the Supreme Court of Ohio may very well have come
to a different conclusion.

But what they have said relates to

news programs, as I read the third syllabus, and that-the only
exception is when it is a non-news use, which scans to me to ba
a non sequitur.

You can't have ~~ you can’t fit into the

right that depressed Gets under the First Amendment by the
Supreme Court by putting it on your news if it is a non-news
use.

In other words —QUESTION;

Did he have a contract to fulfill?

MR. LANCIONE;

At the Burton County Fair, yes, he

did. Your Honor, but that is —
QUESTION;

,

I gather from what the Supreme Court said

at page 15, no issue of disregard to contract rights is in­
volved* here?
MR. LANCIONE;
QUESTION:

That’s right, there is no actual —

This is just purely whether or not this

was the report of a news event or the appropriation of a right?

19

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTIONS

And under contract I assume h© was paid?

MR. LANCIONE;
QUESTION;

That’s right, and the other —

I presume he was.

And 'that is critical I suppos® to the

Supreme Court — to the Ohio rul© of a right of — if Mr.
zacchini had just don© this for the fun of it in a county park
or in a public square, just like they do it every now and then,
a
[L aught©: 3
And if a IV news camera had gone out there and re­
ported that as news, there would be no proprietary right that
had been appropriated, would there, because there was certainly
no monetary right?
MR. LANCIONE:

I don’t think that you would ba able

to establish any damages under the Ohio law because h© would
have no commercial value if he did not perform as a profession­
al entertainer.
QUESTION?

It was a property right for which h© was

paid?
MR, LANCIONE;
QUESTION;

That’s correct,

Under contract.

And that is critical,

isn’t it?
MR. LANCIONE;

Yes, it. is.

He is a professional en­

tertainer and that is to whom the right applies, the right of
publicity applies to an ©ntertainer or to a professional

20
athlete or to anyone who has developed some commercial value in
the use of their name and their image and their success.
QUESTION;

Suppose he had performed in the square in

front of the TV station for the general public to see?
MR. LANCIONE;

If he voluntarily performed in front

of the TV cameras and knew that he was going to be put on the
program, I think that that would ba a different factual situa­
tion.
QUESTION;

Why?

MR. LANCIONE;
QUESTION;

Because he —

Could you l?av® out all of that which was

added to my question and answer it?

If he performs in front of

the TV station in a public square, can-the TV station photo­
graph it and put it on the news program?
MR. LANCIONE;

I don’t think they could film his en­

tire act.
QUESTION;

If it is right; in their backyard?

MR. LANCIONE;
QUESTION;

In their front yard, rather.

MR. LANCIONE;
frontyard.

It is diffarent than doing it —

It is different than doing it in his

If he. was doing it as a canraercial act and TV

cameras were there -QUESTION;

If he was doing it and he was being paid

because as he got shot out of the cannon he had "Buy BXatz
Beer" on his back, could they publish that?

21

MR» IANCIONE:

Ko, I don’t; think they could publish

his entire act under any circumstances.
QUESTION;

If they shot it in fch® TV window, could

they do it then?
MR, LANCIONE:

Yes, I think that would ba an excep­

tion because •—
QUESTION;

The difference is?

MR. LANCIQNE;
QUESTION;

The difference is —

The difference is in the performance,

isn’t it?
MR. LANCIQNE;

Th© difference is that it is not his

performance any more, Mr. Justice Marshall, it is then an un­
toward event, as the event which I suggested in my brief,
where he would miss the net and break his legs, then I think
it becomes something different than his professional act.

It

is no longer his professional act because something untoward
has occurred.

So I think that is a different situation.

QUESTION;

Let ms ask you, in light of the colloquy

with my Brother Stewart, if you might look at A15, what is th©
significance in th© last sentence in that carryover paragraph;
"It might, also b© the case that th© press would b© liable if it
recklessly disregarded contract rights existing between the
plaintiff and a third person to present th® performance to the
public, but that question is not presented her©.'8
MR. LANCIQNE:

I'm sorry, page —

22

QUESTION:

Pag® A15.

MR. LANCIONE:
QUESTION:

Pag© A15.

It is th® last s@Btaa.ca in that carryover

paragraph, just bafor© the last paragraph of the opinion.
MR, LANCIONE:

I take it that they ar© referring to

th© fact that if -there was a contract between Mr.
t3i© parsons who hired him

z a echini

and

that his act was not to fee filmed,

that it would raise a differant question, but that is not th©
questiost raised here.
QUESTION:
©xclud© people,

He doesn't have to tak© the trouble to

on the theory of your cass, only those who

tak® th® television pictures who have paid for that right, who
have contracted with him for that or contracted with the county.
MR. LANCIONE:

To film the entire act I believe he

would have to give permission.

He would have to give tham per­

mission.
QUESTION:

That is what Mohammad All does, makes a

separate contract, he doesn't rely on chance.

Ha makes a

separate contract for the television rights.

j

MR. LANCIONE:

That is especially necessary in his

case, I would think.
The other point I wanted to make about the limited,
so-called limited privilege was that they have excepted a news
media presentation with actual intent to harm, and I think

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bryan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EZRA K. BRYAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRYAN:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it pleas© th©

Court:
I*

l still am perplexed after hearing my eminent ooponent her© really as to how wa got here.

When I first heard that

certiorari had bean granted in this case, I was at least

24

seriously puzzled and, as a matter of fact, had the apocryphal
thought that perhaps we had slipped back of the looking glass
with Lewis Carroll with Alice.
How, the explanations this morning in answering the
Court’s questions get us no place, it seems to me, either as to
fundamental facts or fundamental law that raises a serious
federal question that should b© hear©.
In th© factual area, there is emphasis on the origin­
ality of an artist’s act and that sort of thing *

There is a

book on circus that was written quit© a few years ago that is
an historical authority apparently on the subject by Marion
Murray, and in that book great credit is given to the zacchinls
as inventors, as fcrapize artists, as riders.

And on© of th©

things that first got them to notica in this country was th©
invention of a better mechanism for a cannon to project a
human being by Hugo’s father and his. brother, and Hugo was th©
fixst man who did it apparently with that mechanism, a batter
one.

But P. T. Barnura shot Mademoiselle Zarzelle out of a

cannon for sixty feet back in 187 9 and called it th© human
cannonball act.
QUESTION:

Thar© is nothing very original about the

performances of the eighth syaphony, but do you suggest that if
someone came in and covered it at Kennedy Center without th©
consent of th© performers, th© conductor and the members of th©
orchestra, that they could put it on television?

25

MR, BRYAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, and I don't: 'chink that this -—
Than what does the history have tha act

have to do with it?
MRo BRYAN:

— I don’t s©@ how this theory of a

uniqu© little situation of a 15-second act can apply on any
broad principle to the kind of question that you are raising,
sir.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the difference whether it

■takes 15 seconds or 3 0 minutes for the performance of Mr.
2acehini?
MR. BRYAN:

It would make a serious difference under

the definition of the media privilege by th® Ohio Supreme
Court.

They hav© said that the media may use it for news

contents but they may not appropriate tha benefit of th®
publicity for soma non-privileged privata use.

You can’t make

a news program, in my judgment, that is going to stand up in
the court of Ohio in th© face of that out of a full synphony.
QUESTION:

Wall, that wouldn't b© a non-privilegad

private use, it would be a use on th© news program, th© pre­
cisely the same use that was mad© of tha cannonball act her®,
wouldn’t it?
MR. BRYAN:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYAN:
QUESTION:

Well, I —
In th© hypothetical question?
Wall, I really —
It wouldn't be private use.

26
MR. BRYAN:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't see how we

are going to be able to conceive that the entire long perform­
ances of those people who are protecting themselves, they are
protected by th® notice on the ticket, there are contract
arrangements that ar© mad© and performers like Mr. Zacchini
enter into contracts with, people at fairs, at th© ball park
when they put on acts.

They have contracts which limit the

right of anybody to come in and taka it, and I would say that
in answer -bo tha question that Mr. Chief Justice asked about
Mohammed Ali, that there isn't any possibility in my judgment
that that would get by the State of Ohio.
The State of Ohio is not saying you can go in and
steal things and break contracts.
QUESTION:

Well, sane of Mohammad Ali's performances

last only about fifteen seconds.

Does that —

[Laughter]
Does that mean that the performance would b© open to
any surreptitious coverage by a television camera?
MR. BRYAN:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYAN:

Incidentally, this was not surreptitious.
Well —
The TV people, along with others, were

invited free in order to do this aid my eminent colleague —
QUESTION:
MR. BRYAN:

Not by Mr, Zacchini though?
No, but ha contracted to put on a per-

t

forraaaace for sora© promoters who did invite these people and he

did not have an agreement with then that would prevent the
taking of pictures.

As a matter of fact; the only facta in

this record do not support my eminent counsel's position with
respect to the matter of Zacchini seeking out the photographer
and objecting.

Thar© is an affidavit *—

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryan, before you get into that; your

preceding rsnark in response to the Chief Justice as to a dif­
ferent rule obtaining in Ohio if the promoters had excluded

the TV people; it is my impression that at least your

strained to reach the result it did here because of the First

exactly what they sought and found very briefly.
QUESTION:

But you say what they did was fashion a

principles, is that what you are saying?
MR. BRYAN:

Well, absolutely, Your Honor.

We have

in the State of Ohio constitutional provisions that are relatively comparable.

Well, it would have been easy for all of

us if they had rested on the Ohio Constitution and not on the
Federal Constitution.
MR. BRYAN:

Justice Brennan, is that there is so much looking toward
Washington any more, I wonder if we will all start to bow to

29

QUESTION*
MR. BRYAN;

I have said things about this myself.
AM on the First Amendment, I don’t think

there is any doubt about it.

But when you track on what

occurred her® on that subject, you find that the Ohio court
merely —- they studied Tim® v. Hill, Inc.

And ‘then my ©ni.nsnt

counsel has on his petition page brief, for guidance on that
issue, th® media privilege, the court turned to the rulings in
Time, Inc. v. Hill and New York Times Company v. Sullivan,
drawing from th© two cited authorities, the concept that the
news media possesses a privilege to disseminat® news of matters
of public interest.
Now, if you turn to his brief, on pages 9 and 10, you
will find that he concedes that this great high principle which
they drew from this study of these cases and th® restatement
is exactly the same thing.

I have great difficulty distinguish­

ing where he says that there is no question that th® broadcast
media has th© privilege end right to report newsworthy events
of public interest.
His quarrel is with th© line that the Ohio State

Suprema Court drew in his — and I submit rather minor sort of

QUESTION:

Well, I thought it was quite the contrary.

hav3 held was a property right that was protected, is struck
down by the First Amendment.
MR. BRYAN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do not think

that, our court looked at -this In any sens© as a property right.
And as a matter of fact, they knocked down a suggestion by
Judge Day on our Court of Appeals suggesting that there was

QUESTION;

Ars you really suggesting that by the

usual standards found in our cases as to whether or not a
federal question was passed upon the state court that under
this opinion we have no jurisdiction?
MR. BRYANs

Well, I think th@r® are two points, if

you please, Mr. Justice Whits.

On© point is that our court did

not feel compelled by the decisions of this Court or by the
First Amendment to hold the way it did.

They held that in a

common law case we will give this much right and no more.

And

I think that the second point is that this federal Court, I
respectfully submit, should not be going beyond the point of
dictating to the states what the minimum requirements are,

32
rather than saying that from now on w© will set in certain
common law situations,, we will set exact standards.

They ask

in the terminology of specifics all the way through.
And I believe that my friend has been guilty of a
Procrustean distortion of Gertz in trying to apply the situation
here.

First off, Gertz did involve libel per se, and here you

have a right of publicity case, a right of privacy-type action,
in which th© respondent was guilty only of broadcasting a brief
and very flattering account of a public par former.
QUESTION;

Let's begin on the proposition which I

think that you would agree that the Ohio court has said there
is in Ohio a common law right of publicity.

It would have been

a little more, understandable to me if they had said there was a
property right of a performer in his performance, of a profes­
sional performer in his performance, but they said there was a
publicity right, that there is no —■ that can b© protected by

So you begin with this proprietary right that is pro­

record, a gramaphon® record in which of course there is th©

MR. BRYAN;

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 can’t see.

that they felt compelled that way because they fait compelled
to the extent of finding a concept and principle which my
worthy opponent concedes, as I pointed out.
Now, the State of Ohio,I don't think there should b®
any doubt, if we look at the holding in Gertz there should be
no doubt that the state of Ohio, in granting or recognizing a
right of publicity — this isn't something that is nailed into
our constitution or fundamental statutory law, this is simply
\

sera ©thing that the court has granted and has put sera® strings
on it.
I submit that our court; could have granted it with
an absolute prohibition against, any right of ever recovering on
the right of publicity from the raws media or from w or from
radio or from newspapers.

I mean, this is a common law right

36

they were creating, and I don't sae how as long as they follow
the dictata of the holding in. Gertz thatthay may determine by
common law what th® liability will be for libel so long as they
do not go below th© standard of negligence.

I mean, it is a

minimum standard that- should be fixed, in my judgment, if th©
Court please, in this situation.
I will simply for th© sake of concluding suggest to
th© Court that th® plaintiff entered th© Ohio courts naked and
emerged clothed with a new common law right that was fashioned
by the Ohio Supreme Court.

AFTERNOON SESSION - Is 00 O'CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Mr. Bryan, do you have

something further?
MR. BRYAN:

Mr. chief justice and if the Court pleas©:

I have not nearly used the time, but I would like to very
briefly cover just four very quick points.
Number one, as a matter of fact, in this case there
was no treaspass; and, in additicn, there was no condition im­
posed by Zucchini in a way in which he could
from taking pictures.

prohibit anyon©

And the fact is that, as shown in the

appendix at page 55, the only evidence before the Ohio courts
on this subject was not what my worthy opponent says but be­
cause that is merely in the complaint and is never supported
by an affidavit, which is required under Ohio procedure.
The only affidavit states that zucchini seeing a
cameraman with a television-type :amar approached him and told
him ha did not want it don©.

The:© was no seeking out of

Zacchini to obtain consent or permission.

So it is no different

than if Zacchini had gone up to a Scout master who was there
with his Scout troop and wanted to take seme pictures and said
,sl don’t, want you to t&k© any pictures."

I don’t believe

there is any way that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bryan, there is some differences.

The

Boys Scouts wouldn't ba making use of ‘that for commercial pur­
poses for profit, whereas the television station would be.

38

Isn't ther© a difference?
MR. BRYAN:

took, tli© film clip they used, then we ar© dead under the law
of Ohio.

When a newspaper or a broadcaster repro­

duces something in its paper, it isn't doing it. for profit?
MR. BRYAN:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYAN:

Your Honor —
What is the enterprise for?
Your Honor, ther® is no doubt about that.

But that. Your Honor, I think it has been recognized in our
law to date, would be th® first step to total censorship in
this country. ■ You cannot, without having media, except for
throwaway free handbills — now, if you want to have somebody
who throws away free handbills — there is otherwise recognized,
and it has been recognized in decisions of this Court, that
ther© is a profit motive in publishing newspapers, there is a
profit motive in television, but if it is going to be the test
of news as to whether or not it is via a medium that is making
a profit, then, Your Honor, I submit that if© are: not far away
from total government control, as in some countries, of news,
so that you don't have any news except that which the ruling
approves.

39
The other point that I wanted to b® sure and clarify
was this matter ©f the right of privacy into the right of pub­
licity.

The original, the first recognition of th® right of

privacy in this country was in Hew York by statute, after* it
had been held that a little girl who had her picture used on a
flower sack, if I remember rightly, had no right of recovery
and they passed the commercial appropriation theory of th®
right of privacy.
How, Prosser has expanded into other areas that ara
somewhat, related.

The right of publicity was first recognized

as a name, as I recall it, by Judge Jerome Frank in the Tops
Trading Card case, the baseball players* pictures asd statis­
tics, and ha called — he said it might be more appropriately
known as the right of publicity.

So that even in New York

stata, where th© right of privacy is still controlled by th®
same statute, they have a common law right, now of publicity.
But the common law right of publicity that has been recognized
has been recognised as a right which can b© exercised only when
there is son© commercial us© in most places.
Our court actually has given a performer a greater
right under th© right of publicity because th© defense of the
media’s privilege is circumscribed a little, more than it would
be where the complainant would have to prove that there was a
commereial appr opriation.
And the final point that I would lik© to make, if the

40

Court please, is that this is a situation which in my judgment
very clearly if this narrow interest pisa of this plaintiff is
recognized as having any First Amendment or constitutional
breadth or rights would b® an act of beating the shield of the
First Amendment for free speech and fre® press into a sword,
and that sword would chop down th© historic right of the states
to determina their common law, subjact to nest violating some
federal law.
And in this case an area has always been nat violat­
ing the minimum standards determined by this Court applicable
to th® First Amendment privilege.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bryan, before you sit down, may I just,

ask you about the footnote that Justice Brennan directed coun­
sel ’s attention to in the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion, Foot­
note 5.

He read a portion of the sentence that talks about

th© gravamen and th® issue, and th© sentence ends with th©
words “the concept of privilege seems th© more useful and ap­
propriate one."

Do you know what I have in mind?

MR. BRYAN°

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

That is where,

if I remember rightly, that is where tha court was looking to
the restatement of torts for guidance along with New York Times
v. Sullivan and Time v. Hill, if I r@a®nber rightly.
QUESTION:
MR. BRYAN:

Yes, and the question —
And what th® court is doing there, as I

41
understand it, is referring to the fact that the restatement
after the time that they had written the restatement number 13,
which was the one that the court was using for guidance, had
cam® up with restatement number 21 and in that on© they rejiggarsd the language and approach a good deal and went from
privilege to something about reasonable —
QUESTION:

Well, they vers debating a choice between

whether the rule that would make the appropriation an unreason­
able invasion of

privacy on the one hand or a question of

whether it was privileged on the other.
MR. BRYAN:
QUESTION:

Right, sir.
And then they ©ad up with the language I

called your attention to, the concept of privilege seen3 the
more useful and appropriate on®.

AM the qiu@st.ion I wanted to

ask. you is whether in your view the word "privilege" in that
sentence is used in- the. sense of a corvtitutIona 1 privilege er
as an exception as a matter of state law from a tort doctrine?
MR. BRYAN:

Well, I think, sir, it could foe both.

As

a matter of fact, we have a constitutional privilege, too,
which fchcjy could have pointed to and we probably would not fo©
here if they had done that.
QUESTION:

Wall, if it is the constitutional privilege

then is it not fair to infer that the word "privilege" used in
the third paragraph of tins court's syllabus is also the con­
stitutional privilege?

That is what I am trying to get at.

42
MRo BRYAN:

Well, I think as a practical matter in

dictating th® common law of Ohio that they can us® the word
"privilege" as the practical rest It that they are Imposing.
There isn't any doubt that the court in Ohio felt that there
had to be a privilege by reason of the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

Well, would you say th© pr.ivi.iGgQ as a

matter ©f Ohio law is coaxtensive with the privilege commanded
by th© First Amendment?
MR. BRYAN:

Your Honor, we submit that in our judg­

ment in an appropriate ca^e we could be up here fighting that
it is not, that th© Ohio court particularly in the intent to
injure has probably gone beyond what we feel should be th©
First Amendment minimum privilege.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. LANCIONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~ REBUTTAL
MR. LANCIONE:
the Members of the Court:

Mr. Chi®-: Justice, and may it pleas®

43

I would lik© to point, out that th© Ohio Supreme
Court on that very same page where Wots AS is located on A14
in the record, they say specifically 1b the second paragraph
that under the standards articulated' by tha Court — and they
are referring to the Supreme Court — and they say Time v. Hill,
and they go on to describe the privilege.

And than they go

over once again in discussing these casas, they say that the
same privileg© exists in cases where appropriation of a right
of publicity is claimed.
They are talking about th® First Amendment privilege
that has been discussed, and that was discussed by then in
N@w York Times v. Sullivan and Hill, and 1 don’t think there is
any question that they feel constrained, just as the Seventh
Circuit I believe in Gertz fait constrainted by Rosenbloom to
say that th© standards of New York Timas v. Sullivan had to
apply to a private individual because they said it dealt with
an issue of public interest.
And tha court there, because my most worthy opponent
has raised the question of how we gat her© and why wa ware
here, the court stated in Gartz that th© petitioner appealed
to contest the applicability of th© New York Timas standard to
this case, and that is why they ware hare in Gertz, and that
is why wa are here.
In his brief he also points out that a new trial can­
not be ordered, but I think on page 352 of Gertz th© Supreme
