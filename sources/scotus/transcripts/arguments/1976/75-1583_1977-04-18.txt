PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1583, Morris against Gressette.
Mr. WolXenherg, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ROGER WOLLENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case has spawned procedural complexity, but
what is at stake here is not at all complex.
Nearly four years ago the Attorney General of the
United States objected under Section 5 of the Voting Rights
Act to South Carolina Act 1205, a 1972 enactment reapportioning
the South Carolina State Senate.
That enactment included three aspects which have
been hallmarks of discriminatory effects, namely, multimember districts, numbered seats and a majority run-off
requirement,
The Attorney General found that Act No. 1205 has
a clear and substantial racial effect.
Following the Attorney General9 s objection, South
Carolina never availed itself of the alternate pre-clearance
procedure open to it under Section 5, namely, a declaratory
action before a District Court in the District of Columbia.
Instead, the State has simply continued to give

effect to Act 1205 without Section 5 clearance.

And it is

that situation for which we seek redress here? the Court below
having refused our request for injunctive relief against
continued enforcement of the statute.
Basically, as we see it, we seek compliance by
South Carolina with the Voting Rights Act, compliance which
has generally been forthcoming in covered states.

Indeed,

South Ccirolina itself complied with the Voting Rights Act
in responding to an objection by the Attorney General to
its House of Representatives apportionment plan, and it
enacted a new plan which ultimately mat with approval.

So

that today the South Carolina House is apportioned in
accordance with the law; and today, in the South Carolina
House, there are a number of black members.

Today, in the

South Carolina Senate, there are no black members.
Now, the situation which I have described came
about, as a result of an error. the l egal error of the
Attorney General of the United States in 1972.

He first

declined to objection to Act 1205, not because he thought
the Act was valid, but because he thought he was compelled to
defer to a District Court judgment in South Carolina sustaining
the constitutionality of Act 1205 but disclaiming any
intention to pass on the validity of the Act under the Voting
Rights Act.
Now, I have referred rather flatly to this ruling

5

of the Attorney General as an error.

I do so because if

was determined to be an error in Harper against Levi, because
the United States has conceded the error both in this
Court and in the Court below.
QUESTION;
I suppose.

That determination isn't binding on us,

South Carolina wasn't a party to the litigation

in that case?
MR. WOLI.ENBERG:
QUESTION;

You're speaking of Harper v. Levi?

Right.

MR. WOLLENBERG:

The determination of Harper v.

Levi is not binding on this Court, your Honor, but we do
suggest in addition to arguing that the Harper and Levi
ruling was correct in determining that the limited reviewability
that took place here was proper.
We also argue, as an alternate ground, that the
Harper v. Levi Court, having jurisdiction to enter the
interlocutory orders that it issued, and the Attorney General's
time to object, having been tolled under those interlocutory
orders, the objection of the Attorney General was a valid
act.

And if it were ultimately determined that Harper v. Levi,

reached the wrong result, this would simply free the
Attorney General to withdraw his objection, but would not
nullify his objection nunc pro tunc.
QUESTION;
time to object

When you say that the Attorney Generale s

. was tolled by the Court orders, actually

6

the Court orders themselves were issued after the expiration of
the 60 day periodf were they not?
MB.. WOLLENBERG:
QUESTION:

We —

Can you answer that yes or no?

, MR. WOLLENBERG:

I can answer that it is our

position that they were not entered after the expiration of
the 60 day period.

It was the finding of the District Court
j

in the District of Columbia that they were not entered after
the expiration period.
I’m

speaking now of the preliminary order that was

entered by the District Court that extended the Attorney
General's power.
QUESTION:

But isn't it a fact that that order

itself was entered after the expiration of 60 days following
the submission of South Carolina's plan?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Your Honor, it is our position that:

it was not entered after the 60 days effectively began to run.
You will remember that this Court held in the Georgici case
that the Attorney General's regulations extending the
beginning of the 60 day period until he had complete information
on the submission before him was a valid exercise of authority
on his part.

And it was our contention in Harper which was

agreed to by the District Court, that the Attorney General’s
time for acting had been extended by him in connection with
requesting additional submissions up to June of 1972, so that

7
when we went before the District Court on August 10, 1972,
the 60 days had not expired.
We believe, if your Honor please, that that whole
60 day question is immaterial to the issues that are before
this Court.

But I'm —

QUESTION:

Well, what if you're wrong on that?

If

you say it’s .immaterial, you must mean that even if you’re
wrong on that, and the Attorney General's 60 day period had
expired before there was ever any Court order, you can
nonetheless prevail?
Is that right?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Precisely, your Honor.

Mow, the — I was saying why the Attorney General's
action was an error, and I had mentioned that it was held to
be an error in Harper v. Levi, and the United States has
now conceded in the Court below and in this case, it was an
error.
I also add that this Court's controlling subsequent
decisions, in Connor v. Waller and most recently , United
States against Board of Supervisors of Warren County, establish,
we think, that if anything the deferral should have gone in
the other direction.

In other words, the District Court

in South Carolina should not have been passing on the
constitutional

issue until the Attorney General had passed

on the Section 5 of the Voting Rights issue.

8

Now the Court below never reached this question.

The

Court below found that the Attorney General's ruling on Act
1205 was improperly reviewed in Harper against Levi.

And

on that premise, it treated the Attorney General’s definitive
objection to the statute as a nullity.
1 think the parties here, including the United States
which is here as amicus, are in agreement that the central
issue here is whether the Attorney General's initial
determination
/

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you just for a second?

Doss the full text of the letter of June 30f .1972,
a ppear in the papers before us anywhere?
I( know it's referred to as Exhibit 5 to the complaint,
but that wasn't reprinted.
MR. WOLIENBERG:

It appears at page Appendix 47,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Thank you very much.

MR. WOLIENBERG:

As I was indicating, the central

issue hare is reviewability.

If the limited reviewability

that we5re talking about hero, which is not 'reviewability on
the merits, it is not review of whether the Attorney General
should have found the Act. objectionable or not, but only
review of his legal statement that he was compelled not to enter
his own objection.
If it was reviewable as we contend, as the United

9
States agree, and as Harper v. Levi squarely held, then we
sufcm.lt the sole basis of the decision below is destroyed.
And I turn now to the limited reviewability issue.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with reference to your earlier
question, the reason that we regard the 60 days as immaterial
to the present case is that it is established law, we think,
under the Administrative Procedure Act, under this Court*s
decision in Dunlop, that — and the International Harvester
case which we cited in our brief, that where there is judicial,
review, the statutory period, which is created and imposed
on an administrative agency for its action is not governing
the Court in engaging in judicial review.
The present case is a perfect example of why that
has to be necessary.

If the Attorney General remains

silent until!. 11:00 o'clock on the night of the 60th
day, there would hardly be time for a judicial review.

If

there is judicial review, then the courts have uniformly
held that the power exists within a reasonable time after
the agency has committed the action complained of.

31.21

laches.

Now, in this case, there can be

no question of

Obviously, the case was brought

very quickly,

either just before the expiration cf the 60 days, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, or immediately after it, depending on how you
calculate the SO days.
timely fashion

In either case, it was brought in a

10
The reviewability, we think, is essentially
undebafcable.

The Administrative Procedures

Act was

designed to fill the interstices in statutes which created
review but which for some reason did not create review complete!
enough to deal with a critical situation.
And as the Court is well aware, there are three
well established exceptions stated in the Administrative
Procedures Act/ but none of them applies here.

One of them

is where Congress in so many words has precluded judicial
review.

Congress has simply said, of this particular

action, there will be no judicial review. Congress knows
that
exactly how to do that, and/Congress remembered how to do
it in this case is established by the
•''

fact that it used

j

that kind of language in Section 4 but did not use it in
Section 5.
7k second major area of exception is where the matter
is committed to agency discretion.

The action here of the

Attorney General is not in any sense committed to agency
discretion.

The Attorney General's own regulations recognizes!

that he acts in a quasi-judicial capacity, that he is in
effect acting to pass on a submission of a covered state
in lieu,

if he finds affirmatively, in lieu of the Three-

Judge Court.

His own regulations state that he will apply

the same standards that the Court does, and this court
reviewed his activities in that regard in the Georgia

11
case e and made clear its view that the Attorney General
does not act on a discretionary basis»
Finally, there is the recognition even by the
appellees that it is well settled -- I'm referring to their
note 68 in their brief at pages 37 and 38 — where appellees
say, the Courts may determine whether an official is acting
beyond the scope of his statutory authority, even in those
cases where they cannot review the manner in which ha exercises
his authority.
And. that, we suggest, is what occurred here in
substance»
Sc in sum, then, on the reviewability question,
wa submit that it is clear that Congress did not preclude
judicial review.

It is clear that the action involved was

not committed to agency discretion.

And finally, we think

it is clear that there is not an adequate remedy at law.
«SW-- J
.i

How, appellees —
QUESTION':

Mr. Wallenberg, may I give you a

hypothetical that's been troubling me as I think about this
ease?
Supposin g the Attorney General after 30 days had
run wrote a letter saying, my office is terribly busy, these
are awfully complicated matters? I don't have a big enough
staff to handle it, intelligently.
a letter.

Could that bs reviewed?

Therefore, I will not issue

12
MR. WOLLENBERG:

I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that that issue was considered in the Evers case, that a
District Court held that a failure to object on the
grounds that ha wasn't ready to decide whether to object
was not a valid ground? that it was reviewable? that this
Court never — as a Court, never reached the issue because
the appeal was dismissed for failure to perfect in time,
although I believe Mr. Justice Harlan
QUESTION;

If that kind of a disposition would be

reviewable, wouldn't that be a way in which he could get
additional time, to make such an announcement, have somebody
bring a suit saying you shouldn't

do it on that basis?

Then

he'd have all the time in the world to study the matter,
wouldn't ha?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Well, if your Honor please, I

think this Court upholding in Georgia the Attorney General
a xtending his own tirae beyond the 60 days literally stated
in the statute in order to get the full information he needs
already is something of an open Sesame for him to extend
a little.
QUESTION s

I see.

MR. WOLLENBERG;

But I think basically if you'll

consider the purpose of this provision for Attorney General
approval, it's prevision for approval of routine statutes
that don't raise serious questions, the State always has the

13
opportunity to go to the Three-Judge District Court in the
District of Columbia.

So that if the Attorney General for

,

some reason is not prepared to act promptly
always has the alternative remedy.

the state

And there5s no

suggestion, I think, that the Attorney General ever has or
ever would abuse that point.
QUESTION:

The Attorney General's always free to

simply say on the 60th day, I object, because your plan
doesn’t quite convince me — ask for more information»
MR, WOLIENBERG:
Honor.

I believe that to be true, your

I think that the particular formulation in Evers

suggested that he wasn't making the decision one way or the
other on the merits which the District Courts in Evers thought
he should make.
X was addressing the adequacy of the remedy at law,
or the adequacy of other remedies.

The appellees, and to some

degree, the Court below, have made a great deal of the
notion that really not having the Attorney General perform
his function really doesn't damage anyone, because Section 5
has reserved the rights of plaintiffs to go to Three-Judge
District Courts in the states, and pursue the matter under the
Fifteenth Amendment, so the fact that the Attorney General
has cleared the statute really doesn't hurt anyone.

And these

etherremedies are accurate.
The short answer to that we believe to be given

14
rather eloquently in the amicus brief for the United States
in this Court which we respectfully adopt in that respect.
And I would say here only that this kind of a defense
or this kind of an argument flies in the face of the whole
philosophy of the Voting Rights Act, which was adopted by
Congress, and upheld by this Court in South Carolina v,
Kafczenbach.
The Congress of the United States did not think that
the Fifteenth Amendment remedy that existed before theit and
still exists and ware preserved in the Act ware adequate.
why the Voting Rights Act.

That's

The Voting Rights Act placed the

burden on covered states? required them to show that their
new proposed legislation would not be discriminatory in
purpose or effect? and gave them an opportunity of getting
their clearance either in a District of Columbia court or
with the Attorney General.
If they can gat it with the Attorney General without
his performing his duty, then we submit that that destroys,
basically renders nugatory, the whole essential structure
of the Voting Rights Act.
QUESTION:

Would the plaintiffs in this case have

been limited in venue to the District Court of the District
of Columbia, or coaid they have brought suit anywhere?
MR. WOLLENBERG:
QUESTION s

The plaintiffs in Harper?

In Harper, yes

15
MR. WOLLENBERG:

1 think it is arguable, and.

persuasively so on the basis of legislative history, as the
government has indicated in its brief amicus to this Court,
that under the language of Section 14(b) of the Administrative
Procedure — excuse me, of the Voting Rights Act, that any
challenge of this sort would have had to have been brought in
the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

But of course you're — the Administrative

Procedure Act allows you to sue the Attorney General anywhere*
that either a plaintiff — plaintiff resides.
MR. WOLLENBERG:
closed question.

Yes, and I am not saying it is a

Ism saying that the Voting Rights Act,

Section 14(b), in indicating a venue directive for the
District of Columbia, might have been deeming to be
controlling, had a suit been brought against the Attorney
General elsewhere despite the Administrative Procedure
Act.

And it might have been argued, under kind of arguments

that prevails to some degree in the recent decision of this'
Court, in Sanders v. Califano, it might have been argued,
the Administrative Procedure Act doesn't creat substantive
jurisdiction and that the substantive jurisdictions that
ordinarily would prevail had been limited by 14(b) of the
Voting Rights Act.
1 think it5 s at least a grave question as to whether
it could have been brought anywhere else,

and it seems to

IS
me quite clear that it was highly appropriate to bring
it here»
QUESTIONS

Well, it certainly would be unusual if

it could be brought somehwere else, wouldn’t it?

If a

State is limited to the District of Columbia„ and yet the
plaintiffs in Harper v, Levi in a review of the Attorney
General’s action under the Administrative Procedure Act
could sue in any venue in the country.
MR» WOLLENBERGi

But your Honor, the symmetry

argument that has been made in the Court below and the
appellees I think doesn't fit this statutory scheme»
not a symmetrical statute.

And in view of the fact that Section 5 explicitly

continued to enforce the statute which we say has not been

cleared, the plaintiffs followed the only remedy available
to them, which was to bring a suit in a Three Judge District.
Court in South Carolina to enjoin it.
QUESTION:

I take it you say that a state law

would not be in effect during this review period?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Well, your Honor, I think that

the question of whether the law would go into effect in the
review period might depend on the procedures along the way.
I can conceive
QUESTION:

In any event, any court — I take it. you

say, could extend the time of the Attorney General.

And any

time they extended the time, it just hasn’t expired, and the
law hasn't con® into effect.
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Well, I think, your Honor, that a

cour t with jurisdiction, and assuming of course that the
action is brought properly, because I cannot conceived that
someone could come» along years later and attempt to stop
enforcement, but any court which had jurisdiction and
which issued an order extending the Attorney General's time
for objection I think would properly toll the enforceability
of the statute.

There was no effort made in the Harped

case to stop the landing election.

The statute has in fact

been enforced by the South Carolina -— first in the 1372
Senate election, and then in the 1976 Senate, ©lection.
QUESTION:

If the Attorney General says, 1 don't wait

18

any more time, I'm not going to object, may a court with
jurisdiction, as you say, extend his tin® at the suit of
some private party?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

We think, your Honor, that if there

is judicial review, it is clear that there has to be a power
in the Court, to grant effective relief.
QUESTION;

So your answer is yes, that the

state law would not be in effect throughout this review period
on appeal maybe to this court?
MR. WOLLENBERG;

Well, I think your Honor that I

hedged the smswer before by saying that it would depend
on the procedure.,

If no stay of the Act was asked, and if

the Act had gone into effect before the Court issued the
order extending the time for objection, then I assume that
the Act would stay in effect until litigation was
resolved, or until the stay order was issued.
If the objection was tolled while the 60 day period
had not been, completed, as we contend was the case hare,
then we would agree that properly the Act should not have
been given effect during that period.
QUESTION;
to go to the

If the Attorney — if the State chooses

Three-Judge Court in the District of Columbia,

what about intervention by private parties?

MR* WOLLENBERG;
parties

I assume that interested private

19
QUESTION:

Well, do you know, or has there been

law on it or not?
MR. WOLLENBEEG:

Yes, I'm informed there has been

intervention of private parties permitted, for example, in
the Richmond case.
QUESTION:

But when the State sues, the State just —

who's the defendant in that case?
MR. WOLLENBERG:
QUESTION:

The United States is the defendant.,

Not the Attorney General; just the

United States?
MR. WOLLENBERG:

Right.

In other words, the Attorney General's role is the
special role, created by the statute

,

and what we think ware

intended to be routine and easy cases, where the state
is saved the. difficulty and burden of going through a
whole court proceeding.
QUESTION:

How, your standard — your interest in

the case, I take it, is that you think the standards of the
Voting Rights Act are considerably different than the
constitutional standards?
MR. WOLLENBERG:
clear differences.

We think that there are certain

Perhaps the most significant, difference

is the burden of proof.

The State is required to come forward

and to establish that its law will not be discriminatory
in purpose or effect.

In a Fifteenth Amendmentcase the

20

plaintiffs have the burden of coming forward and establishing
a violation of at least effect and possibly also purpose.
And that difference in burden of proof is a very, very major
difference.
QUESTION:

x
Well, there's a difference in the

substantive standard, also, isn't there?
MR. WOLLENBERGs
QUESTION:
substantive standard?

I beg your pardon.

Isn't there a difference also in the
Doesnrt the Beer’s case indicate

that?
MR. WOLIENBERG:
yes.

I think that it does your Honor,

I think that the Voting Rights Act as part of

constitutional power
QUESTION:

It’s more difficult — in the matter, who

has the burden of proof.

The standard of the Voting Rights

Act has a more stringent standard than that of either the
Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, isn’t it?
/

MR. W0LL3NBERG:

■-.

I believe that it is, and I believe:

that ithas ~ that in upholding that Act, that this Court
has clearly recognised that Congress had power to implement
the Fifteenth Amendment by going somewhat beyond that.
1 should like, if I may, to reserve the rest of my
time for reply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Turner.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P, TURNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We believe that the petitioners should prevail
in this case because the Attorney General8s objection to
Act 1205 reapportioning the South Carolina State Senate
was a valid objection under the Voting Rights Act.
Although the Attorney General initially determined
himself to be without authority to express his independent
view that this act deluded minority voting rights because
of the Three-Judge- rapportiomnent court in the Twiggs case,
the matter was promptly brought to the attention of the
District Court for the District of Columbia which ordered the
Attorney General to use his discretion, and he did so.
Subsequent decisions of this Court confirm that the
District of Columbia courts in Harper were right, and that the
Attorney General's deferral policy was wrong.
The fundamental

question here then . is whether the

Attorney General * s•mistake of law was properly and
legally corrected by the Harper Court.

If so, the objection

stands and Act 1205 may not be implemented legally under
the Act? if not, the Court below was right, and its judgment
should be affirmed.
In the limited time available, I would like to address

22
the following issues: first, whether the Voting Rights
Act contemplates an independent review by the Attorney General,
of submitted legislative changes? secondly, whether the
Voting Rights Act properly construed permits the traditional
remedy in the nature of mandamus to compel the exercise of
administrative discretion; and third, whether relief such as
that granted by the Harper Court would be disruptive to the
administration of the Act.,
The independent review is contemplated by the Act,
we argue, because it is inherent in the statutory scheme
which Congress has provided us.

The Attorney General i3 a

substitute or surrogate for a declaratory judgment proceeding.
It's a quick 60 day review, but it’s a review on the merits.
Whether the Chance is discriminatory is the issue for the
Attorney General.
Certainly Congres? believed, and had the right
to believe, that the Attorney General would do some reviewing,
and not merely look at it or decide that he wasn't going to
review anything.

He was, after all, given the job to be a

surrogate for the District Court, for the District Court of —
for the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

what do you have to say, Hr. Turner,

about the 'argument advanced by your friends on the other
side of the table, at page 27 of their brief, that ona of
your predecessors testified before the Congress ~ I assume

23

the Judiciary Committee — asking for an amendment, first,
to give more time to the Attorney General under Section 5,
and second, to provide for judicial review?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

That ~
The Congress declined that invitation.

MR. TURNER:

That —- there are two comments

there, Mr. Chief Justice.
on the merits.

First, the proposal was for review

Here we are talking about a much more

limited kind of rev levy.

So I don't think the two proposals

are parallel.
And secondly. Congress rejected it, so it was not
passed, that the Attorney General's decision on the merits
should be reviewed.

And that, I again stress, is not what

we're talking about in this case.

We’re talking about very

limited mandamus t^ype review in the District Court for the
District of Columbia,
QUESTION:

But if I understand it, the essence of

your argument is that it?s reviewable because it was an
erroneous determination.

Does that not have something to do

with the merits?
MR. TURNER:

It has in this sense, your Honor,

that as we advised this Court in the Georgia litigation, if
you recall that, and footnote sis: in that opinion sets
forth how the Attorney General and the Courts were trying to
accomodate at the intersection of reapportionment.

24
litigation and Section 5 litigation.

And one of the policies

that we expressed at that time was one of deferral.

In our

brief —* in our brief in that case, we indicated that that
policy of deferral was under attack from Harper litigation.
Since then, the Harper litigation has decided that
that policy was wrong, and we were ordered to stop it.

And

this Court confirmed that judgment in Connor v. Waller, and
we now accept it.
We've always thought this multi-member system was
delusive and abridged minority voting rights.

We did not

express that opinion solely out of deference to the
Three-Judge Court in the Twiggs litigation.

That deference —

it turned out we were not only wrong, we were dead wrong.
The deference should have gone the other way, and in Waller
this Court said the District Courts, in that situation,
should defer to the Attorney General until his determination
has beer. made.
So that it's a basic mistake of lav? to defer, T
v ■

think, Mr. Justice, that we're talking about here? and not
review of particular decisions made by the Attorney General.
The record here indicates that this is

the only

case in which the Attorney General followed this policy of
deferral.

On page 31 of the Appendix, deposition of 'idle

chief of the voting section of the Civil Rights Division,
established that this Harper ease, or this South Carolina Act

25
1205 , is the only one in which that deferral policy, a very
short-lived policy, was followed»

So the case is one of a

kind»
The Voting Rights Act —■
QUESTION:

Well, I wonder why we granted certiorari.

MR. TURNER:

I think it important -— and I’m not

in a position to —
■

i.

QUESTION:

iv

No.

MR.- TURNER:

—- know why you accepted the appeal —

but I think it's important to establish whether or not there
is this limited kind of mandamus or arbitrary and capricious
review potential over the Attorney General's administration of
this Act.
The Harper suit was based on 28 U.S.C. 1361? that's
recited in the complaint and recited in the Court of Appeals’
opinion.

That very unequivocally gives the District Courts

jurisdiction to compel the performance of official duties
owed to the plaintiffs.
This kind of action has been described and recognised
in this Court’s ©pinions as "a familiar rule that a Court
may exercise its equity powers or equivalent mandamus powers
to comple courts, boards or officers to act in a matter
with respect to which they may have jurisdiction or authority",
although, to address your concern, Mr. Chief Justice, the
Court will not assume control os: guide the exercise of that

26
authority.

That’s out of Virginian Railway Co. and 300 U.S.
This is explicitly — this kind of review is ex­

plicitly recognised in the

Administrative Procedures Act?

Section 706(1), which says the reviewing court shall
compel agency action unlawfully withheld.
And courts require, as you know, convincing evidence
before that kind of review is withheld.
So unless the Voting Rights Act precludes such
relief, this rule ought to control this case, in our view.
And to address the venue question, I think 14(b) suggests
strongly that this District of Columbia Court was the only
one that had proper venue.
But we have found nothing either in the terms
of the Act or its purpose, or the legislative history, that
indicates a view that Congress intended to foreclose this
kind of limited review.

It5s true that a great amount of

discretion Is vested in the Attorney General.

But the

distinction is that mandamus compels him to exercise it, and
■ i

doesn 5fc tell him how.
QUESTIONS

Do you think, Mr. Turner, that if the

states submit a plan to the Attorney General, he rejects it,
objects to it in 60 days, than the state doesn’t bring any
suit in the District Court, it just kind of accepts the
Attorney General's rejection, that private plaintiffs in the
State could bring an action to review the Attorney General's

27
objection under the Administrative Procedures Act?
MR, TURNER:

I know of no precise authority or

precedent on that, Mr, Justice.

The nearest there has been

was an attempt by New York legislators to come to Washington
and seek relief from an objection that the Attorney General
had entered.

And the District Court for the District of

Columbia in that case indicated that they had no standing
to seek such relief.
That's as close as the hypothetically posed
has been addressed.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Turner* does the statute require the

Attorney General to give a statement of reasons for either
tn objection or a non-objection?

I know he does as a matter

of policy.
MR. TURNERS

He does as a matter of policy.

announced that policy in the guidelines,

He has

The statute does

not require it.
QUESTION:

If he

should change that policy, would

you say that the existences of review would compel him to
adopt the policy?
MR. TURNER:

I think it probably would.

I'm

thinking of the Badhows&i type litigation where — and
certainly under the Administrative Procedures — or, excuse
me, the Freedom of Information Act, this kind of information
underlying administrative rulings are available to the public

28
regardless of whether the attorney general announced or
didn’t announce this policy.
QUESTIGUs

If in his letter that he did write here*

instead of saying he was constrained to follow the ThreeJudge Court, if instead of that he had said, I think as a
matter of discretion it’s sound policy to do the same thing
the District Court did.
MR. TURNER:

Would that have teen reviewable?
If that was his independent judgment.

That's what we’re talking about here.
QUESTION:

Your position depended on a reading of

that letter that he felt
MR. TURNER:

Because we have —

legally bound to follow the —«

Well — and that’s correct,

tod

if you recall, Act 1205 was preceded by Act 932.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:
Act 1205.

Right.
Act 932 has the same features as

Act 932, the Attorney General objected to because

there was no intervening court decision.

When there was a

court decision, and we had gone down to South Carolina at
the court’s Invitation and told them of our view, and told
them of the basis for theofojecfcion, and the court re j a cted our
views, and said that there wasn’t any Fifteenth Amendment
violation here.

So we were right at the intersection that I

was trying to describe to the Chief Justice, where we had to
decide -whether to follow the court or to try to overrule the
court.

And we decided to try to follow it.

Later, under this

29
court2s rules, the precedents and —- whose to defer to whom —■
has bean made quite clear,

/hid we have no interest in

pursuing that further.
QUESTION s

May I repeat the question I thought

Mr. Justice Stevens was asking?
Let's assume that the Attorney General had written
a letter within the 60 day period in which in substance
he said., X think the reapportionraent plan fully comports with
the lav?.

You have my authority to proceed with it.

Is it

your contention that there would still be review by
these parties under the APA?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Your answer would be the same if the

Attorney General did nothing during the 60 days?
MR. TURNER:

That's — if he did nothing within

the 60 days, it depends why he did nothing.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he just said nothing, he

just let the 60 days go by —
MR. TURNER:

Well —

QUESTION: ~~ like an ordinary statute of 1 .imitations.
//

MR. TURNER:

The whole administrative practice under

this is to say something.

So it's very hard for me to copa

with a question that says the Attorney General stands mute.
We have a, whole section that analyzes each one of these
things as they coma in and reaches a determination on it.

30

1 suppose
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER i

But it could happen?
— if it fell iji somebody8 s

wastebasket on the first day that the submission came in and
was never picked up, and the 60 days expired, it might be a
more understandable hypothetical for us.

In that situation, I

think mandamus would lie because the Attorney General had
not done the kind of independent review that Congress
envisioned in the statute.

And I hope that that cones

closer.
QUESTIONs

Let's take another hypothetical.

Suppose

the Attorney General had ruled in favor of Harper plaintiffs
originally within the 60 day period.

I agree that the State

of South Carolina would have had no remedy other than as
described by the Act to come before a Three Judge Court in
the District.

Let's assume that, say a State Senator from

South Carolina whc would lose his seat decided that the
Attorney General bad made a gross error of law.

Would he have

the same right that Mr. Harper had to institute an action under
the Administrative Procedure Act, challenging the Attorney
General*s decision on a legal ground?
MR. TURNER?

The — it seems to me that if the

objection was made for a very fundamentally wrong reason, I
mean, like we have in this case, where the Attorney General
m istakenly thought himself without authority to rule, if

31
somehow a basic mistake such as that resulted in objection,
and the person injured by the Attorney General9s failure to do
his duty, I think, would have the same kind of limited
restricted review that we’re talking about in this case.
QUESTION?
period of limitation?
MR.' TURNERS

390

Would that right be limited by any
Could it have been brought a year latear?
I think the normal rule of laches

has to apply here, and I can’t probe the outer limits of that,
because this was filed within 30 days of even the day the 60
days expired, if it expired.
QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, can I just ask one more question

because Mr. Justice Powell followed up on a thought that I
had.

You answered by saying that if the letter by the

Attorney General said, I am not going to object because X
find that the plan is lawful in all respects, that would not
be reviewable, I understood you to say.

What if he made

a clear:, error of law, and he was wrong.

Somebody came in and

said, legally your answer was just dead wrong, as it was
here.

Why would that be different?
MR. TURNER:

It’s different because of the distinction

we see in the cases dealing with mandamus, where they say the
issue is whether the discretion has been exercised -QUESTION:

But the question of whether it’s lawful

or unlawful isn't a question of discretion, is it?
MR. TURNER?

No, and that's what we're saying.

32
This is a threshold kind of thing.

The Attorney

General said,, I have no discretion to review this* in effect.
Because of —
QUESTIONS

Well* he says* I have discretion to review

it? I’ve reviewed it* and I find that it’s lawful.
MR. TURNER:

Then I think that’s the discretion that

Congress gave him., and it ought to stand.
QUESTIONs

Even though he's made a plainly erroneous

ruling of law.
MR. TURNER:

If that was shown* I still think in that

case Congress has presumed that the Attorney General is going
to exercise his discretion* he will exercise it correctly* and
in those few cases where he doesn't exercise it correctly* the
constitutional litigation is the proper remedy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well* Mr. Turner.

Mr. Bell* we'll at least let you tell us what you're
going to tell us tomorrow morning.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL T. BELL* ESQ.*
ON*BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.
MR. BELLs

It looks as though I'll

haveto save

most of my argument until then* Mr. Chief Justice.

And if

it please the Court* I think that perhaps in the short time I
have allotted -- I'm sorry* perhaps I misunderstood you, do
you wish me to proceed for five minutes?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Oh, yes, yes.

33

MR. BELLs

Perhaps that time could be most profitably

used in answering some questions that have been posed while
they're fresh on the minds of the Court.
We find it very puzsling that the — United States
taking some of the positions it has taken here this
afternoon, because the opposite positions are being taken
in other litigation at this time, or have been taken since
the Harper two case was decided.
For example, the question of whether a mistake of law
is reviewable was presented in a case called Harris v. the
United States here in the District of Columbia District
Court? that case is reported in 415 Federal Supplement.
And the Attorney General in that case, v?hich is a post-Waller
case, took exactly the opposite position.

Several questions

were raised as to whether he had committed fundamental
errors of law.

Among the allegations were that he had

addressed himself to the question of the one-person-ana-vote
standard in a Section 5 review.

It was claimed that Section

5 does not authorize him to get into the one-person-one-vote
standard of the Fourteenth Amendment —
QUESTIONS

Does that involve the threshold question

of the reviewability of his failure to object?
MR. BELL:

It involved the question of his

withdrawing an objection.

And the basic claim being made by

the plaintiffs, Mr. Justice Stewart, was that he'd withdrawn

34
an objection with no new evidence being placed before him.
QUESTIONS
that was reviewable?
MR. BELLS
which was presented.

Welly was there any question as to- whether
His withdrawn -Yes* that was the thrashhold question
The Attorney General said, no, this is

not reviewable? the position we5re taking in this case.

The

court found against him in part, citing Harper v. Levi, and
for hint in part.

But we see no distinction between the questions

raised in Harris, and the kind of question that was raised in
Harper v. Levi.

We do see an inconsistency of position.

Now, I also understood Mr. Turner to say that if an
objection is fundamentally wrong, an objection, the opposite
case from Harper v. Levi where the Attorney General said, no
o bjaction, but if an objection is fundamentally wrong, I
understood him to say that, yes, in that case, private parties!
could seek review of that.
Now, of course, the same judge that ruled against the
Attorney General on that issue in Harper v. Levi found the
other way when that case was presented in Griffith.
But baycnd that, in a case called Robinson v.
Pottingar, we find that the Attorney General took the
opposite position on that as well.

There, some officials

in Montgomery, Alabama were again raising some of these
questions,

He said in that case, we canEt even be made

parties to this suit? that9s how immune we are from court

35
review? ranch less getting into these questions»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We’ll resume there

at 10?00 o'clock tomorrow morning.
[Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock, p.m.

, the Court was

recessed, to reconvene at 10:00 o’clock, a.m., Tuesday,
