The hr.

;v in the event of default,

was rriginally ma.da in >-<.y of 1973 end

originally mature .. m hy of 1974.
However, at the bonrror's request, three different
e> tensions of the maturity late were granted, the last of
which exp:.red in July, 1975.
In August of 1975, the bank determined that the loan
was in default and in September, 1975, the bank gate the
requisite notice of foreclosure.
The process

of foreclosure in Tennessee is an exer­

cise or private contractual right and is not accomplished

4
through judicial means»
After the notice of foreclosure was given, the
Respondents filed this action in the Tennessee Chancery Court,
seeking to enjoin the foreclosure»

The Chancellor granted a

temporary injunction restraining the bank from foreclosure.
The bank then moved to dissolve the temporary injunc­
tion relying on the provisions of 12 United States Code Section
91.

The Chancellor granted that motion, holding that Section

91 of the Banking Act forbids a Tennessee Court from enjoining
a national ban?t prior to foreclosure.
Respondents filed, an interlocutory appeal to the
Tennessee Supreme Court which, in its decision, judicially
created an. exception to the anti-injunction proviso of Section
91.
The Tennessee Supreme Court held that the anti­
injunction proviso does not. apply where a bank's debtor is
seeking to restrain a foreclosure.
The structure of my argument will be, first, to
examine the grammatical and historical meaning of the antiinjunction proviso in Section 91, then the decisions of this
Court and the State Court decisions and having done that, to
exploro whether, under the circumstances present in this case,
there is any constitutional impediment to its historic and
natural construction„
QUESTIONS

Will you somewhere along the line answer

5

this question ano' that is, whether Respondent Impac, instead
of being

%

mortgagee, had simply owned a piece of land and

your client sent out a bulldozer and started excavating on the
land and the Respondent objected and your client said, "We are
starting our new branch office here," and the Respondent said,
"Well, gee, 1 never sold it to you," and it turned out to be
simply a mistake in identity on the part of your client.
Would the Tennessee courts be disabled by the section
you rely on from issuing an injunction in that situation?
MR. KANADAY:

Well, clearly, under -che decision of

the Supreme Court in this case, they would not be disabled.
QUESTION:
MR. KANADAY:

Wall, under your theory, would they be?
Under our theory I do not know because

in the .Instance that you posit tc me, the

bank is acting .on •

its own initiative without reliance on any contractual rights.
In this instance we are relying on our rights in the
contract in the deed of trust so I do not know.

It might be

stretched that far.
QUESTION *

You say, then, it is simply literally no
are
injunction in whatever circumstances yCscnceivable? At least,
you say it could be pressed that way.
MR. KANADAY*

Yes, sir.

This Court ir 1383, whan it

decided the case of Pacific Rational ?5ank versus Mister, said
that it was an absolute prohibition and that the remedy

— and

that was. an attachment case and not an injunction case but I

6
don't think that is important.
QUESTION:
couldn't it?

Well, but it could be quite important,

Because if you read the section of the statute

you are relying on as a astern generous type of thing, attachmar : and execution are both remedies prior to judgment initia­
ted by a plaintiff and certainly you could read the word
injunction as being so limited,
MR,. KANADAY:

I don't understand the limitation that

is implied by reference to the attachment.

The bank is rely­

ing on the latter part of Section 91 •which provides, "Ho
attachment, injunction or execution shall be issued against
such arse station or its property before final judgment in any
suit,

-t on or proceeding in any state, county or municipal

court."
QUESTION:
in the e&

Do you have to go as far as was suggested

of the bulldozer mistakenly on the wrong property?
bo yon have to say this statute would go that far in

order

o support your position?
MR. KANADAYs
QUESTION:

No, sir, we do not»

We do not.

You have business relationships and lusi-

ees?,-i transactions and documents from which you are proceeding
as distinguished from the ocher which is a trespass, I would
take it.
MR. KANADAY:
•

Precisely,

That is what I have tried

respond, that we ware relying or private contractual rights

7
between the lender and the borrower that define the nature of
the relationship and the rights on the happening of certain
events rather than a unilateral action on the part of the bank.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kanaday, what in the statute draws a

distinctim between a breech of contract claim and a tort claim?
There is nothing in the statute —
MR. KANADAY:

There is nothing in the plain reading

of the statute that draws such a distinction.

But I don't

think that we have to embrace such an egregious position.
QUESTION:

No, no, but if y^u concede that the

statute does not apply literally in that situation, are you not
saying that in soma cases it is read literally and in some
cases it is not?
MR. KANADAY:

justice Stevens, I am not saying that

I co... cede how the statute would be read under those extreme
cases.

1 am saying that important distinctions can be made,,

I don't know how the statute is read.
QUESTION:

Well, if one could distinguish between

tort and contract, could one also not distinguish, as your
oppeteret does, between cases in which the plaintiff is a
creditor and those in which he is a debtor?
MR. KANADAY:

Yes.

But I am not saying that the

statute affords us the liberty to make those distinctions,
either between tort, contract, debtor, creditor.

X am relying

on the facts of this case where there is a private contractual

e
right that there is an absolute prohibition under the statute
from the interference prior to final judgment,
If there is any confusion about the proper construefcion of anti-in junction proviso,, it arises because in its
present form. Section 91 is an amalgam of two unrelated sta­
tutes,

The first portion of the statute voids preferential

transfers of property by insolvent national banks.
The second portion of Section 91 prohibits the state
court from issuing attachments, injunctions and executions
sgains; a national

bank prior to final judgment.

The issue in this case of course is whether a state
court can issue an injunction against a national bank from fore­
closing 01 collateral prior to final judgment.
Now, because of the holding of the Tennessee Supreme
:t, I -chink another way of stating. the issue istwhether the
'i vli:
, i’’ -"
•V

preced ing language relating to preferential transfer

in w*

manner docs restrict the otherwise unqualified meaning and
unqualified language of the anti-injunction proviso„
Until 1864, a national bank could not even be sued
in the state courts,

in that year, a statute was -.adopted
‘ {

aff >rdlng jurisdiction in actions against national--.;6anks in a
■'hi,

state court.
In 1373, the Congress adopted the anti-injunction
proviso as a limitation upon the jurisdiction of state courts
to grant certain types of remedy at certain stages'of the

9

litigation in the state court proceedings.
Now, in 1973, there was a revision of the banking
and the judiciary code and as a result of this revision, there
was an inadvertent deletion of the anti-injunction proviso and
it was left out of the code for come two years by mere inad­
vertence .
Then in 1875, there was another revision of the code
and the anti-injunction proviso reappeared without explanation
at the end of the section which voided preferential transfers
by insolvent national banks and it has remained in that posi­
tion through the present day.
'It was in that position when this Court issued its
decisions in Mixter, Van Reed and Earle»
Tine Tennessee Supreme Court reached the result that
it did by taking the erroneous view that "We looked to the
purpose of the statute, which was to secure the

assets of a

bank, wnerher solvent or insolvent, for ratable distribution
among its general creditors."
We say that was not the purpose of the statute.
The clear purpose was to limit the jurisdiction of the state
courts to grant extraordinary remedies at a certain stage in
the proceeding.

It was a limitation on the jurisdiction grant

of the 1364 statute.
The first case that this Court has decided on it
was Mixter.

10

Now, Pacific National Bank of Boston versus Hlxter
which, in 1888, held that the anti-injunction proviso nullified
an attachment which had been obtained by a creditor of a
national bank against funds of that bank on deposit in another
bank.
The Court clearly, rejected the argument that the
anti-injunction proviso of Section 91 is somehow limited by
its preceding provisions voiding preferential transfers.

The

Court said, ’"As it stood originally as part of Section 57
after 1871 and as it stands now in the revised statutes, it
operates as a prohibition upon ail attachments against national
banks under the authority of the state court,w
The form of its reenactment in the revised .statute
does rvc change its meaning in this particular.

All attachment,

laws of this state must be read as if they contained in express
terms that they were not able to apply to suits against the
national tank.

The remedy is taken away altogether and cannot

foa used under any circumstances and it was further said that
if the pot:nr of issuing attachments has bean taken away from
the state courts, so also is the power of issuing injunctions.
That is true,

Now, that was this Court’s unanimous

construction of the statute in 1888,
The Mixfcer case then was followed by the case of
Earle versus State of Pennsylvania,

In that case, a creditor

of a bank customer sought to reach funds on deposit in the bank.

11
The bank claimed no interest in the funds and was a mere stake­
holder.

This Court concluded that this was not an action

against a bank or its property rights.
It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court in
the Earle decision dissolved tbs attachment against stocks
•the bank held as collateral for a loan of that customer.

But

unhappily, we don't have a statement of the reasoning of the
Court in doing this.
Presumably, it was because c:c the applicability of
the anti-injunction provis o„
The present case is clearly not within the ambit of
the exception in the Earle case, for in the present case the
proceeding is brought by the Respondents against the National
Funk as aaw»d party defendant and obviously, the injunction
hic'h they seek would materially affect the

bank * s property

rights in its collateral.
The final decision was in 1905 in Van Reed versus
People's Watlcraf Bank, which reaffirmed the hording of Mister:
: ‘r

again, an attachment case.
Yes, sir?

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Was there any constitutional issue pre­

sented in the courts below?
MR. KANADAY:

Justice White, there was no constitu­

tional issue presented in this case, at air until after I filed
my brief

raised in the Respondent’s —

QUESTION:

No, sir, I do not think that it is even

QUESTIONs

Why?

MR. KANABAY;

Because in the case of Cardinari.e versus

Louisiana, a unanimous decision which you wrote, you wrote
this way, "The Court has consistently refused to decide federal
constitutional issues raised here for the first time on review
of state court decisions0E!

Co you think that is a jurisdictional

The case is properly here, isn't it?
MR. KANADAY:

And your question is what?

Weil, is the Respondent privileged to

MR. KANABAY:

No, sir, I do not think so.

One, for the reason that you stated in the Cardinale
decision.

You noted not only the jurisdictional considerations

incident to that rule, but you also noted the policy reasons
incident to judicial administration.
You said questions not raised below are those bn
which the record is very likely to be inadequate since it
certainly was not compiled with those questions in mind.
Now, apart from tills, relative to appropriateness in
this ease, 2 think there is another result of the failure to

15
raise the question in timely fashion and that is a plain
waiver of constitutional rights, which either party can do in
any civil or criminal litigation by not having raised it in
the trial court, not having raised it in the state supreme
court and it is obvious that it was not raised in those pro­
ceedings aecause the state court opinion clearly said — and
I agreed with it at the time on this one point, that there was
no jurisdiction in any other forum and they devote a portion
of the decision to a holding that the rase could not be brought
in the federal district court which was true, as we understood
the case at that time, thinking it was strictly a federal
statue :.ry construction casa»

MR. KAMADAY:

Your Honor, I have seen both types of

There v.as plenty of both types of actions.

And the reason

chat so many of the actions are brought after foreclosure is

uo.

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. KANADAY:

Counsel, you may continue.

Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrs. Pigg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. GAIL P. PIGG
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MRS. PIGG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
Petitioner propounds the theory that the courts of
our land cannot interfere by injunctive relief to protect the
citizens of our land from wrongful foreclosure of their pro-

party by a National Bank until a final hearing at which time,
I s irmit, the damage is done.
Q0E3TIGN s

The —

What do you think the statute means and

what is its purpose?
MRS. PIGGs

Your Honor, 1 think that the statute

clearly on its face means that its purpose is to protect
creditors for ratable distribution among its creditors.
The statute defines — it is self-defining in. that
the hei dir.g of it regulates transfers by banks and .other acts
in contemplation of insolvency.

It goes further after that

heading arid it prohibits transfers, assignments, payments of

money committed after an act of insolvency or in contemplation

18

thereof with a view to prevent the application of the bank’s
•
\
assets in accord with the National Banking Act and with a view
to prefer one creditor over another.
Then, your Honor, it has a semicolon and it says,
"And no attachment — no injunction, attachment or garnishment
will issue against any bank.'1

In that case, it says "Against

any state bank pending a final hearing."
It says also"against the bank or its assets" and I
submit that that is an important clause.
But Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit that it
is free aid clear of ambiguity that you cannot pull the last
clause of that.

That entire statute is one sentence.

I

submit that you cannot pull the last clause and apply it to
wherever it is that you want to apply it.
I submit that this is good law md I would like to
say initially that I do not argue with it — that Respondent
does not argue with that law but the Petitioner goes further
and says chat this Court has ru .ed three times that the? courts
cannot interfere with national banks to protect the assets of
its debtor pending a final hearing — always pending a final
hearing.
Now, I submit that these cases did not hold that.
I would like to take a very gaick look at Mjb:ter.
Mixter was decided by Chief Justice White — or Mixter was an
opinion written by Chief Justice White in 1808.

IS
In that particular case, the bank owed Mixter

$15,000c

Mixter began a suit by attachment.
How, the bank was not insolvent on the date,

apparently, that that attachment issued but just prior thereto,
it closed its doors, then it resumed business.
During the

resumption of business, the attachment

issued.
Wow, 1' would like to say to the Court that in the
Mixtax case, I felt that there must be a typographical error
because the year was one year preceding the period of time
that is involved and i -chink when *' a court reads that case it
will S'.-.;a what 1 mean.

1

Nevertheless, the bank was in severe financial
difficulty at that period of-time.

This would bet;I think, the

obvious reason why the Court extended or appeared to extend
'..tu statute -co mean that the bank did not have to be insolvent.
Tuft Earle case decided by the Court and written in

;;I
the opinion tveitten by Justice Harlan in 1900 did hot go that
far.

This was a case in which one Mr. Long, as I recall, had

a judge.cut against — had a judgment for some $31,000.

An attachment isseed by garnishment and the court
in fhar. instance held that this last clause related back to
the rest of the section.
How, it also in that instance went on to say that
this was not an assat of the bank but nevertheless it clearly

20
allowed the attachment by garnishment to stand.
There has been another case which is the Van Reed
decision written by Mr. Justice Day in i&OS and this case was
another simple attachment by a creditor in which event the
court related back to the Mixter case and extended the statute
to apply beyond insolvency but I submit to the Court that these
banks clearly protect — or these cases clearly protect the
bank against interference of its assets by creditors.
QUESTION:
bank.

They —>

In these cases they were creditors of the

Is that it?
MRS* PIGGs

Yes, sir, they were creditors of the

bank, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:
MRS * PIGG:

In all three cases*
And none of these cases, and it is al1
•b

most frightening to me that the extension — that they have
been extended this far — none of these cases stands for the
proposition, none of these cases had before it the ;question as
to whether the bank could wrongfully take.away the assets

of

the debtor's property or the assets of one of it's debtors, not.
a single one and I submit that neither of these cases stands
for that proposition.
I have alluded, I think, to the fact that property
held ss security under a deed of trust in Tennessee is not
owned by the bank and X would like to lock to Tenness se law on
that point for a moment.

21
And this is all supported. of course, in my brief,
but the mortgagee is clearly a creditor.
the property is as security.

His only interest in

He is not deemed to be a property

owner.
The Court has clearly held and this was, 1 think, in
a 1955 Supreme Court case, that legal title vests in the
trustee and this has been the holding in -chat state for the
last many, many years, certainly since the turn of the century,
QUESTION:
HRS, PIGG:

And who is the trustee in this ease?
The trustee in -this case — X believe

now is hr, Kanaday,
But the trustee, four to•

the lender.

ike

I know of

The trust2... is simply selected by
'M

QUESTION:

Doesn't the mortgagee have an equitable

interest in the property?
MRS, PIGGs

Your Honor, certainly the mortgagee has

an interest from the standpoint of his security interest.

He

has, and we get into a situation here where it becomes shaded.
Once the property is

sold to a bona fide purchaser — I'll

get back to ycir, to answer your question in just a moment —
bat once the property la sold to a bona fide purchaser, contrsry to what Petitioner says, that property under Tennessee
law is gone.

It is beyond the reach of that mortgagor.

22
Now, that is assuming that it is a bona fide pur­
chaser, of course.

But the trustee has only such power as he

is granted in that deed of trust.
Mow, the serious question becomes *— the serious
question throughout this entire matter becomes who determines
default?
In the event there is no default, the trustee has
no power and it is a dry trust*

Thera are cases, again,

throughout our state that state just exactly that and I would
like to point out that the Jones case that is cited in. my
brief on page 14 states that the property cannot foe recovered
and in that instance there was a fradulent sale, an actual
sale whereby the mortgagee fraudulently took the property back
and then sold it to a bona fide purchaser and the court held
that the Petitioner could only recover —- or the Plaintiff in
that case could only recover damages.
QUESTION:

What did the deed of trust say in this

case?
MRS. PXGG:

Your Honor, the deed of trust in this

instance was used or was a very standard form.
QUESTIONs

Well, whatever it was, however standard

it was, what, did it say about the mortgagee's privileges to
declare a default?
HIS. Vl&Sr.

In the event of default, he can advertise

‘■'or 20 or 21 consecutive days — three consecutive weeks and

23
this is stated but there is nothing in the deed of trust that
tells how one determines default.

There is no waiver in the

deed or trust by that mortgagor,
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't a person declaring a default

do so at his own peril if he is mistaken?
MRS, PIGG:

Your Honor, he does so at his own peril —

and forgive me, Mr, Chief Justice -*•
QUESTION:

In any situation where the -power to de­

clare a default is vested in one person,
MRS. PIGG:

That is not the question before this

Court, with the permission of the Court.
QUESTION:

The question is —

Well, tell me the answer to my question

c- id then we will see if it fits in,
MRS, PIGG:

Yes, I would have to agree that he does

tion, what is his peril?
owner?

Vihai: is the remedy of the . property

The remedy of the property owner — first of all,

Tennessee ocas have the right of equity of redemption but it
is

notice and protest.

He has

What can ho do?

He has waiver demand,

waived the equity of redemption.
There is only one thing that he

24
could do if the theory of Petitioner were accepted.
He could — Petitioner says that he can recover the
property.

This is error.

He can recover the property if the

mortgagee is the successful bidder and retains the property.
Then he could, I am confident, recover the property under
Tennessee law but if the mortgagee is not the successful
bidder he cannot recover the property as previously stated.
All rightf his next remedy then, and Petitioner
would delegate him to the second-best remedy.

He has only one

other, and that is to recover damages.
And I submit to the Court that to recover damages
in this instance is not sufficient.

Damages are simply inade­

quate and I would turn the attention of the Court to the fact
that the Chancellor in the first hearing of the matter, before
this question arose, before the question of jurisdiction, did
find that irreparable damages'

wourd

occur if foreclosure

were

permitted to be had prior to a final hearing.
And then, of course, when this question arose,

he

dissolved the injunction, only for it to be reinstated by the
Tennessee Supreme Court.
1 submit to the Court that beyond the inadequacy of
the damages, that the legal fees that would be involved in
seeking that final redress would be impossible, absolutely
impossible for most people.
■?e are not dealing here only with business, hard core

25
commercially-priented people.

We are dealing here with

literally hundreds of thousands of home loans, home improve­
ment loans, of automobile loans, office loans — every kind of
loan and in each one of those instances,

Petitioner stands

before the court and says that you cannot interfere if they
wroncrfulxy foreclose.
QUESTION:

We are only concerned in this case with

the stau ce involving national banks, as I understand it.
MRS. PIGG:

This is true, Your Hosier.

And I am

referring axways, throughout my argumen , onAy to national
banks.

When I state that we are concerned, they have mortgage

loans and we are concerned with these type loans.
QUESTION;

1 think \

made tbs statement, if I

understood i ou edrrett^y , that nothing in tl .• dead of trust
had indicated what c; sfcituted an event of default.
hRS,. PIGG:

No, sir, this was not — 2'm sorry,

four Honor, :.f I misled.

There are certain things thr

obviously constitute default.,
QUESTION:

It sets forth a long list of things that

constitute default,
. PIGG:

Certainly, one of them bei-ncr nonpayment,

one of them being a question of whether the property has beer,
damaged or taxes have been paid or insurance kept in force <snci
effect.

Those are just some of those.

But I am talking abort,

when I responded to the question earlier, I am talking about

26

who will make. that 'determination?
Let me take the example of a case that I have simply
followed throughout my brief and refer to now.

Take the sit­

uation of a man who pays the account and it gets wrongfully
credited to someone else's account.
no protest.

No demand, no notice,

He does not have to be criven this,

Advertisement is held for three consecutive weeks
and if he is fortunate enough and finds that in the newspaper,
which is a legal publication, from that point he immediately
tries to stop that sale,
Tennessee law, as Mr, Kanaday stated to the Court
earlier, has a five-day notice requirement.

You must give the

mortgagee five days' notice before an injunction can be had.
Or there it can be had, actually.
so the oppressed party — and I will call him the
oppressed party at this point because I feel that he is ~~ re
attempts to stop the sale and applies to the court"of injunc­
tive relief and the court says to that citizen, "We cannot
help you.

The courts do not have power over the banks to stop

your property from being sold.

We can help you only after the

act is done and we will try to help you recover damages”
I submit to the Court that this is at the point of
taking.

This is — it becomes questionable as to whether

there is a violation of due process of the Fifth Amendment
of that individual.

27

Now, I want to quickly respond to a question that
was asked of Petitioner earlier and that is that T do not
attack the statute as unconstitutional because not for one
moment do I conceive that either Congress or this Honorable
Court ever would allow any bank anywhere to stand in the shoes
of the Court and make a determination as to whether a ran,
in face, is in default or not.
So

certainly do not attack it as constitutional.

1’ say only r.hat if the construction were accepted which
Petitione., propounds, that it would render it unconstitucion?,

and that is the on.>.y way that 1 enter that argument.
QUESTION:

constitutional argument as a guidance to statutory construc­
tion which we are free to consider along with all the other
statutory guidelines.
MRS. PIGG:

Your Honor, this is correct.

This is

precisely what I am doing.
QUESTION:

Which?

which is precisely what you are

doing?
MRS, PIGG;

Submitting it as the construction, as

a part of determining the statute.

I do not attack the sta­

tute as unconstitutional and I never have.
QUESTION:

Ho if we disagree with you on the con­

struction of the statute, you do not expect us, then, to
reach any constitutional argument?
iRE. PIGG:

Well, obviously not,

I mean, this an

argument from my standpoint.
QJE.8TI.0N:
MRS. PIGG;

That is all I needed to know.
And — well, I'll proceed from there but

I would submit to the Court that there is an additional situa­
tion here.

Whereas the man who has the example that I pro­

posed of the man who has lost his house goes back into the
same courtroom with the mail next door who did not his loan
with a national bank and the court says, he can grant an in­
junction insofar as a savings and loan or an insurance company,
but not as to a national bank.

29

What is the feelinq of the individual at that point
as to who makes the determination of default?
feelinq as to due process?

What is his

Has he had a hearing?

1 submit to the Court that he has not had a hearing.
He has simply lost the property prior to the time of taking.
I would also go back and cite Mr. Justice Stewart
in

r.

.3

?gentes casti because the language is far better than I

could say it, in that if the right to notice and a hearing is
l.o serve its full purpose, it roust be granted at a time when
the deprivation can still be prevented, that this Court aoes
not embrace the proposition that the wrong can be done if it
can ba undone.
1 submit, first of all, that the wrong cannot be
undone biz; if it could, that that does not relieve the fact
uhav. the oppressed citizen has still lost his property.
the xtrc.vg was done at that period of time.
There arc three major points that I state here.
First of all, that the statute on its face is free .of ambi­
guity.

Second, that the property is not an asset of the bank.

It is still art asset of the citizen.

Third, that the cons­

truction they seek would render it in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.
X submit to the Court somewhere in Petitioner’s
brief

they

have stated that the wheels of business must

continue to run.

30
1 state that the wheels of business must give way
and let the courts determine if there is default»
First of all, now, there is nothing here which would
f
interfere with the bank’s rights, ultimately.
If there; is a
hearing under the foreclosure injunction statutes which we
have, if there is a hearing, •‘hen it will be determined at
that: time whether there is possible or possibly irreparable
damages.
From that point there will be a hearing.
If the court finds at that time that there are no
irreparable damages in the picture i i no showing of irrepar­
able damages, than there will not be an injunction granted.
There is only a determination to bo made as to whether there
are irreparable damages and whether the bank, in fact,

has a

right to foreclose.
QUEST!

N:

Mrs. Pigg,

did

you argue in'the Supreme

Court or Ternus»s»«e litae to construe this statute against, you
ocild be to impinge upon your constitutional right of cue
process of law?
MRS. PIGG:
QUESTION:
MRS. PIGG:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I did n,t,
You did not make that argument?
No, sir, I did net.

I would state to

the Court that I do follow Rule 40 of the Supreme Court rules
in chat the statement of a .:!uestlcn presented will be deemed
to include every subsidiary question fairly presented therein

31
and I do feel that this is a question fairly presented under
the issue,
If

it please the Court, I think the issue is

obvious and I think that, it really is quite a simple issue.
The Tennessee Supreme Court did not accept Petitioner's theory
that the Tennessee courts could not protect citizens* proper­
ties from wrongful

foreclosure,

I submit that that Court gave that decision, contrary
to Petitioner's statement in his brief, a very thorough examin­
ation and very thorough consideration and that it is certainly
in the interest of public policy alone, if not simply to mis­
construe a statute, that the State of Tennessee, the Supreme
Court of Tennessee, be uphexd in its decision.
Thank you. Your Honor.
ME:. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Kanaday?
ME, KANADAY:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. KANADAY, JR., ESQ.
ME, KANADAY:

If, as the Tennessee Supreme Court

held, and if, as the Respondent urges on this Court, the pro­
hibition against the issuing of injunctions, is somehow con­
stricted by the preceding language in Section 91 relating to
preferential transfers to conditions of insolvent banks, to
the securing of banks’ assets for ratable distributions among
the creditors, then this Court will, find it necessary to

32

ignore the statutory context in which the anti-injunction
proviso was adopted and that was, as an amendment to the sta­
tute conferring jurisdiction on state courts to hear actions
against national banks.
it will not only be necessary to ignore the context
of its enactment, it will be necessary to ignore the decision
of this Court in the Van Reed case.
While in the Mixter case» as Mrs. Pigg stated» there
was no insolvency in the bank at the time that the attachment
arose» it did become insolvent.
But the Van Reed decision dispelled any notion that
the application of the anti-injunction proviso

is in any wise

limited by the state of the solvency of the bank in question
or the s • curing of assets for ratable distribution to i ts
creditors.* and they make that quite explicit in the Van Reed
opinion.

Thera is no intimation that the bank in•Van Reed

was insolvent or was- having financial difficulties or had
committed preferential transfers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kan&day, in the jurisdiction where I

practiced for 16 years, the statutes provide there- could be no
foreclosure of a mortgage without judicial action and in a
judicial action such as was provided by the laws of Arizona»
a mortgagor or debtor could raise any of the issues which your
opponent has tried to raise here and, the court simply would
rot grant foreclosure until, it had had a hearing on those

33
issues.
'Mow, I take it there is nothing in that statutory
procedure that would violate what you refer to as the anti­
in j un ction provisions?
MR, KANADAY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor, al­

though 1 am not intimately acquainted with that process.
QUESTION:

Well, then, wouldn't it make some sense

to construe the injunction language, as I suggested earlier,
as being the same sort of injunction or the kind of injunction
that you would think or in connection with attachments ana
execution.-- — that is, what a plaintiff-creditor could get
against a bank?
MR,, KANADAl;

No, sir, 1 don’t think so.

One, because it is an absolute, unconditional, un­
qualified prohibition in its express terms.

The type of fore­

closure that Tennessee has under its deads of trust is the
type that it has had. since 1796 when it became a state.

This

was known to the Congress.
I think that what you are suggesting is an important
policy consideration, were we determining what is the appropri­
ate legislative policy.

But I do not think it is of any

assistance in the construction of the statute as wo find it
now.
QUESTION:

You agreed with Mr. Justice Stevens that

the statute could not be read literally out to the very length

34
and breadth of its literal language, that no — repeat, no
injunction shall ever ba issued by a state court against a
national banking association, didn't you?
MR. KANADAY:

1 don't recall unqualifiedly going

along with that.
QUESTION:

Well, what is your position?

What is

your — your answer to my bulldozer example was that you really
did not have to express an opinion on it, wasn’t it?
/.uU KANADhYs

That is correct.

We can always conjure

up a parade of horribles that carry the case beyond ~~
QUESTION:

What distinction would you draw in order

that my bulldozer example could be governed by an — you could
g«- en injunction in that case and you can't get one in this?
.•LUs.o iw.isjr-j.Djc .a »

iue

uri»txiiCuion that I would draw

would be limited to the facts of this case.

I am not prepared

to tell this Court wnat would or would not happen in the bull­
dozer case because we do not have a bulldozer case.,
I am prepared to say that there is a basis for a
logical distinction where the bank is acting pursuant to a
private contract which defines events of default and conse­
quences of those events of default as opposed to when the bank
acts unilaterally on its own notion.
QUESTION:

I don't suppose you would say an injunc­

tion was barred if the 'bank was engaged in some activities
unrelated to its banking business.

35
For example, if they started to drill
for oil on the land, do you think a court of equity might
allow an injunction then if you could show all th® usual
requirements?
MR* KANADAY;

It may well be that when a national

banking association has acted beyond its powers, it is not
entitled as in those activities to the protection of the
National Banking Act.

In the present situation, it is the

most usual type of national banking power that it is exer­
cising and that is to realize upon collateral.
QUESTION:■

Mr. Kanaday, what happens if, as a matter

of fact, the bank violated the contract and the mortgagor did
not?

What remedy would the mortgagor have under the laws of

Tennessee?
MR* &ANADAX u

Ye.ilt- Mrs. Pigg and I seem to have a

difference of opinion as to wrecker or not the sale could ba
nullified and set aside.

She says that under Tennessee law,

this could net happen if it carae into the hands of a bona fide
purchaser,
As 1 understand the law in the State of Tennessee,
there is no notion of the good faith purchaser for value in
real property.

The transfer really takes no better title than

the transferor conveys and so I think that it could be set
aside as a matter of conveyancing law.
In addition# the bank acts at its extreme peril

36
because there could be a remedy of damages which, albeit, leaves
. ome room for dissatisfaction, but it is a conventional remedy
for wrongful taking,

Mr. K&naday ; 1' want to b© sure of one

I take it your posture hare is that you are' relying

the strict language of the statute?
MR. KANADAY:
QUESTION:

Yesr sir, I am.

And I also take it that, in effect, you

have conceded that there might well be a legislative policy
that would apply whore the bank is there cm the one hand and
in a situation of this kind it might be a vary different
legislative policy.
MR. KANADAY:

If I made a concession that there is

38
a different legislative policy implemented in the antiinjunction proviso depending on whether the bank is a debtor
or a creditor, it was an inadvertent admission.
I think that the policy that is expressed in this
act is a concern incident to the federal regulations of na­
tional banks for the liquidity of the banks for the ability to
immediately realize on important, types of assets that are
within the banks ' control.

That asset .nay be a bank account,

as it was in Mixter.
The asset may be — or the property right which is
important to the solvency and the continuing management of the
bank may re its collateral, backing up a loan.

I think it is

the same policy that underlies it . statute, whether the bank
is a debtor or a creditor.
QUESTIONj

Then I run right

smack into Mr. Justice.

Rahnqulst'a inquiry about his bulldozer case.

You can say the

same thing about that.
MR. KANADAYs

Well, I don't know whether that is an

appropriate exercise of the banking powers to do that type of
an act, and I admit that that is a real egregious, horrible
thing that has been applied.

We can be equally disheartened

about the widow whose life's savings is in her home and she
only owes $1,000 and the bank wrongfully forecloses.

Wo can

postulate horribles but 1 don't think that we are dealing with
anything here but a foreclosure on a $700,000 commercial office

QUESTION?

don't they, if the are going to get their money back,
>2R. KMJADAY:
QUESTION:

We hope so*

Mr. Kanaday, am I correct, though, that

your argument based on the history of the statute, that this
is in the nature of a condition on the consent to be sued in
state courts would apply equally to the tort case of the bulldo*ori
MR, KANADAY:

Justice Stevens, I must admit that

because I view the anti-injunction proviso as a limitation on
the congressional grant of jurisdiction to state courts, that
you have got me into that corner and if X am going to be faith­
ful to that position, I suppose, viewed as a jurisdictional
limitation that it might well do that.

Yes, sir.

The factors that wa have haard !>.&;« tioned today,
adequacy of other remedies, legal fees, effects on home loans,
the possibility of error in bank judgment, these are all im­
portant considerations.

These are the types of things that

Congress, in its wisdom, should balance in its mind and. in its
will in formulating the extant to which it will consent for the
