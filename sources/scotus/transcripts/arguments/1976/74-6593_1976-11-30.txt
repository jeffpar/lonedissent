MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Livingston# you may proceed whenever you're
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES II. LIVINGSTON, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIVINGSTONs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is on certiorari from the affirmance of
felie death sentence of Daniel Wilbur Gardner.

Petitioner was

convicted of first-degree murder in Florida of his wife
following a hard day and night of drinking and arguments
about the location of their children.
As to sentence, it. was conducted pursuant to Florida’s
bifurcated sentencing procedure.

The State introduced into

evidence two photographs of the victim and waived argument,
The petitioner testified in his own behalf, his counsel made
argument# the jury returning a sentencing verdict, of life,
which# in Florida, is an advisory verdict.
The trial judge then ordered and considered a pre­
sentence investigation, disclosing portions of that presentence
investigation to both the State and to petitioner’s counsel.
He rejected the jury’s sentencing verdict of life, and
sentenced petitioner to death, on the basis in his fact-finding

4
that the aggravated circumstance , the nature of the crime being
especially heinous, atrocious and cruel»
The State Supreme Court affirmed per curiam. Two of
fch® seven Justices of that Court entered dissent saying that
it was fundamental error for the trial judge to have considered'
fend failed to disclose portions of the presentence investiga­
tion.
QUESTION: What was the basis of the trial judge’s
determination?

Was it not the natura of the crime, which ~

MR. LIVINGSTOM:
QUESTION:

One problem with —

Where would the district judge find out

the facts, become fully aware of the facts that would motivate
his decision there?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Your Honor, that's really the

crucial problem with the case, that the petitioner is not in
any position to know, really.
QUESTION: Well, where do you normally find out what
are the facts of a case?

In the courtroom, do you not?

MR. LIVINGSTON: Well, as to the facts in the —
as to the facts of the incident, as opposed to the individual­
ised considerations of the defendant, it would be from the
trial.

He sat there just as well as the jury did, obviously.
What we do not know is what sort of force the

information contained in the confidential portion of the presentence investigation had in his determination of -the

5

sentence.

What sort of force —
QUESTION:

And you have no idea what was not dis­

closed?
MR3 LIVINGSTON:

Your Honor, the State has recently,

about three weeks ago, as an appendix to its brief, reproduced
what purports to be a facsimile of the confidential portion
of the presentence investigation, which is something that we
have, not seen until now. No one has seen until now.
t
not admit its authenticity»
QUESTION:

We do

Mr. Livingston, I wonder if you would

lift that microphone up a little bit, or — it*s hard for me
to hear you over here.

Thank you,

MR, LIVINGSTONS Thank you, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Where do you say that is, in the —?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

It’s Appendix "A" to tha appellee’s

brief, Mr. Justice Brennan.
And this is after this Court granted certiorari.
QUESTION: Well, are you going to address any of this
as information that you might have contested had you had it
at the time of the sentencing?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes, sir.

With your permission,

I will go into that right now.
First, we claim this case can’t be decided on the
basis of that, anyway, because it’s not in the record.
never been authenticated.

It’s

We don’t admit its authenticity.

6

Secondly, that introducing it at this lata date*
almost three years after the time it was used? flouts the
procedural regularity required under the capital sentencing
procedures? post-Furman

and post-July 2? 1376„

Third? there’s no fair or proper way that petitioner
either now? or particularly at the time of the sentencing?
when it was not disclosed? can deal with this.

That the

reasons we say mandate disclosure of information used and
considered by the
QUESTION:

trial judge —
My question was? though? are there

contents — is there content here? had you had it at the —
been given to you at the time of the sentencing? —
MR. LIVINGSTON %
QUESTION:

Yes? sir? there are —

that you might have introduced

evidence to contest? that's my question*
MR. LIVINGSTON;
QUESTION;

Yes? sir.

I see.

Are you going to tell us what

that is?
MR. LIVINGSTON;
QUESTION;

Yes? sir.

Fine.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Obviously? Mr. Justice Brennan? this

is done arguendo? because we’re not assuming that it is
properly before the Court; we’re not admitting it.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. LIVINGSTON; But there are at least three factors

7
that are significant: here, and a fourth larger area.
One, in the information that was disclosed to
petitioner and his counsel, there is information he had had
a series of assault charges, all of which were dismissed, or
t

nol pressed? there was a statement from police
had a long line of charges involving his wives»

officers he

disclosed.
We get into the confidential portion.

For the first

time, the probation officer does something that the police,
the prosecutors, and no jury has ever done.
petitioner.

He convicts

He says ''Petitioner has beaten his wife X times".

That is not established in the view of the petitioner.

We

think it would be significant in the trial judge's mind.
Secondly , he ends up with a not© —
QUESTION:

You've lost me there.

MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You're addressing your comment to the

presentence report, are you?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, would the officer making that pre~
sentence report not be familiar with the evidence in the case?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Well, Your Honor, it would not be
the evidence in the case so much as background of -the individual.
And -—

QUESTION;

But you're addressing yourself to his

8

lack of

capacity to make some of these observations. But,

by tiiis time, the case has been tried and the jury has
returned its verdict- and it5s public knowledge as to what
went on.
MR. LIVINGSTON:

I’m sorry, Mr» Chief Justice, if

I led you astray, but w@:re not contesting ‘the actual
incident for which petitioner was. convicted, but rather the
probation officer was referring to other incidents, going
back to 1960 or something.? which we do not admit occurred.
And it has never been tested in any sort of adversarial
process.
These were all the charges -that were denied —
dismissed or nol pressed.
QUESTION:
page 57.

Well now, for example, I’m looking at

I’d like to get clear what you’re suggesting to us.
Here there is a reference to an incident involving

a first wife at Ft. Myers.

Was there any evidence /.hat the

trial for this offense, involving an incident at Ft. Myers,
involving the first wife?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir.

QUESTION: And what you’re saying here is that her®
at length this confidential report discusses an incident at
Ft. Myers and winds up that

broke into th© trailer,

noticed a colored man sitting in the front parlor with no
clothes on and his wife in the back room with a white man

9
apparently fighting or arguing.

He stated that he took out

his knife and told the colored man to gat out of there,” and
so forth .
Now, that's an incident at Ft. Myers.

Had you had

this information, would you have offered anything to contra­
dict what is stated there?
MR. LIVINGSTON;
trial.

I didn't represent petitioner at

I think he was entitled to be

to have that

disclosed, to him.
QUESTION:

I'm speaking of th® sentencing hearing.

MR. LIVINGSTONt

Pardon?

QUESTIONS At tha sentencing hearing, if you •—
MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTIONt

Well, at the sentencing hearing --

— had had this at that time, would there

have been an effort to refute this by other evidence?
MR. LIVINGSTONs

I ‘think he was entitled to notice

that this was something that was going to go before the judge,
and then have, with the consultation of his counsel, make that
decision.
We*re really referring, in particularity, not so ranch
to the Ft. Myers incident, but to the statement on page 61,
in th® same Appendix.
QUESTION:

What is that?

MR. LIVINGSTON: And that would be the end of the first
paragraph.

!5It should be noted that the subject in toes©

10

charges has had at least three times when he has beat on his
wi fe«M
And that is the first time that this comes up in any
way, other than these arrests, which were all tossed out.
QUESTION?

Now, this is on the victim, the wife, —*

MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Correct, that is the victim.

— but not the first wife.

MR. LIVINGSTON: Correct, that's the second wife.
QUESTION:

And, in other words, that he had a record

of at least three times beating on this same woman for whose
killing he was convicted, is that right?
MR» LIVINGSTON:

Yes, sir, but this never arose before.

This is the first time we have seen this in a confidential
portion of the PSI.
QUESTION:

And that was not in evidence at the trial?

MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir»

Nor before the jury that was determining

sentencing?
MR» LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Of course, that was

if it had been in

evidence, it would hardly have been helpful to your client.
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir, it would not.

If I had represented petitioner at ferial, in front
of the jury, we would certainly try to exclude that evidence,
and be sadly remiss if you did not.

11
QUESTION: But would that have been admissible under
the new Florida capital punishment law at 'the sentencing
proceedings before the jury? after the conviction?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

I believe it would have been

admissible under the Florida Statute 921.141.

I can31, at

this moment? pull out of my head tee exact aggravating
circumstance it would fit under.

But I think you would have

a difficult time keeping it out.
QUESTIONi
QUESTION:

Yes.
But to get it in? would the State have

had to introduce witnesses at the sentencing proceeding?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

The Florida Statute does provide

that th© State can use hearsay testimony in tee sentencing
proceeding.
QUESTION:
this report?

No? my question is? could they have used

Would teat be enough? or would tear© have to be

some testimony about it?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Well? what they would have» had to
#

have done is precisely what was not dona her®? Mr. Justice
Brennan.

Even if they had used this —
QUESTION:

Well? thatrs what I’m trying to get at.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes? sir.

QUESTION: What would they have had to do?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Okay.

If they had used this

information? or attempted to use it? regardless of the form?

12
whether it was police reports# hearsay# police officers#
whatever# -QUESTION:

Yes„

MR. LIVINGSTON:

— they would have then put

petitioner on notice what they were trying to do# they would
have given him the opportunity# ex necessity# to correct it#
explain it# rebut it if necessary.
Instead of# you know# being a shot from the dark#
something that only fch© judge saw.
QUESTION: Do you suggest that these is anything in
this report,which was not disclosed at the time of the
sentencing hearing# which would have tended to ©xculpata and
to persuade someone that the death sentence should not be
imposed?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Well# Your Honor# I think# if I may
torn that just a little bit, and that goes to what appears to
be the State’s position, that it’s all harmless error, anyway,
regardless; and I don't think that we can point so much ~
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't b@ harmless if there

was exculpatory evidence her®, which you may have exploited.
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir, but I think what we are

forced into doing, by the posture of the case, is to
speculate what was going on in the trial judge’s mind.
Our position is that you're entitled to have fch®
information, entitled to make your case before he makes up his

13

mind.
But? directly to your point? I think it would be
pertinent as to how he might have discounted mitigating evidence*
The jury had everything the judge had? except these two PS1
reports*
QUESTION?

It’s your view that there is no way of

determining what the judge had in his mind? -MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes? sir.

~~ when he imposed the death sentence?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

I think that w@ are forced to

speculate? and that takes it out of the harmless error rule
under Chapman.
But if I may return to what I was saying? that the
jury? after all? voted for life. They had everything that —
QUESTION;

Well? if the jury had voted for death?

without having any of this? and then the trial judge did what
he did? without disclosing this? would you be here?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes? sir.

I don’t think the case

would be as strong? however. I think the principle would
still pertain? but I think the strength of the case would not
be as strong.
QUESTION:

Well then? putting that the other way?

I gather you think it's significant the jury voted only for
life? and it's the judge who voted for death after having seen
this and not disclosing it.

14
MR« LIVINGSTON:

Yes- sir.

I think it's significant,

but not controlling,,
QUESTION;

I shouldn't say "voted”, he imposed the

death sentence*
MR. LIVINGSTON;
QUESTION;

He rejected the jury®s —

At what point in the Florida courts did

you raise this point?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, it was

first raised before -the State Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

On your appeal from what,the District

Court of Appeals?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

No, sir.

In capital cases in

Florida,- the appeal is taken directly under th© Florida
Constitution from the ferial court or the circuit court and
then t!i© State Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

So you mad® it in your opening brief in

the Supreme Court of Florida?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

It was mentioned, but not with the

exactness it should have been; it was mentioned again in th®
reply brief»

It was mentioned in oral argument* The two

dissenting Justices both picked up on it*
QUESTION;

But th© per curism opinion of the Supreme

Court of Florid® doesn't even deal with it.
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Mr* Justice Rehnquist, -th© per

curiam opinion in the State of Florida does not deal with any

15
issue advanced by appellant in that court.

It states the

jurisdiction, it states what the indictment says, it repeats
the fact-finding of the judge, and says S3affinti©d” in —*
QUESTION: But itss your contention, at any rat®,
that you adequately raised it in the Supreme Court of Florida,
so that under Florida procedure they would have to considar
it?

Do they have to consider something that you didnlt raise

before the trial court?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, their

practice is, in capital cases, to consider errors, even, if not
contemporaneously objected to at the trial leve10

Florida

Rules, Appellata Rules 6.16 and 3»7 both permit them to
recognise plain error; 6.16 goes further and says in capital
cases -they are under a duty to review the record,
QUESTION:

So that any error that you adequately

raise in your brief, they must considar under Florida
practice?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yas, sir.
?
And we*d say that, as T-appointed, certainly they
are not raised with the precision on® would like, in retro­
spect, it's certainly raised better than the issue was in
Boykin.
QUESTION:

Whan did you first know that fch® court

had relied on this?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Your Honor, the court's statement

IS
at tins© of sentencing was;

551 have furnished to counsel" —

or "Has counsel for the State received — and counsel for the
defense

received the portions of the PSX

report to which

they are entitled?"
Sounding like the decision is already made as to
what he was going to give them.

The prosecutor said, "The

State has, Your Honor"? defense counsel said, "The defense
has, Your Honor,"
So, presumably, they could figure out from that, if
they were only receiving a portion of it, that there was a
portion that wasn't being given to them.
QUESTION: Wien did you know — when did you first
know -that there was some «—
MR, LIVINGSTON: We did not know for sure — excuse
me, we still do not know for sure, Mr, Justice White, if there
is in fact a written confidential portion of presentenc©
inves tigation.
QUESTION:

Well, how did you know — you*re claiming

that he did rely on something, though?
MR. LIVINGSTON: We are claiming that he stated in his
findings of fact he considered it.
QUESTION: But did. you have any opportunity after -that;
to present your questions to the trial court, or was the only
plac© you could take your point to the Supreme Court?
MR. LIVINGSTON; The State Supreme Court.

17
QUESTION:

You couldn't have made a motion to a new

trial?
MR0 LIVINGSTON;
have.

Your Honor, defense counsel could

It. was not done»
If I may ~~
QUESTION;

Well, suppose you prevail, what happens

with this case?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Well, if w© prevail, it seems to

vs that at least three possible things could happen on remand.
One would be simply to send it back to the State Supreme
Court and say "consider it now51.
QUESTION;

For resentencing?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes, sir.

But, to me, that would

be inadequate because the State Supreme Court, like this
Court, has no way of certifying — authenticating that it is
in fact what the judge used and considered.
Secondly, the State Supreme Court would not have the
benefit of petitioner’s trial counsel’s reaction to this
information? his attempt to rebut it or explain it or argue
it, or what, whatever.
The second alternative would b© to send it to the
•«

trial court, simply some sort of pro forma admission of the
record,of the matter into the record, and then to re~institute
his sentence, resubmiko

That would fo@ inadequate simply

because it would b® pro forma, and it would take —

18

QUESTION:

Do you say reinstitute or redetermine?

MR, LIVINGSTON: To reinsfcitufce,
A thirdg
QUESTION: Well, you’re assuming his conclusion in
advance, when you say reins titrate the sentence.

If it's

remanded, so that it ultimately reaches the sentencing judge,
with

directions to open up the record, and hear any arguments

you have, are you assuming in advance that he will impose the
same sentence?
MR, LIVINGSTON:

Your Honor, I hesitate to do so,

and I know this Court hesitates to do so, but I think, given
the gravity of the decision, he has already made, it is beyond
any human being to say, "Oops, I made a mistake in sentencing
someone to death, let me try to do it again,”
And that's why I think -the third alternative, the
third choice on remand is the proper choice. And that would
be to remand the case for a new sentencing proceeding, d©
novo.

Obviously this doesn’t touch the conviction at all.
QUESTION:

A new sentencing

just the sentencing

procedure before the sentencing jury?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Correct, Your Honor, and then -QUESTION:

In which this total information would go

to that jury, would it?
MR, LIVINGSTON:
consider it, yes, sir.

If the judge intends to use and

19
QUESTION:

But you don’t claim there is any defect

of the sentencing proceeding before the jury, do you?
MR» LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir»

Then why should it be in the sentencing

proceeding?
MR, LIVINGSTON:

Because we -think that —

QUESTION: The only thing --MR. LIVINGSTON:

— the Florida procedure seems to

be something of a hybrid»

Host States either have the judge

firmly determine the capital sentence or the jury firmly
determines it.

In Florida they have the advisory sentence of

the jury is important, it is supposed to have an effect upon
the j udge.
Now, if we were on remand, if the State were willing
to stipulate that the jury would again recommend life, I
think that would be a decision to bs made at that point by
petitioner and his counsel at that point.
QUESTION:

Let me —' do you agree that the least

you can get out of this is life?
MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Well, why —

MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

In the case in its present, posture.

— why do you want to upset the life

verdict that the jury gave you?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Why do you want to upset that?

I don’t.

20
QUESTION; Well, what's the purpose of giving it to
the jury, so they can give death?
MRo LIVINGSTON:

Well, no, sir, I think on remand

the proper solution would he

to have another judge, and have

him do what he would need to

do from the beginning*

Now, if it could be done fairly by studying 'the —
QUESTION:

But you take the position -that the

jury was okay, because the jury didn't have this information.
The trouble carae when the judge

looked at this without letting

you look at it, so it 3hould go back to the judge, and

not

the jury,
MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I see the —

I thought that's what you were saying

when you started out, but now you've changed.
MR, LIVINGSTON:

I think my difficulty is that on

remand, we would submit, petitioner submits, that the proper
solution would be to give it to a different judge and he
would have to have the benefit of that information.

Now,

perhaps it could be done by stipulation, by a case stated —
QUESTION:

lies this Court ever, in a State

proceeding, said that a case would have to go back for re­
trial or resentencing before a different judge?

I realize

that on occasion Courts of Appeals in the federal system have
said that, in the case of a district judge? but has a federal
court ever said that in the case of where we1 re reviewing a

21
State proceeding?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Not to ray knowledge, ?lr. Justice
Rehnquisfc, yet we would point out this is a capital case, ifc*s
under the

post-Funftan, post-Woodson, post-Proffitt procedures

where —
QUESTION:

So what?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Well, because this point is an

extremely significant decision, it's to be made with the utmost
regard for procedural regularity.
If I may return to on® tiling you raised, Mr. Chief
Justice, and that is, you asked, “How do you think this might
have been used by the trial judge?"
And that would be that we know the jury recommended
life.

The most likely mitigating factor in the jury’s mind

was the drinking, the children, the marital setting of the
situation.

What we don't know —
QUESTION:

The matters disclosed by this report?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir, but what we are getting

to is that what *— how this report night have actually used
✓

them, and again we’re forced to speculation.
QUESTION; Could you not have demonstrated to the
sentencing jury all the information which is in this report?
That is, about his lifelong drinking habit, his tendency to
violence.
MR. LIVINGSTON: Well, the problem with the drinking

22
gad the violence is that these things can cut both ways.
Something that the trial counsel should be aware of at the
time, so that he can
QUESTION:

Well, it cuts not both ways if you want

to go back to that sentencing jury? it cuts only one way.
The best you can get out of them is reaffirmation of the life
sentence, life recommendation, and if they have all this
information before them, they might impose the death sentence,
might they not?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Well, Your Honor, -QUESTION:

It's a possibility.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

— when I was talking about the

use of the information in the confidential portion of the
PSI, I was attempting to address the issue of how the judge
might have used it, sine© we1re forced into speculating.
And it seems that the use of it and the danger in it is that
they say, "Well, he has beaten his wife? he had a worse
military record than, you know, was apparently disclosed."
He was characterised by the probation officer as "the usual
drinker and fighter", "assaultive nature", et cetera, ©t cetera.
Now, what -- how that might have been used by the
(

judge is to knock out what the trial jury apparently found to
be mitigating circumstances.
QUESTION:
procedure works.

Let tm understand how this Florida

After the verdict of guilt, then the jury is

23
assembled again for a sentencing proceeding; is that right?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Correct.

QUESTION: And that!3 an adversary hearing, of course,
isn’t it?
MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Now, then, after --- then the jury goes

out and it returns its re commendation.
MR. LIVINGSTON:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And then what's the proceeding before the

judge after the jury’s recommendation of life?
MR. LIVINGSTON: All right.

In tills case, what

occurred, Mr. Justice Brennan, is the jury returned its verdict
on January 10, I believe, he at that time ordered the
presentence investigation; this was turned ihi to him on
January 28; he sentenced the petitioner on January 30th.
QUESTION:

Was there any hearing of any kind before —

MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir.

He carae in, stated, "I

have furnished this to counsel, the portion to which they are
entitled.

Does the States have anything to say?"

55Does the defendant have anything to say?”

"No, sir.6’

Defense counsel at

that point pointed out that — the jury advisory verdict and
begged for mercy.

He had already made his determination

before he asked them to say anything,
QUESTION: Well, suppose when he asked counsel, "Do
you have anything to.say", counsel said, "Well, what you have

24
given us, we’d like to offer some evidence, opposed to as much
as you've given us”? would he have done that?
MR, LIVINGSTON:

Well. I think we:re being forced

to speculate, and the difficulty really, Mr, Justice Brennan,
is that he was not given
QUESTION:

No, but does the Florida procedure call

for that before the judge actually imposes sentence, an
opportunity for the defense to meet anything that is turned
over after the jury’s recommendation for sentence?
MR, LIVINGSTON:

The Florida procedure allows

locution immediately prior to the imposition of sentence,
QUESTION:

No, but how about ~~

MR, LIVINGSTON:

There is no clear step in the

statute that says there will be a separate opportunity for
argument at -the time of sentencing,
QUESTION:

So there’s no — at least -there's no

adversary hearing before the judge mandated by the Florida
statute?
The Florida statute does not require or even give an
adversary hearing before the judge»
MR, LIVINGSTON: Subject to the return of 'the jury’s
advisory verdict, correct, sir,
QUESTION: So that in so far as the judge’s function
is concerned, it’s just

it’s like in the more traditional

States where a judge does the sentencing?

25

Except that he does have a jury recommendation.

He does have a jury re commendation *

in a line of cases decided subsequent to the sentencing —
QUESTION;

And he has a record* he has a written

record,
MR0 LIVINGSTON;

A written record* and a line of

cases decided by the State Supreme Court subsequent to the
petitioner’s case* they have imposed an extremely heavy
importance to a jury advisory verdict for life,
QUESTION; Well* that’s the point* isn’t it? In the
?
case of Tetter v. State * that the — at least the opinion of
three members of the Court relied on in upholding this
procedure in Proffitt v„ Florida* that opinion relied upon the
Florida decision of Tetter v. State* which said that in order
to sustain a sentence of death following a jury recommendation
of life* the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be
so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person
could differ* unquote — and I'm quoting the opinion of the
Supreme Court of Florida,

And it was upon that proposition*

among others* that three members of the Court here relied in
upholding the Florida* and also upon the related proposition
that this would all be reviewed by the Supreme Court of
Florida,
And that there would be an opportunity for

to

-answer on the defendant’s part and argue to the sentencing

26

authority the affect of those facts.

And that, was entirely

denied here, wasn’t it?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Yes, sir, it was.

I think it should

be pointed out that —
QUESTION:

Did the Suprema Court of Florida have

the confidential •*— even the Supreme Court of Florida have
the confidential part of this presentence investigation?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, sir, the —

QUESTION: The dissenting opinion suggests that it
didn’ t.
MR, LIVINGSTON;
QUESTION:

It did not.

How could it possibly review the

sentence, then?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Correct»

And as to Tetter and

Halowe11, and some of the other cases to which you’re referring
and to which you all referred — you'and —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

•— the judgment of the Court,

Mr. Justices Stewart, Stevens and Powell, Tetter was after this
case.

And, just as a simple statistical matter, there are

now 77 people on Death Row in Florida? 27 of them had jury
verdicts recommending life, which were overridden? and the vast
disproportionate number of those were early capital cases
in Florida.
QUESTION: Wasn’t it implicit in the Florida law that

27
-- three of us, at least, thought that we were understood in
upholding it ~~ that all of this would he open and above
board, both in fee trial court and fee appellate court?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes, sir, I think feat that is

covered in the opinion announcing judgment of the Court?
in Proffitt, I think it is also — can be inferred from fee
decision in Woodson.
QUESTION:

Yet when you came to the point that the

jury had returned this recommendation and you ware before the
judge for fee final stage, was there any evidence tendered
on behalf of the sentenced, convicted man, or proffered in any
way to enlarge the showing to the judge as to why he should
accept the jury’s recommendation?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

Further­

more , —
QUESTION: Wasn’t that the occasion for it?
MRo LIVINGSTON:

If petitioner and his counsel had

known what was in fee confidential portion of the PSX, it
very well might have been.

But in fee'^disclosed portion of

the PS I, they could easily have concluded there was nothing
worth rebutting, that they could have relied on fee jury
verdict, they could have relied upon what had gone before.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Livingston, a little while ago,

when you said that the jury must have found some mitigating ,
circumstances, can you enlighten me as to what those possibly

28

were?
MR* LIVINGSTON2

Yes, sir*

They were .instructed

pursuant to Florida Statute 921*41 to 'the mitigating circum­
stances provided by that statute, which are that the defendant
acted under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, or, two, -~
QUESTION s

Under extreme what?

MR. LIVINGSTONs

Mental or ©motional disturbance?

or that his capacity to recognize criminality, and conform
his conduct to it- was substantially impaired.

Both ~~

QUESTION; Did you argue this to the jury?
MR. LIVINGSTON;
based on the drinking.

I believe it was argued in effect,
I was not trial counsel, but the

drinking, the petitioner-saying, "I was not in my right mind'5,
and so forth? which, presumably, together with -the distress
about the location of the children, presumably is what the
jury hung their hat on in the advisory verdict.
QUESTION: And those arguments, of course, were
available to the court?
MR. LIVINGSTONs
QUESTION;

/
Certainly.

Mr. Livingston, before you conclude, I

would like you. to complete your answer to a question that was
asked very early in the argument.
You were asked to identify the portions of the
confidential presenfcenca report which were adverse to your
client and which included matter not in the record before the

29

jury»

You did identify, on page 61, the reference to actual

beatings as opposed to arrests.
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Is there anything else?

Yes, sir.

There is also a claim

that petitioner spent time in the brig when he was in the
military, which is not in the disclosed portion.
QUESTION;

And what was that again, counsel?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

There is also a claim in the

confidential portion that h@ spent time in the brig while in
the Air Force, and yet that is not in the disclosed portion
of the presentence investigation.

There is a series of

characterisations about "he has an assaultive nature”, Hhe’s
the usual drinker and fighter”, et cetera, et cetera.
QUESTION:

There, is also that he assaulted his

first wife two more times, in 1970 and ’72, on page 58.
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Yes, sir, although I think that

perhaps that was included in the conclusions back on page 61.
But there is a series of things —
QUESTION;

/

Well, wouldn/t you like to know

whether those were additional or not?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Yes, sir.

Not only would I like to

know, I think petitioner has a sound constitutional right
under both the due process and Sixth Amendment provisions of
the Federal Constitution to know; he did not know, his counsel
did not know, and the sentencing is defective for that reason.
If I ma^ reserve

30

QUESTION:

And you want to know that in order to

persuade the judge that it isn’t true*

That would be one

approach, would it not?
MR» LIVINGSTON: That would be one approach, Mr»
Chief Justice, or to fashion an argument, as in Herring v. New
York, you needed
QUESTION:

Or to say that it is true and that this

shows this is a lifelong pattern of conduct which is, in your
view, a reason why the death sentence should not be.

I

suppose you could play that either way»
MR» LIVINGSTON:

Correct, Mr» Chief Justice, and

we claim that we need to know before the decision is mads.
It doesn’t do us any good at this point»
QUESTION:

Well, then, at most, your remedy would

be a remand to the district judge to do what you now say he
should have done at the time, or his —your client’s then
counsel should have done, had he known these things, and go
through the process again»

Is that right?

MR. LIVINGSTON: We think fell© constitutional under­
pinning of our argument would require it to at least go back
to the point of the jury's verdict and then forward — the
jury's sentencing verdict, even though I misspoke myself
somewhat earlier.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Allbritton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALLACE 3. ALLBRITTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it

pleas© the Court:
By preface to my remarks , I’d like to advise the
Court -that I have somewhat of a speech impediment, so if any
time I mumble or the Court does not understand any remark I
have mad©, pleas© let m© know and I will attempt to repeat it.
If the Court please, in Woodson v. North Carolina,
tills Court struck down a State law, and on© of the grounds it
gave was because this law failed to provide for the
particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the
character and record of the defendant convicted under it*
The Court went on to remark, and I quote very
briefly: Justice requires consideration of the character and
propensities of the offender, unquote.
And then the Court remarked, and I quote again very
briefly, that this is a constitutionally indispensable part
of the process of inflicting -the penalty of death.
Now then, today, this Court has been asked for
recede from Woodson, from that constitutional principle, by
emasculating a provision specifically tailored to furnish a
trial judge with the kind of information that this Court said
was constitutionally required before the imposition of the

32
de a til penalty»
I'd lik© to digress a moment about as to how this
case got hers.

It lias been urged that counsel didn't, have

the confidential part of -the PSI report; that the Supreme
Court, of Florida didn't have it.
I'll fee11 you why they didn't have it. is because
trial counsel in the ferial court didn't ask for it.

Ther©

were two motions for new ferial filed in the trial court.
In none of those is any mention mad© -chafe the trial judge
erred in refusing to disclose the confidential part of the
PSI.

Because* you see* if it had been* then* under the

Florida rule* the PSI could have been mad© part of the record
on appeal and it would have been before the Supreme Court
of our State.
And they could have reviewed it.

But this was not

don®* not done.
QUESTION;

Mr. Allbritton* isn’t it correct that as

a matter of Florida law only a portion of the presentence
report is disclcsable?

Or do I misunderstand?

MR. ALLBRITTON;

You misunderstand.

I’m not -The rule

provides that a trial judge may disclose all of it* --QUESTION:

I s©e.

MR. ALLBRITTON:

~ if he so deems fit.

And it

also provides that when the. presentence report becomes an
issue* that it can be included and it can be reviewed by an

33
appellate court. But this was not done, and that’s why the
Supreme Court didn't have it before it*
QUESTION:

Now, doesn't the Florida practice

require the Supreme Court to search the record for all possible
material error?
HR. ALLBRITTON: They searched everything they had
down there,
QUESTION: And is the procedure they followed in this
case consistent with their later description of the procedure
in the Tetter case?
MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION;

Yes , sir.

I think so.

Can it be consistent if they did not

look at the same material that the trial judge relied on,
on their own initiative?

How can it be —

MR. ALLBRITTON:
was net made mi issue.

I think it can look, because it

There was no mention

QUESTION: But I thought you just said that they have
a duty* independently, to investigate every potential issue
that’s material.

I ‘thought you said that was tee practice

in tee Supreme Court.
MR. ALLBRITTON: They do, in the -QUESTION:

Then why is the absence of a request of

any materiality at. all here?
MR. ALLBRITTON;

Well, it is, because they just

didn’t have it in front of them, Justice. They can’t review

34
what’s not in th© record on appeal»
QUESTION: But if they knew, as they did, that the
trial judge relied on something not before them, didn’t the
Tetter opinion indicate that they would have independently
made an effort to find out what was the basis for his decision
of death rather than, life?
MRo ALLSRITTON:
QUESTION:

No, I 'think that -~

Isn’t that what Tetter, in substance, says?

MR* ALLBRITTON:

Yes, it is, but I think it’s

argumentative to say that they knew what the trial judge
QUESTION:

had.

Well, if they read the dissenting

opinion, they knew the trial judge relied on something that
they did not. have before them.
MR, ALLBRITTON: And that was the first time it was
brought up,
QUESTION: But does that matter under Tetter?
MR* ALLBRITTON:

No, sir, I don’t believe it doss.

However, at no time, even until this present time,
has counsel, any counsel, made any demand whatsoever for a
copy of the confidential portion of the PSI,

So I took the

liberty of attaching it as the Appendix to my brief, so that
•this Court can read it*
Counsel says he doesn’t believe 'that’s authentic.
Wellf if he doesn’t, I have an authenticated copy her®, and if
he wants to read that, he can.

35

QUESTION: Well,, why shouldn’t the Supreme Court of
Florida look at it?
MR, ALLBRITTON:

They can, Justice, if it’s mad® a

part of the-, record on appeal; they can*
QUESTION: Well, you. wouldn't

you don't suggest

that the point wasn't made in the Florida Supreme Court, that
the trial judge had relied on material that had not been
disclosed; and it was clear that the appellant -there was
urging that that was error, constitutional error?
ME., ALLBRITTON;

Mo, I deny that emphatically0

It was not raised in tha Supreme Court of Florida.
QUESTION:

You say it was not raised, it. was not

raised by the parties but it was raised by the dissenting
Justices, was it not?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

It was commented on by Justice

Ervin in his dissenting opinion, -QUESTION:

Well, is this wroncf — I’m reading from

page 26 of the petitioner’s brief, it says "his Assignment of
Error Ho. 13 contended that 1 the court erred in considering
the presentence investigation of defendant’, and" — in Ho. 12
*Error Ho. 12 contended that 'the trial court erred in render­
ing its findings of fact in support of the death penalty be­
cause the court considered factors not based upon the record
of th@ -trial and. sentencing proceedings".
MR. ALLBRITTON: That, Your Honor, has to do not with

36

the failure of the trial judge to disclose the confidential
aspect of the PS I. he’s arguing there that the trial judge
erred in reviewing the PSI at all.

That’s what he is arguing.

That is a general assignment, and it does not deal with the
precise issue that is now before this Court.
QUESTIONS Well, his brief goes on and gets much
more detailed about it.
*

MR. ALLBRXTTON:

Yes, I know it does. And in the

brief that he filed in the Supreme Court of Florida he
mentions it, but not in the context -that it was error for the
trial judge not to disclose it, and particularly so when it
had not been requested by the defense counsel.
QUESTION:

It must have been error if — how did

the dissenting judges find out about it?
MR. ALLBRITTQN:
QUESTION:

Beg pardon, sir?

How did the dissenting justices find

out that this was a point in the css©?

Somebody must have

told them.
MR. ALLBRITTQN; Because it was mentioned in the
brief of appellant filed in the Florida Supreme Court.

But,

again, not in the context that the trial judge erred in failing
to disclose or refusing to disclose the confidential aspect
of the PS1.
QUESTION: Well, I know, Mr, Allbritton, but doesn’t
this get us back to my brother Stevens’ question to you?

At

37

least,- in. light of Tetter, was not the mention sufficient to
trigger a discussion and consideration and decision based on
it by the majority view of the Supreme Court?
MR. ALLBRITTON;

I believe, sir, that all they can

review is what’s before them.
QUESTION: Well, I'm asking you, in light of what
Tatter held, —
MR, ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION;

Yes- sir.

— as the responsibility of the Supreme

Court under the new Florida Statute.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

That*s a hard on® to answer,

because it’s hard to say that they have a duty to go into
matter that is not before them, that no point has been raised
as to this at all.
QUESTION:

No, but the point was raised- wasn’t

raised sufficiently at least.
MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I deny that.

The dissenting justices certainly

thought it was.
MR. ALLBRITTON;

The dissenting — he pointed it

out, but even he did not say that it was ©rror, because the
trial judge failed or refused to disclose the confidential
aspect of it.

He just mentioned it, as part of his dissenting

©pinion.
QUESTION: Well, is it not possible that since this

38
is an evolving area of the law, both

at the level of -this

Court and in the States, by virtue of these recent holdings r
that fee;

Tetter opinion decided aft®»* the Court passed on

this ease, the Florida Court, indicates soiu© enlarging of their
view of fee matter of what they should consider?
MR. ALLBRXTTOH;
well be,

That could well be.

That could

I can’t argue with that —.
QUESTION;

But if the case were to go back, in

vour view should it go bade -to the Supreme Court — and
I emphasize fee 5?ifR

should it go back to the Supreme Court

of Florida for their reconsideration, talcing into account the
material now in the .record, or do you think it should go back
to the sentencing judge?
HR, ALLBRITTON: Well, if feat terrible event occurs,
then I think it should go back to fee Supreme Court of
Florida wife directions to review the confidential portion of
fee PSI in order to determine whether or not there was matters
and things in there feat should have been disclosed to the
defendant and his attorney, so that the same could be
rebutted.
And whether or not the trial judge abused his
discretionary power in failing to disclose it in the absence
of a request so to do.
QUESTIONS Well, this Court upheld the Florida
Statute on the representations of Florida, -through its Attorney

39

General# and through its Supreme Court# and through its
Legislature# that this would be an open and above-board
proceeding; and now we get to this case and there wasn't one*

It could hardly have been clearer,- when he said* "We have no

to
MR- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
QUESTION;

No - you have —

A lot, of tins.

MR- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; ~~ lots of time yet.
At least in relation to your thirty minutes.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

All right, sir.

I think th© gravamen of petitioner’s complaint is
with the discretionary power feat is given to State court
trial judges to withhold certain parts of the presentence
report here.
Well now, if h©!s arguing about this, to me he’s
arguing against the entire criminal .process, because I
frankly tell this Court I know of no way in which the exercise
of a reasoned judgment can be cut out of the criminal
process.

It’s in it from beginning to the end.
And in considering th© responsibility of a trial

judge, that is a heavy on®.
on that.

I think all of us will agree

And practicularly is this tru© 3/n a capital case.

So then, in the exercise of this awesome responsibility, I
say to this Court that trial judges need help. They need all
th© help they can get.

And that is the purpose of the pre-

sen tan ce report, is to give trial judges the kind of help
that this Court said in Woods on was constitutionally required.
That is, bo learn about 'the character and the propensities
of the defendant.

42

QUESTION;

Can you think of any reason,, counsel, why,

if a motion had been made before the sentencing judge on
behalf of the defendant to produce the entire presentence
report, that

it should not have bean made available to him?

MR. ALLBRITTON:

Absolutely not.

There8s not a

thing in there that, in my opinion, would keep the trial
judge from disclosing the entire PSI.
QUESTION;

Nothing»

Is there anything in the record to

indicate why he did not do that on his own motion?
MR» ALLBRITTON:

I don't know why he didn't do ito

Absolut©ly not»
But going to that, too, the trial judge didn't say
that he relied on the confidential part of the PSI, that there
were things in there that inflamed him and therefore, conse­
quently, he imposed the death penalty»
That is just wrong, that's all.
QUESTION: Did the trial judge —
MR. ALLBRITTON;

He ddia*t do it.

QUESTION; Did the trial judge indicate publicly
that he had relied on the presentence investigation at all?
MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION;

Yes, he did; the whole thing.

He did?

MR. ALLBRITTON: And the major part of it defense
counsel had.
ha had those.

The things that could have been controverted,
It was only things that you need the protection

43
of confidentiality to help a judge
QUESTION:

General Allbritton, how about the state­

ment that the subject had spent time in the brig in the
military?

Now. that's not in the public portion of the PSIf

and how did he know that the judge had that before him?
It's a quote of what the defendant is alleged to have
said to the probation officer, whoever made the investigation.
MRo ALLBRITTON: Well, if he said it to the probation
officer, it must be accurate, then»
QUESTION:

But how do we know he said it?

He didn't

have a chance to say., "That's what I said" or "That's
different"«

I mean there’s nothing in the public part that

put him or his lawyer on notice that -the judge was told he
had bean — he had said that»
MR» ALLBRITTON:

No, sir»

There are things in the

confidential part that are not in the public part? that’s true.
But I say to you there isn’t anything in there that required
the trial judge to disclose it to him at all» There isn't

/
anything in there that it's inflammatory, that it would
prejudice the trial judge,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Allbritton, do

you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALLACE Ea ALLBRITTON, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ~ Resumed
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
15 d like to restate the fact that under both the
State rule and the federal rule, it is discretionary on the
part of the trial judge as to whether or not he will disclose
the confidential aspect of the presentence report.
Now then, the question would corae up: What would
be the harm in mandatory disclosure of this confidential part
of the PSI?

What harm would it do?

I say much in every way.
most,

Because, first and fore­

it would dry up the sources of information which

comprises — from which -the confidential part of the PSI is
mad© up. That report then would become nothing more than a
mere abstract of public records.

And then no longer would

the trial judga hav© the benefit of the kind of Information
that, this Court said was constitutionally required in order to
help him discharge his responsibility in the sentencing pro­
cedure.
QUESTION:

Where did this Court say that?

45

MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTIONS

Woodson v. North Carolina.

Did that involve a presentence investiga­

tion or discretion in the sentencing judge?
MR. ALLBRITTONs

It involved a statute; it involved

a statute.
QUESTION:

That involved a jury* didn’t it?

MR. ALLBRITTON:

It involved a statute* too* I know.

QUESTION: But didn't it involve sentencing by the
jury —
MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION:

And a jury* yes.

— and you don't give a confidential

presentence investigation to a jury.
MR. ALLSRITTON:
QUESTION;

That’s evidence in open court* isn’t it?

MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION:

No.

Yes, that’s true.

That was the system, statutory system at

issue in the Woodson case, wasn’t it?
MR. ALLBRITTON;

Well, whoever kind it was, still

the judge has to have it.
QUESTION: Well, but — excuse me.
QUESTION:

I suppose that’s what the Court said

through Mr. Justice Black in Williams v. New York.
MR. ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION:
v. New York.

Yes, it is, —

I thought you were quoting from Williams

46
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Yes, sir.

Let's think about this for a minute.

In securing

information upon which to prosecute a crime# a prosecuting
attorney relies on immunity in order- to get people to testify
in front of a grand jury»

Thus, immunity is a tool that h®

„

uses to get the information that he needs

just so# than# I

say that confidentiality is the tool that the judge can use in
i

getting the needed information to insure that a just punish­
ment is meted out to a wrongdoer.
But even then# in the exercise of the discretion# if
the trial judge feels that the confidential aspect of the PSI
is of such gravity# he can# in the exercise of his discretion#
disclose it to the defense attorney, so that he may rebut it
if he can.
But petitioner here says "not so". When a trial
judge exercise his discretion against disclosure# it is
contended before this Court that this#ipso facto# constitutes

h

a denial of due process.
/

It seems to ru® that the premises that must undergird
such an argument as that is that trial judges are simply
incapable of separating the wheat from the chaff when reading
the PSI# and thus# whenever the discretion is exercised againsi
disclosure# automatically this results in a due process — a
denial of due process.
Now# I deny this.

I can't subscribe to that.

I do

47
not impute that degree of unfairness or lack of impartiality
or lack of humanity to the trial judges.
Now# getting to Williams v. New York# Mr, Justice
Black said it better than. I can# when writing for a. majority
of this Court# and he said

I quote his words --

"The due process clause should not be treated as a
device for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in
the mold of trial procedure."

Unquote,

But now it may be you’re saying# ’’Well# look# this in
a capital case? we throw all that aside in a capital case,”
Well, this Court rejected that argument in Williams v. New York,
And again# very briefly# I’d like to read# and I quote# "It
is urged, however, that we should draw» a constitutional
distinction as to the procedure for obtaining information
where the death sentence is imposed.
contention”# the words of this Court.

We cannot accept the
And on down# I quote

again# "We cannot say that the du© process clause renders a
sentence void merely because out-of-court information" —
/

excuse me — "void merely because a judge gets additional outof-court information to assist him in the exercise of this
awesome power of imposing the death penalty — or sentence"#
unquote.
QUESTION:

Is it not; correct that in the Williams case#

the out-of-court information which the judge received was
disclosed to the defendant and his counsel in open court?

MR a ALLIS RITTOM;

No, sir, I don’t agree with that*

QUESTION: The only issue in that case, as I read it,
was 'the question, of confrontation of the out-of-court sources
of evidence*

MR * ALLB RlTTONj We11, Justice Stevens, I didn’t
read it the same way you did, then, because the way I read the
case, it was not disclosed to the defendant or his attorney,
and they claimed before this Court that that constituted a
denial of due process*

And this Court said, absolutely not*

And I say that the decision of this Court in Woodson
is an implicit reaf fixmance of the principle of Williams v,
New York.
I agree with -this Court when it said in Proffitt,
and I quote again very shortly, "It

is no longer true that

there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases
in which tha death penalty is imposed from the many cases
where it is not."
Nov?, the simple truth is, if truth can ever be
simple, that the presentence report is one of the key instru­
ments used in providing such a meaningful basis that this
1

Court referred to in Proffitt*
I cannot subscribe that in each and every instance,
no matter what 'the case, 'when a trial judge exercises his
discretion not to disclose the confidential: aspects of the
PSI, that this, ipso facto, constitutes a denial of due

49
process*

This Court repudiated that in Williams, and the only

way I know of -to get around it is for the Court to recede
from tiiat.
QUESTION:

Well? suppose the trial judge, in

arriving at his sentence, looked at a presentence report and
then said in his findings, ”1 find the follov?ing aggravating
circumstance, mid proceeds to find an aggravating circuras tenets
and then says, !ibased upon 'the presentence report®8?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Well, in the case that we5re

thinking about now, the judge read all of the presentence
report, and his findings —
QUESTION:

H® reads the presentemce report, he

does not reveal anything in the presentence report, but he
finds an. aggravating circumstance based upon what he read in
the presentence report.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

I beg your pardon, sir, I think

that was based on what he heard at the sentencing phase of
the trial.
QUESTION:
suppos®

I know, but let's suppose a case, let’s

I said to suppose a case.
MR. ALLBRITTON: Well, if we're going to suppose that,,

then, trial counsel, if he knows his way in and out the court,
is going to request that the confidential part be disclosed
and if he refuses to do that, ha can have it put in 'trie
transcript in the record on appeal, and it can be reviewed.

50
QUESTION: But isn* t your — isn't perhaps your
strongest point here that the judge* guided by the statute*
found an aggravating circumstance based upon the evidence
before the jury* namely * that the crime was especially heinous*
and found that there were no mitigating circumstances.
That's all he found* isn't it?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

That's right.

That's exactly -~

and he found that from the things that were produced at trial
and at the sentencing phase.

He did not say that he relied

on the PSI at all.
As I read his findings of fact»

And I think my

strongest point her® is that ever since the beginning of the
PSI* trial judges all over the country and this Court have
found it very proper to withhold the disclosure of sometimes
all and at least part of the confidential aspects of the PSI.
QUESTION:

That's not uniform* there ar© some that

do not follow that rule.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Well* there are some people* yes*

six".
QUESTION:

There are some federal courts where the

presentence report is filed in the Clerk's office.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

That’s true.

But I think I speak for the majority* that they
regard the decision to disclose or not as discretionary with
the trial judge* and when he doesn’t disclose it* it does not

51

constitute a denial of due process.
Let in© sum up by saying —~
QUESTION:

Mrc Allbritton. before you do* one of

the reasons for nondisclosure is to protect informants from
possible retaliation by the defendant, things of that nature.
Does that reason, or does any reason apply when the defendant
is to be killed?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Oh* yes, when h© is to be executed

by judicial due process, sir.
I think it does
QUESTION:

But how can he retaliate after -this all

takes place?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

0hf yes*

Yes.

Yes.

If someone

wanted to kill me, I have a 20-year-old son at home that would
be pretty angry about that, particularly if he found out that
someone put out a bad word on me.

Oh, yes.

The fear of

retaliation is there* The fear of the stigma in the community
of being a stool-pigeon.

Of course it's there.

People will talk when they know that what -they say
is going to be held in confidentiality.
it.

That’s the reason fc?r

But people are not going to talk to a probation officer

when they know that, they are liable to have to corae into
court and repeat it, and whet they say than will become public»
Now, that’s common sense.
I think all of us will admit that — I hope —

52
QUESTION:

Did you indicate, earlier,- General

Allbrifcfcon* that you didn't understand -that the sentencing
judge relied on the presentence report?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Not expressly* no»

He relied on

that among other things* Justice Stewart»
QUESTION:

It seems to me vary express — I'm looking

at page 138 of the Appendix»

You're familiar with that* I

guess?
MR» ALLBRITTON:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.

In which he says two different times*

he says first of all that he has received a presentence
investigative report on said defendant by the

and receipt

by the State and defendant's attorney of a copy of that portion
thereof to which they are entitled? and then he says, "and
after carefully considering and weighing ».. and reviewing the
factual information contained in said presenhence investiga­
tion. the undersigned concludes and dstermines that aggravating
circumstances exist* to wits"

and then he itemizes them* and

then he sentences the defendant to death.
That's pretty clear that h© did rely on it* isn't
it?
MR. ALLBRITTON:
other things.

Not in toto* no* sir.

That* among

I can't say he relied on -the confidential

part of it* and it doesn't say so in what you just read.
QUESTION;

Nobody suggested that it was in to to* I

53
think, Mr. Allbritton? just whether or not he took it into
consideration in imposing the sentence.
MR. ALLBRITTON:
purpose of it, sir.
QUESTION:

Yes, he did take it? that's the

That's -the purpose of it.
And he made it very expressly clear that

he did so.
MR. ALLBRITTON:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is up, Mr.

Allbritton.
MR. ALLBRITTON;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Livingston?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

MRn CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have a minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES II. LIVINGSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Okay.

How many, sir?
One minute.

As to Williams,

Mr. Justice

Stevens is exactly correct. That was a confrontation case, it
was not a disclosure case.

337 U.S, 244 describes how that

information was disclosed in open court.
In addition, Williams was a pre-Furman case, also
decided, obviously, before the July 1976 capital cases.
As to the confidential problem, that can be controlled.

54

Federal Rule 32 controls*

We8 re not here claiming we have a

constitutional right to ba free from all out-of-court informa­
tion, but we are here saying that we’re entitled to know what
the judge is using, if there is a need to protect somebody, if
there is a need not to disclose, he can disclose that, and
say
QUESTION %

Could I ask you, how could the pre-

sentence report have influenced or affected the judge’s finding
that there was the aggravating circumstance of an especially
atrocious crime?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

It could have affected it by

knocking out the raitigatirg circumstances which tine jury —QUESTION:

No, I didn’t

I!m going to get to that.

How about the atrocious, the aggravating circumstance?
MR. LIVINGSTON; That circumstance was in open court,
before both the judge and jury.
QUESTION; So that you put, -that aside, but now —
but you think the presentence report might be relevant to
establishing a mitigating circumstance?
MR. LIVINGSTON;

Or to the disregarding of mitigating

circumstance, which necessarily must have been
QUESTION: Well, I know, but he found there were no
mitigating eireamstances,
MR. LIVINGSTON; Correct.

And he found it by reading

the same information differently than the jury did, about the

55

drinking and whatever# arid the only difference —
QUESTION5

I know# but suppose h@ had had no

presentence investigation at all# and he had just disagreed
with the jury# you wouldn’t have any complaint then?

You'd

have a complaint# but not this on®.
MR* LIVINGSTONs

Our complaint would not

be

founded upon a confidential report# the undisclosed# unjustified,
unexplained nondisclosure of the confidential portion? no, sir,
it would not be.
QUESTIONS Well, you think there might fa© something in
the presentence report that affected his judgment about there
being a mitigating circumstance present or not?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

Sir, I believe that we ar© being

pushed into speculating as fco what affected his decision-making
process at this crucial stage.

And by being forced to

speculate, it takes it out of harmless error rule in any
event.
But, yes, we are having to guess, and I think that's
th® most likely operation there, that it caused him to disre­
gard what the jury found to be mitigating.
QUESTIONS Are you familiar with the Florida Supreme
Court decisions in Songer v. State and Swann v. State?
MR. LIVINGSTONS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Both of which were cited and implicitly

approved in one of the opinions in Proffitt, and each of which

56

approved the use of a presentence investigation report by
the sentencing judge under the Florida system, didn't they?
MR, LIVINGSTONs That's correct, Mr, Justice Stewart,
neither of which addressed the confidential problem, however,
QUESTION s Was it clear in each of those cases that
there had been a disclosure -to the defendant or his counsel
of the contents of the presentence investigation?
MR, LIVINGSTONs

In Songer, I am certain there is a

disclosure of the nonconfidentisi portion, but not the
confidential portion.

In Swann, I don't have any present

recollection as to that point,
QUESTIONS Both of those decisions were implicitly
approved, weren't they, in a footnote, footnote No, 9?
In

oks

of the opinions in Proffitt.
MR. LIVINGSTON s
QUESTION;

Correct.

Well, Songsr expressly states that h®

received a copy of the PSI and it doesn't differentiate between
the nonconfidenfcial and the confidential part,
MR. LIVINGSTON;

x

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Then you were mistaken?

MR, LIVINGSTON;
QUESTION;

On what point, sir?

In saying that there was not e disclosure

of the confidential portion of it. in Spnger.
MR. LIVINGSTONs

No, sir# in Songer —- it's outside

57
tli@ record *— in Sanger there was a confidential portion and
there was a disclosed portion- The defendant did not get 'the
confidential portion. The' Florid© Supreme Court decision
addresses the area,

of the PSI in general, but does not

address itself to confidential versus disclosed.
QUESTION:

Of course, in Songer or Swann or on®

of the cases, at least, the Florida Suprema Court sat aside
the

death sentence.
MR. LIVINGSTON: That would be Swann.
QUESTION:

Swann.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Senger is still under sentence of

death.
QUESTION:

I think you said in your opening argument

that were this case back before the jury, you would object to
the submission of the present©nee report to the jury.

Did I

understand you correctly?
MR. LIVINGSTON: Well, my understanding at the time
of that point in the argument, Mr. Chief Justice, was that
the information as to the guilt deciding phase of the trial
as being collateral incidents relevant to the crime.

That's —

I'm saying if I were his trial counsel, I think an astute
trial counsel would object to this collateral information
coining on the guilty/not guilty phase of a bifurcated trial.
QUESTION: Well, at that point the guilt has been
determined by the jury, why would that be excludable?

58

MR, LIVINGSTON;

No - sir, what I was talking about

was if there was an effort to introduc® it at the guilt
determination, the first half of the trial *—
QUESTION;

No, no, we were talking, in your opening

argument, about the possibility of fch© case being before the
sentencing jury, after the determination of guilt.

I und©r~

stood you to say that if the case, by some chance, should get
into that posture by virtu® of any remand, that you would
object to the introduction of the report at that stag® in
fch© sentencing process,
MR, LIVINGSTON; Well, my answer may not have been
responsive.

My understanding at the time of making that

answer was that it related to fch© first half of the trial,
which isn’t involved her©,
QUESTION s

Oh,

MR, LIVINGSTON;

But as to fch© sentencing jury, our

position is that if the State is going to use it, if the judge
is going to use it, consider it, review it, that the defense
should at least be entitled to notice of the general nature
of it, so if they can’t — you know, they may not be able to
keep it out, but they can rebut it, clarify it, or explain it.
QUESTION;

Well, if it went to -fch© sentencing jury,
i

you surely would have a copy of it,
MRc LIVINGSTONS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It couldn’t go to the jury without going

59
through you, through counsel.
MR. LIVINGSTONs

Yes, 3ir.

Well, one would think

tha the due process clause and Sixth Amendment would keep it
from going to the judge without, going through us, either,
under the circumstances of this cas®.
Thank you very much.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:21 o’clock, p.m., the cas© in -the
abov@~antit.led matter was submitted.]
