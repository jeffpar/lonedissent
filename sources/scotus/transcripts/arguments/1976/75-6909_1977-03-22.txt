Mr. Brummer, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNETT H. BRUMMER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRUMMER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I would like to take this opportunity to introduce
Albert G. Caruana, Esq., co-counsel for petitioner and a member
of the bar of this Court.
We are before the Court this afternoon on certiorari
to review the first decision by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to interpret and apply this
Court’s decision in Chambers v. Mississippi.

We urge this

Court to reverse the court below.
In this case, the repeated application of Florida's
voucher rule devastated the petitioner’s ability to demonstrate
his innocence.

The voucher rule clearly serves no legitimate

state interest, thus the voucher rule’s impact on the
petitioner's rights to a fair trial, confrontation and compul­
sory process deprived the petitioner of due process of law.
This case arose out of the death of the petitioner's
daughter as a result of the battered child syndrome.
issue W3.S who was responsible.

The

The state charged the petitiones’.

4
At. trial, the defense attempted to prove, one, that
the petitioner was innocent? and, two, that the petitioner's
wife, Linda, was probably responsible for the child's death.
Linda had been, the only other suspect.
The defense —
QUESTION:

At ’trial, did you ever really take the

position that the mother was guilty of the battery?

That is

one of the arguments of your opponent, and I didn't find you
really squarely raised that in the trial.
MR. BRUMMER:

Your Honor, we ware not counsel for

the petitioner at the trial, but I think that it was clear on
the record of this case that Linda was adverse to this peti­
tioner at -the time she was called to the stand by the defense,
if that is the direction of Your Honor's question.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the question is did the

defendant or his counsel ever specifically advise the trial
judge that it was his theory that the wife was guilty of killing
the child?
/

MR. BRUMMER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I believe the

record is very clear in this regard, and there are a number of
places in the record where, this is so.

First of all, it is

clear on the record that Linda had been the only other suspect,
she had given a statement to the police which tend el to incrim­
inate the petitioner.

She was listed as a state's witness on

the state's witness list.

She had been subpoenaed to the trial

5
by the state and brought to the trial by the state from Texas.
In his motion to suppress, the petitioner saicl that
he had confessed in order to protect his wife.

In opening

statement, the defense said it would show who probably killed
the child and it was not the petitioner and -that Linda Maness
would be tha defense's chief witness.
Of course, after Linda took the stand and she testi­
fied consistently with tha state's theory of the case, any
question as to her adversity clearly was cleared up.
an immediate denial by Linda that she was guilty.

There is

In that

there are only two suspects hare, if she is not guilty, the
petitioner is:.

She.

QUESTION:

You would expect her to say, yes, she. was

guilty?
MR. BRUMMER:

We did not expect her to say that she

was guilty but we felt that w© were entitled to a fair oppor­
tunity to present cur defease for consideration of tha jury.
The testimony that she came out with, that she had bean out of
the house at the time that the baby was injured, and the baby
had been alone with the petitioner at that time, was refuted by
hex letters, by her statements to various witnesses who war®
present to testify.

We wanted from her own mouth to explain

before the jury how she made these statements, so the jury
could weigh her credibility when she testified that she was
not guilty.

We also sought --

QUESTION:

Did you. make an effort in side bar confer­

ence or whatever Florida procedure provides in a case like
that to show that, regardless of the general rule, the trial
judge in this case, after what you had shown, should make an
exception to the voucher rule?
MR. BRUMMER:

Your Honor, the voucher rule was applied

to keep out numerous items of evidence.

Each time the pe­

titioner vigorously attempted by every means at his disposal
to get the evidence admitted with regard to the letters in
particular, counsel said this is of utmost importance that we
get these letter’s into the record, if I don’t know how to do
it, please tell me.

The court would not tell him.

He then

asked for a recess so that h© could research the law in order
to find out how to get those letters in, but it was clear that
no matter how he turned around, the court had the answer and
the answer was the voucher rule.

That was the only answer that

the court had for the petitioner's attempt to present his side
of the story.
QUESTION:

There seams to be some suggestion that

perhaps seme of "the evidence that you wanted to introduce was
excludable on some other state ground?
MR. BRUMMER:

I believe, Your Honor, that the record

is imminently clear, the only objection made to this evidence
was i±te voucher rule.
QUESTION:

And the only ruling of the court, that there

7
ever was?
MR. BRUMMER:

Was on th@ voucher rule.

Additionally,

the Fifth Circuit found that the evidence was excluded by the
voucher rule.

This appears at the appendix, page 227.

QUESTION:

Were

those letters ever introduced on

federal habeas?
MR. BRUMMER:

The letters ware not, but the petition

reflected sworn avermence by the petitioner as to the contents
of those letters.
QUESTION:

Why weren't they, do you know?

MR. BRUMMER:

It seemed to me, ard I was counsel at

that time and co-counsel at that time, that it was more effec­
tive to characterize those letters than to introduce a number
of papers, and if respondent had any question he could deny or
he could file a motion to produce, if the court had a question
the court could have requested the filing of those letters, but
neither the respondent nor the court came forward with any
request for those letters.

As a matter of fact, the respondent

completely ignored those allegations,
QUESTION:

A while ago you were talking about a party

to an action who had soma standing for credibility, but on this
record how can you suggest that his characterization of those
letters would be better than the original documents?
MR. BRUMMER:
tion of those letters.

Your Honor, it was not his characteriza­
Those letters were in the possession of

8
counsel.

They ware characterized by trial counsel at the time

of the trial, they were in the possession of counsel at the
time that the petition for habeas corpus was filed, and we read
those letters and characterized them ourselves.

It was not the

petitioner’s characterization.
Additionally, there was no response from the respondent
questioning our characterization of those letters —
QUESTION:

Bod you enter an offer of proof of those

letters?
MR. BRUMMER:

There was never any request for an offer

of proof, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know, but most people will make an offer

of proof, just to protect their offer,

But the letters are not

in the record, that is my real question?
MR. BRUMMER:
QUESTIONS

No, they ar© not, Your Honor.

I find it hard to understand why counsel

had than in his possession and did not produce them and offer
them ©r at least, as Justice White suggested, make an offer of
proof as to what they contained.
MR. BRUMMER:

Your Honor, I would not say that we did

not make ar, offer of proof at any time.

We did not make an

offer of proof in the federal district court because the issue
was never raised.

The question of the availability of th©

letters never cam© to the for© until the Fifth Circuit mentioned
the unavailability of th© letters in its affirmance of the

9
lower court.

At that time we did file a motion to supplement

the record with the letters? that motion was denied.
QUESTION:

But it is your burden to convince the

court on a petition for federal habeas that some wrong has
baen done you, isn't it?

You can't turn around and say, well,

gee, if w© had only known we would have supplied the necessary
evidence.
MR. DRUMMERs

Your Honor, I submit that the federal

district court accepted our averments-

Our averments regarding

those letters are reflected in the federal district court's
order- of dismissal.

Secondarily, the letters were but one

part of the fabric of this cas® which is based on the inability
of the petitioner to cross-examine Linda Maness and introduce
various items of evidence, including
QUESTION:

Were they marked as exhibits?

MR. DRUMMERs

No, they ware not, Your Honor.

At the

time of the trial, the trial judge asked to view the letters.
The prosecutor protested, the letters are not marked into
evidence.

Th® trial judge responded "I know it,55 and she

proceeded in violation of normal procedure to review those
letters and rejected them on the basis of the voucher rule.
But th® letters are just one part of the evidence which was
excluded.
%

QUESTION:

Well, do you have a proceeding in Florida

whereby an item to be offered in evidence is first marked for

10
identification and then offered in evidence?
MR. DRUMMER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct» Your Honor.

And had these letters been marked for

identification but not admitted in evidence» or had they not
even been marked for identification?
MR. BRUMMER:

I believe the record reflects that

they ware not marked even for identification.
Th© federal district judge found that w© had in fact
exhausted our state remedies and denied th© petition on the
merits.

On appeal» the Fifth circuit mad© certain findings of

fact and conclusions of law which we believe to be erroneous.
The first, and foremost is that the petitioner's trial
did not violate the fundamental fairness standard discussed by
this Court in Chambers.

The court made some contradictory

findings and we believe that they shou3.d be the focus of this
Court's review of th® Firth Circuit's decision.
Th© Fir til Circuit said that th© voucher rule undcubtedly worked to the petitioner53 detriment» and that some evi­
dences which suggested his innocence held been excluded.

More­

over» the integrity of th© fact-finding process had been im­
paired due to the petitioner's inability to cross-examine Linda
Maness.
It should be pointed out that ha actually atfcemptsd
to have Linda Maaess admit that she knew that Gary Maness, th©
petitioner» did not do it.

Ea was interrupted in mid-question

11
by an objection based on th© vouchor rule which was sustained
by th© trial court.

We feel that the defendant had that right

and this was a crucial exercise of that right.
Regardless of th® record and regardless of its own
findings, the Fifth Circuit concluded that th© extent to which
th© voucher rule, interfered with the right to present a de­
fense was not sufficient to constitute a denial of fundamental
fairness.
We believe there ar© two bases on which this decision
is incorrect.

First, we believe that the record does reflect

a violation of the fundamental fairness guarantee.

Second, we

believe that, the record reflects a violation of the Sixth
Amendmant guarantees incorporated in the due process clause.
This lower threshold standard which, the Firth Circuit said did
not form a part of this Court's decision, in Chambers was com­
pletely ignored by the Firth Circuit otherwise in its disposi­
tion of this case.
We submit that the damage don® to th© petitioner's
case in this case was a greater deprivation than that reflected
in Chambers v. Mississippi.
More evidence favorable to the petitioner was excluded
in Maness than Chambers.

I». chambers, the third party's con­

fession was admitted into evidence and was before the jury for
the jury's consideration.

Chambers was restricted only in his

ability to cross-examine the third party confessor as to his

12
repudiation of that confession*
QUESTION:

Of course, her® you doa5t have a confes­

sion at all, do you?
MR. BRUMMER:

I submit. Your Honor, that we did cm

the circumstances where there are oaly two suspects and Linda
Mac,ess says that the petitioner did asst do it, I submit that
■this is as close to a direct, confession as you can get.

Hex

statements included references to the fact that not only that
the petitioner did not do it, bit that Linda was not at the
store at the time that she had testified.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

10:00 o’clock tomorrow morning.
MR. BRUMMER:

Thank you. Your Honor.

[Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock p.in., argument in the
abov@~entie.ld matter was adjourned, to reconvene on Wednesday,
March 23, 1977, at 10:00 o'clock a.m.]
