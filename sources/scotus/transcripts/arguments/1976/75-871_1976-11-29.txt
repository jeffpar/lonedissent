MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 871, Manson against Rrathwaite.
Mr. Gaffney, I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD D. GAFFNEY, ESO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. GAFFNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Bernard Gaffney, and I'm an assistant
in the office of the State's Attorney in Hartford, Connecticut.
And I might say that in addition to.representing the petitioner
in this appeal, I represented the State in the trial of the

case in

the

Superior Court in

Hartford, and I have also

represented the State in the various judicial proceedings
which have followed, in both the State and the Federal courts.
This case arose from an undercover narcotics
investigation in Hartford.

Factually, on the evening of

May 5, 1970, an undercover State police officer*, Jimmy
Glover, and an informant went to the third floor of an
apartment building on Westland Street in Hartford for the
express purpose of purchasing narcotics.
Now there's some question as to whether Glover and
the informant went to the specific apartment unit on the
third floor that they had intended to go to.

And there's

4
no question that when they got there, the transaction was
with some other person than had been intended.
However, there's no question that Officer Glover,
in exchange for $20, purchased two glassine envelopes
containing heroin.

And in court, Glover made a positive

identification of the respondent, Nowell Brafchwaite, as the
seller of the narcotics,
?4ow, if I might just go on, the sale took
at the doorway to the apartment.

place

And the testimony was that

the total transaction, that is, from its very start to its
conclusion, took somewhere between five and seven minutes.
And during this total period, the door to the apartment
remained open for a period of about three minutes.
seller was standing in the doorway.

And the

And Glover said that

during this three minute period, he stood within two feet
of his seller and was looking directly at his face.

And he

went on to say that he had absolutely no trouble in seeing
in the hallway,
QUESTION:

It was night time, though?

MR, GAFFNEY:

The transaction, your honor, took placs

at approximately or began at approximately 7:45 p.m.
QUESTION:

On what date?

MR, GAFFNEY:

May 5, 1970,

Now Judge Friendly, in his opinion, the Second
Circuit Court opinion, pointed out that sunset on that date

5
occurred at 7:53 p.m.
How outside the building at the conclusion of the
transaction, Glover gave a description of his seller to officer
Michael D’Onofrio of the Hartford Police Department.

D’Onofrio

was stationed outside the building as the covering officer.
How D’Onofrio knew Brathwaite by sight.

He'd seen

him on a number of occasions prior to the date of the sale ,
and he recognized the description which Glover gave as
applying to Brathwaite.
Now, that night or the following day D’Onofrio
obtained a photograph of Brathwaite from the files of the
Hartford Police Department, and he took thatphotoqraph over
to State Police Headquarters and he left it on Glover’s desk.
And I might point out parenthetically that the office of the
State Police Headquarters in Hartford and the City of Hartford
Police Headquarters are in two different buildincrs, geographically
separated from one another by some distance.
How, a day or two later, soecificallv, on pfav 7,
Glover returned to his office, and he found the photo which
D'Onofrio had left on his desk, and he positively identified
the person shown in the photocrraph as the same parson
from whom he had purchased the narcotics.
I think it’s worth mentioning that at the time he
did that, at the time Glover viewed the photo, D’Onofrio was
not present.

And as a matter of fact, there’s no evidence

o

that there was any contact between TVOnofrio and Glover between
the date of the sale and the date of the photographic viewing,
and no evidence whatsoever of any verbal influence cr
pressure brought hv D’Onofrio upon Glover to make an
identification —
OUT! ST ION:

Except the picture?

MR. GAFFNEY:

Yes, your honor, except the picture.

Now, after it was confirmed by analysis that the
substance sold was in fact herion, police arrested Brathwaite.
And it's of more than a little significance, I would submit,
that Brathwaite's arrest occurred at the very same apartment
from which the sale had taken place.
home.

That was not Brathwaite's

He lived on another address on Albany Avenue in

Hartford.

And the Westland Street address was occupied by

a Mrs. Ramsey.
"s

Now, Brathwaite said on cross-examination that he
had visited that apartment on Westland Street many times prior
to the date of the offense, and that Mrs. Ramsey, who occupied
that apartment, was a friend of the family.
Now, during the trial, through Officer Glover, the
State offered testimonial evidence of the photographic
identification and the photo itself, and officer Glover made
a positive in-court identification of Brathwaite.
Now the principal issue before this Court as I
understand it is whether the case of Stovall v. Ttenno, which

7
this Court decided in June of 1967, established a. strict
exclusionary rule such that the admission of evidence of a
pre-trial identification, an unnecessary and suggestive
pre-trial identification, renders a criminal accused
conviction in violation of due process standards,

mhat is

what the Federal Appeals Court said in reversing the decision
of the United States District Court, that Stovall did
establish such a rule and that the rule was violated by the
State.
How, the petitioner has conceded that the procedure
which the police used was suggestive, in that it did consist
of a one-photo showup.

And we 've also conceded that the

procedure used by the police was unnecessary, because there
really was no emergency that existed and no exigent
circumstances that would have prohibited the police from resorting
to some more reliable technique.
We dispute the fact, however, that the suggestivenessness was in any way pronounced or aggravated or even
remotely like that which existed in the Foster case, Foster
and California, which was decided after Stovall, I believe,
in 1969.
And I emphasize, in making that point, that Detective
D'Onofrio knew Brathwaite by sight; that he had seen him on
a number of prior occasions; and that he recognized the
description which Glover gave him.

8
And I also stress that D’Onofrio was not present,
when Glover made his identification from the photograph, and
exerted no influence, no verbal influence, upon him.
IThat we are saying is that although the photo,
the pre-trial photo identification proeedtire, was unnecessarily
suggestive, there was no grave likelihood of any misidentification under all of the facts.
Now, with respect to the issue before your Honors,
the existence or non-existence of a strict rule of exclusion
nowhere in the language of Hr. Justice hrennan's opinion in
the Stovall case, and Isrfi referring to Part IX of that
opinion, nowhere do the words, exclusionary rule or strict
exclusionary rule, appear.

of that opinion,

is that,

Hhat the Court said, on page 802

qiiofce,

a claimed violation of due

process of law of the conduct of a confrontation depends on
the totality of the circumstances which surround it.
And the same overriding principle was restated
about a year after Stoval in the Simmons case reported in
390 U.S., and in that case Hr. Justice Harlan said, we hold
that each case must be considered on its own facts.

And he

went on later in the opinion to say that convictions will be
set aside only if the procedure was so impermissibly suggestive
as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable
misidentification.
Now, in April of '69, the Foster case to which

0

I’ve alluded, Foster against California, adopted the same
language, deciding that identification procedures should
be judged, quote, in the totality of

the circumstances.

And your honors, I’m sure, will recall that in that case
there were repeated procedures used by the police which the
Court said violated due process, and that conviction I believe
was reversed.
\224

QUESTION:

What case was this?

MR. GAFFNEY:
OUESTI0N:
Is that the case?

Foster against California, your honor.

The opinion written by Justice Fortas?
Well, it doesn’t matter.

HR. GAFFNEY:

I didn’t think it was Justice Fortas.

I think Justice Fortas may have written the opinion in
Coleman against Alabama.
QUESTION:

No, Justice Brennan wrote that.

MR. GAFFNEY:
QUESTION:

Oh, all right.

Well, in any event, I can look it up.

I was just trying to recall the case •—
MR. GAFFNEY:

Coleman and Alabama., I know, was

decided after Foster in 1970.

And again, similar language,

totality of the surrounding cix'cumstances as being the key
to evaluating or assessing the prejudicial effect of a pre­
trial lineup in that case.
Now, more recently, of course, in the case of
Neil and Diggers, decided in December of 1972, this Court

in
said in rather specific language that it's the reliability
of the evidence, under all of the circumstances which is the
central question.

So that it's overall reliability which

is paramount, as 1 read the case, even though the identification
procedure may have been suggestive„
That is the position which the petitioner takes in

247

this appeal, that the admission of the showup without more,
in the language used, by Justice Powell, does not violate due
process, and that each case should be decided on its own facts.
flow, I submit to your honors that if the niggers
criteria, those enunciated by Mr,, Justice Powell in that
case, are applied to the instant case, that Glover's
identification is wholly reliable.
And the reasons for that contention I've tried to
put forth beginning on page 12 of the petitioner’s brief: the
opportunity to view the suspect.

Glover was at very close

quarters at the doorway to the apartment.
directly at his subject.

He was looking

And the door was opened during that

period for up to three minutes.

The degree of attention.

Here you have a trained police officer —
QUESTION:

Wag Glover a full time police officer?

MR. GAFFMEY:

Yes, he was, your honor, with the

State Police, acting at that time with an undercover narcotics
unit.
OUESTIOfI:

fir. Gaffney, is the testimony about what

11
was said during the confrontation consistent with it beina
two or three minutes in duration?

Wasn't if quite a brief

conversation?
HR. GAFFNEY:
brief.

The conversation, your honor, was

There’s no question about that.

The door opened.

It

was then, while the door was opened, that a conversation
occurred.

The door closed.
QUESTION:

But now you say there wouldn't have been

two or three minutes in that coversation, would there?
HR. GAFFNEY:

There would not have been two or

three minutes of conversation.

But the testimony as I read

it was that the door — and this would relate particularly
to the time after which it was first opened — that during
that period up to two to three minutes was consumed.
’i

Now, I assume that during that period Brathwaite
wanted to fce sure that he could deal \-7ith the parties that
were attempting to buy from him.
QUESTION:

I thought -- maybe my memory fails me —

I thought that the door was closed after the first conver­
sation.

Then after a few more minutes it opened again, and

there was another conversation.
HR. GAFFNEY:

Well, the conversation when the

door opened the second time was quite brief.

By that time

Brathwaite, the seller, had obtained the narcotics, and it
was more a matter of getting them into the hands of the

12
buyer —
QUESTION:
precisely.

Let me put my question a little more

The two or three minute observations is it

your view that the conversation took two or three minutes,
or that there was a very brief conversation and that they
stood for another two minutes looking at one another silently?
MR. GAFFNEY:
For the reason that I

Well, I think more like the latter.
:tried to indicate, that the seller

wanted to foe sure that he could deal with the parties in
front of him, that he wasn’t being set up.

And the

conversation would not necessarily have had any bearing on
that.

So I think that the two or three minutes took place

initially, and that the period of time after the door opened
a second time was much briefer.
Insofar as the degree of attention, as I've
indicated, Officer Glover was a trained officer, trained
\

police officer.

And of course he was on a potentially

dangerous assignment.

And 1 think you can feel sure, at

least. I felt sure, that he was careful in viewing his subject.
The accuracy of the description certainly as Brathwaifce
appeared in Court, he complied with the description given.
The level of certainty: OfficerGlover was unequivocal in
his identification in court.

And the length of time between

the crime, the date of the crime, and the confrontation, was
relatively brief, a day and a half, perhaps two days at the

13

very most.
QUESTION:

Well, why did he wait two days to pick

up this horrible criminal?
MR. GAFFNEY:
days to pick him up.

Well, it wasn't that he waited two
It was two days at most when Glover

got back to his office to find the ohotograph on his d esk.
OOESTIOIT:

Well, what was the delay?

MR. GAFFNEY:

Well, I don't know that, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that there was any delay.
QUESTION:

I think —

He went there for the purpose of finding

QUESTION:

I suppose this was not the only narcotics

case in Hartford in that period of time?
MR. GAFFNEY:

Oh, no, by no means, your honor,

by no means.
QUESTION:

What independent answer do you have to

my question without help?
MR. GAFFNEY:

Well, the delay insofar as the

confrontation occurred in Glover's not getting back to his
office until May 7, that is May 5 to May 7.

As far as the

arrest is concerned, that would not, under the procedures
used in Hartford, that would not have occurred until after
it v?as confirmed by analysis, toxicological analysis, that
the substance purchased was* in fact, narcotic.

Nov?, that

And I concede that that is a rather extended delay.
I can tell you

is that it relates to the

And all

backlog* the

15
worklog, of the state laboratory in Hartford.
After it was confirmed, if I recall it, Brathwaite8s
arrest took place not too long thereafter„
Now, the rationale, of course, of the reasoning for
fete strict exclusionary rule as Justice Powell wrote, is
to -deter the police from using a less reliable procedure when
a more reliable one would be available to the police„
Now, the Court said, that the rule would not be
premised on the assumption that the admission of the evidence
of such a confrontation offends due process.

Now, if that's

the case, it would seem to me in the first instance the
question is whether such a. strict rule is going to have any
deterrent effect on the police.
Now, Justice Blackmun discussed that issue in a
1367

recent case decided this past July, U.S. against Janis.
I think that was a Fourth Amendment case.
Court's discussion in the

Janis

But based on the

case it would seem that

there's more than a little doubt that in fact such a
rule, an exclusionary rule, has a deterrent effect.

At least

some doubt among the analysts or the statisticians or
those who have perhaps looked into it.
But assuming that it does, assuming that it will
have a deterrent effect, I suggest to your honors that what
is important is that there is no compelling need today for
such a strict rule.

How, my experience is limited, I concede, to
Connecticut, and more specifically, Hartford, and the .
areas that surround Hartford.

But I’ve been exposed over the

years to a great, great many cases, and I submit to your
honors that the abuses today are minimal, whether the police
are learning or what the reason is, I'm really not preapred
to say.
But I can say this: in my experience, photo showups
and highly suggestive procedures are the exception today and
not the rulet 3that in the great majority of cases where
photo showups, for example, are used, they are used by the
police because of circumstances which may be peculiar to the
case, or to confirm the identity of a person who is already
known,

MR. GAFFNEY:
QUESTION:

That certainly does help, your honor.

You don't want to lose that point?

MR. GAFFNEY:

Ho, X don’t.

That’s important.

If the basic purpose of a trial is the determination
of the truth, and Mr. Justice Stewart said that in the
Tehan v. Shott

case decided in 3B2 U.R. at 416, and X

to it.

If you accept that,

But I certainly subscribe
X submit that the prosecution

then should not be prohibited in all cases from introducing

17

this type of evidence, because the effect of the rule will
then be to been out what in nosh cases is real Tv relevant
evidence, and in nanv casos, certainly probative evidence
and perhaps valid evidence as well.
TTow, Justice--Mr. Justice Blackrmn said, iurists
and scholars uniformly have recognized. that the exclusionary
rule imposes a substantial cost on societal interest in law
enforcement by its proscription of what concededlv is
relevant evidence, that in the Janis case to which X iust
referred.

I guess that’s really the point I’m trvincr to make,

that something will be lost in nanv of the trials if such
a rule is adopted.
And as an aside, and as a practical matter from
one who is a prosecutor, in cases such as this ogp, where
you have one witness identification, Glover beino the sole
identifying witness, the evidence is going to cono into the
case anywav.

x'he defense in its cross-examination of the

State’s chief identifying witness, undoubtedly — in most
cases at least — is going to offer the evidence for the
purpose of undermining the chief identification witness
for the state.
'Tow, 7 submit that if that occurs, the Rtate 5n
many instances is going to be placed in a tad light.

Juries

simply are not going to understand that the state, because
of the inadmissibility of the evidence, "asn’t permitted to

offer it in the first instance, and having failed to present
it, I subiait again, the state just is not going to look good.
Juries want to hear all of the evidence.

experience that they don't like objection.
QUESTIONs

I'm not sure I understand the argument

you're now making, Mr. Gaffney, and I want to foe sure I do.
You say on cross-examination —
MR. GAFFNEY:

I don't know if it's a cogent

argument, your honor, for deciding whether there should be
a rule or not.

I offer it more from the practical sense,

But in a case such as this one, where you have a
one witness identification, and the State presents that witness
and ha makes an in court identification without any reference
to the pre-trial procedure, the defense, in the great majority
of cases, is going to cross-examine that witness and develop
that there was a pre-trial procedure, to point out how
defective it was, how suggestive it was.

So that the

evidence is in the case anyway, and the jury sitting and
hearing that case, hearing that evidence come in for the
first time —
QUESTIONs

They'll wonder why it wasn't put on

by the prosecution.
MR. GAFFNEY:

— wonder why

didn't the State •—

why are we hearing it now from the defendant?
QUESTION:

For the first time?

MR. GAFFNEY:

And I submit that that doesn’t make

the stats look very good.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. GAFFNEY:

I see your point.

Now, if there is no such rule,

then the evidence, at least in some cases, is offered by the
prosecution, I submit that certainly the trial judge, in an
appropriate instruction to advise the jury of the weaknesses
and the dangers and the deficiencies of such suggestive
pre-trial procedures by the police.
In summary, it’s the position of the petitioner
that Stovall and the cases that have been cited since Stovall
did not establish a strict exclusionary rule? that due
process standards do not require it? and that there’s no
compelling need for the adoption of such a rule today,
particularly if the objective is the deterrent effect on the
police? and that the key question is really one of reliability
reliability of the identification

evidence under all of the

circumstances? and whether notwithstanding some suggestive
pre-trial procedure, whether there’s really any great
substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification? in
short, that the cases should be decided on a case by case
basis.
Now, in what I have referred to in the petitioner’s
brief as a contingency opinion, Judge Friendly said that even
if there was no exclusionary rule, ex-en if he was wrong in

that conclusion, the respondent should he given a new trial
for other reasons.

And I can see that the Appeals Court had

a right to examine the record and interpret the legal signifi­
cance of all the facts in the context of due process.
But when the Court decided that Officer Glover
was not a reliable witness, not a credible witness who,
because he was a police officer, whose job it was to make
arrests, that an ordinary citizen or a bystander would be a
more credible witness, that Glover's positive in court
identification of Brafhwaite wasn't worthy of belief.because
Brathwaite was the only person sitting at the counsel table,
and that he must have made dozens of other arrests between
the time of theoffense and the time of the trial, I submit
that in that connection the Appeals Court was inject5.ng its
own viewpoint, its own personal conviction, and those were
peculiarly •— 1 would think within the province of thejury.
Justice Frankfurter, in the Fialinksi case, 324
U.S. at page 417, expressed it well, far better than I have,
when he said the judicial judgement in applying the chje process
clause must move within the limits of acdepted notions of
justice, and it is not to be based upon the idiosyncrasies
of merely personal judgement.

An important safeguard against

such merely individual judgement is an alert deference to the
judgement of the state court under review.
And if I may, your honor, l"d like to reserve

21
whatever time may he left to me for rebuttal argument.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. GOLUB, EBQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. GOLUB:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the

Court:
The paramount and undisputed issue, the fact in
this case, is that the identification testimony that served
as the sole basis for respondent Brathwaite’s conviction was
derived from what has been conceded by the Btate, and what
has been found by every court that has reviewed this case,
to he an impermissibly suggestive procedure that was totally
unnecessary under the facts of this case, under the circum­
stances.
QUESTION:

You're not suggesting that that alone

xtfould excliide an in court identification?
MR. GOLUB:

No, we’re not, your honor.

Me recognise

that there is an independent basis test that would still be
applicable to the in-court identification.
QUESTION!

You’re just saying that the testimony

about the out of court identification should have been
excluded simply because it was impermissibly suggestive?
MR. GOLUB:

Fell, we do say that.

identification is automatically excluded?

individual who was observing the seller without the benefit
of electric lights at the time of sunset.

Fe have an

We have an individual who was subiected to

a very suggestive photographic confrontation, but moreover
was subjected to the suggestiveness of his superior officer
saying, I know who it is.

I know it’s Rrathwaite.

And we

have an individual who, no matter how certain he may have
been, felt it necessary to look at fch e picture again before
the day of trial when he was to make an in court identification.

40
With respect to whether or not a strict rule of
exclusion is warranted in this case, we have argued in the
brief that there is a constitutional basis for the rule»
And X think- we5 re also aware that several members of this
Court have, indicated that there is some doubt in their
minds as to whether a constitutional basis, either in the
Fifth Amendment right to a fair -- the ricrht to a fair trial,
exists.
We feel — we don't retreat from the position we
took in the brief as to the fact that the identification
law cases, Gilbert and Stovall, indicate that there is a
right to a fair — that the right to a fair trial would anolv
in warrant of the term, exclusionary rule.
But we feel in addition that the recent decisions
of this Court dealing with the development of the standards
under which a deterrent rule is warranted — and I'm talking
about decisions such as Michigan v„ wucker,

Calandra, Brown

v. Illinois, and cases such as those, indicate that there are
certain guidelines that this Court feels are applicable when
creation of a deterrent rule is considere^.
And in Michigan v. Tucker the Court indicated that
even when there is no constitutional basis for the rule, a
deterrent rule can be warranted for prophylactic rules desiqned
to ensure constitutional rights.

Of course, in Michigan v.

Tucker, it was the Miranda rule that was — the fruits of the

41
Miranda rule that were at issue.
But the point in Michigan v. Tucker, and the point
in all these cases is, the Court has been formulating standards
by which

deterrent rule can be warranted.

And we feel

that under the standards announced in those cases, that the
strict rule of exclusion suggested and adopted by the
Second Circuit is fully mandated.
And I would like very quickly to go over some of
the principles that we feel some of these prior cases have
indicated.

There was a concern in the prior cases with

whether or not the conduct that is being deterred can in
fact be deterred.

One of the criticisms of the fourth

Amendment rule is that it applies to searches and seizures
which are made in good faith.
By contrast, in this particular instance, we3re
dealing with a rule that applies only to xmnecessarv photo­

MR. GOLUB:

Thank you.

Mr. Golub, you may

42

Mr. Chief Justice? and Members of the Court:
As I was saying before the lunch recess, I think
that if we look to the cases of this Court in recent terms
dealing with the development of exclusionary rules for
deterrent purposes? they provide guidelines which can be
applied to this case and which mandate creation of the rule
that the Second Circuit adopted.
As 1 mentioned before, this rule, the strict rule
of exclusion of unnecessarily suggestive identification
evidence, deals only with evidence that can and should be
deterred.

Because the procedure was unnecessary, it is

either willful or negligent.

It falls within the definitions

of all the-cases that deal with the development of these
rules, as conduct of which the officers have knowledge is
improper or are properly chargeable with knowledge.
Second of all, I think it’s clear that this is a
rule that will have impact.

It’s a rule that will aim

directly at the conduct of the officers.

They will under­

stand under what circumstances their conduct was permissible,
under what circumstances their conduct was not permissible.
It avoids the second step of the analysis, which gets into
the particular individual who made the identification, the
witness involved.

The officer may not often, under present

law, understand that it’s the witness' length of observation
or the witness' memory that makes an identification survive.

43
Under the strict rule of exclusion, impact on the
officers will be clear.

If they use a suggestive means, they’ll

understand that that means is whv the -— it's as a result of
/

that procedure that the evidence was excluded.
Thirdly, it’s also clear that there really is no
other remedy right now for the victim of this hind of
procedure.

If there is no constitutional basis for the

procedure, if there's no constitutional violation that occurs
when a photographic shovrap is employed, certainly there’s
no remedy under any kind of civil rights action or any kind
of tort theory.
This Court has held only recently that the prose­
cutors are immune from suit for something like this.

I

would think it would clearly fall under the recent decision.
QUESTION;

How would the prosecutors conceivably

have any responsibility for the identification process?

Or

do you mean that he might ba at fault for using — for
attempting to employ an identification?
?1R. GOLUB:

Well, I think very often — excuse me.

I think very often the prosecutor himself engages in an
identification procedure.

In this case, for example, on the

day of the trial, the prosecutor did show the photograph to
agent Glover again.

So a prosecutor may himself became involved

I imeant to answer

with respect to the totality test, your honor.

With rasper

to the totality test, Judge Friendly found that both the

giving rise to a misidentification.
Under the per se rule, there would still be a
finding possible on the in court identification.

not adopted for the out of court identification, but that
the totality was, a substantial likelihood of a misidentification.
MR. GOLUB;
OUESTIOW;

Yes, your honor,
And let’s assume that in a particular

case, applying that rule, it was found that the pre-trial
identification was so suggestive that it should not be
admissible because of the substantial likelihood of
misidentification.
Would that automatically preclude any in court
identification?
MR. GOLUB;

It would not automatically preclude it.

Practically speaking, however, since the tests are so similar,
it’s unlikely that -OUEGTIOU;

Well, I know, but there’s a — why

there was an independent basis for the identification?

MR. GOLUB:
QUESTION:

I certainly believe that there should be,
Well, if that is true — Judge Friendly

did not go through that routine.

TTe just found, in the

latter part of his opinion, that on the totality that if the
out of court identification was bad, the in court automatically
was, didn’t he?
MR. GOLUB:

X don’t think he’s clear in his opinion

as to why .'he ’ s suppressing the in court identification.
QUESTION:

Wall, at least he never inquired as to

whether there was any independent basis for the in court -—
MR. GOLUB:

We raised it in the court in our brief,

and he did not specifically articulate why he was suooressing
the in court.

As I read the opinion --

OUESTTON:

But in any event, you don’t — whatever

the rule that is adopted for the out of court identification,
you do not claim that that automatically

MR. GOLUB:

Oh, no.

WO do not claim that.

QUESTION:

Well, then, was your answer to Justice

Marshall correct or not?
MR. GOLUB:

Well, X think it’s correct on these

facts, your honor, because —
QUESTION:
MR. GOLUB;

Oh, on these facts?
On these facts only, it’s correct.

And

that’s all I meant to say, with

respect to these facts.

I’m reading this on page 27a:

Assuming,

which we do not believe, that Simmons states the appropriate
test for both of Glover’s identifications, we hold that both
were inadmissible.

End of quota.

MR. GOLUB:

I think that’s — and I think he's

Well, that is the bottom line.

QUESTION:

Well, you mean that on retrial there

would -- however, if there were an in court identification
by Glover, then the State would have to go forward also
and show there was an independent basis, not related to the
showup?
MR. GOLUB:

On a retrial, the State wqjild, yes.

OTJESTION:

But the State would have to show , in

addition to Glover’s in court identification, a basis for it.
That identification v?as rested upon a basis independent of
the showup, would it?
MR. GOLUB:

Yes, I believe that that would -—

It sounds to me like Judge Friendly on

Yes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD D. GAFFNEY, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. GAFFNEY:
may, with

Just very briefly, your honor, if I

respect to some of Mr. Golub’s comments.

I don’t

know whether he meant to imply, or actually said, that
Detective D'Onofrio was Glover’s
that is not accurate.

superior officer.

If so,

They work — and I thought I indicated

that in my opening argument

for entirely separate law

enforcement agencies.
And when Mr. Golub mentioned that D’Onofrio said
after Glover had given him the description, I know who it
is, it’s Brathwaite, perhaps .Mr. Golub meant to imply that
that’s what was going through D’Onofrio’s mind, and itmay
well have.

Rut he did not make any such statement to Glover.

In fact, he made no statement of any kind to Glover.
Mr. Justice Marshall asked about the use of a mug

shot, particularly one mug shot by the police.

And it is

true that this does occur particularly in narcotics cases
as your honors probably realise.

The undercover officers

actually go out into the drug culture, try to get to know
these people in

garb which is totally un-police-like, and

eventually, when they do recognise and get to know the
dealers, they are dealing with a parson who’s known to him,
to the buying officer.

So that when the mug shot is used,

thereafter, most frequently it5s used to simply confirm the
identity of a person that’s known to the officer that bought
the narcotics.

I think that’s a little bit of history.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't the admissibility of the out of

court identification be critical in a lot of cases?
MR. GAFFNEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would, your honor.

Yes.

In the sense that without the pre-trial

identification and without it’s being admissible, the officer
might have a real problem in identifying in court?
MR. GAFFNEY:

Nell, I suppose that would be true if

there was a lapse of time, particularly.
QUESTION:

Nell., and not only that, but havincf

dealt with — but having seen an awfial lot of people.
MR. GAFFNEY:

That’s right, that’s correct,

hecause

there are a great many persons that these undercover officers
deal with over a period of time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gaffney, if

we apply the totality

51
of circumstances test, am I correct in assuming that that
would mean both the in court and the out of court identifications
would always stand or fall together?
MR. GAFFNEY:

Well, no, I would think that if the

pre-trial procedure was found to be defective and yet there
could be an independent basis shown for the in court
identification apart from the pre-trial procedure thatthe
State could hopefully proceed on that basis.
QUESTION:
reliable or not?

But isn’t the inquiry as to whether it’s

And if it is reliable, well, you pass it

for the out of court as well as the in court»
MR. GAFFNEY:

Well, yes, I guess that’s so, your

Reliability is the key.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:12 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
