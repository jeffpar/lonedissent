MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1264, International Union against Robbins & Myars ,
and 1276, Guy against Robbins £ Myers.
Mr. Goldstein, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY L. GOLDSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER DORTIIA ALLEN GUY
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justic®, and

may it please the court:
I shall emphasise the important in reversing the
Sixth Circuit from the perspective of providing fairness to
the victims of employment discrimination and encouraging
effective implementation of the public policy of achieving
equal employment opportunity.
Mr. Newman will argue from the perspective of
encouraging voluntary compliance and incorporating equal
employment opportunity into the lav? of the shop.
This case arises from a straight-forward set of
undisputed facts.

Mrs. Guy, a black woman, was originally

hired by Robbins & Myers on November 1, I960.

From October

.19 through October 24, 1971, Mrs. Guy was absent due to
illness.

That illness was excused by the company.
On October 25, Mrs. Guy did not return to work. She
*

was immediately discharged.

Within two days, she caused a

review to be undertaken of her discharge by filing a grievance

4
pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement entered into
between the Union and the Company,
Within 22 days, cn November 18, 1971, the Personnel
Director, after reviewing the decision, denied her grievance.
Within 84 days of that decision, on February 10,
1972, Mrs, Guy filed a charge with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

That charge was filed 108 days after

the initial company decision to discharge Mrs. Guy.

Herein

lies 'the case.
The lower courts held -that the ninety-day limitations
period began to run from October 25, 1971, the date of the
initial company decision to discharge Mrs. Guy.

That 90-day

provision was amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act
of 1972 to 180 days.
The petitioners here raise three grounds why Mrs,
Guy’s charge should be treated as timely filed.
The first one is that the final occurrence of the
unlawful act did not occur until November 18, 1971, when the
Personnel Director of the Company last acted pursuant to the
collective bargaining agreement and the contractual relation­
ship between the company and Mrs. Guy.
Twc, the petitioners submit that the filing of a
crievrncs tolls the running of the period of limitations during
t.h© resort to the grievance procedure.
And lastly, the petitioners submit that the 180-day

period provided by the 1972 amendment applies to this case.
The first ground, that the practice had not occurred
until November 18, when the Personnel Director of the company
affirmed the initial decision to discharge Mrs* Guy, does not
involve any analysis of legislative history nor any review of
this Court’s seminal decisions in Johnson v. REA and Alexander
v. Gardner*■ Donver.

Rather, the issue is, as the Seventh

Circuit stated in f too re v. Sim.be am Corp., when was the last
occurrence of the unlawful act.
We submit that that occurrence was when the
Personnel Director last acted under the collective bargaining
relationship with Mrs. Guy„
On October 25, when the —- excuse me.
QUESTION:

Did the Personnel Director have to take

rr affirm; viva action at that time, or did he just sit?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Your Honor, the contract, as set out

I think, oh 37a and 38a of the Appendix, requires the
Personnel Director to make a decision within ten days of the
submission of the third-step grievance fee him.
When the company initially made its decision to
discharge Mrs. Guy, the situation was analogous to an
anticipatory contract breach.

The contract between Mrs. Guy

and the company was not thereby terminated. She had a right
to sc ak review of the decision to discharge her by filing a
grievance rnd proceeding to s. conference with her foreman,

5

general foreman, and the Personnel Director of the company,,
During these three steps of intra-company review,
the company had sole power to reverse its initial decision,
reinstate Mrs. Guy, and cure the breach of contract.
To treat the denial of her grievance by the company
as the final occurrence which triggers the running of the
limitation period within which the worker must file a charge
with EEOC accords with common sense.

When there is the

possibility —
QUESTION:

Hr. Goldstein, did sh® have a right of

further review within -the grievance machinery?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, she had

the right: to proceed to arbitration.
QUESTION:

Well, would it not be appropriate to

postpone the denial, the complete denial of her contractual
right to

- her termination contractual rights, until the

time in which she could obtain review expired?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes. Mr. Justice Stevens, it could

be that the period here would have been tolled until November
28th, since she had ten days to — or the union had ten days
to indicate whether they were going to take their option and
proceed to arbitration.
QUESTION:

So, is that your position, or is it

whenever they — I don' t see how to differentiate, in other
words. beirr \xi the denial after tha third stag©., and the

7
initial discharge.

Because, tinder your theory, neither of

those was the expiration of the contractual relationship»
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I think, Mr. Justice Stevens, it

would be more correct to say November 28th than November 18th,
when the union refused to — or the decision was made not to
proceed to arbitration.

But it was unnecessary to reach that

question here, since —
QUESTION:

It wouldn't affect your timing.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's correct.

When the agreement for which you bargained provides
protection against discrimination in employment, and also
provides an accessible means of redress, it is understandable
that a worker like Mrs. Guy, who was also a union steward,
would turn first to her collective bargaining agreement and
the support of her fellow workers before turning to the
government.
Accordingly, petitioner Guy's charge was timely
files, regardless of whether Congress intended that the limita­
tion period could be affected by equitable consideration such
as tolling.
However, an analysis of the legislative history of
congressional policies effectuated by Title VII, and this
Court's opinion in Menander _v._ Gardner-Denver Company, all
support tolling the limitations period during resort to the
grievance procedure.

8
The Sixth Circuit's and respondent’s reliance on
Johnson v. REA is misplaced»
In Johnson, this Court held that federal actions
undertaken pursuant to Section 1981 and Title V1X were
independent, separate, and distinct; and stated that the filing
of an EEOC charge does not necessarily toll the limitations
period for filing a 1981 action»
The Court, in comparing the remedies available under
19 81 and Title VII, examined each and said that each has its
advantages and each its disadvantages.
Here, however, there is no such parity of judicial
enforcible remedies.

The grievance procedure is conciliatory

and pragmatic, geared, as this Court has said, to the law of
the shop, not the law of -the land.
Second, i.i Johnson, the Court looked to the State
tolling law.

Here the only question is the application of the

federal limitations period.
This Court has repeatedly stated that the question of
whether a limitation period, a federal limitation period, is
tolled or not is not a semantic question, is not a determina­
tion of whether the period is procedural or substantive.
Rather, it is a question of examining what is the intent of
Congress.
Here Congress made it clear in several ways in the
legislative history of the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity

9

Act, that the limitations period in 706 and specifically
706(e) were to be interpreted so, quote* *as to give persons
the maximum benefit of the law5’ * unquote*
The Congress specifically approved this Court's
i

flexible interpretations of the limitations period for deferral
to State fair employment agencies in Love v. Pullman Company
and it specifically approved other equitable considerations*
such as the notion of continuing violations„
Lastly* the Court* in Johnson * stated that -the
adoption of the State tolling principles was not inconsistent
in that case with federal policies* since the Court pointed
out little was at stake.
Here -there is much at stake,. The accommodation with
the effective utilization of the system for industrial selfgovernment* to achieve equal employment'opportunity.

The

grievance machinery is not an alternative judicial remedy/
rather/ it is a basic component of industrial self-government
and a -prime mechanism by which fair employment practices must
be incorporated into American industry if the goal of equal
employment opportunity is to ba achieved,
QUESTION:

Nov/, you've been talking so far* Hr,

Goldstein* about the congressional purposes.

What are we to

decide the case on, the congressional purposes or the language
of the statute?
The language of the statute is that a charge shall ha

10
filed within 90 days after the alleged unlawful employment
r

practice occurred.

Now, that's not ambiguous, is it?

HR. GOLDSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Mo, Mr. Chief Justice Burger.

The —

Now, recently, when Congress amended that?

after this, your case, was under way, there was no change
except changing it from 90 days to 180 days, and the language
is repeated, “shall be filed”, mandatory language, "within
180 days after the alleged unlawful practice, employment
practice occurred.”

That’s on page 3 of your Petition for

Cert, 2 and 3.
How do we ~~ how much emphasis should we place upon
the purposes when the language is clear, if it is clear?
MR. GOLDSTEIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, we would submit

that that language speaks to the amount of time someone would
have to file a charge once the limitation period begins to run..
It doesn’t
QUESTION:
it?

Well, it doesn’t say that, though, does

It says 90 days after the practice, the event has

occurred; and the event was what?

The discharge, was it not?

MR. GOLDSTEIN; Well, under our first theory, we
would say that the last occurrence was not until the termina­
tion of the review procedure of the initial decision to
\

dir

on November 18, when the Personnel

Director of the company denied Mrs. Guy’s third-step grievance.
QUESTION;

But, as Justice Stevens’ question

11
suggested^ if you then were to use other remedies,, it might
be a long, long time before the period would begin to run on
your theory.

Is that not. so?

MR. GOLDSTEIN5

Well; the grievance arbitration

procedure in American industry is generally geared to a very
short period of time, approximately ~~ as pointed out in the
reply brief of the union

90 percent of th© collective

bargaining agreements have provisions such as th® one her©,
where «die maximum period of time to — the decision to go to
arbitration could be 35 days.
Also, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe in our reply
brief we pointed to the statute of limitations periods in
the

that war© discussed in the Burnett case, and also in

the Midp tub© c-ns©, which were as mandatory as the statute in
this case; but, nevertheless, the Court said that those
mandatory tine periods did not preclude the application of
equitable considerations to a decision as to when those
tin?;.' periods would begin to run.
QUESTION:

Was this approach, that your first approach

presented to the lower courts?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Justice Whits, the argument which

basically depends upon the Hoc re v. Sunbeam Corp, was stated
to the Sir.\h Circuit.

The pertinent language in Moore v.

Sunbeam Coro, v;ss cited bo thv Sixth circuit.

We did not

ulate it as a separate argument, as we do her®.

v

12

QUESTION:

You never argued to. the courts below

that termination, did not occur until the grievance procedure
was concluded?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Mr. Justice White, we did not.

We just cited the pertinent language in Moors v. Sunbeam Corn,
to the Sixth Circuit.
While Mr. Newman will discuss the grievance
arbitration procedure at some length, I would like to briefly
state, contrary to respondent's argument, why the Court's
opinion in Alexander requires tolling.
In Alexander, the Court, considered the conflict or
rather the accommodation of two paramount federal policies:
fier employment practices, and industrial self-government.
The Court, in Alexander, by its ruling, was pointing
out that the procedure for the resort to the law of the shop
and the law of the land should supplement, ©ach other.
Repeatedly the Court pointed out that a proper grievance
arbitration procedure could effectively assist in implementing
Title VII, and even indicated that under certain circumstances
evidence gathered in that process could be used by the district
court.
In conclusion, this Court has delineated at some
length th«.. law enforcing the policy cf equal employment.

In

Griggs and Albemarle P?per Company, unlawful practices were
defined

13
In Albemarle Paper Company and Franks v. Cowman
Trans parfc;tf on jTorapany , the requirements of adequate remedy
were discussed.
In this case the Court has the opportunity * by
reversing the Sixth Circuitt to encourage -the full implementa­
tion of these decisions into the law of the shop,, where, with
the continued spur of. court decisions, it would make the
goal of equal employment opportunity a reality.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.

Mr. Newman„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WINN NEWMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNION
MR. NEWMAN:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
Mr. Goldstein has articulated the legal theories
supporting our view that.the charge was filed timely.
i should like to make one additional comment with
respect to the first point, namely, -the date on which the
violation occurred, and then devote the remainder of my time
the equitable considerations with respect to the tolling
issue.
In the industrial world, it’s well understood that a
first-level foreman’s decision is hardly the last ward.

This

generally results, or may result in a request from the union

.14

for a review of that decision which the foreman's action has
triggered, and that decision is then, as you. know, reviewed
and culminates into review -through various steps of grievance
procedures, including high-ranking company and union officials
QUESTIONS At what time does the pay stop?
MR. NEWMAN:

The pay stops, in the case of a

discharge, in most cases, immediately.

Not in all cases, but

in most cases? and it did stop in this case immediately.
However, the decision is not an appeal kind of thing,
it's not an appeal to upper steps, it's a review by other
management to determine whether the action is consistent with
the company policy or the union contract.

And that, I submit,

is the way in which it is looked at in the industrial world.
New, —
QUESTION:

May I ask you this, Mr. Newman:

Am I

correct in my understanding that when the grievance was first
filed there was no claim at all of racial discrimination?
MR. NEWMAN:

The grievance was filed with a charge

of unfair action, but that is not untypical of grievances
th at are f i le d.
QUESTION:

Well, sura I — did I

you're telling

me I mis understood it?
MR. NEWMAN:

No, you understood it — the language,

used in the grievance did not allege racial discrimination.

‘el discrimination. "Now, —

15
MR® NEWMiiM:

However, a grievance that alleges

unfair actions does include any kind of unfair action, as held
by arbitrators in legion, which includes race discrimination,
sex discrimination, or any other kind of disparate treatment.
QUESTION: But there was no. identification of racial
dis crimination.
MR. NEWMAN:

There was no identification of it.

But —

QUESTION: Should that make a difference, do you
think?
In other words, would not

let's say the grievance

was specifically that there had bean a violation of some
quite different and unrelated provision of the collective
bargaining agreement, nothing whatever to do with racial or
sexual or age dis crimination, and that had been processed?
would that make a difference in your argument?

Wouldn’t that

detract from some of your argument, from the point of view of
both the tolling and the finality of th® grievance procedure —
MR. NEWMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I suppose it might —— if it had been based on a wholly

different inquiry than the one that the — that has to be
undertaken if there's a claim of racial discrimination?
MR. NEWMAN:

I suppose it might, if it’s a totally

different grievance. We submit that in this case, this grievance
of unfair action did in fact caver any kind of unfair treatment
relating to her discharge.

16

QUESTIONS

Rufe in the grievance procedure, was there

any focus on racial discrimination at all?
MR, NEWMAN;

The grievance procedure itself is not

in the record, what took place in that grievance procedure,,
as you know, is a very informal process.

So there's no record

of what took place.
But the company, too,, both sides have the burden of
establishing the facts on the way up through the grievance
procedure.

Ana it would be —
QUESTION:

Yes,

Well, I just wondered if the

company really is on notice,

if 'there’s no — if it’s not

if there’s no focus, no inquiry into racial discrimination
whatsoever during this grievance procedure,
MR, NEWMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, the —
No notice to the company of any such

claim,
MR, NEWMAN:

The employer has notice of what the

union is alleging in the grievance procedure. There is no —*
no formal record that we have.

The issue came up in the

grievance procedure, but, you know, I could tell you that it’s
in the record — obviously I can’t do that,
QUESTION:

It’s not in the record, and we don't

know —
MR, NEWMAN:

But I can say that if this issue had

gone before an arbitrator v/ifch a charge of unfair action, an

17
arbitrator would fully consider any kind of unfair action
including race discrimination,,
QUESTION: Well, he hardly would, if. it were not even
suggested to him that that might have been the reason for the
discharge, would he?
MR» NEWMAN;

lie would consider it if it came before

him in the form of evidence»
QUESTION:
MR. NEWMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. NEWMAN:

Yes, if it came before him.
Sure.
Yes.
That*s right.

And in this case, this is the unfair charge, it*s
a typical way — there are many contracts indeed that prohibit
&. grievance from being filed if you allege race or sex
discrimination.

It's not arbitrable.

The General Electric

contract, for example, provides that you can griev on that but
you cannot arbitrate on that, with the result that our union
typically files a grievance and does not allege race or sex
crimination, because as soon as we allege that, it no
longer becomes arbitrable.
Nevertheless, the issue goes before the arbitrator
in. tin context of just cause.

Because whether you view this as

race discrimination or sex discrimination, you corns out to the
same place, if the tfeatraeat is disparate; which is the basic
fundamental of arbitration law

18

C;U'2;v;>.'X0IT: '-Wj.le I chink perhaps you”understand v?hat
was behind, my question, in any event, that if there is no
notice to the

employer at all that this is going to turn in,

ultimately, to a claim under Section VII, then perhaps some
of the force of your argument disappears»
*

MR, NEWMAN:

I submit, Your Honor, that there had

been many charges of discrimination filed under Title VII
against this employer.
QUESTION 5

Titie VII.

MR» NEWMAN:

There had been EEOC determinations

against this employer.

This has been a heavily black plant.

It can be assumed, in such cases, I think, that any time you
have discharge of black employees, this is liable to be an
issue, and ihi.ra is some burden on the employer to determine
whether that is a factor as well.
DIES TION: When the EEOC issued its right-tc-sue
letter, concluding that there wss no discrimination, racial
discrimination, was the employer informed of that circumstance?
MR. NEWMAN:

The employer would, in the normal course

of things, get a copy of that determination, yes, Your Honor.
*
•r

QUESTION: So the employer was entitled to draw some
inferences at that time as to status of the matter, was he not?
I,NEWHAN:

That was after, of course, the grievance

had been dropped, that that determination issued.
QUESTION:

Mr. Newman, the petitioner was discharged

19

on October 25, could she hava filed a claim immediately, on
October 26, with EEOC?
MR. NEWMAN:

Yas, vie would argue that she can file

that claim, but she is wot required to do so at that time,
because, although some action has been taken against her and
she is no longer on the payroll, the decision is still under
review.
Let me suggest in this regard that if the employer
treated this as a final decision, and approached the subsequent
steps of the grievance procedure with that in mind, and failed
to approach the subsequent steps of the grievance procedure
with an open mind, he wnld be in violation of Section 8(a)(5)
of the National Labor Relations Act.
I suggest that that requires that, to the extant he
is required to com© to the table with an open mind, he can't
just come endf as you suggested, asked about earlier, Mr.
Chief Justice, just sit there? he has to come there with an
open mind and give a o© novo review of whether the conduct
warranted 'the results that were imposed, whether it be to
sustain it, reverse it or compromise it.
And these grievance meetings are hardly perfunctory,
mitigating circuit©tances would be considered.

Other courts

have held, as has been suggested, that the grievance does not
occur until the grievances, procedure is exhausted.

In Butler

vs. Teamsters, 514 Fed 2d 442, for example, the Eighth Circuit

20
stated that common sense indicates that there is no approval
until all facts have been learned, including those obtained
during grievance procedures.
Hew, that has been upheld by other courts — by a
recent district court in Ohio*
And I would like just briefly to touch upon tolling,
and comment that if you find the occurrence took

place at the

time of. on October 25th rather than the third step of the
grievance procedure, there is substantial equitable grounds
to toll iri this casa.
Aside from the federal policy, or, rather, to be in
accord with the federal policy, articulated in Alexander and
numerous coses, it’s clear that the non-discrimination matters
arc going to have to bo handled through the grievance procedure..
The success rate is far greater in arbitration»
It's six times as great as before EEOC in discharge cases,
more than six times„ The retention rate is more than two times
the ro.ee of people restored by the NLRB, and we don’t have
figures for EEOC*
QUESTION:

Mr* Newman, let me interrupt, because I’m

troubled by the same points that apparently Justice Stewart
had in mind*
For your argument really to be sound, should you not
also have the burden of showing that’ the grievance procedure
and the arbitration procedure focused on the charge of discrim-

21
ination?

Isrt* t that pari of what Judge? Tuttle had in mind in

Culpepper and the other asses that followed Culpepper?
I nay be wrong, I don’t —- I haven't, re-read those
cases» But if you don't have that, doss your argument really
hold water?
MR» NEWMAN:

Well, —

QUESTION: And the second part of my question, just so
I have it ail out is, if that's relevant, who should have the
burden of showing whether the arbitration did involve racial
dis crimination?
MR, NEWMAN: Well, in terms of arbitral law, both
parties have the burden of bringing out all the facts and
discussing them with an open mind, as I said earlier, and
discussing them as a grievance, during the grievance procedure.
So that —
QUESTION: But you’re saying that the employer should
have the burden of showing, under a general charge should
always corae in with evidence that 'there was no racial
motivation? is that what you’re saying?
<

MR. NEWMAN:

Under a general charge you can always

come in with evidence that there is racial discriminatior.
QUESTION:

I understand that, but the question — if

it is relevant Lo know whether or not the arbitration involved
racial dis crimination, who should the judge put the burden on
to explain whether or not that was part of the arbitration

22

process?
Her® we have a silent record, as I understand*
{

MR. NEWMANj

Wall, we subro.it that the charge of

unfair includes any kind of disparate treatment.
QUESTION?

Well, I understand, in terms of that

you could bring it out before the arbitrator.
MR. NEWMAN:

All right.

So that I think we have

met that burden when we file — when a grievance is filed which
alleges unfair treatment.

It alleges disparate treatment on

all grounds, including race discrimination.
QUESTION:

Well, that's in every single grievance,

involving a firing, isn't it?

Isn't that always going to be

the claim, that it was unfair?
HR. NEWMAN;

Well, not always.

There may be other

factors.
QUESTION: Well, I can't — it's hard to think of any
other.

I men, because that's such a broad generic covering-

hhe-waterfront term, and that's what it is always going to be,
isn’t it?
MR. NEWMAN:

Well, you know, maybe absenteeism or

something of that sort.

There’s lots of other things,, that

result in discharge.
QUESTION:

Wall, it’s not the employee, the griever

is never going to say Ml was fired for absenteeism", he’s
goiug to say, "I was fired

unfairly."

Then the employer is

23
going to respond, "Well, the fact is you were fired for
absenteeism»"
So, isn't that always going to be generically the
charge?
MR. NEWHAM:

1 think when you have a plant with, this

kind of racial breakdown and with the large number of EEOC
charges that existed, you do have a burden on an employer to
look at race discrimination, where he’s agreed to do so in
his affirmative action plan and conciliation agreements.
Thank you.
QUESTION: Well, what’s your answer to Justice
Stewjirt*s quesfelon?
QUESTION:

Or to Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

Or to Justice Stevens* question.

1 don't

think you’ve answered either one of them.
Isn’t it always going to be a claim of disparate
treatment?
MR. NEWMAN:
treatment.

It will net always be disparate

There will be other factors, mitigating circum­

stances, length of service, employee should get another chanca,
end good work record, and so forth.
But, as distinguished from time act that has taken
place.

But "unfair" in the industrial —* I cannot say it any

differently, that "unfair" would include race discrimination.
1

And clearly, if it had gone to arbitration, that would have been

an issue.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court;
I move that Fletcher L, Hudson of the State of
Tennessee b© permitted to present oral argument pro hac vice
in this ease on behalf of the respondents.

I am satisfied

he possesses the necessary qualifications.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Newman.

Your motion will be granted, and we’ll be glad to hear from
Mr. Hudson in this case.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLETCHER L. HUDSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HUDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas© the

Court;
First of all, we disagree with the petitioners here
as to the is sum before this Court.

We submit that the issues

her© are net as complicated and complex as they have made it
out in their argument.
Thera was only on® issue decided by the district
court in this case.

There was only on© issue that was briefed

on the merits by both parties in the Court of Appeals.

And

Cher® was only one issue decided by the Court of Appeals.
Luc that i.r■■■■■: :* was simply whether or not the filing of a
grieve area - uerr a x>Ilectiv© bargaining contract operator: to
ccvcsnb or toll the

for filing the charge with the EEOC.

25

d we contend that this is the only issue that is
properly before this Cwurfe„
Wow, the f??ct3, -'aa have been noted, are basically
undisputed and simpIs»
This employe® was discharged on October the 25th and
she. did not file a charge until 108 days from the date of her
discharge»
Now, she filed s grievance, or had a grievance filed
on her behalf that alleged a violation of the contract, as she
claimed the discharge was unfair.
The union decided not to take this case to arbitra­
tion, and nothing happened on this grievance from the date it
was denied by the employer —• nothing happened after that
point, and nothing happened until the employee filed a charge
with EEOC.
Nov, it's interesting to note here that the plaintiff,
when she filed her case in the district court, alleged two
claims. She alleged a claim under 1866 civil Rights Act, and
she alleged n claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964»

In

the argument on the motion to dismiss her claim under -the 1866
Civil Rights Act, which was granted — the motion to dismiss
was granted — the plaintiff defended her failure to file her
4k

lawsuit within the one-year State statute of limitations on
the ground that, the time of her filing of the EEOC charge had
tolled the time for her filing of this lawsuit under 1866»

26

Iii the argument on the dismissal or the motion to
dismiss the Titi® VII claim,, she took the position and the
sol© position that the filing of the grievance tolled the time
for filing the charge with EEOC.
The district court rejected these arguments and
dismissed both of these claims*

The plaintiff appealed -the

claim under Title VII, and the, as I noted before# Court of
Appeals, deciding the issue of tolling and relying on -this
Court's decision in Alexander and in Johnson, affirmed the
dismissal by the district court.
Nowt the petitioners and the respondent in this case
basically agree on -fell® test that should be applied by this
Court in deciding this issue. And the test is:

whether or

not the failure to apply tolling would be inconsistent with the
federal policy underlying the cause of action under considera"
tion.

We both agree that this is the basic test that

should apply.
Now# what we disagree on her® is two things;
No. 1, what is this federal policy?
And No. 2, would it be inconsistent with this federal
policy to refuse to apply tolling?
Now. this Court# in Alexander and in Johnson# had
several things to say about this federal policy, that we
contend should control the answer to the first question*
This Court stated that the underlying policy7 of

27
Tifcl© VII was to provide Title VTI remedies as parallel and
overlapping to any other remedies chafe might be available*
The Court also stated that the policy underlying
Title VII was that the EEOC and the courts shoiald have the
preferred rol® in resolving claims of discrimination# and not
arbitrators and grievance procedures.
The Court stated that the procedures of Title VII
should foe given full play and should not be made dependent on
what 'might happen in a grievance or arbitration procedure *
The Court also noted in Alexander that -the underlying
policy of Title VII was that precise jurisdictional prerequi­
sites must be met before an individual will be able to assert
a claim under Title VII„

And one of these prerequisites is the

timely filing of a charge with EEOC*
Now# we can see nothing inconsistent with these
policies# to refuse to apply tolling in this case*

And we

have beard nothing from the petitioners that suggests 'that
there is anything inconsistent, with -these policies to require
this employee to file her charge within 90 days.
The basic position of the petitioners seem to be
that it would be preferable to suspend Title VII remedies and
the remedies under Title VII so that the arbitration and
grievance procedure will be given a chance to work.

They

:e the position that these two remedies are so
interrelated end dependent that what happens in. ona, in the

28
purs ail; of or:® remedy will nece^s arily affect what happens in
another»
These

saws- arguments ware made in this Court in

Alexander and in Johnson- and were, rejected by this Court.
Their principal argument is that to require an
employee to file a grievance or to file an EEOC charge while
a grievance is pending would in some way interfere with the
national policy that encourages the settlement of labor
disputes through grievance: and arbitration»
Now, we submit that this has not been shown to be the
case, or that we take the position that there would be no
substantial interference with the grievance and arbitration
procedure to require an employe® to file an EEOC charge
within 180 days under the new lew.
In any event, we take the position that it's not
the policy underlying the national labor laws that should be
considered here, it's the policies underlying Title VII that
should control, whether or not tolling should apply.
The petitioners in their brief took the position that;
allowing tolling to take placa will encourage the settlement
of disputes, that will discourage the filing of charges with
the EEOC, and will cut down on the work of the EEOC.
This Court# in Alexander# answered this argument by
stating that Congress intended for the Commission, and the
courts to handle clsi.wa of discrimination# and not arbitrators.

29
Contrary ho this argument;, Congress did not intend
to discourage charges with the EEOC, they intended to encourage
charges,

And we see nothing inconsistent with the policies

underlying Titi® VII to require an employee to file a charge
with EEOC,
QUESTION:

Mr, Hudson, is not the purpose of the

filing with th® EEOC to try and seek voluntary adjustment of
the matter without resort to the courts?

And if that is

correct, is it not consistent with that purpose also to
exhaust arbitration first?
MR, HUDSON:

Wo do not feel it is consistent with

that. purpose to ©Fhaust arbitration, because arbitration and
grievance procedures are basically between unions and companies.
Oftentimes the unions are alleged as the perpetrators of
discrimination with the company, and they were in this case.
And the purposes underlying Title VII and the filing of the
charge is to have the Commission's conciliation procedures to
hak& effect.

And the fact that other efforts are taken —

QUESTION: Vary simply stated, the purpose is to try
and forestall litigation, try to male® it unnecessary to go to
court, isn’t it?
MR, HUDSON: Well, if the purpose is not — I don’t
necessarily agree with that.

I think the purpose is to bring

into play the procedures under Title VII, to try to bring about
conciliation, and hops -that ~~

30

QUESTION: But the EEOC has no power other than to
try and got the parties to work it out, isn't that right?
MRo HUDSON:

That's correct»

That's correct»

But we feel that the procedures under — I mean, the
basic argument that this tolling will allow for the settlement
of disputes is not an argument in support of tolling, because
the basic purpose of. Title'VII is to have the EEOC and the
courts handle these cases and not unions and employers who are
oftentimes toooth&r the perpetrators of discrimination,
f
QUESTION: Mr. Hudson, does the collective
bargaining agreement in this case contain any provisions with
respect to its tims periods, with respect to concluding
grievance proceedings, or the filing of grievance proceedings,
or the going to arbitration; is there any schedule of limita­
tion period within the bargaining agreement itself?
MR. HUDSONs Thera is a time limit in which a party
has to taka a grievance from the final step in the th5;i*d
step —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, HUDSON:

— tc arbitration, yes.

QUESTION;

What is that?

MR. HUDSON:

I think it’s ten days in this case.

x don't recall that — tan or fifteen days.
QUESTION;

Is there any time limitation on filing

the initial grievance?

31
MR. HUDSON:

Thar® is a time limit; on filing the

initial grievance of five days.

And that —

QUESTION: After the final step , arbitration must be
initiated within ten days?

MR. HUDSON; The request for arbitration must be
initiated within ten days.

Now, many times, under any contract,

— under this contract there is no time limit on how long it
would be before -the arbitrator rendered a final decision.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HUDSON: As a 'matter of fact, in this particular
plant we had one grievance go to arbitration and we never got ein
answer from the arbitrator; it's still pending.

It has been

pending for about five years.
So — this was one of th© points I wished to make,
that these collective bargaining contracts ar© all different.
There are

or contracts between unions and

companies with different time limits for taking grievances

to

arbitration, taking -- filing of the grievances and what has
#

to be alleged, and the procedures in handling these grievances.
To allow tolling will causa complicated and complex
issues that will have to b® decided by the EEOC and the
courts, and their work in trying to decide these issues, wo
feel, would detract from their principal objective of trying
to oliminat© racial discrimination.
Idstein stated, this grievance procedure

32

involved here* is relatively short»

In most grievance

procedures, you know within a very short period of tin® whether
t

or not this grievance procedure will bring about a settlement
of your particular claim,,
We contend that 180 days is ample time for an employee
to know whether or not their grievance will bring about an
adjustment. They have plenty of time, even if they wanted to
wait until after the grievance procedure? to file a claim with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can
daw lop procedures of deferral, such as the procedures
developed by the National Labor Relations Board, which will
minimize xa;my of the problems the petitioners contend will
take* place, if tolling is not permitted to occur.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hudson, you just referred to the 180-

dry provision.
MR. HUDSON;
QUESTION;

Yes.
I talc© it you are not receding from your

position that the amendment does not apply to 'this claim as
filed?
MR. HUDSON;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Your Honor.
Is it true, however, that when the

amendment was effected, she still could have filed the day
after the amendment and been on time, and you would have no
defense to that filing?

33
MR. HUDSON s

Our position is that she could not

have filed after tie amendment became effectives, of March the
24 th # 1972«,

It was still within ISO days from the data of

her discharge# but we contend -that she — Congress has

no

power to give her 'the right to file a charge over a claim that
has been extinguished, or has never com® into existence.
QUESTIONi Despite the language of the amendment that
it -MR. HUDSON: The language of the amendment applies to
all charges filed thereafter# and all pending charges.

Now#

if she had filed a charge therafter, we contend that that would
be beyond -the power of the Congress # to give her this right
to file a charge, if it. occurred more than 90 days prior to
th© effective date of the amendment.
QUESTION: Well# aren’t you really saying# then# that
the amendment applies to all events that — all occurrences
that took place after the amendment?
MR. HUDSON:

Yes„ that’s our position.

QUESTION:

On that interpretation.

QUESTION;

So you’re driven to th© position -that har

charge# her incident; was completely extinguished, and even if
she had not; filed the charge# end even though it was within
ISO days# she could not now file the charge?
MR. HUDSON: That’s correct.
QUESTION:

Even —

So that she could net have filed the

34
charge between March 24th and April 22nd of that year?
MR. HUDSON: She could not have filed feh© charge —
that's our first position on that. Because ~~
QUESTION:

And you say Congress was without power

to allow her to do so?
MR. HUDSON:
QUESTION:

Without what, constitutional power?
Without constitutional power, because

Under what provision of the Constitution?

Or what inhibition of the Constitution?
MR. HUDSON: We contend that this would be a . violation
of the Fifth .Amendment, due process of law.

That this is a

situation that as of the data of the amendments, March the
24th- there was no right in existence and no liability in
existence as of that date.
Congress cannot legislate rights and liabilities
based on conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of
fch& amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hudson, couldn't the defendant

waive the statute of limitations?
MR. HUDSON: We feel like the defendant could not
waive the statute of limitations.
QUESTION:

You think it's a non-waivable defense,

th:3 statute of limitations?

That's a remarkable position.

MR.HUDSON s

This —

QUESTION:

Under the Fifth Amendment, 1 guess.

HR. HUDSON; Hall, we would contend that the Court

35
would have; no jurisdiction over the subject matter of this
claim because no charge was filed.

And the filing of a charge

is a prerequisite to the very existence of the right and
liability.
QUESTION: Well, that’s true as a matter of statute,
but what authority do you rely on for the proposition that the
Fifth Amendment would prevent Congress from accomplishing this
result, if it chose to do so?
MR. HUDSON: We rely on this Court’s decision in the
Danger case, that was cited in our brief, that has later been
distinguished in other situations, where the statute of
' insi t:\tioKs goes

po

the remedy only and not to the right.

Rut we contend that the Panzer decision that we've
cited stands for this proposition.

And we also contend that

even if Congress did have the power to legislate these rights,
they did not legis lata the rights in this case, because the
1372 amendments do not apply to this situation. They can only
apply if this charge was pending, and this charge was not
pending
QUESTION;

Well, lot’s see, Mr. Hudson, I gather,

on your submission, the 90 days ran out on January 25?
MR. HUDSON;
QUESTIONs

Approximately, yes.
But there was a complaint filed on

February 10 fch.
MR. HUDSON:

That's correct.

36

QUESTION: And you say that, I gather- that ESOC
could not accept on February 10 the complaint which in fact
EEOC did accept; but you say it had no authority to accept?
MR. HUDSON:

Had no authority to accept.

QUESTION: And therefore the complaint filed on
February 10, although still with the Commission on March 24#
was not pending for the purposes of the * 72 amendments j is
that your argument?
MR. HUDSON: That's our position.
And we would also point out —QUESTION: And we have to accept all of those
propositions to agree with you, don’t we?
MR. HUDSON:

Yes, and you also have to decide that

you have this issue before the Court.
QUESTION: Well, that's because, 1 gather, as I under­
stand it, th© Sixth Circuit refused to reach this question —
MR. HUDSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
—

on the ground that although amicus/--

I gather EEOC is amicus — had suggested it# it had not been
tendered by the petitioners?
MR. HUDSON:

Our position is that it was not before

the Court because a party did not raise the issue.
QUESTION:
MR. HUDSON:

That's what I say.
And the second thing —

QUESTION: Rut it. was tendered by EEOC as amicus,

37
wasn't; it'
MR. HUDSON:
QUESTIONs

But not in the district court.
Yes.

MR. HUDSON:

It was not. before the district court

for decision, it was not briefed on the merits by the partias
in the Court of Appeals.
Now, I would also point out that this employe®, when
she filed her charge on February, stated that the most recant

data -—
QUESTION:

Was January 29.

MR. HUDSON:
29th.

— of discrimination was January the

Now
QUESTION: But you say there's nothing in the record

to support that allegation?
MR. HUDSON:

There's nothing ever been suggested

that any discrimination occurred on that date.

If she had

not misrepresented this fact -~
QUESTION: Then EEOC would not have taken it.
MR. HUDSON:

~~ they would not. have taken it.

QUESTION:

Well, that's surmise, isn't it, you

don't know whether they would or not?

MR. HUDSON: Well, under their procedures, we have to
assume they would not.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION 5

Mr. Hudson, let m© get. to my question that

38
has spawned these other ones.

Suppose -the occurrence took

place 30 days before the '72 amendment.

Thirty days.

How long would she have to file, 60 or 120 days?
MR. HUDSON; W® contend that she would have
QUESTION;
MR. HUDSON:

Or 180 days?
-- 90 days to file.

Sixty more days.

QUESTION; Despit® th© interposition of the '72
amendment?
MR. HUDSON; well, this argument, I’m not, frankly
solid on this.

If the ■— I*ra not —* I can't really answer your

question directly.

From a constitutional standpoint, it

may b© that she could file 180 days later.

But I would

hava to take the position
QUESTION;
MR. HUDSON;

I'm thinking of statutory
—■ that, to be consistent, that she

could not file after 60 days.
QUESTION;

Well, it's certainly your argument that

tha limitation is a condition of the right itself.

You

couldn't suggest 180 days would b® applicable.
MR. HUDSON:
QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.
Is it really accurat® to say that the

Court of Appaals didn’t consider this issue?

Judge Welch's

opinion says that it's a new issue which was not raised by
tho plaintiff in ths district court — I'm looking at pagas
8a and Sa of the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari.

39

Bub then he goes along and in two or three or four short
paragraphs. he does discuss -the issue and dispose of it,
doesn't he?

On the merits„

MR. HUDSON:

That is correct.

In the first

part of that decision, he attempts to make it clear that there
was only one issue for decision.
QUESTION:

Yes»

HR. HUDSON: And he does go ahead and decide the
issue without the benefit of the respondent's argument on the
merits of that issue.
QUESTION: But the Court of Appeals did deal with
the issue and dispose of it on the merits.

Do you give it

the same reading as I do?
MR. HUDSON: Well, they discussed the issue — I do
not feel that they decided the issue.

I do not feel they

actually decided the issue. They said, in effect, that "if we
were to decide this issue, we would decide such-and-such",
and that’s the basis of their decision.
QUESTION; Nell, he ends up the discussion with;
"The subsequent increase of hirae to file the charge enacted
by Congress, could not revive plaintiff's claim which had
previously been barred and extinguished."

That seems -to ra®

& fairly unambiguous conclusion*
MR. HUDSON: They reached that conclusion —
QUESTION: But he doesn't say, "if we did decide the

40

issue, we would decide it that way”•
MR. HUDSON: That may be true, Your Honor.

It's

really unclear in
QUESTION:

But Judge Edwards5 dissent is squarely

on the 180-day point, isn’t it?
QUESTION:
MR. HUDSON:

Yes.
And that is a point, I thinkf that should

b© noted. Judge Edwards * dissent states that they should not
decide the issue, but send it back to the district court and
let the district court decide it.
In effect# that’s his dissent.

They should send the

case back to the district court*
I would like to say, concerning th© argument teat
the discharge was not a final act until the termination of
the grievance procedure, that, as I stated earlier, this is ~~
there is also t. question her® of whether or not this issue
is properly before the Court.
Te contend that this issue was raised for the first
time and briefed to this Court, and under -this Court’s rules
and policies, it. should not be considered since it was not
considered by the courts below.
But, in any ©vent, we contend that a discharge of an
©raploy®© is a final end completed act.

It was a final and

completed act in this particular case, there was nothing left
to be done.

The only thing left to be don© was a question of:

41
whether or res rhe company would change its mind.
Kev, th© company still has this question, they can
still change their wind, but that, dues not make the discharge
not a final complete act.

The denial of the grievance was

also a final act and completed. ■ It was a separate act.
The employee- could have- filed an EEOC charge over the denial
of the grievance.
The employe© filed a charge over the discharge of
the employee, and it should be noted also that the plaintiff’s
complaint in the district court alleged that this discharge
occurred oi October the 25th.. 1971.

So v?® contend that this

iit does not lend any assistance to the petitioner's
case here.
la conclusion, we contend that the only issue
before tils Court is whether or not tolling should apply.
And based

coo policies of this Court., w© contend it would

not be incensis lent with the policies underlying Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act to refuse to apply tolling.

And since it

would not be inconsistent, we contend that the decision of
the court below should be affirmed.
Thank you.

MR, NEWMHJ:

QUESTION:

Well,apart from — if you want to win

your lawsuit, you might try to help us with the 180-day.
MR, NEWMAN:

Yes, Well, we think, as we’ve said in

our briefs, we thought it was fully briefed there, that the
180-day provision, applies in this case, and that the grievance,
clearly is timely on that basis? no question about our thinking
on that score.

'-To, wc fully support it, end did.

I would like to point out, though, that the complaint

That the company was silent

in its response, it never argued that, on the argument it’s

it didn't argue that it was prejudiced by the delay; and we
submit that, since the statute of limitations is a defense,
that the burden

has the obligation to prove all those elements,

and, at worse, this case should be remanded on that matter»
Secondly, I want to make clear that we are not. in
