MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76“99* Occidental Life Insurance Company of California
against Equal Employment Opportunity Commission»
Mr, Vaughn»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS H. VAUGHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» VAUGHN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held
below that the EEOC has infinity within which to sue on an
individual charge of discrimination.

In other words, that

there is no time limitation, whatsoever, upon that agency,
a position advocated by the EEOC to that court.
Now, the Ninth Circuit so held in the context of a
suit alleging wide-ranging practices and acts of sex discrimin­
ation against both females and males, a suit that was predi­
cated upon a single charge of discrimination filed by one
individual female protesting her discharge, which she claimed
to be discriminatory.

And that discharge occurred some t’-.ree

years and four months prior to the date upon which the EEOC’
got into the Federal District Court with its complaint.
Now, it is Petitioner's position that infinity is
not and cannot be the only parameter on the EEOC's right to sue.
First, it is our position that inherent in the statute

4
Itself is a 180-day limitation on the right to sue granted to
the EEOC by that statute.
And* secondly* it is our position that if* in fact*
there is no federal limitation*then the most analogous state
statute of limitation governs the EEOC's right to bring suit.
QUESTION:

I notice in the briefs here nobody seems

to have identified the most analogous state statute or argued
about which one it might be.
MR. VAUGHN:
QUESTION:
MR, VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.
Where., in California?
That is right.
So* it x»?ould be a California statute if

your second argument is correct.
MR. VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

That is right, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Then, might it be a different statute

if it's one for money, back pay, from what it might be if it
were only for an injunction?
MR. VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

L d O' .not know.
In other words, if only for an Injunction,

there would be no statute at all, but the state doctrine of
laches.
MR, VAUGHN:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe there

would be a distinction under California law, under the
California statute, between a suit for injunctive relief and
a suit for back pay.

5
QUESTION:

But there is no identification anywhere

in these briefs that 1 saw of what the most analogous state
statute might be.
MR, VAUGHN:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart* the Court of

Appeals* of course, because of its view that there was no
limitation, whatsoever, did not reach the issue.

The District

Court held that the one-year statute of limitations in
California was applicable, and that was an alternative holding;
in the court's granting of our motion for summary judgment.
The District Court had held that there was a 180--day federal
limitation in Title 7 and alternatively that the one-year
statute of limitations, under California law, was applicable.
QUESTION:
MR. VAUGHN:
QUESTION:
MR. VAUGHN:

What Is that statute, for a penalty or —
That is a —
Is it a catch-all statute or —
That is a statute for wrongful injury.

It is Code of Civil Procedures, Section 3^3* injury caused by
the wrongful act of another.
Now, there is additionally a second statute, Code
of Civil Procedures, Section 3381, \A/hich is an action upon a
liability created by statute, other than for a penalty or a
forfeiture.
So, it has been our position, it was our position
before the District Court, it was our position before the
Court of Appeals that one of the two statutes itfas applicable.

6
Regardless of which applied, the suit was barred,,
QUESTION:

Each was a one-year statute?

*

’

MR. VAUGHN:

No, 1 am sorry, the first for wrongful

injury was one year»
QUESTION:

The second statute is three years»
How long elapsed here?

It would have

been barred even by the three-year statute?
MR» VAUGHN:
Rehnquist.

Yes, that is right, Mr» Justice

The complaint was filed over three years and four

months from the date upon which the discriminatory act occurred,
being the discharge of the charging party, Tamar Ed els on, on
or about October 1, 1970.
QUESTION:

Suit was filed on February 22, 197^»

It then was a pattern or practice suit.,

wasn't it?
MR» VAUGHN:

Mr» Justice Stewart, when the suit was

brought, yes, it was ~~ I don't know whether pattern and
practices is quite the right word.

It was not an Attorney

General suit under the old pattern and practice provisions of
the '64 Act, but it did allege wide-ranging acts and practices
of discrimination by the Petitioner against both female
employees and male employees, going all the way back to the
effective date of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.
QUESTION:
was filed, wasn't it?

But, all the way up to the time the suit
All the way forward in time until the

time the suit was filed.
ing violation?

Wasn't it an allegation of a continu­

7
MR. VAUGHN:

The allegations of the complaint,

Mr. Justice Stewart, yes.
QUESTION:

So when the statute began to run»

It is

your claim that it ran from the discharge of the original
complaining party,,
MR. VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Arguably, it might run from -«■ according

to the Government's allegation -- that it was going on at the
time of the suit.
MR. VAUGHN:

Mr. Justice Stewart, it should be

recognized that nowhere in the pleadings before the District
Court did the EEOC at any time argue that there was a continulng violation.

Furthermore, that argument came into this

proceeding for the first time in a reply brief that was filed
to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,

It does not

appear, I don't bel;.eve, in the brief filed by the agency or
by the Solicitor General with this Court.

But, in any event,

it was raised for the first time, belatedly,' on appeal,,
Now, with respect to the 180-day federal limitation
that limitation is found in Section JOS (f)(1) of the Act »when it is read in the context of the legislative history,
certain portions of which X would like to highlight for the
Court.
Senator Dominick, who was the principal spokesman
for the bill that ultimately passed the Senate, referred to the

8

l80»-day provision as, quote# "the time-period within whicn the
Commission may file a civil action," end of quote»
And Senator Javits referred to it as, quote, "the
allowable time for the Commission to move into a given
situation," end of quote.
Now, these weren't the only ti’jo comments.

Throughout

the legislative history there xvas the very strong expression
by Congress that the eighteen months, that the two years that
it was taking the EEOC then to act was unfair to charging
parties, was a denial to them of justice.

Justice delayed is

justice denied, a phrase seen throughout the legislative
history.
And there was a determination, a very strong con­
viction that this same delay and inaction by the agency was
unfair to Respondent.

And there was a clear congressional

determination in 1972 that this situation had to be changed
in order to prevent it from continuing.
Now, the EEOC has struggled to breath some meaning
into this language, the 180-day language, as an alternative to
our interpretation.

And, thus, the EEOC has argued that

because Congress was aware, in '72, that it took a year or tx»JO
for the EEOC to dispose of charges because there was a backlog,
that Congress couldn't possibly have intended the 180-day
provision as a suit limitation.
And, then, according to the EEOC, the 180-day

9
provision is simply an expression of a private filing re­
striction on the individual victim of discrimination,,
But this position necessarily flounders, both on the.'
expression of congressional intention, but also on logic»

For

this position of the EEOC assumes, first of all, that Congress
intended to build a system in 1972 that would perpetuate, that
would build into the system forevermore the very delays that
it abhorred and was attempting by the new mechanism to eliminate»
And, secondly, the EEOC's position assumes that
Congress made the deliberate choice to extend the period
during which a victim of discrimination could not sue,himself
or herself, even though Congress knew full well that the EEOC,
during that period, would not or could not do anything for
that victim of discrimination»
In other words, Congress in 1972 took the former
30 to 60 restriction on an individual filing suit and extended
it to 180 days.

Now, d3.d Congress extend it just to restrain

the individual from being able to pursue his own rights, if it
knew that the EEOC couldn't or wouldn't do anything?
It simply doesn't make sense.

It's an anomalous

and incongrous intention to attribute to Congress and clearly
at odds with their manifest intention.
QUESTION:

Mr. Vaughn, may I ask a question, just

to get the whole scene in perspective?
MR. VAUGHN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens»

10

QUESTION:

No right to sue letter was issued to the

employee in this case, is that correct?
MR» VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

No formal —
No formal notice»

MR» VAUGHN:

No formal notification»

The record

demonstrates that she was advised that she could bring suit
and she requested that the case be sent to San Francisco,
the EEOC's original litigation office, for consideration as
a Vehicle 4 litigation,
QUESTION:

What I was leading up to is:

Does she

now have a right to sue if she got the right kind of letter
from the EEOC?

Would she be barred?

MR» VAUGHN:

If a right to sue letter now was issued?

Well, I would say, certainly not, Mr, Justice Stevens»
QUESTION:
MR» VAUGHN:

She would not be barred?
She would be barred, that she ’would not

have the right to sue at this juncture.

The fact is that it

is quite academic, X would say, to Ms» Ed els on.

The record

will reflect that she was reinstated in her job six days after
the charge was filed, and thereafter she Voluntarily terminated.
QUESTION:
differently:

Let me put the question a little

If, instead of suing,itself, the EEOC had issued

the appropriate letter to her, could she then have brought a
suit, even though a couple of years had gone by?
MR. VAUGHN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the question you

11

are asking me is what are the conditions to maintenance of
suit by private individual? And that, of course, is not a
question before the Court in this case.
I think the statute -- it read logically in light
of the legislative history — i-vould indicate that the agency
had 180 days in which to act,. Having not acted, a notice of.,
right to sue should have been forwarded, a formal notice ~
which it was not — and then the charging party would have an
additional 90“day period thereafter.
I think, therefore, that Ms. Edelson would not now
have the right to sue.

It is now, after all, almost seven

years from the date of her discharge.

I think that she would

be barred.
QUESTION:

What I am really asking, I suppose is —

because you don't rely on expressed limitation language, but
rather an implied limitation, and the statutory scheme seems
to fit together as you argue it.
But does that also mean that there is a total —
I mean there really is a statutory repose after this period
of time has gone by and the employer can now be sure there is
no litigation coming.
In other words, is there a correlation between the
private right to sue and the Government right to sue?
Or do we have to decide it?
decide it

Maybe we don't have to

12
MR. VAUGHN:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I think I

suggested at the outset that 1 don't think you have to decide
ite

The question is not before you.

I do think, as I indi­

cated ,logically, that you would track the 180-day provision
and the 90-day provision, but, frankly, I can see that the
Court might take a different approach to an individual charging
party who had not received notice of his or her right to sue,
who had been misled by the EEOC.
'While your decision in Johnson v. Railway Express
Agency in which you indicated how little was at stake in that
case, in fact, that the individual was not then able to sue

Because there were continuing violations, new charges could
be brought. -*» That case, I think, could be argued on the pchOi
side of what I{ve indicated, and that is that the right to sue*
would be barred.
I think it is a much more difficult question and —
QUESTION:

The reason I think it may be more

relevant, Mr. Vaughn, is that if you are arguing implicit
limitation, rather than expressed limitations, it seems to me
we must have a pretty clear picture how the whole statutory
scheme fits together.

That's why it was troubling me.

In other words, I think it may be necessary to at
least think that through.
MR. VAUGHN:
the answer is either.

I am not sure what the answer is,

Mr. Justice Stevens, Icm not sure what
I can only say I don't think you need to

13
decide it in this case.
both sides.

And I can see arguments being made or,

I think it is logical that she would be barred,

I believe that Johnson ve REA would tend to support that
conclusion.

On the other hand, I can see the Court taking a

different view, perhaps with respect to an innocent party who
had been misled by the EEOC,
QUESTION:

Mr„ Vaughn, your position is that nobody

can sue Occidental after two years.
MR, VAUGHN:
far.

Do you go that far?

Mr, Justice Marshall, I donct go that

Again, I don6t think the Court needs to reach the

question of under what circumstances a charging party could
bring suit.
Our position goes so far as to say that the EEOC
was prohibited in this case from bringing suit three years
and four months after the discharge in question, whether it
was prohibited by a 180-day federal statute, or whether it
was prohibited by a state statute, the most applicable state
statute,
QUESTION:

But, isn6t that the reverse of what one

would usually think the statute of limitations applies to?
The Government usually has a longer period of limitations or
a Government agency has a longer period of limitation than
a private individual,
MR, VAUGHN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think this,

perhaps, is a unique case because the foundation for what is

14
usually the ease. I believe, normally, would be an interpreta*»
tlon of congressional intention-

Here, Congress was outraged.

Outraged by the delays and the inaction that this agency was
pursuing in the enforcement of the Acto

They intended, I

think it is clear, to put a relatively short time limitation
upon the right to sue,
After all, in this same section, Section 706(f)(1),
there is a provision that the charging party, after receiving
a notice of right to sue, will have 90 days within which to
sue, a lesser time, in fact, than the 180 days.
QUESTION:
party's right here?

Well, why doesn't that govern the charging
Is It that she didn't receive the notice?

MR* VAUGHN:

Well, we have no issue, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, before us as to Ms-Ed els on's
party's — right to do anything.
formal notice of right to sue.

the charging

She did not receive the
The record will demonstrate

that she was advised informally of her right to sue and she
declined to pursue it, requesting that the matter be con­
sidered as a possible litigation vehicle.

And that, of

course, is, in turn, what ended up happening when the EEOC
brought suit, lo, some three years, four months, later.
QUESTION:

Mr„ Vaughn, I am a little concerned about

the practical results.

If you prevail here, then I suppose,

assuming there is sufficient manpower, the EEOC will bring a
lot of suits near the end of the I80*»day period.

15
Is that something that would be beneficial to
employers?

Is it something they really would want?
MR. VAUGHN:

Mr0 Justice Blackmun, I think not only

would employers want that* I think that that is what charging
parties would want»

I think that is what private counsel for

plaintiffs want.
Part of the great problem with the Inaction of the
EEOC is that, quite frankly, from an employer's point of view,
he can take a charge, he can sweep it under the rug because
nobody is asking him or requiring him to make any sort of
decision whatsoever.
languishes.

And under the rug it sits and it

And he is never required to make a judgment:

Now did I make a mistake?

Did I violate the law and what

should I do about it?
And these cases become much harder to settle, quite
frankly, five and six and seven years down the road, when there
is a substantial back pay liability involved, than they are
if you. hit them right up front.
Now, obviously, charging parties would be benefited*
Charging parties now have their charges languishing before the
EEOC, action is not taken.

The EEOC goes out, they have a

charge filed by an individual, alleged discriminee.

Let's say

a racial charge.
At first, the EEOC does not do anything about it and
then it does go out to conduct an investigation, but then it

16
starts Investigating whether there is religious discriminatlor
or sex discriminatIon, whatever else* in addition to the
particular charge of racial discrimination, or minority status
discrimination»
In the meantime, the charging party sits»

And, all

the 'while, the EEOC doesn't issue the 180-day notice that that
charging party has a right to sue.

So he is not or she is not.

pursuing individual rightsQ
It is a very unfair system to charging parties.

It

is a very unfair system to respondents, to employers and it
is a terrible system insofar as the courts are concerned
because the courts are being clogged with stale, time-consuming
cases, going back years and years and years»
QUESTION;

Well, my suggestion was that they might

be clogged even more if you prevail here,
MR, VAUGHN:

You know, I think that's a good

question, Mr, Justice Blackmun, and I think it is not the
case»

I really do believe that a lawyer confronted with a

deadline — We are going to settle this case in 30 days or
we, the EEOC, will file suit.

You've got no choice, as a

lawyer for your client but to turn to look at that ease and
make a judgment»
I think if the EEOC pursued its responsibilities
that there would be more effective conciliation, and there
would be faster action, more cases would be settled, and I

17

don't believe the courts would be clogged*
But, even assuming arguendo that they were,
certainly it would be better to be clogging them with new
cases than cases that are four and five and six years old*
which is the case ■»<=
QUESTION:

Doesn't that also tend to mitigate the

damages, the back pay award?

Shouldn't the employer make a

.judgment very quickly whether he should or should not wash it
out?
MJFU VAUGHN:

I think that's one of the most

important practical points, Mr* Chief Justice, that if you've
made a mistake, that's something you are going to face up to
earlier, much more readily than you are five and six and seven
years down the road,»
And this is the problem*

You don't make those

judgments now because nobody is holding your feet to the fire.
Now, by analogy, let's talk about the National
Labor Relations Board for a moment*

It, of course, has a

different — a cease and desist type authority and that
authority was denied to the EEOC

v

.

But let's take an example of two employees, side by
side, working at machines in a factory.

One employee, a white

employee, is discharged for union activity.

The other employee,

a minority, is discharged because of his race or ethnic origin.
What happens?

The union organizer goes to the

18

National Labor Relations Board and he files a charge»

Within

a median time of 14 days, the investigation is completed»
The charge, having been investigated, the Board finding merit,
a complaint is filed»
tive law judge»

A hearing is held before an administra­

The administrative law judge's decision goes

to the NRLB in Washington»

Court enforcement proceedings are

begun and eventually a Court of Appeals does enforce the order
of the Board for reinstatement and back pay»
That is two and one-half years, according to the
legislative history in connection with these amendments»

Two

and one-half years from the date of the charge with the NLRB
to the final decision of the court»
Now, the proponents of the court enforcement system
said that was too long»

!:We don't think that victims of

discrimination should wait for two and one-half years to
receive a remedy»

We want a faster system»”

And that's why

they rejected the cease and desist system»
I would like to* if 1 may, reserve a few minutes
for rebuttal»
QUESTION:

Just one more that will call for a brief

answer»
Does this create problems for large employers in
terms of setting up reserves for contingent liabilities?
MR» VAUGHN:
QUESTION:

The present system?
No, if the Government's position is

19
correct* that it is open —
M.R0 VAUGHN;

Yes* the present system»

The Government

Yes* Mr* Chief Justice* the potential contingent
liability can be absolutely staggering and often one

Mr» Martin»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS 3» MARTIN* ESQ»*
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR* MARTIN;

Mr» Chief Justice* and may.it please

the Court:
In 1972* Congress authorized the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission to enforce Title 7 in. court* and
abandoned dependence upon private enforcement that was uni­
versally deemed to be totally ineffective»
Section 706* which is the focus of this litigation*
was designed to put the Government's enforcement muscle behind
Title 7»
Now* the issue in this case is whether Congress
intended that that enforcement muscle disappear after 180
days after the filing of the claim* or in the alternative*
terminate according to the \raried mandates of state statutes
of limitations

20
Before I go to the merits, I'd like to briefly
expand upon the factual context In which this delay claim
a ris es .
QUESTION:

Mr* Martin, is there one other alternative,

that Congress never even thought about the limitations question
and Government action?

Is there any evidence in legislative

history they thought about this problem?
MR» MARTIN:

I think there is evidence in the

legislative history that ohey did not intend to have a short
state statute or l80~day limitation*
I think,.

to put It very briefly, and I will get

back to it at further length «** Congress knew when it imposed
upon the EEOC the requirement to investigate, to conciliate
and to resolve as many of these problems by conciliation as
it could.
Congress knew that that process took 18 to 24 months,
and yet Congress required that as a prerequisite before you.
bring a Commission suit under
QUESTION:

»

That's a pretty effective argument to the

effect that Congress wasn't very happy about that, though*
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR* MARTIN:

Congress was unhappy »»
They certainly didn't want it to continue*
That's correct.

It was unhappy about

it, but it did not cut it off.
If I could go just a bit farther, X think I can

21
address your concern, as I develop it0
QUESTION:

Mr. Martin, do you have any knowledge of

figures as to hovi many cases filed with the Commission are
settled by conciliation as contrasted with those that are not?
MR. MARTIN:

I do, but I'd like to briefly indicate

now what the Commission has done in this area*
First, let me talk about this case, then what the
Commission does generally In response to your questions
When this case was brought, the San Francisco office
of the EEOC had fewer investigators than there are members of
this Court,

It had a thousand discrimination claims before it.

Nevertheless, they got to this claim within six months.
vestigation was completed within a year.

Within four months

later, conciliation was begun with the Petitioner
case.

In­

in this

Conciliation went on for another six months, and then

it was ended.

And then, at Petitioner's request, coneillation

was begun again for an additional five months.
QUESTION:

MR. MARTIN:

What Is conciliation?
Conciliation is after the Commission has

found out what the facts of the problem and the scope of the
discrimination which occurs in «*» allegedly occurs in the
particular industry,

they sit down with the individual

respondent in an attempt to work out an agreement,

either for

back pay, possibly, or for an end to the particular discrimin­
atory practice

22
The whole purpose of the '72 amendment and the '64
Act, really, was to try to resolve as many of these claims
through conciliation as possible»
QUESTION:

And conciliation, typically, could go on

for six months.
MR» MARTIN:

Conciliation could.

You can imagine

a situation where you have a company, like AT&T, a massive
company, thousands of people involved, hundreds of job cate­
gories, wages, transfer rights, unions involved.
very difficult process.

It Is a

It may involve difficult legal issues,

and everyone wants to go back and analyze those legal issues.
So, as long as conciliation is worthwhile, the
Commission has to follow it up.

The statute says it can only

bring suit when conciliation has failed.
sional prerequisite to suit.

That's the congres­

The Commission has no choice.

It can't end the business on the 179th day and sue, because
Congress has required it resolve these matters through con­
ciliation where possible.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

And that's what it is about.

Anything other than jawboning?
Nell, let's talk about results, I think,

and get to Mr. Justice Blackman's question.
Five thousand claims last year were resolved fchrougSi
conciliation.
Now, there were 80,000 »- Pardon me.

There were

over 40,000 discrimination claims resolved last year by the

23
EEOC, and that's with 2,500 full-time employees»

Five thousand

resolved through conciliatione
The percentage of claims over three years old was
reduced from 20$ to 5$»
So that, my point, I guess, is that when you have a
delay it is a shared responsibility»

It is not just the EEOC»

It arises out of the nature of the work, the conciliation
process, the magnitude of the discrimination problem in this
country, and the limitations on the EEOC's resources»
QUESTION;

Well, you don't say that with an ordinary

statute of limitations»

If the statute of limitations requires

the Government to indict somebody within four years or bring a
civil action within four years, you don't say to the defendant
it is a shared responsibility»

We've both got to get this

case to trial*
MR* MARTIN;

No, but when —

But I do say that if

the situation is such that Congress has required conciliation
and conciliation is a two-party business.

In other words,

respondents can encourage you to continue it and say It is still
worthwhile and the Commission has to continue it»

Congress

must have set up a system that reflects this reality*
What I am saying is if you look at the scope of the
problem and resources available, you get some reflection of
what Congress must have intended.
Sure, Mr* Justice Rehnquist, if there was a clear

24
statute of limitations;, there would be no defense to say it's
partly the respondent's fault that vie haven't met it*

But,

what vie are suggesting is that there is no clear statute of
interpretations — statute of limitations

and one should

not be implied „
I'd like to turn to the merits of the case, and
particularly to the language of Section 706(f)(1), which
reads ~~ I think it is important to know what the language
says.

It says, "If within 180 days from the filing of such

charge, the Commission has not filed a civil action, the
Commissioner shall so notify the person agreed,"
QUESTION:

Can I stop you right there and ask what

the Commission's view is as to whether that imposes any time
limitation within which the Commission has a duty to notify
the charging party?
MR* MARTIN:

The interpretation of that language,.

from our point of view, is that it imposes — It does two
things.

It sets out a time within which the Commission can

conciliate with the respondent, without interference from
private suit,

A private party can't sue before 180 days.

And it sets a time after which private party can demand and
*

must receive from the Commission a right to sue letter.
QUESTION:

It says the Commission shall so notify.

That seems to impose a duty upon the Commission, with or
without any request

25
MR. MARTIN:

That's right„

The language does appear

to do that, but the courts that have interpreted it -» Courts
of Appeals — have unanimously come to the conclusion that
it couldn't possibly mean that*

For this reason:

The 5?2

Act was meant to set up a process where you would have ■=»
resolve these claims through conciliation, if possible*
throughout*

That's

And, if there has to be a suit, it ought to be a

Commission suit, rather than a private suit.
Novi, if you interpret this as a mechanical limitation,
then 180 days after you have filed the claim, before the
Commission has even probably gotten to this particular claim,
the private party is going to have to sue or else his time
will run.

And, therefore, he sues without either the thing

being resolved through conciliation or without knowing that
the Commission might have brought suit if he had waited.
So it twists around the whole statute and funda­
mentally upsets or frustrates the congressional purpose.
QUESTION:

So, in other words, as I understand your

answer-"— and this reflects an earlier question by my Brother
Stevens

— your position is, first of a.ll, that there is no

time limitation within which the notice to sue must foe given
and, secondly, that there is no duty upon the Commission in
the absence of a request to ever give a notice to sue.
that right?
MR. MARTIN:

That's not precisely correct.

Is

26

When the Commission has decided that it cannot
conciliate and will not sue, itself* in other words, fulfilled
the congressional prerequisites, then the-Commission must

MR» MARTIN:

With or without request?
With or without request.

Apart from that, it only notifies upon request.
QUESTION:

If it decides that It is going to need seven

years, it doesn't have to notify until the expiration of

That's your answer to Justice Stewart's question.

If it takes a long time to make that decision,,: it
could go on for three years, it could go on -QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

That's correct.. It could go on for —
%

Now, let's-look -= i think it is well to talk about
how the courts can respond to that problem aside from a
statute of limitations, and X think there are two ways.
First, is in terms of the remedy.

If it is a truly

stale claim,an injunctive remedy will not be appropriate.
If it is a -»-*• talk about back pa;y which has been a
consideration here.

In Albemarle, this Court said --

27

QUESTION:
MRo MARTIN:

Two year limitation,,
Prior to claim being filed*

But in Albemarle., this Court said that If a cause of
action was prosecuted in such a fashion as to cause prejudice
to the opposing party, back pay could be denied altogether*
And in EEOC v, General Electric, which is at
532 P„2d 359* the Fourth Circuit said that in a situation
where a Commission suit has expanded the claim beyond what thei
charging party originally brought, back pay could be limited.,
liofc denied altogether, but limited.
So, there are equitable ways, in terms of Title 7(s
remedy, to deal with this problem*
QUESTION:

Take a situation where —

QUESTION:

aren'fc they?
MR, MARTIN:

I don't think they are, Justice

The point of the whole '72 Amendment is that he

suit.

The Commission brings the

And so —
QUESTION:

Well, you seem, to argue all the way

through that it is so much better for the EEOC to bring suit,
rather than the employee*
MR, MARTIN:

Why?

I am not arguing that It is better from

*»«» that this Court should think it's better, or that I think
It's better*

I am arguing that Congress thought it's better*

28
And the reason is, as they set out in the legislative history*
that the costs of brining suit, from their point of view*
were so great that valid Title 7 dawns — Let me quote its
"The costs involved effectively preclude a very large pereen~
tage of valid Title 7 claims from ever being litigated."
That's quoted in our brief at 26.

And what the

Congress is saying is that it is better for the Commission to
bring suit because private parties won't bring suit0

They

don't have the money»
You do get counsel fees.

You had counsel fees in

the '64 Act;» and yet Congress made a factual determination in
'72 that was insufficient.

That was Congress' judgment.

Let me give you some reasons why they were probably
right.

Attorneys' fees* first of all, are only discretionary,

only if you win.
take years„
fees.

It's only at the end of a process which may

The costs in a Title 7 suit are not just attorneys'

There are expert witnesses, computer time, experts on

management, testing, investigators„

It is a difficult and

complex process to bring a Title 7 suit.
Congress said let's take this burden off the
private party because it is not working and put that burden
on the Government.

First, giving them —

QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Why didn't they take it off completely?
They wanted to give, as the report of

the conference committee suggests rather clearly

Congress

29
realized that the process may take eighteen to twenty~four
months and* therefore* they said if a private party wants to
get out* wants to escape the administrative quagmire* as the
House report says* it ought to have the option to do so*

And

they gave that party the option after 180 days*
Any charging party* before the Commission* after

180 days, car. just come to the Commission and say* "I want to
get out of this*

I want to sue* myself*"

But for the great

bulk of them that's too expensive a proposition* or at least
thatfs what Congress determined.
It seems to us the statute has to be interpreted in
view of what Congress intended* what their view of the problem
was* whether we agree with it or not at this point.
QUESTION:

Mr. Martin* do you give the company any

possibility of relief from a stale claim?
MR. MARTIN:

30

QUESTION:

Is there any way at all that a company

could come In and have the case dismissed?
MR * MARTIN:

Yes„

Under 5 U*S0C0i, Section 706, the

courts of appeals have held in the Fifth Circuit, and I cite
the Court to Exchange Security Bank,529 Fe 2d 12140

These

are cited also in the briefs of one of the amicus here, the
Texas brief„

The charging party can come in and show to the

court that there has been prejudice to him from the destruc­
tion of evidence as a result of delay, that the delay is a
result of EEOC inaction, lethargy, or, you know, just letting
the suit sit around, and the court can stop the suit*
So there Is a result that's similar to laches that
can be achieved under the APA,
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN:

That sounds like laches&
It's very much like laches, except Jit’s

under the A PA,
QUESTION:

Since you put that in terms of the

broad scope of the equity powers of a district judge, aren't
you opening the door to having 397 different approaches to that
problem by 397 different district judges?

The Court of Appeals

can't really lay down an effective set of guidelines,
MR. MARTIN:

Again, I refer the Court to those

opinions and the guidelines laid down are that you have to
have — it's in the nature of laches, that you have got to
show prejudice.

31
QUESTION:

It Is a guideline that doesn’t guide

very much.,
MR. MARTIN:

It is a difficult case.

We don't

expect that there will be that many cases.
Let me talk about the results of what would happen
if we followed the Petitioner’s proposal.
l8G~days statute of limitations means that the
96,000 claims that are going to be filed before the EEOC this
year, EEOC could get to very few of them, if any, depending or
the backlog situation. Thousands of pending claims.
First of all, there are over 100,000 pending claims
that would all be out in the courts.

The new claims, 90,000

a year, would be in the courts.
Does that make any sense, especially in the light
of Congress' determination that these things ought to be
resolved through conciliation.
It’s exactly v;hat Congress was trying to avoid.
And if you have a 180-day limitation, there is no other
result.
QUESTION:

What about the analogous statute of

limitations?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

State statute of limitations?
What about that as a fall-back position?
Well, the state statute of limitations,

first, as a legal matter ~~ The rule has always been, that state

32

statutes don't apply to the Federal Government in the absence
of some intent.
QUESTION:

Well, we've managed now for nearly —* for

over 20 years to function under the Federal Tort Claims Act,
using much more elusive standards of law, state law, than a
statute of limitations,
MR. MARTIN:

Oh, yes, but the Tort Claims Act

specifically requires the application of state law.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting -- I was merely

responding to your suggestion that it is not workable.
MR. MARTIN:

Okay.

On the policy point, it gives the Commission some»
what more time, but we have to understand the state statute
of limitations may run *»« maybe a year statute of limitations,
for example.
The Commission's cause of action may not accrue for
300 days after the injury has occurred, and what sense does it
make to apply a state statute of limitations when the Commission's cause of action doesn't accrue, because the
Commission can't sue until the claim has been filed, which in
seme cases may be 300 days after the injury occurred.

It

usually is 180, depending upon whether there is a state FEP
system.
Secondly, the Commission has to investigate and
conciliate and go through all those steps, and until it finishes

33
that process no cause of action accrues.
So you have a state time limitation running and yet
the Commission can't sue.
result.

That can hardly be a sensible

It just doesn't work, and, moreover, it's not

necessary.
If there is a real prejudice case —vancT this isn't.
Petitioner has never alleged he was prejudiced.

He obviously

shared the responsibility for the delays here, but if there
was one —

then the courts could take care of that on an

ad hoc basis through the APA or through the relief provisions,
I'd like to speak briefly to the two assumptions
that Petitioner made at the outset, that somehow the Congress
viewed the delay problem as resulting from EEOC ineptitude,
and Congress decided, well, let's put\ a stop to it by putting
I

in this 180-day provision.
There are two reasons why that's got to be wrong.
First, Congress viewed the delay problem as resulting from the
scope of the Commission's task and not from EEOC foot-dragging,
I refer the Court to Page 12 of the House Report
92238, for Congress

view that delay arises from "the

burgeoning workload, accompanied by insufficient funds and
a shortage of staff."
And the Senate Report 92415, at Page 4, described
the EEOCs efforts as heroic at that point.
Does that sound like Congress wants to put a 130-day

'34
limitation on them?

It just doesn't make sense.

Secondly, the language that they rely upon, the
notification provision, could not have been a response to the
delay problem because that language was in the '64 Act„
QUESTION:

Well, it is quite possible, isn't it, that

Congress could have thought the processing of these things
was taking too long, without in any way reflecting on the
performance of the individuals who were doing it»

Maybe the

Government just didn't have enough staff in the agency.
MR. MARTIN:

And then Congress had the choice to

eliminate the process altogether or greatly expand the staff
and put some reasonable time limitations, but Congress did
neither.
QUESTION:

Well, you suggest that Congress always

carefully works those things out.

You know, they have enlarged

a lot of causes of action in the courts without creating a
whole lot of new judgeships, too.
MR. MARTIN:

Sure.

Absolutely, but the opposite

assumption must be that Congress had a process that took 18
to 24 months and said, well, from now on, it is going to take
180 days and that is it.
That just can't work, as long as Congress wants to
resolve these things through conciliation and through Commission
suit and not private suit.

If that's the intent, and I think

if you read the legislative report that has to be the 5-ntent,

35
then there can't be such a short state statute of limitations,
QUESTION:

Out of every 100,000 claims that are

filed ■with the EEOC!, what percentage are, a) conciliated
successfully, or two, litigation is filed?
MR, MARTIN:

Well, 1 do have the claims on the

successful conciliation.

The 5,000 figure I gave you were

the successful conciliations out of 40,000 claims filed,
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN:

5,000 out of 40?
Successful,

And, in terms of litigation,

I do not have those figures.
But, once again, that's -QUESTION:

Well, you certainly didn't file suit

in the other 35,000.
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Absolutely not.
Even though there was no time limit —
Many of them were dismissed for lack

of evidence,
QUESTION:

Even though there was no time limit

whatsoever,
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
So, when you are talking about all these

cases being filed in the courts, you are only talking about
the cases that you think you have a successful

a pretty

good chance of conciliating, but you don't have time to do it,
so you file suit.

36
MR, MARTIN:

Well, what I am talking about is that

the private party — If the Commission is cut off after 180
days, the private party has no alternative but to go file
suit.
QUESTION:

He certainly has alternative.

He can

trust his chances and says, "I've got a lousey chance," and
doesn't file suit.
QUESTION:

And just forget it.

QUESTION:

You say that most private parties can't

afford to sue, anyway.
MR. MARTIN:

Well, what I am saying is that Congress;

determined that there xvere valid claims not being taken care
of because the costs were too great.

So, you are either going

to have the valid claim not being taken care of in contra­
vention of the '72 Amendment, or you are going to have these
people filing suit.

It's one or the other.

You know, some

people may drop out altogether.
QUESTION:
cases.

You mentioned 100,000 cases a year, new

Assuming just for the moment, that there were that

many meritorious claims, which is a large, large assumption,
how many hundreds of lawyers would it take to process those?
Any studies or any estimates on that at all?
MR. MARTIN:
enormous number,
your question.

To litigate them all?

It would be an

I don't know any studies, in response to

37
QUESTION:

In percentages, how many cases were

found to be lacking in merit or frivolous?
MR* MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

We simply don't have those figures.
A very large percentage, is it not?
I think a large percentage are found to

be lacking in evidence, and are not pursued.
But, isn't it better to have that found out through
a conciliation process by the Commission than before the
court?
QUESTION:

In volume, how many EEOC cases have been

filed by EEOC?
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR0 MARTIN:

Litigation?
Yes.
We do not have that figure.

If I can

come up with that figure, I will submit it to the Court and
to counsels.
QUESTION:

In terms of the number of claims filed,

I should think you would know, the Commission would know.
MR* MARTIN:

It certainly can be found out and we

will find out and submit it to the Court.

But, I guess what

we are suggesting is that what Congress -QUESTION:

This is pertinent to the argument you

have been making that if 180 days is the limitation, there
is going to be a flood more of EEOC cases.
MR. MARTIN:

No, no.

EEOC cannot file —

38
QUESTION:
MR„ MARTIN:

Oh, I see, you will turn them over to —
We can't file them, because we haven’t

fulfilled the statutory prerequisites»
QUESTION:

We haven't conciliated,

If' this all comes about, though, the

analogous statements of the statute of limitations, that
would take an enormous amount of pressure, this 180-day
pressure, that you speak of, off of the Commission; would it
not?

And it wouldn’t be any great research undertaking to

have someone make up a table of all the analogous statutes
of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, would it?
MR, MARTIN:

It would not take the pressur-e off

because the statute ~~ depends on when the statute runs.
If you are assuming the statute runs from the time of the
injury, okay,

— From the time of the discrimination, for

180 days and perhaps 300 days, it is not even filed with the
Commission.

And then the Commission still has to investigate

and conciliate before It can file suit.
The pressure will be exactly the same, Mr. Chief
Justice, unless the statute runs from a different time.
Let me note that the,Fifth Circuit, in cases
following Griffin Wheel,, they've held that the state statute
is told during the Commission proceeding -- the District
Courts following Griffin Wheel.
And in that situation, I refer to 4l6 F Sup. 1006.
It is the only District Court case following Griffin Wheel.

39
They told the state statute while the Commission is proceeding»
QUESTION:

Griffin-4'JelI is the one that took the

other position from this »MR» MARTIN: That's right»

He said the state statute

applied »
QUESTION:

Mr» Martin, do you agree with me that

our profession is one that only operates on deadlines, that
we never do anything ahead of time?
MR» MARTIN:

There are sometimes delays in the

leg&l profession, I will agree,
QUESTION:

Have you ever seen anybody file a brief

a day ahead of time, a lawyer?
MR, MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Very seldom, Mr, Justice —
Don't you think it would be good

in this statute to put a time limit on it?
MR» MARTIN:

A) It might be good in this statute,

but would have to be a time limit that is consistent with the
workload of the Commission, the difficulty of the problems
it has, and the process,

It would have to take into con­

sideration the days that the -- the fact that the charge may
be deferred to a state commission and they might never get io
until 300 days.
They have to take Into account that you have to
conciliate before you sue, and you take into account the
resources they have, the scope of the discrimination problem

in this country»

Put that all together and then set a

reasonable statute of limitations»
That might be good for Congress to do.

All I am

suggesting is Congress didn't do it.
QUESTION: Is there any other Federal Commission or
Agency that is authorized to bring suits against private
citizens without any statute of limitations whatever?

Infinity

actions?
MR. MARTIN:

The analogy that the Court of Appeals

drew was to the NLRB process* in which the court said that
no state statute of limitation applied.
I don't know whether there is a Federal statute
that applies there.

I presume not from the thrust of the

opinions.
Congress ~~ I think the way to approach the problem
Is that Congress gave the Commission a special role,,

It said

it was supposed to be the primary enforcer of Title 7«
This Court has numerous times said that Title 7 is
of the greatest importance in terms of a policy.

So* Congress

has determined* thirdly*that* as a factual matter* these suits
would not be brought and rights would not be vindicated but
for the Commission suit.,

It set up a process of conciliation,

and then litigation where necessary* and if litigation is
necessary that the Commission should bring it* and these
limitations would frustrate them

41

QUESTION:

Do you really think that Congress would

allow suit fifteen, twenty years afterwards?
MR, MARTIN:

I think Congress would expect, as

everyone here xuould expect, that the courts would say that
that suit is barred, that particular suito
QUESTION:

Barred by ivhat?

MR0 MARTIN: As I suggested,that the APA could be
used in a laches type concept to bar that particular suito
What I am suggesting is the individual, if there is
a prejudice claim, the courts can take care of that*
QUESTION:

Prejudice in the sense that interest

runs on claims for back pay, and on the uncertainty as to
whether positions can or cannot be filled by other individuals,
There is always prejudice,
MR, MARTIN:

<

If there is a showing of prejudice,,

the District Court can respond by limiting back pay to

'

back pay altogether, only granting Injunction or not granting
an injunction.
We are equipped to respond in a particular case,
but but if we propose a state statute of limitations, thousands
of cases which Congress determined ought to have been con­
sidered, conciliated and possibly sued upon by the Commission,
will not be.
QUESTION:
MR, MARTIN:

Has there been prejudice in this case?
I think not.

There has been no showing

42

of any.

There has been no claim of any.
If Petitioner sits down and asks the Commission,

"Well, let's continue to conciliate a bit longer.

X think we

can get this resolved," and the Commission says, "Yes, we will
conciliate a bit longer," and they spend another six months.
I wouldn't call that prejudice.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

What is left of this case?
This case does, in response to a

question raised earlier, raise a continuing claim.

On page

10 of the Appendix, there's reference to the complaint which
is a continuing claim of Title 7 discrimination.
This case would go on, regardless.
QUESTION:

Mr, Martin, may I ask you a question

about the statutory language*

"Shall so notify the person

aggrieved" and so forth, the mandatory language.

Is it

possible to read that section to say that if the conditions
preceding that, namely, that 180 days have gone by and there
has been no conciliation, and so forth..,

Then

1 •

the Commission has a mandatory duty to notify the private
plaintiff who may then bring suit within 90 days, but that
doesn't put any limit on the Commission’s right to bring
subsequent suit.

Would that be a possible construction?

MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

That would be a possible construction.
It seems to be all it says.
. And then the Commission could sue.

^3
QUESTION:
it that way.

But the Commission doesn’t so interpret

They don't think they have any raandatory duty

at all, do they?
MR» MARTIN:

Of course, that question isn’t in the

suit, but the Commission doesn't want the private party's
right to run before the Commission has decided whether or not
it will sue.
QUESTION:

Maybe that’s what Congress ordered it

to do,
MR. MARTIN:

Well, the legislative history, as far

as we can determine, is the other way.
Let me refer you, Justice Stevens, to Tuft y.
McDonnell, 53-7 F. 2d 1301»
«

That’s an Eighth Circuit case

which analyzes this particular section and the notice
provisions and the notice requirements,

I think it will be

helpful in that regard, but legislative history simply won't
support that analysis.
If there are no further questions, I thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Vaughn?

Do you have anything

You have a few minutes,

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS H» VAUGHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, VAUGHN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

Just really three or four points.
On this point of claim of prejudice, the Assistant

44
Solicitor General takes.the position that there is no prejudice
here to Petitioner* that we have never claimed prejudice*
It is the nature of a statute of limitations defense* of
course* that prejudice is assumed, need not be proven*
We did not raise the issue of laches in our motion
for summary judgment for the simple reason that laches is
virtually impossible to prove by way of summary judgment
because it is factually oriented and there will be substantial
differences with respect to material fact*

Therefore* Laches

has never been a part of this case* any time from the begin­
ning* but I think there is no obligation upon us to prove
p^rejudice in order to prevail in this manner*
I think that Mr. Justice Marshall in a very real
sense put his finger right on it when he referred to the
propensity of lawyers to put off until tomorrow what they
could do and should do toe ay*
Now* I don't think we lawyers are the only ones
guilty of that*

Parkinson's Law* I believe, was something to

the effect that work expands so as to fill the time available
for its completion*
And if one is not given a deadline to comply with*
one is going to put off that project until tomorrow* and
tomorrow and tomorrow.

And that is exactly what is happening

here *
The Solicitor General says that there are 90*000 new

45
cases every year and we, the EEOC, won't be able to do anything
with them, so we'll have to march them right into court.
Well, they are assuming the negative.
assuming they won't, or can't, do anything.
the matter is they can do something.
those charges.

They are

But the fact of

They can investigate

They can conciliate those charges. They can

make judgments about which ones to take to court, and they
can make judgments about which ones may be taken to court just
as well by the individual private parties.
After all the National Labor Relations Board, with an
influx of cases, roughly half of that 90,000 figure, about
45,000 a year, has a median time from charge to completion of
investigation of 43 days.
QUESTION:
MR, VAUGHN:

How big is their staff, if you know?
I think their staff is somewhat smaller

than that of the EEOC, but I can't give any reliable figures,
You know, one reason, Mr„ Chief Justice, that they
have a median time of 43 days is because they have a time
limit internally imposed upon themselves at 45 days.
QUESTION:

But they are not obligated to conciliate

the way the EEOC Is?
MR, VAUGHN:
obligation.

They don't ha?e a statutorily "mandated

They do, however, come to a charge party,

Mr. Justice Rehnqu1st, and they say, "We are going to file
a complaint two days from now unless you reinstate these

46
employees and give them back pay.
Well, that's a form of conciliation.
)

You

decide right away what you are going to do, and you have two
days in which to do it, and if you don't reinstate with
back pay, in comes the complaint.
I see my time is up.
Thank you.
