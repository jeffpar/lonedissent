,MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
in Santa Fe Industries against Green.

We will resume arguments
Mr. Glendon, you may

pick up where you left off yesterday.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. GLENDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
[Resuming]
MR. GLENDON:

I would like to reserve three minutes

for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I think as we suspended yesterday I was referring
to Judge Moore’s dissent in saying that to say that the
circumstances here presented a scenario of fraud was a patent
distortion of the term.

To put the facts into a little sharper

focus, I would like to refer to a couple of matters.

Judge

Medina in the majority opinion, in approaching the subject
involved, made reference to schemes of wile and ^cunning and
so sophisticated as to almost defy belief.

In fact, as Judge

Moore noted, the circumstances here were.such that he found they
were matters of utmost simplicity and patent reasonableness.
In the concurring opinion, Judge Mansfield inveighed
against the idea of companies going public when the market is
flourishing and then going private when the market is depressed.
In fact, as the record shows her®, Kirby has always been a
public company.

The price that was paid for the stock—offered

10

for the stock—was much higher than anything shown in the
record before.

We do not know what the plaintiffs' basis here

for the stock was, but it is interesting to note—I think it
is at page 102 of the joint appendix—that he pleads and
complains of the fact that he is going to have to pay a
capital gains tax on this transaction, which

is certainly a

most unusual complaint of a victim of a claimed fraud.
Q

Of course his claim was addressed to the fact

that he did not have any option about the source.
MR. GLENDON:

He has another option, of course, of

getting a fair evaluation.

And the Delaware statute, as I

pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, specifically provides and is
part of his contract and the charter of the corporation that
minority stockholders can be eliminated from the corporation.
I think the first principle that we should consider
here is the fact, that the Securities Acts, the '33 and '34
acts, are disclosure statutes.

This Court said in the

Affiliated Ote case that the philosophy was to substitute a
philosophy of full disclosure for that of caveat emptor.

We

think the court below ignored that as well as ignored their
own holding in the Popkin case only two years before when
they said the function of the statute is primarily to
disclose and inform rather than becoming enmeshed in passing
judgments on the information disclosed.
They ignored too, we feel, the language of the

11
statute itself, which, as this Court said in the Ernst £ Ernst
case, speaks so specifically of manipulation and deceit.

And

we find no reference in the Court’s decision, the majority
decision, to the statute itself.

And we think that of course

ws must begin there with the statute.
The language prohibits manipulative and deceptive
devices and contrivance, in contravention of the rules of th©
commission.

And to us it is clear that they are talking about

deceit and deception.

The Court of Appeals met this problem

not by taking it on headlong but simply eliminating deception
and deceit from the statute even though, as I said, they had
just previously stated a couple of years before that the
disclosure was a key purpose of the statute.
Hi® plaintiff ‘tries t© avoid this problem by a
variety of references to other cases, other statutes, relying
principally, it seems to us, upon arguments in cases which
invoke matters of constructive fraud.
disclosure statute.

But the statute is a

It did not—I repeat, did not—try to

take on all the wrongs of the world.

The Congress adopted a

philosophy of disclosure, and it said that when you disclose,
you cannot make deceitful disclosures, deceptive disclosures.
And that, we feel, is the problem before the Court today.
Th® cases that this Court has considered on the
matter we think support that.

The plaintiffs seem to get

support from the Bankers Life case, but that was a clear case

12
where this Court said the statute should be read flexibly, and
we certainly agree with that.
a deception case.

But the Bankers Life case was

It was a clear case of deception.

The

Court referred there to the fact that misrepresentations had
been made, that the board of directors had been duped.

So,

that case really offers no help, in our view, to the plaintiffs
The Court too has said that the statute will not be
read narrowly and has removed artificial barriers to the
administration of the statute.
it said just that.

For example, in Bankers Life

And it broadened some of the categories

in terms of reliance and such.

But it has not and it has

never—and I do not believe it should or could remove th©
concept of deceit from the statute because, if you do, if
that is done, then you do not have a statute that involves
deception.

And it seems to us it is as simple as that.
There may be wrongs that people can lay claims to.

w® do not think so in this case.
interest.

There may be conflicts of

There may be fiduciary breaches.

actions ©f waste.

There may be

But they are not actions for deceit.

And

the statute says deceit.
Q

Mr. Glendon, what if majority shareholders

moving under the Delaware short-form merger statute did
engage in deceptive conduct, say, in discussing valuation with
th© minority shareholders.

Would the minority shareholders

then have a 10b-5 action for damages?

13
MR. GLENDON:

If they engaged in deception in the

disclosure, yes, Mr. Justice Relinquish, I think they would.
And the Popkin case made clear that 10b-5 in a short-form
merger is not a nugatory thing because the splinter shareholder has an investment decision to make.

He can either

accept the offer, or he can take his appraisal remedy under
the Delaware statute.
I think perhaps th® fallacy in the plaintiffs'
approach and in the majority's decision is simply that they
believe that every wrong or possible wrong or conceivable
wrong that, may arise in connection with securities should be
cured by th© application of 10b~5.

I will discuss later

what, that may do to the federal courts,,

But quit© apart from

the result of such a thing, the fact simply is, w@ feel, that
fch® Congress never intended that and, starting as we must,
with th© clear language of th© statute, it just seems there is
no basis for doing it.
It is not—and Judge Medina in his majority opinion
recognised this--10b-5 is not a panacea for all wrongdoing.
It: has a limited purpose which should be construed broadly,
of course.

But it has a limited purpose of requiring

disclosure and having an informed investor.
The court below, passing fraud, moved into the area
of fiduciary breach, ssjd it engrafted upon 10b-5 not fraud
but said that there was a fiduciary breach here.

We do not

14

think that fiduciary breach and fraud are the same thing.
may be deception in a fiduciary breach.

There

But whether there is

overreaching or conflict of interest or other aspects of
fiduciary breach, they do not come under 10b-5„

We think it

is difficult to understand how the court did that, to
engraft a fiduciary breach onto it, but it is almost
impossible to explain what the breach was here.

And I would

like to go into that just briefly.
The court said that the allegation of gross under­
valuation alone was not enough.
breach.

That was not a fiduciary

But what it said was that undervaluation, combined

with a lack of express corporate purpose other than the
obvious advantages that may come to a company from going
private, but the court said that in the absence of other
express corporate purpose, in the

absence of prior notices,

although as I think I said yesterday, the Delaware statute
requires post-merger, not prior notice.
The court said that the combination of those three
things constituted a broach of fiduciary
breach resulted in the violation of 10b-5.

duty, and that
It was a scheme

and contrivance und artifice to defraud.
That, we think, is a startling proposition.

It has

the obvious vice of rewriting the Delaware statute because the
court had to rewrite the Delaware statute in order to cone to
that result.

The Delaware courts have said that the very

15
purpose of 10b-5 is to permit the elimination of the splinter
shareholders.

And I may say that some 30 other states have

the same or similar provisions where minority shareholders
can be eliminated.
So, to engraft on that a requirement of corporate
purpose nullifies in effect the Delaware statute.
Secondly, to engraft on or amend the statute which
now says you must give notice within ten days after the
merger, to say you must give notice before the merger, again
rewrites the Delaware statute.

Judge Moors said something to

the effect that the court, while it was engrafting changes on
corporate charters, was also putting the torch to Erie v.
Tompkins.

And I think that is a fair statement of fact.

The court simply rewrote the Delaware law.
In terms of corporate purpose, it seems to us that
apart from changing the statute, not supplementing state law
but supplanting state law, in doing that—
y
second?

Mr. Glendon, could I interrupt for just a

I do not quite understand the significance of your

argument on rewriting the Delaware statute.

If, for example,

the Delaware statute said that certain information shall not
b© disclosed and it required that there be a non-disclosure,
and ' rule 10b-5 would require a disclosure, would not rule
10b-5 prevail?
MR. GLENDON:

That would b© in the area of disclosure,

16
and fehat is what the statute is about;, Mr. Justice Stevens.
The statute requires disclosure.

It is not, however, a

statute-Q

But in the event there is a conflict between

the Delaware statute and the requirements of Buie 10b-5,
Rule 10b-5 would apply, would it not?
MR. GLENDON:

But we are saying to you here, sir,

that there cannot be that conflict under this aspect of the
case.

This is not a disclosure requirement.

It is a regula­

tion.

It is a regulation of Delaware corporations who are

chartered by the State of Delaware and set up and governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware.

And the State of Delaware

says that you may eliminate a minority shareholder, and they
have a statute.

The Supreme Court of Delaware has said that

the very purpose of that statute is to b® able to eliminate.
That is what it is about.
What the court has done here is said „ "You have got
to have another purpose.”

This is not disclosure.

under the disclosure statute.

This is not

This is regulating a Delaware

Corporation contrary to what the Delaware law says.
Q

But is not. your basic proposition that there is

simply no violation of Rul® 10b-5?
MR. GLENDON:
Q

Yes.

And if that is true, why then it does not

matter whether a violation would require a revision of the

17
Delaware statute or not»
MR» GLENDON:

What we are saying simply is that to

get to the result that it got, the court had to rewrite the
statute.

And to do that, to take a federal statute and apply

it so that you have got to rewrite a state statute, in the
absence of a clear intent by the Congress that they are to
do that, an express intent that if Congress had said, "Here
you may regulate" and they pass a federal corporation law
and say, "Everything that is unfair from now on in corporate
matters will be' governed by federal law"—they have not done
that.

They have said simply one thing.

there shall be disclosure.

They have said that

I am trying to point out that

when they say not only disclosure but when they say you have
to have an express different corporate purpose, they are
telling Delaware how to run its corporation and amending, we
say, the statute.
They amend it in another way too, and that is on the
fact of notice.

I think I nointed that out.

This is interest­

ing, 1 think, because that requirement is a useless require­
ment really.

They have said that there must be prior notice,

but Delaware has said that you can eliminate the shareholders,
and they have set tip the statutory procedure in that fashion.
There is no pre-merger going into court.

The Delaware Court

has said, as a matter of fact—-the Supreme Court has said
that it would be difficult to assume any situation where there

18

could be such actual fraud as to set aside a merger because
the whole purpose of the statute is to do that.
Q

What if Delaware had said you may not eliminate

minority stockholders in this manner.

Your client had come

along and given notice to these shareholders and said, "We
know it is a violation of Delaware law, and this is what the
Delaware law says, and this is what we are going to do.

I do not think that would be a 10b-5

I do not think it would be because of this disclosure,

not, Mr. Chief Justice.

what the majority have done in this case.
Your Honor, I think at this point I would reserve
the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Glandon.

Mr. Bender.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY BENDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BENDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it nlease

the Court:
This case? first arose because of the fact that the
defendants made a motion to dismiss so that all the allegations
and the fair inferences from the facts stated in the amended
complaint are deemed to be true for purposes of this particular
appeal.
Ernst & Ernst stated that the 1933 act was to
protect investors against fraud and to promote ethical
standards of honesty and fair dealing.

And certainly the same

20
stricture applies to the '34 act.

The '34 act uses the term

manipulative or deceptive device in contravention of the rules
to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and the SEC did promulgate 10b-5.
covers fraud.

10b~5 clearly on its face

And this Court in Ernst & Ernst when it was

talking about 10b and 10h--5 used the term deception, manipula­
tion or fraud.

Deception and fraud are synonymous.

When a

person deceives, he may deceive by non-disclosure in a non­
verbal way, or he may be deceived by affirmative misrepre­
sentation.

Clauses one and three of lflb-5, as held by this

Court in Superintendent of Insurance, stated -that misappropria­
tion is a garden variety type of fraud.

The most important

part about the deceit and fraud in Superintendent of
Ins\iranc® was th© fact the majority stockholder used the funds
of the corporation to purchase the controlling interest.
But the defendants do not quarrel with the Schoenbaum
case, which has been decided in the Second Circuit.

And what

majority stockholder—
Q

Mr. Bender, you &r© going to point out where

the fraud lies here?
MR. BENDER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Should I get to that

right now?
Q

You ware leading up to it, and I would like to

have you pin it down.

21
MR. BENDER;

The fraud here, Your Honor, is that

an appraisal was made in February of 1974 by Santa Fe of the
timberlands of Kirby Lumber Company.

That showed a fair

market value for those timberlands ©f $320 million.
book value was $9 million.

The

So that means that Santa Fe knew

that the true worth of the assets, the ohysical assets, of
Kirby was equivalent to $772 per share, and that has to be
an assumed fact that has been alleged, and it is accepted as
a fact for purposes of this appeal.
Q

No stock has ever moved at that figure, has it?

MR. BENDER:

No, it has not because it was never a

disclosure to the stockholders that the timberlands were
worth $320 million.
Q

And you will explain the non-satisfactory

character of the state remedy?
MR. BENDER:

Yes, I will, but I want to first get

into the fraud, as Your Honor first addressed yourself to.
With a physical value of $320 million and a book
value of $9 million, fair market value means that Kirby could
go out, obtain a willing buyer, and sell those timberlands for
$320 million.

So, for ©ur purposes and for valuation

purposes, that is cash in the bank.

So that the physical

assets must be deemed to be the equivalent of $772 cash in the
bank.
They retained the prestigious firm of Morgan Stanley

22

& Company to come in and appraise the worth of the shares.
They appraised it at $125 a share.

That was in June of ’74.

In July of c74 they created a dummy corporation, Forest
Products, Inc., solely for the purpose—and it is stated in
the information statement which went out after the merger
took place—solely for the purpose of increasing their
percentage of ownership from 95 percent to 100 percent of that
corporation, which meant eliminate the minority.
Then in the end of July the merger effectively took
place between FPI corporation and Kirby.

There was no

reason given on July 30, 1974 as to why they decided $150 was
fair.

They only had the Morgan Stanley appraisal which showed

a fair value, according to Morgan, at $120.

But Morgan had

in its possession of Appraisal Associates, which showed that
tli® breakup value of these physical assets was $320 million
just for the timberlands.
Q

Mr. Bender, would I be defrauding you if I

offered to sail you stock at $150 a share and it the same time
said, "Her® is an appraisal which says the stock, if you
liquidate it and were able to sell all of the assets, would

23
be worth $720 a share"?
MR. BENDER:

You would b© defrauding me, Mr. Justice

Powell, if you had in your power 95 percent of the stock,
which meant that you could force me to accept $150 a share
and, if I refused, despite my refusal you voted in such a way
that I had to accept that $150 a share.

And ‘the mere fact

that you disclosed to me beforehand the fact that the true
value was $720 a share would still amount to a fraud because
you were breaching your fiduciary obligation to me because you
would be in effect forcing me to accept by reason of your 9-5
percent control"“£orcing me to accept the transaction.

And,

in addition to that, you would deliberately undervalue the
shares at $150 a share when you knew the true worth was $772
a shar© or $720.
Q

But you have omitted one vary important fact

in this situation, and that is that nobody has forced your
client to take $150 a share.
MR. BENDER:
Q

They certainly have, Your Honor.

Wait just one minute.

Let me finish the

question.
MR. BENDER:
Q

I am sorry.

You have the right, if you think that is an

unfair price, to pursue your appraisal remedy, of course.
MR. BENDER:
way, Your Honor.

Lot me first answer that in a two-pronged

First of all, on the date that my clients

24
wore required to accept $150 a share, they did not even know
they sold their shares at $150«

So, there was no disclosure.

This is a complete myth that there was disclosure before the
fraud took place,

when they purchased the shares of the

minority on July 31, 1974, there was no disclosure.

They had

within their own possession the knowledge that they had an
appraisal which showed the true worth was $770 a share, and
it is no different from a majority stockholder who knows that
oil has been discovered, like in the Schoenbaum case, gees
to the corporation and says, "Gentlemen, I would like to buy
your treasury shares because I am the controlling stockholder,
at the prevailing market price,” when no disclosure has been
mad© to the public so that the prevailing market price does
not reflect the fact that a major oil discovery has been made.
In Schoenbaum Judge Hays, in the Second Circuit,
said a clearer case of fraud could not be set forth because the
majority controlling influence used his shares to force the
corporation to sell him shares at a totally inadequate price-Q

May I ask this question?

MR. BENDER:

—which was a fraud on the corporation

and a fraud on the minority stockholders.
Q

You talk so fast you do not give me an opportunity

t© ask any questions.
MR. BENDER:

I am sorry, Your Honor, but I do have

a limited time.
Q

I understand that, and I will not try to

25
interrupt: you too frequently.

The District Court found there

was no misstatement of immaterial fact or omission of a
material fact.

The Court of Appeals accepted that.

You are

arguing, as I understand, that both those courts were wrong
in those respects.
MR. BENDER:
Appeals was wrong.

No, I am not arguing that the Court of

The Court of Appeals said and Judge

Mansfield said that disclosure after the consummation of the
merger is virtually equivalent to no disclosure at all.
that is certainly true.

And

It is like the president of a

corporation, dealing with securities of that corporation, were
to abscond to Florida with $15 million of securities while
the corporation was selling securities.

After he gets to

Florida, the next day he sends a wire to the corporation and
says, "Gentlemen, I have absconded with your securities, and
here I am in Florida."
Now, because of that confession—
Q

Just a minute, Mr. Bender.

MR. BENDER:
Q

Excuse me.

Slow down and start answering some questions,

will you?
MR. BENDER
Q

%

X am sorry.

Supposing he absconds but before he absconds,

he tells the corporation, "I am going to abscond to Florida
tomorrow morning, and I am going to take $15 million worth of

26

securities that do not belong to ms with me."

Has he

defrauded anybody?
MR. BENDER:

Of course he has because the mere fact

of disclosure does not mean that—if he has in his control the
ability to still steal those securities, disclosure does not
cure a fraud.

If I have the possession—-to consummate the

transaction because of the fact that I have 95 percent of the
stock in my possession and I tell the minority, even in a
full disclosure case beforehand, which did not happen here,
if I tell the minority beforehand, "Gentlemen, your stock is
worth. $770 per share but yet I am going to pay you, because
I am the majority stockholder, $150 a share.

And if you do

not like it, you can seek an appraisal in state court."
Now, that has two vices.

The majority stockholder

is breaching his fiduciary obligation, number one, because of
the fact that he has the ability, because of his 95 percent
ownership, to fore© the transaction on the minority, even if
they say, "No, w© are not going to accept it."

Because of the

fact that he is a 95 percent shareholder, he can force them to
take that $150 or seek an appraisal.

And I will get to the

question of whether or not that is an adequate remedy.
And why is it. a fraud?

Because he knows that the

true worth of those shares is $772 per share and yet despite
that, he has fixed as a. fair value only $150 a share.
Q

Mr. Bender, do you see--

MR. BENDER:

Mr. Bender, what is the difference between

Mr. Bender, you place a great deal of emphasis

on what you call the true worth.

it as a fair value and a fair market value.

asked you right now, "What is the fair market value of, say,
IBM or AT&T or any other stock that is traded actively?"

than any company in the world.

MR. BENDER:

In that kind of case, yes, that would

be true right now.
Q

Let me finish my question.

MR. BENDER:
Q

I ain sorry.

Are you suggesting that the fair market value

of stock always is equivalent to the net asset value per share?
MR. BENDER:
Q

Not always.

Well, the net asset value?

Yes.

the majority stockholder is going to capture the underlying
values, yes, if that was higher than a capitalization of

MR. BENDER;

We would not, not under Delaware law.

Delaware law provides, number one, that they will not
consider anything except historical earnings.

It does not:

Mr. Bender, could I ask you a question?

MR. BENDER:
Q

Yes,

The appraisal dated February 19, 1974 contains

That is, in

effect, an admission by your adversary that that is the fair
market value of the tangible assets.
MR. BENDER:

That is correct.

Would that be admissible in evidence in the

appraisal proceeding?

MR. BENDER:

I sure did have it in my possession.

That was the reason that we alleged that the true value of
the assets was $772 per share.
Q

And so all of the information on which you

relied for your allegation of $772 per share is available in
that appraisal in form which would b@ admissible in the
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware court?
MR. BENDER:

In this particular case, yes.

In fact,

the value of those timberlands may even be greater, than $320
million.

I have been in many proceedings where experts have

been retained, sir, and with all due deference to experts,
when they have bean retained by a particular party to give
appraisals, that many, many times we found that even though
the appraisal is substantially more than what appears on the
books, that nonetheless that that is even an understatement
of the true worth.
Q

You have alleged that the appraisal was an

undervaluation.
MR. BENDER:
Q
conservative.

Pardon me?

You have alleged that the appraisal was too

31
HR. BENDER:

We have alleged that the value of the

shares was at least $772, and this matter has proceeded to
this point without any discovery or inspection by us of books
and records of Santa F@.

This was strictly a pleading matter,

and the pleading was dismissed on the face of it.

And all

the allegations in the pleading are deemed to be correct.
But sine® the defendants were stuck with that $772 because of
the fact that after the fraud was consummated they disclosed
i

that fact to the stockholders, then we come to the situation,,
well, sure we have it to allege in our complaint—
Q

Is it not correct, just so I have the sequence

right, that after th© February appraisal of tangible assets
had been completed, that appraisal was given to Morgan
Stanley and that was on® of the factors they considered in
coming up with $125 per share price?
MR. BENDER:

That is correct, and that is why we

allege that Morgan Stanley rendered a fraudulent appraisal
because, gentlemen, hare is a situation where $772 is the
breakup value of an asset.

Now, what is happening?

The

majority stockholder has simply, at its time and at its price,
decided to pay--and only for the purposes of appearing
generous--upping th® price to $150 and is in effect paying the
total minority of

25,000 shares approximately $3,800,000.

And what are they getting back from the minority?

They are

getting back the tdtal equity interests of th® minority in

32
tills corporation, which is truly worth close to $20 million.
Q

Mr. Bender, suppose the corporation in this

short-form merger had offered minority stockholders the

$772.

Would you be here?
MR. BENDER:
Q

No, 1 would not, Your Honor.

You are not attacking the validity of short-

form mergers?
MR. BENDER:

Not per se.

I only say in this

particular case that was a means, a device, utilized and
abused to eliminate the minority at a fraudulently low price
which the majority knew to be fraudulently low.
Q

Let me ask you this question.

about liquidation.

You are talking

Any number of stocks on the New York

Stock Exchange sell at prices far in excess of liquidating
value.

Let us turn these'figure around.

Suppose the

market price of this stock by the appraisal of one of these
investment banking houses such as the one you mentioned were
$772 and the liquidating value were $150.

Would a fraud have

been committed, on you if the liquidating value had been
offered?
MR. BENDER:
g

Of course it would because—

You want it either way.

MR. BENDER:

Justice Powell, with all due deference

to the assumption behind the question, it is not that I want
it, either way.

I want it that the, stockholder be treated

33

honestly.

Honesty requires in a situation like this that if

the fair market value is $772, naturally he is entitled to
that.

And if the majority stockholder knows that the shares

are not being traded at all, which is this situation and yet
knows that he himself can go out and sell these timberlands
for $320 million and pocket that $320 million, if he only
pays the minority shareholder on a pro rata $150, he is
gaining the difference between that $150 and $772.
be a clearer case of misappropriation?

What could

He did not ask the

minority stockholder would h@ sell it at $150.

He told him,

"I am taking your stock at $150, like it or not."
Q

Hr. Bender, is it correct that your legal

theory is that the fraud consists in the failure to make any
disclosure before the transaction is completed?
MR. BENDER;
Q

My legal theory is—

Because you do not complain of the adequacy

of the disclosure after the transaction is completed,
MR. BENDER;
moment.

We do, but I will explain that in a

The legal theory is this.

But it is more than non-disclosure.

Yes, it is non-disclosure.
It is a knowing taking.

It is a knowing devaluation, a knowing undarvaluating.
Q

Why does that have to be so?

Why would not

under your theory any non-disclosure—it is a material non­
disclosure if you do not tell the minority shareholder anything
until the short-form merger is completed.

34
MR. BENDER;

Because the important thing here is

that a fiduciary owes a duty—
G

Of disclosure in advance; is that not your

point?
MR. BENDER;

More than that,

of a self-deal.

He is

sitting on both sides of the table.
Q

I really want to understand your theory-—

MR. BENDER;
0

It must be effectively fair.

—-Mr. Bender.

I am trying to understand your

theory, not to debate it with you.
MR. BENDER;
Q

That is what I want to say too.

Is it critical to your case that there was no

disclosure before the transaction was completed?
MR. BENDER;

I would say this, that on the facts as

they have been presented, it is not critical because in my
opinion, whether or not a majority stockholder discloses the
facts beforehand or not is irrelevant in a case where he has
the ability with a 95 percent ownership to force the transac­
tion on the minority and still deliberately undervalue.

But

I am stronger than that because I also have non-disclosure.
Q

Would you b® here if the disclosure had been

ten days in advance of the—
MR. BENDER;

I would still be hare if the disclosure

had been ton days in advance.
Q

Sot you do not quarrel with the Delaware

35

procedure then?
MR. BENDER:
Q

Pardon me?

You do not quarrel with the Delaware procedure.

You just say—
MR. BENDER:

I do quarrel with the Delaware

procedure because as far as we are concerned, the Delaware
procedure is unconscienable.

As Judge Hays stated“in the

Marshal case, a majority cannot eliminate a minority simply
by voting his shares under regular corporate processes.
what did they do here?

So,

Under Delaware law, without any

business purpose, they create a dummy corporation solely for
the purpose of eliminating the minority.
Q

Am I correct in believing you say all of these

30 state short-form merger statutes conflict with Rule 10b-5?
MR. BENDER:

In my opinion, sir, they all do conflict

because they are performed without any notice to the stock­
holders and—
Q

Would they not also conflict if they provided

for notice in advance but did not give the minority share­
holder the option to say no?

It would still conflict if I

understand your theory correctly.
MR. BENDER:
Q

Any freeze-out violates XQb-5.

MR. BENDER:
violates 10b-5„

In my opinion, any freeze-out—*

Any freeze-out without business purpose

I add without business purpose because the

36

purpose here is just to create a dummy corporation for
eliminating the minority.
Q

On the business purpose point, what is the

minority shareholder's reason for being interested in business
purpose if business purpose justifies getting him out of the
company?
MR. BENDER:
Q

Well—

He has no interest in the business purpose

after he is out.

So, why should that be critical?

MR. BENDER:

But business purpose means a purpose

other than just to eliminate the minority.

These stock­

holders—it is like the Court said in Lebold—
Q

I understand what it means, but 1 would be

interested in your answer to the question.
MR. BENDER:

I am sorry.

Why is it relevant—why do you attach so much

significance to the business ptirpose of the surviving company
as a justification for eliminating the squeezed out share­
holder?
MR. BENDER:

the merger.

It is not the business purpose of the

It is the business purpose of consummating

And there must b@ a business purpose to

consummate the merger, not just t© line the pockets of the

In this particular case the sole

purpose of the merger was to increase the ownership of the

majority stockholder from 95 percent to 100 percent, and also
to cheat them at. the same time.
Q

But leaving out the also to cheat,

the first

part., accepting everything you say, how doss that conflict,
with Rule l.Ob-5?

I want to

my philosophical opinion.

You have asked me for

My philosophical opinion is that

it is wrong to squeeze out. a minority stockholder when the
parent corporation is a continuing public company.

And Santa

Fe was a continuing public company, and all they ware doing
was—
Q .

Not after they own a hundred percent of the

38
stock, it is not.
MR. BENDER:

Santa Fe was still a continuing—the

parent is still a continuing public.

All they were doing

was squeezing out the minority in one finger of their giant
enterprise.
Q

Mr. Bender, it seems to me that you are arguing

the old doctrine of vested constitutional right of a stock­
holder never to squeezed out or cashed.
MR. BENDER:

Your Honor, this is why I cautioned —

mad® my comment to Justice Stevens»

I really d© not think—

and it really detracts from my argument to get into the
question of whether or not my personal philosophy and what I
believe happened here also is necessarily a violation of
10b-5.

That is really the perimeter of my case.

And I want

to focus on what I consider to be-—and what you asked before,
Justice Powell or Justice Stevens, I forget—as to what the
heartland of my case is.

In heartland my case is this, 'that

when a majority stockholder with his 95 percent ownership
uses that 95 percent ownership solely for the purpose of
increasing his own onwership from 95 to 100 and at. the same
time knows that the true value of the shares of the minority
is $772 and deliberatley undervalues those shares at $150,
then he has misappropriated the difference $150 and $772, and
it is an intentional misappropriation under Ernst £ Ernst.
And for that reason, we have a clear 10b-5 fraud case, and

39

they used the device—
Q

But, Mr. Bander—

MR. BENDER:
Q

—of the short-form merger statute.

—if this is the heart of your case, then in

every short-form merger case or every merger case, all the
minority shareholder has to do is allege that the shares have
a higher value than they have offered me.
MR. BENDER:

Mo.

Your Honor, I am glad you asked

that question because this is what we stated in our brief.
It is not like we the plaintiffs came in and said this value
is $772 a share.
Q

Or they allege it is higher and the other side

knew it and did not disclose it, did not say so.
MR. BENDER:

Right.

It is their own knowledge that

we are alleging.
Q

Let me ask you just one question.

When you

get into the state appraisal proceeding, can you show the
valuation of $320 million?
MR. BENDER:
Q

Pardon me?

Can you show in evidence?

MR. BENDER:

oh, certainly we can.

But that still

does not give us an adequate protection because you have
stockholders with ten shares, a hundred shares strewn throughout
the whole United States.

And what it means to go to the State

©f Delaware is ©very stockholder has to retain an attorney and

40

get an appraisal»

You know, Your Honors, that as a practical

matter, all of the stockholders are not going to do that»

And

that is the reason these corporations proceed this way, and
in Delaware, because the net effect is that if 20 percent ©f
the minority goes to Delaware, that means they have already
gotten away with the misappropriation on 80 percent and, to
the extant that Delaware does not give a proper and full
remedy, then that means as to the other 20 percent they are
still going to gain there»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. GLENDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GLENDON:

The plaintiff I think proceeds from an

erroneous assumption as to the facts of life in this case.

He

is taking an asset valuation and basing on an asset valuation,
which is only one ©lenient of stock valuation, is charging a
fraud and charging undervaluation.

Of course that just is not

the fact—
Q

We assume, do w@ not, that there was under­

valuation for the purposes of this case?
MR. GLENDON:

For the purpose of the motion—

MR. GLENDON:

—we of course have to concede.

W® do

not, however, concede anything lik© the values—
Q

W®

the allegation that the majority stockholder knew it was worth
more?
MR. GLENDON;

No.

There was no such allegation.

They do not make that allegation, and that is the point here.
You have to read their complaint.

They charge as a legal

conclusion that there was a fraudulent appraisal.

But you have

45
to consider it in the light of what was disclosed.

And every

fact that the plaintiff says constitutes a fraudulent
appraisal was disclosed.

Would your case be different if

we took it as true that the majority stockholder did know it?
MR. GLENDON;

Knew that there was a fraudulent

appraisal?
Q

No, not knew that it was fraudulent but knew

that the stock was worth more than the appraisal.
MR. GLENDON;

And did not disclose it.
