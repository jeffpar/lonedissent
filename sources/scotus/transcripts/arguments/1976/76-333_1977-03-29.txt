Mr. Bernstein, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BERNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BERNSTEIN:
this Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case arises under Title VII of the Civil

Rights Act of 1964.

its primary concern is the regard, if

any, to b® paid to a prior time-barred discriminatory act
a.n the application of a current, neutral,nohdiscriminatory
seniority system.
United Air Lines, like other domestic air carriers
in the United States, up until November of 1968, maintained
a. policy which required that its stewardesses, now called
flight attendants, be and remain unmarried.

In November of

1968 it entered into an agreement with the Airline Pilots
Association, the collective bargaining agent for the flight
aoosndants, abrogating this rule, offering reinstatement, tc
■chos© who had been terminated and who had protested through
company or Federal or State agencies the fact of the discharge.
Reinstatement was offered without back pay.
That policy was ultimately held in the case of
Sprogis v. United Air Lines in the Seventh Circuit to be a
discrimination on the basis of sax in violation of Title VII.

4
In February of 1968 Mrs. Evans, the respondent her®
resigned upon marriage.

She claims that it was involuntary,

that she was forced to resign, and sine® this arises- on a
motion to dismiss, that is admitted for th© purposes of this
proceeding.

At the time of her discharge, Title VII provided

that a charge claiming a violation of th® Act had to b@ filed
with th© Equal Employment Opportunities Commission within 90
days of the event.

It is conceded that Mrs. Evans did not

fil® such a charge within that time limit, and in fact did
nothing with respect to that for a period of 4 years.
In February of 1972 sh© applied to United Air Lines
for reemployment as a stewardess, and in fact was hired as a
new employer® at that time.

She was sent to training school,

along with other n@w employees, finished her training a month
later, and in March 1972 was assigned to th® line to assume
the duties of a flight attendant.

At that time, as tills Court

may know, it had already been decidsd that the limitation of
that position to members of the female sex only was a
violation and the job had been opened up to males as well as
females.
Sh@ worked as a stewardess, as a flight attendant,
from March 1972 upon completion of training until February of
1973, at which time she filed a charge with the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission in which sh© alleged that
it was a violation of the Act. for United to hav© refused to

5

eradit her with seniority for her earlier employment# which
ended in 1368# when it assigned her her seniority on rehir©
in 1972.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Bernstein# has United ever given

credit in other situations for prior services?
MR. BERNSTEIN;

Th© only tim® it has don© so# your

Honor# is when charges have been filed within the tim© limits.
That, is# there have been a number of instances where stewardesses
have complained within the appropriate tim© limits about
their termination# have been reinstated with full seniority.
That is a different situation.
QUESTION;

Those ar@ the only other times.

MR. BERNSTEIN;
QUESTION;

Pardon, sir?

I say those ar© the only other timass.

MR. BERNSTEIN;

That’s correct.

'There is nothing

in this racord to th@ contrary.
QUESTION;

And th® collective bargaining agreement

specifies nothing.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

That’s correct.

Thor© is a period

after termination in which seniority is lost.

Discharge

under these circumstances# it’s lost immediately.
Sh©

received in due course the parmissioa# tie

right-to-sue letter from th© EEOC# and suit was filed in
September of 1974.
later.

United answered, and I will allude to this

In its answer it admitted that the termination had bean

5

by resignation, but denied the allegation that it had been
involuntary.

It also added as an affirmative defense the

time limit issue, and then raised that by motion to dismiss.
The district court held that there was no continuing violation,
that the act of th© termination, assuming it to be discrimina­
tory, was completed long ago, th© 90-day limit had run on that,
and that it was not continuing consistent with decisions of
this Court and other courts, and I don't think there is any
issue here as whether or not a discharge is a completed act
and not continuing, and held that what she was really trying
to do in this case was to reassert a claim which had been
time-barred, namely, the 1968 termination of employment.
.The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals.
In the interim th© case of Collins v. United Air Lines bad been
decided in the Ninth Circuit where th© Ninth Circuit held
that a similarly situated former United stewardess who applied
for reinstatement after four years of unemployment did not
state a claim against th© company because there was no
continuing violation.

It held there was no obligation to

rehire.
When th® Seventh Circuit first was faced with the
Evans case on appeal, it determined, consistent with th©
district court, that there was no cause of action, no
continuing violation, action was based on a time-barred act,
and saw no difference between th® situation before it.

7
because United had voluntarily rehired Mrs. Evans,

and

the

situation in tha Ninth Circuit where United had refused to
reinstate Mrs. Collins,

so the result should be tha same

in any event, and affirmed the dismissal by the district
court.

It noted in a footnote that if the rule should be

otherwise, employers such as United Air Lines would have a
temptation not to rehire employees who otherwise would be
rehirabls because you get into this morass immediately upon
doing so, and that the situation should not be the same.
Petition for rehearing was filed, and pending the
determination on the ruling on a petition, this Court issued
its decision in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Company.
The Court of Appeals thereupon granted the petition, and on
rehearing reversed itself without reference at all to Collins,
to the problem of the time-barred first event, and said that
under Franks v. Bowman the relief requested could be granted.
Obviously Franks v. Bowman has some significance
to our position hare, and I would like to discuss that briefly,,
Franks did not involve, as this case did, the
question of a time-barred claim.

In Franks the issue was

whether, the court having found teat there was a discriminatory
act within tha time limits, by the way, teat a permissible
form of relief under Section 706(g) of tee Civil Rights Act
was to accord retroactive seniority.

And in that instance

it would have been seniority from the date teat the black

8
applicants who had been discriminatorily refused employment
as over-the-road drivers with Bowman Transport, when they
wera hired could get seniority credit back to the time of
first application.
in February of 1970.

In that case the charge had been filed
The record in thi3 case, the opinions

themselves —- wa examined your opinion and the opinion in th©
Court of App©als — were clear that there ware 200 --- it was
a class action, incidentally -- there were 206 applicants
concerned in that case, all of whom had applied for employment
after Jamiary 1 of 1970.

There simply could not have bean a

time limir question in that case.

None was ©vsr raised in this

Court.
What the Court held was that tha fact that section
703(h) of the Civil Right Act said that a bona fide seniority
system itself could not be the basis of a finding of a viola­
tion did not preclude the granting as an element of remedy
under 706(g), the remedial section of the Act, retroactive
seniority.

That would not stand in the way.

So Franks v.

Bowman presupposed th® proof of a discriminatory act within
the time limit and concerned itself only with the application
of remedy.
The fact is that there was a time limit problem in
Franks, but that had been disposed of in th© Court of Appeals
and never reached this Court.
Th© courts in Evans,u

th® Sup ram© Court interpreted.

9
that: to mean that the fact that a remssdy was available of
retroactive seniority under 706(g) mad® United's refusal or
failure to accord seniority for the prior employment an
offense under 703(h).
Now, United had never raised 703(h) as a defense.
Its

defense simply was you cannot prove a claim within the

tima limits provided by the Civil Rights Act.
the question of remedy.

We never gat to

You don't talk about remedy until

you have proved a violation,and non® had been proved,
the court mads up the argument for us.

well,

It said United's argument

appears to rest sub silentio on 703(h), and the Supreme Court
disposed of that in Franks.
I submit to you, your Honors, that the holding of
the Court of Appeals on Franks, and Evans jj

a complete

misreading of Franks, nothing to do with the case whatsoever.
In fact, tins NAACP, which has filed an amicus brief her© in
support of respondent concedes that, that Franks was not a
case involving timeliness, it really does not reach the issue.
Ws therefore submit that the Court of Appeals was simply in
error.

We have a simpla situation here where an act occurred,

action, was not taken within the prescribed time, that act is
gone.

It is as though it was a prs-Act violation.

A post-Act

violation on which the statute has run is no different posture
than a pra-Act violation.

This is our basic position.

Now, -there is on® other line of cases that have been

10
cited by comsel for respondent to support their position.
And these are the so-called departmental seniority cases
typified by United Papermakers in the Fifth Circuit, Quarles
in the District Court of Virginia, which are the leading cases
in this direction.

It may well be that those cases will stand

some review after your Honors have finished consideration of
the T.X.MoE case and the East Texas Motor Freight case which
ar© now pending before you, or soma challenges mad© to the
departmental seniority cases.
But in any event the departmental seniority cases
have no application here, because the theory there is teat a
facially neutral seniority system is in fact discriminatory
because it requires that, seniority be exercised on the basis
of seniority credits which employees were prohibited frcm
gaining bacaus© of prior unlawful practices.

So that although

it appears that the black employees in Papermakers, for
example, could bid into lines of progression formerly held by
white employees and whites could equally bid on the black
positions, yet no whit® would ever bid into a black position
because they wara the lower rated positions, lower paying
positions.

And since you have to bid on the basis of

departmental seniority, in order to move up into a higher
paying job, you have to sacrifice your existing seniority.
That’s an entirely different, question.

The point

there is that th@ courts have found that that kind of seniority

11
system is at that time a discriminatory act.

Th© system is

discriminatory.
Now, as I say, there is soma question as to whether
or not teat position is viable.

But

however

this court

may resolve the issues before it in the over-the-road cases
that you have under consideration

doesn't reach the point

her®.
Now, one way to bring this to a focus, to show that
inevitably -— inevitably -— respondent cannot prevail unless
reliance is placed on the time-barred 1968 Act, is to look
at the way this matter arose, simply the state of tee pleadings.
As I said, tear© was an allegation in te© pleadings that the
termination was involuntary and was forced by United Air Lines.
We have admitted only that there was a resignation.

It would

not be an illegal act, would not b@ a violation of tee Act
any time, had an employee voluntarily resigned upon being
married.

Wte no longer have the rale, and many stewardesses

and flighr. attendants still do resign upon getting married.
Th© percentage is not the same, but it is certainly not rare*
Th":.y aro numbered in th.cs hundreds.

Th@r© are still circumstances

in which marriage — tees woman withdraws herself from the job
market upon becoming married.

So th© mere fact of resignation

wouldn't b@ sufficient.
If this war® to b© sent back to tee district court,
for trial, sine© it stands on our answer denying it, it would

12
be encumbent upon the respondent to prove the fact that th©
resignation had bean involuntarily, in other words, that there
in fact had been a violation of th© Act.

But that would require

proof of a 1968 time-barred claim in order to sustain the
position here.
Now, this brings us around to th® Machinists v,
National Labor Relations Board, a decision arising under th©
National Labor Relations Act, and as this Court said in fch@
Franks case itself that analogies to that statute are
extremely helpful in applying Title VII of th© Civil Rights
Act.
QUESTION:

Before you go on with that —■

MR. BERNSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It's not clear.

You say there was no

burden on th® respondent her© to demonstrate that the 1968
termination was involuntary by showing, for example, that upon
her marriage her supervisor cam® and said, "Of course, you know
you have got to resign."

That would be th© x^ay you would

show the unvoluntariness, would it not?
MR. BERNSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Where is th® burden to show that?

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Th© situation is that since w@ have

raised this on a motion to dismiss, we have admitted all
matters wall pleaded, and sh© has pleaded that it was
involuntary enforced, so we have admitted it for this purpose.

13
Our position is it's irrelevant whether it was a discriminatory
act or not in 1968«,

Our point is whatever it was,

tirne-faarred, you can't enter into that.

that is

If this matter should

be tried, sine© w® have denied it in our answer, and the
motion to dismiss is not sufficiant for her to win if we lose
on that, she has to go back and prove har case.

Then she

would b© put on her proof as to the nature of her act, whether
it was voluntary or involuntary.
■

y

QUESTION?

Then the burden. is clearly on her.

MR. BERNSTEIHs

That's correct,sir.

But the point

is not the burden as much as that must be proved at that point
and sh@ must rely then on a 1968 time-barred act in order to
assert the point that in an application of a seniority system
i.n 1172 she should have been given credit for that servies
which ©nd@d in 1968.
If I may, I 'would like to allude to the Machinstsv National
Labor Relations
Board case.
-------———
—------ —

That was a 1960 cas®,

------------

and it arosa under 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act,
which is the analog of Section 703(d) of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act in that it provides that charges b© filed
with the National Labor Relations Board within six months of
the alleged unlawful labor practice, and under Titi® VII it's
tha unlawful employment practice, again, now, a six-months
period.

There the issue was what affect will be given to a

pre-10(b), pre-six months incident to cast light on an event

14
occurring within fch© 10(b) period.

In that case? an illegal

union security clause had been entered into in a collective
bargaining agreement.

It was illegal because at that tin»

th@ union did not represent a majority of the employees.

And

in order to enter into a union security clause, the union
must b© the majority representative.

A contract was entered

into, and of course sine© there was a union security clause,
employ©as had to join the union, so that vary soon the union
had a majority by operation of fch© clausa.
More than six months after the execution of the
contract but within fch© period of its enforcement, a charge
was brought against the employer and union alleging that this
was an unlawful labor practice under th© National Labor
Filiations Act.

Th® matter cam© before this Court, and it

was held that sinca fch© contract on its face was a completely
lawful, legal agreement, and its illegality, if any, could
only b® established by proof of what had happened at the
execution of th© contract more than six months earlier, that
such evidence was not admissible to prove a violation within
the limitations period.

And th® National Labor Relations

Board decision holding that in fact such evidence could be
adduced was reversed.
Now, w© submit, your Honors, we have th® sama
situation here.

There is simply nc way that respondent can

make out its assertion her© that United failed to credit her

15

with seniority earned up to 1968 in its present application
of its neutral, nandiscriminatory, tima-in-the-position
seniority system which the company now has, unless that is
proved, because this respondent in.1972 was in no different
position than a new employee who had naver worked for the
company or an employee who had quit clearly on a volu*ita2:y
basis four years ago, or an employee who had been fired for
cause, for theft, and then rehired four years latar.

In none

of those instances would it be suggested that any of these
employees war© entitled to any prior

seniority, and the only

distinction we could make among those groups and the respondent
here is that in fact she worked for United up to 1968 and was
terminated under this no marriage policy, a claim which is
time-barred.
QUESTION:

Is the analogy you see in the Machinists

cas© the limitation that case placed on the notion of a
continuing violation when you hav© a statute of limitations?
MR, BERNSTEIN:
points,

Well, sir, I think it goes to both

The Court did discuss th© concept of a continuing

violation in that cas®.

And it said that if in fact you were

to follow the theory of th@ Labor Board in that instance, the
violation would never ©ad.

As her©, respondent could hav©

waited 20 or 30 years and corns in arid said, "Well, back in
1972 you didn't

give me th® seniority I was entitled to and

therefor© there is a continuing violation."

It went to that

16
point as well as to the point when did the initial event
occur which started the* statute to run.
was the execution of the contract.

And they held that

Since that ran there was

no present defense.
QUESTIONS

If your opponents are right about the

seniority violation, then their argument is that the violation
is a continuing one and it's occurring every day.
MR. BERNSTEIN;

The point, however, your Honor,

about the seniority violation is that unless you rely on a
time-barred claim, the 1968 claim, there is nothing offensive
about the present seniority system.

In fact, the system is

not attacked, it’s the failure

put.

in terms of practice

it said that w® follow a practice of not giving her credit
for her prior employment.

And the point is that her prior

employment ended four years earlier, long beyond the determination of the statutory period.
Your Honor, I am responding to your question.

I

hope you will question m® if I am not.
QUESTION;

I am not sure how clear my question was.

You say you derive two principles from the Machinists case,
both of which you think helped you.
MR. BERNSTEIN;

Right.

Th® concept of the continuing

violation, I think, was laid to rest both in

IQE v.

Robbins & Myers earlier this term and in Johnson v. Railway
Express where time limit questions ware raised, one under 1981

17
and on® under Tifcl® VII, and the Court mad© clear that th©
act of discharge is the complete fact and the time limits
begin to run from that data.
in that.

There is no continuing concept

And I submit that the courts of appeal are uniform

in that, th® Eighth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, even the
Seventh Circuit agrees with that.
In Evans I, which was a two-to~one decision, even
in dissent, Judge Cummings said, ,eWa agree that there was no
obligation to rehire."

Thar© is no continuing violation.

Unless respondent can show that somehow he can sustain his
position without reliance on a time-barred event, there seems
to me to be a rather clear case.

I apologize for saying that.

Clear cases don't get up here, but it seams to me that it’s
crystal clear if th® time limits mean anything in Title VII,
^*hen it must foreclose the claim her®.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. LEVIN ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEVIN:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please th©

My name is Alan M. Levin.

I am with the Chicago law

firm of Dorfman, De Koven, Cohen & Laner, and I represent th©
respondent Carolyn Evans.
I would like to note in passing before proceeding
to argument that in the first placa w® have not yet had a

18

trial in this case. There has been no proof taken on whether
or not United applies a continuous time-in-service rul©
across the board.

I personally have met an individual flight

attendant with United who was not discriminated against by the
"no marriage" rule who did quit, who was rehired and was given
past service credit.
Now, I am net accusing Mr. Bernstein of lying or
anything like that.
QUESTION:
Mr. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

I am only suggesting —
Is she testifying her® today?
NO.
Well, if it’s not in the record, let's

not hear about it.
MR. LEVIN:

Excuse m©, your Honor.

By way of argument, Mrs. Evans5 cas® can be summarized
*-n a nutshell as consisting of two points:

First, that her

charg© was timely because it was filed during the pendency
of the employment practice which she is challenging, namely,
United’s practice with respect to her seniority whereby they
deny her credit for any time before 1972.
Secondly, that United’s practice with respect. to
her seniority is illegal, because it gives present vitality
United’s past open, admitted, across-the-board, pattern and
practiced discrimination of which Carolyn Evans is an
identifiable victim.
Th© real issue in this cas© is not one of timeliness.

19

At ©very stag© of this cas© w© have conceded and we concade
again that if Carolyn Evans were solely and simply attacking
the 1968 termination, her only effective avenue of relief
would b© by way of success in the McDonnell litigation cis a
class member in McDonnell» She is not seeding the back pay or
other monetary relief for the period 1968 to 1972.

That's

th© penalty she suffered for not. filing her charge within
90 days of the '68 termination.
QUESTION s

Do you concede if there were a back pay

claim, it would ba barred?
MR. LEVIN;

For 1968 to 1972, yas, Mr. Justice

White. '
QUESTION;

How about reinstatement?

MR. LEVIN;

You ar@ referring to the Collins case,

I assume, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

I am not referring to anything.

I am

just asking you a question.
MR. LEVIN:

Reinstatement of employment or of

seniority, your Honor?
QUESTION;

Assume that she had not been hired and

that she asked for reinstatement.
MR. LEVIN:

That's a different case.

I believe that

QUESTION:

Is it any different than back pay claims?

MR. LEVIN:

It could be different potentially if it

t

*

could ba shown that United's refusal to retire would have bean

20
based or was in fact based upon prior discrimination, in
°th©r words, that United said, "Because we discriminated against
you in the past, wa are not going to rehir© you."
QUESTION;

They just say, "We are full now, we

haven8t got any places for people."
MR. LEVIN:

I think that, would be a different cas©

then, and I think that —
QUESTION:

It's like the back pay claims, then.

MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You mentioned the refusal to rehir®.

As I understand it the "no marriage" rule was terminated in
f

November of 1963.

Is -there anything in the record that

indicates why your client was not employed after that period
and before 1972?

Was it a refusal to rehire situation?

MR. LEVIN:

As a matter of fact, for four years

until she was rehired, she made several efforts to be rehired
and was turned down.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:

She was not represented by counsel.,
Are those alleged in the complaint?
Yes, they are, your Honor.

QUESTION:

I just missed them.

QUESTION:

Mr. Levin, what if your client's claim

hers, instead of being under the employment section of the
Civil Rights Act, was under the open housing section and she
assarted that sh@ had been discriminatorily denied housing in
3.968 and then she came back in 1978 and assarted sh© had been

21
discrirain.afcori.ly denied fcha same house she wanted fco buy in
’68, she again fcri©d fco buy in 378.

Do you think she could

resuscitate any part of her '68 claim by making a claim of
discrimination with respect fco the same hous© 10 years later?
MR. LEVINs

Mr» Justice Rehnquist, I believe the way

you have posited the facts, it would be different from our
cas® and I don’t believe? tha claim could be resuscitated unless
a continuing pattern could be shorn.

On the facts as you hav®

stated them, I don’t sees a continuing pattern.
We are dealing her© with seniority, which is a
special kind of an animal, a special kind of an employment
animal«

It is based upon the past.

It necessarily looks to

^•h© past, operates in the presentj it looks to tha future as
wall and operates in fch© futur©.
on-the-job policy.

W© are talking about an

W@ ar® not necessarily stating that an

employer has an obligation to rehir© a past discriminate©, but
w© are saying that an employer one© he hires somebody, has to
treat that parson with fairness and not give present vitality
to past discrimination.
l‘think fch® bast analogy I could give would be under
the wage and hour lav?.

If an employer says to a prospective

applicant, “I am not going to hir© you because I can only
afford to pay you $1.90 an hour," and fch© employe® says,
"Well, that’s 40 cants below the minimum wage," and runs down
fco his nearest regional office of the U.S. Department of Labor

22

and files a claim.

He is going to be told his employer has

no obligation to hire him.

But once the employer hires him,

suppose the employee agrees to work for $1.90, the employer
says fine, he hires him.

The next day the employee can go

down to the U.S. Department of Labor and file a claim, and
the employer will be told that there is no such waiver in
that case, that once you hired the man, you had the obligation
to pay him the minimum wage.
tie have an analogous claim here.

Once United

rehired Carolyn Evans, it couldn’t treat her like a stranger
because she was in fact no stranger.
QUESTION:

If your rule were adopted by the Court,

it would certainly put soma pressure on United not to ever
rehire anybody who might, have had a claim against them in the
past, wouldn't it?
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I suspect -'chat

it is the very rare employer indeed who rehires an employee
wnc has previously been discharged for discriminatory reasons
unless he is ordered by a court to do so.
carolyn Evans was not hired out of the goodness of
United's heart.

United got an experienced, mature employee

who was better than the average crop of employee coming

That would be closer to our case.

Evan today as Carolyn Evans flies for United Air
Lines, she suffers a current loss of benefits, a loss of
wages, a loss in vacation.

She suffers a loss in the area

of flight assignment selection, rights to retention in case
of layoff, because of United's current practice with respect
to her seniority.
QUESTION:

Is there any time limit to liar bringing

a suit such as this on your theory?

Could she wait for 20 or

3 0 years and then --MR. LEVIN:

Hr. Justice Blackmun, if she were to

file today, it would be our contention that she would still
be timely.

But Section 706(g) of the Act places a 2-year

limitation on back pay recovery.

So in terms of financial

recovery, whenever she were to file the claim, sh® would be
limited to 2 years of back pay.
Furthermore, if, unlike this case where United has
not once claimed that it has been prejudiced by the timg;
delay, United argues about claims in the future, not about
this case.

But if in the future an employee could demonstrat®

actual prejudice

in defense on the merits, then conceivably

the court could apply the doctrine of laches.
QUESTION:

But you don't get. to a doctrine of laches

24
where you have congressionally specified statute of limitations,
do you?

That's Congress saving the claim shall not be filed

after such a date.
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, I believe in this

case that Congress has not barred this case with the time
limitation of 706(e).
QUESTION:

But should there be a doctrina of laches

at all if it is not time-barred by the congressional action?
MR. LEVIN:

I believe this would be similar to the

veterans reemployment casas where, while there was a one-year
statutory protection period, the courts have traditionally
appliad the doctrine of laches to bar claims which are deemed
to be stale for evidentiary reasons.

And that essentially is

the argument which is being made by -the company in this case.

was timely when judged by the standards in the legislative
history when Congress considered amendments to Titi® VII in
1372.

Specifically Congress stated that it was accepting the

judicially created doctrine that certain violations are deemed
to be continuing in nature, that a charge is timely when
filed during the pendency thereof or at any time up to 130
days after the last occurrence of the practice.

In addition,

you have to couple thafcwith section 706(g) of the Act which
limits back pay relief to 2 years, which would have significance
only in a continuing violation case.
And to refer again to the veterans reemployment
caises r this Court in 1949, in the Oakley case and the Ila/nes
case, at 338 U.S. 278, two 1949 decisions, recognized on the
escalator theory of seniority that a veteran could raise a

26

claim for a denial of seniority credit from his original date
of hire even after the one-year statutory protection period
had run.

There is no time limit issue in this case.

Her

United has never disputed the fact that the

challenged seniority practice, is a current one.

It has never

disputed that the seniority practice itself is a continuing
one.

It has never really disputed the proposition that if the

seniority practice is illegal, then the charge was timely.
United has never alleged prejudice against them on their
ability to defend on the merits.
In saying that the only violation that occurred in
this case occurred in 1968, United is really saying that the
statute of limitations should be held to have run before the
violation was even committed.

The violation challenged in this

case didn't even begin t.o occur until after Carolyn Evans was
rehired in 1972.
QUESTION:

I thought you said at the outset that

it began when she was involuntarily terminated in 1968.
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I am referring to the

specific current practice which she is challenging, the practice
with respect to her seniority.
Now, it is our contention that that practice is
illegal because it gives present vitality to,perpetuates the
effects of the past discrimination against her in 1968.
Unitec Air Lines is openly relying on that past act.

of discrimination, an open, admitted policy across-the-board

case as creating a break in service to deprive Carolyn Evans
of benefits and seniority today.

And then they tell us that

We submit that it. is a basic, established, accepted
principle of Title VII law, has been for at least the last
9 years, from this Court for 6 years, that United cannot b@
permitted to perpetuata the effect of past discrimination
through its current practice.
Th© principle we raly on is as follows: that where
a present employment practice,characteristically a seniority
practice, v/hich is so characteristically tied to the past
operates in the present, looks to -the future, where such a
practice, to use United's words, is inexorably tied to and
tainted by past discrimination, as they say was true in th©
Papermakers case, and where that present practice extends and
perpetuates th© past discrimination into the present resulting
in loss and disadvantage to th© identifiable victim of that
past discrimination in -the present, then we say that that
present practice is illegal.
ago.

EEOC said

this several years

Eight courts of appeals have agreed with th® principle in

th© seniority area.

Congress recognized th© principle when it

cited the Papermakers case with approval in considering
amendments to Title VII in 1972.

This Court recognized the

28

principle that present facially fair employment practices that
perpetuat® the effects of past discrimination ar© illegal in
the Griggg case in 1971.
We submit that that principle fits the Evans case
like a glove.

She is the identifiable victim of past open

adjudicated discrimination.

Sh© suffers today due to a current

superficially neutral but no less damaging policy which gives
present vitality to that past'discrimination.

QUESTION:

Mr. Levin, could I interrupt, because I

want to the thrust of your theory.

Supposing instead of your

particular client you had a person who had been married prior
to '68 and applied for a job with United, say in 867, was
turned down because she was married, and then sh® is employed
at this time so that sh® didn’t work for the year '67 to '68
because of the no-marriage, rule.

Would she have the same claim

Your client, does to seniority for that period of denial of
employment on account of her marriage?
MR.LEVIN:

Sha could under that theory.

It isn't

necessary for the Court to hold that to ba the case, Mr.
Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Why not?

29

MR. LEVIN;

Sh© could —

Well, in this case, our

contention includes th® fact that Carolyn Evans actually worked
for United Air Lines from 196S to 1968 and that she in .service
as a past employee.
QUESTION:

But th© wrong that she complains of is

the fact that she was treated unlawfully.

You are not really

seeking seniority for th© period subsequent to the illegal act;
you are seeking seniority for th© time whan, they treated her
perfectly lawfully.

In other words, sha was employed up until

1968.
MR. LEVIN;
QUESTION:

Yes, she was, your Honor.
But she is not getting credit for that

seniority because of an illegal act in ®68.
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

That is true, your Honor.
Now, why wouldn’t another comparably

situated qualified stewardess who was denied employment on the
same data as a new employee, why wouldn’t sh® be entitled to
make the same argument?
MR.LEVIN:

Th© second half of my answer is going to

be that I believe that sha should ba entitled to relief.
I was going to suggest a possible distinction.

I believe sh®

should get relief, and this is in fact the Acha case which
was decided by the Second Circuit, th© New York City police
woman case.
QUESTION:

In fact, should your client not — if you

30
are correct, should your client not merely gat relief for fcha
four years, but for the four years plus whatever additional
time sha would have worked but for the unlawful discharge?
MR, LEVIN:

Exactly, Mr. Justice Stevens.

And we

ate going for both constructive and actual seniority.
QUESTION:

Your whole complaint is that she was

illegally fired.
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:

That she has been illegally fired.
Yes.
And that through its present action,

United gives present effect to that past discrimination.
QUESTION:

It all goes back to that.

And yet you

can’t get any action for that firing in any court, any place
in the world.
MR. LEVIN:

Solely for that which she lost because

of 'the '68 discrimination.

That is true.

On the other hand,

nobody twisted United Air Lines9 arm and told them to ignore
Carolyn Evans' seniority for 1966 to 1968.
QUESTION:

But United could hava evaded it very

simply by not rehiring her.
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

That is true.
Mr. Levin, are you going to discuss the

Th© Machinist,:;; case is clearly distinguishable from

look at the Machinists case.

First, l©t8s take a

It was decided under the National

Labor Relations Act in 1960, around th© time of the Steelworkers
trilogy decided by this Court.

At that time, as Mr. Justice

Harlan expressly stated in his opinion ~ I refer to 362 U.S.
428 «- the National Labor Relations Act was being viewed in
th® context of that casa as primarily a regulatory statute.
Th© chief concern in that opinion was institutional stability

By contrast, in the Evans case Title VII

In 1964 and 1972 Congress reiterated the fact, as

this Court recognized in Griggs and in Albemarle, that the
purpose of Title VII was remedial, a make whole purpose.
Congress recognized that it would be upsetting the applecart.
Institutional stability was not th© primary concern.
Secondly, th® statutory language.

Under the

National —
QUESTION:

Albemarle relied on Phelps Dodge for

allowing restitution to people who had bean discriminated
against.

And Phelps Dodge

arose under the National Labor

Relations Act, didn’t it?
MR. LEVIN:

I think what we are discussing here,

though, is an NLRA cas© which arose at a time, in 1960, with
a particular interpretation on Section 10<fo) of th® Act.

I

32
will agree that, ther© are appropriate analogies with 'the
National Labor Relations Act as this Court made clear in the
Franks case* but that the analogy doesn't apply here.
Th© second distinction that I would make is on the
statutory language.

Whereas the NLRA prohibits complaints

issuing based upon acts occurring prior to th© 6-month period,,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not us© those terms.
Titi® VII speaks in terms of challenging a practice occurring
within 180 days, the challenged practice.
But. more importantly, the legislative history is
really th© key difference.

As Mr. Justice Harlan stated in

th® Machinists case, 362 U.S. 426, Congress' policy was to
let sleeping collectiva bargaining contracts lie.

Congress

specifically, Mr. Justice Harlan said, specifically adverted
to the problem of contracts with minority unions, had
previously taken pains to protect minority unions against
belated attack, and had enacted 10(b) with that purpose in
mind.

In Title VII, by contrast, Congress has accepted th®

continuing violation theory, wrote in a two-year back pay
limitation rule, has implicitly indicated with those two
actions that there are cases whore an employer's past actions
can be brought in to assess responsibility, to assess
liability.

Congress was explicitly concerned with seniority

when it considered amendments to Title VII in 1972.
Congress specifically approved the Papemakers case.

And

33

We believe it is clear from the legislative history,
the cases that Congress accepted at the time it acted prior to
the 1972 amendments, that Congress intended to prohibit

the

practices %*hich in present operation perpetuate the affects of
past discrimination.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't on that basis, then, back pay

claims be eatertainabl®?
MR. LEVIN:

Back pay claims under what circumstances,

Tour Honor?
QUESTION:

Well, back pay claims for periods beyond

the 6 months.
MR. LEVIN:

Well, Congress had said that back pay

claims would ba recognizable beyond the 6-month period.
QUESTION:

I know, but you apparently agree it took
./ •

a special provision to do that.

Your claim her© is that

without any provision like that, you can make the seniority
claim.
MR. LEVIN:

W© aren't seeking back pay, and there

is no prohibition in 7QS{g) —
QUESTION:

I know, but on your theory you wouldn't

need any special provision to get back pay.
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

That is true, your Honor.
Well, you conceded that without it, you

wouldn't have it.
MR. LEVIN:

No.

Excuse-me, your Honor,

without.

34

706 (g) (. it is our contention, that the principle would still
be valid, but that 706 (g) is evidence of Congress' intention
when it was considering the 1972 amendments to Title VII.
QUESTION:

You say, I suppose, that 706 (g), in the

absence of that you might b© able to get back pay for 8 or
10 years, that Congress has cut off a right that would otherwise
exist.
MR. LEVIN:

It does cut both ways, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Earlier in this argument, if I understood

you correctly, you conceded that you would not have a back
pay claim hare on your theory.
MR. LEVIN;

Earlier than 1972, Mr. Justice White.

We do seek back pay for the seniority differential since
1972.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1 o'clock.
[Whereupon, at 12 noon, the argument, was recessed
until 1 p.m. the same day.]

(1 p.ra.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levin, you may continue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. LEVIN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LEVIN:

(RESUMED)

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to return to the point that was being
discussed just before the luncheon recess that was raised by
Mr. Justice Whit© and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

In reference to

Section 706(g) of the Act, in order to avoid any question
that I might have misstated Congress' purpose, it is true that
the legislative history demonstrates that the 2-year limitation
was essentially intended to limit back pay relief so that
there wouldn't be an unlimited period.
°ur position is that th© fact that there still is a
2-yaar limitation psriod, as opposed to a 6-month filing
period, is evidence for th© acceptance of the theory of a
continuing violation and th® impact of past acts.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:

So what about reinstatement?
Ar© w© talking about reinstatement of

employment, Mr. Justice White?
QUESTION':

I am talking about reinstatement of a

person who was discriminatoriiy discharged and asked for
reinstatement after 6 months.
MR. LEVIN:

Our position would be that if it could

36

be demonstrated that the employee's decision not to rehir® the
person —
QUESTION:

That was your answer the last time.

your answer to the next question the same, too?

Is

Let's

assume that he just says, "I am full, I haven't got any
places."
MR. LEVIN:

Then presumably the employer's reason

is a nondiscriminatory reason and we would hold that that
case is distinguishable, on that basis.
I would also like to return to a point which was
made by Mr. Bernstein regarding the Papermakars case.

Mr.

Bernstein indicated that under Paparmakers there was a present
discriminatory seniority policy.

I believe that an alternative

interpretation of that case is more suitable and correct, that
is, that the Court in Pap& makers found that the seniority
practices in issue were in fact facially neutral and arrived
at the discriminatory nature thereof only by reference to past
discrimination which was incorporated.

And, in fact, in that

case plaintiffs did have to prove the existence of past
discrimination.

The past discrimination there was in hiring.

I would suggest also that there are strong policy
reasons for accepting the principle advanced by Mrs. Evans
hers.

If this Court reverses the Evans decision, we feel

that it. may he. well nigh impossible in the future to attack
the non-overt, non-obvious, subtle but pervasive practices

37

in employment which do in fact extend discrimination into the
present, be it in a departmental seniority system, seniority
practices, an employment seniority system, promotional system,
possibly in the testing area as well.

Because the only really

affective way to get at subtle but pervasive discrimination
is by looking at the roots of the practice, the historical
background of the practice, how did it originate, what effect
does it have.

If w© can't look at that, than I submit that the

really pervasive form of discrimination in our society today
may be untouchable, because the days of the overt and the
obvious seem to be passing.

Seldom, if ever, or less often

than before, do we s@® explicit signs of discrimination.
Jews need apply.
apply.

No blacks need apply.

No

No Catholics need

Today the prevalent form of discrimination is subtle,

and we believe that the way to get at it is with the principle
we hava here.
An upholding of the Evans decision, far from opening
a Pandora's Box, will keep open a necessary avenue of relief
under Title VII.
QUESTION;

As on® of the Justices suggested, however,

to affirm will mean that all the incentive on the part of
an employer to reemploy a person in th© posture of your client,
not only is the incentive removed, there is a disincentive to
hire them, isn't there?
MR. LEVIN;

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

38
that problem, if it exists, is in. fact de minimis, because
I think that it —
QUESTION:
person involved.

It isn’t de minimis for the particular

It runs on whether the concern is addressed

to the particular individual or to the generality of womankind
in this situation.
MR. LEVIN:

What I am suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice,

is that it is rare for an employer to rehire a past
discriminatae.

I am also suggesting that if it can b©

demonstrated that the employer's action is in fact based upon
past discrimination, that he doesn51 rehire because th© person
is a past discriminatae, that that would be closer to our
case, different from th© Collins case.
If the Court has no further questions, I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Bernstein?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Yes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BERNSTEIN ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, th©

point that you just mads concerning th© disincentive to hire
was made by -the court of appeals in Evans I.

It seemed to

concern them very much, although it completely ignored it in
Evans II.

The same point has disturbed th© district court in

California last year in a casa in which it attempted to

39

reconcile

Collins and Evans and expressed soma concern about

the dichotomy now between these cases, that it was perfectly
all right not to rshira, but once you did, you ran into these
hosts of problems that have been raised here.

That was ^ennan v.

Pan Am cited in the briefs.
I wish to respond very briefly to some of the points
made.

We agree there can be a continuing violation.

question about that.

No

And we agree that if there is a continuing

violation, that the statute now provides as a result of the
1972 amendments that there can be a 2-year period of back pay.
But that 2-y©ar period is a limitation of liability, not a
statute of limitations point.

Up to that point, the limitations

for back pay was drawn from the various State laws, as it is
now under Section 1931 of the earlier Civil Rights Act, in
order to make uniform a back pay period when the 1972 amendments
wer© passed.

Griggs is a good example of a continuing

violation where an employer at the time of litigation required
the passage of a Wunderlich test and the maintenance of a high
school diploma in order to progress into higher paying jobs.
That was going on, and the employer attempted to justify that
and this Oourt said that it had a disparate effect now and
therefore was now discriminatory, even though facially neutral,
because the requirement for the test and a diploma were
required of blacks as well as whites is neutral.

The fact is

that the whites could more readily meet the requirement than

40
the blacks, and it was therefore hgsld to be now a discrimination
and a continuing discrimination.

That is not the case here.

There is no contention here, there never has been,
that the United seniority system, which is based on date of
hir®, is discriminatory in any way with respect to race, sex,
or in any other manner.

In fact, I think that has been

completely conceded all along.

United5s seniority system is

not being challenged.
Th© thesis stated in respondent's brief on page 14
is this:

"By relying on the 1960 termination as creating a

break in service, and giving effect to that break in service in
its current seniority practice with respect to Mrs. Evans,
United is actively enabling that prior discrimination to reach
effectively into the present. "

what it was.

It says w© are trying it as

Yes, we are.

We concede that's exactly

It was a break in service, and it would b® a

break in service for any employe©, no matter how that break
occurred.

But th© fact that w© do not give credit for that

brask. in service in 1972 doss not create a present discriminatory
act as counsel insists.

It is inevitable.

Thera is no way

you can get to this point without relying on a time-barred claim.
United was as sensitive to the civil rights movement
as is counsel, and I don't -think it's encumbent upon us to
defend ourselves here,

we

concede for th© purposes of this

case that the "no-marriaga" ruls was a violation up until 196 8

41

when we abandoned it.

And we concede that if Miss Evans had

fil@d the charge within 90 days of her termination, she would
have bean back working long ago with full seniority and full
back pay.
