MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Richland.» I think you may proceed whenever you're
readyc
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. BERNARD RICHLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RICHLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We come here by certiorari to the 2nd Circuit Court
of Appeals in a matter of great concern to my city , and a
matter

which I suggest is and should be of concern to every

government official who has it in his power to appoint and
to remove non-tenured officials who serve at his will and
discretion.
The issue represented in the narrow sense, as I
see it* is may a non-tenured municipal employee, who may be
dismissed at will, be dismissed without a hearing when his
personnel record contains derogatory matter which can be
examined by prospective employers only with the written
permission of the dismissed employee?
And in the broader sense — and that arises out of
the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals here —• can such
an employee be so dismissed when his record might at some
time in the future be examined by interested prospective

4
employees with or

without such express permission?

QUESTION s
his permission?

Well, how would they get it without

I thought you said, they must have his

permission„
MR. RICHLAND 2

Under the specific rule of this

case, under the specific facts of this case, permission was
granted.

And it was as a result of the permission being

granted that the inspection was permitted.
However, there is implicit — and I think to a
considerable degree explicit — in. the opinion of the Circuit
Court of Appeals — which incidentally was decided before
this Churt decided Paul and Bishop -— that goes quite beyond
that.
QUESTIONS

That's not realistic, is it?

It's not

realistic when a man applies for a job, and he says, you
worked for the city of New York?
did you leave?

He says, yes.

And he says, I won’t tell you.

But why
He won’t

get employed, will he?
MR. RICHLAND %
true.

That's quite true.

That’s quite

And this is one of the necessary incidences of exempt

positions, of positions to which people are appointed at will.
I suggest as an example, and I've suggested it in
my brief, and I think it highlights what our problem is here.,
Suppose a Justice of this Court has a confidential clerk in
whom he has lost confidence because he believes, if you please,.

5
that he has a loose tongue and talks out of Court, and so
terminates him.

He then applies to the Chief Judge of our

Court of Appeals for a position as confidential clerk.

And

Chief Judge BritelX calls the Justice of this Court, and
says, what about this man?
I submit, not only

Under the ruling of this case,

could the Justice of this Court not tell

him, but there is doubt as to whether or not he was permitted
to pick up the telephone to answer the call because of this

j
case ~~
QUESTION:

You don't go a little bit further, and

say, or be allowed to live?
go on this?

I mean, how far are you going to

You're talking about policemen.

MR. RICHLAND%
QUESTION:

You're talking about civil service jobs.

MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION;

I'm talking about policemen.

I'm talking about a policeman.,

There’s no judges on Civil Service rolls.

So let's talk about Civil Service.
MR. RICHLAND:
that.

I suggest the rule is broader than

But if you leave it strictly to policemen, and make

a special exception so to exempt this Court and its justices”"
QUESTION:

I didn’t say policemen, I said civil

service employees.
MR. RICHLAND:

Civil service employees?

I have

800 civil service employees, many of which —
QUESTION:

Did the Court of Appeals limit its

6

ruling to civil service employees?
MR. RICHLAND:

It did not.

It did not purport

to limit it to anyone.
QUESTION:

During the first year — do I understand

correctly, during the first year probation they can be
dismissed at any time?
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

At any.time.

At any time.

MR. RICHLAND:

At any time.

It's part of the

appointing process, as a matter of fact.
QUESTION:

The law clerks on the highest court of

New York, or other courts in New York, are on the same basis,
I suppose?

That is, they can be dismissed at will.
MR. RICHLAND:

They can be dismissed at will.

Just

as your own confidential secretary could be dismissed at will.
Just as my own confidential assistant can be dismissed at will.
QUESTION:

During the first year then, the law-

clerks are in about the same posture as a probationary
employee?
MR. RICHLAND:
tenured.

Exactly, exactly.

They are non-

They have no property right in their position.

That is exactly what the situation is here.

And I suggest

that it is utterly impossible to properly operate a
government in whichconfidentia1 assistants are necessary,
in which exempt personnel are necessary, under this kind of

7

mil ing.
And 1 suggest that the ruling is utterly inconsistent
with the decisions of this Court last term, both the Paul
case and the Bishop case.

Obviously there was property

right possed by Mr. Velger in his job.

Obviously he held

his job at the will of the appointing officer.

And he was

dismissed.
QUESTION:

He is not asserting a right to due

process before he was dismissed,, is he?
MR. RICHLAND:

I suggest that he is not entitled
t

to due process

unless his liberty is impinged.

QUESTION:

Right.

I'm asking what the issue in

this case is.
'

MR. RICHLAND:

The issue in this case is whether

such a person can be so dismissed without violating his
liberties.
QUESTION:

Oh, I thought the issue involved a

disclosure.
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Thatfs right.

Of personnel files subsequent to this

dismissal.
MR. RICHLAND:

No, no.

The issue is whether or not

such a person can be dismissed when his file is likely to
be exposed, without having previously enjoyed a hearing.
And by hearing, I assume, a hearing with a full panoply of

8
cross-examination and appearance by counsel.
QUESTION:

Right.

But if his file had never been

disclosed, would there be any case here today?
MR. RICHLAND:

If his file —well, we wouldn't

be here today.
QUESTION: . Right.
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Bo disclosure —

MR. RICHLAND:
from now.

There’s no doubt about that.

But we miaht have bean here a year

He might have been here four years from now.
QUESTION:

But I’m talking aboiit this case —

MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

—- which involved disclosure of the fire,

is that correct?
MR. RICHLAND:

If there had been no disclosure,

even though the policeman in this case invited disclosure
by offering an authorization to his future employee and qiving
him permission to disclose it, of course we wouldn't be here.
But this is exactly what he did.
QUESTION:

And his disclosure, therefore, as my

brother Powell suggests, is the critical factor in this case.
MR. RICHLAND:

It is the potential of disclosure,

4

QUESTION:

No, it’s the fact of disclosure.

MR. RICHLAND:
Court

As I read the opinion of the Circuit

of Appeals -QUESTION:

Had there never been disclosure, and

were there never a disclosure, there would never be a cause

9
of action, would there?
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Well, it's the critical fact.

MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Of course not.

What's that?

How did it come to be disclosed?

MR. RICHLAND:

It came to foa disclosed when an

application was made by the discharged employee, to the
Penn Central police department.
QUESTION:

It's a private entity.

MR. RICHLAND:

It's a private entity.

him what his background was.
background was.

They asked him —

They asked

Ha told them what his

They then secured from him a written

authorization without which the police department would not
have granted them any information.

They took that to the

police department, and the police department allowed them
to see his records.
QUESTION:

So you. say that he made the disclosure.

MR. RICHLAND:

Of course he made the disclosure.

As

a matter of fact, there was a public disclosure that has been
made in this case, has been made by my friend in this case
by bringing this suit.
disclosure.

Before that there was no public

There was at most a private disclosure, with the

permission of the employee.
QUESTION:

Mr. Richland, if that argument is the

complete answer to the case, I suppose you'd take the same

10
position if the trial showed he was guilty of murder?
MR. RICHLANDs
QUESTION:

Why, of course.

No matter what stigmatising reason —

MR. RICHLAND % of course.
his remedy.

Of course.

And he has

If that were a false statement, or is a deliberate­

ly false statement.
QUESTION:

He has his remedy in the state courts.
What is his remedy?

MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

His remedy is action in defamation.

Well, how does he find out what the file

showed?
MR. RICHLAND:

If nobody finds out what the file

shows, what difference does it make?
QUESTION:

Well, the practical problem is thatif

he does not grant access, he cannot get another job.
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

I thought you conceded that earlier,

that if he followed the practice of saying, no, I won't let
you look at this, I won't tell you why I was fired,

. he’ll

never get another job.
MR. RICHLAND:

It doesn't necessarily follow.

There may be people that don't ask him.

There may be people

who don’t care what his record was in the police department.
QUESTION:
six minutes.

You changed that three times in the last-

You told me distinctly that you recognized that

that was the problem.

Didn’t you?

11
MR. RICHLAND:

Wo, I'm sorry.

If that is the

impression that your honor got., than I have certainly misspoken.
QUESTICM: Well, that is the impression that Justice
Clark had, and he put it in his opinion.

He said it was

assumed that this man couldn't get a job without it.

Didn't

he say that?
MR. RICHLAND:
is valid anyway.

I don't think that that assumption

He can get jobs all over the place.

has ever disqualified him.

Nobody

He has never been disqualified,

from any of the various civil service lists on which he has
been placed.

The only other police agency to which he applied,

and on which he relies in his appendix to his brief, sent
him a letter which says -- which ends up by saying, we thank
you for your interest in the Plainfield police division, and
wish you success in your future endeavors.

And that's not

any proof that he was rejected because of a failure to
produce his records or anything else.

And v/e're bound here

by our record.
QUESTIO?!:

Well, New York imposed no requirement

that he had to disclose his record in order to get another
job.

Those were requirements imposed by private employers.
MR. RICHLAND:

Of course not.

Of course not.

And i submit that —
QUESTION:

Just a question, Mr. Richland,

is

there any provision in your regulations for disclosure to the

12

discharged employee of the matter that was given to third
parties?

In other words, could he have gotten access to the

file himself?
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

I believe he could have.

I take it there’s nothing in the record

to show he made a request , other than the written interroga~
tory that you —
MR. RICHLAND:
made such a request.

There was no direct proof that he

case that I‘ think your honor should know, and that is that

and heard the statement of the Pennsylvania railroad

been disputed.

Mr. Velger did

That fact has never

And this, it seems to me, shows how tenuous

is this whole notion that the circumstance that there is
information in a file that is derogatory of some one in
itself requires that it not be dismissed at a hearing.
QUESTION:

Well, don’t you think the state ouaht

to have some reason to say it?

T-7hy should he go around —

why should he be bound to disprove anything that anybody says?
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:
in this report?

No.

Hell, I think —

That’s

Isn’t, it something that he could

Isn't it —• wasn't it put upon him to deny it?

Wasn't it put upon him to say that didn't happen at all?
This is a pure invention.
QUESTION;

Why?

I1R. RICHLAND:

Why was he obliged to deny it?
Because he was a provisional emplovee,

and if he is dismissed, he can be dismissed for no reason —

I understand you say that they were going to
Or they were not going to hire him.

Specifically,

your footnote 4 of the opinion says that they would have

MR. RICHLAND:

That is something that I do not

find any support for in the record.

QUESTION:

In New York, would he have had an action

the — you say, an action for slander or defamation

of some kind.

There’s no immunity for the police department

in such an action, is there?
•\

MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

No, of course not.

Nell, in some states there is.

MR. RICHLAND:

Besides which, he’s not a policeman,

he’s a former policeman.
QUESTION:

No, I'm talking about immunity of the

defendants who got up the file.

There would be no privileged

MR. RICHLAND:

There’s no such immunity.

There’s

QUESTION:

No privilege for assembling a file, a

personnel file, or anything like that.
MR. RICHLAND:

People who make false statements —

Except for the circumstance that x^hen there

And again I

Valger was right present in the courtroom and made

no attempt to deny that the incident took place.
QUESTION:

Well, was that an issue?

That wasn’t

an issue in the litigation?
MR. RICHLAND:

The issue in this litigation, as

framed by the pleadings, was whether or not ^in such
circumstances, a pre-determination hearing was essential in
order to dismiss a non-tenured employee who-.had. no property
right in his job.
QUESTION:

All right, let’s — taking that as the

issue, then whether or not this happened wasn't an issue
at all, in this litigation.
MR. RICHLAND: Whether or not what, your honor.
QUESTION:

Whether or not this actually happened

MR» RICHLAND:

Yes, but by nattering the issue in

that way do you foreclose the rational inquiring as to what

QUESTION:

the stand and deny or explain»

That was

not an issue in this

litigation at all, was it?
MR. RICHLAND:

Well, of course it wasn't»

It was

removed from litigation by the circumstance that he never
denied, that he never pretended that anything was otherwise.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the point of the liti­

gation was to establish his right to a hearing somewhere else,
rather than that he should have a hearing right in the District
Court o
MR. RICHLAND:

His right to — well, it was to establish

his right to a pre-determination hearing.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Well, is it not even narrower than that:

information in his files without notice to him.

That's not a complete answer.

Because

And his answer was, we just decided you

weren't doing a good job.
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

They gave him a very vague answer.
That's right.

So he did not have a right to find out

the real reason.
MR. RICHLAND;

MR, RICHLAND:

Well, of course, you don’t tell him,

except that you tell him he was unsatisfactorythe details are, of course you don't tell him.

Now, what
You tell

him it was unsatisfactory.
QUESTION:

But that doesn't respond to the Chief

Justice's question is, what is his protection against the
possibility that you relied on a false, inaccurate, slancerous
statement of soma kind?
HR. RICHLAND:

He has none,,as I understand it.
Well, that really isn't so.

he has a right to challenge his dismissal.

Because

And in Article 78,

we see that our courts are as open a s any courts in the land
to civil servants.

They are the most litigating people in

the world.
QUESTION:

Did he have a statutory right to some kind
t

of hearing before his dismissal?
MR. RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

Nope.

Well, then, what, is the right you’re

describing?
MR. RICHLAND:

No, but he had a statutory right to

review his dismissal in the event his dismissal was for
unconstitutional reasons.
QUESTION:

Well, how does he know?

MR. RICHLAND:

He cannot be dismissed because his is black,

or because he was a Jew, or for any other of those reasons
that are not permitted under our constitution.
he can get relief in our own courts.

And for that

And to the extent — in

addition to that — that the reasons asserted for his dis­
missal were disgraceful or unpleasant or libelous, he has his
right of action in slander.
QUESTION:

The privilege you referred to a moment

ago, Mr, Richland, that an employer has when communicating
information to a

from a former employer receiving — is

that any different for a government employer than it is for
a private employer under the law of the State of New York.

20

In a defamation case.
MR. RICHLAND:

No difference.

There is no difference.

Our files are even more open that the files of private firms.
QUESTION:

Nelly I was talking about the privilege

that could be claimed in a defamation.
MR. RICHLAND:
anyone is suggesting

Oh, certainly not.

I don't think

that an orderly employes who holds his

job in private industry at will cannot be dismissed for any
reason at ally except a reason which, of course, insults the
constitution.
QUESTION:

Well, no, what I’m talking about

is, supposing that an employee brings an action for
defamation, of slander, against a former employer for divulging
the reasons for which that employer was discharged.

Now you

said earlier that there was a privilege under New York law,
apparently a qualified privilege, that can be asserted in
effect passing along a recommendation.

And my question is,

is that any different — is the privilege any different
for a governmental employer than it is for a private employer?
MR.RICHLAND:
QUESTION:

I submit that it should not be.

Well, I ask you: do you know whether it

is.
MR. RICHLAND:

I submit that it isn’t.

QUESTION:

Oh.

QUESTION:

What is the relief that you understand

21

that the 2nd Circuit opinion has given —
MR. RICHLAND:

I can only take the interpretation

that is provided in the respondent's brief.

And that is,

reinstatement with full pay and counsel fee.
QUESTION:

I can understand none of it, your

Well, you got 800 lawyers.

MR. RICHLAND:

We cannot take care of the counsel

fees of our adversary, and they do become a very serious
problem.
QUESTION:

I just found glancing through the record

that there is a mention about the Plainfield, New Jersey job
that he was denied.
MR. RICHLAND:

That's right.

Rut there was nothing

in there that shows that he —
QUESTION:

But before you and I get to arguing

about what’s in there, let’s read it, rather than interpret

would be three weeks if the investigation was successfully

But I was never called back, never called down

success in the future, and I suggest that that does not raise
to the level of proof of any such thing.

I don't think that he takes that position.

But that is what the law of this New York State is,

that a

his probationary period.
QUESTION:

Well, I’ll certainly ask your adversary.

But if he were to concede this, then 'I winder where this

extension of what was said in the opinions of this Court
rather than what was decided in the opinions of this Court.
I might suggest that the decisions of this Court, particularly
Bishop and Paul, preclude anything but a reversal in this
case, unless stare decisis lasts less than a vear.
Unless there are any further questions, I would
like to reserve a few minutes for any reply that I think
might be necessary.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RESNICOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

MR. RESNICOFF:
QUESTION:

They said, you’re not entitled to it.

Did you follow up in any way with asking

the judge for more complete answers?
MR. RESNICOFF:

No.

Because you would have been entitled to

it, I think.
MR. RESNICOFF:
and that was that.

We asked for it, they gave us that,

We pointed that

Gurfein and before Judge Nerker.
QUESTION:

But you did make no further attempt to

find out —
MR. RESNICOFF:

No, I did not.

Judge Clark, during

the course of the oral argument — my vouna friend here,
Mr. Richland, did not argue

in the Court of Appeals.

A woman argued the appeal there, and Mr. Justice
Clark asked the woman, supposing in that letter, which concededly
was untruthful — concededly -— that that was not a correct
letter that should have gone out, because his services
were satisfactory.

30

QUESTION:

Which letter are you now referring to?

You say the letter —
MR. RESNICOFP:

Clark said —
QUESTION:

Nov/, wait a minute, you characterized

that as an untruthful letter?
HR, RESNICOFP:

Well, in the sense that his ser­

vices as an employee were satisfactory, there was no question.
He had never been served with any charges, he had never been
found guilty of anything other than this one incident which
allegedly took place in the police academy.

Other than that,

there was nothing — nothing of anything derogatory about
tills man.
QUESTION:

Well, how can you know that?

MR. RESNICOFP:
QUESTION:

Well, there was nothing in the record

Well, was a probationary employee — does

it have to be in the record?
MR. RESNICOFF:

Well, normally, a man serving his

probation in the police department, they serve him with
charges, they have hearings there in the police department.
They have hearings, they give a man hearings in the police
department.
QUESTION:

Well, then you're saying it’s New York

practice that unless there's been a hearing for a probationary

31
employee, the supervisor could not respond to a request such
as this, telling an employee had been discharged because
his services were unsatisfactory?
HR. RRSNICOFF:

They have never — and in mv vast

experience that I've had with the police department in the
City, they have never indicated to a man, other than the
standard letter which goes out which says your services have
been found to be unsatisfactory, as far as the police
department, that is the end of the matter.
QUESTION:

So this is a standard letter, then?

MR. RESNICGFF:
right.

This is a standard letter, that's

MR. RSSHICGFF:

Well, as long as there was a

was incumbent upon them at least to come forward with at
least some evidence, or at least make an offer of proof
that what they allege, or what appears to be in some record
of some kind, actually happened»
QUESTION:

We didn't know what it was.

You thought one of the issues in this

federal court case, then, was for them to prove the reasons
why they did discharge him.
.MR. RESNICOFF;

I wanted to know why.

And I said

that this man was entitled under the decisions of this
Court, in the Roth case, in the Sinderman case, before
Bishop, that since there was a stigma, that he was entitled
to a hearing, a hearing at the agency level before dismissal.

33

I don't take the position, and my colleagues and
I don’t take the position, that a man serving a probationary
period is entitled, as a matter of course, to a hearing,
We’re not asking your honors to do that.
with that.

We’re not concerned

That issue is not in this case.

But we say that

in this case, and in the Bishop case—-Judge Stevens, you
wrote the decision, Judge Rehnquist, you wrote a dissenting
opinion—the issue in this type of a case, Judge Marshall is
very much concerned with this stigma that attaches to a
young man.

How can you put a label

like that on a

man without giving him notice and an opportunity to rebut?
This man can’t be a lawyer, he’s trained, he wants to be a
law enforcement officer.
QUESTIOTI:

Mr. Resnicoff, in your vast experience

with the police department, as you characterised it a
moment ago, can you think of any reason for discharging a
probationary employee which would not be some sort of stiqma
in the v/ay you’re describing it now?
MR. RESNICOFF:

I

If he doesn’t perform satisfactorily,

QUESTION:

Well, aren’t those stigmas?

MR. RESNICOFF:

No, I don’t think that’s a stigma.

QUESTION: How doss one draw the line between a stigma
and a non-stigma?
HR. RESNICOFF:

Well, it’s a little difficult, judge,

34

to lay down a definitive rule.

But I think, as Judge Clark,

in this luminous opinion of his — and incidentally, I say —

QUESTION:
about that.

Mr. Resnicoff, let me ask you a question .

Supposing the file showed — nobody knows what

it shows, because nobody seems to want to get it into the
record.

But suppose the file showed that he was in fact

terminated because he was late to work, or something like
that.

But it also shotted that there was this incident in the

police academy where he allegedly put a gun to his head, in an
apparent suicide attempt.

But it doesn't indicate that the

police department relied on that as a cause for discharge.
Would your case be any different?
MR. RESNIC0FF:

Well, of course there you've got

a combination of stigmatizing material, and other material
that is not stigmatizing material.

livelihood, there I think he’s entitled to soma kind of a

QUESTION:

of sealing all personnel files and not making them available
to anyone under any circumstances.

That's right.

And then the Court of Appeals

for the

2nd Circuit reversed that judgement of dismissal.
MR. RESNICOFF:

Unanimously reversed, right.

And in your amended complaint, you ask

for a variety of different kinds of relief, including among
others, reinstatement and monetary damages.

Or put it this way, let's say we affirm the Court

MR. RESNICOFF:

Now what will happen?

I would have moved for reinstatement..

Well, I'll tell you now, the answer is

If you're going to say that automatically you're going

45
get the $50,000, if you say, automatically, you5re going to
get $50,000.
MR.- RESNICOFF:

If you say no, it’s no.

I think

what has happened to this man, believe me when I say —
QUESTIONS

So you8re scared of me too.

You're

scared of everybody.
MR. RESNICOFF;

Let me say this, Judge.

When Judge

Clark wrote that decision, everybody newspaper in the country
took it up.
79

All civil service papers commented.

It was a

very favorable -- it was well received,
Because they felt that most people in civil service, when you
reach something like that, you’re going to throw him out and
give him a label the restof his life, the least you can do is
Good God, give him a chance to
QUESTION:

Well, may

be heard.
we

come back to my question

because I am puzzled.
The Court of Appeals opinion didn't indicate what,
if any relief, should be considered by the trial court, did
it?
MR. RESNICOFF:
QUESTION:

No.

Jmd the trial court, of course, didn’t,

because it dismissed the complaint.
MR. RESNICOFF:
QUESTION:

Correct?

Right.

And among ether prayers, in your amended

complaint, is one for reinstatement.

Now, why

should the

46

City of New York be required to reinstate an employee that
it had a complete right to terminate with or without any
reason whatsoever?

Why should it be saddled now with

employi.ng a probationary employee, perhaps for the rest of
his occupational life, that it had a complete right to
terminate, with or without a reason?
QUESTION;

Nov?, this is the question I asked your

opposition *
QUESTION:

Yes.

.

QUESTION;

And regard me as asking it

"V

with Mr.

Justice Stewart.
MR. RESHICOFF;
will ask that of me.

Yes, 1 know.

You said you certainly

~-

All right, now, let me say this, to the first
question that was made, the first statement.

I have submitted

a judgement to Judge Worker based on the reversal mandate of
the U.S. Court of Appeals, and an affidavit had been
submitted in opposition, which is now pending before Judge
Werker, to hold it in abeyance because they have indicated that
a petition for certiorari was being submitted„ 'Soothe judgement
which I had submitted, which was requesting reinstatement,
in answer to your honor's question and VMr. Chief
Justice, I
*
was

asking for reinstatement and for the monetary relief.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. RESNICOFF:
here.

So that's pending whatever happens

47
Now, I am not in the'position to concede, as a
matter of law, that a man serving a probationary period can
serve at the mere — as my adversary says, at the mere whim or
at the mere sufferance, and arbitrarily can be terminated.
I don't say that.
QUESTION:

Then, he can go into the state courts.
That's what the District Court held in

this Cease, that that was the term of his employment, that it
was employment at will, at the will of the employer, and
that finding was not disturbed by the Coux’t of Appeals.

So

presumably we accept that here.
MR. RESNIGOFF:

All right, you accept it.

Then I

won't quarrel with that.
QUESTIONS

Correct, all right.

MR. RESNIGOFF;

I won't quarrel with that.

But

I say in this case we're not concerned with the arbitrariness,
we're concerned with the inegalifcy and the unconstitutionality
of what happened here.

In other words, a deprivation of this

man's constitutional rights, and it was contrary to federal
decisional law; that this man has been stigmatised under these
circumstances, and he is entitled to notice, and that comes
within the panoply of due process.
QUESTION;

All right, let's assume we accept all

of that, and affirm the judgement of the Court of Appeals.
Why is he entitled to reinstatement, that's my question?
MR. RESNIGOFF:

Because he was improperly removed.

43
That's why he’d be entitled to reinstatement.
QUESTION;

Then you're saying he has a property

interest in a probationary job.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HESNICQFF;

Once —* that's right., if they acted

illegally* and in violation of his constitutional rights* and
summarily removed him without due process* that is correct,
they should then pay for their mistake»

This man. has been

hurt in the community.
QUESTION;

Paying for their mistake is one thing,

reinstating him is something else, reinstating an employee
that they terminated, and that they had a perfect rightfco
terminate, with or without a cause.
MR. RESNICOFF:

If your honors -- let me say this,

if your honors after deliberation should fael that this man
should be reinstated and should be given a hearing on that
particular issue, of course, there’s nothing for me to do but
accept it.

And we will need that at the proper time if

that's raised.

They can't meet that.

They can't possibly

substantiate something like that.
But in any event, if this is what your honors
feel, all right, let’s reinstate him and give him a hearing
on that point.

And if it’s substantiated, then all right.

QUESTION;

Well, it's quite possible to read Roth

and Perry as not having anything to do wi ;h reinstatement

40

when you're talking about stigmatization, that he's simply
entitled to a hearing, and then he's fired, and you get the
hearing.

But he doesn't get reinstatement.
MR. RESNICOFF:

Well, the only thing is this, the

only thing is this: if the Court should remand, without
reinstating — exactly he's not within their jurisdiction —
supposing he doesn’t show up?

Who are they going to try?

They got to put a man on trial who's a patrolman, as a
probationary -QUESTION:

Well, he would have the opportunity for

a hearing.
MR. RESNICOFF:

Well, if your honors should feel that

that is the way out, I'm not going to — we'll meet it, if your
honors should feel it should go back for a pre-hearing and
not a post-hearing, well, —
QUESTION:

You can’t go back for a pre-hearing

after the event has occurred.
MR. RESNICOFF:

Well, then, you're talking about a
*

hearing now.

Going back for a hearing.

This is something

they should have given him before they dismissed him.
QUESTION:

Well, if they give him the hearing now,

you might have to — perhaps be entitled to have the record
expunged from this stigma that you described.

Would that

take care of your problem?
MR, RESNICOFF:

It might, it might,

Let me just

50

say this in conclusion —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hake it very brief, if

you will*
MR. RESNXCOFF:

Yes.

I just want to say this, that I’m not -—■ of course
their position is that this is a very important case, it's
going to have an impact, this that and the other thing.
we don't think so at all.

And

We're interested in this

particular case, and the stigma that arose here.

And I say

that a pronouncement by this Court on the stigma — because
in Bishop it was left open —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, you've covered

that already, counsel.
Do you have any further comments?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. BERNARD RICHLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. RICHLAND:

I think I had jus; three very brief

comments that I think are essential.
In the first place. Chief Justice, I assure you that
a New York City policeman found drunk on his post would be
fired.
Second, my friend suggests that ihe first time we
heard that there was discreditable material in Mr. Velger's
record was when a witness took the stand. But if you will
look at page 53a, paragraph 18

of the amended complaints •—

51
and I will read it to you — it says, the action on the
part of the police department employees by inserting
derogatory matter, comments and remarks in plaintiff's
personnel folder without affording him an opportunity to
see, inspect and reply, damaged his standing in the community
and foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other
employment opportunities.
Third, in response to Justice Powell's question, or
suggestion, as to the sealing of records, total sealing of all
personnel records of terminated prohationaries, or terminated
non-tenured employees.

That, X submit, would redound to the

disfavor of persons who were terminated for perfectly benign
reasons related to their capacity in particular respect to
aspects of their job that didn't in the least stigmatise
them.

Like for instance a policeman who was found to be

too compassionate, or kindly disposed.

Or to an assistant

corporation counsel who seamed somewhat sluggish at the time.
Or who didn’t fit

somebody's personal predilections, or in

the case of a confidential clerk in this Court, that he was
sluggish.
I suggest that a reversal is absolutely essential
in this case for the proper conduct of my government and, X
suggest, for the conduct of the government in this land.
And X thank you, your honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.

52
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:51 p.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.]
