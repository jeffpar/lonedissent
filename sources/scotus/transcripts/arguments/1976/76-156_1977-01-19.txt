ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL E, POLLOCK, S3Q.
ON BEHALF’ OP THE PETITIONER
MR. POLLOCK:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a preliminary injunction against
an on-going state court proceeding* but more specifically the
injunction enjoins a state court proceeding to collect final
state court judgments in the amount of $7? million, final
state court judgments resulting after ten years of litigation
in the Illinois courts, final judgments fully reviewed by the
Illinois Supreme Court and unanimously affirmed by that court
in a very thorough opinion by Judge Walter Schaefer, and
final judgments which this Court declined to review on petition
for certiorari.
Furthermore, the preliminary injunction was issued
by the District Court on precisely the same 'federal grounds
which the state defendants had specifically raised by formal
pleading in the state proceeding as a defense, a defense which
the state courts, indeed, the Illinois Appellate Court,
specifically ruled was within the jurisdiction of the Illinois
courts to adjudicate,

A defense, however, which when the case

4
was then remanded for trial on that defense in the state
trial court, the state defendants immediately before trial
moved to withdrav\? the Federal anti-trust defense — that was
in 1971 '— and never again reasserted that federal defense
in the state proceedinga
QUESTION:

There is no significance if they with­

drew it without prejudice?
MR. POLLOCK:

I don't think so, Your Honor*

Certainly not — that could have no effect on the

either

the Section 2283 question, which we are dealing with today,
or comity and federalism questions, because obviously any
litigant cannot determine for himself by removing a defense
or claim without prejudice whether that shall affect the
application of principles of comity and federalism.
I think that so far as this case is concerned,
regardless of what may have been the right of the state
defendants at some later date in the state proceeding to
again raise the Federal defense, the withdrawal of that
defense without prejudice in 1971 can have no effect, for the
reason that during the next four years of the state court
proceeding the state defendants never chose to reassert that
federal defense.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pollock, it was pending in the

federal court all this period, wasn't it?

For some time

prior to withdrawal, they had been asserting their Federal

antitrust theory, had they not?
MR, POLLOCK:

Yes, in a trouble-damage action

which is still pending and which, indeed, will be going to
trial«
QUESTION:

Which was more or less set on the back

burners -- a phrase we used to use -- while the state pro­
ceeding was completed, isn't that true?
MR. POLLOCK:

It was set on the back burner over

the objection of my client, Vendo,
We have set forth in a supplement to our brief,
supplement B, a full statement of the various continuances
obtained by the state defendants in the federal case with
respect to the trouble-damage claim,
I would also point out, Mr, Justice Btevens, that
throughout the ten-year period of the state court proceeding,
from 1965 to 1975) at no time was there ever any intimation
that at the conclusion of the state case the state defendants
in their federal case which they had filed after the state
proceeding was initiated

there was never any intimation that

the state defendants or the federal plaintiffs would ever seek
to enjoin- the results of the state litigation, but instead
every statement by the state defendants, or the federal
plaintiffs in the federal case was to the effect that if the
~~ if Vendo is successful in its state proceeding to recover
judgments as it did, then the state defendants would seek

6
damages —» would seek, damages bascsd in part on the state
court proceeding.
But not until January 1.975 was there ever the
slightest intimation, even one word in the record, about
obtaining a preliminary injunction against the state court
proceeding,
QUESTION:

They didn't need it until then, did

they?
You don't rely on this as a waiver.
They didn't have any need for an injunction as
long as they were willing to try out the state issues in the
state court,
MB, POLLOCK;
arguing waiver.

Mr, Justice Btevens, we are not

For example, we are not contending that the

federal plaintiffs are barred from proceeding with their
trouble-damage action,
QUESTION:

You are really just relying on the

anti--* in junction statute, as I understand it,
MR, POLLOCK:

We are relying on the anti-injunction

statute and, in addition, Your Honor, the principles of
comity and federalism, in this context where you have a
final state judgment,
QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is the issues would

be exactly the same if the problem arose ten years ago instead
of today

the legal issues.

7
MR. POLLOCK:

With respect to Section 2283* I think

that is correct, but the additional issues presented in our
petition relating to the application of fundamental principles
of federal-state relations are affected very substantially
by the fact that here you have state court defendants who
specifically raised a federal defense and then went all the
way up to the Illinois Appellate Court, insisting that they
had the right to have the state court determine that issue.
They persuaded the Illinois Appellate Court that
they did -- that the Illinois courts did have jurisdiction.
Having persuaded the Illinois courts that the
Illinois courts had such jurisdiction -- and that opinion
of the Illinois Appellate Court is at pages 77 to 79 of the
Appendix -- when the case was remanded for trial, so that
they could have the opportunity that they pleaded they wanted
to have —
QUESTION:

They then decided they would rather

try those issues In the federal court.
MR. POLLOCK:

That’s right, and withdrew the

federal defense, and for the next four years
years of this marathon ten-year proceeding

the last four
there was never

any reference on their part to the federal defense.
What they did was take the federal defense., stick
it in their back pocket where it could be used possibly at
a later date in the event the judgment was entered against

8
them.
And we say the circumstances here, the withdrawal
of the defense and the failure to reassert it and, in
addition, the clear entitlement of these judgments to full
faith and credit and, in addition, the basic principles set
forth perhaps most clearly in this Court's decision in the
Rooker case, that state court litigants cannot obtain re»
hearing or appeal by going to a federal district court as
distinguished from -•*
QUESTION:

I don't understand them to be seeking

any rehearing or appeal of any state issue decided in the
state proceeding.

They are claiming that this whole thing

is illegal as a matter of federal law.
But that's not a review of the state -- Is that a
review of any issue decided by the state court?
MR. POLLOCK:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, in the sense

that what they have done is to nullify -»
QUESTION:

The total result.

MR. POLLOCK:

I understand that.

■— the total result.

And not only to

nullify the state judgment, not only to nullify the pending
state proceedings in the Illinois trial court, supplementary
proceedings which had been initiated before the motion for
Injunction was filed to enforce the judgments, but they have
nullified to that extent these fundamental policies of the
State of Illinois concerning the fiduciary duties of corporate

9
officers and directors.
Now -QUESTION:

Suppose it is true that the defendant

in the state suit, your opponents, could not have gotten any
relief, antitrust relief, in the state court.

There might

have been a defense but they could not have gotten a judgment.
MR. POLLOCK:

It is for that reason, Your Honor,

that we are not saying that they are precluded -QUESTION:

Yes or no? That's true, isn't it?

MR. POLLOCK:

The relief -— You are right.

They

could not have obtained a -QUESTION;

Let's suppose that in the --

MR. POLLOCK:

-- The relief they could have

obtained, Your Honor, would be to prevent the judgment -QUESTION:

I understand that.

I understand that.

Now, how about in the federal court?

When was the

federal suit filed?
MR, POLLOCK:

The federal suit was filed two months

after the state proceeding was filed in 1965,
QUESTION:

Did the federal judge, in that suit,

indicate that he wouldn't go ahead as long as the federal
defense was pending in the state court?
MR. POLLOCK:
who were involved.
the case proceed.

No,

There were several federal judges

One of the federal judges insisted that
Counsel for the federal plaintiffs urged

10

the federal court, pleaded with the federal court, to defer
any action In the federal case until the state court proceeding
had been concluded.

And, at least on two occasions as set

forth verbatim -QUESTION:

The federal plaintiff urged the federal

court judge.
MRn POLLOCK;

Yes, as set forth in Supplement B

to our brief, where we quote exactly what transpired with
these various status reports.
On at least two occasions, counsel for Vendo
protested the delay of the trouble-damage case and urged the
court to go ahead.
In those instances, at that time, the federal judge
accepted the entreaties of the federal plaintiff to defer any
action, in large part» on the theory that -- in fact, at one
point, on the ground that the federal antitrust defense
would be adjudicated in the state courts.
Almost within the following few months counsel for
the federal plaintiff went into the state court and withdrew
that defense so that it could never be -QUESTION;

I suppose he did have a choice between

there was a choice to be made as to whether to submit the
antitrust defense in the state court or not, because if it
were decided against him there he could never have any relief
only in the federal court and the federal court was

11

MR, POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

No, no,

I think that is incorrect,

No collateral estoppel?

MR* POLLOCK;

There would be a collateral estoppel

effect with respect to issues which were actually litigated
there,
QUESTION;

Yes,

MR, POLLOCK:

There would not be a res judicata

effect with respect to the claim of the federal plaintiff
under the federal trouble-damage actions,
A number of decisions have pointed out the
significant difference,
QUESTION:

I don't think there -would be any res

judicata, but there would be collateral estoppel,
MR, POLLOCK.:

There would be collateral estoppel.

The decision «•QUESTION:

And those issues could not be retried in

the federal courts.
MR, POLLOCK:

That's right,

VJe are not suggesting

now that in the trouble damage case which is proceeding
ahead in the district court that there is a res judicata bar,
nor can there be a collateral estoppel bar with respect to
issues directly concerning the federal antitrust defense,
since that was withdrawn,
So they are free to proceed and they have assured
the district court, even just within the last month., that

12

they — that regardless of what this Court decides with
respect to the injunction, that they are proceeding ahead with
their trouble-damage action.
As I have indicated, we don't believe that there is,
either an appropriate res judicata bar to their doing so,
nor do we think there can be a collateral estoppel issue
except as to matters which were actually litigated,
QUESTIONi

Nothing was litigated there with respect

to an antitrust defense because it was withdrawn,
MR, POLLOCK:

The problem there, Your Honor, is

that ——
QUESTION:

Some of the facts on your affirmative

case are the same ones involved in the antitrust —
MR, POLLOCK:

That's not quite accurate for the

reason that as their amended complaint shows
filed in January of 1975

which they

many of their allegations con­

cerning alleged improper conduct on the part of Vendo,con»
eerning various pleadings which Vendo filed in the state
proceeding, claimed bad faith, for example, that at one point
in the litigation there was a trade secret theory which was
rejected by the Illinois courts.
So that, to that extent, on the basis of their
very complaint which goes into almost archeological detail
concerning the state proceeding, they have made much of the
state proceeding an Integral part of the federal case.

13

This is not. I would point out to Mr. Justice
Stevens, in further answer to his question earlier, that this
is not a case in which a federal action is alleged to be,
say, one part of a sweeping panorama which might be appropriate
for ~~ as evidence in a large scale antitrust case.
If one looks at the allegations of the amended
complaint filed by these gentlemen in January 1975, you will
find an almost item by item objection to certain decisions
which were made by the state courts in the state proceeding
and conduct of the -- with respect to the filing of pleadings,
the making of arguments, the timing of motions, in the state
proceeding.
QUESTION;

May I ask you:

Would you be here making

the same argument if there had never been any antitrust
defense filed and withdrawn?
MR. POLLOCK:

I would be making the Section 2233

argument which, of course, is an absolute and categorical
prohibition.
We still would have that problem because, as this
Court has repeatedly ~~
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be arguing that he should

have, and didn't, present his antitrust defense in the state
c ourt?

V

MR. POLLOCK:

No, Your Honor.

My argument would have to be more limited.

That's

14
why this case is an extreme case, calling for, 1 believe,
appropriate relief from this Court»
QUESTION:

And if there had been no antitrust,

defense filed and none withdrawn and then he went to court
alleging that the state proceeding, in itself, and the
collection of the judgment would violate the antitrust laws,
you ’would be back to 2283 argument?
MR® POLLOCK:

We would be back on 2283.* Your Honor,

and you would have a more difficult

comity federalism issue

because then you would have the situation where a defense
had actually been presented and presumably rejected if the
judgments were, nevertheless, entered.
It would be a more difficult case.
But, in the situation here, given the finality of
the judgment, the deliberate rejection -- not a failure to
avail themselves of a federal defense, but the deliberate
rejection of a full and fair opportunity to have this
adjudicated — this case is really beyond the pale.
■QUESTION:

Let me get it clear.

Suppose no antitrust defense in the state court
and then withdrawn and the federal antitrust suit filed,
would you make a motion in that federal antitrust case for
the federal court to hold its hand or to abstain and let the
federal defenses be presented in the state court?
MR9 POLLOCK:

No, Your Honor, I would not.

15
QUESTION;

You are not saying it's again

would

be any Younger situation at all?
MR, POLLOCK:

I would not, Your Honor, urge the

stay of the federal ease and, indeed, at least two circuits,
the Second Circuit in the Lyons ease and the Ninth Circuit
in Mach-Tronlcs, have held that in such circumstances
trouble “damage action in the federal court should net be
stayed,
That is not our argument.
I would point out that in the Lyons, case, at the
same time that Judge Hand held that a stay of the federal
ease was inappropriate, that in that same case xvhere an
attempt was made to enjoin the state judgment, the Second
Circuit held no, that was entirely improper.

They held it

was barred by Section 2283»
QUESTION:

Thank you,

MR, POLLOCK:

Now, just so that we understand what

the factual situation is, during the period 1959 to 1964,
Mr, Harry Stoner was both a director and officer of Vendo,
receiving a salary of $50,000 a year.
The Illinois Supreme Court held that at that very
time, while he was on the payroll of Vendo, serving as a
director and officer, that Stoner had violated his fiduciary
duties through misconduct of the most flagrant sort, by
secretly organizing and financing another vending machine

16

manufacturer, by secretly developing a new type of machine
which Vendo itself had been vainly trying to develop, by
deceitfully misrepresenting Stoner's relationship with the
new company and by misappropriating a corporate opportunity
rightfully belonging to Vendo»
The Illinois Supreme Court, in its opinion by
Judge Schaefer,

affirmed the judgments on the basis of those

violations of fiduciary duties quite apart, it should be
noted, quite apart,and regardless of, the court said, of any
liability that might be imposed, based on the non-competition
covenants.
After the Illinois Supreme Court denied rehearing,
this Court denied certiorari in 1975.
N.ow, in 1975j these judgments were clearly final.
They clearly were entitled to full faith and credit, and
they were, if anything, overripe for collection.
Toward that end, Vendo had commenced supplementary
proceedings in the state court to collect these judgments.
Now, in an effort to stop those proceedings, the
state defendants sought stays from the Illinois Supreme Court,
the Illinois Trial Court, the Illinois Appellate Court, and
then, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as Circuit Justice.
All these stays were denied.

Then, at that point,

the state defendants turned to the federal district court
and obtained the preliminary injunction here in issue.

u
The injunction prohibits taking any further steps
to enforce or collect or attempt to enforce or collect the
final state judgments, and it specifically refers to these
supplementary proceedings pending in the state courts.
The preliminary injunction was sought on two
grounds.

One ground was that the respondent had allegedly

been denied due process in the state proceeding.

The other,

as I mentioned, was this antitrust issue which had been
specifically raised in the state court, specifically held
by the Illinois courts to be within their jurisdiction, and
then, specifically, withdrawn before trial by the state
defendants„
In its decision, the district court held that it
lacked jurisdiction to consider the due process issue on the
ground that only this Court has jurisdiction to review a final
stay judgment.
Nevertheless, the district court granted the in­
junction on the antitrust claim on the ground that the
Illinois Supreme Court had not passed on the antitrust issue,
notwithstanding the fact that the only reason the Illinois
supreme Court had not passed on the issue was because the
state defendants had deliberately withdrawn that issue and
refused to reassert it at any time thereafter.
Now, 1 have emphasized very briefly, if it please
the Court, what I think the principal issues are, and xve have

canvased those, issues in our brief,
I would like to briefly state, so that there can
be no confusion on this — I would like to briefly state what
I think are not the issues that are presented here.
To begin with, there is no issue here as to personal
liberty or civil rights.

There is no issue as to the juris­

diction of the state courts to enter the judgments in ques­
tion,

There can be no issue as to due process or the fair­

ness of the state proceeding*

In fact, the district judge

so held.
There can be no issue as to the constitutionality
of the Illinois common lav; concerning the fiduciary duties of
corporate directors and officers.
There can be no doubt as to ritoner's guilt of the
most egregious violations of those rules.
There can be no issue as to the meritorious nature
of Vendo’s c la ins in the state proceeding,
baseless or sham about those claims.

There is nothing

All five courts in the

Illinois system that dealt with this upheld the guilt,
QUESTION:

Mr, Pollock, isn't it also equally true

that there is no issue before us as to the validity of the
district courtfs finding that there is a probability of
success for your opponents on the antitrust issues?
MR» POLLOCK:

I think that is correct, Your Honorg

the only reason being that it seemed to me, as an advocate,

19

appropriate that vie narrow the issues -~
QUESTION:

I understand your tactics and it makes

a lot of sense, but I just want to be clear.
MR* POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

But vie do not in the slightest —

You don't admit your truth, or anything

like that.
MR* POLLOCK:

No.

And furthermore, as we point out in our reply
brief, the district court issued this caveat in its opinion.
The court said the findings here are interlocutory in nature,
based on incomplete records and, of course, a complete trial
directed to the issues might produce evidence requiring a
different or more limited result.
QUESTION:

But vie just don*t need to get into that

in order to reach the issues you do want us to decide.
MR. POLLOCK:

Absolutely correct, Your Honor,

There can also be no question of the opportunity
provided by the Illinois state courts for adjudication of the
federal antitrust defense, and there can be no question that
the state defendants deliberately rejected that opportunity.
QUESTION:

It sounds as though the submission of

the defense, and then its withdrawal after the appeal, is a
rather critical part of your case, !
MR. POLLOCK:
issues.

Only with respect to the non~2283

We don't even think you have to reach that, Your

20

Honor, because this injunction, we think, is clearly barred
by Section 2283*

It does not fall within the expressly

authorized exception or the innative jurisdiction and,
Indeed, as we argue in our brief, the —
QUESTION:

But, aside from 2283,* though, again assume

there had been no filing of the defense and no withdrawal^
and then after the judgment was entered, this district court
did exactly what it did here?

You wouldn’t say it didn’t

have jurisdiction to do it or that it was a violation of
Younger.v, Harris, or anything like that,

You would just

say that 2283 would be your only point»
MR, POLLOCK:

I think that is right, Your Honor,

except that, in the context of 1983 actions and habeas corpus
actions, questions under comity in federalism may arise
where there has been an adjudication in the sta^te courts of
a federal defense, but we don’t have to get into that,
QUESTION:

I agree.

But if there hadn’t been the filing and the
withdrawal, 2283 would be your sole point,
MR. POLLOCK:

And the final judgment, yes.

Now, I would just conclude by stating — leaving
some time for rebuttal — that for nearly two years this
injunction has not only nullified a decision of the Illinois
Supreme Court and nullified the state proceedings to enforce
that judgment in the Illinois trial court, but it has, I

21

repeat, nullified to that extent these important state
policies with respect to fiduciary conduct»
As a result -~
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are well into your

rebuttal time, Mr* Pollock*
MR» POLLOCK:

I would just say, finally, Your

Honor, that what ~~ as a result of what has happened here,
the respondents have managed so far to avoid their adjudicated
liability for incontestable violations of state law duties*
Thank you*
QUESTION:

Mr* Pollock, let me ask you a question

on the Court's time, if I may,
MR. POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

Of course,

Do you make any claim here that because

of the final nature of the judgment of the Illinois court,
the federal courts are required to accord full faith and
credit to it?
MR» POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, precisely,

Now that's different than a 2283 claim,

isn't it?
MR, POLLOCK:

Yes,

It is based, instead, on the

governing Statute 1738 of the Judicial Code,
We know of no reason why, in fact, this whole case
could not be disposed of on the basis of full faith and
credit,

22

I am utterly unaware

and certainly the respon­

dents1 brief does not help us in this regard -- I am utterly
unaware of any reason why this, why the full faith and
credit statute is not completely dispositive here.

I know of

no exception to the applicability of full faith and credit
here.
QUESTION:

And that would apply even if the

Clayton Act is an exception to 2283* wouldn't it, because
of the finality of the state court -MR. POLLCCK:

Absolutely.

It would not even be

necessary to reach the questions cf 2283 or comity of
federalism, the -QUESTION:

Mr. Pollock, doesn't the full faith and

credit clause only apply to the state?
MR. POLLOCK:
QUESTION:

Oh, no.

It is the statute you are talking

about.
MR, POLLOCK:

Section 1738 of the Judicial Code

specifically provides that federal courts shall give full
faith and credit to state court judgments in precisely the
same way that other state courts shall.
And there has been no indication, so far as we are
aware, of any conceivable

exception to the full faith and

c r edifc requirement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARNABAS F, SEARS, ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SEARS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
If you will pardon me a moment -~
There are a few matters that I would like to get
clarified, having listened to the argument, of my distinguished
friend.

And one was his representation that just last ~~ a

few months ago, before His Honor Judge Will, that we had
admitted before him that regardless of what this Court
decides, it doesn't make any difference.
Now, for some reason or other, he left out a very
important passage that appeared in the transcript of the case.
I have the transcript here, and what he left out was the
statement that I made immediately following the statement
that Mr. Baker said, "That's right," I said, "they do.

They

say they are not trying to interfere with the prosecution of
this case.

All they are doing is trying to keep us from

getting an injunction to keep this case alive*
amounts to."

•

•-

urn"...

That's all it

c

And I have some question with respect to — with
all deference again to my distinguished friend -- the
propriety of quoting a record like that.
Now, they've got two supplements in this replybrief of theirs.

One is Supplement A, which is the statement

24

of Bfconerss given to the Commission.
I-.ts Honor Juoge McLaren»
of something.

All that was before

That is supposed to be dispositive

I don't know what, but it was ail before

Judge McLaren:
Now* Supplement B is a supplement to their reply
brief the thrust of which is that we thwarted the prosecution
of this case by our dilatory tactics.
Now* we had in our brief what His Honor Judge
McLaren said and what they assured the court* and we had
before the Circuit Court of Appeals a supplement* and I have
it here* which sets forth the entire history of the case.
Now* If they desired a supplement to their reply
brief* it certainly seems to me that they should have appended
the supplement that we appended.

And what do we find in that

supplement* if the Court will pardon me for reading it?
Now* this is Mr. Ochsenschlager’s statement to the
trial court on February 10* 1971:
tried as soon as possible.

,!We do want to get it

There is a federal case that they

seem to be able to move ahead on.

I realize it is a motion.

It isn't like a trial* but they have a crew.
is handling it.

That one firm

It seems like they are all in it of record*

but they are able to move ahead on that* but not this one."
Now, again* with all deference* it seems to me
perfectly obvious that what His Honor Judge McLaren" said.
in this record* with respect to the fact that the parties had

25
agreed that the federal ease would await the final determina­
tion of the state proceedings, and that was evidenced by the
proceedings before him.

They agreed to a standby order so he

could pass upon the propriety of our application for a pre­
liminary injunction»
QUESTION:

If I understand your opponent,

Mr. Sears, it was at your suggestion that the judge thought
the federal case ought to await the outcome of the state case*
MR„ SEARS:

I think it was in part, Your Honor*

I believe that's correct, and the parties agreed to it*

I

think that's correct*
But, however one states the case, in its present
frame of reference,the bald fac/c is that petitioner is
claiming the fruits of a successful consummation of an
illegal objective*
This would seem startling enough were this purely
private litigation, but it is not.

It is litigation so

deeply impressed with the public interest in the enforcement
of the Sherman Act that private persons are endowed with de
facto official powers as private attorneys general to insure
the enforcement of that salutary and overriding public federal
policy so vital to the economic welfare of the Republic.
In. its present’ frame of reference, the question is
whether the federal antitrust laws can be enforced against a
Sherman Act violator

26
I say the present frame
QUESTION:

We11, your suit can go right ahead,

Mr* Sears *
MR* SEARS:
QUESTION:
MR*'SEARS:

I beg your pardon*
Your suit can go right ahead, can't it?
Well, it can go right ahead without the

benefit of a preliminary Injunction which, if we don't get.,
it, will completely destroy it*
QUESTION:

It will completely —

But If the state court judgment is

enforced, the federal plaintiff will be without resources to
carry it out; is that it?
MR, sEARo:

Well, as a matter of fact, two of the

federal plaintiffs, Lektro-Vend Corporation and Stoner
\

Investments, who have separate and distinct claims under the
Sherman Act, will be completely denied a federal courtroom*
I can't express It any better than His Honor Judge
McLaren ^expressed It in his opinion.
Now, with respect to the third claim, he found that
Stoner, himself, would be severely crippled in the prosecution
of the case- and, therefore, he held with respect to the
question,there was no case or controversy if that occurred,
and it was necessary —■
QUESTION:

Well, what if the judgment -- What if

the state court judgment was -- against your client was on
some completely unrelated matter and it was a very large

2?

judgment and if it 'was collected your clients would be wiped
out and couldn't go forward in federal court?

That would be

no excuse for an injunction, 1 don't suppose, vjould it?
MRY SEARS:
QUESTION*.

I don't think it would.
But it is critical for you to say that

the state suit itself and the collection of the judgment is
part of the antitrust violation.
t

MR0 SEARS:

Exactly.

That's precisely what the

court found.
QUESTION:

Nell, now, was it or was it not an

alternate ground in the state court that your clients were -»
wholly aside from the contract, wholly aside from the nocompetition agreement ivere violating their-fiduciary
obligations?
MR * SEARS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is that a completely separate alternate

ground In the state court?
MR* SEARS:

Well, it is the separate, completely

alternate ground they refused.to pass on.

They held that

Stoner had violated his fiduciary duty and that he had
seized a corporate opportunity.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand.

I understand that.

Now, would you be here making the same argument if
there had never been a no-competition agreement?
MR. SEARd:

No, I wouldn’t, because the question

of the breach of the fiduciary duty, as Judge McLaren pointed
out in his opinion, was inextricably interwoven with the anti
competitive characters of the agreements that they sewed on
in the state court»
QUESTION:

And you say those are indivisible, so

there couldn’t be an alternate ground ~~
MR, SEARS:
QUESTION:
MR, SEARS:

That’s correct»
state ground,
If X understand Your Honor's inquiry,

that’s absolutely correct.

And that’s what McLaren held

because Stoner never would have become a director apart from
the covenants, and the evidence is replete with --the record
is replete with evidence indicating the intent of Vendo in
procuring those anti-competitive covenants,
One of the reasons why they made him a director, he
was to serve as a director without pay, and it is interesting
to know that we examined this record in this case.

Based -»

The court didn’t upset any ruling of Justice
Schaefer,

He examined those proceedings for the purpose of

determining whether or not Vendo prosecuted them as a part
of an anti-competitive scheme.
And when you examine the record, and we are not
seeking now to impeach that record in the slightest, but when
you do examine that record, you will find that the evidence
upon which he based

the record on which he based the

29

statement that Stoner violated his fiduciary duty because
Vendo didn't have a genuine opportunity to purchase the
Lektro-Vend machine, was completely without support in that
state court record.

That state court record didn't mention

at all the fact that Stoner had warned Vendo that their
failure to purchase the Lektro-Vend machine was a serious
mistake, and add to which in the record before Judge
McLaren,

when the federal depositions came in, it became

even more conclusive that at no time did Vendo ever want to
purchase the Lektro-Vend machine.

At all times, they thought

that Lektro-Vend machine was completely too expensive to
operate.
QUESTION:

I may be confused on one factual matter,

Mr. oears.
You said when he was director, without compensation,
were not some of these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty,
some that were found, events that occurred at a period when
he was receiving $50,000 as a consulting engineer or consul­
tant?
MR. SEARS:

Well, I made a mistake. Your Honor.

I should have said that he was to serve as the director
without additional compensation.

That8s what I should have

said,
QUESTION:
factor.

And his consulting fee was a separate

30

MR, SEARS:
anything,

Well, they never consulted him about

I mean it was a pure sham from the outset,
QUESTION:

But he was receiving $50,000.

MR, SEARS;

He was, indeed, Your Honor.

He was receiving $50,000 a year, but it was a pure
sham.
had.

And Judge McLaren, five days of hearing,, now,...we
We had the records of the two state trials and

examining that record carefully, Mr, Stoner was a witness;
Vendo had an opportunity to present whatever evidence they
desired to present,,

Examining that record, carefully

examining that record, he found that Section 1 was violated
by those non-competitive agreements.

Those contracts

violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and he found evidence
tending to show that they violated Section 2.
Now, there was plenty of evidence to support that.
My dear friend talks about a ten-»year marathon.
ten-year marathon, indeed.

We had a

We had the first case where they

served to enforce those covenants which violated the Sherman
Act, so they were engaging then in an illegal objective,
but we had more than that.

We had a claim asserted that

ofconer had stolen a trade secret belonging to Vendo, and the
appellate court reversed that on the ground that there
wasn't any evidence at all to support that charge.
And in the Statement of Facts that they give,that
particular finding they conveniently overlook, if I may be

31
permitted to say so.
So* that was part of the ten-year marathon.

And

so we continue with this ten-year marathon* and the second
time we are confronted with the proposition that he ivas
responsible for the fact that they didn't have that FIFO
machine,
Now* if there is anything more conclusive in this
record that there was absolutely no evidence upon which to
base that claim and that they knew or should have known*
certainly at the time they filed the lawsuit back in 1965»
whether that charge was true?

they should have asserted all

charges they had against him»
And* this evidence shows also that this isn't the
first time they used the judicial process for purposes other
than what I consider* at least* to be a legitimate purpose.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sears* could I interrupt for just

a moment?
Two questions.

It seems to me you are arguing* in

effect* that they did commit an antitrust violation.
I should observe that they did refer to the trade
secret claim in Footnote 7 to their brief.

They didn't

conveniently omit that.
But* the question I had is:

What is your theory of

what happens to the state court judgment if you win?
last point rested on full faith and credit.

Their

What will happen

32
to the state court judgment If you prevail in the antitrust
litigation?

Will It be collectible or not or will it be

multiplied by three and you get three times the value?
MR. SEARS;

Well, i don’t think it would be

collectible. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you say about this

statutory requirement of full faith and credit to the state
court judgment?
MR. SEARS;

Well, I say this about that.

Pull

faith and credit, I can’t say that any better than I think
Mr. Justice Stewart said it in a specially concurring
opinion in Younger.
They argue,. "It is difficult to conceive of a
state interest more significant than the jurisdiction of
its court, the finality and integrity of their judgments
and the enforcement of state law rules as to fiduciary
conduct»"
Now, sure, in a different context — and I am aware
of the fact that a word is not crystallelear and unchanged,
it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in
content and meaning depending upon the circumstances and
time of its utterance, as Justice Holmes reminded us years
ago.

I am mindful of that, but here is what Mr. Justice

Stewart said in the Younger case;

"in such circumstances,

the reasons of policy for deferring to state adjudication are

33
outweighed by the injury flowing from the very beginning of
the state proceeding, by the perversion of the very process
that is supposed to provide vindication and by the need for
speedy and effective action to protect federal rights."
Now, we quoted that on page 74.

So, what Vendo is

saying is that it may pervert the processes of a state court
and notwithstanding comity or full faith and credit requires
that the state court judgment obtained by such means is
entitled to full faith and credit.
QUESTION:

Mr* Sears, I see why you referred to

Justice Holmes’aphorism before referring to Justice Stewart's
concurrence in Younger, because Younger wasn't dealing with
any final judgments of a state court, was it?

It was just

dealing with the inception of a state proceeding.
MR * SEARS :
QUESTION:

That's c orrect.
Do you think that reasoning would

necessarily carry over to a final judgment that was
presumably protected by the full faith and credit clause?
MR. SEARS:

Well, that is, of course, assuming now

that the judgment is protected by the full faith and credit
clause.
I mean this is a federal

statutory provision, and

the full faith and credit — Are you going to give full faith
and credit to a judgment procured in violation of federal
law?

Are you going to give full faith and credit to a

34
judgment which was part and parcel of a scheme to violate
the federal laws?
QUESTION:

Well, what's the scope of this

exception that you think is Implied in the full faith and
credit statute, where you don't have to give full faith and
credit the way the statute says?
MR* SEARS:

Well, I don't think the full faith and

credit statute applies at all,
QUESTION:
MR, SEARS:
stated*

Why not?
Well, for the very reason that I

I mean isn't It reductio ad absurdum to give full faith

and credit to a judgment in a federal court that was pro­
cured as part and parcel of a violation of the federal law?
You give that full faith and credit in a federal court?
I don't believe you do, with all deference*
QUESTION:

Does that mean, Mr* Sears, that the

threshold question in a claim for full faith and credit being
asserted, that the court to which that claim is presented
must relitigate the case and decide whether it is really
entitled to full faith and credit?
MR* SEARS:

Well, you know — I think that there

are a lot of statutory rules that say that a case within
the letter but without the spirit of the statute is without
the statute*

And a case without the letter but within the

spirit is within the statute,

35
Now, I think that is a sort of a casual or thumb­
nail statement, but I think there is substantial law to
support that proposition*
QUESTI®:

Was the full faith and credit issue

presented to Judge McLaren?.
MR* SEARS:

No, it was not presented to Judge

McLaren,
QUESTION;

Only 2283?

MR, SEARS:

2283 —

QUESTION:

That was presented but not the full

faith and credit?
MRc SEARS:

No, and it wasn't even argued, hardly,

in the circuit court of appeals, as I recall it.
QUESTION:

But it wasn’t presented to Judge

McLaren?
MR* SEARS:
QUESTION:

No, it was not, indeed*
Did the court of appeals address it?

MR* SEARS: I don’t think so*
of appeals didn’t address it*

I am sure the court

I shouldn’t be dogmatic*

Gcd knows ■— pardon me — I’ve lived long enough to know I
shouldn't be dogmatic about anything*
QUESTION:

Mr. Sears, what worries me Is aren’t

you asking for the exact same relief you would have asked
this Court on a cert?
MR* SEARS':

Oh, no, indeed-

36
QUESTION:

The difference?

MR. SEARS:

Well# the difference is# Your Honor,

that there weren’t any federal questions — I mean there
weren’t any federal questions, as such, except due process0
There were no federal antitrust questions involved in the
petition for cert.
QUESTION:

They involved due process.
But the fundamental relief you want is

to upset the judgment.
MR. BEARS:

In quotes, "to reverse it,"
No, we want it stayed, Your Honor.

I don’t mean to say that —
QUESTION:

How long would the stay be?

MR* SEARS:

Well, it will stay pen denti laeti,

the only issue that's before the court. It will stay pen denti
laeti.

Now, what the ultimate fate of that judgment might be

is a question to be decided upon a record where that question
is an issue.
With respect to that, I say, well, sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof.

We don't really have that
\

issue before us.
Now, I’ve about exhausted my time.

I want to

speak briefly to 2283*
We quoted Glttlin, an opinion by Judge Friendly, to
support the doctrine of Mltchum _vFogter.

They applied the

doctrine of Mltqhum .Y« Foster in studebaker v. Glttlin, and
you gentlemen are as familiar with that case as I am, if not

37
more so.
They came back and they relegated Sbudebalcer v ,
Gittlin to a footnote, both In their original brief and in
their reply brief, and they quoted -« 1 guess

The white

light says I have a few more minutes -- Thank you.

They

quoted three eases, Vernltron, Jennings and Glenn VJ« Turner,
as contrary to the issuance of the injunction here.
Each one of those cases, completely dissimilar on
the facts, none Involved violation of the federal antitrust
laws, but the interesting'thing about those three cases is
the fact that each one of them recognized the doctrine,
recognized Studebaker v> Gittlin, which they relegated to a
footnote and said that was just by way of dictum.
So I don't see how they can be contrary to what
vie are arguing here when they expressly recognize a case
upon which we rely,
And that's what the District Court — The District
Court did the same thing*

For example, in Jennings which is

proeedurally a very similar case to ours, Judge Alderset,
for the Third Circuit, said, "Certainly, Studebaker qualified
under the test subsequently set forth in Mitehum v, Foster,
whether an act of Congress clearly creating a federal right
or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity could foe
given its intended scope only by a stay in the state court
proceedings,"

38
Now., our case is stronger than the Securities Act
case for the very simple reason that the Securities Act does
not provide federal damages, nor does it, except in some rare
cases, as I understand the law, and I am not absolutely
certain of this

It does provide to some cases for the

assessment of damages against the defendant.
Now, briefly, on comity in federalism, ,Ifve quoted
the separately concurring ©pinion of Mr, Justice Stewart with
respect to that question.

And I think that Judge McLaren —

the late Judge McLaren — I am perfectly content to rely on
his very carefully written opinion affirmed by the Court of
Appeals iA;ifch respect to that question,
QUESTION;

Mr, Sears, did the judge, the late

judge, consider the Supreme Court of Illinois as holding that
the directors had violated their fiduciary relationship?
MR. SEARS;
QUESTION;
MR. SEARS;

Indeed, he did.
What did he say about it?
He said that this was part and parcel

of the anti-competitive covenants and they couldn't be
snipped apart.

He specifically said that in answer to their

How can you

How is it possible for a court to say

that this judgment can stand insofar as the antitrust laws
are concerned?

This is what we are talking about.

We are

talking about a case that was prosecuted as part and parcel
of a scheme to violate the antitrust laws»
Now* if this was prosecuted as a part of a scheme
to violate the antitrust laws* it doesn't make any difference
whether the means employed were lawful or unlawful.

It

doesn't make a bit of difference whether there was a suc­
cessful consummation of a scheme which had an illegal
objective»

They mention that -QUESTION:

Are you saying that even if there

hadn't been any anti-competitive contracts involved* you
could still allege and you had hoped to prove that the
suit for breach of fiduciary duty was part of an illegal
scheme?

Of course, It was.

Of course it was

bound up with it, and so McLaren held, and -we think that
finding is binding on Judge McLaren -MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

(Whereupon, at 12:01 o'clock, p*m., oral argument in

42
AFTERNOON SESSION

(1:01 p.m.)
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
complete your rebuttal,

Mr, Pollock, you may

You have three minutes, as you

know*
*

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL E, POLLOCK, ESQ *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, POLLOCK:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,

In those three minutes, I would like to make
three very brief points„
First of all, with respect to the trouble-damage
suit which is proceeding ahead in the trial court,
Mr, Sears, once again, raises the specter that Vendo, if
allowed to collect these judgments, will obtain control of
these two corporations which Stoner controlled, LektroVend and Stoner Investments.
At the District Court, at the Court of Appeals
and now in the Supreme Court of the United States, xve wish
to make clear that Vendo will not obtain control, and,
indeed, consent judgments to that effect were offered in the
District Court,
So far as taking control of those two companies
so that somehow there would be loss of Article 3 jurisdic­
tion by virtue of case or controversy, there simply is no
issue.

It is at most a red herring which obscures the fact

43
that the respondents do have their trouble-damage remedy,
they are proceeding ahead, there is no danger that those
two companies will be taken over by Vendo.

Vendo does not

wish to have those two companies and they have that very
adequate remedy.

Indeed, their claim has been that in the

trouble-damage case they will be able to recover three times
the amount of the judgment, whether collected or not.
We, of course, do not acquiesce in that position.
Second, I would like to very tersely amplify my
answer to a series of questions that Mr. Justice White
directed to me.
After talking with my colleagues, it appears that
I may have not answered all aspects of Mr. Justice White's
question.
Mr. Justice White asked whether there would be
any question, other than 2283, if the respondents had not
withdrawn their federal antitrust defense and had actually
litigated it, and I think I replied that there would, indeed,
be a significant comity-federalism issue in terns of
collateral estoppel and what the Impact of that adjudication
would be in the federal proceeding, furthermore, if they had
never raised the defense in -the state proceeding a-nd

r ;

simply had ignored it.
There would be a significant question, Your Honor,
under the .Hoffman case, with respect to the propriety of
a

44
an injunction against the state court proceeding* If it is
true that there is an adequate opportunity to have presented
that question in the state proceeding.
On the other hand* if there was no opportunity —
QUESTION;

They cou!dnst present their affirmative

claim in the state proceeding.
MR. POLLOCK;

Well* there is no dispute here*

Your Honor* that — No one is attempting to deprive them
of the right to present their trouble-damage claim.
QUESTION:

I know* but under Hoffman* you dismiss

the case.
MR, POLLOCK:

Well* because Hoffman, was seeking

only injunctive relief,
QUESTION:

Well* you dismissed the case.

MR. POLLOCK:

Yes,

Well* in this instance* we

are talking only about a comity-federalism bar to an
injunction.

We are not* in any sense* taking the position

that they are precluded from maintaining their troubledamage remedy.
•r

And* finally* the third point.

One of the really

key issues here* the threshold issue, I think* is the 2283
issue.

We have not had an opportunity to review that issue

as fully as we should.

We urge review of our brief*

particularly with respect to what we believe to be the
utter distortion of the Mifcehum decision and the fact that

^5
adoption of the decision below,, with respect to the
expressly authorized exception, would apply to literally
dozens of federal statutes which we have set forth at pages
10 and 11 of our reply brief, which are, in every respect,
identical to Section 16 of the Clayton Act, for purposes of
obtaining injunctive relief.
Thank you very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:05 o’clock, p.m., the ease in
the above-entitled matter was submitted,}
