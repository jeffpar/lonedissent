ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE COLVIN COCHRAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COCHRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. COCHRAN:

Mr. Cochran.

Members of the Court, I9d like to

reserve ten minutes, please, for rebuttal.
My name is George Cochran.

I represent the

an attorney from Ashland, Mississippi, who handled the case
through the Northern District of Mississippi in the 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals.
efforts in this case you

Primarily due to Mr. Farese's
now have the record as it is

presented to the Court, and which I will spend a great deal
of time on this morning.
This case, of course, arises out of Calhoun County,
Mississippi.

And what occurred in Calhoun County is, the

public school board there made the decision not to re-hire
the petitioners in this case for the sole reason that they
sent their children to a private, segregated academy also
located in Calhoun County.
There is nothing in the record that indicates the

petitioners were nothing other than competent and respected
by their students, fellow faculty members and the
administration.

Specifically,, the only reason they were

terminated was due to their decision to exercise what this
Court has deemed to be a fundamental right in Runyon to
send their children to a private, segregated academy.
Now, there are significant problems with the case
as it now comes before you.
policy as stipulated.

One problem, I think, is the

And to understand what happened in

Calhoun County, I think, one has to understand that the
policy —- understand the policy under which the school board
was operating.
On page 9 of the record there is a stipulation made
by Mr. Farese in cooperation with counsel for the opposing —
for the school board that this policy as applied was limited
to teachers teaching in Calhoun County and living
the County.

within

And if they met these two prerequisites, then

they had to send their children to the public schools of
that County.

And this —

QUESTION:

Does that mean that somebody could live

just outside the County line and not be subject to the policy?
MR. COCHRAN:
getting to now.

Mr. Justice Blackmun, that’s what I’m

The policy that I have brought to the Court’s

attention in my brief on the merits is altered from what I
had in the petition for certiorari.

I have cited the Court

5

to page 298 of the record which is the answer filed by the
respondents in the case as it began.

The answer filed by-

respondents indicate that this policy has two prongs.

The

first is, if you’re living in the County, then — and teaching
in the public schools — then you must send your children
to the public schools of Calhoun County.

If you’re livincr

outside the County, then you must send your children to
quote public schools.

Mot necessarily the schools in Calhoun

County,
On page 32 of the record —
QUESTION:

Well, your children might not be eligible

to go to the schools in Calhoun County.
MR. COCHRAN:

In Calhoun County.

There would be

that problem, yes.
QUESTION:

They would be in another county.

MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, yes.

On page 32 of the record, counsel for the respondent
refers to the policy as stipulated and alters it somewhat.
This time the policy is described to mean that if you teach
in the public schools of Calhoun County then you have to
send your children to quote public schools.

So we have a

difference in the record as to what teachers had to do to
comply; that is, whether to send your children to the pullie
schools of Calhoun County or to the public schools anywhere
in the United States.

This is kind of firmed up on pages 134

6

and 135? the final reference in the record to it.

Mr. Farese

is examining an expert witness, and he refers to the policy
as applying to teachers having to send their children to
public schools in the County.

There8s an objection made by

opposing counsel, and the question is rephrased in the context
of sending children to public schools.
I choose to say that the policy has two separate
facets to it: one, sending your children to public schools
in Calhoun County? and two, sending your children to quote
public schools.

And this dovetails, I think, quite nicely

with what you have in the record with respect to teachers who
were threatened not to be re-hired because they sent their
children to schools that might not have been public.
QUESTION:

Is your position the same as that taken

by the Court of Appeals?
MR. COCHRAN:

No.

The Court of Appeals adopted

98

X? 23

Judge Ready's finding with respect to the policy,- and that
was, in essence, that if yoxi taught in the public schools
of Calhoun County you had to send your children to the
public schools of that county.

But it doesn't mesh with

the record, because we have the Enochs, who are black teachers,
and Hamblin, a white teacher, sanding their children to
schools outside of Calhoun County.

And checks are made as

to whether or not these schools are public or private.
indication is they would not have been re-hired.

The

QUESTION:

But ordinarily if the District Court

makes a finding and the Court of Appeals upholds it, we
don't review that kind of evidentiary point.
MR. COCHRAN:

On page 509 of Pickering — no, I'm

sorry, page 509 of Tinker, the Court very clearly says it
will make an independent review of the record when First
Amendment questions are at issue.
make an independent review.

And in Tinker you did

You're almost to the point of

saying, the District Court said the cow jumped over the moon.
We won’t review it.
QUESTION:
fact?

You think that goes to a historical

I mean, just like who did what to whom?

Or what

happened at the dance?
MR. COCHRAN:

I think it's critical in deciding the

constitutional issue in this case.

And it's part of

constitutional facts as to what —
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the constitutional

facts are any facts that might be relevant to the ultimate
decision on the constitutional question, including what days
school opened in Calhoun County that particular year?
MR. COCHRAN:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what I'm

pointing to with this fact is that in order to understand
the purpose and the thrust behind what the public school board
in Calhoun County was doing, I think these facts are critical
because we have a very articulately drawn policy and you have

8

to focus In on the thing to understand exactly what was
going on in the County.

That's the only point I’m trying

to make.
And the other point is that if you don’t construe
the policy different — differently then the Court of Appeals
and the United States District Court, then you can’t deal
with these other teachers whose re-employment was threatened
because they sent their children to, say, schools in Atlanta
or Jackson, Mississippi.
to make.

That’s the only point I’m trying

I really don’t think it’s critical, except that

there8 s a problem with the record on the basis of exactly
how does this policy operate.
I believe that if you look at the record you can
ascertain that — fairly that the policy has three purposes.
And the purpose that has been dealt with by the Courts below,
of course, has been compliance with a desegregation order
146

entered by Judge Keady in 1968.

The taking positive and

affirmative steps to implement a unitary school system.

I'll

talk about that purpose later on.
I think there are also two other purposes that
are clear from the record.

One is, ensuring dedication by

public school teachers to the public schools.
clear.

And this is

All the expert testimony in this case indicates

that one of the primary thrusts of the policy was to ensure
loyalty on the part of the teachers, the theory being that

9

*

if you don't send you children to the public schools then
you won't be loyal to schools in which you're teaching.
The record also bears out that this aspect of the
poliy, that is, ensuring dedication, was carried out in fact
by the persons responsible for its

There are two parts of the record in which —

implemented.

their children to a school in Atlanta.

They sent

And they were

threatened with termination until it was found that these
were indeed public schools.

The same thing with Hamblin, who

sent his children to the Magnolia School for the Deaf.

And

again his employment was threatened at that time.
QUESTION:

Do you think it would make any difference

to your case if the conduct of the school board here were
pursuant to statutes enacted by the legislature in the
State of Mississippi as distinguished from an ad hoc policy
of the local board?
MR. COCHRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, that would be if

the Mississippi State legislature passed a statute which
in essence decreed that public schools could mandate
that teachers teaching there
the public schools?

had to send their children to

10
QUESTION:

No, not could, must.

MR. COCHRAN:

Must.

Clearly, there’d be First

Amendment problems, Pierce v. the Society of Sisters, and
a serious encroachment on the exercise of First Amendment
rights by the teachers.
QUESTION:

Well, what I'm trying to get at is the

difference between these sporadic decisions by local school
boards and a declared policy of the state by its legislature.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, but still, the difference

between sporadic and policy by the state legislature, still
you have First Amendment problems with the teachers
involved.
QUESTION:

Do you think there’s any difference in

degree?
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

You mean as to the empirical basis —

In the Mitchell case the Court held that

certain First Amendment rights of public employees
be limited.

could

And that’s been reaffirmed from time to time.

MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If just the particular governmental

agency, the head of the agency, had. made that decision ad
hoc a policy of his own agency, do you think that would have
made a difference?
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, if it's an ad hoc decision

rather than the historical data gathering that you had in

11

Mitchell you have the sane problems because you’re infringing
First Amendment riqhts without a serious record finding that
QUESTION:

Where did you get a First Amendment

problem in this case?
MR. COCTTRAN:

Fell, the mere fact that the teachers

are exercising their fundamental rights to send their
children to a private, segregated school.
QUESTION:

okay, when you said fundamental right

you said First Amendment right.
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

How do you spell out of the First

Amendment a right on the part of the teachers to send
their kids to a private school?
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, you can read Pierce v. Society

of Sisters would be a First Amendment case, but —
QUESTION:
to it.

Well, that had some religious overtones

Here there are no religious overtones.
MR. COCIIRAN:

Well, there was a military school

also involved in Pierce.

Hut Runyon last term you all

reaffirmed, in no certain terms —
QUESTION:

The Court reaffirmed.

MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, the Court reaffirmed that —

Pierce against the Society of Sisters

involved also the Hill School, I think.
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, sir.

It was a military school.

12

QUESTION:

It was a companion case.

Which was just

a private, nonsectarian school.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think Pierce rested entirely

on the First. Amendment?
MR. COCIIRAN:
due process case.

No, I believe it's a substantive

But in Runyon you did utilize that case

to bolster the finding in Runyon that you have a fundamental
right to send your child to a private, secrregated school.
QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't necessarily mean

a First Amendment right.
MR. COCHRAN:

No.

The Court dealt at length with

whether or not it really was a First Amendment right in
Runyon„
QUESTION:

And what did it say?

MR. COCHRAN:

In part resting on the First Amendment

and freedom of association, part on Pierce v. Boeiety of
Bisters.
QUESTION:

And you fit both in?

HR. COCHRAN:

Oh, certainly I do.

I — the point

I'm trying to make is, I don't think there's any question
whatsoever that these teachers were exercising a fundamental
constitutional right, no matter how it's defined.
QUESTION:

Well, why is this case different from

the school board regulation that says you have to live
within the school district if you're going to teach?

13

Certainly that could infringe your right of association
too o

Maybe you x«rant to associate with people in the next

county.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, as you know, these cases have

been tried on — most of these cases have been tried on the
right to travel theory.

And this Court last term reaffirmed

in a short per curiam that regulations such as that are
constitutional but did not point up to any fundamental
constitutional right as being encroached by these regulations
that would require you to live in the area where you teach
or work.
QUESTION:

You’re speaking now of the oolicemen

and firemen's cases?
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Well, Kelley is one.

Rut McCarthy —

Do you think those help you or hurt you

here?
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, Kelley certain doesn't hurt,

simply because — if we’re aoing into Kelley, then hair
length was not determined to be a. fundamental right in
Kelley.

And if you're going into McCarthy v„ Civil Service

Commission,

the short opinion last term, there is nothing

in that opinion that indicates

that a fxmdamental right

was involved to be counterbalanced against the state's
interest in making you reside where you live.

All those

/

cases are distinguishable on the basis that no fundamental

*

14
rights are involved»

Here %\*e do have a fundamental right

being exercised, that is, the right to. send youx" child to a
private, segregated academy under Runyon and Pierce.
QUESTION:

Pierce went off on liberty, didn't it?

MR. COCIIRATI:
QUESTION:

Substantive due process liberty —

It seiid, liberty.

It used the word

liberty.
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Somewhere will you discuss the new

Mississippi legislation?
MR. COCHRAN:

I'd be certainly glad to take that

up at this point, Mr. Justice Black.

There is a new

Mississippi statute passed after the United States
District Court opinion which in essence says that school
boards can no longer require public school teachers to send
their children to the public schools.

Under the United

States District Court opinion, the 5th Circuit opinion, Mr.
Justice, I have a serious doubt as to whether or not this
statute is constitutional.

The United States District Court

said that part of implementing a court desegregation decree
that postivie, affirmative steps would be taken, and one
positive, affirmative step is, you cannot send you child
to a private, segx*egated academy.
QUESTION:

Well, the District Court didn’t require

the school district to impose such a condition, did it?

15

MR. COCIIRAN:

Mo, but on page 30 — if you look at

page 39(a) in the petition for certiorari, the last cart of
the opinion written by Judge Ready, he refers to what the
school board has done as part of its affirmative duty.
Department of Justice takes the same position.

The

On page 402

and 403 of the record you have a letter from David Norman of
the Department of Justice when he comments on this policy',
and he indicates that the Department of Justice position
is that this is part of the duty under a court desegregation
decree to take positive, affirmative steps.

So therefore,

if it’s part of a. court decree vis a vis implementing a
unitary school system, then the statute is going to be
unconstitutional as applied to teachers who send their
children to private, segregated schools.
QUESTION:

Well, but Judqe Ready didn’t have that

question before him when he ruled, did he?
MR. COCHRAN:

No, he did not.

The statute was

passed after Judge Ready entered his decree.

The 5th

Circuit, ox course, did not take it up and footnote it away.
There is no question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the
statute is retroactive.

We have an attorney general's

opinion that indicates it5s not retroactive.

And again,

my contention would be that the school board at this
point cannot comply with that statute simply because it's
under a 5th Circuit order that what they’re doing is
constitutional.

Bo you have a conflict between the constitutional

16
requirements of the 5th Circuit and state statute.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't believe the Court of

Appeals held that the school board must have this policy,
only that it could.

I mean, if I'm right about that, then

there's no real conflict.
HR. COCHRAN:

Well, that's the problem.

I — in

reading the 5th Circuit opinion it's difficult to really
understand what the 5th Circuit is saying just because you
have a complete split between Judge Coleman, Judge Roney
and Judge Clark.
QUESTION:

Yes.

HR. COCHRAN:
Ready

But the opinion written by Judge

our clear reading of this opinion — would indicate

that as part of affirmative duty to implement a unitary
school system this type of a decree should and must be
implemented.

That's the way I read Judge Ready's opinion.

And he could — he’s adopting it as his own.

That opinion

says — he starts off his opinion talking cibout his court
order in 1968 to integrate the schools, positive, affirmative
steps.

Then in the later part of the opinion, he's approving

this and making it part of the court order.
I still would say that the state statute is in
constitutional jeapordy when read in the context of the
lower cdurt opinions.
QUESTION:

Whs-re's the text of the statute?

I

17
can't — I couldn't —■
MR. COCHRAN:

It's in footnote 5 of my brief on

the merits.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, a footnote.

No, it’s not.

I'm

awfully sorry.
QUESTION:

No, I don't find that.

MR. COCHRAN:

The new statute — it would be found

in the respondent's brief on the merits.

And it is located

on page 19.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. COCHRAN:

Well first —- let me get back.

That

this school board in Calhoun County, one part of the thrust
of the policy was to ensure dedication and loyalty on the
part of the teachers.

This is completely divorced from

compliance with a court decree implementing a unitary
school system.
Another factor which is clear in the record which
motivated this decision is the private, segregated academy
itself.

You get testimony in the record such as that from

John Burt, the superintendent, where he's speakina to the
policy and speaking in terms of, we don't need a private,
segregated school in Calhoun County.
In another portion of the record, you have Mallory,
who is the school board president; on 218 he's questioned

on direct examination as to what influenced him or the
board in passing this policy.

And he puts into the record

newspaper clippings showing fund raising activities on the
part of the academy.

It’s obvious that part of the influence

and part of the thrust behind what the school board was
doing was to curtail competition on the part of the private,
segregated academy, another aspect of the policy that has
serious constitutional problems under Pierce v. the Society
of Sisters.
The last part of the policy, and that which the
letter courts have spoken to, is compliance with the court
order to integrate the school.

And in looking at this

aspect, I think it’s a correct thing to do to look at
the history of what was going on in Calhoun County at the
time this policy was cassed in order to ascertain whether
or not this policy was really needed in order to implement
a unitary school system under the court decree.
How Mallory, the school board president, testified
that the policy had been under consideration for two or
three years, which would mean, in essence, that the school
board started thinking about this policy immediately after
it was put under court order; that is, in the context that
the United States District Court Judge had not gone far
enough in his order, and that they should take independent
steps beyond that which the United States District Court

19

ordered.
There are 2,400 students in the Calhoun County system.
At the time the policy was passed, only eight teachers
were involved sending their children to private, segregated
schools.

The school where petitioners were — I'll continue
*

on rebuttal.

Save ten minutes.

Thank you.

Mr. Hickman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILL A. HICKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HICKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
That at the time that the Calhoun School Board was
*

under a desgregated order, and pursuant to the mandates of
this Court to take affirmative action to do what they
felt necessary, whatever steps to be necessary, to accomplish
elimination of segregation root and branch, this Board
adopted a policy.
#3.93
A-9

The policy is as stated in

a.

9 that prior to

employment or re-employment of any teacher, the children
of that teacher, living in Calhoun County, would attend
the private — public schools.

That is the policy that

was stipulated by counsel at the beginning of the hearing
in the District Court.
We shoxild keep in mind that this was an unwritten
policy, and that it was only stipulated after some discussion

20

between members of the board, between counsels for the
petitioners.

And it was determined that that was the

policy.
Now —
QUESTION:

Are there any exceptions?

Or any question

o f hardship, or anything like that?
MR. HICKMAN:

The policy, as it was drafted on the

face, and as the District Court recognized, applied literally
to all schools.

But, as the District Court found, and from

the evidence adduced at the hearing, there were no schools
in Calhoun County other than this one racially discriminatory
all-white private academy, which incidentally had obtained
its charter for organization 19 days after the Court's
desegregation order.
QUESTION:

Was there any special school for

handicapped children —
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Suppose there had been.

MR. HICKMAN:

The president of the board testified

that would have been taken up at that tine.
his words.

I believe it's

Nov? in all candor the superintendent and the

principal testified that it was a blanket policy.

_..

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I would say that you would
have to take the background of this rural county school board,
the rural superintendent, the rural principal, in an area

21
where there are no special schools»

And when they said it

applied to all schools, and as Judge Keady found, wa submit
they were talking about the Calhoun Academy.
QUESTION:
Calhoun?

How many children, then, is that from

Less than 200?
MR» HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR» HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

In the academy?

Yes, sir»

And did this, in your estimation — did

it or did it not pose a threat to the functioning of the
public schools?
MR, HICKMAN:
QUESTION :

It did.

By sheer numbers?

MR» HICKMAN:

Well, no, sir, I would not say in

the numbers, I would say that — that this board was under
the order of the court.

And in order for it to obtain the

support that it had to have in this community it had to make
sure that the teachers, that the administration, did support
their action in carrying out the District Court's order to
eliminate all pervasive influences of the lingering remnants
of segregation, both root and branch.

And that by this

teacher being in the classroom, and as evidence adduced
at the trial indicate, that I'm standing in the public
classroom, I'm paid from state tax money, I'm sending my
child to a private school.

The student could perceive

22
a rejection on the part of the teacher, and say, all right,
this school is inferior.
school.

My child is not going to this

I don’t think the school is good enough —
QUESTION:

Did you prohibit the teacher from making

a speech against it?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Could we prohibit the teacher?

Yes, sir.

MR. HICKMAN:

Justice Marshall, the presence of

the teacher in the classroom without saying anything —
QUESTION:

I said, if the teacher made a public

speech outside the classroom, could she be denied employment
because she made a speech outside the class calling for
segregated schools and opposed to integrated schools?
MR. HICKMAN:

Your honor, during this transition

period, and while under the Court order, I would say, yes.
QUESTION:

She could do that?

MR. HICKMAN;

Yes.

I would say that during the

transition period
QUESTION:

Oh, that the school board could deny

her employment?
MR. ITICKMAN:

I would say that during the transition

period that if the teacher went on a crusade, and took
action contrary to this court’s order —
QUESTION s

I said, she made a speech

in which ^he

said she was in favor of segregation and opposed to the p'ourt

23
order and opposed to integration, one speech.
HR. HICKMAN:

I would not think just one speech.,

no, sir.
QUESTION:

How many?

MR. HICKMAN:

Well, I think it would depend on the

effect that it would have.

I think that it would depend on

where the speech was made.

1 think that if it was made

in a part of Calhoun County where a lot of the people
heard it —
QUESTION:

Made in the public square in the County

seat.
MR. HICKMAN:

Your honor, during the transition

period, and while this board was under court order, if
that speech was made in Calhoun County, Mississippi, on the
public square, I would say that the board would have the
right to curtail ■—
QUESTION:

The freedom of speech guaranteed by the

First Amendment?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And they would have the right to do that?

MR. HICKMAN:

I would say that under that circumstance

at that point in time, maybe temporarily -- and let me make
this point — I think that this is a temporary action.

We

do not contend, your honor, that this action is a permanent
action.

It may well be that in another area in the same

24
school a teacher could apply and have a child in the public
school, and it wouldn’t have the same effect.

But during

this transition period — this is the problem area.

When the

board is under the court order to bring about the dasegregation
take affirmative steps.
QUESTION:

When statements such —

During that period freedom of speech

goes by temporarily?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Very temporarily.

Yes. You just give it up temporarily.

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

I say temporarily.

And I would say this, your honor —

And which case do you rely on for that?

MR. HICKMAN:

Well, I rely on the Korematsu case,

I rely on the —
QUESTION:

On which case?

MR. HICKMAN:

Korematsu.

Korematsu

It’s a case

involving during the Japanese internment,
QUESTION:

Korematsu.

MR. HICKMAN:

Korematsu, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

QUESTION:

War powers.

QUESTION:

Yes, that’s war powers, yes, sure.

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Got any other ones?

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

And then —

Pardon?

Got another one?

Nearer at home?

25
MR. HICKMAN:

#503.5

Well, I would rely on the

case, yes.
QUESTION:

Which

one?

I mean the case that said

that temporarily you can be denied your First Amendment riqhts,
MR. HICKMAN:
#509

Well, we have a 5th Circuit Court,

hee v. Macon County,

under the

singleton case where,

teachers have applied for their jobs, and in order to obtain
the fatio certain teachers were not able to get their jobs
back.

In fact, they lost their jobs because of complying

with the order of the court.
QUESTION:

The First Amendment was in that case?

I'm talking about freedom of speech. It's a very simple point.
Well, I!ve got your position.
QUESTION:

Let me suggest an activity a little less

than, making the speech that Justice Marshall has suggested.
Suppose the public school teacher served on the board
/*•

of directors or board of trustees, without pay so that there
was no moonlighting problem — served on the board of trustees
of the segregated academy.

Do you think that would be

grounds for termination?
MR. HICKMAN;

I would think that in this transition

period, and with the history of this academy being formed
within 19 days after the court desegration order, that with
a teacher on the board of directors -in Calhoun County on the
private school, that the board would have the right to

26
temporarily curtail —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hickman, let's try to put

this thing perhaps in a little broader context.

Suppose

that during the height of the Vietnam War somebody on the
South East Asia desk in the State Department made a public
statement saying that he thinks the government's policy is
entirely wrong in South East Asia, do you think that the
government would have a right to fire him from that
position?
MR. HICKMAN:

Wo, sir.

I think that — now, is

this person employed by the government?
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

In the State Department.

QUESTION:

He's working on the implementation of

the government’s policy presumably.
MR. HICKMAN:

Well, I would think that that right

could be curtailed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hickman, is the policy involved in

this case unique to Calhoun County in Mississippi?
MR. IIICKMAN:
QUESTION;

The only County in the State?

MR. IIICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Did this policy cause the legislature in

1974 in Mississippi to adopt a statute that -—
MR. HICKMAN:

That’s correct, sir.

27
QUESTION:

How important is this case, then,

generally?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Wall, does this case have any importance

then beyond —
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

—■ beyond the individual claimants

involved?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

And —

They are claiming damages?

MR. HICKMAN:

Yes.

Now the District Court limited,

of course, the policy, and the 5th Circuit through Judge
Roney limits the policy.
QUESTION:

There are, perhaps, other counties and

cities in the State of Mississippi that are subject to
desegregation decrees.
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:
question.

That!s correct.

Mr. Hickman, I couldn’t hear the Justice’s

Was it directed to the ’74 legislation?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And what — even though it involves

repetition, would you state for me the — what comments you
have upon the effects of the new legislation upon this case?
MR. HICKMAN:

Well, the — certainly this present

statute prohibits the action that this board took.

I would

think that perhaps this action of the legislature was
prompted by this action that this board took in Calhoun
County,
QUESTION:

Are you saying that because of the

passage of the new legislation, this case should be dismissed
as improvidently granted?
HR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

You haven’t argued it.

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I have not.

YOu didn't suggest it ,tti your --

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

I would think that that has merit.

I did not.

— opposition to the petition for

certiorari.
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

I did not, sir.

Why?

MR. HICKMAN:

We felt that the limiting of the

thrust of the policy by Judge Keady, and by the 5th Circuit,
was sufficient for the reason for the court to affirm its
decision.

But after submitting our briefs and going into

that area we frankly feel, that that does have merit.
QUESTION:

In any event, you agree the case is

not moot?
MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Would you hire those teachers?

1

MR. HICKMAN:

Would we?

We’d certainly take

29
applications.

In fact, the record does not show that these

teachers have made an application»

They made no application

#5B0
QUESTION:

But you admit it's moot?

MR. HICKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Not moot.

MR. HICKMAN:

Well, it would be moot — it would —

in fact the statute would govern now until the determination
was made ■—
QUESTION:

I don't see how you -- you didn't mean

moot when you said, damages?
MR. HICKMAN:

No, sir.

If you review, as I say, the background, you will
find that the comments that had been made in the community,
that there was actually brother versus brother.

The brother

/

of the president of the school board attended this school
at this particular point in time.

There were references

made to derogatory statements about those that send their
children to school with certain individuals.

And this

was the background when this policy was adopted.
We submit that the finding of the District Court,
findings of fact — and it was upheld by the 5th Circuit —
would be the proper disposition of this case.

But in any

event, we do think that there is basis for the case to be
dismissed for the reason of the writ of certiorari being

30

improperly granted.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you one more question.

Suppose

we have a situation in neighborhood schools —- we don't have
that anymore, but suppose we did.

And the board said that

the teacher in this particular school must live within
the district.

Do you think that would be a valid restriction?

MR. HICKMAN:

Well, I believe that the courts have

approved the employees living within the district of the
city where they work.
QUESTION:

And —

MR. HICKMAN;
QUESTION:

And on that basis I would think so.

Yes, sir.

So any children that they have would

have to go to the neighborhood schools required in the
residency —
MR. HICKMAN:

Well, if they were — in a neighborhood

schools, yes, it would be —.

Now, I don't think that would

apply on exceptions.
But again I think that in this particular area that
at that point in time that these particular facts — and
as I say, this may be a short time that this had to be
done -— but we do. not contend, and little did we realize
that when this action was taken that it would become involved
to this extent.

The — this was — is a temporary action.

It may wall be that this action is not required, had the
statute not been passed.

Which, of course, now prohibits it.

31

And for these reasons we feel that this matter
should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cochran.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE COLVIN COCHRAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, sir.

A couple of points.

Apparently, Mr. Justice Blackmun and others are
referring to the Sioux City case as to whether or not this —
the decision below should be affirmed on the basis of opinion
by the Court that the writ is improperly granted.

I think

there's a quantum difference between Sioux City and this

MR. COCHRAN:

because of the statute now enacted by the Mississippi

QUESTION;

Well, no.

MR. COCHRAN;

That, on itself — on its face, I

think, is highly improbable.
QUESTION:

But

But certainly in Mississippi there is

this statute, then, now in effect?
MR. COCHRAN:

Certainly there is, and there's also

one of the most outstanding United States District Court
judges in the country, Judge Keady, who has now utilized
his judicial power to approve this tyoe of regulation, or
First Amendment —
QUESTION:

Well, he simply said it was oermissible.

MR. COCHRAN;

Yes, but that opinion can and will be

cited lerathe basic proposition that as part of a court order
desegregating a school it is permissible to utilize the
judicial power to curtail the right of teachers within
public schools to send their children to private, segregated
schools, and you can't read that decision any other way.
QUESTION:

Well, but it's permissible.

MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

And now —

Not permissible: the power is there.

Now the Mississippi legislature has said

it *s impermissible.
MR. COCHRAN:

Yes, but this —

It's not a

33

MR. COCHRAN:

No, I would contend that now the

school hoard's order, or the school board policy, is now
a part of the United States District Court's decree to
implement a unitary school system in Calhoun County.
QUESTION:

You really have to stretch to say that.

That wasn't his holding.
QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

Certainly my brother Stewart's analysis

is what the holding in the case was.

And you really have to

stretch to give your construction to it, don't you agree?
MR. COCHRAN:

Then let’s look at it another way.

Take Judge Ready5s opinion, take the 5th Circuit opinion.
These opinions can and will be read by other school boards
and by other United States District Courts that this type
of action is permissible vis a vis unitary school systems.

QUESTION:

Well, I assume that Judge Ready

The case might have come

out differently in the 5th Circuit.

Judge Coleman's opinion

certainly does not sound in terms of — that this was
necessary and desireable for the Court to do.

It sounds

I have a great deal of difficulty in reading

Judge Coleman's opinion and trying to ascertain exactly what
he means other than that the exercise of power by school
boards is subject to no judicial review whatsoever.

He

starts out his opinion saying no substantial federal question
is raised.

And quite obviously, I have a great deal of

difficulty with that opinion.

And I also have quite — a

great deal of difficulty with the problem of whether or not

of Rice v.

Sioux City.

And I think this case has nationwide

importance — if not nationwide, in the South.
QUESTION:

Well, is Judge Keady —

MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

And it’s not — I'm sorry.

Would Judge Keady*s view sustain a statute

or a state statute saying that parents must —- all parents
no parent; may send his child to a segregated school?
MR. COCHRAN:

Judge Keady, on page 39a, the petition

for certiorari, the reprint of his opinion, specifically
limits his decision to public school teachers sending their
children to private, segregated academies.
QUESTION:

Do you see any difference in principle?

MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

In what way, Mr. Justice?

Between applying the rule to just teachers

or to parents generally?
MR. COCHRAN:

You're talking about parents generally

can't send their children?

Well, no.

Under Runyon, you have

a clear right as a parant to send your child to a private,
segregated school.
QUESTION:

Well, that wasn't a holding in the case.

MR. COCHRAN:
introduction.

No.

But I'm talking about the

Part of Runyon, where you reaffirm the right,

but then you go into the right of the school under 1981 not

37
to admit qualified blacks.

Rut there's a difference between

the 1981 obligation on the part of the school versus the
right of a parent to send his child to a private school to
promote racial segregation.

And these two rights are separate.

You can't impute the school's violation of the law with the
parents who exercise their right to send their children there.
QUESTION:

So your answer is that Judge Ready would,

to the question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked your
opponent about a public employee working on the far Eastern

desk being discharged for making a speech against the policv
of the employer»
MR. COCHRAN:

The entire thrust of this case is the

absence of the standards and the facts that you find in
Tinker and Pickering, substantial disturbance, a lowering of
professional ability to work within the institutional
environment — the man cannot, be fired.

And that’s what we're

working with in this case here.
QUESTION:

Nould yoxa concede that he could be

fired if there had been evidence that children were distressed,
or parents were distressed, about the inconsistencies between
his job as a teacher —
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

In Cook v. Hudson?

In this very case, yes.

MR. COCHRAN:

Yes.

In Cook v. Hudson, you have a

public school teacher who is sending his child to a private
segregated academy, and if you can show a linkage between
that act and a lowering of his professional competency in
the classroom, that is, that this act of sending a child to
a private, segregated academy has influence the black students
in such a vray that he's no longer an effective teacher, out
he goes.

So the question really turns largely

on our view of the particular facts of this case?
