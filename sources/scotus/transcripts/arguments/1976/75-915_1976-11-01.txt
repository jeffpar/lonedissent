v. Robert

(Bobby) Smith, Et Al.
Mr. Safron,

I think you may proceed whenever you

are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAFRONs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
This case is before this Court on the grant of a

petition for writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals to review similar claims brought by various North
Carolina prisoners to the effect that, by not providing them
with 1 gal research facilities, the State of North Carolina
has denied their access to the courts.
The District Court in its original opinion tracked
the languages of the three-judge federal court in California,
in Gilmore v. Lynch,

and stated that the volumes available

would provide meager fare for a lawyer' who is trained in his
profession and. wen more meager far© for an inmate who has no
legal -training to assist him in discerning how to file what
petitioners and what to include in then.
The court takes notice that more than mere facts are
necessary in order to file petition for relief by way of

4
habeas corpus, for example.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affa.rmed la an
opinion, which is quite simplistic in its approach, stating
that the State of North Carolina has an obligation under the
various cases to provide legal research facilities.

And it is

our argument, and we submit, that the District Court erred
and that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its con­
clusions (1) that extensive legal research facilities are
required? and (2) that there is in fact a constitutional
obligation as a primary obligation to provide these facilities.
Mow, in support of this argument, I would first like
to point out that this Court has promulgated rules which go
into effect just about any day now, the new rules governing
3«ction 225* cases,

These rules go into effect .pursuant to

Public Law 94-349 thirty days after the recess of the 94th
Congres s.
Nov;, we take & look at these rules and we also take a
look at the forms in those rules and the forms currently available in all tl

United States District Courts to file habeas

corpus proceedings for state court prisoners in the District
Courts»
I l.rve her a a typical sample» of which I am sure the
Court - s well aware.

They fill in the blank form available

from any United States District Court clerk, and the forms are
quite, clear, that just set forth facts.

5
How, under the rul<

ich go into effect any day

now, the rules of this Court,? utilising the forms provided for
in these rules, it states quite clearly (1) in the instructions,
in setting forth the grounds, supporting facts — and the word
"facts” as prepared by this Court is in capital letters -supporting facts

cases or law,
Nov/, these are. the forms for us© in habeas corpus
which any day now will b© in effect.

And the instruction of

story briefly, without citing cases or lew.

MR. SAFRON:

Would ha say "I want out'"?

Well, Your Honor, this is a civil rights

MR. SAFRON:

I have no idea what he was working on,

QUESTION:

And these rules are prepared subsequent

Mr. Safron* in the response you made the

MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

The one — you said you responded to on©

MR. SAFRON?
QUESTION:

This was a civil rights form.
I understand, but did you — when you

respond, to these, do you sometimes cite cases?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Oh* yes* we do.

Now, this —

Mow, what is the point you ar© making

about the fact that the initial filing doesn’t require any
citation of casas?

What do you develop from that preaise?

MR. SAFRON:

What I mean is this, Your Honors

Th©

theory is that the inmate requires legal research facilities
in order to have access to the courts.
•There is access to the courts.

And my thesis is this?

The Federal Judiciary has

developed forms which make it perfectly clear that fchsr© ar©
no — you are not to cite cases, you are not to give legal
arguments in these filings.
QUESTION?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTIONS

Wow, Justice —

That is in the initial filing?
Yes. Your Honor.
Most litigation involves more than one

filing.
MR. SAFRON:

Oh, yes.

But the theory of these cases

up to this point has been that the inmate has been denied
access to the courts because they have not had legal research
facilities, and it is that thesis with which we do not agree.
Because as we take Mr. Justice White's dissent in Johnson v.
Avery, which is the fountainhead case '.in this area, h© made it
clear that filing a habeas corpus proceeding is a simple
rvfetar, because once it is filed, the court will apply the
lav fee the facia, and that is what happens in all these or the
va:r;; majority of tbre® orbvoaor carer.

Th® court obviously,

tbrergh the re® of its law clerk*, its legal research facili­
ties, the courts, as this Court, have law clerks whom they

9
carefully interview for many, many clerks who are legally
trained, so that they can provide a meaningful assistance tc
the Court.

And I question what type of meaningful assistance

is given the court, idle Federal Judiciary or the state
judiciaryr by same inmate who has a sixth grade education,
who isn’t trained, in the law.

He can't help the court.

X have seen cases cited — most cases which are
cited by the inmates ar© mis-cited or have no — can’t even be
found.
QUESTION i

I bet I have seen some you’ve mis-cited,

too, if I looked hard enough.
MR. SAFRON:

That is quit© possible, Your Honor, but

we try not to.
QUESTION;

1' don’t understand your point.

Your point

is that it trill not help him to have the library —
MR. SAFRON;
QUE£ -.’ION;
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
~ that he does not need the library.
I say that —
Now, h® is on on® side of the case and,

as my brother Stevens says, yea and your office is on the other

aide•

You have blank number of assistants, blank number of

par <i~‘legal, blank number of libraries and everything, and that
is an equal play, where in my mind it is not.
MR. SAFRON;
QUESTION;

First of all, Your Honor —
And I think Avery, despite what you think,

10

I think Avery is still the law.
MR. SAFRON:

Your Honor» I agrea that Johnson v.

Avery is the law, because — let's read Johnson v. Avery —
QUESTION:

Johnson v. Avery says one of the ways ©f

doing it is to give him some help.
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Your Honor, no, Johnson v. Avery -It says give him some help.
Johnson v. Avery says that there is a

secondary obligation, and the secondary obligation is if the
state prohibits mutual legal assistance between inmates, then
that gives rise to a necessity to determine alternatives.
Johnson v. Avery is clear.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

The law library is —

Do you agree with it?
Sir?
Do you agree with Johnson v. Avery?
Yes, I do.
And you want us to reaffirm it?
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

I suppose nothing in Johnson v. Avery

suggested that, the prisoner's resources have to be equal to
that of the state?
MR. SAFRON:

No, Your Honor, not at. all.

All 'that

Johnson v. Avery states is that the — if in the event the
state, th© department of corrections in a particular state,

11
passes a regulation prohibiting mutual legal assistance, then
in that event alternatives are required.
Mow, we turn to one of the last definitive statements
on this point of this Court, the case of Ross v. Moffitt,
written by Your Honor.

Now, in Ross v. Moffitt, this Court

mad© it clear that it is not the obligation of the state to
provide that legal arsenal which is available to the private
citirea.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, is it the position

of North Carolina that no library need be provided?
MR. SAPRON:

If Your Honor please, it is the position

of the State of North Carolina that if a library were to be
provided, it is; an administrative decision of the state and
that the Constitution and the cases of this Court do not re­
quire the state to provide legal research facilities.
QUESTION:

No library facilities at all, no access,

for example;, to the slip op ions or the decisions of this Court?
MR. SAFROMs
QUESTION:
bit.

That is correct, Your Honor.
Right.

Now, may I follow that up just a

You emphasize the forms — and I understand why you do.

>: thixf': they ert certainly not irrelevant.

But is it not

possible that inmates may need access to the opinions of this
Court, for example, to determina whether or not to consider
filing a petition for habeas corpus or & civil rights action?
MR. SAP RON:

If Your Honor pleas®, number* on®, filing

12
a habeas corpus proceeding is tbs simplest thing in the world.
And as Mr. Justice White pointed out in his dissent, w© used
only look at the record ~~

It is still over the dissent?
Oh, yes, Your Honor.

But in your dis­

sent, you pointed out and the majority agreed that filing the
habeas corpus petition is the simplest thing.

You just state the facts.

No law is re­

And obviously — and it

lias bsejs my experience, and as Your Honors are well awar® —
when these petitions coma in, the federal judge arid his law
clerks and the.. United States magistrate reviews these things.
And it has been my experience that, of course, let’s se© what,
happens.

In that particular situation, it is reviewed.

In a

few situations where the relief sought is obviously frivolous,
Ilk© w© have had complaints filed "I want credit for time
spent on escape," in those instances the petition would be

Now, the inmate need merely give a notice of appeal
and the entire record goes up to the Fourth Circuit where a
three-judge panel in the Circuit Court reviews it, and the
Circuit Court, judges have the assistance of —
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you wash

over

Younger v. Gilmore, don’t you?
MR. SAFRON:
Younger case.

Your Honor, I would like to speak to the

I would say this, that Younger was improperly

13
decided, that, Younger should be overruled.

Wa have a ons-

paragraph per curiam, and it cites two cases, Alabama Teachers,
which really gees to the proposition that this Court has
jurisdiction on appeal from a three-judge District Court, and
it cites Johnson v. Avery.
Now, Johnson v. Avery merely held explicitly that
the state his no such obligation unless there is a prohibition
of mutual legal assistance.

In the State of North Carolina,

as the Court readily finds, there is no such prohibition
against mutual isgal assistance.
QUESTION%

Now —

Let ms get back to your basis.

Are you

taking this position on th© theory that the law library would
fcs useless?
MR. SAFRON:

Your Honor., perhaps to a small handful

of inmates, it nr.y b© useful,

a small handful of inmates who

porhapa, h&vi the intelligence to utilize these facilities.

But

art a maicber of -ha bar, quite frankly, I almost take tills as a
personal insult.

I went through collage, I went -through, law

school, I took the bar axara, in order to ba trained in legal
research, and quit® often, as this case itself reveals, there
are attorneys on both sides and courts on both sides which
disagree on what the law actually is in any given case.
QUESTIONS

Now —

Did th© State of North Carolina make

application for an LSAA grant for a library?
HR. SAFRON;

Your Honor, what happened there, we were

14
under the order of Judge Larkins to implement this.

The

Director of Prisons of -the Stats of North Carolina went
before the Advisory Budget Commission of the North Carolina
General Assembly with Judge Larkins" order in hand, and the
Advisory Budget Commission of the state, in preparing the
budget for submission, found or said that they would not
appropriate such funds, that they had never heard of anything
as foolish as that, that they had other needs for state re­
sources, and fehsy ware not going to appropriate money for
prison law libraries when the state has not yet found it able
financially to provida any such facilities to the judges of
our courts of the state or district attorneys, and it would in
fact result that in many areas the judges to find such
facilities would be appearing in the prisons.

And we have 77

units spread across our state, across 475 miles.

It would b©

as if w@ went from Raleigh, where I live, to New York city»
That in the distance.
QUESTION:

That is a tremendous distance.
But getting back to my question, you did

The LEAA grant was prepared' because the

General Assembly refused to fund any money and made it per­
fectly clear that they would net condone any line item transfers.

that application state that a prison library would ba useful?

or a grant? ©as puffs to get the money, and that was puffing
to receive an LSAA grant, because the —

MR. SAPRON:

So the answer is yes?
Yes.

But, if Your Honor pleas®, that

still does not gat to the basic constitutional question.

Now,

QUESTION:

So it does get to your statement that the

libraries would b® useless?
MR. SAPRON:

Your Honor, unfortunately, that grant

was salesmanship, it was seeking — that application was seeking
a grant.

You have to say what LEAA wants to hear to gat the

grant,.

Now, '-:±a facts and figures ar® interesting.

In the

Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1973, seme 46 percent of
prisoner civil rights cases in the United Statas were filed.

17
AFTERNOON SESSION - la 00 0«CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
MR. SAFRON:

You may continue,- Counsel*

Mr. Chief Justice, as we. w©ra stating

at the break, ia the State of North Carolina, w© have developed
extensive stats post-conviction proceedings and also have ex­
tensive rules for the appointment of counsel to indigent de­
fendants .
As in the federal system, when a state court
prisoner files a petition, that, petition is reviewed by the
state court judge*

If the state court judge finds any marit

in the petition, ha will appoint counsel to represent the
petitioner in a plenary hearing.

If he finds no merit in -the

petition, he obviously dismisses the petition.
However, in the stata court system unlike the federal
ate has an absolute right to the appointment of
counsel to seek certiorari from the North Carolina Court of
Appeals!, therefore he has counsel to prepare his petition for
writ

car tier ari to the North Carolina Court of Appeals,

where it is reviewed and, of course, ruled on upon that court.
I would like to point out to the; Court that in our
brief there is an appendix —
QUESTIONS

Just before you proceed to that, what

would be the mechanics of his getting counsel in your state

— and files a collateral complaint of

soai© kind in your stats court.

It is denied.

Now, how does he

or anybody else know that it has been denied, how does he go
about getting counsel to appeal that?
MR. SAPRONs

Well, of course, Your Honor, he is pro™

vided with a copy of the order of the court denying his peti*
tion and, under North Carolina General Statuta 15-22?* which
provides for petitions for certiorari to the north Carolina
Court of Appeals,and North Carolina General Statute 7A-451,
which is the statute providing for the appointment of counsel
for indigente, /ill he need merely do is writes the court raqu^sting appointment of counsel and counsel will be appointed
to represent him on a petition for certiorari to the North

MR. SAPRON;
QUESTION;

Of course, Your Honor ~~
Does he or do-ssn't he?
If the court finds merit and holds a

But if th© court

case?

If the petition makes out a plausible

19
MR. SAFRON:
under ®r statute

— a plausible case, he has a right

7A-451 to the appointeant of counsel, and

the court appoints counsel to represent that petitioner.
QUESTIONS

But. if the court finds no merit and there™

for© doesn't appoint counsel, and further therefor© denies the
writ, h& still has an absolute right to counsel to appeal it,
doesn't he?
MR. SAFRON;

Ke has the absolute right of appointment

of counsel to assist him to prepara the petition for writ of
certiorari to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, right.
QUESTION:

And how does he — he gets a copy of the

order of denial?
MR. SAFRON';

He writes a letter to the court, "I

appeal, appoint a lawyer for me."

And so actually in the state

system, the lawyer is appointed, whereas in the federal system
at that point, there is no right to counsel.
QUESTION;
MR. SAFRON;

At. either point?
At either point.

I would like to point

cut th^t in the appendix to our brief on the merits, we have
reviewed the histories of these various inmates who are the;
plaintiffs in the initial case.
Now, the various cases to which we refer, Mr. Make11
sent a young attorney who spent two days in cur office review­
ing all these files. And I would ask this Court to read that
appendix, that, appendix carrnsncing on page 25, and it reveals

.

how the state has appointed counsel time and time again at
-chase post-conviction proceedings, how the state has appointed
counsel on petition for review on certiorari, how these inmates
have had tb.oir day in court time and time and time again.

And

I submit that a review of this reveals that they have not been
denied access, -they have not been denied meaningful access, and
that these inmates have had more, than their day in court.,
I would further submit that this Court issue clear
instructions to the inferior federal courts that a rereading of
Johnson v. Avery is required, that the fountainhead case here
states that the; alternatives are required if there is a state
regulation prohibiting mutual legal assistance between inmates.
Thar© is no such prohibition in North Carolina, therefore the
requirement of Johnson v. Avery does not comma into play.
And oim must also read Ross v. Moffitt in conjunction
with Johnson v. Avery.

Th® state is not required to provide the

aarae arsenal to th» prisoners, the same legal resources as a
private citizen may obtain.
I

youId

further suggest that the case of Gilmore v.

Lynch be reread, because that court assumed, as many federal
ocnrfca have been assuming, that there is a definite obligation
to provide legal facilities.
Johnson.

The lower courts have misread

They have gone to step two, without aver seeing what

is required to reach step two.
QUESTION^

Well, a federal court might have to go to

21

step two if a stat®, as a matter of its state policy, said w®
are going to provide adequate law libraries to everybody in
custody in our prison system, and then proceeded to supply
adequate law 2i rarias to only one institution but not to any
of th® others, then the prisoners in those other institutions
would have an equal protection claim, wouldn3t they?

MR. SAFRON :

No question about it, Your Honor, there

would be equal, protection problems.

But. I would say fchiss

We

have a situation with 77 units in our state, covering 475
miles.

Most of these units, as the Fourth Circuit readily

acknowledges, are small, they are set in localities throughout

the state, so we can have work-release, so we can have studyrelease, so they can bs close to their families.

And. we will

have an incredible equal protection problem in the State of
North Carolina with these small units spread across the state.
It has been our intention to keep th© inmates close to home.
It has been our intention to let them b© where they could get

work-release jobs, study-release jobs.

And a situation like

this could be- counterproductive, because we would be forced,
flu© to fchfe shear expense of providing these facilities, which
are not available to the private citizen in th© streets, which
are not available to our judges, which are not available to
our DA's, and quite frankly our law library is the library of
th© Supreme Court of North Carolina, wa in th® Attorney
General's office, and just the two of us who handle these

22
multiplicity of cases, we don't have our own law library
facilities, we. us® the Supreme Court’s library at the suffranc©

of the Supreme Court of North Carolina.

They could enter an

order any day saying that it is just "for our own use," and —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY NAKELL, ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. NAKELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas© the

Courts
Youa.gesr v. Gilmora was decided unanimously by this
irt.

The decision was rendered after mature and thorough

consideration# and it was based on sound principles.
QUESTION:

Why do you say that?

MR. NAKELL:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I take it, whatever may be our authority

to rci-ciasamiae it, that the Fourth Circuit had no choice under
Hicks v. Miranda but to follow it?
MR. NAKELL:

That's correct, Your Honor, certainly.

And I think, that the Younger v. Gilmore case stands as a very
substantial precedent for this Court as well, because it was
decided not summarily but after complet® briefing and argument.
And indeed California, in its jurisdictional statement and in
its briefs, presented all of the arguments that North Carolina
has presented in this case, with the exception of the argument
based upon Ross - v. Moffitt.

MR. NAKELL:

If there were r&asonabXy competent fellow

tent fellow prisoners would also need law books in order to be

able to function in that role, and law books would still ba
necessary.

Well, they nay have them on their own.

MR. NAKELL:

Well, they may or may not.

They may --

QUESTION?

Johnson was talking about a prohibition of

availability, not an affirmative making availabl®.
MR. NAKE1L:

I agree, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

•'■.hut was what vrz& involved in Johnson v. Avery, and the Court
held on the narrow facts of that case that it was illegal for a
stat® — I believe it was Tennessee in that cas® — to prohibit
writ. writers without providing an alternative.

I pointed out

that the possible alternatives that the Court suggested that
i.r .

r.r m:dl.f ivy law ant -me. sardar, if it wanted to, to cut

out it:; writ writer system, did not include providing law
books, simply providing law books was not on© of the alterna­
tives , but providing para-legals —
QUESTION?

But in carder to get any benefit from

teter:©:.. v. Ivory in this cate, don't you first have to show
that North Carolina prohibits the availability of writ writers?
MR, KdKELls

Yeur Honor, I think that there — ye®,

the answer to that question is yes.

33

QUESTION:
MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION:

And have you made that showing?
No, Your Honor.

No.

So you don’t get any benefit from Johnson

v. Avery?
MR. NAKELL:

Well, we do because — wa don’t from

the specific holding of Johnson v. Avery.

Younger v. Gilmore

went a step beyond Johnson v. Avery in terms of its specific
holding.
QUESTION:

Well, you say Younger v. Gilmore went

beyond Johnson v. Avery, yet it is a one-sentence affirmance
and fch© only case that it cites on the merits is Johnson v.
Avery.
MR. NAKELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that was

appropriate because underlying the majority opinion in Johnson
v. Avery was the statement that a prisoner has the constitu­
tional right to help in regard to his access to the courts.
The majority said this, and Mr. Justice White# in his separata
opinion in dissent, elaborated even further on that and express
ly said that without some help, the prisoner is affectively
barred from access to the courts.

And on that rational®,

which was the rational© that supported the opinion in Johnson
v. Avery, I think th© court in Younger v. Gilmore was entitled
to rely.
QUESTION:

I gather that you do not challenge your

friend’s statement that as soon as this procedure gets under

34

way, counsel is provided for the prisoner.

Is that, correct?

Has h© correctly described it, in your view?
MR, NAKELL:

You mean as scon as a post-conviction

procedure gets under way?

No, I didn't understand him to

describe it that way.
QUESTION:

No, he said on the appeal, as soon as it

is denied.
MR. NAKELL:

Frankly, Mr. Chief Justice, I must say

that I have no independent knowledge of whether a prisoner who
is denied the right to proceed with a post-conviction
proceeding and. is denied counsel in that proceeding, he would
be provided counsel on appeal.
All I can say is I do not© that th© plan that the
State of North Carolina has submitted to LEAA assumed — at
page 3e. of my brief — assumed that in order to get counsel, a
prisoner would hav® to submit a petition which on its face has
some merit.

And also Judge Larkins — who is probably more

familiar titan I — in the District Court — with this
procedure — also said that,, like the federal courts, there is
no right to counsel in th© state post-conviction proceeding
unless counsel is appointed.

1 quite agree that the statute

seems to provide for it, but I understand Mr. Safron agreed
that it is not done at the trial level, where th® statute
seems to provide for it, and quit© frankly I don't consider
myself qualified to speak as to whether it is don® on appeal.

35
I had always assumed that it was not, and did not look to sa©
whether there is anything to the contrary, so I do not know
the answer to that.
But it is clear -that the' inmate receives no help in
the preparation of his petition at. the initial stage, and he
certainly receives no help at any point through the petition
unless the court decides to appoint counsel to represent him.
And let me say that this petition for certiorari is just what
it sounds like.

There is no right to appeal from fch® denial

of post-conviction writ in North Carolina.

It is a discretion­

ary review, arid therefore ©van if the application had sane
merit, the court may deny it for reasons that have nothing to
do with tht: intrinsic merit.
QUESTION:

Where do you go, th© intermediate court

of appeals?
MR. NAKELL:

The intermediate court of appeals, and

that is as far as you can go.

You can't go any higher than

that on a post-conviction proceeding.
QUESTION:

And is that decided by less than the full

number of th© judges of that court?
MR. NAKELL:

I am not sure of the answer to that.

They sit in panels, so I assume that it could be don© by a
majority of th© panels, but I quite frankly am not certain of
that.
QUESTION:

I know, but her® certiorari is granted on

3S
votes of four of the Ninth.

Is there ay tiling like that on

the —
MR. NAKELLs

No, not as far as I know, Your Honor,

not as far as I know.
QUESTIONS

Counsel, do you recall, going back to

Younger v. Gilmore for a minute, whether in that case th®
California system had a rul© against one writ writer helping
another prisoner?
MR. NAKELLs

It is clear, Mr. Justice Stevens, that

California did not.

In footnote one of its opinion of th®

three-judge court, it. stated that California did not prohibit
writ writers, and therefore I think on th© facts Younger v.
Gilmore is precisely th© same as this case.
QUESTION:

Wasn't th© holding in tha District Court

that at least California had to provide either decent legal
research facilities or lawyers or law students?
MR. NAKELLs
QUESTIONS

Tha District Court actually —
It didn't say that fellow inmates would

foe enough, did it?
MR. NAKELLs
correct, Your Honor.

The District Court ordered ■— that is
That is correct.

They did not consider

writ writers to fallow inmates to be enough.

In the circum­

stances of that case, where there was no evidence, it should
be taken into account

that, as in this case, there was no

evidence that the writ writers were adequate.

37
Now* I might point out* Mr. Justice Whit®* in re­
gard to your interest, about th® use of iratiafca writ writers
that th© plan submitted by th® state and approved by th©
District Court* and which is part of tbs order in this case*
does provide for th© training and usa of inmate para-legal
assistants.

I believe the plan provides for th® training and

use of about 21 of them.

In this way* the state would hav© a

way of guaranteeing or assuring that there are writ writers
available on the premises who would bs in. a position to assist
th© prisoners, and of course the plan is very carafully drawn
to 'take? account of th© nature of tbs North Carolina prison
system * the. far-flung nature of it, so that it provides that
only — libraries have to be provided in only seven of the
prisons* and the plan itself calls for an additional five cor©
libraries.

It also provides for a Xerox machine to b© avail­

able at th© Raleigh library* which will probably be in central
prison*

I assum©.
QUESTION?

Did you say that that plan was submitted

by the state?
MR. NAKELL:
Your Honor.

Submitted by the state* that is correct*

And quit© frankly, we found as to those aspects

of it that it was acceptable and we did not ask to hav© a law
library in every one of the SO or so prison units.

We ware

perfectly amenable to the reasonable compromise in terms of
th® number of libraries.

I might say that this is far lass

/

38

than many professional correctional administrator's have recom­
mended.

It. is far lass than the National Advisory Commission

recommended.
QUESTION:

Of course, you are talking about a con­

stitutional question and those recommendations have very little
if any relevance on what is a good policy as constituted with
what is constitutionally required.
MR. NAKELL:

I agraa with that, Your Honor.

To the

©stent that w© are concerned with the sxercise of discretion
or tli© ©sere is© of expert is© by the prison administrators, it.'
is helpful I think to look at what other prison administra­
tors have thought.
t

QUESTION:

How could you justify having any less

than the same scop® of library facilities in ©very institution
in the state?
i

MR. NAKELL:

Because, Mr. Chief Justice, the State

of North Carolina in its plan has made provision for being
able to assure; that all inmates have equal accass to th®
library facilities of th© seven prisons.
methods.

There are alt@rn.ativ©

Prisoners may be brought into the prison facilities

that have libraries, if they request the use of ©'library, and
may ba housed there overnight if necessary, according to th®
plan.
Moreover, 'there is provision for a Xerox machine to
be maintained at the central prison, at th® library in

39
Raleigh, wherever that, is ultimately situated, so that any
prisoner upon request could gat copies of specific cases if
it were possible to service his needs without providing him
the use of the entire library.

So that I believe it is very

possible, with the seven main libraries and the five core
libraries and the Xerox machine, that this can be implemented
in such a way that all prisoners in all institutions will
i

have equal access to the library facilities and will have
meaningful access to legal materials to assist them in their
constitutional right to access to the courts.
QUESTION:

What provision of the Constitution is it

that provides the right to law libraries for prisoners?
MR. MAXELL:
based

Well, Your Honor, I believe that it is

the right is not, as Mr, Justice White pointed out,

not strictly for law libraries but th® right is for some help
from the •—
QUESTION?
MR. MAXELL:

Well, what provision of the Constitution?
Wall, Your Honor, on different occasions

this Court has identified it as ensuing from the First Amend­
ment, right tc petition for redress of grievances, the due
process clause —
QUESTION:
MR. MAXELL:

What case was that?
Johnson v. Avery.

I believe that there

have been other authorities in which you have discussed it as
well.

I think the on© constitutional basis where this Court

40
has talked about it most recently is in Procunier v. Martinez,
where this Court identified the. due process clause as the
source of it.

Also, of course, in Younger v. Gilmore, both

the due process clausa and th© equal protection clause were
cited as th© constitutional source for the constitutional
right of prisoners’ access to the courts.
QUESTION:

In this Court's opinion?

MR. NAKELL:

Well, this Court did not specify.

Court’s opinion was vary brief.

This

But it was in the opinion of

tbs three-judge court.
QUESTION:

Would this right extend to the right of

inmates, the next step, wary inmate has a lawyer to interpret
the cases he finds in the law books for him?
MR. NAKELL:

No, Your Honor, I don’t believe -that

that would be necessary.

I think that what is required is

that th.® prisoner have a constitutional right to meaningful
access to the courts, and I believe that this is a flexible
standard.

In Ross v. Moffitt, this Court held that there was

no right to counsel for petitioning for discretionary review,
and discussed both due process and equal protection in th®
course of that opinion.

But due process, as th® Court pointed

out, is a concept of fairness, and fairness may b© flexible,
so that, whereas counsel will not be required, something lass,
something other than counsel might b@ required.

And I think

the decision in Ross v. Moffitt makes legal research

41
<{

facilities even more important.
QUESTION:

Well; what if an inmate comes into court

and says "I h&v© had a second-grade education; my IQ is 85.
It is true, the State of North Carolina furnishes a lot of law
books, but I simply am incapable of reading them and I am
being denied a right that others who are better able to read
the law books have, so I want a lawyer."
MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION:
MR. NAKELL:

Y@s.
What is your response to -that kind of -That certainly was the very special

concern of this Court when it decided Johnson v. Avery, where
it was the illiterate, non-educated inmate, and -the Court
there was specifically talking about his constitutional right
to help.

And Mr, Justice, Whit®, in his dissenting opinion,

expressed th© view that we shouldn't necessarily just allow
writ writers to operate and forbid the state from prohibiting
them, but wa should do something about providing this kind, of
help.
QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer to the question

does tee Constitution require the State of North Carolina to
furnish a lawyer to this particular person I hav© hypothesized
about?
MR. NAKELL:

Wall, here again, not necessarily a

lawyer, Your Honor, but something ©la®, and I think that the
provision in this plan for the training and use of about 21

42
inmat.© para-lagals would satisfy that requirement.
QUESTION:

You say that th® State of North Carolina

is constitutionally obligated to furnish him a trained para™
legal?
MR. NAKELL:

Is constitutionally ©bligatod to pro­

vide him scan© form of help, and it is up to th® state in th©
first instance to decide what the help should b®.
QUESTION:

Okay.

But is it or is it not obligated

to furnish him a qualified lawyer?
MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily.
Is it or is it not.obligated to furnish

him a trained para-legal?
MR. NAKELL:

Wall, 1 would think that something in

that area would be reasonable —
QUESTION:

Well, something in that area, what do you

mean by that?
MR. NAKELL:

Wall, my point in not addressing myself

specifically to what th© requirement is, Your Honor, is simply
that I want to emphasis© that the District Court in this case
took the position that the method of c crap lying with th© con­
stitutional requirement, was up to the state and left it to the
state, or as th® Court did in Younger v. Gilmore, to decide
exactly how to satisfy the constitutional requirement.

The

state may fine soma other road to do it.
QUESTION:

Wall, suppose this same question comes up

43
before Judge Larkins again. and we have this situation. I have
hypothesised to you»

Now, what is going to ba your answer

for petitioning the court or your answer if you are -the judge?
MR. RAKELbs

Hopefully, if the Court affirms the

order of the Court of Appeals, my answer would be that the

unless something els© —

And I would think that

trained, para-legals as a minimum would b© required, but there
may ba a way that the state could formulate to provide this
kind of help without doing that, and the matter would b© left
to the state to formulate, I think.
The District Court in this cas© did that, and I
think properly so, left it up to the state to formulate the

44
plan.

And the plan that w© have, for review now is the plan

submitted by the stat©.
QUESTION;

I might say with —

Pursuant to the District Court's require­

ment, is it. not?
MR. NAKELL:

Yes, of course.

Of course.

But cer­

tainly it is clear that the — my point is simply that th©
District Court and th® Court of Appeals did not themselves
undertake to make the decision, otherwise they made clear that
if the decision ware up to them, they would hav© provided
legal counsel.

I think they both gav© an indication that they

would find that to'be a preferable system.
I might point out that th© great success -- and
Younger v. Gilmore has bean a great success — and th© great
success that it has enjoyed, in my judgment, is due in large
part to the us® of trained inmate para-legals.

The literature

has shown that; the training program for inmate para-legals has
been very successful.

Indeed, 'bln© State of Michigan just

graduated its first class of inmate para-legals last week, with
a major graduation ceremony provided over by the Chief Justice
of th© Stata.

Those jurisdictions that have used inmate para­

legals have found them to b® very, very useful, and this in my
judgment is really the secret to why these programs have been
sc successful, and far more successful than wa would expect
law books alone to be, and people have been surprised by how
well inmate para-legals hav© functioned.

45
get his turn in the library for a day.

Writ writers are not

going to be able to flourish under that system any better
than they can under the present system? where & few people may
have access to the only and very, very limited legal informa­
tion that is available.

So there is nothing in this plan that

would facilitate the flourishing of inmate writ writers or the
development by them of a power base.
QUESTION:

Just to bo sura — and I want to nail

this down for my own purposes -- you are not attacking in any
way the constitutionality of the plan as submitted?
MR. NAKELLs

No, Your Honor, no.

We would be per­

fectly satisfied to have the Court approve the plan as it was
approved by the District Court

with minor modifications, and

by the Court of Appeals with one minor modification.

Ws

would, I might say, fo© very pleased' to entertain some sugges­

Let me interrupt there, sine© you referred

Would you also agree that the library facilities

would perhaps no longer b© constitutionally required if there
were an alternative program such as student lawyers of som©
kind or other outside the prison system giving this kind of

MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION:

I would agree.

I would agree.

And let m© ask you this also, while I

have interrupted you.

In the Younger case, as I remember it,

there was a --- the California system did allow some access by
the prisoners to the state law library, and it was challenged
as not being adequate.

Is that, tru© in North Carolina?

Do

the prisoners have any access to the state law library?
MR. NAKELL:
such.

No, there is no state law library as

There are law libraries at the Supreme Court and at the

state law schools and, as I understand, they may b© abl© to
get casas fran the libraries at the Supreme Court or the state
law library if they pay ten cents a page.
QUESTION:
MR. NAKELL:

I see.
I believe that is the going rat®, ten

cents a page„
QUESTION:

You have just responded that if this

alternative wore provided, then libraries would not be neces­
sary.

What if someone comas in and points out that in Fbretta

v. United States, I think it was, the Court held that ©very
individual has the right to represent himself, be his own
counsel, and we have such a person in the prisons as under
Forstfca, "I want to ba ray own counsel, therefore I must b©
furnished with all the facilities that I need, ©van though l

Well, first, Your Honor, w© ar© talking

about tli© North Carolina prison system, where people ar©
placed genarally -— there ar© a few people placed there pend­
ing trial, but generally people have already bean convicted at
this stage —
QUESTIONS

Some of them — I

am talking about if

Foretfca gives the parson th© right to represent himself in the
trial of a case, would it not follow as a matter of course
that he would b© entitled to represent himself in anything less
than the trial of a contested criminal case?
MR. NAKELLs
QUESTION:

Yes, I would assume so.
Then what happens to your answer to Mr.

Justies Stevens?
MR. NAKELL:

Well, Mr. Justice Stavens, of course,

raised the question of whether counsel is necessary or whether
counsel would be an adequate substituto.

If counsel ware pro™

vided and a prisoner did not want to take advantage of the
provision that was made, 1 think the obligation of the state
I

would be satisfied because th© obligation of the state is not
to do whatever is necessary in order to satisfy th© inmate,
taut is only to do whatever is necessary or reasonably neces­
sary in order to assure the inmate's access to th® courts.
Because a particular prisoner might prefer a different method
— and I can imagine prisoners ©van not in that situation,

48
prisoners who are in poet-conviction or 1983 actions or civil
rights actions in state court, who would prefer to have a
library rather than counsel.

The personal preference of the

inmate in that circumstance would not control, I think, it is
not a Foretta-type situation at all.

It is a situation in

which the state’s obligation is not to provide necessarily
counsel but is only to provide the means reasonably necesary
in order to insure the prisoner meaningful access to th®
courts.

That is a different standard than the standard that

applies in situations where th© inmate would b® entitled to
the right to counsel, and therefor© I don’t see any problem or
conflict in that particular circumstance,
I would like to say that the American Correctional
Association, in May of this year, a.development I learned
aibout since filing mv brief , cam© out with a statement of
responses to th® National Advisory Commission recommendations,
and they either accepted or rejected or modified the reccmmanc.tit ions, and they with regard to -the National Advisory Com­
mission recommendation for access to legal services, they
accepted that, which would provide for a library equivalent to
what is provided for in th© state’s plan in every prison with a
design capacity of 100 or mor®.
QUESTIONS

to

Of course, they are addressing themselves

the question ©£ policy and procedure, are they not, and not

the Constitution?

49
MR, NAKELL:

That is absolutely correct, Your Honor.

I just think that th® Court should ba informed about th®
opinions of professional correctional administrators, and
they —
QUESTION:

As far back as tan or twelve years ago,

son® of us were parties to a program that advocated and was
carried out; on a pilot basis circuit-riding lawyers, not law
students, circuit-riding lawyers who would periodically show
up at a prison t» help prisoners.

You wouldn't regard that as

a commitment on th® constitutional issue, would you?
MR. NAKELL:

No, Your Honor, just because it is

don® would not ba a commitment on th© constitutional issue.
But I think that it is important to note that, as Mr. Justice
Blackman brought out, I think, that even th© State of North
Carolina has taken the position that meaningful access to the
courts for prisoners requires that they be given access at
least to legal services.
tion.

This was in th© LEAA grant applica­

I understood Mr. Safron to characterize that as

puffing or as salesmanship or saying whatever was necessary to
get an LEAA grant.

And th® only question is whether th© state

would also say whatever is necessary in order to get an order
from this Court.
The state has taken th© position that this is neces­
sary and that it will have the collateral effects which have
been expressed in many other states, that is it has reduced

50

the number of frivolous petitions and has increased the
quality of petitions in all the other states that have imple™
merited this »
QUESTION;

I understand the state’s position, that

it is necessary because it was required by an action of the
District Court.

Isn’t that what they said to LEAA?

MR. NAKELLj
QUESTION;

Their grant application.
What?

MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION!

'

Their grant application.
Yes.

MR. NAKELL;
QUESTION;

'

That was the necessity for it.

Well, I assume —
Thar© would be filing without that de­

cision?
ms.

NAKELL:

Well, I can’t say that there would.

don’t agree with that.

I

But of course, their petition and

their brief in this case were necessitated by the same
District Court, order.
QUESTIONS

Wall, don’t w© have to consider it in that

light, their application to th® LEAA?
MR. NAKELL;
QUESTION:

Well, I think so.
We accept th® fact that, they mad© it after

th© court’s decision?
MR. NAKELL:
QUESTION;
MR. NAKELL:

That’s correct.

That’s right.

All right.
I think th® LEAA application, of course,

51
has another important factor that bears on our case, and that
is the state has represented that the cost factor of meeting
th© District Court's order, of masting the plan that -they
themselves proposed would require a distribution, a redistribu­
tion of services from something else -that th© Department of
Corrections is providing.
Th© LEM. application shows that th® state was plan­
ning all of tills time to apply to the federal government for
90 percent funding of the initial cost, 90 parcent funding of
the expenses for the first couple of years of th® program, and
that they have every reasonable expectation of being funded
in that way because LEM has funded other programs and indeed
has funded programs to greater sums of money, particularly
programs which have gone beyond Younger v. Gilmore and pro­
vided legal services to varying degrees, including many states
which have provided l®gal services in a comprehensive manner.
And ws just do not agree that th® State of California — th©
Stats of North Carolina, excuse me, in this case,, cannot
■afford to meet its prisoners' constitutional needs in this
respect.
On June 30, 1975, th© fiscal year ending then, th©
State of North Carolina — excuse me, my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you gentlemen.
