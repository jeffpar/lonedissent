P R OC ENDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 54 Original, the United States against Florida and
Texas.
Hr. Clyburn, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE C. CLYBURN, ESQ.,
'

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS
MR. CLYBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Lee Clyburn.
general of the State of Taxas.

I am an assistant attorney

However, for purposes of the

argument today, I will be representing the views of both the
States of Texas and Florida since there are no divergent or
independent views as to those two defendant states.
The issue before the Court today is whether the
defendants in this Original proceeding will be allowed to
file a counterclaim nominally against the United states of
America.
The Special Master has filed a report recommending
that the counterclaim not be filed because of the United
States’ Sovereign Immunity.

The defendant states urge this

Court to refuse to apply the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity
in the mechanical, uncritical manner advocated by the United
States and to grant leave to file this counterclaim so that
full justice may be done herein.

4
This is strictly a lawsuit for declaratory relief.
Tt was originally filed by the United States
against the states of Florida and Texas seeking a declaration
that neither defendant had any right to control fishing by
foreign vessels or their crews in the seas more than three
miles off their shores.
The states answered and opposed the United States8
request for declaratory relief.

The states each assert that

they do possess the right to enforce their laws at all points
within their boundaries, which boundaries in the case of
each of these two states extend three leagues or nine geo­
graphical miles into the Gulf of Mexico.
It became clear as discovery progressed in this
lawsuit that the United States' true position was, as the
they
Defendants state, not only did/not have any right to enforce
their laws outside of three miles, but indeed, the Defendant
States of Florida and Texas had no rights to enforce their
fisheries laws against foreign nationals, even in the threemile zone between the shore and three miles out where the
traditional territorial sea of the United States had been
locating.
Now, in order to clear up the whole question of the
respective rights of the parties with regards to this
important issue of offshore law enforcement rights, the
Defendants have filed their joint motion for leave to file

3

counterclaim.
By that counterclaim, the states seek only a
declaration by this Court that they do have the authority to
enforce their fisheries laws against foreign vessels and
their crews within three

miles from their shores.

United States opposes the filing of the counter­
claim, relying primarily upon the Doctrine of the United
States 1

Sovereign Immunity from suit The Special Master, in his report

filed with this

Court finds that the expeditious and orderly procedure in
this lawsuit v*7ould dictate the allowance of the filing of the
counterclaim but the Special Master felt that the decisions
of this Court required him to recommend that the counter­
claim not be allowed to even be filed because of the Doctrine
of Sovereign Immunity.
The Defendant States fully concur with the Special
Master's findings that, absent the issue of sovereign immunity,
the counterclaim should be allowed»

We strongly except, how­

ever, to the recommendation of the Special Master that the
counterclaim should be barred by operation of the Doctrine
of Sovereign Immunity.
No case known to the Defendants requires acceptance
of the United States5 position on this matter.
QUESTION;

Is there anything that Legislation passed

last October that has anything to do with the Doctrine of

6

Sovereign Immunity that Congress passed?
MR, CLYBURN:

Your Honor, we feel not.

understanding that the Solicitor General is

If is my

going to expli­

citly bring that statute ho the Court's attention for what­
ever bearing it might have.

I myself do not feel that it has

bearing on the issue today of whether the counterclaim
should be allowed.
We feel that only an absolutely uncritical adher­
ence to the most technical views of the position of the
Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in our country would require
or even allow the result urged by the United States.
On the other hand, the filing and adjudication of
the counterclaim would allow the entire disagreement between
the parties to be dealt with in this lawsuit and that full
justice could be done herein to all parties to this lawsuit
and not just to the United States.
QUESTION:

Xs there anything to the suggestion

that if your counterclaim is allowed, other states will be
implicated also?
HR. CLYBURN:

Mr. Justice Blackmon, it is true

that, the issue that we raised in our counterclaim would
probably be of interest to the other coastal states as well
as merely to our

two states that are defendants in this

lawsuit.
It is, however, our position that that should

7
certainly not stand in the way of the filings’ for the issue
is of very great importance to these states in this lawsuit
and it seems to us -- it seams to us almost incredible that
the United States would say that the counterclaim should not
be filed merely because other states9 legitimate interests
would be called into question by the counterclaim.
They have called it into question and now they
refuse to allow the issue to even be adjudicated.
QUESTION:

Well, you are not relying just on your

status as a counterclaimant.

You are saying that the other

states who might be implicated, along the lines of Mr. Justice
Blackmun's question, should also be allowed to intervene in
the proceedings'?
MR. CLYBUPN:

x really don't know what our position

would be if other states sought to intervene, your Honor.
don't.

I

What I am .saying is, is that it is of interest to us.

It is' legitimately raised in this lawsuit and we should be '
able to adjudicate it by counterclaim.
*

If other states sought, to intervene, the Court
would have to deal with that question and the United States
would have to respond to it at that time.
The United States in its brief to this Court makes
the following statement that clearly demonstrates what we
feel is the arrogance and unyielding nature of its position
and I quote from page 7 of their brief:

3

"In 3um, Defendants’ arguments that adjudication
of their counterclaim is imperative lest justice' be denied
misses the point."
Now, we point out to the Court that for reasons
best known to the Government, they saw fit to put the word
"Justice" in quotation marks in that passage from their brief
Be that as it may, it seems to the Defendants that
in this Court, inquiries into the justice and fairness of a
given result never miss the point.

To the contrary, that

inquiry — that inquiry as to what is fair and what is just should always be exactly the point and it is on that point
that the United States’ position completely fails.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that quote from the Govern­

ment’s brief largely based on our opinion last year in the
Testan case where we pretty much took the same position, that
it may be a more enlightened view that sovereign immunity be
abrogated but it is not up to this- Court to do- iti........
MR. CLYBURN;

Your Honor, they do cite the Court’s

opinion immediately after the quote that I read.

It is the

states’ position, however, that the cases cited, and all of
the cases, indeed, reported and relied upon for the applica­
tion of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity were cases that
are distinguishable from this one in effect, the possible
effect that the filing of fche suit or the counterclaim might
have on the United States.

9

In this lawsuit it is our position that the counter­
claim could have no adverse

effect or embarrassment to the

United States whatsoever.
QUESTION:

General Clyburn, might I ask you a
i

question on the nature of the conflict between the United
States and the two defendants within the three-mile limit?
Paragraph two of the motion for leave to file a
counterclaim contains the allegation that the United States,
through discovery, has denied the states authority to control
fishing by foreign vessels and their crews within the — in
the area within three miles seaward of their coastline.
MR. CLYBURN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Two questions.

Is there anything else

in the record shedding any light on the nature of the conflict
between the states and the government within the three-mile
limit?
MR. CLYBURN:

Yes, your Honor.

In our motion for

leave to file counterclaim we set out, and we quote from
answers to interrogatories and from deposition testimony
-wherein the United States does deny that right.
Is that response sufficient?
QUESTION:

Yes, I was wondering how -- it is in

response to interrogatories and the like that they say —
there has been no conflict in — is there anything in the
record to indicate that there is any conflict in the sense

10
that patrol vessels are arguing with one another about who
can make arrests or is there any actual physical conflict of
any

kind?
MR. CLYBURN:

your question is no.

Mr. Justice Stevens, the answer to
And the answer to your question is no

both as to the belt within three miles and as to the area
outside of three miles, at least as far as the State of Texas
is concerned and 1 would point out that we, the State of Texas,
has filed in its answer an allegation that no justiciable case
or controversy as to it exists and it is for precisely the
reason that there has not been any clashes between patrol boats
or the likes between the State of Texas and the United States
that we raise that point in defense of this lawsuit.
/

So the state's position in a nutshell is that there
is no justiciable CcU e or controversy as to Texas with regard
to, the United States1' original request for declaratory relief
QUESTION:

if you are right about that, there will

never be need for the counterclaim, will there?
MR. CLYBURN:

Absolutely, your Honor.

If the United

States' case is dismissed, we'll not be in a position or care to
pursue our counterclaim.
QUESTION:

Who — I perhaps should ask Mr. Sheehan ■-

what do you understand to foe the United States' theory with
respect to the area outside the three-mile zone?
MR. CLYBURN:

Well, your Honor, it is not clear in

11
my mind, to be honest with the Court, but it is my understan­
ding that
QUESTION;

You are claiming your right out to three

marine leagues?
MR. CLYBURN»
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

And what do you think their position is?

MR. CLYBURN:

As I can understand it

their posi­

tion is linked to the notion that the territorial sea of the
United Statas has traditionally been three miles and that
action beyond that could have implications that they say
would have more effect upon them than our actions within
three miles.
QUESTION;

If the difference, so if they deny your

right within three miles it is for a di ferent reason than
outside?

MR. CI»Y1

;k;x: Honor, 1 think I may

have not fc son plain in my tiswe;.:.

1 think their distinction

s. s ib1 ■: why they should -.
OlEhTIOK;

1

jusu wondering if the grounds

urged are different?
MR* CLYSUR'l:

Not really, your Honor.

I was confused in my earlier response.

Excuse me,

Apparently they don’t

think there is any difference in our rights within three miles?
and outside.

At least, that is what they said repeatedly in

the discovery that I have alleged, as 1' pointed out in my

12
brief.
QUESTION:

But you think both within and without

three miles their idea is that this has foreign relations
implications?
ME. CLYBURN:

Yes, sir.

That is correct.

That is

what I understand and what they are saying to us is that al­
though we feel that you don"i have it anywhere, just for
reasons best known to us we only want to let you litigate with
us right now on the area outside of three, between three and
nine.

That is what we don’t think is fair.
And examination of the effects of the filing of our

counterclaim —
QUESTION:

Did they draw a difference between

navigation and fishing?
MR. CLYBURN:

Fishing is the Only issue that they

raise in their lawsuit or that we mention in our counterclaim.
I think that the traditional law of the sea makes distinctions
between the rights of fishing and the rights of navigation.
QUESTION:

Do you, in terms of what your rights are?

MR. CLYBURN.

Yes.

Yes, your Honor.

For example,

we would never seek to prevent any —
QUESTION:

To exclude a foreign ship.

MR. CLYBURN:

Absolutely.

If it were engaged in

innocent passage and no one has ever alleged that we have or
want to.

13
QUESTION:

Qsneral Clyburn, let me just ask you

again, I-am a little pussled about the prejudice to the State
of Texas.

»

If you win, you won’t be hurt by not being able

to file a counterclaim.
MR. CLYBURN:

If we prevail on the merits of the

lawsuit?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLYBURN:

Probably not.

Probably not,

%

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Then it is up to the government.

And if

you lose, don’t you have two bites at the apple, in effect,
with regard to the area within three miles?
You have only lost in the area three to nine and
you still have all your arguments for within the three-mile

z one.
I have a little difficulty seeing «he prejudice.
UR. CLYBURN:

The prejudice, veur Honor, would come

in in, we feel, in various ways.

First

rot of ultimate

importance in this Court but a very real or.a to the states
would be that it would subject'us to the very real possibility
of a repeat litigation of a few years from now when they
decide to sue us on the inner bait.

That would be unfair.

More fundamentally — more fundamentally, were we
to lose on the merits of their original complaint and be
denied our right to file and litigate our counterclaim, we

14
would be in the position of not knowing whether we could
legitimately enforce our rights within three miles and -we
would be in a position of doino so at our peril of, at the
very least, having a lawsuit filed against us by the United
States when they chose to do so,
QUESTION:

But the peril —

QUESTION:

And addition to every single other

coastal state,
MR, CLYBURN:
QUESTION:

It would seem so.

That's right.

That would just proceed

along with every other coastal state except for Texas and

>

Florida in the Gulf, wouldn't it?
QUESTION:

Isn't that the same peril that has

existed for the last 100 years?
QUESTION:

For every coastal city.

MR. CLYBURN:

W@ don't think so, your Honor, because

to.my knowledge, the recent developments in this lawsuit have
been the first time the United States has come right out and
told us, wa don’t think you have any rights at all to enforce
your raws against foreign nationals anywhere offshore.
That is news to me and T think it is news to anyone
".fno learned about it so it is not — I just think in that
regard it would be a different situation.
The filing of the counterclaim cannot possibly have
any adverse effect upon the United states.

Not one penny of

15

monetary judgment brought against us by means of the counter­
claim.

We don’t seek to force them to deal in any particular

way with any federal property, to deed it to us or to deed it
to anybody else or to refrain from doing anything they want to
with any of their property.
Very significantly, we don't seek to have them
ousted from jurisdiction to enforce fisheries regulations at
any point anywhere on the face of the earth.
It is the position of the states and always has beer»
that the s cates and the Federal Government possess concurrent
jurisdiction within the entire belt to enforce their laws
against any violators.

»

We are not seeking to hurt the United

States.
X have already told you our view of the harm and
prejudice that would come to us and the basic unfairness of
letting the United States wave the banner of Sovereign
Immunity without even

attempting to give us or this Court or

anyone any logical reason as opposed to a dogmatic assertion
of it as a means of avoiding litigation of the full subject
matter that they have brought into issue by filing this lawsuit
QUESTION:

Is it possible to infer that you may have

raised the issue by asking certain questions on written
interrogatories and all?
HR. CLYBURN;

Well, your Honor, we are asking interro

gatories to get at the distinction they had raised in their

x6

lawsuit by assuming s.-

so.

outside of three.

We are asking

them to try to find out a logical basis, for their choice of
assuming it is only outside of three rather chan all the way
into the shore and it is in response that they said, you
don"t have any rights *
■ or the reasons tnat we have outlined, we urge the
Court not accept the United States1 dogmatic view of sovereign
immunity and to arrow the filing of this counterclaim so that
the furl issues

an he litigated in this lawsuit.

MR. SIIEEHAW:

'Che states have taken the position

that they do have those rights.

They assert that their

authority in this connection derives at least in part from the
.1963 Submerged Lands Act,

That Act, of course, granted to the

states rights in the natural resources within the territorial
sea, granted to all of the coastal states those rights in the
territorial

sea and as to the States of Texas and Florida, it

granted those rights out to a distance of nine miles in the
Gulf of Mexico.
The defendants states are, therefore, the only
states that can assert a claim of jurisdiction over foreign
vessoIs beyond the territorial sea on the basis of proprietary
interests granted by the Submerged Lands Act.

They are,

indeed, the only states that have asserted in this fashion
such a claim and they ere, accordingly, the only states named
by the United States as the defendants in this suit.
The counterclaim that the states would bring involves
rights in the three-mile territorial sea.

Those rights affect

the concern of every coastal state.
v,7e have objected to that counterclaim on grounds of
immunity„
Our argument proceeds in four steps.

First, that

the United States may not be sued without its consent.
Second, that, the rule applies with equal force when
the

plaintiff is a state.

1. w

n oy
j.

Third, that the United States has not consented to
this lawsuit by statute.
And, fourth, that it has not consented to this law­
suit by virtue of having initiated a complaint.
The first proposition needs, we think, very little
elaboration. As the Court stated last term in Tesfcan, it has
long been established, of course, that the United States as a
sovereign is immune from suit, save as it consents to be sued.
Likewise, the second proposition has established
beyond doubt in our view, the exemption of the United States
from being sued without its consent, extends to a state.
I think the last time this Court had occasion to
state that rule squarely was in Hawaii against Gordon in 373
United States Reports.
Our third proposition is that the United States by
statute has not consented to this suit and indeed, the states
have never claimed otherwise.
In this connection ? will raise the legislation
enacted last October by Congress and I am referring to the
waiver of immunity that Congress worked as an amendment to the
Administrative Procedure .Act.

Ue have included a copy of the

Amended Administrative Procedure Act as an appendix in our
reply brief in Matthews against Mister Sanders.
That waiver of immunity has no effect in this case,
which is not a suit to review agency actions brought under the

20
Administrative Procedure Act.
Another piece of legislation chat is not referred to
in the brief is the Act last year by Congress, the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act of 19YS,

By that Act? Congress

extended its exclusive fisheries jurisdiction to a limit of
200 miles from the coastline.
That Act leaves this lawsuit where it finds it.

In

Section 306 of the Act it says explicitly that nothing con­
tained in the Act snail have any impact, either to enlarge or
to diminish the jurisdictions of the states within their
boundaries.

That, of course, is the issue posed by the

United States5 complaint,

what is the jurisdiction of the

state within their boundaries in the three to nine-mile area?
Tne: 'e is a v .. ,,. /xsion tor suit in the Act extending
tae axclusi ve
to 200 mile a.

fisheries -jurisdiction of the Unite?; states oaf
That provision for suit does not contemplate

suits by st ates inasmuch as it provides for exclusive jurisdiction of cases or c. .ntroversies arising under the Act in

■?

i

District Court
Congress could not have contemplated that states
would sue under that provision inasmuch as the Constitutio;:,
giw, . this Court original although not exclusive jurisdiction
over actions in which a state may be a oartx?
That provision pursued also is of no aid to the states
in this case because it provides only for stilts in the district

21
court, not in the

supreme Court and finally, it is void to

the states because it does not take effect until March 1st,
1977.
Thus, the United States has not by any statute
consented to be sued in the manner that the states seek to do
and so the issue becomes whether the United States, by initia­
ting a lawsuit, consents to be sued.
QUESTION:

It clearly has not.

Do you have a case involving a counter­

claim against the Federal Government?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

justice.

Do you have a case involving a counter­

claim against the Federal Government and sovereign- .immunity?

And the

second is United States against United _^tates_Fidelity Company

There is, indeed, a third case, Nassau Smelting Works
acainst United States 266 United States Reports page 101.
read from that

I'll

I'll read one — two sentences from that case

"The objection to a suit against the United States
is fundamental, whether it be in the form of an original
action or a set-off or a counterclaim.

Jurisdiction in either

22
case does not exist unless there is specific Congressional
authority for it.1'

That is at page 6 of the Government's

response to the defendants8 exceptions to the Report of the
Special Master and the other two decisions that 1 have just
cited, Mr. Justice, the Shaw case and the Fide1ity Corporation
case!*are also mentioned in our brief.
QUESTION:

So you don’t think the point is home.

MR. SHEEHAN:
Mr. Justice.

Well, I do think the point is horne,

I will add only one statement.

QUESTION:

There is one —

Would ic be possible without this for the

Master to say that in deciding your case he not only decides
against you but. he goes a little step further?
He couldn't do that.
L mean, cor.Id he give him this relief without them
asking for it?
MR. SHEEHAN:

No.

The Special Master can decide the

United States' 'complaint without reaching any of the issues
posed by the counterclaim, in our view.
QUESTION:

Well, I am saying it does grant all that

the counterclaim asked for without the state asking for it.
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, to the degree that there is an

identity of issues, as the state asserts, between the subject
matter of its counterclaim and the subject matter of the
Government's complaint, then there is no necessity for the
counterclaim.

Is that what you are driving at, Mr. Justice?

23
QUESTION;

No. sir.

1 am saving chat they did not

file the counterclaim and the cane went to judgment and the
Special Master ruled against you and gave them the additional
relief which they had not even asked for.
Would that be wrong?
Would that bo a violation of the sovereignty?
MR. SHEEHAN:
would object and — no.

Well, I think that the United States
the United states — no, the Special

Master could not give -them the relief that they are asking for
in their counterclaim.

They are seeking a declaratory judgment

in their counterclaim.
\

If we were to lose our complaint, the result would
be that we would not be entitled to a declaratory judgment in
our favor.

The Court could not or the Special Master could not

in that case award a declaratory judgment that was.not asked
for .by the. state any .more .than .he could, award .any. affirmative,
belief on behalf of the state.
QUESTION:

But if you lose on the merits of the

claim that you asserted in your original complaint a fortiorari
you would, the merits of fci.s counterclaim would he decided
against you, wouidn*t it?
fou claim that tha state lias no power to regulate
fisheries between the three-mile limit and the three-league
limit, as I understand it.
MR. SHEEHAN;

is chat correct?

That is correct.

24
QUESTION:

And if —

MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

And if we lose —

And if the Master says,, and this Court

ultimately says, "Sorry, the state does have the power to
regulate the fisheries between the three miles and three
leagues," well, then, a fortiorari it would have power to
regulate fisheries within the three miles, would it not?
MR. SHEEHAN:

I think that it would, at the very

least, be very strong precedent against the subject suit by
the United States.
QUESTION:

That is true,, yes.

MR. SHEEHAN:

3

That is certainly true.

If there are r,.o questions, vbafc is all I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT 01 SYDNEY H. MCKENZIE, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS
XN REBUTTAL
MR. MC KENZIE:

Mr'. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
If, in fact, sovereign immunity is, as the Federal
Government asserts, absolute but for statutory waiver, then,
indeed, we probably do lack the right to assert this counter­
claim.
If, however, as we submit, and as we have submitted

25
in our memoranda, the Thekla case decided by this Court does
open the door, even a crack, to counterclaims in order to
completely determine an issue where the Federal Government
enters into litigation and where there is no danger to the
public interest and this is a most appropriate case to apply
that doctrine in Thekla.
In that case, this Court asserted, "The reasons that
have prevailed against creating a government liability in
tort do not apply to a case like this and, on the other hand,
the reasons are strong for not obstructing the application of
natural justice against the government by technical formulas
when justice can be done without endangering any public
interest.18

MR. MC KEN2IE;

Your Honor, I submit that what the

Shaw case did was simply state that this was not -- that, the
Thekla should not be interpreted' as throwing the gates open
wide to counterclaims against the Federal Government and I
don’t think it does and C don't think the language of it should
ba interpreted as doing so.
I don't believe that it did limit it to the — it

26

distinguished it on the grounds that it involved a libel
involving vessels but in distinguishing it on that, factual
basis, it simply said that the case does not throw the gates
open to counterclaims.
1

don’t submit that it does throw the gates open to

counterclaims.
Except, well, except this one as one unique circum­
stance, your Honor, and it is unique.
QUESTION:

Well, what limits would you put on this?

MR. MC KENSIE:

I would put on it the limits of a

counterclaim which, one, doesn't involve the expenditure of
public funds.

Two, doesn't involve an assertion of a right

regarding federal property and three, doesn't interfere with
public administration.
QUESTION:

What if the United States says ir&aintor-

feres with our control of foreign affairs?
MR. MC KENZIE:

What if they say it involves

of foreign affairs?
MR. MC KENZIEi
your Honor.

Well, but that isn't what they said,

understand the government’s theory is with respect to the area
between three miles and nine marine leagues?

Nine marine
9

miles„
MR. MC KEN2IE:

Well, unfortunately, their arguments

in their brief and their arguments, their statements by State
Department officials run somewhere nonparallel to each other.
In their briefs they argue that really, the reason
you don’t want to bother with this is because if somebody
comes in within the nine miles — within three leagues,, they
are likely to be stopped by the Federal Government out there
and they are not likely to come within three miles so it is
not an issue that we should be bothered

with at this time.

Their position there really one of, in effect,
saying it isn't going to make any difference in foreign affairs.
On the other hand, the State Department officials
who responded to interrogatories simply said that it is fcheiz
understanding that the Federal Government has absolute and uni­
lateral control over foreign nationals fishing in Florida,
waters or any other waters.
I submit that it is really on the basis of, in part,
federalism that we come before this Court.
They have argued that — in their argument on insti­
tuting the original suit that within the three-mile to threeleague area, that they should, that it is imperative that this
Court decide the issue and that they file their complaint, the

23
reason being that if we arrest a foreign national in that
three-league -—■ three-mile area, that it may cause this Court
to be faced with a situation

or cause the Federal Govern­

ment to be faced with a case where we have embarrassed the
Federal Government in its international policy by arresting
foreign nationals that they don't feel we should arrest.
However —

to be sale for that?

Well,, don't you think there is something
If any one of a half a dozen or more

states is free to go cut and put grappling hooks on a Russian
fishing boat or a Panamanian or whatever and pull them into
the shore and hold the crew in custody?
MR. MC KEN?IEs

Absolutely, vour Honor, and that is

exactly our point in bringing this counterclaim.

What is

true between three miles and three leagues is just as true
between the coastline and three miles.
QUESTION:
controversy.

If we can

it axl goes to the merits of this

We are uoc here involved with that, are we?

HR, MC KEN2IB:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, your Honor?

Ail these things go to the merits,of

whether or not yea are right, or wrong on the merits.
MR. MC KENZIE:

In order no determine whether we

11 within what we feel is the exception to the rule, to the
absolute prohibition against counterclaims as expressed in
t.o.e Tnekla case, I think you have to address the merits of our

29
relief, what relief are we seeking?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MCKENZIE:

We are seeking a pure declaratory \

*

judgment.

We are not seeking the ~~ if the declaratory judg­

ment was decided, the limitations of the relief would foe. if
there were any limi-cations, it would foe limitations on the
states, not limitations on the Federal Government.
We recognize the Federal Government has concurrent
power to exercise police power within this area so that no
decision would be made limiting the Federal Government's police
power, no monetary decision would foe made against the Federal
Government, no limitation of their administrative powers would
be asserted, no embarrassment would coma to the Federal
Government as in some other cases.
This is a peculiar, unique case where the states of
Florida and Texas, need, an.answer, , They. need, an answer to an

issue that, in basics, was raised originally by the Federal
Government.

That is tho basis of our coining into Court,

That

is the basis of our seeking this litigation.
■la would bo placed in a position where, even though
a partial addressing of the issue had been made, where we
wouldn't he able to properly direct our people as to what to
do or not to do and they have indicated to me that they — yea,
your Honor?
QUESTION;

Is it not possible that the Master and,

30
presumably, this Court»may accept the report, would rule that
the same rule of law applies within the three-mile limit as
applies between the three-miles and the nine-mile limit?
And if he doss, then won't you get your answer when
this case is all over?
MR. MC KENZIE:
that would be true

Your Honor, of course, something like

in any case where there was a possibility

of a counterclaim that a court might go beyond the declaratory
relief of the original action but the result would be that by
relying on happenstance and chance in that way, the positions
of the parties would not be set forth for the benefit of the

D

Master or for the benefit of this Court.
QUESTION:

The only thing that you are really

worried about is that if the Court rules with the Government,
you cant even file a new suit because of Sovereign Immunity.
MR. MC KENZIE:
matter of these things.

Well, that is why I say it is a
Of course that is what we are

QUESTION:

wreron'v. you considering filing this suit

before the federal Government did?
MR. MC KENZIE:

Weren't we considering filing it?

Yes, and found out you could not.

So you

waited.
MR. MC KENZIE:
your Honor.

Not to the best of my knowledge,

QUESTION:

That is not far from correct.

MR t, MC KEN £ IE:

Oar people were'-- our people were

asserting their rights quite unequivocally and I think that
is what inspired the Federal Government to bring this suit.
QUESTION:

But the point is that right now, if

Federal Government withdraws its suit.
MR. MC KENZIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

So will your counterclaim

MR. MC KEN2IE:

be gone.

If they ware to — yes, I am saying

that if the issue should be —
QUESTIONS

So the only way you have got a counter­

claim is because they filed a suit.
MR. MC KENZIE s

fnd that is exactly the language

of the Thekla, where they said, "It is said that there is no
statute by which the government accepts this liability.

It

joined in the suit and that carried with it acceptance of
whatever liability the courts may decide to be reasonably
incident to that act,”
that we are asking is that if the Court decides that
this is a suit that

should be brought, if the issue of police

power in the adjacent coastal waters is a proper issue to be
before this Court, then it makes no sense to decide half the
issue, that it is appropriate without any exposure to the
Federal Government for the Master and this Court to decide the
entire issue; that it .La appropriate that it comes within all

32

adoptions of judicial expediency, one of which was a point
which was raised by the Justice Department in an earlier case
today, that multiple litigation is something that they abhor»
and I suggest that if they

abhorred it in that case,

that it is appropriate for this Court to abhore it in this
case»
