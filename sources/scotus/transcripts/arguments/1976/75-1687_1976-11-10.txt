MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in 1687,, United States Trust against the State of New- Jersey.
Mr.Milburn, I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEVF.REUX MI LB URN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MILBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes from the Superior Court, Bergen
County, New Jersey, a decision hv Judge Gelman, appealed
directly to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, affirmed largely
on the opinion of Judge Gelman.
We filed a Jurisdictional Statement with this Court.
Probable jurisdiction was noted. And here we are.
Let me say at the beginning, before I start the
statement of facts, we have a stipulation among counsel of
387 pages plus exhibits.

All the briefs, at least half are

devoted to facts, and they are lengthy, according to the new
standards, too lengthy.
However, I would like to very briefly review the
facts,

I would then like to discuss 'the question of

emergency as it applies to the impairment of contracts.

I

would then like to discuss the reliance of bond holders upon
the 1962 covenant, and then the protection afforded to bond

4
holders by the .1962 covenant.
The facts, very briefly, are that subject — or after
the report of a commission in 1921, a compact was entered into
between New Jersey and New York, establishing the Port
Authority *
In 1922 a comprehensive plan was adopted.

Both of

those had the consent of Congress.
In the comprehensive plan, I think without question,
there was no mention of passenger traffic. The Port Authority
was conceived to handle the freight problem in the Port
District.
Things went along quietly until about 1927, and
legislation was passed requiring the Port Authority to take
over the passenger mass transit, problem.

This legislation was

vetoed by Governor Smith, and I might add that Governor Smith
was an architect of the compact and of the comprehensive
plan, and he pointed out in his veto message -that the moving
of freight was the primary -- I won't say the sole, but -the
primary and most important job for the Port Authority, and the
one for which they were created.
The Port Authority thrived, although the mass transit
problem was chronic.
In 1959 there was a legislative finding out of a
Joint Assembly Committee of the Hew Jersey Legislature.
I would call vour attention to page 16 of Appellees

5
Brief and page 7 of our Reply Brief — page 7 of our Reply
Brief sets out this finding a little more completely , shall we
say, than the brief of appellees»
QUESTION;

Did you say page 16?

MRa MILBURN:

Page 7 of our Reply Brief? page 16

of Appellees Brieft the blue one# and 7 of ours*
It says that''no doubt the Port Authority could under-'
take an activity which would involve a deficit, even a permanent
one"-- and if you're reading the Appellees Brief, that's where
it stops, with a period*
But I would like to just continue what's in our brief*
uXt could only do so if 'there were real assurance that the sise
of the deficit would be such that there could be no doubt of
its ability to absorb it*’

An important addition*

Now, nothing came of that.

But in 1959, there were

rumblings about the H&M, the Hudson tube *

The rumblings were

such that -- were caused by the fact that a district court had
just decided that the Hudson tubes could continue, and gave
them enough cash for two years *
It was obvious that something had to be done, and
the Port Authority was looked to, and it was suggested to them*
Now, the Port Authority was not unused to deficits*
Ever since 1931, and the General Reserve Fund, the Port
Authority had gone on a pooling basis*

It took its revenues

and it took its deficits and it mixed them all together*

6

But we are talking about deficite? — let me point
out that, for instance, that 1» 1362 the biggest deficit we’re
talking about was $500,000 for the Newark Airport.
Now, all these deficits cam© from facilities which
were expected to make money, and most of them did.

It took a

long time for some of them, but they all, with on® or two minor
exceptions, mad© money, and the major deficit in 1962 was
$529,000.
So along comes the H£M, and what is its projected
deficit?

$5 million,

h completely different ballgam®.

Now, $5 million was expected to level at $6,725,000
over a period of time.

There are two fallacies.

It didn't

level out at $6 million, it leveled out, well, to take 1973,
at $18 million operating deficit plus seven or more million
dollars debt service, or 25 to 28 million dollars.
Now, that is important, because it shows how wrong
people can be when they project deficits.

And, as you will

see, that becomes very important later.
QUESTION:

Nothing unique about that in public

enterprise, is there?
MR. MILBUHN:

No, sir.

You are right. And it still

goes on, and will.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. MILBUHN:

Now, with this deficit looking the

investors in the face, a new deficit, a completely different

7
concept of $5 million to $6 million, we are told that that ogre,
Austin Tobin went out and beat up investment concern,,

I don't,

think you have to best up investment concern when this type of
operation, which you're not used to and which you don't want,
is face-to-face with you,
Mow, the 1962 covenant isn't very long, but what it
provides is that if you take over —
QUESTION;

Excuse me, Mr, Milbum, you mentioned Mr.

Tobin, Was this after his retirement or —
MR. MILBURN;

No, sir.

This is 1961, when he was

beating up the investor concern for that $6 million deficito
The 1962 covenant, basically what it said was you
talc© the H&M mid you don’t have to take any more railroad
deficits.

There were limitations, but we have all agreed that

because of the PATH deficit, of the moment, there’s no room for
any more mass transit enterprises, because they are all
deficit, and we have used up the limitations which were
contained in the covenant.
Th© covenant was passed, the investments were made,
and things were quiet ’until 1971 and $1.2 billion worth of
bonds was sold during that period with the covenant in effect.
In 1971 there was a hearing on our sain© old favorite
subject;

Can the Port take over mass transit?
In 1972, there were further hearings, and New York

repealed the covenant, and Governor Rockefeller signed it»

8
This was too much for New Jersey..

They thought that it was

an unconsfeikutionaX act- and they, would not go along.
In 1973. we have more hearings, and finally, what
happened was, there was a prospective repeal of the covenant,
because it was thought that a retroactive appeal would be
unconstifcufeionai.
Included in that legislation was the original PATH
Tranford Kennedy-New York link.
Now, in 1974, the covenant was repealed without any
further legislative hearing.

We can guess why it was repealed,

and we can guess right or w© can guess wrong? we do not know
why it was repealed.
We do know tills,, however.

Built into the covenant

there is a provision for changing it, for modifying it, and
that provision calls for the consent of two-thirds of the bond
holders.

This may sound like a difficult proposition, but I

might remind the Court that it was done in the Triborough Bridge
Authority case, where the bond holders consented, they got an
extra quarter of a point, and they put out something like
$305 million which was applied to mass transit.
No effort was made to contact the bond holders.

I

understand it would be absolutely impossible tc contact them,
but I have to tell you that I understand that from Dean Severn
and from nobody else.
I do not know why they didn't try? I know they didn’t;

9
try.
Now, we have heard,, we have read in trie briefs, a
great deal about $40 million which is going to be realised,
from an. increase in the fares over Port Authority facilities,
Georg© Washington Bridge in particular? they were doubled.
We are not sure that they are going to stay double, because
of the Bridge Act of 1906, and because there are hearings, and
because there is a certain amount of litigation. But, right at
the moment, they are double.

And it is anticipated if they

hold, they will give out $40 million.
We are told by Appellees tills $40 million will go to
mass transit.

It said it was going to mass transit in toe

paraphernalia that went along with the toll raise.
m© ask you this s

How can it go to mass transit?

But, let
It belongs

to the bond holders, under the rate schedule, under the rate
agreement.
It doesn't just go $40 million to mass transit, it
goes into the pot; and what does that mean?

It means that

between 1974 and 1975, 'the surplus of the Port Authority, after
a mandatory provision for tha retirement of two years’ debt
service, amounted to $296,000.
Where did the 40 million go?
expenses of the Port Authority.
w©’r© talking about,

It went to increased

There is no $40 million that

That goes into the bond holders‘ pot,

and what came out was $296*000.

10
If there1 s an overflow from it or a flow-fell rough of
the $0 million, it can go to mass transit.

But the flow-through

we're talking about is $296*000, which does not build much
mass transit.
QUESTION;

Hr, Milburn, has the covenant bean

repealed by New York, too?
MR. MILBUHN:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir? it had to be.
So both States have don© it?

MR. MILBUHN;

By State action, yes, sir.

They did

it both in the — I believe in 1974, months apart.
QUESTION:

Was the New York repeal ever litigated

in the New York courts?
MR. MILBURN:

It is being litigated in the New York

courts.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. MILBUHN;

That's still not decided,

There has been a complaint and an

answer* and a lot of papers prepared, but if you ask m® why we
haven't proceeded immediately* I will give you the answer;
It is that we are waiting for the Flushing Bank case to com.®
down from the Court of Appeals of New York,

The argument was

September 8fch? we haven't, had the decision.

And* I have to

confess, I'm surprised we haven't had it.

But, depending on

that, or certainly using that in our papers* we will proceed
in New York —
QUESTION:

What* -3 the issue there?

ii
MR. MILBURN:

Big Mac — the New York notes; the

New York notes, were extended, and somebody sued, and it’s
before the Court of Appeals in New York.
QUESTION: What’s the market for Port Authority
bonds now?

Has it been affected by this repeal?
MR. MILBURN: The effect on the market was for a

period of eight months.

There was a very decided drop, and

we used the mass ports as a comparison, and it showed a
decided drop for eight months, and then a basic return and
leveling off.
I can say in -feliat connection that prior to repeal —
QUESTION:

A leveling off at what?

MR, MILBURN? At about the same as ?»- same spread.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. MILBURN:

Prior to repeal- the Port Authorities

in New York were © much finer bond than Mass Ports.

After

repeal» they have never been a finer bond -than Mass Ports.
Now- I have to admit that when we picked Mass Porte,
we picked a lemon. But it was fin® for that short period, after
repeal.
But, all of a sudden, Mass Ports got mixed up in
political controversy in Massachusetts, where the Governor
tried to take over the Commissioners and male® their term
coterminus with his, and, in other words, it became a political
football? and that affected the market, the banks blew a fuse,

12
if you will* and just complained.
market reacted accordingly.

And the market* their

So we picked the wrong one.

We

did not predict that.
But during — before that and during the eight-month
period there was a decided drop in the secondary market.
Now,toe admit that "the States have a. never-abdicated
police power.

We've read that time and time again, and we

admit it's there.

Take lotteries* prohibition, things like

that* sure —
QUESTION: Even with respect to its own obligations?
MR. MILBURN:

Even — well* may I say this:

I do

not admit that there has ever been a case where a contract* in
the form of a statute* mad® by a State or two sovereign States
with its creditors, made to induce investment* bargained for
and relied upon* has ever been repudiated and sustained in -the
courts.
QUESTION:

Well* you could add a few more facts and

just describe this case?
MR. MILBIJRN:
QUESTION:

I almost did* I think.

Yes* -chat’s what I thought.

MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

Yes. I might have missed ~~
But even — you wouldn't say there's any

per se rule against a State exercising its police powers with
respect to its own obligation?
MR. MILBURN:

Per se?

No.

I think that there ~ it

13
is possible- that oircusnatenrcse cc-uld exist «here the State can
do anything.
QUESTION:

But you think this case is —

MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

This case , I think, is —

— is distinguishable from any cases

that approved a modification, such as El Paso or something?
MR. MILBURN? I do, sir.

And would you like to

discuss it now or
QUESTION:
MR. MILBURNz
QUESTION:
MR. MILBURN:

No, no, I just wanted *—
-— should we bring in the law -Well, you go about it in your own —
Well, we're going to discuss HI Paso,

Mr. Justice White, as you can imagine.
QU33STION:

Mr. Mi lb urn,

being on the creditors and

all, but how long has Holland Tunnel been paid for?

Didn’t

they make an agreement on that -that when it was paid for it
would be free.
MR. MILBURN;

[Laughing].

No, sir.

That's part

of our pool.
[Laughter. 3
MR. MILBURN:

That takes care of some of the deficits,

including PATH, sir.
.As a matter of fact, the Holland Tunnel was thrown in.
to raak® the pool work.

Because, at the time, everybody was

going busted, around 1931 and ’32, including the Port Authority

14
and the pool wasn’t working because there was a deficit pool,
and the State put in the Holland Tunnel,, and that brought it
up over,

And that’s one of ■ our pride and joys, that and the

George Washington Bridge, as you know.
Now, what

justifies the use of the police power?

In such a case as we have here, if it can be
justified —- and I say that Blais dell and its progeny established
that it must be an emergency.
Now, Biaisdell had a real emergency.

They had mobs

in the Middle West, They had —
QUESTIONs

You mean something like the Minnesota

Mortgage moratorium?
MR. MI LB URNs

This was it, yes.

That was the

statute in Blaisdell, and there were riots and there were mobs,
and something had to be done. The statute was passed, and Mr.
Justice Hughes’ opinion in that case refers again and again and
again to emergency.

He also refers to temporary.

Now, the Appellees say, in their case, that an
emergency is not necessary.
so held.

No case that I can find has ever

Gelfert doesn’t, which is cited by Appellees.

In Gelfert, the contract was not. covered by the
?
contract clause, and that was a result of Honeyman v. Jacobs.
But then they tried to say, because there is no emergency
declared, therefore the police power doesn’t work, therefore
you’re covered by the contract clause.

And the Court said

15
nothing doing.

If you weren't covered under Honeyraan v.

Jacobs# just because there’s no emergency# we5 re not going to
slip you in under that coverage.
So -the fact, that there was no emergency declared
didn't help Gelfert# because it wasn’t covered by the contract
clause? you don’t have a conflict between police power and the
contract clause in Gelfert.
In the other case, the name I might have difficulty
pronoucing it, but. it’s Vi ex, there was an emergency, but I
think the attention is directed in that case against the word
"temporary".
Now# Mr. Justice Hughes used "temporary’'

all the

way through his decision in Blaisdell. ■ But here the Court
said you had a serious crisis# you had an emergency# you passed
permanent legislation.

Now let’s take a look at it.

And they took a look at it and they said that
situation still axisfcs.

You’ve still got withdrawals from

your savings and loan# your insurance companies ought to be
controlled# we’re not going to strike down that# because it
isn’t temporary# wa are going to permit permanent legislation#
because the facts that gave rise to the emergency are still
there.
Nov/# why do Appellees claim that there doesn't have
to be an emergency?

In my opinion# it’s because they have got

a very poor emergency.

And it would be nice if you could say

16
they didn't have to have one, because they've got two that —the Legislature didn't consider them, as far as we know? maybe
they did. But, as far as we know, as far as there is any
legislative history, the

Legislature did not talk about

energy, the Legislature did not talk .about ‘the environment,
and neither did Governor* Byrne and neither did Governor Wilson.
QUESTION: What did they talk about?
MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION;

Nothing.
Well, they roust have ~ tills wasn't just

a thoughtless thing, I don't, suppose — or was it?
MR. MILBURN:

As far as the record shows, Mr.

Justice Whit®, it was completely thoughtless.
Nov?, there might have been thought.
QUESTION;

Now, you would like to -- I know you

would like to say it was that, and they would like to say there*
was an emergency.
MR. MILBURN;

That is exactly right.

But I don't

know where it ■—
QUESTION:

But is there any evidence at all?

MR. MILBURN;

No.

If you're talking about energy, and if you’re talking
about environment

if you say that -there was an energy crisis;,

we admit that, we all tried to gat gasoline? there was one.
But they didn't mention it. They did not tie their legislation
to the ---

17
QUESTION: Well, perhaps at the minimum you could say
their object was to achieve what the repeal of the covenant
would achieve, which was what?
MR» MI.LB URN s

They — as far as we know, the object

was to put the Port Authority into mass transit.
QUESTION: Well, that's —
MR. MILBURN:

And the mass transit *— mass transit is

going to, some day, is going to have an effect on the environ­
ment and it’s going to have an effect on energy»
QUESTION:

Did you say, Mr. Milbum, to put the Port

Authority winto** mass transit?
MR. MILBURN: Well, let's reverse that:
transit into the Port Authority.
QUESTION:

put mass

That’s even worse.

Because under the covenant, mass transit

would mean more deficits, and -the covenant would prevent more
debts.

r
MRo MILRURN:

Absolutely.

Look, the covenant basically said no more railroads,
no more mass transit; because it’s all deficit, and, we agree
with you, you’re not going to put it in.
So that’s what the covenant said»
So there’s the stumbling block, there's no question
about that.
QUESTION:
mass transit?

So — well, was there an emergency about

I guess you would say there isn’t any more than

18
there always had been?
MR. MILBURN:

Well, I qo back to 1921, if you’d likef

and com® all the way through, there’s always been an emergency
-— well, why use that word?

Because I don’t think it’s as

chronic a.situafcion.
An emergency to me is a house on fire.
QUESTION:

And it’s precisely the -- precisely the

object of the covenant*
MR* MILBURN:

Precisely0

It was to stop it, and get.

the investors to put the money in to buy the H&M, which is
mass transit. and it’s a beautiful piece of mass transit,
including -~
QUESTION:

But the covenant said this is one

emergency that we won’t take care of in the Port Authority»
That’s what the covenant said.
MR. MILBURN: The covenant said what?
QUESTION;

If you call mass transit an emergency,

you could say that the covenant said this is one emergency that,
th® Port Authority won’t take care of?
MR» MILBURN;

If you call it an emergency, yes.

They’re not going to take care of it because of the
covenant.

No matter what you call it»

The covenant is there*

Now, w® say, because of the lack of legislative
history, because wa don’t really basically know what "emergency53
was, — what the emergency was, we would have to say that we

19
don! ••• chink that this legislation was based on an emergency,
and if it was# we don't think this is the way to handle the
situation.
If you came around a corner# you were the mayor of
the town# and you see a house on fire, what are you going to
do?

You will put it out.

You're not going to go to your

desk and draft legislation to get a new fire department# which
is going to come into existence ten years from now# and put
the next fire out*

The emergency is — an emergency to us is

something immediate.
And here we have a drop in the bucket# even when it
works# all the Port Authority could do is a drop in the bucket
of the transit problem on the Eastern Seaboard.
QUESTION;

Suppose you don't — suppose you just

don’t go at it. by labels# and you just say —• and say that
the real inquiry is the significance of the interest of the
State in achieving what they are trying to achieve by the
repeal of the covenant?
MR. MILBURN;

If you say that that is the interest

of the state?
QUESTION; Say that# instead of calling it an
emergency# instead of asking whether there's an emergency#
shouldn't you ask how important are the interests cf the
State that seem to justify the action?
MR. MILBURN;

I think you can ask how important the

20
interest of the State is, and the interest of the state in mass,
transit is extraordinarily important.
I night add here, and we’ve developed it in our
brief to some extent, there are lots of other ways to do it.
And -the worst way, in our opinion, that you can possibly do it
is to break your word to the creditors that you induced to
invest in the bonds of Port Authority, and because you have an
interest in mass transit

and God knows, there are lots of

other ways you can get that money; and there are lots of other
ways you can cut down on automobiles.
I merely mention World War II, they cut down on
automobiles, they cut down on the use of gasoline.
got an emergency, you can handle it.

If you've

But you do not handle it

by going out and breaking your solemn word to investors who
have invested $1.2 billion while that covenant was in effect,
on reliance on the States that they were not going to repeal
it.
So much for emergency and the basis for the State's
action.
In 1962

from 1962 to 1974, the covenant was sun

integral part of the bond holders’ contract.

It was contained

in every official statement.
QUESTION;

Mr. Milburn, before you use all your time,

will you be sure and discuss El Paso?
case.

Develop the El Paso

21

MR, Ml LB URN;

1 «fas going to ask for tine to rebut,

but let rae discuss HI Paso, and maybe I can ~
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think, under the circum­

stances, we'll enlarge the time of each side five minutes? so
you can take that into account,
MRo MI LB URN:

Thank you, sir.

Just to finish reliance — well, I won't finish
reliance, I’ll come back to reliance.
And let us go to El_ Paso,
I am sure that everyone here is familiar with the
facts of that case, and the decision in it.

I have established

here, I hop©, that the covenant induced investors to put their
money into the Port Authority.

There was no inducement in

El Paso,
El Paso — the people that were hurt by El Paso we're
defaulters.

The plaintiff or the petitioner was a rank

speculator.

He had, in that statute, an unbargained-for

benefit.

If he had any bona fide interest in the piece of

land in which he owned an interest, he had five years, after
the passage of the new statute, within which -to come up with
the money to stop being a defaulter and to own the land.
QUESTION:

Why do you call his interest an

unbargained-for. one?
MR, MILBURN:

He bought the land — he didn’t buy the

land; when he bought it the statute was in -affect.

22

Now, in our case, we bargained for the statute,
said, v?e' II give you the money, but you do this,
at that time, in 1962,
State, and said:

We

In person,

The investment community talked to the

You do this, we’ll do that, and the H&M

will run.

...
But this fellow didn’t have any bargaining with the

statute — with the Legislature that passed this statute.
And that’s an important difference»
Nov;, as Hr. Justice White said, five years is a
pretty fair deal for anybody, any defaulter who really wants
his land.

It gave him five years to come up with the money,

and he could keep it.
This statute was directed against the defaulters,
the speculators who wer® in there, and it was a case to quiet
a land problem in the State of Texas.
Now, I can — in my opinion, this Court never dreamt
•that the El Pago case, dealing as it did with defaulters and
speculators, would be brought out and used as a binding
precedence in a case such as this, where the creditors of a
State dealt with the State, bargained for a deal with the
State, and then it was repudiated — abrogated, not modified;
abrogated completely.
Now, in El Paso it was modified, it wasn't abrogated.
So, Mr, Justice Stevens, I can say that I agree with
El Paso.

I think El Paso is right.

But I agree with our

23

position in 'this esse, and I think we’re right.

1 -chink you

have two completely differant contracts * and two completely
different situations.
Now —~ excuse me, is that light going to go on again
in five minutes, or -—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

If you want to save ~

how much do you want to save for rebuttal?
MR. MILBURN:

Wei 1 e I’d like to save what I have

lefty will b© about seven minutes , I guess.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That's about right.

You may reserve that for rebuttal.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Severn.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL I. SOVERN, ESQ.t
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SOVERN:

Mr. Chief Justice.

If the Court

please:
Of all the

hundreds of cases alleging contract

impairment that have coma before this Court in two centuries,
none has involved public ends as vital as those sought to be
served by the State here, and few have involved contract
infringements so inconsequential.
In the second slaughterhouse case, the Court found
offensive smells sufficiently serious to bring butchering
squarely within the State's police power, and the justification

24

for the State’s repealing the statute# granting an exclusive
franchise to a company that had invested large sums of money
in reliance on the promise that the excluisve franchise would
be good for 25 years.
Ho one suggested that butchering threatened anybody's
life or health,
QUESTION: Did you have any express — were there
any express assurances -there about the malodorous factors?
MR, SOVERN:
QUESTION:

As to whether —
Or was it just that it was an incident

of running a slaughterhouse in those days?
MR. SOVERN:

That was the basis on which the police

power was assarted,
QUESTION:

Yesr I

know, but was there an express

grant — was it articulated there that they could go on without
any restraint of that kind?
MR, SOVERN:

In that case, Your Honor, the repeal

did not involve their losing the right to continue; all they
lost was the right to do it exclusively.

So the existence

of the police power justified a destruction of a very valuable
portion of their investment, even though there had been an
explicit promise that it was to he good for 25 years.
And the justification was that when one is dealing
with stench, the State has the power to act as it will.
Her®, the Federal Environmental Protection Administra-

25

tor has found automobile emissions so threatening to the
physical well-being of the citizens of Hew Jersey that he has
ordered them to drive less.

He’s insisted that, parking

facilities be limited, that trucks not pick up or deliver
on weekday mornings from six to eleven, with all the economic
dislocation that entails, and has said that if these and other
measures don’t work, he will reduce the amount of gasoline
that may be sold in the State.
In Blaisda11, as this Court knows well, the Court
upheld Minnesota’s Mortgage Moratorium Act because of the
economic distress —
QUESTION:

Mr. Severn, how does the repeal of the

1962 covenant*, change the air quality in Haw Jersey?
MR. SOVERT?; The covenant does two things, Your Honor,
that it is critical to correct.

One is it effectively

prevents the imposition of higher tolls on the users of the
Port Authority’s bridges and tunnels between New York and New
Jersey.
That is to say, because the Port Authority’s revenues
and reserves are so large, a toll rise on the bridges would be
disapproved as not just and reasonable within the meaning of
the Bridge Act of 1906, which means that the disincentive

to automobiles crossing from New Jersey to New York — the
Port Authority owns all of the crossings between those two
*

States, in the Port District —

26

QUESTION;

is the only method of limiting the number

of vehicles that cross the bridge to increase the fare?
MR. SOVERM:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honorf there
That would b© the only consequence in

terms of air quality, wouldn’t it?
MR, SOVERN:

Well,, there are many other methods, at

.least some of which would be far more destructive of the bond
holders5 interest, without —
QUESTION: Well, are there any methods of, just if
you concentrate on that one feature, limiting the amount of
traffic coming across the bridge ~~ are there any ways that
that could be done without tampering at all with the New York
Port Authority?

With the bond holder structure.

Couldn’t you close the bridge for a couple of hours
a day?
MR. SOVERN;

You could, Your Honor.

I do believe

Mr. Milburn would be here maintaining that that was a violation
of covenants with bond holders.

I do believe that the police

power does entitle the State to do that.
This is far less intrusive on bond holder rights.
The bridges ares among the Port Authority's biggest money
makers.

I believe the States could close them.

I believe the

States could close them during the summer, during commuter
hours, for as many hours as they wished, that bore the
relationship that was necessary to reduce carbon monoxide and

27
hydrocarbon poisoning.
The bond holders would be seriously hurt by that.
They have not been hurt at all in this case.

That point is

important to focus on,, so that the States here have sought, to
achieve their goals in the ways that are least destructive of
the interests that are being claimed to have bean violated.
To complete ray answer to your question, Mr. Justice
Stevens, not only does -the covenant prevent that particular
mode of responding to the pollution problem, it also prevents
what all students of this subject regard as the most rational
c

approach? and that is to say, to use charges imposed upon
auto drivers to support mass transit.
QUESTIONs

Is there any evidence of an attempt to

get a more limited change in the terms of th© bonding venture,
to just permit that change without repealing the entire
covenant?
MR. SOVERM;

The difficulty, Your Honor, is that the

covenant is absolutely categorical, and •—
QUESTION?

33 tr does. have a procedure for getting

consent to change, isn't there?
MR. SOVERN:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

And this -—

You don’t think the bond holders would

have consented to a permission to increase the tells, -then?
MR. SOVERN;

Unquestionably not, Mr. Justice Stevens.

Mr. Milburn says the only person from whom he heard how

difficult it. would be was we.

The chief witness for the

plaintiff in the trial court was Mr. John Thompsons at page
192 of the Appendix, Mr. Thompson wrote as followss
!,In my opinion an approach to the bondholders for a
modification of th® 1962 restrictions accompanied by a moderate
increase in interest rate on their bonds would fail, partly
because it would b® unacceptable and partly because of th®
procedural difficulties."
QUESTION:

Would that change ~

QUESTION:

All right, who is Mr. Thompson?

MR. SOVERN:

Mr. Thompson was plaintiff’s witness,

called to discuss 'this question among —
QUESTION:

What is his expertise?

I mean- why

should his testimony —
MR. SOVERN:

Oh, he was presented as an expert on

the bond market, the rights of bond holders and the behavior
of th© investment community.
QUESTION;

But was the change he was discussing on©

that would permit investment into mass transit, or merely a
change in th© tolls?

I mean, is that testimony really

responsive to the kind of question I was asking?
MR. SOVERN:

Well. I’m not clear, Your Honor.

His basic position was that any moderate rise in th© interest
rate for bond holders would not indue® them to come out and
go through the procedures required to consent to any change.

29

Thai is to say, there is a vary elaborate procedure
for bond holder change —
QUESTION;

Well, the reason — let me just — I don't

went to be obtuse, and I

may not be following you, but, as I

understand their argument, they say the objection to the
repealer is that it will permit the Port Authority to make
investments in mass transits, which are deficit operations,
where you lose lots of money.
And you say well, we "want to do that because we went
to raise the tolls on the bridges.
And I’m asking you, couldn’t you have made an
amendment which permitted you to raise the tolls on the
bridges without also permitting you to go into mass transit
facilities operations?
MR. SOVERNs

I think —* I think not, Your Honor.

There would have been several problems.
One is that fee legislation governing tolls on
bridges is federal.

I would say the Bridge Act cf 1906

entrusts now to the Federal Highway Administrator the
discretion, judgment really, to determine whether bridge tolls
are just and reasonable.
In his proceeding, and it’s been confirmed in the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals, he has taken into account the
us® to which tolls area put and has declared that the use of
tolls for fee purpose of mass transit, justifies a higher toll

30

than would otherwise be permissible.

Therefore, the. simple

modification of the Hew Jersey legislation to raise tolls would
not pass federal muster»
QUESTION:

Moreover.

In other words., toll raising cannot be a

device for cutting down on air pollution, then?

Which I

thought you were saying was the reason for this whole thing.
MR, SG'/ERN:

It can as part of a package. Your Honor.

That’s the point. The covenant blocks a cfcordinated addressing
of these problems.
Mi at it does —- when it's gone, you can then take a
package that says you charge higher tolls, creating dis­
incentive to those polluting automobiles.
increased tolls, you support mass transit.

You take those
With that mass

transit, you then provide th© alternative to those auto
drivers, so that you’re not just simply preventing ’them from
traveling.

And it is that, coordinated attack on the problems

of th© State that the covenant precludes.
Mow, there’s not just pollution.

As this Court knows

very well, the energy problems of -the region were critical.
Indeed, the gun battles that attended the fuel oil allocations
in parts of this country bore a very strong resemblance to the
way in which Minnesota farmers greeted foreclosing sheriffs
and judges.
And th® economic dislocation that the Federal
Environmental Protection Administrator has told rh -this State

31
must bear if it. is to come into compliance with-, federal law
is very much like the kind, of destruction of economic
affairs that afflicted Minnesota»
QUESTION:

Is it possible, Mr» Savam, that, closing

the bridges down and doing some of these other things that were
suggested by Justice Stevens were politically unpalatable?
MR. SOVERNs Well, there’s no question about that.
Your Honor» that neither Legislature
QUESTION:

The voices of those people would be

heard more widely than the voices of 'the bond holders in the
public arena, wouldn't they?
MR» SOVERM:

Wall, tlie re's no question about it.

But the difficulties are not simply those of political choice.
The Stats has only the most limited kinds of controls left to
it.

It really is tinder the gun of those environmental orders,

and when 'the Environmental Protection Administrator tells the
State of New Jersey that it roust sell no more gasoline, than
it did in 1973, I don’t know where the politics would be*
I would guess there are a lot more New Jersey
voters who never cross -the Hudson, and that, closing down the
bridges and tunnels may begin to look like an attractive
alternative.
As this Court said in El Paso, when you get to the
subject of means, that’s exactly the kind of question as to
which the Legislature has to have the widest possible

32
discretion..

For this Court to put the State of New Jersey

in condition where it has to choose whether to close, those
bridges and tunnels,- we’ll let the local business close up
for certain of the days,, is,- I respectfully submit, —
QUESTION:

Mr. Severn, couldn’t the States have

provided that if the

Authority was to go into mass transit,

it could go into it as a separate operation in the sense that
its

other revenues and its other assets would not be subject

to a lien of any losses in mass transit, and couldn’t the
State have otherwise underwritten those losses, rather than
expose the bond holders who have the right to the revenues in
other operations?
MR. SOVERN:
Mr. Justice White.

Well, let me say two things about that,

First, I think it is not

QUESTION;

Isn’t it historically — didn't it, in

the beginning, didn’t they used to, in the Port Authority early
days, specialise in bonds — I mean the bonds would just reach
certain projects?
MR. SOVERN;

In the vary earliest days the bonds were

single projects to the bonds.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

MR. SOVERN; But they failed.
QUESTION;
MR. SOVERN;
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand, —
And that’s why --

But, nevertheless, if

the State had wanted -to — if tho States had wanted to commit
their own credit rather than the Port Authority5 s# they could
have had the Port Authority go into mass transit as a separate
single venture»
MR. SOVERN: There is no project of -the Port Authority
for which it would have bean possible to sell bonds# if it were
not supported by the others.
QUESTION;

So -**

MR. SOVERN;

Unless the States guaranteed.

important —
QUESTION;
Wasn’t this some

Yes, Nell# teat's what I’m asking you.
this certainly was a feasible and less

intrusive way of going about it,
MR. SOVERN;

I’m afraid it wasn't feasible.

And

it —
QUESTION; Well# it wasn’t feasible# but it was less
intrusive* as far as the bond holders go.
MR. SOVERN;

No question the bond holders would have

been happier had the States done it that way.
QUESTION;

la tee States# isn’t there a constitu­

tional barrier to a State doing anything like that?
MR. SOVERN:

Well# in both States it would require

public referenda# and you ’would have problems with debt limita­
tion clauses

34
Moreover, it's important to remember that the Port
District is not a State,, so that in each referendum the citizens
voting from outside the Port District would be being asked to
increase their taxes in order to pay for mass transit in the
Port District while it is running annual revenues that grow
every year, and reservas; that grow every year.
It’s just —
QUESTION: That's what I'd like to know.

How much

mass transit do you get if you win?.
MR. SOVERI?: Well, the leverage is extraordinary,
by the commitment of $12 million in increased tolls, the
State of New Jersey has so far been promised $IE>7 million by
the Department of Transportation for the PATH Plainfield
extension, and has received permission to use another $70
million from Federal Highway funds.
Nov?, that $12 million is already in the till.
not coming from bond holders, it is coming from driver’s.

It is
The

returns on those tolls, as Mr. Mi lb urn indicated, as an increase
of $40 million a year. So that by being able to apply those
tolls, it will now be possible, the DDT has signed off on that
grant, provided the local share is committed. And the local
share has, by agreement between New Jersey and the Port
Authority, been divided between them.
If the Port Authority cannot put up its share, which
is debt service of $12 million a year.

The project will fail.

35

The irony is that that project is intended to serve Newark
Airport*
QUESTION!

I'm asking, what is this project?

That's

MR. SOVERN:

stuck with a great big deficit bill* year after year, for the
four or five years»
MR, SOVERK;
QUESTION:

But it's —
And in the future.

Because mass transit

will never pay for itself,
MR, SOVERN:

That is correctf Your Honor,

It will

not pay for itself, but the Port Authority is not being stuck
with a deficit, they are in this to the tune of 12 million a
year., and they have already received far more than that from
the toll rise. And they will continue to receive far more than
that from the toll rise,
Mr, Mi lb urn talked about the rising deficits of the
PATH railroad.

In every year in which those deficits went up,

so did the revenues and reserves of the Port Authority,

It

has absorbed every nickel of those reserves — of those
deficits.

It has absorbed every nickel of 'She cost overruns

on the World Trade Center,

It lived with the fuel crisis,

hurting its airport, bridge and tunnel business, and ©very
year its revenues and reservas rose, and it passed the
quarter of a billion dollar mark last year in reserves that;
have not been called upon.
That is to say, there is approximately $260 million
in reserves belonging to the. Port Authority that ar© not going
to have to be looked to for support of anything, because the
annual revenues of the Port Authority also continue to grow, and

QUESTION:

When you’re dealing with $100 million or

$100 billion, there’s always going to b® real consequence,
isn’t there?
MR® SOVERN:

Well, not like this.

I began by saying,

and it was not a rhetorical flourish, that you haven’t had a
case with ends as important as these.

I mean, -this is the

living and breathing of fee citizens of two States, fee
economic survival of their institutions in the face of an
energy crisis.

These are consequences that are greater than

any of those, any previous contract cases put before this
Court.
QUESTION:

This might have something to do with the

capacity of governments at all levels to borrow money, doesn’t
it also?
MR. SOVERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the evidence in this

cas© indicates feat it does not.

Just last month the Port

Authority sold $50 million worth of bonds at a seven percent
coupon, with this case pending before this Court, the State
having repealed the covenant.

That is three-eighths of a point:

39

higher than the 35th series of Port Authority bonds sold for,
with the covenant in effect» And it sold at a time when every
bond dealer that tries to sell a security with the name New
York on it finds hiras®If with a drug»
So that trie notion that this record supports the
proposition that the municipal bond market will be destroyed
or even seriously impaired by permitting States to take
measures that meet two conditions;

one? the pursuit of an

important public purpose? and, two, no damageOne of the witnesses for the plaintiff below was a
fellow by the narae of Murphy, and he’s an officer of Barr
Brothers»

And Barr Brothers is

us about the bond market, too.

and he was offered to tell
And Barr Brothers has

announced as follows — this appears at pages 422 and 423 of
the -Appendix;
"Whether or not the Port Authority ever gets involved
in mass transit, w@ feel it continues to be one of the finest
revenue credits in the country, amply protected by the basic
bond resolution, excellent management and some highly profitable
and monopolistic facilities that can more -than carry a
reasonable amount of mass transit, particularly with the recent
•toll increases.55
That was issued after the trial court’s decision.
There is no risk of default, nobody’s claimed any risk of
default. The revenues are safe.

The reserves are safe.

There

40
are bond holder protections here that the General Solicitor of
the Port Authority described as precluding any assumption of
mass transit responsibilities that would threaten the bond
holders.
Our friends profess puzzlement as to how w@ can say
that the covenant is an impediment to rational planning and
at the same time that it*s repealed will not hurt bond holders
by freeing up resources ,
The answer is that the other bond holder protections
save -the bond holders from any project that could really
\

threaten their security.
All feha covenant does is prevent projects that are
not threatening.

It bans categorical and therefore it prevents

even a project it wouldn't hurt.
There's no way that the Port Authority can pick up a
mass transit project that would threaten the security of bond
holders.

And that was ‘the opinion of Mr, Goldberg in 1961 #

before the adoption of the covenant and not made in tine context;
in which he 'was peddling bonds.

That was a talk he gave to

Port Authority insiders, and that was later published three
years later, because it was regarded as such a fine statement
of the financial status of the Port Author!ty.
And Mr, ”*~
QUESTION:

Mr, Severn, supposing that immediately

after the repeal of the covenant the value of these, the market

41

value of these bonds had dropped to fifty percent of what they
had been immediately before, you would obviously have a much
worse case than you do now®
Do you think you would lose it, or do you think you
might still be able to win it?
MR® SOVERN:

On this record, if that were the only

change, I would 'think we should still win it.
The reason being that on the day of the repeal, the
day Governor Byrne signed -the repeal, the plaintiff held a
press conference and savaged these bonds, said they have been
gravely impaired — the story was reported in the Wall Street
Journal, the New York Times, and every Jersey newspaper coming
out weekly or daily®
Now, if any tiling is calculated to obscure the
probativa effect of a market reaction, that surely is®

The

plaintiff is the largest holder of these bonds, and to say
■that they had been severely damaged would clearly cause some
drop in the market, and it did®

The bonds did go down,

Mr® Mi lb urn has suggested to you that something has happened
to the Mass Porte, bonds of the Massachusetts Port Authority,
to make them no longer comparable.
Nothing has happened to those bonds, except that that,
original shakeout, attributable, we think, to the United States
Trust Company’s damaging these bonds, improved with the
passage of time, statements like Barr Brothers, the renewal of

42

feh@ same A rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's* that they
had always given it.
After that initial savaging, people had a chance to
taka a look and do an ©valuation.

And what they found out

was that these bonds are terrific,
\

Moreover, the briefs tall you ihera's a short-term
effect of that recovery — that recovery has now been in effect,
for two years. The Mass Ports and New York Ports last week
were selling within a half a point of each other.
So that there's no damage in the market, -there's no
damage in th© light of Moody's and Standard & Poor's,

The

company that employs one of the plaintiff's witnesses says
this is terrific, there's nothing to fear, go out and buy it.
There's no damage.

And all those opinions — and

those are opinions that count, that people are acting on, not
testimony in litigation — all those opinions are supportive
by the documents themselves.

there be an emergency.

their promises in the absence of an emergency.

keep them, it has an obligation -that has been quite •— taken
quite seriously by the courts in both New York and New Jersey*
QUESTION: Well, what — if it's such a little risk,
why doesn't the

State — the States just guarantee the out­

standing bonds?
MR. SOVERN:
QUESTION:

They can't do that, Your Honor,
You mean — well, they can't do it without,

having a referendum, I guess.
MR, SOVERN:

That’s right.

And both States must

have it, since it's a bi-Sfcate agency,
QUESTION: Well, you can't say it's impossible,
MR. SOVERN:

No, but we can say that, -the chances of

success are very dim, indeed.
QUESTION: Well, it’s a vary -tiny risk, if you say,
so I don’t know why the States vJbuldn*t shoulder that risk.
MR. SOVERN:

Well, they haven't, Your Honor,

And

it is the voters that will have to choose, to vote to support
projects that ara already •—
QUESTION:

Well, you can’t say it’s much of an

emergency until you try, can you?
MR. SOVERN:

Well, New York has had a transportation,

bond issue defeated, and so has New Jersey.

The difficulty

in trying it now is, of course, that the pending projects will

48
be scrapped^ and further delay, further cost escalation, and
the — again 1 corae back to the statement in El Paso that
states that where you have legitimate public ends, the choica
of means is on© as 'to which this Court will give wide
latitude to the Legislatures.
The judgment whether to hold referenda on support
for the addition to Port Authority facilities, it seems to me,
is on® that — the outcome of which is almost nullible, it’s
highly likely that the people of the two Statas will defeat
those referenda, knowing, as cannot be denied mid hasn't been
denied, that ‘the Port Authority's .resources are ample to
undertake that, without a ripple.

I mean, the Port Authority

has the continuing revenue from its other facilities that can
support that without the least bit of difficulty.
And, as this Court knows, that is not true of the
ability to borrow of New York City or New York State at this
timee
QUESTION: What do you suppose a referendum among the
bond holders, on whether the covenant should be repealed, would
bring?
MR., SOVEKN: Well, I have no doubt, Your Honor, that
they don't like it®
QUESTION: Well, they don't like it. they

but you

couldn't convince them that it's just a tiny risk?
MR* SOVEHN:

I'll tell you, the fact is that when the

49

covenant hasn't been there, they have bought the bonds0
That is to say, the last series to be sold before the covenant
was sold in January 1962»

The previous year the New York State

Legislature had directed the Port Authority to take over the
Hudson & Manhattan»

That was tea fearful takeover»

Those bonds want off without a hitch, and at then
prevailing interest rates» When th© covenant was repealed,
prospectively, the Port Authority
QUESTTON:

But you* re just saying that they can

still sell som© bonds, but tee people buying bonds now are
talcing their risk.
MR. SOVERN:
QUESTION:

What 1:m suggesting to Your Honor ■—
The old bond holders didn’t think they

war® taking any risk.
MR. SOVERNi

What I'm suggesting to Your Honor is

that the perception of purchasers before and after the —
before adoption of tee covenant and after repeal, was that
they needed no protection from such a risk.

That the Port

Authority's other bond holder protections would take care of
teem.

I am inviting you to draw the inference that teat

kind of perception of th© risks is an accurate on©, in which
they are betting

we have no way of knowing whether tee bond

holders who bought, during the period of the covenant would
have bought without the covenant.
What wo do know is those .who bought before bought

50

without, and that -those who bought after bought without.
QUESTION:

But you’re saying -that you wouldn't

expect the old bond holders aver to agree to fch@ repeal of the
covenant.
MR.

SOVERN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I really

am relying vary heavily on the plaintiff's own witnesses,
and on plaintiff’s counsel, who swore that 95 percent of the
bond holders' identities were unknown to the Port Authority.
So that the burden there, really, was assumed to be
that — one that could not be met.
The Court reaches the question of the impairment of
contracts, of course, only if it first finds that there was a
contract.

And we have urged two grounds for maintaining that

there was no contract:

one, the avoidability of an amendment

©f an Interstate Compact, without congressional consent? and
the other, the preemption of the covenant by federal enactments,
whose full effectuation it impeded.
Naturally, if th® Court is moved by either of those
arguments, it could quite logically take them instead of the
impairment question.

The courts below chose to address the

impairment question and not the compact question.
To come back for just a moment to the question of the:
effect of the covenant, we find it at a time when it’s desired
to discourage auto traffic, and increase mass transit.

tliat the public agency responsible for coordinating the

We fine!

51
region's transportation entrusted by the States with a highly
profitable monopoly of bridges of tunnels could contribute to
the area’s transportation needs only because of the covenant?
by further support of the internal combustion engine.
The repeal of the covenant makes it possible to take
& more balanced approach to those needs„

And we have talked

about the PATH-Plainfield project.
To sum up? plaintiff admits? at page 66 of its
brief? that:

53X£ it can foe said in th© case at bar that the

ends to be accomplished are improvement in mass transit? d@cree.se
in air pollution and conservation of energy? it must b@ granted,
that they are legitimate.a
The end is legitimate.
has baen proved.

Repeal serves them.

No damage

This is a classic case of the proper use of

th® State’s police power.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Milbum, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEVSREUX MILBURN? ESQ.?
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, MILBURN;
^

Yes? sir.

I was wrong? and I apologize.

I had forgotten Mr.

Thompson’s statement about the obtaining of bond holders5
consent.

I don't know who in the Stata was in touch with Mr,

Thompson, so they didn’t try it.

But it seems to me they should

52
have tried it.

It's built right into the statuter that fchat’s

the way to change it, and that’s the way to modify it.

And

I don’t -think there’s any excuse for not trying it, because

&

you think it isn't going to work, particularly when it did work
not too long before that with the Triborough Bridge Authority»
Now, increasing tolls — I thought 1 had covered this
in my opening statement -- $40 million, $12 million, it doesn’t:
go to mass transit, it goes to the bond holders, it goes into
the pot»

And if it doesn’t go into the pot, there’s a breach

of the covenant with bond holders, and there’s another loss
of

and Dean Severn is quite right, 1 would he back if that

happens»
Now, actually, there is $296,000 increase between
1974 and 1975. Now, you're not talking about $40 million, you’re
not talking about $12 million, you're not talking about the
$12 million you need for PATH Plainfield,
impossible?

Is a State guarantee

New York did it with the commuter cars»

didn’t, but Hew York did*

New Jersey

And they are still there, some of

them.
Now, also, I xsiight point out that the two governments
have prevented, between them, first one mid then the other,
a fare rise.
35 cents.

They don’t even do that. They don’t even pass

The Amtrak is running at a dollar, right next to

it, right -»*■ two parallel tracks»
But will the Governors give them a fare rise?

No,

53

they won® t,
Why can't the States do something, except abrogate
our contract?

That's what I would like to know,

I don’t knoi*T

the answer to that kind ©f question*
New, Mr» Justice Marshall, you mentioned a new
deficit going into PATH,
fchato

We’ve got a beauty,

wcj'XX

We’ve got one running about $28 million*

all admit

It was supposed

to run six, it's running 28,
Let’s put another one in there, and let’s say that the
Commissioners ar© wrong again, are wrong by a factor of five
©gala, and let's say we’ve got another $30 million deficit in
there, and, in the meantime, PATH has gone up.
about a $70 million deficit.

We’re talking

Let’s have a little depression,

let’s have our airports slack off a little bit, and they are
going to default on the bonds.
That’s why we don't want a tremendous new deficit
into the Port Authority, and you can't stop it because it comes
in as a baby and it grows into a giant,
Now, the plaintiff’s press conference, we savaged
the bonds.

In my humble opinion, on© of ‘the major reasons

that those bonds haven’t gone down further is because we're
)

standing here,

I don't know a bond man in Wall Street -that

doesn't think that this is an outrage and that we’re going to
win.
Now, if we don’t, let’s see what happens to the bonds.

54
Now, I just have a minuta or -too, if I could consides'
Mr. Murphy for a moment.

Mr. Murphy mad© a statement which is

quoted in our foz'ief, ‘Siat if you bought a car and you had a
12-month warranty and all of a sudden it became a six-month
warranty, you wouldn’t buy a car from that fellow again.
He said that’s what has happened to the bond market.
Now, Barr Brothers puts out their ads, but what is
their business?
bonds?

They do»

Pushing bonds. Who owns the Port Authority
They’ve got to sell them. They can’t just

leave them on the shelf.
I put no credence in that — and that’s an ad,that’s
puffing.
But Mr. Murphy was testifying under oath, and I do
put some credence in th§t»
Now, to sum up, let vm say -this:

I don’t think this

is — -this css© is a case that can b© — it could be decided
either way.

It has bean decided the way that I thought was

impossible, but it has been decided that-way, it would be
possible to decide it the other way.
a fact case»

I don’t think this is

I don’t think this is a lav? case»

I think that

this is a moral case.
I think the Statas have repudiated their words.
I think this case, in its present posture, represents

© leak in th® dike of State integrity» And I think that this
Court can stop that leak before it becomes an avalanche.

55
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
