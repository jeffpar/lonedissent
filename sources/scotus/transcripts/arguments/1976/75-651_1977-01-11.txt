Mrs,

Martinez, you have about seven minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. VILMA 8. MARTINEZ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. - Resumed
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Thank you very much, Yotir Honor.

Regarding our named plaintiffs, it’s clear that our
plaintiffs wanted to go on the road, and since the mid-1960"s
had made this known to the company and to the unior, officials.
One day after the EEOC charges were filed in 1970,
plaintiffs were offered a letter of application on a fcake-itor-leave-it basis. They -took it, though they said they under­
stood it entailed a loss of seniority.
In December of 1970, not knowing, as Mr. Perez
pointed out, Vwhich way to go, h© wrote a letter to Frank
Fitzsimmons, acting president of the Teamsters, complaining
about the continuing inability to get road positions, and
again requesting his assistance and guidance,
Mt0 Fitzsimmons’ response was to refer the letter to
the vice president and Area Director of the Southern Conference
in Dallas,

That was the sum total of the protection afforded

by the Teamsters to their members, either under Article 38
or otherwise.
In their complaint and in their depositions, all

59

felire® named plaintiffs seek relief from the discriminatory
impact of fch© no transfer and th® contract seniority rules»
Further, regarding th© class, the class properly
consists of all black and Maxican-Am©rican city drivers, and
'this is proper because all of them, by virtu© of being a
member of a particular race or ethnic origin, were denied th©
opportunity to b© considered for a road position tSirough the
operation of the no transfer and contract seniority rules, on
the employer’s racially based assignments, as we have in th©
record, all 180 road drivers were Anglo.
Anglos had a choice of whether they would be road
or city drivers ? blade and Mexican-Americans did not.
A class finding is proper because w© had a class of
people subjected, as a class, to discriminatory policies.
For purposes of class certification, all we need dc is to
identify those subjected to discriminatory policies , in tills
instance the black and M©xican~American city drivers.
Of course, for purposes of relief, the class will be
narrowed to exclude, for example, those who cannot drive and
those who are not interested in these positions.
That fell© district court erred in dismissing outright
th© class action is clear, and the Fifth Circuit so held.
Even if remand is thought necessary, to look at the
scope of the class, the decision of the Fifth Circuit reversing
the outright dismissal of th© class was correct, and should be

60

upheld»
All we are seeking her© is an opportunity for class
members to coma to the court and prove themselves an their
individual merits, just like H. L. Johnson, the 'president of
Ea3t Texas Motor Freight, who want from dock worker to city
driver to road driver to supervisor and eventually company
president.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well, Mrs. Martinez.

Mr. Mon tentay or.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUBEN MONTEMAYOR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS HERRERA, ET AL.
MR. MONTEMAYORs

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of

toe Court:
Min© is not a class action.
with East Texas.

I would like to

I have nothing to do

explain to Your Honors my

presence in this case.
I represent six respondents who were city drivers
for Lee Way and Yellow Freight System.

These respendents

filed lawsuits against Lea Way, Yellow Freight, Local 657, the
Southern Conference, and the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
The district court, in toe Western District of Texas,
San Antonio, Texas, found no discrimination against all of the
respondents at toat time.

61

Th© truck drivers appealed the case to tie Fifth
Circuit# and the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision of the
district court and found that Le© Way * Yellow Freight/ Local
65? and the Southern Conference had discriminated against the
truck drivers, in violation of th® Civil Rights Act of 1964,
QUESTIONS

Your clients were all employees of either

one or both, of those corporations, and they were city truck
drivers, were they?
MR, MONTEMAYOR:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

In San Antonio?

MR, MONTEMAYOR;

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

The 'three —

five truck drivers were employees of Le© Way, and three were
city truck drivers of Yellow Freight.
QUESTION; Did either on® of those companies have
over*»the-road drivers domiciled in San Antonio?
MR. MONTEMAYOR; At th® time Le® Way Motor Freight had
line drivers in San Antonio, and members — and about twenty of
them were members of Local 657.
Th® record in th© Fifth Circuit reflects the
testimony of th© president of Local 657.
before Your Honors.

That raccrd is not

However, I personally questioned the

president of Local 657, and it was his testimony that there
were 20 line drivers from Lea Way, and about eight from Brown
Express, which was not part of this.
Le© Way petitioned for writ of certiorari.

Yellow

62

Freight petitioned for writ of certiorari „ And both writs of
certiorari were denied by -this Court»
However# motion for rehearing is pending in those
cases o
Local 657 and th© Southern Conference mad© our
clients, ©ur truck driver respondents# parties to cheir
petition for writ of certiorari# and this is th© mason that
we are h@r©0
I wish to respectfully ask this Court to affirm th©
decision of th© Fifth Circuit as to the Local 657 .and
Southern Conference»
Th® reason that -fell© respondents in this case# six
truck drivers# who are Ernest Herrera# Trini Uribi, Marie
MeIchor from Yellow Freight# Patrick Resendis# Tony Escobedo
and Elias Gonzales from Lee Way, respectfully presents to this
honorable Court that they war© discriminated against because
of the no transfer .policy of Lee Way and Yellow Freight#
together with the seniority rosters that served to lock in
th© Mexican-Amarican driver from bettering himself in life.
My clients claim that the fact that th© •»*• that
management# not allowing them to transfer to over-the-road
because they would lose their job# not knowing whether they
were going to he accepted ov@r-fch®-road# would find, themselves
%

lost if they war© to com© back to try and reapply with the same
company»

63

So they would go fco the union for help,, and the
union would tall them that if they war© to transfer over-theroad,» that they would hav© to give up their seniority, go
over™the*”road, and start at the bottom of the list,
Now, if this — and they felt 'that in sane instances
they were even discouraged from seeking employment over-the=*
road, for the reason that it would not do them any good.
In the first place, -they would lose their job? in die second
place, they would lose their seniority»

Some of these truck

drivers had been driving for the city for 15 or 20 years.
So the truck drivers were in a dilemma.
Now, the union, if they were to remove the no
transfer policy and allow -the truck driver to pro coed without
quitting, and try to get an over-the-road driver's job, would
go to the union and still lose his seniority.
So, working together, and I don’t know if management
and toe union were holding hands in this particular instance,
by locking the cdfcy truck drivers and discouraging 'them from
going over**toe-road? but it seems funny to me that — and
unusual — that most of the city drivers were Msaxic anAmericans and most of fch*a over-fche-road drivers war® whit®.
Now, Lee Way domiciled line driver terminal, at to©
time we filed the lawsuit, in San Antonio,

The statistics

showed — which were presented fco to® Fifth. Circuit — that
25 fco 30 Anglo line drivers were employed at to© Sea Antonio

64

terminal.
Subsequently, Lee Way hired sis Anglo drivers and
one Mexican-American, who was subsequently discharged.

Nov?,

this Mexican-American was a member of Local 657.
Lee Way never hired a Negro line driver in San
Antonio.

Of 44 city drivers at Lea Way, 26 or 28 ar©

Mexican-Americans, four are black, and the remainder ar© white
or Anglo.
Now, in Yellow Freight, who did not domicile line
drivers in San Antonio, —
QUESTION:

Lee Way did domicile line drivers in San

Antonio?
MR. MONTEMAYOR:

Yes, sir, Your Honor,

I understand. Justice Rehnquist, that they do not
domicil© line drivers at the present time.

They transferred

the line drivers after we filed the lawsuit.
In the Yellow Freight case, some 50 line® drivers war®
employed at the Dallas terminal, and 46 line drivers ware
employed at the Amarillo terminal.

This was 96 line drivers,

no Mexican-American line drivers until after -the filing of
th© complaint in this case.
QUESTION;

Yon filed th© complaint in 19'?Q, did you

say?
MR. MONTEMAYQR:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Was there any showing as to how much hiring

65

there had been between the effective date of the f2derail law
and the filing'of your lawsuit in 19 70?

In other -words, if

there had been no hiring whatsoever? the statistics you are
mentioning wouldn’t have any relevance so far as violation of
federal law goes.
MR. MONTEMAYORS
QUESTIONS

This is true? Your Honor.

Becaus® prior to 1965 there would have

been nothing whatsoever illegal about that, under this?
because the law wasn’t enacted.
MR. MONTE MAYOR i

This is true? Your Honor.

QUESTIONS So was there any evidence as to what hiring?
if any? there had been between 1965 and 1970?
MR. MONTEMAYOR:

I believ® that the statistics shows
*

what the — what management had don® after w© filed the lawsuit?
Your Honor.

X don’t believe w© went back -- w© want back to

the time of their original employment? and the facis remained
the same? that there were just no Mexican-American line
drivers ? and there war© no Mexican-Am®rican line drivers
hired prior to the time that we —
QUESTION: Well? were other drivers hired?
Over-the-road drivers.

That’s feh© question.

MR. MONTEMAYOR:

You mean Anglo drivers?

QUESTION;

Between — after 1965.

Yes.

MR. MONTEMAYOR:
QUESTION;

Yas ? sir? there were.

The record shows that?

66

MR, MONTEMAYOR;

Y©s , sir,

Th@r© was a Maxic&n-American hired after 1965, by
the name of Art Rodrigues, and he was dismissed because of his
driving record.
QUESTION:

I 3@@.

MR, MONTEMAYOR;

And, in fact, this was the —■

in fact, he went, through a grievance through Local 65? as a
line driver, and won the first grievance and lost the second
grievance.

Tha president of Local 657 represented him in that

case.
What I am trying to put across, Your Honcr, is that
Local 657 did have line drivers within their jurisdiction.
As far as remedy is concerned, the Fifth Circuit
remanded the case to th© district court for proper remedy.
And, if I may, Your Honor, as far as the loss of seniority,
if a city driver who wants to better himself seeks a promotion
by going over-the-road, and at the same time that he seeks that
promotion he has to give something or lose something, and not
b® equal to the line driver who has been there about the. same
time, then I fa©l that the two seniority systems da finitely
discourage and partly locks in the minority group.
How, the no transfer policy of management —•
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR, MONTEMAYOR;

You may finish your thought,

Thank you, sir,

Tha no transfer policy of management, together with

67

the two separate seniority systems, definitely discriminate,
because it definitely locks in»
Now, the seniority system, by itself, definitely
' discourages»
Thank you very much»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well.

Mr» Kotvedt, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. HOTVEDT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 75-7.18
MR, HOTVEDT2

In rebuttal, w® would return to the

case of East Texas Motor Freight and its differences with
Mrs, Martin©z*s clients.
We think, the arguments have been clarify ing for the
Court in at least four respects.
First, v/e think that the statistical inferences that
plaintiffs would -us© to let minority plaintiffs or classes
fulfill the prima facie case is precisely the most extreme and
indefensible standard that we fear»

We have briefed that.

We briefed hew the Court should refrain from endorsing this
extreme standard, that if an employer has a statis ideal
imbalance as to a racial, type some place, that it is pre­
sumptively liable to anybody of that same racial type any
place, despite different- industrial relations facts.
We hops that than© is no endorsement in this case ©£
so loos© a standard on th® prima facie test.

68

Second, what should b© don© if remand occurs?
Surely, if a remand occurs, it should be on all th« class
questions, arid not limited to the question of liability, to
the arbitrary class set by the Court of Appeals»
If a class is thereafter certified, the Court will
hear evidence on the question of whether the class,, or a
component of it, were realistically within the labor market,
where road driver opportunities occurred»

Careful attention

in evidence could be paid to the boundaries of relevant labor
markets and the difficult questions of labor mobility of the
p1aintiff class.
Third, the questions about the scop® of the class,
which were turned up in the colloquy between counsel ond the
Court, show the marshy ground that we are all on when we try
to define classes, or adjust them at the appellate level.
It all shows tli© need for the plaintiffs to take the
initiative before ferial to crystallize the class issue, and
obtain a resolution of it.
Yesterday we thought we heard an oral modification
of the class scope sought by respondents, but today, again, w©
hear it stated at on© of its broadest limits.
What is needed, if the class is heard on remand, is
fox- a district court to determine if, in the light cf feh©
consent decree’s remedies to minorities throughout Texas and
\

this company’s system, any class at all should b© certified; or,

69

if on© is certified, at what scop© that will not -p rovide some
collision or conflict with th® detailed remedies wrought in
the 707 decree under 'the Jus tic© Department's, the company's
and Judge Hughes' auspices.
And, finally, we stress that th© case her®, for
abandonment of fee class altogether by these plaintiffs, is
a rather strong ons.

Therefore, it would be possible to

restore Judge Wood's decision altogether and do no injustice
to punitive class members, for they would retain, with
appropriate jurisdictional requirements and their own standing,
the opportunity to assert their own claims, wall represented
by themselves or persons of their choosing»
QUESTION;

The statute of limitations might run,

might it not?
MR» HOTTEST;

I am not so sure — I couldn't respond

fee that correctly, Your Honor.

Because I don't knew toe

particular instances in the individual cases.
QUESTION;

You might have an impact ©f to at opinion

in Utah Pip® —*> well, that's —
MR. HOTTEST;

Okay.

I can't talk with you on that.

And, of course, they would remain free.

If they have

not already don® so, such as scores hav®, to assert their
claims under the consent decree.
Thank you.
QUESTION; Mas there any argument in the Court of

70

Appeals as to whether the statute of limitations had been
tolled or not?

By reason of a pendency of a class claim, or

at least arguably sc?
MR. HOTVEDT:

No, 1 don't believe thsre was.

No, Your Honor.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mrs. Martines

and gentlemen.
Th© c©ss is submitted.

above-entitled matters was submitted.]
