ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MIX, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CORVALLIS SAND AND GRAVEL CO.
MR. MIX;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, and gentlemens
I am Robert Mix, appearing her® on behalf of
Corvallis Sand and Gravel Company.
essentially the following;

The issues in the case are

Those made by the state are was

the change in channel of the Willamette River from a loop
approximately three miles in length to a basically straight
channel across the neck of th© loop avulsive.

In that con­

nection, it should b© pointed out that the land involved in
this case is not only the changed channel but a portion of th©
river as it had historically flowed in its natural bed.
The other issue mad© by the state is whether or not
th© change of channel transferred private dry land to the
state in fee simple by virtue of th® presence of the water
which had submerged private land.
The issues made by Corvallis Sand and Gravel are th®
following;

Does the state have sufficient title to maintain

ejectment to recover the bed of the river when its title is

5

based on sovereignty, arid when there is no issue in the case
as to interference with the public right of navigation and
fishery by Corvallis Sand.
In this connection, the sand and gravel materials
that were removed from th© river wire removed under permits
issued by the Corps of Engineers.
Th© second issue made by Corvallis Sand, does th©
state, by virtu© of its sovereignty have sufficient title to
recover money damages for removal by Corvallis Sand of sand
and gravel materials from th® bed of th© stream, again, there
being no issue as to interference with navigation or fishery
by Corv a 11 i s Sand.
In support of its position ™~
QUESTION?

Mr. Mix, isn't one of th© underlying

issues in the case, at least if you take some of the amicus
briefs, th® question of what law governs on this issue of
title, whether it is Oregon law or federal common law?
MR. MIX:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is my understanding

of the Bonelli decision that w® are now in an area to b©
controlled by federal common law, and that decision is at th®
core of th© Court's receiving this case, and the Court is to
spell out as a matter of common lav/ the extent of th© state’s
title.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, Bonelli is distinguishable

on its facts, isn’t it?

There you are dealing with what had

6
been an interstate boundary, and the Court, in its original
jurisdiction cases, it always treated that as a matter of
federal common law.

But the Willamette River at Corvallis

has never been an interstate boundary.
MR. MIX:

That is correct, Your Honor.

As to the

Willamette River, it is my understanding of Bonelli that the
Court said that first the state's title to the b®d is a
limited title, that the state's interest in the bed must bs
related to navigationj third, that that title is determinable
if the navigable aspect of the use of the bed ceasesj fourthly,
that the state's interest in the bed is 15as a bed" and in that
connection the Court cited the cas© of State v„ Gill, of
Alabama, in which the Alabama court held that the state holds
title to the bad as a bed and not to th® individual grains of
sand or lumps of mud.
Th© first basis on which Corvallis Sand claims that
th® state cannot maintain ejectment is that th© common law
concept of the ownership of the beds of navigable fresh water
streams controls in this situation.

That doctrine was

announced by this C:mrt in the case of Jones v. Sou lard,
decided in 1860.
Oregon Wi)s admitted to the Union in 1859, and it is
submitted that as >:f the time Oregon became a state, th©
common law controlhad th© ownership of th® beds of navigable
streams, and under the common law th© state's interest did not

?
extend above tidewater.
QUESTION?

What was the basis of federal court

jurisdiction in Jones v„ Soulard?
MR. MIX:
decision.

Do you remember?

Your Honor, it is not vary clear in the

As to jurisdiction, w© take the position there is

jurisdiction her®.

All the property that is involved in 'this

cas© originally was patented out by th® federal government.
Secondly, on the basis of the equal footing doctrine,
which was a basis for jurisdiction also, as I understand it,
in the Bonelli case, also on th© basis on th® fact that th®
Willamette River is navigable ~ and I will get to talk about
that lator — at least until the Bonelli decision? also on
th® basis that th® Oregon court’s ruling which in effect said
that the state has a fee simple title to the bed, is contrary
to Bonelli.
QUESTION:

If your first basis for jurisdiction were

federal jurisdiction, the idea that the land was originally
patented by the federeil government, were adequate to sustain
it, any real property dispute that arise west of th©
Appalachian Mountains you could bring into federal court,
could you not?
MR. MIX:

Yes, Your Honor, and th© Court has stated

this as a basis for jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

in Bonelli.

Well ~
Also in — well, not in Bonelli, the

Well, fch© federal patent aspect is mentioned

Now, Your Honor, my recollection may b® in

error, and apparently it is.

It was not my understanding that

Bonelli involved a boundary between two states.
Another basis for jurisdiction is the problem of
due process, and this again I hop© to discuss later, but it
is on the basis that the riparians became investors with
certain rights that they war® granted under th© common law,
and that those rights have been divested, and particularly in
this situation.

And it should b© pointed out that the states

at least hav© not questioned jurisdiction in previous cases.
Continuing with the basis of Corvallis — of th®
common law being contributing h®ro, under th© common law the
stata held no interest in th© beds of navigable fresh water
streams.

And along cam© a state in 1859, and the common law

was controlling in my view until at least 1876 when the Court
gave th© opinion in Barney v. Keokuk.

The plats involved in

this case are dated approximately 1853, 1859, 1865, and on©
small government lot is datad 1882.

However, that was a home­

stead and not a donation, land claim, and the entryman who had
mad© his entry in his filing in 1875, w© took th© position in

9
th© Oregon courts that his riparian rights related back to
187 5, which would b© before Barney v. Keokuk.

Th© Oregon

court rejected that position.
Th© Oregon court did not, to th© best of my knowledge,
until 1808, in the case of Hum© v. Rogue River Packing Company,
make

a ruling that, the beds of navigable fresh water streams

belong to th© state, and by that time all of these rights had
been vested.
Th© Oregon Legislature did not until 1967 pass a
statute claiming that the state owned the beds of navigable
fresh water rivers.
Nov/, -th© second opinion for ownership by Corvallis
Sand is as follows:

Except in th© line of decisions of the

Court which began in Barney v. Keokuk in 1876, th© state owns
the beds of navigable fresh water streams, but that the state
has th© right to grant, to th© riparian whatever portion of
that title it v/ishes.

And applying that line of opinions, it

is our position that in 1859, when Oregon bacam® a stata, by
constitutional provision, it adopted th© common law, and this
was accomplished by continuing in force the statutes of th©
territory, and one of those statutes made the common law
controlling in all of them.
Now, it is our position that in 1859 Oregon, ©van
though it owned the beds of th© navigable fresh water streams,
mad© an election to apply the common law, and that the

10
riparian received his traditional rights and that it is a
denial of due process to now try to take those rights away
from him.
QUESTIONS

Would you analogize that situation to a

case where Oregon had received lands from th© federal govern­
ment at the time of statehood which war® unrestricted and it
had in turn turned around and conveyed them to private individuals?
MR. MIX:

Yes, Your Honor.

In that situation, you

are talking about new lends, and in that situation th© State
of Oregon would b© in the position of a private landowner.
When it gave land to the riparian, and did not reserve any
rights from the deed, th© entire title would pass, including
th© traditional common law riparian rights.
The third ground, th© position that the state cannot
maintain ejectment is based on Bonelli, which approaches in
many ways, at least in my view, the common law, and again
Bonelli held that th© state's title is limited, that it must
b© related to navigation, it is determinable, th© state's
interest in th® bed is as a bed in my interpretation of water
that is part of the navigation servitude.

The public would

have th© right to anchor on th© bad, as part of th© fishing
servitude, for example, and would have th© right to wad© on
th® bed, to us© the bed for spotting salmon and so on, but
that it is not proprietary.

11
On the basis of -QUESTIONi

As I understand it, you say that at no

time has the sand and gravel company ever interfered or con­
ducted activities that would interfere with these various
rights?
MR. MIX:
is this:

Yes, Your Honor, and my big point of that

Th© Corps of Engineers, under the Coraiuerc© Clause,

issued permits removal of sand and gravel materials, and it is
our position that those permits would not be issued if —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, you need not be

quit© so close to th® microphone.
MR. MIX:

— that th® Corps would not issue those

permits if navigation were being interfered with.

And the

second basis is that the state at. no time pleaded or offered
any evidence that their® was any interference with navigation
or fishery, throughout the case we'v© maintained there was no
interference, and to th© best of my knowledge the state has
naver said there was any interference.
The fourth ground relates solely to -the judgment for
money damages recovered by the 'state, and the state recovered
ad judgment based on the number of cubic yards of material
removed from th© river.
At common law, th© riparian had the right to remove
sand and gravel so long as he did not interfere with th© public
rights.

Bonelli holds again that the state owns the bed as a

12
bad, citing State v. Gill, and in Gill the Alabama court said
that title to the state doss not extend to the individual
grains of stand or lumps of mud, and on that basis w© submit
that the proprietary right of removing sand and gravel is not
owned by the state but belongs to the riparian, and the state
cannot recover damages.
QUESTION:

Your view is, your argument is that the

bed is still the bed, ©van if some of the surface material is
taken off of it?
MR. MIX:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as a matter of river

hydraulics, the river normally replaces the sand and gravel
you remove.

In the next spring or th© n@xt high water, it

washes more material down.
There is a related matter that is not an issue di­
rectly, but it is important, and that is the definition of
navigable or navigability.

There is no question but that in

1971, when this case was tried, that th© definition of
»

navi gamble cipplied to any stream which had historically bean
navigated, irrespective of subsequent ©vents.
The Willamette River was used in the ©arly days as
the main artery of commerce, tha Willamette River.

And again,

I am referring to the area above Corvallis, which is the dis­
puted part.

With the advent of —

QUESTION:

When you say above, do you mean upstream

from or downstream from?

13

MR, MIX?

Upstream from Corvallis, Your Honor.

With the advent of the railroad and the truck, com­
merce disappeared.

Today, the stream is used by fishermen

floating down or people floating down canoes and innertubes
and such.

The historical definitions of navigable ar© derived

from two sources;

First, in the G@ne.se® Chief, in 18 51, the

Court, for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction, held that
admiralty jurisdiction does extend to navigable fresh water.
In 1370, in the case of the Daniel Ball, the Court held that
for purpose of the Commerce Claus®, navigable is to bs d@£inad
as far as fresh water is concerned as thos® streams or bodies
which are capably being used commercially for trade and travel.
Now, the law has been undisputed until BoneHi, that
if a stream was historically navigable, the state's ownership
continued.

It is submitted that definitions of navigability

for purposes of the Commerce Clause and for purposes of
admiralty jurisdiction should ha broad for ptoection of th©
public.

However, when we com© to define navigable for the

purpose of taking from the riparian his rights and giving those
to the statas, th® definition should be restrictive.

And a

suggested definition is that a stream will b© considered
navigable for purposes of -the state's interest in the stream
so long as it continues to bs usabl® for commercial purposes
of trad© and. travel, and the Willamette at this time, in my
judgment at least, is not suitable for that purpose.

14
Now, Bormlli —
QUESTION:

Isn't that kind of a now definition of

navigability?
MR. MIX:

Th© idea of the continuing navigability is

new. Your Honor, that's correct.
QUESTION:

In the finding her®, do w© not to the

contrary, at least on a different -- maybe you would say a
different kind of & definition?
MR. MIX;

Let ma make it very clear.

The last thing

Corvallis Sand wants to do is try to defeat the jurisdiction
of th® Court.

The stream is navigable, the court found it

was navigable, the trial court, and I stipulated it was
navigable, and it was navigable.
My concern is this:

Th© states hava liberalized

this definition of navigable for th© purpose of claiming
ownership to additional land, and Bone Hi at least implies
that th® steta8 s interest ceases if the land ceases to ba
necessary for purposes of navigation,
QUESTION:

Even if ws war® to adopt your restrictive

definition of navigability so that Bonslli would not apply,
th© Supreme Court of Oregon could still develop its own body
of law, could it not, as to whether or not you, your client or
the state owned this particular land?
MR. MIX;

That's not my under st arid, i ng , Your Honor.

Th© definition of navigability or navigabis is for th® federal

15
courts, and there is a long line of decisions holding this.
Secondly, again, I can only stato my understanding of Bonelli
my understanding of Bona ill is that it said that tills area
of the law in the future is to b® the subject of federal
common law.

Bonelli, the situation there was a very limited

situation involving some dry land which had been artificially
created.

Again, it is my understanding that here we are

seeking to explore what law should b© applicabis on a broader
seal® in terms of the
QUESTION:

But you are trying to avoid the applica­

tion of Bonelli, as I understand your argument, by limiting
the definition of navigability, is that correct?
MR. MIX:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, that is not my position.
Well, what is your reason then for wanting

a narrow definition of navigability?
MR. MIX:

For this reason, Your Honor, that again

the states have taken upon themselves to liberalize the defin­
ition to tak® on more property.

And again, if my understanding

of Bonelli is correct, the implication at least is that the
state's interest only continues so long as the water is usable
for purposes of navigation.
QUESTION:

So doesn't that prove what I just asked

you, that you want to narrow th® definition of navigability
so that Bonelli will have lass application?
MR. MIX:

Well, it would limit, shall wa say, th©

16

land area underwater in that sens©, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Okay.

Then, suppose we were to conclude

for one reason or another that Bonalli didn't govern this
case, then wouldn't it be up to the Supreme Court of Oregon to
decida by Oregon law who got the property that is in conflict
here?
MR. MIX;

Not if my understanding is correct, Your

Honor, that we also have a problem of due process hers in the
sens® that these rights became vested — .
QUESTION;

Well, subject to constitutional limita­

tions —
MR. MIX;
QUESTION;

Yes.
™ but what, body of real property law

would you look if Bonelli ware not applicable to this case?
MR. MIX:

Well, Your Honor, prior to Bonelli, the

states had free rein to decide what they chose.
Excuse me, I request to reserve ten minutes, Your
Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE EURGER;

Very wall, Mr. Mix.

Mr. lungerich.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL IUNGERICH, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA, ETC.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court;
I want to begin by thanking th© Stats of Oregon for

17
permitting the State of California and the 21 other states
which join it in advancing the position expressed in our
amicus briefs in this case, an opportunity to present our
position to the Court in oral argument.
Our position is that neither this case nor the
earlier decision of Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona was ever a
federal question arising unde?' federal common law.

And I

submit that this is a very critical question to the states.
Until Bonelli, the nature and extent of the rights of each
state and its lands beneath the navigable, waters within each
state's boundaries wer© questions of state law exclusively
confined to state courts, and we -QUESTION:

Haw about Hughes v. Washington?

MR. IUNGERICH:

Hughes v. Washington, Your Honor, I

submit, relied upon the construction of a federal patent and
is a question there

it involved a federal patent and the

boundary that wa are talking about, wa are talking about
actually defining one of the boundaries of a federal patent,
where you have a federal patent and the construction of that
patent and th© scop© and giving it fore© and effect, such as
in Hughes or in Borax, which is in question, we concede that
there is a federal question.
However, the normal rul© is under Joy v. city of St.
Louis, which is mentioned in on© of the amicus briefs, is that
th© mere fact that a federal patent was the source of title

18

doss not confer jurisdiction on any court.
issue about construction.

There has to be an

In this case, there was no issue

■of construction of th© patent.

The issue here is the effect

of a change brought about by a flood on the Willamette River.
We submit that that is a question purely and simply of state
law, what the effect of that change was.
Now, effectively what we are arguing for is with
regard —* w© submit that, first, under the equal footing
i

doctrine, the equal footing doctrine is properly interpreted,
leaves to the state courts the right to determine under their
own rules of property and in their own form all questions with
regard to the beds of navigable rivers and all questions with
4ft

regard to the changes in those beds that occur later.

Simply

stated, that means that all these questions are state law
questions, as we see. them.
An alternative view, we believe essentially that
that construction is the proper one.

An alternative and per­

haps aqually acceptable construction to the states that argue
as amicus is that if the equal footing doctrine does confer
jurisdiction under the federal Constitution on this Court, it
confers it to define what the incidence of sovereignty are
and no more.

It does not confer a basis for determining ques­

tions under federal common law, and to explain that point and
what I mean by that is this %
Th© Court could say that, as of th© date of admission

19

to the Union, th® states involved under th© equal footing
doctrine? were vested with fee simple title in the beds of all
navigable rivers as to wherever those bads might move in the
future.

However, the line on the analysis of Bomelli, th©

effect of that decision would be that it would acquire title
to the beds of navigable rivers in all states in the state in
full proprietary and all other sovereign aspects and x^ould do
so as a matter of constitutional law, no longer bringing cases
like this before this Court, because any effect of where the
river happened to be flowing, changed by a flood, would leave
those cases out of court.
However, if Bonelli is applied under those circum­
stances, it would mean that th© state cannot rely upon the
equal footing doctrine as a source of title for ralicted beds
or re-emerged land.

But we submit that still does not present

a federal question.

What it creates is a title vacuum, and

that is really what the issue was in Bonelli.
In other words, th© courts, as w*e see it, should
have gone no further than to decide in Bonelli that equal
footing did not confer title on the state.

It should not then

have gone and created a federal common law rule which disposed
of the ralictad bad of tha river and granted it to Bonelli
Cattle Company, because th© question thsre presented is really
a question of state law-, as th© cases of this Court indicate.
Th® effects of accretion, the effects of avulsion, the effects

20

of reliction, all of those questions have always been held by
this Court to be questions for the state courts, not questions
for the federal courts to determine.
And we submit that the basis for this second alter­
native is essentially that, when you decide the equal footing
determines that there was no claim in Bonelli, that equal
footing could be a basis for the state's title.

Really, it

should be up to the state court to decide th© disposition of
the property in question at that point, because the third
section cf the Bonelli opinion begins by stating "th© question
that remains xs as to who owns the subject, land under th©
applicable federal common law."

I submit, however, that th©

partias in Bonelli — and having read the briefs, I submit
this -— indicated that there was no difference between state
and. federal law in this cas©.,

And they did -not bring out any

source of federal jurisdiction for creating a federal common
law principle.
Wa are told in Eri© Railroad v. Tompkins that there
is no longer any general federal common law, so w© must look
to one of tha several sources of specialised common law.

None

of them, which our brief points out, are applicable in tha case
of th© federal common law rules created in the Bonelli de­
cision.

And I think that —
QUESTION:

Well, what about interstate boundaries?

MR. IUNGERICH:

Wall, the court did not rely on th©

21

int@rst.at© boundary in Bonelli.

And I would point out that we

were only talking about land that was wholly within Arizona in
Bonelli.

In other words, we were talking about Arizona owned

from the middle of the .river to the n@w high water mark.

The

remaining —QUESTIONS

Th© river had been at on® time the inter-

state boundary, had it not?
MR. IUNGERICH:

It had at one time — well, it still

is the interstate boundary.
QUESTION;

MR. IUNGERICH:

Th© channel of the river.

I don’t

know exactly the affect of the compact between Arizona and
California on that point at this precis® location, which, of
course, affects that.
critical question.

But the interstate boundary was not th©

If it war®, w© would not b© here, because

I would submit, if there is an interstate boundary and you
are talking about a conflict between two states over an inter­
stat® boundary, that is on© of the areas where specialized
federal common law does apply.

And w© would agree under those

circumstances, but it was land whllly within Arizona, it was
land between the new high water mark and th© old high water
mark, and th®r® was a question purely and simply of stafe© law
that should have been applied.
QUESTION;

Do you think state law has fore© enough

cm your approach to th® case to give th© state title to th©

22
land under a river which has changed — a navigable river
which has changed its course noticeably by an avulsion rather
tli an accretion?
MR. lUNGERICHs
QUESTION s

I think a state could so hold, y©s.

At the time of statehood the river is in a

certain place? under the equal footing doctrine, the state gets
the title to the riverbed as it then is, and then the river
changes course markedly by, say, a quarter of a mil© and the
parson over whose land the river now flows loses title to the
riverbed.
MR. IUNGERICH;
QUESTION;

That's right.

You think the state could h&v© that sort

of a rule?
MR. lUNGERICHs
QUESTION;

Yes, I do.

Without any reliance on any equal footing

doctrine?
MR. lUNGERICHs

Yes, I do. Your Honor.

I think the

reason for -that is —*
QUESTION;

I suppose you hav® to take that position?

MR. lUNGERICHs

Yes, Your Honor, because the whola

purpose of protecting the public’s rights to commerce,
navigation and fisheries depends, as the cases of this Court
teach us, upon the ownership ©f th© bed.

The two ar® related.

And so th® state holds that bed in trust to protect these
public purposes, and it really makes no sons© to talk about

23

the stat® not owning the bed of a major artery such as the
Willamette Rivar, a major navigable river, which is so important
to commerce and to a state and to its public.

So that you

have some portions that are haid in private ownership and other
portions that are held in public ownership.
QUESTIONS

Would you deny that the Oregon courts

could conclude as a matter of Oregon law that the State of
Oregon didn’t have title to this river, to the bed of the
river?
MR. IUNGERICHs

I think the State of Oregon could so

decide and, under those circumstances, many states, such as I
believe Wisconsin and Illinois, have taken the position that
the riparian landowner owns to tha thread of the stream.

And

if a state decides to do that, I submit that that is within
the state's prerogative.

But tha problem her® is whether or

not a federal common law should compel that result, that the
state

give up title to the bad of the river, and that is I

think the critical issue of state sovereignty that is presented
in this case.
QUESTION?

Of course, the state got part of tills

land, didn't they, in the bed of th® new river in this case?
MR. IUNGERICHs

They got part of th® land, yes.

question is the remainder.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER S. HERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF OREGON, ETC.
MR. HERMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

th© Court;
My nam© is Peter Herman, and I represent th®
Attorney General's Office of th© State of Oregon, and am hers
on behalf of th© State Land Board.
I feel some clarifying statements here are in order
in terms of stating the case.

I would like to call the

Court's attention to pages 40 and 41 of th© joint appendix,
th© brawn document.

The chart on the left shows the rivar as

it was in 1890, and th© Court will not® two points, A and B.
This is the neck of th® peninsula and the overflow channel
that was discovered on that date.

Th® chart on th© right,

pag® 41, shows an enlarged overflow channel and a smaller
channel going around the oxbow.

That was th© river as it

existed in 1911, after the change took place.
Now, the holding of the Bonelli Cattle Company, as
w® interpret, the decision, was that public title follows th©
river and its changes to guarantee full public us© and enjoy­
ment, that when the river recedes from riparian property, th©
X

exposed land is no longer needed by th© sfe&t© for public
purpose and therefor© title goes to th© riparian owner.

And

whether 'th® change is sudden or artificial, perceptible or not,
makes no difference.

25
We submit that the rational® should ba applied in
this case to the facts involving Fisher Cut.

And in any event,

even if traditional avulsion doctrina is to ba applied, w®
submit, as a matter of lav/, that no avulsion did in fact
occur.

And in effect what the Court is being called upon to

do here is to review the legal conclusions

the Oregon courts

draw in an essentially agreed upon factual setting.
Now, what happened here was
QUESTION:

Precisely what are the issues that the

state raised in its petition for certiorari?

I take it you

got title to three of these paresis.
MR. HERMANS
QUESTION:

Well, as far as this -/rid b@y©nd fchos® parcels, what issues ar©

you — you aren't raising any issues to thos® parcels, are
you?
MR. HERMAN:

w© are not raising any issues as to

parcels that the state was awarded title.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. HERMAN:

Now, what ar© the issues?

Tho issues we are talking about are

essentially parcels 2A, 23 and a portion of parca1 3, which
ar© called Fisher Cut.

That is the overflow channel that the

Court sees on page 40, and the enlarged chasm©! that th© Court
sees on pag© 41, with the word "Fisher" in it.
Over a twenty-year period, th@r© was much flooding,
there were recurrent storms, some major storms.

In 1890, this

26

chann&l carriad water at an intermediate stag© of five feet.
By 1906, one-fourth of the river was flowing through this
channel at the four-foot stage, which is again an intermediate
stage.

There were som© mor® major storms.

And by November,

sometime after November 25, 1909, the main flow of the river
was found coursing through this overflow channel.
Now, the trial court held that this constituted an
avulsion, that the change was sudden and violent.

The Oregon

Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court essentially agreed and
ruled that the state had no title to the bad in this portion
of the river.

Now, this section of the river is approximately

2,500 feet long, but the court sent the case back to the trial
court to determine the precise limits of the avulsion.
Now, the issue w© have raised in our petition is
whether, under these facts, it was proper for the court to
conclude that an avulsion did occur and that th® public did not
have title to this bed.
Stated another way, wa are contending that this was
not an avulsion, -that Mhe public's title to the river followed
the river as it enlargol over the years, this overflow channel.
Essentially wiat you had her® was a river flowing
around an island at an intermediate stag© and —
QUESTIONS

Mi. Herman, if it is an avulsion, do you

concede that the stats* doss not have title to th® bed of
Fisher's Cut?

27
MR. HERMAN;

Wall, if avulsion doctrina applies,

Your Honor, that would have to be the concession, y©s.

Our

position on that is several points.
First, as a matter of law, there was no avulsion
h@r@.

There was no sudden change ©f channel*

You had in ex­

istence two channels.
QUESTION;
be sure about this.

Y©s, but. let's assume it is.

I want to

If it vers an avulsion, then, you are

content to have a situation where th® State of Oregon does not
own that portion of th® bed of the river?
MR. HERMAN;

If avulsion — if this Court is to

continua holding that avulsion doctrine applies, than that
ends the case.

We submit that —

QUESTION;

Well, I thought the Supreme Court, your

State Supreme Court awarded you three® tracts ©£ land here,
2A, 2B and 2C.
MR. HERMAN:
QUESTION:
MR, HERMANS

Thos® ar® the tracts that are in issue.
All right.

Now, what did they award you?

They awarded ua tracts 1, 5, 6, 4 —

QUESTION:

I s®3.

QUESTION:

And ar® they under th© old channel?

MR. HERMAN;

Wall, actually you have got a combina­

tion her© of old channel and new channel.

The river followed

an oxbow prior to 1890, and part of th® property in dispute
her© is that sara© river.

What happened was, there was an

28

overflow channel across the neck of the oxbow, and that, is the
area of the river that is in issue here in this Court today,
because we are saying that the stata has title to the b@d
under that former overflow channel, which is now the main bed
of th© river.
There is no cont@nt.icm from us concerning th© parcels

No, we are not asking th© Court to

overrule Bonelli, providing that the Court applies what w©
think is th© logical rational®.
QUESTION;

Now, let's assume for the moment that

state law would apply in this case, that Oregon law would
apply, the avulsion and accretion law, I take it you would

No, w© would not com® out th© sam® way,

QUESTION;

Mo, as the court — the result here, you

MR. HERMANS
QUESTIONS

That's correct.
Y©S.

MR, HERMAN:

If state law was applied — well, I arn

going to hav© to raced© from that.

I don't think there has

been another case in the State of Oregon in which the
principle of avulsion has been applied against th© sovereign.
It, has been applied in boundary disputes between riparian
owners, where a river was a monument or a boundary between
two riparian owners.

It has not, to my knowledge, been ap­

plied to say th© state does not. hav® title in the cats© of an
avulsion, and that, of course, is cur principal contention
here, that avulsion doctrine has no place in a case such as
this»
QUESTION 2

This is why you surprise m© in your con­

cession about avulsion.
MR. HERMAN:

Well, may Id© I misunderstood th© Court's

— I caught myself, because if th© Court

of course, the

30
Oregon court applied the avulsion doctrine, relying on Bonelli,
I assume that it would apply the same doctrine ©van if Bonelli
was not relied upon.

However, we would argue in the court, if

it; war© remanded back, that avulsion is not appropriately
applied to the situation like this, because avulsion is a
boundary concept to mark the boundaries between riparian
owners.

It is inappropriately applied in a situation where

the sovereign title is at issue.

And if you ar© going to have

an avulsion doctrine, you are always going to have uncertainty
as to ownership of the riverbed, because you ar© always in the
situation of trying to ©valuation changes of the river, and
there have been hundreds of changes of the Willamette River
since 1859, and you might just as well say that the public
doss not have title, there is no public use and enjoyment,
because you are in the position of always having to litigate
was this or was this not an avulsion.
We are at the Bonelli rational®, which says that the
public’s title follows the river.

There was soma language in

the opinion that indicates that it only follows the river as
to gradual changes.

W© think this word "gradual" raises the

same problem again.

The court was relying upon boundary cases,

whore the issue is where the line is between two states when
the river changes, and those cases where there is a sudden
change, you can observe where the river was and the former
channel of the river remains the boundary, but that rational©

31
is inappropriately applied to a case like this.
QUESTION!

Well, according to the. findings of the

Supreme Court of Oregon, you could certainly tell th® day that
Fisher’s Cut began to carry the majority of the stream.
MR. HERMAN:

Well, I don’t know whether you could or

not, Your Honor, nobody was there to sa@ it, th® witnesses —■
QUESTION"

Well, nobody has been there in the case

where most things have been found avulsion.

It is all a

bunch of early settlers or Indians testifying about boats
going up and down the river and that sort ©f thing, isn’t it?
MR. HERMAN:

Yes.

your question this ways

Well, Your Honor, I would answer

You hatva an avulsion, if you are

going to apply th® traditional doctrine, where there is a
channel change, but I submit there is no channel change when
you hava got bath channels there, and it is just a question of
the water in on® channel changing from the major flow to that
channel to the major flow of the other channel.

And ©v®n if

it is sudden, it is not really -QUESTION:

Well, but those ar© contrary to your po­

sition, as in th® various state courts which hav® treated
questions of state law.
MR. KERMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —
They ar© Eighth Circuit cases.

MR, HERMAN:
Court is referring to.

Well, I am not sure which cas© 'th©
There ar© actually very few cases that

32
have dealt with this issue.

It is mostly boundary disputes.

Tii© Commissioners case was th® closet case I know of , and
that involved a non-navigable stream
between two riparian ewners.

and a boundary dispute

Th® Court relied on that to com©

up th® result it did in this case.
I would like to make on© comment about th© business
of th© rights of riparian owners under Oregon law.

Oregon law

grants the riparian owner no rights below high water unless by
affirmative statute or deed.

It has been th© common law ©f

our stilt© 'that ‘th© riparian owner owns only to high water * and
that what rights he has is by grant of th© state, and that has
been settled law in ©ur state, going back at least as far as
Bowlby v. Shively in 1892, which was in this Court on appeal.
Gur suggestion to this Court is that if federal law
is to fo© applied, and w® do sgr@® with amicus California t©
this extent, that the states should have title and th© state
court should have th© right to decide title in all cases of
river changes, and that ‘th© fact there has been a> so-called
avulsion change, does not deprive the public of title, and th®
state can decide whether the public is to have title in that
case or the riparian owner.
QUESTIONt

Then you are asking for a change in th©

aonalli doctrine, aren't you?
■ MR. HERMAN;
decide the issue?

You mean change as to what court is to

33

QUESTIONS
MR. HERMAN?

Yes.
W® haven’t asked for that* no, because

ws got. what w® considered to b® an unsatisfactory result in
the Oregon court, and wa were happy to petition this Court to
have that result protected.

It would help the state if the

Court agrees with our contention and rules that it has juris™
diction.
It would also help th© state if this Court rules
that it is up to the state to decide under these circumstances
whether the riparian or th© state has title.
QUESTION;

But w© can’t do that and leave Bonelli

completely intact, can we?
MR, HERMAN;

Th© Court would have to modify Bonelli,

I presume, as fco the comments of federal common law, yes.
QUESTION;

But don't you sense seme dissatisfaction

up her© with Bonelli among these questions?
MR, HERMAN;

I sense dissatisfaction nationwide with

Bonelli, Your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. HERMAN;

I wonder why you don’t hit it head-on.
Well, I lik© th© result of Bonelli, or

'■m like th© result of Bonelli.

If th© Court had stopped at

•£h© point of saying that Arisona has no titl® under th© equal
footing doctrine to this barn land, and th© rest of th©
opinion stood, th.© implication would be very clear teat th®
state would still hava title, no matter how the river changed.

34
QUESTIONS

Are you suggesting that we modify or re-

examine at least merely the dicta in BonaHi?
MR. HERMAN;

Yes, although I think the federal

common law is nor© than dicta, because the Court relied on that
to say that Arizona didn't have title to the bar© land, al­
though the Court could have say it. didn't have title to the
bare land just based on the equal footing doctrine.
I think it is appropriate hare to sum up what our
position is.

If the Bonelli case is to apply, w© submit that

it should apply in this case and the Oregon courts would have
bo be reversed because the rational® of Bonelli is that title
follows th© river and the character of the change is immaterial,
both as to the riparian and as to th© public.

W© feel that

th© sam© rational© should apply to both sides.
If th® Court is to modify Bonelli, it seems to us
that that part of the opinion that in effect rules th® state
has title tinder the Constitution or under th© equal footing
doctrine as to th© river, wherever it lies, would require remand of the case back to the Oregon courts to deal with th©
fact that their decision is inconsistent with the way this
Court would interpret Bonelli under those circumstances, and
leave to the Oregon courts and th© legislature to decide how
■the title should b© apportioned between th® riparian owner and
th© state.
QUESTION;

Do you understand your state courts to

35
have held that there was an avulsion in this case?
MR. HERMANS

They held 'there was an avulsion in this

case, yes.
QUESTIONS

And now you think that if federal law

applies, w® should not necessarily accept their finding as to
avulsion?
MR. HERMAN?

They should not accept it, bacause w©

submit both as a matter of law, whether you ar® looking at
traditional avulsion doctrine or looking at the equal footing
doctrine under Bonelli, this was not an avulsion.

And it was

not an avulsion because it was a twenty-year process.

In fact,

one-fourth of the river was going through this channel in 1906
and it didn’t change until November of 1909, so I submit that
this is a matter of classical, avulsion.

That is not an

avulsion.
QUESTION?

You would suspect — if you accept the

finding of avulsion, you would, I take it from what you. said
before, would anticipate the same result under Oregon law as
■under federal law, if this was an avulsion?
MR. HERMANs

Well, if it is and the Court rules that

it is still up to the state to decide —
QUESTION;

Yes.

Let’s assume that we decided that

federal law governs -- federal law does not govern, but that
state law does, would you think that the Oregon courts would
com» out with the same result?

36
MR, HERMAN:

I think I would rather not predict

that/ because I would want to argue the point that this really
is not an appropriate doctrine to apply when the state is the
sovereign and the owner of the bed, and the issue is whether
the state has title to where the river now flows,
want to argu© that

I would

we would want to argue that point again

and get the Court to r©-examine its thinking, particularly
sine® this is the first ease where the state was'involved in
this matter that has com© up in th® State of Oregon that I am
aware of.
QUESTION:

Let’s —-

the Oregon court her© got

around to saying that they didn’t think ‘th© state really neaded
ownership of th@s@ tracts under this navigabis stream, but th®
state’s total sovereign interest could be served in other ways.
MR. HERMAN:

or

Th© stats was answering our contention

it interpreted our argument to mean that w® should get

title because w® needed it/ even though it was avulsion/ and
our argument/ of course/ was that we needed title and it was
not an avulsion and that ©ur argument had substance to it, it
wasn't, just a technical contention that we should have title
because it was nice to have title.
QUESTI®!:

Under Oregon law, Mr. H©rman, is th© de­

termination of an avulsiv© change a mixed question of law and
fact?
MR. HERMAN:

I think that states it perfectly, Mr.

37

Justice Burg®r, because the facts in this case really are not
in dispute.,

It is the conclusions that the court drew from

those facts that wa are arguing about.
QUESTION;

Do you think wa have any authority to

draw different inferences and conclusions from —
MR. HERMAN:

I submit you do, Your Honor, ia an

agreed upon setting of facts, you are not really making a dif­
ferent finding of fact, because what the Oregon courts did was
draw a legal conclusion that from these facts w® hold that an
avulsion occurred.

It really was more of a legal conclusion,

because the facts are essentially in agreement.
QUESTION?

But doss this Court ordinarily re-examine

the highest court of a state on a determination of state law?
MR. HERMAN:

Well, -this was not a determination of

state law.
QUESTION::
time now.

Well, I am just taking it on® step at a

On state law, w© don’t re-examine, do w@?
MR. HERMAN:

If there is a federal question in-

that are drawn from the agreed upon facts.

That is what you ar© suggesting now, is

that because the federal question is at least hovering her© —
MR. HERMAN:

ical avulsion.

Then we aren’t here at all.
Right.
Mr. Herman, you say this was not a class-

It. certainly wasn’t a classical accretion

either, was it?
MR. HERMAN:

It falls almost precisely within the

case of Commissioners v. United States, Your Honor, which is
cited in the brief.

It is classified as an exception to the

accretion doctrine, because what the river did was crawl
around and create a new channel, and how long that took w®
don’t know, but w© know it took twenty years after the channel
was discovered before it became the main channel of the river.
QUESTION:

But w@ also know there was a precis©

point in time at which on© channel ceased to bear the main
part of the current and the other on© did, from the findings
of the court, do w© not?
MR. HERMAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor, sometime

after November 25, 1909.

Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Herman.

Mr. Mix, you have about nine minutas left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MIX, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CORVALLIS SAND AND GRAVEL CO. — REBUTTAL
MR. MIX:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Clearing up one basic fact matter, the land in dispute
can bs divided into two types,

A comparably small portion of

it was under the channel 'that is being disputed as to whether
or not it was avulsive.

Th® balance ©£ it upstream was in th©

original bed of the river, and I submit this creates two dif­
ferent problems.
My concern here is the right of th© riparian.

Being

very candid, if the» Court, had not, starting with Barney v.
Keokuk, handed down a line of decisions on federal authority,
taking the ownership of the bad from th® riparian and giving
it to th© state, w© wouldn't be her® today, because all states
except Louisiana adopted th® common law, and there was no
question as to what th© common law meant.

It was only whan

the Court said th© states own th© fcsds, that they may decide
what disposition they ar® going to make of them, that we found
ourselves in the situation w© ar© in today.
On that basis, Boa®Hi becomes vary important be­
cause it points the way to a return to what was th© law of th©
land.

And it should ba pointed out that in 1876, when Barney

40

was dacidad, 38 states had already been admitted to th© Unio»,
and in th® territories not yet granted statehood it is safe
to assum® that the principal riparian land had been occupied.
QUESTION:

Did th© Court in Barney say what its

authority was for deciding the matter as a federal question?
MR, MIX:
QUESTION?
MR. MIX:
have been.

It did not, Your Honor.
Was it a diversity case?
It was not, is my understanding.

It could

It was a railroad case, and the railroad might not

have been a resident, but the case doesn’t say that.
QUESTION:

It conceivably could have been a Swift v.

Tyson case, couldn’t it?
MR, MIX:
Honor.

I am not familiar with th® case, Your

Again, by 1876, most of th© important riparian land in

this country was occupied by riparians.

And then Barney v.

Keokuk was handed down and the riparian started to have his
rights taken away from him.

Again, emphasizing th® du® process

aspect, there is even more than that»

Thera is the problem of

th® court taking jurisdiction a hundred years ago, and if it
is now going to be declared that th© court doesn't have jurisdiction, th® riparian is left at the mercy of th® states.

And

there is a very practical aspect of this.
i

Stating this hypothetically ~ but it is v@ry real —
wo take a riparian in State A, and State A’s supreme court has
decided, as Oregon has .sad as Mr. Herman said, that the

4.1
riparian has no rights bales# high water.

Immediately across

this navigable rivor is state B, and Stata B has ruled 'that
the riparian owns to the midfil© ©£ th® stream.

They ar© both

under th© common law, they are both under th© applicable constitutions,

How in that situation do we explain to A that

the state can actually com© in and take the portion of th®
b®d in front of your property, sell it off s© long as it
doesn't interfere with navigation — and let's talc® between
high and low water, for ©xample -- someone can fill it in,
build a building and you, A, have no rights left.
/

Mow, while Bonedli is in dispute her©, there is
certainly one thing said in Bone Hi that should not in my
judgment bo in dispute, and that is that riparianness is im­
portant.

And there is no reason under our jurisprudence for

saying to a riparian, you do not occupy the sam© status as
other property owners in this country.

There is no reason to

discriminate against th® riparian when the courts ar® dedicated
to protecting th© property rights in other types of situations.
Th© common law, ©s it applied at least until 1865,
would resalva all of these problems.

We wouldn't hav® to

argue —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Mix, could you help m© a little bit

on the federal question issue.

You argue that a uniform rule

is desirable, but your theory of federal jurisdiction, as I
understand it, is that there ar® patents involved and th® equal

42

footling doctrine and the fact -that the river is navigable.
Those are your three bases for federal jurisdiction.

Would you

explain to me what is th© relevance of the fact there is
•

4»

patented land involved?
MR. MIX;

Referring to at least two decisions of

this Court, the Borax Ltd. cas© and the Hughes cas© —
QUESTIONS

In Hughes, they war© construing the patent

of the prior owner, I believe, w@r@ th@y not?
MR. MIX:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Year Honor.
But you are not arguing any basis of con-

struction on a prior owner of this Fisher Cut, are you?
MR. MIXs

Well, w@ are contending, Your Honor, yes.

W© ar® th© owners by means of conveyances of the property
which was originally patented out by th© federal government,
and it is our position that when that property was received
from th© federal government, as part of it the riparian rights
passed and that we have succeeded to those rights by th© moan
conveyances, and that this is a matter of federal lav;, in
interpreting -that patent, that 'th© state can't com© along and
say, now, even though you have a federal patent, you've got
nothing beyond th© high water mark.
QUESTION;
MR. MIX:

Thank you.
Again, very briefly, the common law, it is

applied, we will not have these problems of avulsion, what is
navigable.

It is a very simple matter to determine th© head

43
of tides water.
Turning briefly to th® matters fch® state has raised,
the lav; goes back to the Romans, that if a river changes its
channel and flows over private property, the private landowner
does not lose his title»

We are not talking about riparian

rights, w© are talking about th® law of submergence.

And the

riparian continuos to maintain title subject to the public
navigational servitude.

And disagreeing with California’s

position, the state doesn’t need fee title to the bed to protect the public, and we knew this is true because in approxi­
mately twenty states in this country, tfe© state has declared
or has adopted th© common law and th© riparian owns th© b@d,
and there is no record to my knowledge of th© riparian
successfully interfering with th© public rights.
QUESTION?

It is —

And th® Oregon courts decided likewise in

this case, with respect to the three tracte of land?
MR, MIX:

Y©s, to the avulsive challenge, yes, Your

Honor, that is correct.

And this is an illustration of the

lack of need of fee title in th© state.

And what w® ar© dis­

puting here really is its proprietary right of the riparian
os. th© on® hand versus th© right of the public; t© us® the water
on th© other, and there is no real conflict except that on© is
created hypothetically by saying, well, we hold it in trust.
But I submit that is a misapplication of th© trust doctrine.
Thank you.
