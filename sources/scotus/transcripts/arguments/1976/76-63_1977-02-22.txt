MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 76-63, Hunt, the Governor of North
Carolina, against Washington State Apple Advertising Commission,
Mr. Jordan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. JORDAN, JR., ESQ.,
Oil BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLANTS
MR. JORDAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In 1971 the State of North Carolina enacted a general
statute requiring that "no grade other than the applicable
U.S. grade" be shown on closed containers or apples sold or
offered for sale in North Carolina.
In 1973 the statute was amended to include the
words "or shipped", an amendment which was probably not
necessary, but to make a material amendment making the U.S.
grade the exclusive grade marking on closed containers.
The statute has at all times, both in 1971 and in
1973 applied to apples grown within North Carolina as well as
apples grown elsewhere, and, furthermore, there has never, at
any time, been any prohibition on the labeling of apple
containers so as to state that they were grown in Washington
or in any other jurisdiction.
May we quickly explain that apples are graded by the
use of terms such as "extra fancy", "fancy83, “No. 1" and so

4
forth.

These grades can be arbitrarily changed from year to

year by various agencies of the thirteen commercial appla~
growing States.

J^nd apparently this

is sometimes done to

create a market for a particular quality of apples.
Indeed, the Washington State Director of Marketing
has this power and has changed the Washington State grade since
this controversy began.

Thus, what was a "fancy” apple last

year may not be this year, although the name is the same.
The General Assembly of North Carolina exercised the
police power of the State to prevent confusion in the wholesale
marketplace, where apples are sold in closed containers and
not. available for ready viewing by professional apple purchasers.
QUESTION:

Is your State, North Carolina, one of the

thirteen States that commercially produce apples?
MR. JORDAN:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And would it be. true that apples produced'
in your State, and sold to wholesalers in your State, would
not b© in closed containers?
MR. JORDAN:

Not necessarily so.

I believe that the

practice in North Carolina is the same as - the practice in
Washington.

Some are sold in closed containers intrastate and

some are not.
QUESTION: But all apples imported into North
Carolina from Washington and sold to wholesalers in North
Carolina would be in closed containers, is that right?

5
HR. JORDAN s

Yes, Your Honor.

Nov/, by use of the U.S. grade only, there can be no
arbitrary manipulation of labels between Fancy and Extra Fancy,
whether by North Carolina or by any other jurisdiction. The
federal grades axe the only uniform and consistent grades.
The Washington State Apple Advertising Commission
filed a suit for declaratory judgment that the statute is
unconstitutional and prayed that enforcement be permanently
enjoined.
A three-judge district court sitting in North
Carolina held that the statute contravened the commerce clause
and enjoined its enforcement in so far as it precluded fch©
display of the Washington State grade on the containers, but
it did not strike down the requirement of the North Carolina
statute that the U.S. grades must b© shown.
And the Court v/ill recall, as 1 indicated a moment
ago, that that goes all the way back to the 1971 enactment, the
original enactment by the General Assembly.
Three questions are presented by the appeal. They
are the standing of the Washington State Commission to bring
•this action? the jurisdictional amount; and the district
court’s determination that the North Carolina statute contra­
vened -die commerce clause.
May it please the Court, we would like to

briefly

address each of those, and, first, to address fch© threshold

6
questions of standing and the jurisdictional amount requirement,
We respectfully submit that the Advertising
Commission*s pleadings do not contain the necessary allegation
of injury in fact to establish standing.

Rather, the complaint

alleges an injury to individuals who are not parties to this
action.

I will com© to the action in a representative capacity

in a moment.

At. this time, may it please the Court, I am

talking about an action by the Commission for itself.
Now, the plaintiff is an advertising activity.

It's

interesting to note that there is a self~s@rvi.ng portion of the
statute creating the Advertising Commission, and it is set
out in the Appendix, elaborately stating that it was enacted
within the police power of the State of Washington.

The very

thing which is before us ultimately under the commerce clause,
when we test the North Carolina statute.
QUESTION?

Would you agree that the Washington

Commission performs substantially the functions of the
traditional trade association of growers or manufacturers?
MR. JORDAN!

No, sir, w© respectfully disagree.

And I will ~~
QUESTION: Do you think the district court's reference
in the opinion to the association was a Freudian slip then?
MR. JORDAN;

May it please Your Honor, I believe that

the district court misread -the Warfch case and others, because
there we were referring to associations.

This is not an

7

association.
QUESTION: This is a State governmental agency,
isn!t it?
MR. JORDAN:
the Court.

That's exactly what it is, may it please

Not a single grower in the State of Washington has

any option about this matter’ whatsoever.

He is assessed, and

he pays, and the Commission then spends his money to advertise
his apples.
He can't refuse to join, may it please Your Honor;
he is an individual who pays the Commission to do this, but
there is nothing which disqualifies hira, if he is injured by
the North Carolina statute, from bringing an action. And
certainly if his injury exceeds $10,000, he could bring it
in the federal court; if it does not, he could bring it in the
State court.
QUESTION:

But you would say that this State agency

does not perform substantially the same functions as a trade
association?
MR. JORDAN:

Your Honor, I would say it does not.

Its principal function is advertising, and if you will look at
the complaint, even in its amended form, with the second bite
at tii@ cherry, all that Washington State contends that the
Washington State Advertising Commission doss in the State of
North Carolina is advertise. They say, ”V7@ spent $25,000 in
advertising

8
Well, there is nothing in the North Carolina statute
which says you cannot advertise»

Every carton coining into

North Carolina can display in the largest possible wordage
'’Washington State Apples", and, indeed, in hearings before the
North Carolina Advertising Commission, we showed that that was
being done, and we have no objection to it» We welcome their
advertising that they were grown in Washington,
What we ar© saying, though, is to put the Washington
State grade on the carton, on the closer container, is
offensive to the North Carolina statute because within the
police power the General Assembly of North Carolina found that
there was confusion in the marketplace —■
QUESTION;

You* re talking now about standing, aren't

you?
MR. JORDAN;

Your Honor, I am»

I'm getting ahead of

myself, and
QUESTION;
MR» JORDAN;

Yes»
— if I may return to my notes.

The Linda case in 1973, which is cited to this Court
so often, reaffirmed the requirement that a party seeking
review must itself have suffered an injury, and when the
constitutionality of a statute is attacked, the party invoking
jurisdictional power must show that it has sustained direct
injury as a result of the statute's enforcement.
And there, both the Sierra Club case and the Warfch

9

case say that it must appear in the complaint.

That's the —

QUESTIONs Excuse me, would you say that the plaintiff
would have standing if the statute said there shall he no
advertising on the containers?
MR. JORDAN;

There w© run into a question, of course,

of commercial freedom of speech, which we do not think is
relevant in this case, because we do not say that you can.
QUESTION;

No, I'm asking you if the statute said

that, do you think the plaintiff in this case would have
s tanding?
MR. JORDAN;

That plaintiff would have standing,

I would
QUESTION:

But isn't this statute similar to that

in that it limits th© kind of
the container?

advertising that can go on

In other words, that says you may not advertise

the Washington grade on the container.
MR. JORDAN:

I think I follow

Your Honor's thinking

in that, in that Judge Dupre® sitting alone, in passing on the
jurisdictional question — at our own request? w© filed a lette
with him, asking him if he would do that sitting alone, before
the three-judge panel was convened -- Judge Dupre© referred to
commercial advertising, in saying that the Commission had this
right to advertise.
Biit, of course, looking again to the two recent
Virginia cases before this Court on commercial advertising,

10

they do not say that you can't regulate.

And here,, all we're

saying is that you may advertise where your apples came fronts
but you can’t confuse the wholesale purchaser by having
multiple grades.
QUESTION:

What you're saying, in effect, is that

putting the grades on the label is not a legitimate form of
advertising. And if you say that, haven't you conceded standing,
is what I’m getting at.
MR. JORDAN:

Only to this extent:

that if other

advertising is permitted, then the degree of advertising, which
is the — the degree test which is applied to commercial
advertising,under the First Amendment, is met.
And, as we say,they can put any kind of identifica­
tion in the world on that.

This is different, may it pleas©

the Court, from the Arizona case in which the Court held that
Arizona couldn’t require that the name "Arizona produced'*
appear on the cantaloup© cartons.
QUESTION;

Mr. Jordan, can you explain to m© why

the. Court of Appeals did not discuss the standing point?

Other

than to say that it had been decided.
MR. JORDAN:

May it please Your Honor, the Court of

Appeals directed us — or, rather, the three-judge district court
directed us to go directly into the arguments on the merits,
stating that it was accepting the memorandum and order of Judge
Dupree, who heard it alone.

11
QUESTION: So it wasn’t discussed?
MR. JORDAN:

It was not discussed before the three-

judge panel.
Now# I'd like to move very quickly to whether the
Commission may bring it in a. representative capacity# because#
obviously, that is the next hurdle that we must cross.
Now# we say it cannot# as I indicated a moment ago
to the Chief Justice# because 'this is not an association within
the sans© of a single association case that has been before this*
Court.

Not one that we can find.
And I hope X am not misstating the situation.
QUESTION: Suppose# instead of designating this

Commission# the Legislature of Washington had used the word
wassociation*8 and had spoken in terras of memberships? would
your view be the same because of the alleged exercise of
police power?
MR. JORDAN:

May it please the Court# I would look

still to the nature of the- organisation. And when we look at
the nature of this organ!zation# as set forth in the Appendix#
we sea what its function really is. And that is to assess the
apple growers and obtain money to advertise apples, and to do
research into improving the growing of apples in the State of
Washington# which is admittedly a major crop there.
QUESTION:

What do trade associations do that this

Commission does not do?

12
MR* JORDAN s

Trad© associations, may it pleas© Your

Honor, first, and I think the distinguishing characteristic,
is trade associations are voluntary organisations, which —
QUESTION; Well, a union is still a union, even if
people are compelled to join it, are they not?
MR, JORDANs
QUESTION;

Yes, it is, Your Honor*
Well, why

Is it. not?
But we think —

is the compulsion a dispositive

factor in your mind?
MR, JORDAN; Because there is no option on the part
of the members in a controversy of this kind ~ well, to
start with, there is no option on the part of the members as to
whether they wish to participate or not.
Now, there is an option, certainly, as to whether a
person wants to belong to a union or not.
Her®, if you are going to be an apple grower in the
State of Washington, you are going to belong to this advertising
agency whether you want to or not.
QUESTION;

I didn't think it was a matter of

belonging, I thought it was a matter of having a burden
assessed in sort of a quasi tax by a governmental agency.

I

didn't know that this council had members.
MR. JORDAN;

This council, this Advertising Commission

has representatives from the growing and warehousing segments
of the apple industry in the State of Washington, may it please
tile Court, and they are elected by districte according to the

13

Washington statute# as it appears in the Appendix.
QUESTION? But growers do not belong to this# they are
simply taxed to support it.
HR. JORDANs
QUESTION:

That's right.

That is correct.

Perhaps your use of the term "belonging5*

was the saia© kind of a Freudian slip as the district court made
when they referred to "association".
MR. JORDAN;

Perhaps so# Your Honor.

But we also think there is another distinction her©#
and that is one which this Court has pointed out in other
cases. There is no disability on a single one of these growers
from bringing an action if# indeed# it is injured.
Now# I know there is an affidavit in here# and this
brings to mind the Warth casas.

An affidavit in hare which

says — in which the Director of Marketing of Apples of the
State of Washington says that he owns an orchard. But it’s
significant that ha never says he*s been injured whatsoever
by the North Carolina statute.
And surely if he had been injured# he would have said
so.
In the Warth case# the opinion points out that there
was one member of the council who actually pleaded that he had
been injured. But still this Court said one is not enough
to make the counsel the proper party.

And in that case title

Court did not go along with the court below.

14
No'??, 1 would like to point out, because it's a very
important part of this case, Mr» Brownlow's affidavit, on
pages 103 and 107 of the Appendix, inadvertently misstates the
genesis of the North Carolina law.
Nov/, actually, it was passed in 1971, two years; before
this controversy began.

Not in response to the appearance of

the Washington State Apple Advertising Commission before the
North Carolina Board of Agriculture.

It was in 1973 that the

change was made, because of the constant and persistent refusal
of the State of Washington to obey the law.

Every other apple­

growing State shipping into North Carolina was obeying the law.
Then, so the 1973 session of the State added the
words that it would be the exclusive marking, whether they were
North Carolina apples, Washington apples, Virginia apples —
and of course wa have no greater competitor in North Carolina
than

these delicious Virginia apples.
But North Carolina did not change the rules after

the controversy began.

No, indeed.

But Washington did.

It

went in and changed its grades and upped them to -the equivalent
United States grades.
Now, the harsh fact is that should they prevail here
today, they can go back to Washington and change those —
lower those grades, change them back to what they were before.
If I —
QUESTION5

You have now left the question of standing,

15
have you?
MR. JORDAN:

Yes.

I would like to talk just a word on jurisdictional
amount.
QUESTION;

You didn’t mention parens patriae,, as a

theory.
MR. JORDAN;

No# sir# I have not covered that in our

brief# either# frankly.
On jurisdictional amount# the only specific allega­
tion in the complaint — and again I refer to the insistence
of this Court

that this b© determined from the allegations in

the complaint.

This is in Sierra Club# this is in Warth # and

the only thing you find there is the $25#000 spent on behalf
of the Commission in advertising in the State of North Carolina.,
Well# they are welcome to continue to advertise in
the State of North Carolina. There is no prohibition on that.
So they have to then go to the question of aggregation
of claims.
Now# we find no c&s© precisely in point# and that
is not surprising.

But there are analogous casos.

The Zahn

case# which we cite# involved four property owners claiming
injury by water pollution caused by a paper company# and this
Court held that thair claims could not be aggregated to
provide the $10 #000.
If that’s true# every single marketing association in

16
North Carolina could have ten growers coming into the federal
courts — I say in North Carolina? in the nation, and there
must h® tans of thousands of them — coming into the federal
courts and saying, "I'm injured $1,000”? ten of them, that's
$10,000«,

These sr© matters which this Court has persistently
said should b© treated in the State courts.
Now, there is an interesting contradiction in what
the district court did in this regard.

The Brownlow affidavit,

which appears on page 17 of the Appendix, attempts to meet the
jurisdictional requirement which was not in the complaint,
it's just not there.

But they say that -the requirement — they

estimate that it costs from 5 to 15 cents a box to obliterate
the Washington State grade from what they allege ar© preprinted
containers.
Now, the evidence is in dispute on that.

There is

an affidavit to the contrary there, as to whether they ar©
all preprinted or not.
But, in any ©vent, the district court accepted this,
and, Mr. Justice Marshall, it was referred to by Judge Dupree
and Judge Craven who wrote fox: the three-judge court specifically
put it in his footnote 9 in great detail. So obviously the
court felt that this was the basis for the jurisdictional
amount.
But what did the court do?

Th® court struck down

17
the requirement which put the Washington growers to this
expense, but left intact the requirement that they show the
U.S. grade,
Nov/, mathematically, obviously one cancels out the
other, and you are left with a zero.
Now, our point is that if you can't aggregate, there
is absolutely no way to reach the jurisdictional point

* the

jurisdictional amount in a representative capacity.
Now, to speak very quickly on the merits, I'd like to
remind the Court that less than one percent of the Washington
production is involved

less than one percent of the

Washington apples shipped are involved in this case.

And

that must be considerably less than one percent of the total
production.

Now, that's the backdrop for the exercise of the

— or the application of the balancing theory.
Now, there was a ease in the Thirties, Justice
Brandeis speaking for the Court held that it was proper for
Oregon to require standard containers for raspberries and
strawberries.

Obviously interstate shippers were required to

go to the expense of using a different container from that
permitted by other States than Oregon.
Nov/, Mr. Justice Brandeis pointed out, and let ms say
with candor, he distinguished, he used soma language which
distinguished that opinion from the opinion that we seek in
this case. Because ha said that the plaintiff was. a manufacturer

18

of crates, it was not a grower, a producer» Thar© is that
difference.
And he went on to say -that actually probably inter­
state commerce is not involved because the real crux of what
we*re talking about her© is intrastate»
But Mr» Justice Brandeis went on to point out one
factual tiling that comes home in this case.

He said:

"There

are 34 other styles or shapes of berry baskets in use somewhere
in the United Statas? obviously a multitude of shapes and
sizes of packages tends to confuse the buyer,"
And then h© specifically applied the police power
test to that kind of factual situation, and he said:

The

order here in question deals with a subject clearly within
«die scopa of the police power, when, such legislative action
is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can
be conceived -that would sustain it, there is a presumption
of the existence of that state of facts? and one who assails
the classification must carry the burden of showing by a resort
to common knowledge or other matters which may ba judicially
noticed or to other legitimate proof that the action is
arbitrary»
This record shows the contrary» This record shows
that sine© the North Carolina statute was passed, the quality
of apples coming into North Carolina has improved.

This

record shows that th© United States Department of Agriculture,

19

conducting an independent survey of the apple Industry from
one ocean, to the other, found that what North Carolina had
don© had had a salutary effect, and recommended that every
apple-growing State do the same thing.
The General Assembly of North Carolina, hearing
witnesses from the apple indue;try, enacted this statute within
the exercise of its police power. Thera is an affidavit in
this Appendix from a gentleman whose name, if I recall, is
Barber, who has been in the apple business for fifty years?
he pointed out that the us© of multiple grades was not only
confined to what appears on the container, on the closed
container, but that apples are sold by price lists which are
circulated, and I believe by telegram or by wire or
electronically in soma way, and that when all of these
different grades appear on that list, and that when multiple
grades, a federal and a State grade both appear on that list,
it's confusing to the buyers.

And that prices are depressed

in this way.
Now, it has been shewn that in North Carolina the
growers there, since 1971, have bean using the United States
grade only.

That has improved the quality of domestic apples.

That is in this record.
. What it seeks to do now — and no other State
«•*

significantly raises any protest, ©vary other State, apple­
growing State has acquiesced in what North Carolina is trying to

20

do.
It is contended by the State of Washington that this
statute discriminates in favor of North Carolina growers. But
nowhere, nowhere in the record or in the brief, are we shown
how on earth does it. discriminate in favor of North Carolina
growers.
QUESTION: Mr. Jordan, does North Carolina provide &
State grading system for apples?
MR. JORDANs

It uses, by statute, may it please Your

Honor, the federal grades.

However, the statute provides that

you need not grad© if you do not wish to, where you use a
closed container. And of course that also applies to Washington
or any other State shipping into North Carolina.

I believe the

same is true of Virginia.
QUESTION: Does that mean that the box containing the
apples is not required, to have any grade at all?
MR. JORDAN;

Yes, Your Honor, -that is true. And

that seemed to bother Judge Craven,
QUESTION: Well, may I follow that up?
MR. JORDAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
How does it serve the purpose of informing

the market as to the grades of apples, if the container may
contain no grade at all?
MR. JORDAN: We have this situation;

when apples come

in in. a closed container, and this has been agreed by all

21
parties# this was agreed in the oral argument before the
fehre©»judge court# that we are really talking about apple
transactions at the wholesale level# where you’ve got experts#
men who have spent their life# like Mr, Barber who spent
fifty years buying and selling apples# men who look at apples
and determine visually what that apple is worth,

But whan an

apple is sold in a closed container# whether it’s grown in
Washington or in North Carolina# and when it's bought or sold
from one of these price lists# which are transferred either
electronically or by telegram or mail# you go by whether it
says it is Fancy# Extra Fancy# an Ordinary or U.S, 1# or
Washington 1# or what.
But the professional buyer knows that -- by the grade,,
that this is going to call for the best price. This is going
to b© the best grade.

If there is no grade# then that’s -an

apple that's going to b® used for applesauce or vinegar or
cider# or whatever the other uses for apples are. This is
known within th© trade# this is trade custom.
It's where they are available for visible determina­
tion that no grade is really necessary.

It's where they ar©

marked in a closed container that th© buyer has to have some­
thing to guide him. And if there is nothing on it whatsoever,
then th© buyer knows he is hot in th© Fancy# th© Extra Fancy#
the No, 1 category anyway.
Now# of course# he has a right# and it is exercised#

22
to open that container and look at those apples, and give them
a manual, visible inspection»
QUESTION;

Mr. Jordan, the statute doesn't prohibit

the use of fch© various grades for the purpose of quoting
prices or reporting prices or anything like that, does it?
MR. JORDAN:

No, sir, it does not.

It just refers to

their presence on closed containers.
I see my time is up.

I'd like to sum up with just

on© words
W© feel that ultimately the principal thrust of the
Apple Commission's position is ‘that the North Carolina statute
does not meat fch© balance of interest test.

That is, that

for a State regulation to be constitutional, its benefits
must outweigh the burden on interstate commarce»

In this

content, the ’whole cor© of this case can be considerably
restricted.
It boils dawn to whether the desire of a given
State to advertise its State grad© on less than on© percent of
its total volume of apples shipped outweighs fch© ©xercis© of
the police power of the State of North Carolina through its
General Assembly, when- the record shows that while, the statute
was in effect, the quality of apples shipped into North
Carolina improve? the Confusion was eliminated? and that the
State's action received the. laudatory commendation of experts
surveying such matters for the

u.

S, Department of Agriculture.

When 'the balancing test is applied to these facts ,
we respectfully submit that the action of the General Assembly
should pjreva.il,
I thank the Court,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well, Mr. Jordan.

General Gorton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :
The production and sale of apples has played a major
role in the economy of the State of Washington for many decades,,
As a result, the State itself has shown a considerable interest
in the apple business.

Some sixty years ago, Washington was

the first jurisdiction in the United States to promulgate
apple grades, anticipating the federal grading system by some
fifteen years.
But finer© &r© several even more vital distinctions
between the two grading systems.

The federal system is optional

only. The apple packer may choose to use it or to ignore it,
without penalty.
The Washington State system, on the other hand, is
mandatory.

No apples may b© packed or shipped in or from the
*

State of Washington unless they have been graded and unless
•fell© grade is marked on the container.

24
The federal grading system permits the packer himself
to grad© his own applesf subject only to someone’s later
challenge.
The Washington State system, on the other hand,
mandates grading by independently employed inspectors.
In summary, the federal system requires neither
grading nor inspection. The Washington State system requires
both.
The U. S, Department of Agriculture, therefore, has
explicitly declined to preempt the field of apple grading or
inspection.

And no issue of preemption is involved in this

case whatsoever.
While some 36 States — not 13, Mr. Justice Stewart
grow apples in commercial quantities, 30 percent of all of
the apples grown in the United States are grown in Washington,
and 50 pereant of all fresh apples sold in interstate commerce
in closed containers originate in the State of Washington.
In fact, from one relatively small portion of the
State, on the east slope of the Cascade Mountains.
Aa a result of this combination of facte, a number
of developments in the apple business were either logical or
almost inevitable, or both.
In our State, one such development was a detailed end
careful Stats regulation of th© apple business, to insure the
quality and the reputation of Washington apples. That regulation

25
includes our mandatory grading and inspection system, and a
State grading system which is more rigorous for the top
Washington grades, Extra Fancy and Fancy, than are the compar­
able voluntary federal grades.

In addition, Washington is the only State in which
there is extensive use of what*s called controlled atmosphere
storage, a system permitting a year-round supply of fresh
apples from one harvest to the next.
Obviously, such a regulatory system assures quality
at a relatively high price, to which is added the punishingly
high costa of transportation to markets thousands of miles
away.

Nevertheless, Washington apples compete successfully

with the local product, ©van in the East and in th© South.
As a matter of fact, that competition is too intense
for tit© taste of the apple growers of North Carolina, and that
is really why we’r© here today.
QUESTION:

Well, on® of -the reasons you’re her©

today is whether or not your client had standing to sue.

And

now you* re going to get to that —
ME. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, I will be addressing that.
— and it seems to me the threshold

question. But, so long as you’re going to get to that, that’s
fin©.
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

In 1973, the North Carolina Legislature

not only

26

banned bub made criminal the use of grades other than U»S»
grades on closed containers of apples shipped to or sold in
'that State»
A year later, on our protest, the North Carolina
Commissioner of Agriculture wrote us and said, and I quotes
”X naturally want to have the sentiment from our apple
producers" — on a change in the law -** "since they were
mainly responsible for this legislation being passed»"

End

of quote.
And quite obviously we obtained no relief.
Now, the North Carolina statute contains a number of
interesting and relevant features»

First, the statute does

not require any apples shipped to or sold in the State to be
either graded or inspected at all.

Second, the statute does

not apply to any fruit product other than apples, though many
other fruits are the subject of state grading systems»
Third, Stata grades may continue to be used on open
containers of apples, though Washington apples, by virtu© of
their storage and the distance from which they come, are all
shipped to North Carolina in closed containers»
But, Mr» Justice. Stewart, w© have made a misstatement
on pagas 16 and 17 of our brief, in stating that all North
Carolina apples are sold in ©p©n containers»
QUESTION: Some are and some aren't»
MR» GORTON: Some are and some aren't»

27
And fourth * State grades may not be used on closed
containers of apples in North Carolina even though the U.S.
grade is also shown.
Thus* all Washington apples sold in North Carolina
will be graded.

Other apples may not be graded at all.

The North Carolina statute has substantially disrupted the
Washington apple business.

For some time most Washington

apple containers have been preprinted* with a prominent dis­
play of grade in order to facilitate not only their handling
-and storage* but their sale as wall.
Now* Washington producers have four choices* all
unpleasant.
First* a manual obliteration of the Washington grade
from each containers* which might possibly be shipped to North
Carolina? a mutilation which detracts from its appearance and
raises questions about the quality of the contents to all who
see it.

And this at a cost of between 5 and 15 cento a boss,

or as much as $72*000 a year for boxes bound to North Carolina
alone.
Now* while the North Carolina trade takes only on®
percent of the Washington apple crop* that involves some
$2 million worth of apples* and our shippers simply cannot
determine in advance which one percent will eventually go to
thafc State
So their second alternative is to . eliminate pre-

20

printed boxes entirely and hand-stamp manually the grade on
each box as it is xsfcilissed, at an obvious increase in cost.
Thirdly, of course, they can abandon the North
Carolina market? or, fourth, they can abandon an historic
grading system and —

QUESTION:

You stop printing on© percent

of the number you print.
HR. GORTONs The problem with that, Mr. Justice
Marshall, is that we don't know which one percent are going to
go to North Carolina, even at fch© time at which they're
shipped. Whan we have sold, say, to the Safeway chain in its
headquarters her© in Washington, D. C., which covers North
Carolina and a number of other States as well, or when w©
ship to an apple broker in Augusta, Georgia, who has customers
*

in several States.
QUESTION:
figura?

Well, where did you get the on© percent

Your on© percent is a firm figure.
MR. GORTON: The one percent is a firm figure, butt

we cannot da tormina which on© percent of our apples will go to
the Stat© of North Carolina.
Wa can, of course, as North Carolina i^ould like* us
to do, abandon this historic grading system, which has wide
trade acceptance.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, the —
I don’t think North Carolina wants you to

"**" is North Carolina interested in what you ship to New York?
Of course not.
MR. GORTONs They seem to be, and they may affect us
by this case.

In any event, toe affidavits which are found in

th© Appendix to this case, which talk of confusion, are all

31
from people

in the apple growing or selling business in North

Carolina, who do not deal in out-of”State apples at all.
All of the evidence in the record from those who do deal in
out-of-State apples, even in North Carolina, want to be able
to use, and they have, the Washington State grade.
So the effect of this system has been added costs to
Washington sellers and to North Carolina consumers, because of
this cost, some refusals by Washington apple producers to sell
to North Carolina buyers, and some refusals — and this is in
the record and undisputed -» by North Carolina purchasers to
purchase Washington apples.
The Commission itself has been frustrated in its duty
to ©rillanas the market for Washington apples and in an
advertising program which, sine© it obviously cannot emphasize
price, needs to speak to the quality of the apples concerned.
But th© North Carolina consumer, who must pay more,
receives less, because a practical Washington packer who
cannot us© the higher State grade is likely to ship apples to
North Carolina which mast only the U.S. grade.
Th© North Carolina wholesaler or retailer who wants
the highest grada of Washington apples is now denied this
grade information, at least as a representation on ’th® contain©!'
in which the apples are received, and it makes it more
difficult for him to get what, h© wants.
The only economic group which gains is the North

32
Carolina grower who spawned the statute in the first place#
and. ha gains by lessening his competition.
and this Court has consistently ruled that while a
State may regulate commerce to protect the health or safety
or its citizens from fraud# even though there may be some
effect an interestate commerce, it has a lack of power to
retard the burden or restrict the flow of commerce simply for
the economic advantage of the people within the State.
The Court has been particularly careful in scrutil­
izing restrictions placed on imported food products# which
competa with these produced locally# invalidating a whole
series of such restrictions on commerce in meats and milk
cases.

It permite State restrictions on interstate commerce

only when the State’s interest in its citizens’ health or
safety or the prevention of fraud or deception outweighs the
adverse effect on commerce.
It will permit a producing State to enhance the
reputation and quality of its agricultural producte# but not
where commerce is seriously burdened# simply to increase local
employment or only incidentally to benefit its reputation.
Here wa have a regulation which costs consumers
money# deprives wholesalers and retailers of desired informa™
tion# and all of the people in the business whose testimony
is in this record indicate that# .and works to the detriment of
out™ of•“State businesses as well as businesses .in North

33
Carolina who deal in apples at wholesale, or retail.
The regulation is unique as well as dubious, and,it
seems to us, falls within several of your prohibitions, perhaps
most particularly Bibb vs. Navajo Freight Lines.
And a final and added vice to the North Carolina
scheme is that it establishes no standard for apples at all;
it simply prevents the use of someone else*s standards.
Now, North Carolina asserts that the Commission lacks
standing to challenge its statuta, either on its own behalf
or as a representative of Washington apple

producers.

You’ve most clearly set these requirements out in
Warth v. Saldin and, just a month ago, in Boston Stock Exchange
vs. State TaK Commission, as follows;

And association may

have standing in its own right to seek judicial relief from
injury to itself and to vindicate whatever rights and immunities!
the association itself may enjoy.
Even in the absence of injury to itself, an
association may have standing solely as the representative of
its members.

The association must allege that its members or

any one of them are suffering immediate or threatened injury
as. a result of the challenged action of the sort that 'would
malt® out a justiciable css© had the members themselves brought
suit.
But, even apart from that, whether an association
has standing to invoke the Court’s remedial powers on behalf

34
of its members, depends in substantial measure on the nature
of the relief sought.

Xf, in a proper case, the association

seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of
prospective relief — which is exactly what we sought — it
can reasonably b© supposed that the remedy, if granted, will
inure to the benefit of those members of the association
actually injured.
Now, the Commission in/

the State of Washington

was created to engage in research for the use and improvement
of apples, to advertise for those apples, to ©ducat© the
public about its grades, and to stabilize and protect the
apple industry of the State of Washington, and to expand its
markets.

MR. GORTON:

They ara associate together by law,

and the fact that they are mandated to engage in such an
association makes them no different than the analogy which
you made earlier of membership in a labor union, which has a
closed-shop agreement with a particular employer.

That

membership is mandated, of course, as a condition of having a
job, just as here, in order to grow or to ship apples in
the State of — to produce apples commercially in the State

All taxpayers or

all citizens are at least so associated.
It seems to me* however, that the thrust of your
concern with the right of an association to sue for its
members is based not. on whether that association is created by
statute or created voluntarily, not, whether or not its
membership is fre© to join or not to join, but by whether or
not the representative will in fact properly represent the
interest of its members.
Whether or not a judgment entered on behalf of or
against the so-called association will bind or will affect,
if the judgment is what they seek, will affect affirmatively
the members of th© association.

Generally, th© real problem that one

grower would not have $10,000 jurisdiction.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

That may be the —
I think that*s the real problem.
I simply can’t answer that.

I suspect

that while we have many growers, there are almost 6,000 growers
in the State, we have only some 120 packers and shippers, and
it’s very, very possible that a given packer or shipper might
have that amount involved in the sales to th© state of North
Carolina, when you reflect that there are $2 million worth
shipped there.
QUESTION:

Did you show any by affidavits?

47
MR. GORTON;

No, that is not

there is nothing

in th© record to indicate that.
You're right# -though, as to growers, Mr. Justice
Marshall,' probably we would have that amount as to a shipper.

In summary, it s earns, both from your questions and
from the argument of opposing counsel, there is Xifctla question
her© as to th© interference in commerce of the particular
proposal, of the particular statute which the State of North
Carolina has passed.

It quite obviously falls within the

consistent ban this Court has placed on in™State producers
affecting commerce simply for -the benefit of those producers,
even though they set forth some kind of guise of th® protection
of the consumar or the health and safety of the people of the
State.
The problem of standing can be resolved either by
treating the Washington State Apple Advertising Commission
itself as the sol® party in an unrepresentative nature in the
State, but permitting it to deal with the Xoss©s to the business
in which it is solely engaged, or by reason of its own
advertising budget in th© State of North Carolina.
Alternatively, it can be treated appropriately as an
association, sine© th© decision her© would affect all of the
growers and all of th© shippers in the State of Washington.
