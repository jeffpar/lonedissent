PRO CE E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 75-651, Teamsters Union against Rodriguez, and the
related cases.
Mr. Hotvedt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. HOTVEDT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 75-718
MR. HOWEDTs

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court;
We speak for East Texas Motor Freight, which was
charged with violating the Civil Rights Acts for refusing
to transfer three Mexican-Anericans from city driving jobs
they held in San Antonio to road jobs in some other city.
Plaintiffs originally sought class relief as well.
But, as we shall discuss later, the trial and record really
developed as a suit by three individuals.

The defendants were

acquitted, securing a dismissal after trial, of all charges.
The Fifth Circuit reversed, deciding that it could
determine from its level -that the matter warranted class
treatment.

It set the classes and remanded for remedies.

I should say it. found liability to them as well, and remanded for
remedies.
We seek reversal of that Fifth Circuit decision,
restoration of the district court judgment or at least a remand
for a proper class determination by tee district court.

5

In the event the district court should certify a
class for some trial on liability, we seek guidance on the use
of racial statistics as an evidentiary device»
A brief statement of our special facts is in order
because of the regrettable tendency of the appellate court to
treat all Title VII and trucking industry cases alike.

We

think we have unique facts in this ceisef which we should like
to tally not. only to secure justice for ourselves but also to
put some rational bounds on the generalizations that have corn©
to dominate Title VII litigation.
The company i3 a common carrier., with many terminals
stretching across the country.

At soma of those terminals it

has both city drivers and road drivers.

At other terminals it

only has city jobs available.
Mr. Rodrigues, Mr. Herrera and Mr. Perez were city
drivers in San Antonio, who applied fox* transfer to a. road job
in 1970.

When their applications were not considered, they

attacked the transfer denial as a violation, arguing that the
company's localized hiring practice and rule against city-to­
ro ad transfer, as well as the contract seniority system, were
facially neutral policies that locked them in to lesser jobs.
QUESTION;
MR. IIQTVEDT;

Now, did San Antonio have road drivers?
It did not, Your Honor.

There is

evidence that, upon the acquisition of a predecessor company,
that company had one driver domiciled at that point because of

6

the way its sys ten

But that ceased to be the practice

,

and that was unexceptional in this record

as far as all

parties were concerned.
QUESTION: What was the nearest terminal that had
over-the-road drivers?
MR. HOTVRDT:

I think it was about 2 40 miles away,

elsewhere in Texas; but I’ra at a loss to know in which direction.
I think it was to the north, up towards Dallas.
The key fact here is that when plaintiffs originally
applied for jobs, they did so in a place where there were no
road jobs. They asked for and got the only job that the company
had to offer in San Antonio. And we think that these facts
distinguish this case from Franks v. Bowman and the similar
seniority cases with which this Court is familiar.
Plaintiffs complained of Civil Rights violations
as to themselves and a class of flexi can-Americans and blacks.
All defendants opposed the claim for class relief, in their
answers „
QUESTIONs There was no claim of any discrimination
in their original hiring.

Well, if you’re right, that -these

were — that they were hired on their first application, there
couldn’t have been.
MR. HOTVEDT:

Not only that, Your Honor, but at the

trial plaintiffs stipulated that they had not been discriminated
against when they were hired at San Antonio.

Plaintiffs did not move for a class certi ficati, on.
No court-managed pretrial conference occurred.
On the morning of the trial, th© parties reached
case-narrowing stipulations, th© most important of which was,
and I

quote, 13the only issue presently before the court

pertaining to tee company is 'V?hether its failure to consider
plaintiffs3 applications violated Title VII and Section 19 81.3'
So the trial went on»

The ruling rejecting any class ’

status came in the post-trial findings„

During trial, a

colloquy among court and counsel showed opposition to and doubt
about whether this was being tried as a class action»
In the Fifth Circuit, the district court's findings
of nondiscrimination as to the named plaintiffs and lack of
personal qualifications were reversed»

We ask'

for restoration

of Judge Wood's judgment, to be sure.
QUESTION:

Let m® ask you a question, if 1 may, Mr»

Hotvedfc, about th® class action aspect of the case in the
district court.
The plaintiffs did, in their complaint, ask for class
certification, did they not?
MR. IIOTVEDT;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Is it your position here, not only that

there should have been no class certification on th© merits but
that they ware under some sort of obligation to file a separate
motion during the trial?

0

MR, HOTVEDTs

We emphasise the second point, Your

Honor. That is,, that —* and it is pr@ci.3ely the first point of
argument we have here.

The fundamental error of the Fifth

Circuit, in ou.r opinion, was its disbelief that the plaintiffs
had abandoned or waived the class action aspects of it.
QUESTION: Well now, those are two separate points, I
would think.

One is, after you requested a class certification

in your complaint, to simply omit filing a motion prior to
trial.

I think that would stand on quite a different footing

than if in a stipulation in open court you say, We no longer
seek class certification.
MR. HOTVEDT: Well, Your Honor, it’s our view that
the burden for moving under Rule 23 to clear up the confusion
in cases of tills kind should very well be placed upon the
plaintiffs, whose responsibility it is to fulfill the internal
elements of the rule as well.
We point out that in tills record we had the
cumulative development of no movement for class certification
by the plaintiffs.,

the stipulation I have referred to, and

then the form of a trial which concentrated upon the individual
issues,

And we think -that for these reasons the reasoning of

tiie district court judge was correct.

And mors important, from

our standpoint, we had reason to rely upon it being tried as
an individual action. And w© think it was error for the Court
of Appeals to disbelieve that it was tried as an individual

9

action.
QUESTIONS

But you still — I understood from your

original statement/ the Court of Appeals could have said that
"We will remand it for consideration"?
MR. HOTVEDT:

Indeed.

Even if —

QUESTION: And they would have — they didn’t argu© it
in the Court of Appeals?
MR. HOTVEDT: We did not/ and it’s interesting to not®
that even the plaintiffs# when they approached the briefing to
the Court of Appeals, said# and I quote., "The class action
question has never been considered by tie lower court."
When the Court of Appeals earn® to the determination
that the plaintiffs had not abandoned the class issue# looking
at the state of confusion in the colloquy in the record# and
the different views on this point, the wise thing to do# 'the
correct thing to do would have been to remand for a fresh
determination on that point.

In fact# for the first determina­

tion on that point.
QUESTION:

But you don’t — I mean# you’re not

limited to that. The Court of Appeals could have said that it
is over.
MR. HOTVEDT:

Well# as I — for 'tii© reasons I

answered to Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

In What respect would you have tried the

10
case differently had you not relied on the stipulation?
MR. HOTVEDT:

If we had been assaulted frontally

with a pattern and practice type of case, or with a broad class
type of case, one brings to bear the kind of statistical and
expert evidence, it goes to the depth and breadth of one's trial
preparation, and the extent to which one goes .in handling the
argument, Your Honor.
But my point is not that this record is ready to
demonstrata we could have satisfied such a case, my point is
we deserved a fresh chance to counter such an approach.
One of the points that the Fifth Circuit ma.de in
saying that it’s of little mind that Rule 23 is being decided
at tills level rather than at the district court level, was that
on© should take a liberal approach to the interpretation of
Title VII, or Rule 23 fjfl . Title VII cases.
That expression about liberality in 'the interpretation
of Rule 23 is all right as far as it-gees,' but I think it arose,
at first, in the context of Title VII when defendant employers
in th© early Sixties or mid-Sixties were saying "no classes
should arise in Title VII cases."

And so the dictum arose

that these are inherent class cases, or this relief is
inherently class relief.
But that's what it is,by generalization or a dictum.
What we are faced with today, arising from at least
this Court of Appeals, is the notion that Rule 23 in Title VII

11
cases contains within, it soma mandat© for automatic results
in favor of the plaintiffs on the class issue.

And that*s

the extreme we call into question.
We think it was also especially erroneous for the
Court of Appeals to have set the classes at its level rather
than remanding to the district court.

In the light of what it

%

then knew to be the fact, the development of a major consent
decree reached following a 707 action brought by the Justice
Department against our client, East Texas Motor Freight; and
before the case was argued to the Fifth Circuit, before it
decided it, it knew that massive relief had been granted;
monetary, seniority, alteration of qualification rules, et
cetera.
It arrived on the seen© at the time 'the Court of
Appeals was in a position to look at the issues extant in the
Rodriguez case? and offer yet another reason against the
background of the confusion I referred to earlier.

For the

Court of Appeals to have sent it back to where it belonged
for the proper determination of a class issue, for the informed
judgment of a district court, in developing a. record on that
point.
QUESTION:

Then what would you do after the Court

made the determination of the class, would you. -then move to
re-open and offer some additional proof?
MR. HOTVEDT: We certainly would, but it would much

12
depend on

the shape of the class* Your Honor.
For example, the consent decree has overlapping

reaches down into the group that arises in San Antonio.

We

may very well have arguments that the class should be so
narrowed to one terminal or just a few terminals or to just a
limited number of persons in the light of what justice was
secured under the auspices of Judge Sarah Hughes in Dallas, when
we reached the consent decree.
We would further find that in its application
internally of Rule 23, the Fifth Circuit erred by its somewhat
cavalier approach to haw you go about satisfying the internal
elements.
I won’t dwell on that.
extensively.

We have briefed it

We would simply state that we think it unfair for

the Court of Appeals to say that there is no serious challenge,
that the internal elements of Rule 23(a) have bean satisfied.
That hasn’t even been focused yet.

We think that

plaintiffs, even in a Title VII case, should be put to the test
of thos rules.

And if we get a class action determination,

we’re prepared to challenge commonality, typicality? indeed,
adequacy of representation has not been aired.
And it’s interesting that we have here, for example,
the implications of severe questions about commonality and
typicality and adequacy of representation arising from within
facts where you have people of different kinds of ethnic

13
discrimination being claimed, with M@xican*"Am< tricans borrowing
statistics from blacks, with people from San Antonio,with no
road jobs, being represented by counsel with aspirations to
speak for people at domicile terminals.
The implications of ncsed for such an airing of those
issues are pretty clear, we think, on the remand.
We turn now to the proof of liability issue.
We think that the Court of Appeals erred in estab­
lishing -the components of a prima faci® case in class actions
under Title VII by the sweeping assumption that statistical
differences between work fores and population, standing alone,
are sufficient to make a prima, facie case.
Preliminarily here, we would note the government
position, which arrives in recent weeks, and we note that it
urges a remand for a new trial on the issue of liability,
saying that the Fifth Circuit erred by determining liability
to a class; and they concede that -this could have keen
premature and prejudicial to the defendant employer, with no
fair chance to contest liability on a class scale.
That's a welcome concession.

We think it carries

within it the logical implication that we were similarly
disadvantaged on the class issue, but we are prepaxed to receive
it on any terras,
As to proof of discrimination based on statistics
alone, or at least sufficient to shift the burden cf proof, we

14
recognize that proof of discrimination seldom -comes in. quotable
form.

On© has to search, for circumstantial evidences

expressions, remarks, conduct, inconsistent behavior and,
indeed, statistics.
So what we are seeing now is the statement that a
raw numerical disparity over a. broad geographical area between
population statisti.cs and the employer's work force constitutes
that element of proof which will shift the burden from the
plaintiff to the defendant and, in a court such as the Fifth
Circuit, put the employer in a hole from which ifc is very
difficult to extricate himself.
We think it especially ironic that this reliance on
such undifferentiated statistics should arise tinder a statute
which contains the congressional caution of Section 70 3(j).
We; r© not suggesting -that that section prohibits the use of
statistics at all, but when the Congress goes to the trouble
of suggesting that one should not create special favor for a
particular ethnic or racial type because of th© statistical
imbalance, on© thinks then that the development of evidentiary
rules under th© statute should vary well take place in a
careful manner.
And we ask, what is the logical reach of — or what
is th© inference to be drawn from a statistical imbalance on a
broad scale?
QUESTION:

Is 703(j) reprinted her® somewhere?

15
MR. HOTVEDT:

In. the Joint Appendix, Your Honor,

on the penultimate and final page.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HOTVEDT: VI® have this case arising from within
San Antonio, Texas, where we have three individual plaintiffs,
Mexican-Americans, who would borrow, for purpose of burden
shifting proof, black and Mexican--American statistics from
the system at places where those jobs existed.
But what logical inference is there, particularly
in the context of their earlier stipulation, that they had
not been discriminated against at the time of hire.- that these
people suffered hiring discrimination?
We say none.
>

We think it's time for the development within the

plaintiffs' case of a requirement for congruity between -the
statis-tics they us® and the available labor market and skills
and ages of the workers, and whether these people, as
plaintiffs and as members of plaintiff class, were reasonably
within the zone of those who could have been impacted by the
adverse hiring decision.
Messrs. Rodrigues, Herrera and Perez, and similar
city drivers like themselves at San Antonio, or at other
terminals that were not places where one domiciled drivers,
certainly not on this record is there any basis for concluding
that they were reasonably

witAin that zone.

16

QUESTION:

Where was the closest terminal -that

domiciled drivers, over-the-road drivers?
MR, IIGTVEDT:

About 240 miles away, Your Honor,

And I would point out that the Fifth Circuit,
somehow sensing in the latter stages -of its opinion that the
©lament of discrimination in hire is somehow an element of
the guidance it secured from this Court earlier, tried to
supply that on a bar© record by presuming labor mobility in
South or West Texas for Mexican-Americans with a reference to
its own out-of-context, or different context, development
in the Johnson v, Goodyear case.
And that’s all ther© is for th© Fifth Circuit
making up, at the appellata lev©!, arguments, proofs, evidence,
et cetera, on labor mobility which might supply the element
of discrimination in hire for these people.
My time has expired,

I have reserved four minutes

for rebuttal.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Penshom.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD W. PENSHORN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 75-651
MR. PENSIIORNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
In the Rodrigues case, the individual plaints.ffs
named not only their employer, East Texas, as a defendant, but

17
joined the Southern Conference of Teamsters arid it's their
own Local Union 657, which is located in San Antonio.
The trial court held that Local 657 had not violated
either Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or Section 1981 with
respect to these three individual members of that Local.
The Fifth Circuit reversed as to the unions, and
specifically 657, with this language:

For their role in

establishing separate seniority rosters, it failed to make
allowance for minority city drivers, who have been dis crimin­
atori ly relegated to city driver jobs,
I understand that language to mean that Local 657
has been held by the . Fifth Circuit to have violated both
Section 1981 of Title 42, and Title VII, for failing to
establish some type of contractual right to transfer with what
is commonly called company seniority.
With that in mind, I would like to call the Court9s
attention to some of the pertinent, facts that I believe ar©
relevant to -the position of Local 657 with regard to remedying
or doing what the honorable Fifth Circuit said it should have
don© .
QUESTION s

Mr. Pens horn, will you first give me the

jurisdiction of the Local?
MR. PENSHORN:

Yes, sir.

The jurisdiction, the

geographical jurisdiction, Your Honor, of Local 657 is bounded
on th© south by the Mexican border, it runs north approximately

18
250 rallos to Austin, Texas, and west some distance, oh, 'I
would say approximately 200 miles.
Does that answer Your Honor's question?
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Does that include the city

drivers and the road drivers?
MR, PENSHORN:

As Mr. Hotvedt pointed out, Local

657 has no representation jurisdiction of any road drivers
employed by East Texas,. . because none are domiciled within
the jurisdiction of this particular Local Union.
Doas that answer your questi.on?
QUESTION s

That means -that whole area?

MR. PENSHORN: That whole area.

There were none

within that area.
QUESTION: So the employees you represented were all
city drivers or other city employees?
MR. PENSHORN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

Unh-hunh.

MR. PENSHORN:

That is exactly correct.

And another very important fact about this particular
Local Union is that it is and always has been an integrated
Local Union.
QUESTION:

One other thing:

who represents the line

drivers in that same geographic area?
MR. PENSHORN;
•they are domiciled.

It depends, Your Honor, upon where

If they were domiciled in San Angelo,

19
which is within, another Local’s jurisdiction, that Local
would.

The Dallas Local, which had some, I believe, at the

relevant time», vauld be represented by that Local Union, in
Dallas.
QUESTION?

I s@@,

MRo PENSHORN:
QUESTION?

But there were —

Non© is domiciled within your geographical

jurisdiction, —
MR. PENSHORN?
QUESTION?

No, sir.

““ some drive through it, and the Local

to which -they belong would depend upon where they ara
domiciled?
MR. PENSHORN? Exactly, Your Honor.
Local 65? put. into evidence in this record a
statistical summary of the racial breakdown of all the
employees of East Texas Motor Freight for the period from
1952 to, I believe, 1971.

And if my memory serves me correct,

that statistical summary showed that Mexican-Amaricans and
Negro employees were in the majority in tha employment of
East Texas within this jurisdiction from the period 1952 until
1972.
In further anticipation of what we thought would be
the plaintiffs1 attempts to show some specific conduct by
Local 657, amounting to violation of these two statutes, we
also compiled, and there is in this record, a statistical

20

breakdown of the general membership of Local 657, which
reflects that since 1365 the majority of the general member­
ship have been Maxican-Americans and Negroes,
A third statistical summary that was introduced by
Local 657 pertained to the racial composition of this
particular bargaining unit, and by that I mean the bargaining
unit consisting and covered by the National Master Freight
Agreement and the Southern Conference Supplement,
That statistical summary also showed that sine©
1965 the majority of the employees within the jurisdiction,
representation jurisdiction of Local 657, working for this
employer, were also Mexican-Americans and Negroes,

Certainly

negating any contention that within the jurisdiction of
Local 657 there was any hiring discrimination by this employer
with which this Local defendant could have participated,
Nov/ then, in the briefs before the Court, we call
th® Court's attention to the bargaining procedures which are
followed in the negotiation of the National Master Freight
Agra@mon.fc and also the Southern Conference Supplement, -to
which Local 657 is a party by reason of having given powers of
attorney to national and regional negotiating committees,
Thera is also evidence in this record that at no
time, from th© period of 1952 to the date of th© trial, had
any member of this Local Union ever complained in a meeting
called for the purpose of presenting contractual demands to the

21

employer that, ther© was racial discrimination in these
contracts„
There is also evidence in this record that at no
time, sine© 1952, had any minority member of this Union, in
th© proper meetings called for the purpose of obtaining
contractual demands, ever made a complaint that these contracts,
locked them in, and that that so-called lock-in was racially
dis criminatory ■>
QUESTIONS

You5re not suggesting that the absence of

such statements in a union meeting would be dispositive of
this claim, are you?
MR» PENSKORN:

No, sir.

I'm saying, Your Honor, that

— basically what I am saying is that my position is that th©
plaintiffs in this cas© must prove more, they must prove son©
conduct by Local 657, other than the mere existence of separate
contracts for road and city drivers, to hold this Local Union
liable.
That is my position. Do©s that answer your question,
Your Honor?
I think -that there is also a stipulation in this
record that in so far as Local 657 is concerned, that no white
city driver has ever transferred from

&

city driver's job

within the jurisdiction of Local 657 to a road driver's job
and carried with him his company seniority, for any purpose.
In fact, if my memory serves me right, I don't recall

22
there being any evidence of a city driver transferring to a
road job.
The Court has long ago recognised that national
bargaining units are recommended and promoted by Congress* by
reason of the National Labor Relations Act.

Andy as I have

already stated* Local 657 entered into this contract and was
— into this negotiating unit, and was bound by its decision
as a bargaining unit.
Thank you* Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well* Mr. Penshorn.

Mr. Baab.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. WILLIAM BAAB* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 75-715
MR. BAAB;

Mr. Chief Justice* may it pleas® the

Court s
First of all* I would like to point out* as the
Court may be aware* there is an important factual distinction
between this case and the one that preceded it.

That is *

the employer's absolute no transfer rule at the San Antonio
Terminal* which absolutely prohibited the possibility of city
»

drivers transferring to road jobs under any circumstances.
As we pointed out in our brief herein* accordingly*
where there can be no transfer* seniority rules which operate
only on transfer in 'fact never operate.

Bo* indeed* at the

San. Antonio Terminal they had no causal, effect and are not an

23
active consideration in regard to alleged violation of Title
VII.
QUESTION: Well, the company had a no transfer rule at
every terminal, didn't it?
MR. BAAJB;

It lifted it3 no transfer rule, as I

underatend it, at road domicile terminals for a short period
of time in 1972.
QUESTION s

Y@S.

MR. BAABs

I would like, although it has been

discussed in the preceding case, again briefly to address the
issue of union liability concerning these seniority rules,
which are the same, of course, as those in T.I.M.E;-DC.
Initially I would like to say that Mr. .Justice
White, I think, is correct in his questions about fch© position
of the union as a Rule 19 defendant.

We think that would bo

our proper position in these cases.
That is so because we regard cur seniority systems
as bona fid®, not having their genesis in racial discriminal
felon, and because we would then be present for the accordance
of relief.
But I do want to state that we regard this Court’s
opinion in Franks as being very clear that, inasmuch as our
systems are bona fide, they do net and cannot be read to bar
rightful place relief.
And in clarification of what was said to and by Mr,

24

Wells, I am authorized to state that this union supported it
at the time of this trial in this case, in Rodrigues, and
T.I.MpEo^DC, and before that and since, the proposition of
rightful place relief in these kinds of cases»
QUESTION : What do you understand to be the predicate
for the Court of Appeals holding that the union violated cue
Act here?
MR» 3AABi Well, without quoting it precisely, it
states that because the seniority rules do not automatically
grant to those who are alleged to be discriminatees full
carryover seniority, w®,.quote, "lock them in", close quote,
arid that, under the Quarles line of cases, violates Title VII»
QUESTION:

But nobody is ever going to transfer,

except for — if the company discriminates.
MR. BAAB:

But that is the point, that’s the

company's discrimination, if that happens.

And that’s what

ought to b® addressed,
Tha question of the seniority rules and their
applicability is one of relief,
QUESTION:

But there's no special — that's all there

was in this ease, also, that there's no finding that the
seniority system itself was discriminatory.
MR, BAAB*

And there could be none.

Everybody

admits it's neutral both in its origin and on its face.
Really, th© whole lock-in theory, at least as it

25

applies to these cases, is one of relief.
QUESTION;

Then, I want to b© sure that I understand

you to have mad© by way of a concession when you began, you
concede that you could have been in here as a so-called Rule
19 defendant»
MR. BAAB z
QUESTION;

Yea.

Yes', we do.

For the purpose of according adaquat®

relief to the plaintiffs.
MR. BAAB;

Adequate relief based on, if found,

employer discrimination at hiring, that’s right.
QUESTION;

And assuming employer discrimination

were validly found, -~
MR. BAABs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
— what could you have, as a Rule 19

defendant, been ordered to do or not to do?
MR. BAAB;

To honor the court's award of rightful

place relief to those discriminated against.
QUESTION; What do you envision as rightful place
relief in this context?
t

MR. BAAB:

On a very general basis, as applied to

this case, job bidding and layoff and recall, seniority in
road jobs -that the discriminat©® would have had but for
discrimination against him.
Now, that involves consideration of various elements,
which would include either an application or a proven reason

26

why no application would ba made.
QUESTIO!1??

On a certain ~~ at a certain date or at

a oar tain time.
MR. SAAB:

Yes.

QUESTION: And then his seniority in the over-fch®road local would date from feat. time.
MR. SAAB *

From feat time.

What I would lik© to point out is -«•
QUESTION;

According to feat statement, on qualifi­

cation .
MR. BAAB:

Qualification and vacancy.

QUESTION:

Y@s„

QUESTION:

If he was qualified, there was a vacancy,

and h© did or showed feat he abolut&ly would have mad© an
application, had it not bean for racial discrimination.
MR. BAAB:

Yes.

QUESTION: But, of course, if the Court'happened to
disagree with you and say, well, there isn't such a tight
proof requirement, you would still say that you still would be
— you still would b© an object for fee remedy: I mean, you
would still have to comply with the —
MR. BAAB:
QUESTION:

Yes, we would.
Without a finding that you violated tfc©

Act.
MR. BAAB:

Yes. And we are bound by the rightful

27

place theory as the courts may define it.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn’t say that without any

violation of the Act having been properly found feat you could
b@ liable for back pay?
MR. BAAB:

Exactly not.

Well* even if on® ware found* concerning hiring or
transfer* we still think we’re not liable.
QUESTION: Well* I know* but the Court of Appeals —
didn’t the Court of Appeals say that fee district court was
going to have to work out some allocation of liability for
back pay -MR. BAAB:

Yes.

QUESTION:

— between the union and the company?

MR. BAAB:
was based on

They did say that.

But* of course* that

the Court of Appeals did say

QUESTION:

But none of your concession would go to

back pay?
MR. BAAB:

Only rightful place seniority relief*

which is our real purpose.
And* incidentally* there has been some discussion
about what unions could have done concerning relief* which is
— Mr. Justice Marshall had addressed feat.

This contract*

of course* awards road or city seniority upon entry into that
particular bargaining unit.
«

Of course* the contract in Franks awarded seniority

28
only upon daft© of employment for fthts individuals involved.
That contract was not consIdared to bar the rightful place
relief that this Court gave.
So with ours.

In fact;, quite 'the contrary.

If, but for discrimination, this individual

would have been in the road unit, there*s nothing in our
contract that would bar or undercut the award of rightful
place seniority.
Really, again, it's just a problem of relief.
But I want to point out, in ending, if I may, 'the
impossibility of the union's position in doing what
respondents here, and the government in other case, have
suggested that we must:

that is, without proof, without

determination of discrimination, unilaterally award1 to minority
city drivers, full carryover seniority in road jobs.
That is what respondents say they want here as
relief.

This case, as Mr. Hotvedt pointed out, was tried

primarily on an individual basis.
In proof, concerning the three named individuals,
the trial court found they had not properly applied for, had
not been qualified for, and had not been discriminatorily
denied road jobs.

There was no other evidence offered at

trial as to any other individual, No. 1, applying for or even
wanting a road job, as to any other individual in a class of
some 200 people, the class they want, the Texas-wide class,
even being qualified for a road job, end scant evidence as to

29

vacancy.
This Court recognised in McDonald vs. Santa F® Trni1 ,
that, indeed, a union's Titi® VII obligation extends to
members and representative employees of all races.

Were we

unilaterally to award road seniority to minority city people
under those circumstances., whites would absolutely have a
claim of

reverse discrimination against us.

We have to wait until either the individuals allege
discrimination and seek to us© th© grievance procedure to
f

prove it, to get'their rightful place that way, or go to
court, or if we can have a factual situation where, as we do
from time to time., work out an agreement and effect 'th© award
that way.
But the Solicitor General himself has agreed in his
brief in th© Jersey Central case that to prefer any minority
individual simply because of his membership in e, class, rather
than based on a showing of individual discrimination, would be
to effect

reverse discrimination. That's what is prohibited.
We don't want fc© effect reverse discrimination.

Nevertheless, w© strongly adhere to the proposition of rightful
place relief.
Thank you,
QUESTION:

Mr. Bsab, do you read th© Court of

Appeals opinion to find clearly erroneous th© district court's
disposition of those three individual cases that you mentioned?

30

MR. BAABs

They used the words ”clearly erroneous'’.

A careful reading of his reasons for doing sc, I think,
indicate that can’t b® supported.

But they do us© the words,

saying the finding is clearly erroneous.

But they really find

•that there was, as the employer said, discrimination in -the
air, that there appeared to be a pattern and practice of
discrimination, although not against any single identifiable
person.
Then, against that background, well, the findings
against the individuals must ha vs been erroneous, so go back
and see if they were»
QUESTION: And what if we agreed with you on the class
action matter, that the Court of Appeals should not have,
itself, designated the class.

I would think not, upon this record.

I

personally think the case was tried as an individual action,
no proof was offered concerning the class except that there
was a group of 200 minority city drivers#

There was shown

no adverse impact on any of them, by virtu© of the alleged
actions #
QUESTIONs

Well, you would say that the Court of

Appeals erred in the class designation, that we should then
reverse and reinstate the judgment of the district court?

no discrimination was clearly erroneous, as to the factual
findings on which that was based#

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. VILMA S. MARTINEZ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS RODRIGUES, ET AL.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a number of legal and factual

32

questions, some are technical complaints„
Petitioners strenuously argue these complicated
points and try to obscure th® basis nature of this case.
In approaching th© difficult question —
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Martin®zt may I

suggest that you lower the lectern, so that you will get, the
microphone — if you will lower it with the ■—
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Oh.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Then you will b© closer

to th© microphone.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

1 didn't know this was possible,

Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, it’s very flexible

here.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Is that batter?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, that's batter.

Thank you.

In approaching ‘these difficult questions, however,
I would urge the Court not to loss sight of two simple facts.
Th© first on© is that th® record shows that East
Texas Motor Freight is a blatantly discriminatory employer,
and that East Taxas Motor Freight is joined by the Union
Petitioners in seeking to perpetuate th® effect of feheir
traditional and nationwide commitment to employment discrimina­
tion

33

Petitioners’ arguments boil down feo a salvo of
complicated legal reasons for denying to their Mexican-American
and black employees and members what this Court sai.d in
Albemarle Paper Company and Franks v. Bowman was due -them?
Complete relief from Petitioners' employment discrimination.
In my argument I wish to focus on three of the
reasons advanced by Petitioners;

one, feat this was not a

proper class action? second, that we did not prove a prima
faci® class — case? and, third, that the no transfer rul®
on seniority system of petitioners did not violata the law.
Because the Petitioners have understated the extent
of employment discrimination shown on the record, I would
briefly highlight that evidence.
East Texas Motor Freight had never employed a
Mexican-American or a black road driver in the Southern
Conference in Taxas until Mr. Rodriguez filed his EEOC charge
in 1970.
East Texas stipulated in tha government suit that
as late as to 1972 the company had no black road drivers any­
where, and only eight Mexican-Arnerican road drivers among its
approximately 180 road driver work force.
QUESTION s

Nov/, when you're speaking of this, are

i

you speaking of Local 657 hers?
MRS. MARTINS2:

I am speaking of the Southern

34

QUESTION*

Of the whole Conference?

MRS. MARTINSZ;
QUESTIONS

Y®S.

Wall, Local —

MRSo MARTINEZ;

Only as it relates to the State of

Texas , we sought, a class that would cover the employees In —
in fact, we sought a class covering applicants and employees
in th© State of Texas»

Th© class was narrowed by the Fifth

Circuit to city driver, black and Mexican-American city
drivers»
QUESTION; Well, that makes quite a lot of difference
in light of the argument you were just embarking on, does it
not?
MRS, MARTINEZ;
QUESTION;

Well, I think the statistics

How is it relevant what some ether local

or some other are® did or did not do, by way of employing
minorities?

You’ve lost me on that point.

MRSo MARTINEZ:

I’m sorry-.

I think the statistic

is very relevant, because we5 re talking about the same company.
East Texas Motor Freight, and its employment pattern in the
State of Texas.
We are also talking about the union defendants, and
we have her© two union defendants, the Southern Conference and
all of its members within the State of Texas, and also the
Local Union which our three named plaintiffs were a member of.
I wanted to point out that of th® eight Mexican-

35
American read drivers that East Tex as Motor Freight had in
1972, it had, itself, hired only three of them. The rest it
had acquired through a merger.

The tarminal-by-terminal,

Statewide and Southern Conference employment figures make it
crystal clear that race was a constant and pervasive factor
in staffing ETHP truck driver jobs.
In El Paso, for example, all city drivers were
minorities, but road driver jobs were reserved for whites.
In Port Worth, with no road drivers domiciled, all
35 city drivers were Anglo.
In Pecos, with no city drivers, all 16 road drivers
were Anglo.
And superimposed on these statistics ware two
policies which operafcad to lock in all of the minority citydrivers into the city position. These war®, of course, ETMF's
no transfer rule, which prohibited transfer from city to road
positions, and further which prohibited transfer between
terminals.
QUESTION:

But -that’s a company rule?

MRS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, it’s a company rule. Your

Honor,
QUESTION:

The union had no part in that rule.

MRS. MARTINEZ:

They did not.

However, their role cams in through the collective —

two points now, is that right?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Yes.

MRSo MARTINEZ;

But the point is that the other one

is the Petitioner's seniority system.

Under the union

contract
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

On this, is it true that

these three named parties ar© in San Antonio, and in San
Antonio it’s impossible to transfer from city to road?
MRS, MARTINEZ:

That is precisely the thrust or

our complaint,
QUESTION; For anybody.
QUESTION:

And now, why is that discriminatory?

On the basis of race, color, or national origin.
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

It says nobody,

MRS. MARTINEZ:

Because, Your Honor, in —

Pardon me?

It says nobody,

MRS. MARTINEZ:

Yes, I understand that.

However, the impact of -that facially neutral rule is
on minorities,
QUESTION;

Why?

MRS. MARTINEZ;

Because whites could always get

the .road driver jobs at other terminals,
road driver jobs were held by white males.

In fact, all 180

MRS. MARTINEZ:

Not a on© —

QUESTION: Because idler® were no jobs.
MRS-,, MARTINEZ:

There were no jobs in Sein Antonio.

However, our -dire© named plaintiffs were willing to move.
They further war© willing, at an early point, to giv© up their
seniority to move.

But the system operated to lock them into

the city driver position in the San Antonio Terminal.
QUESTION:

Now,how was that?

How did it lock

them in?
MRS. MARTINEZ:
company said:

It loekad them in because Hie

You may not transfer between termineIs.

QUESTION: Well, I know, but that's the company,
not the union.
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

And then th® union said «—

That's not the collective bargaining

contract.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

And then the union said:

But if you

do transfer, you may not carry over your unit seniority which
you have earned only in 'the city driver unit.
Needless to say, that would b@ a substantial
impediment.
QUESTION:

But the "if” never came into operation.

If there were no transfers for anybody from city to over-Hi©”
road drivers, then the seniority provisions never had any

38

effect.

Do they?
MRS,MARTINEZ;

But in striking down, hopefully#

that --

QUESTION;

That would have had effect only if there

had been transfers# and there were no transfers in this
company.

Isn’t that correct?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Yes. And that rule was challenged#

and not only the no transfer rule but -the subsequent and
followup impact of til® now operative collective bargaining
agreement# if there is a successful cha.lle.ng© to the company’s
no transfer rule.
There is# furthermore# additional proof of discrimina*»
tion in this record.

Contrary to the assertions that East

Texas Motor Freight# that it applies equally its facially
neutral driving standards# ETMF has often treated its minority
and Anglo employees differently by not requiring all Anglo
drivers to meet those standards.

QUESTION:

They know them when they see them.

MRS. MARTINEZ:

In analyzing the appliestion, -the

52 road drivers who were either employed as new road drivers
or transferred from the city to the road by East Texas Motor
Freight, between '70 and '72, 12 did not meet a stated
requirement for the road position which was a high school
diploma or its equivalency.

The names of these individuals

ar® found at page 181 of the Appendix.
Further, a high company official testified that East
Texas relies very heavily on referrals by incumbent employees

40

as a source of applicants.

The incumbents, of course, ar©

Anglo.
QUESTION:

While you ar© on that? how many Anglo

or Negro applications were denied?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

til© class of applicants? and that’s why the Fifth Circuit —*
QUESTION: Well? I thought that’s what the cas© was
all about? that people had applied and. been denied.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

No? it’s about the inability of

minority city drivers? existing employees? to transfer and

QUESTION: Well? what city amploy®© applied and was
not given a job?
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

Our three named plaintiffs.

Is that — did they apply?

MRS. MARTINEZ;

They applied.

They applied — they

MRS. MARTINEZ:

That has not yet b£-;en

QUESTION:

Generally a class is ~~ if I can think

out loud a minute ™- it consists of people who have a grievance
of some kind,, and people who never wanted to transfer, as Mr.
Justice Marshall said, weren't qualified, never thought of it,
never wanted to, would have no grievance whatsoever? would
they?
MRS, MARTINEZ:

Well, we haven't yet —

QUESTION: So hew could the class include all the city
employees, even those described by my brother Marshall?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Because certainly they «ere all

affected by the policies
QUESTION;

How?

How?

If they never had any idea of

wanting to transfer, how possibly were they affected by that
policy?
MRSo MARTINEZ:

It's hard, at this first-stage

proceeding, Your Honor, to identify those class members who
in fact wanted to transfer.
QUESTION;

But generally the definition of a class

43

is a group of people who have one thing la common, at least,
and that is that they have a common grievance of some kind»
MRS. MARTINEZt

Well, the common grievance here

certainly was the system involved here, the collective
bargaining agreement, the no transfer rule, and the statistics
which showed that road driving jobs weirs for Anglo males.
QUESTION:

No, but what if, as has been suggested —«

and I think you have not yet answered
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

And the no transfer — pardon m©»

— have not yet answered? what if these

people didn’t want to leave San Antonio, they like San Antonio,
they Ilk® city driving, because they could return to their
homes ©very night.

Are -they properly members of any class

of people with a grievance?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Well, as I have said to Mr. Justice

Marshall, certainly our three named plaintiffs indicated they
were willing to move, at an early stags in their application,
they were willing to giv® up their seniority? but it would be
very difficult, in this factual context, with the company having
a no transfer rule, to look for applications because of the
no transfer rule.
QUESTION: Well, then, ars you talking about these
three people being the class?
MRS0 MARTINEZ:

They ar© members of the class.

Thera

are, conceivably, other members in 'the class who were similarly

44
situated, and, in fact, there were other people who fc@3td.fied
at trial, Mr. Trinidad Gores2, for example, also said that he
had wanted to apply.
QUESTION*

How about those that just didn't want to

leave the Canal in San Antonio, or didn't want to leave the
Alamo?
[Laughter. ]
MRS. MARTINEZ*

In that case, they will, probably

not be coming forward at the remedy stage, where we will h©
attempting to identify those people who did in fact,' want to
transfer to these jobs.
QUESTION:

But by the tome you get to remedy, you

have passed liability, and you have found that the company —•
you hope to have proved at that stag® that fch© company has
violated the Act with respect tc ©very single member of the
class.
Now, that won't quit© be true, will it, if some of
fch© city drivers never wanted to transfer, and would get veryangry if somebody suggested that they would transfer.
MRS. MARTINEZs

Well, the answer could wall b@ that;

what wa would do then is to say the class will consist of
people who, in fact, wanted to transfer.
QUESTION: Well, now we’re getting down to —*
MRS. MARTINEZ?

Who wanted to transfer, even though

they might not have actually applied, because of these —

45
QUESTION:
the class?

But — so let's ask again: What is

Mr. Justice Marshall asked what your class was.

Now, have you changed?

Just the city drivers who want to

trans fer?
MRSo MARTINEZ:

Who wanted or now want to

transfer.
QUESTION: So that's the class?
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

May I ask a question, Mrs. Martin©z?

MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

That's our class.

Y©s .

With respect to the three named defendants,

in view of the findings of — named plaintiffs, I should have
said.

With respect to th© findings of the district court as

to their absence of qualifications,each of them had besn
engaged in, or involved in a number of accidents involving
injuries to people, is it still your position that they had
demonstrated their qualification for over™ th©»’road jobs?
MRS. MARTINEZ;

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

For two

reasons.
No. 1, as the Fifth Circuit pointed out, the same
standards -that have bs@n used to evaluate the qualifications
of Anglos were not used in evaluating the qualifications of
the named plaintiffs.
QUESTION: Does the record show that people, Anglos,
had been employed after having been engaged in as many

46
as three accidents involving seven injuries?
HRS. MARTINEZ:

X think the record is not complete

is not complete in that respect.

But certainly it does

show that th© same standards were not being used by the
company. And further, the record shows, that the company had
stipulated that it, itself, had never even considered th®
applications of th© individual plaintiffs.
And that, of course, is the meaning of that
stipulation that Mr. Hotvedt relies on, to say that we gave
up th© class action on the ©ve of trial.
That stipulation went to what was th© standard to b@
used by the court to determine if there had been discrimination
against the individual plaintiffs.
We contended that th© discrimination consisted of
not considering their applications.
Further, by a separata stipulation, th® company
stipulated:

It’s true, we have not considered their applica­

tions .
Th® record which th© company then came in with was
a record which they compiled after the charges, EEOC charges,
had bsen filed, and they used that record to says

Now, looking

it over, w@ contend they are not qualified.
QUESTIONs

Was the reason the company didn't consider

the applications because of its no transfer rule?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

W© contend that th© reason was

47
certainly -die no transfer

rule, but also the fact that road

driver jobs war© limited to Anglo males»
Again* in remembering what was ~~
QUESTION:

But they were also limi-feed to original

hire in over"the-road jobs* weren’t they?
MRS„ MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

In over-the--road jobs*

Given a no transfer rule»

MRS, MARTINEZ:

Precisely,

And of

course we were

hired here* our plaintiffs were* t© city jobs,
QUESTION:

You were hired in San Antonio for city

jobs* and that’s the only jobs that the company had in San
Antonio»
MRS o MARTINEZ:

But we were complaining about the

inability to go into the road jobs.
Again# understanding what was in this record* I
think it's important to see what sort of responses the
plaintiffs were getting when they indicated# very early# a
desire for the more lucrative and desirable road jobs.
To oral requests for transfer# the plaintiffs received non"
eommital responses from company and union officials that they
would look into it.

That the no transfer rule precluded such

a transfer.
One of them even said that road jobs war© not for
Mexican-Americans, that the equipment was too expensive for
Mexican-Amaricans to b© driving it.

48
When plaintiff Pores learned from East Texas Motor
Freight’s new terminal manager that there were road openings
in San Angelo, h® sought, the assis tarda of the union president
in getting that job.
The response of the union president was to go to the
manager’s superior and ask that superior to tell the new
manager to quit giving out this type of information.
And then the response to the filing of the EEOC charges
was to invite th® plaintiffs to file written applications,
which they themselves have stipulated they -then ignored* and
were not. even forwarded to th© Dallas office, who does th®
main hiring,
QUESTIONi

Mrs, Martinas, does th© record tell us

whether th,® three named plaintiffs would have taken over-the­
re ad jobs and given up their seniority?
MRS, MARTINET

Yes, it does.

And at luast on® of

them testified that he would have given up his seniority.
Another one, Mr, Herrera, testified that earlier, yes, h®
would have given up his seniority, but now that h® was older
he saw that as far mors of an impediment,
QUESTIONs

I should refine the question a little

bit. Does the record show whether- the named plaintiffs so
advised the company?

Or did they just ask for a transfer with

full seniority?
MRS, MARTINEZs

No, I think th© record is clear that

49

they did so advise the company officials and the union
officials as well.
QUESTION;

That they are willing to surrender

seniority if they could get the road jobs?
MRS. MARTINEZ;

And th© union officials as well.

Sine© the filing of the EEOC charges in the complaint
in this suit, ail three named plaintiffs h&v© been discharged.
At the time the complaint was filed, Mr. Rodrigues had worked
for East Texas Motor Freight six years, Mr. Perez for twelve,
Mr. Herrera for six.
.Again, I would like to argue that this was a proper
class action, and the Fifth Circuit so held.
There were, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out,
allegations in the complaint, in the pretrial order, in the
colloquy with plaintiffs* counsel at the trial.
Further, th® nature of the plaintiffs' claims
themselves bespeak a need for a class action look at the nature
of the discrimination being complained about.
QUESTION:

But, of course, that goes, Mrs. Martinez,

only -to th© fact that the plaintiffs preserved their right to
have the district court make the determination.

It doesn't go

further and say that the district court should have determined
it in their favor.
Would you not agree with that?
Those are th® factors you. just mentioned.

50
MRSo MARTINEZ:

Initially,, that argument? but, you

know, the record doesn't end there.

There is in fell® record,

substantial evidence which showed how these systems operate,
what the statistics were, what the experience of {he plaintiff?
were in trying to get the road driver jobs, et cetera. And we
contend that that, was sufficient to show that there was a
proper class action, which did comply with all of -die require­
ments of Rul© 23ia) and 23(b)(2).
QUESTION:

Mrs, Martinez, it occurs to me that

neither of the two issues that Judge Wisdom identifies at the
beginning of his opinion is really raised by -these plaintiffs,
because the first issue was to challenge the requirement that
they resign their jobs in order to get. a road driver job,
and you say they indicated they were willing -to do -that. So
that that rul© wasn’t an obstacle.
And the second was that 'they would lose seniority:
and you say they were willing to do that, too.

So these

people don’t raise the issues the court discusses.
Is that — what’s wrong with my understanding?
MRS, MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

Some were and som© were not willing.

of fehes© thrae, I’m talking about the

three named plaintiffs.
MRS. MARTINEZ:
QUESTION:

Of th© individual named plaintiffs,

oh, I see.

and others were not? is that it?

Some were willing to

resign

MRS. MARTINEZ:

That, is right.

QUESTION: Would you identify thorn, so I know which
they were., when I —
MRS. MARTINEZ:

I can't remember.

I think it was

Mr. Perea who had said that ha would be willing to resign?
Mr. Herrera indicated that he might have earlier, but now,
you know, it was too late, and ha needed the seniority that he
had as city driver in San Antonio.
QUESTION:

I thought you told me that they all three

had advised the company that they were willing to resign?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Initially.

You understand, they

had been making these applications orally in -the 1960’s, and
in writing
QUESTION:
tine application?

But the question:

just exactly what was

Was it "I want to transfer with seniority”

or "I’m willing to resign and take the new job if you’ll give
it to mer‘?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

The application, as I recall it# was

that they were willing to resign without seniority.
QUESTION:

If -that’s their case# -they don’t raise

this basic issue that Judge Wisdom spent so much time talking
about.
Maybe I missed something here, I don’t know.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

They mad© that offer, but the

company said to -them that they still couldn’t transfer# and

52
they did not accept their application,,

As I menticned earlier,

the company took these letters, which are set out «vt pages
324 through 326 of the Appendix, and basically filed them
away.
QUESTIONs

Well, it seems to m© you have a simple

case of out-and-out discrimination against three people,
rather than a class case involving these rules, if I understand
it correctly»
MRS0 MARTINEZ:

I think w© have both, Your Honor»

And of course I don’t — I think we have both.

Mr» Herrera

certainly indicated that — at the time of trial he indicated
that h©

was not willing to give up his seniority»

He was

earlier, but not at th® time of ferial»
So that certainly he raises it. And of course-we only
need one person to bring a class action*

And w© don’t have to

have -that person prevail necessarily, as Your Honor knows, to
proceed with a proper class action*
QUESTIONs

But you're also subject to -the rule,

aren’t you, that no person can represent a class of which he
is not a member, -which we have stated in our opinions*

That

is, that the named plaintiff has to have all th© characteristics
of th© class which he purports to represent*
MRS* MARTINEZ:

Well, I think w© have that, with our

named plaintiff, Mr. Herrera.
QUESTIONs Well, then — but should there have been

53

a division into classes, if one of them was willing to give
up his San Antonio seniority and on® wasn't?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Well, Your Honor, it would seem -to

me -that if we find -that that system is discriminatory ~~ and
we contend -that it is, and, in fact, the Fifth Circuit so held
"*- why should w© penally® people who, many years ago, when they
were first trying to transfer* to those jobs, weren't able to?
QUESTION3 Well, it might be discriminatory in either
I

aspsct, but, as Justice Stevens points out, there is some
difference, I think, in the question that’s raisec by someone
who says, "X want to be employed now, I'm a city driver in
San Antonio, and I'm not willing to give up anything I'v® got”,
and then the second man who says, ”1 want to b® employed now,
I'm a city driver in San Antonio, and I'm willing to give up
all prior benefits if you'll just put me on in Sar. Angelo."
MRS, MARTINEZ:

Of cours©, the bottom line problem

here, Your Honor, is that non© of them was permitted to
0

transfer, because of the no transfer rule.
They just basically let them file these applications
%

'

and then did not consider them.
QUESTION: Well, if non© of them wished to give up
any tiling that they had, you've got a different argument as to
the merits, though, than if someone says "I'll give up
everything I have if you'll just take me on .anew."
MRS. MARTINEZ:

I think it also is worth noting that

54
the letters, which I*ve described to you are in our Appendix,
weir© written by the company for the plaintiff, and they were
just making ©very effort they possibly could to get those
jobs which toey so badly wanted.

Even with those concessions,
%

the company refused their application.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Martinez, what do you say to the

suggestion of sending ifc back to the,trial court to zero in
and focus on whether or not this is a proper class action,
and what is the class?
What do you say to that suggestion?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think that the Fifth Circuit

certainly had before it an adequate record on which it made its

findings.

There is always the possibility of remand, of course,

for determination of toe sis© of the class,
QUESTION:

Well, what do you say to that stipulation

tet the only thing before to© Court is these tore® people?
MRS. MARTINEZ:

As I said earlier, Your Honor, that

stipulation was meant to define what was th© standard to he
used by the Court in determining whether or not there was
discrimination against the named plaintiffs.

In other words,

was toe failure to consider their applications discriminatory?
That was the clear thrust of th© stipulation,

Ifc did

not address th© class action issue.
QUESTION:

But. they used to® word "only", didn’t they?

The stipulation used to© word "only”, and I think that's what

55

they are relying on.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

I think the other possibility for

that would bs that, at that time, they were proceeding only
as to the individual plaintiff.

However, I think -shat the

record shows that, in. fact, it was tried as & class action.
As you know, it’s quit© «— well, it's quite common
to proceed in a bifurcated proceeding where you establish the
class first ~~
QUESTION:

I think it's quit.© common to make a

motion to have a class action and have the court rule on it,
up or down.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Justice Marshall, that is true.

And
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume, and

you may ansswer that, the first thing tomorrow morning.
MRS. MARTINEZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

[Whereupon, at 3:00 p.m., the Court was recessed, to
reconvene at 10:00 a.m«, Tuesday, January 11, 1977.1
