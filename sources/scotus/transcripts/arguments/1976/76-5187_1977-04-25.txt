MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-5187, Lee against United States.
Mr, Bauer, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH P. BAUER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. BAUER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
My name is Jcseph Bauer, counsel for petitioner,
Phillip O'erome Lee.
This case involves issues under the due process
clause the the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.
In Illinois against Somerville, this Court observed
%

that virtually all double jeopardy cases turn on the particular
facts. Therefore, I would like to begin this morning with a
brief statement of the facts, because that is essential for an
understanding of the issues presented in this case.
In December, 1973, a theft allegady occurred in the
United States Post Office.

A few weeks later, in 1974, a Feder­

al information was filed, charging the petitioner with that
theft.
Petitioner waived his right to trial by jury.
On the day of the trial, and prior to the introduction of any
evidence, counsel for petitioner moved to dismiss the information
because it failed to allege a vital portion of that information 1

that is, that theft requires that the act be committed knowingly
and with an intent to deprive the owner of the use of the prop­
erty.
QUESTION;

He had an opportunity to make such a

motion earlier in the proceedings, did he not?
MR. BAUER;
Honor.

He might have made it earlier, your

But in fact, as the record indicates, he was second

counsel for the petitioner, and he was appointed only seven
weeks before the trial.

And it clearly could have been made

earlier, but it might not have been reasonable to have done so.
And there's no contention that the objection here was not timely.
Clearly, the Federal rules of criminal procedure provide for
objection at any time during the trial.
QUESTION;

But my only suggestion is that an

attorney who makes a motion that late in the game may well find
a trial judge unprepared to pass on it at the particular moment
that he makes it.
HR. BAUER;

Your Honor, I think there are two responses
i

to that, inquiry.

One, in certain circumstances, the time rnay

be so late that it would be difficult for the judge to rule.
On the facts of this case, however, when petitioner's counsel
made the objection, petitioner's counsel cited a single
Indiana state case.

It would have been very, very easy for the

trial judge at that time to have taken a two minute or five
minute recess % looked tip the, single

.

The rule was as

5

simple as can be.

Now, that’s only known by hindsight.

But I suggest that the alternatives available at
that time would have been to look up that single case.
QUESTION;

Well, what was going on?

Wasn't jury

selection about to begin?
MR. BAUER;

No, your Honor, this was a bench

trial.
QUESTION;

Well, wasn't the Court about to

commence the hearing of testimony then?
MR. BAUER:

What had happened, your Honor, was that

the case had been called;the prosecution had made its opening
statement which lasted all of about 45 seconds.

The defendant's

counsel then appeared, and at the very first opportunity

on

that morning, defense counsel did raise the objection.
Now, as 'I suggested, your Honor —
QUESTION;

Well, Professor Bauer, couldn't he have

made the objection before the opening statement on the part of
counsel?
MR. BAUER:
he could have.

It's not clear from the procedure whether

As I suggested, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the

motion was made before evidence commenced„

Therefore, under

the tests

in this case, it was at a stage before jeopardy

attached.

Had the motion been acted upon at that time, there

would have been no bar whatsoever to correcting the information
and having a proper trial.

So that the defendant's motion

6
was clearly made before there would have been any double
jeopardy inquiry implicated.
QUESTIONS

So it is your position that jeopardy

had not attached?
MR. BAUER:

Well, the Court in the Serfass case

says that in a jury trial jeopardy attaches when the jury is
•3

empanelled, and that in a non-jeopardy case, jeopardy
attaches when evidence commences»
Now, the testimony had not yet begun.

So it is our

position that jeopardy had not attached at that time.

And it

seems that in this case, defense counsel had given the court
and equally important, had given the prosecution an opportunity
to correct that mistake, which was of the prosecution's own
creation.
But yet the prosecution sat .there and did absolutely
nothing,

Now —
QUESTION:

nothing.

Petitioner's counsel did absolutely

He didn’t object»
MR. BAUER:

Well, your Honor, the —
He said that the judge could have gone

out and looked at the case right quick.

He didn't suggest

that to the judge, did he?
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:
which he can now use.

What petitioner’s counsel —
He didn't do anything but file a motion

MR. BAUER:

It is true yourHonor that he did not

take a recess»

I respectfully suggest

QUESTION:

He didn't object at all.

The judge

says I will pass on it when I get time to look it up.
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:
MR. BAUER:

In fact ~
And counsel remained silent.
In fact, your Honor, although it does

not excise trial counsel, in fact there is an indication in
the

record that the trial counsel may have misunderstood

the ruling of the trial court.

There's a suggestion that when

all the evidence was concluded, petitioner's counsel thought
the the motion had indeed been denied, and not taken under
advisement.
QUESTION?

QUESTION:

Well, the record is correct that the

judge said specifically, I will pass on this when I get time

8

to look it up.
MR. BAUER:

No question, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And counsel said nothing?

MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:
MR. BADER:

That’s right, your Honor.
Well, could I say he acquiesced in it?
I think not, your Honor.
Why not?
I think that the objection that counsel

made to the sufficiency of the information carries with it
implicitly the request that the court will grant a recess
and look up the case.

Defense counsel did not merely say

the information is deficient.

Defense counsel cited the

court to a specific Indiana case, directly on points which held
that the information of this kind was deficient.
QUESTION;
MR. BAUER:

Did he read anything from the case?
He read only the citation to the case,

your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:

That's all?
Well, that's right.
Well, why didn't he read the case?

He

said it was so clear? why didn't he say, the bottom line in
the opinion says, quote, end quote.

That would give the judge

a little something, wouldn’t it?
VR. BAUER:

It would, your Honor.

I think there’s

a second response to that, Mr. Justice Marshall

9
QUESTION:

I think one response is that, under

your theory, he can make the motion and then there's no way
for him to lose,
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:
MR. BAUER:

I think the other response -Am I right?
That there's no way for him to lose?

Yes, there is a way for him to lose, because it seems to me
that in a case like this the Court -QUESTION:

Well, what could the government have

done at that stage?
MR. BAUER:
alternatives.

The government had a number of

One is that the government could have joined

in the motion of the defense to dismiss the information.

A

second alternative would have been to make a motion under
rule 7(e) to amend the information.
QUESTION:

A third opportunity —

MR. BAUER:

The government clearly, under Federal

Criminal Procedure 7(e) -QUESTION:

Well, whose case is it, the government

or the defense?
MR. BAUER:

The cases in this .Court make clear

that the responsibility for having a proper trial lies not
on the defendant hut lies with the prosecution and the court.
QUESTION:

That’s why you don’t have to object?

10
MR. BAUER%

It*s not a question of not having to

object, but having objected, having performed its responsibility,
if there is any duty, the duty already was on the prosecution
in the trial court.

The defendant fulfilled his responsibility

by pointing out to the trial court, and pointing out to the
prosecution the deficiency.

Well, then prosecution counsel was

hardly in a better position to have this —* take one of
these alternatives that you've suggested that the Court had
to decide this issue suddenly presented; is that not so?

II
MR. BAUER?

Mr. Chief Justice, it is true that

the prosecution was not given advance notice of the motion.

Hut

as I suggest in response to Mr. Justice Marshall's question,
the responsibility for having a proper trial is not solely on
the defendant? indeed, it is principally on the prosecution
in the trial court.
QUESTION?

Well, we can accept that.

We can

But — but you're

suggesting that this was so clear that everyone should have
been able to react right away.

If it was so clear, then why,

in seven weeks time since counsel had been appointed, had he
not made his motion before trial so as to give the government
and the court reasonable opportunity to analyze the issue?
MR. BAUERt
your Honor.

1 simply don't know the answer to that

We can only speculate.

counsel, Mr. Swanson, was the second counsel for petitioner.

And then after arraignment, he then asked to withdraw

hiv jnlf when he became associated with the magistrate.
QUESTION:

How —

Do you think defendant's counsel, in

court at that time, as an officer of the court as he is, as
you are, had an obligation to suggest, to the court the
possibility that delay in acting on that while he proceeded
to take testimony might create some serious problems In the

12
administration of justice?
MR, BAUER%

I think had he recognised the full

double jeopardy implications at that time, perhaps he might.
Trial counsel was a young, inexperienced man* had been
admitted to the bar for less than a year.
not excuse him.

Again, that does

But in the circumstances of this case, having

been appointed as the second counsel to petitioner, one ofthe
things that might have naturally happened upon his appointment
under the Criminal Justice Act was that he would have .initially
commenced doing research on the facts of the case, interview
defendant, interview potential witnesses.

And although

it was not the — it's clearly not the best trial strategy,
it might well be a reasonable thing not to look at the
language, the text of the information immediately.

Perhaps

not even look at the information until the day of trial,
t*m not suggesting that that's the best strategy®
But I'm suggesting that that was a reasonable course in -the
circumstances here.
QUESTIO?? j

You mean that when a lawyer defends

a case, the last thing he does is read the information?
MR. BAUERs

It certainly should not be the last

thing he does, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION 2
MR. BAUER:

Is that an excuse?
I*ra not. attempting to excuse Mr. Swanson's

13
conduct. *

What I’m suggesting is that in the case at bar,

the responsibility for having a proper trial was not solely
on the defendant, indeed, it was not principally on the
defendant.

The principal responsibility was on the

prosecution in the trial court.
I would ask the question, not why was Mr. Swanson
late in his motion.

I think a more appropriate question is,

why did the government draft a deficient information, and then
instead of asking why did Mr. Swanson wait seven weeks to noti.ee
that defect, why did the government wait four months and not even
notice it on the morning of trial?

When the very defect was

The prosecution was the one that made the

The prosecution —
QUESTION?

If nobody raised the question, and he

was convicted, he'd go to jail, wouldn't ha?
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:

Indeed, he would.
So there's a little bit of responsibility

on the petitioner? a little bit.
MR. BAUER:

There certainly is.

And in fact I'm

not suggesting that the mere error in the information is
sufficient to causa

to foreclose a second trial in the

situation you've described.
QUESTION:

But is there anything in the Federal

rules of criminal procedure, or in the local rules of this
district court in, what is it, the Northern District of

14
Indiana, that set a time period within which such a motion
could be filed?
MR* BAUERs

The Federal rules of criminal procedure

specifically provide that the motion is timely at any stage.
QUESTION;
MR. BAUER;

At any stage?
At any stage.

It may be noticed by ~

the rule says it may be noticed at any time during the proeeedings, any time during the pendency of the proceedings

Sb that rule , in your submission , means;

of any evidence, then there is an automatic double jeopardy

MR. BAUER;
submission.

No, your Honor, that is not our

Our submission is thattha reason double jeopardy

forecloses a second trial in this situation is because the motion
to lir.wtss the information was made prior to the attachment of
jeopardy*

There were numerous alternatives available to the

trial court to continue in the fashion it did. Numerous
alternatives available to the prosecution to continue.

Yet,

notwithstanding those alternatives, the trial court and the
p roaecution allowed the trial to continue not only into the
jeopardy stage, but through the entire evidentiary stage to the
vary moment when the verdict should have been forthcoming.
And then, at that stage, subjected the defendant to a second

Now, in response to your Honor's question,, a
different situation would bs posed if the motion were made

QUESTION:

But the — you tell me the Federal

rules of criminal procedure permit the motion to be made at
any time, before or after jeopardy attaches?
MR. BAUERs
QUESTION:

That's right.
And if the motion is made after

jeopardy attaches, and is granted, then there's a built in
double jeopardy defense to any future trial?
MR. BAUER:

No, your Honor, I think not.

do have the situation to which the respondent referred, the
Dinits kind of situation or the Somerville kind of situation,
in which one can explain that on one of two grounds: either

more than he asked for —
QUESTION;

This is not a rais-trial? this — the

basis of this motion is that the person should never have
been held before the court on a defective indictment such as
this .
MS. BAUER;
QUESTION:

But that —
The trial should never have begun? that's

the basis of the motion.
MR. BAUER*
Honor.

Well, that is indeed true, your

Mow, the court has made, clear In cases all the way back

to 1896 in Ball, that if a person is tried and convicted
pursuant to a defective indictment, that that person — and the
indictment has bean challenged on appeal, that that person
can indeed be re-tried without double jeopardy problems.

But

in this case, what we have is a situation in which, at the tine
the motion was made, the defendant had made the motion prior
to the attachment of jeopardy.

There were a whole host of

alternatives available to the trial court, and to the
prosecution, to proceeding.
QUESTION;

For purposes of your argument as to

double jeopardy, do you draw any distinction between the
declaration of a mis-trial and the dismissal of the indictment";
HR. BAUERs

Your Honor, there is a stronger case

17
for a dismissal, because a dismissal, as was suggested in the
Jenkins case, may well be ambivalent — ambiguous.
arguably a dismissal on the merits.

It may be

If it is, even though

mid-trial, that would preclude a re-trial.
QUESTION:

Here it clearly was not a dismissal

on the merits.
MR. BAUER:
on the merits.

Here it clearly was not a dismissal

The court characterized it as a dismissal,

but in our view, your Honor, whether it is characterized as a
mis-trial or characterized as a dismissal, the result in this
case must be the same.

Because although themotion was made

prior to the attachment of jeopardy, the court erroneously
allowed the case to proceed into the jeopardy stage all the way
up to the would-be verdict stage, and then dismissed -- or
declared a. mis-trial, without giving the defendant the benefit
of a verdict.
What the double jeopardy clause enunciates is a
dual policy.

It enunciates a policy against repetitive trials.

It also enunciates a policy in favor o! — once the trial has
commenced, the defendant is entitled to a verdict on the merits
QUESTION:

You said he wasn’t found guilty.

I

thought the judge said, this is about as guilty a man as I
ever ran across.
MR. BAUER:
observation.

Indeed, your Honor, the judge made tha

And there's no way that we can erase that from th<

13
record.

But I would suggest that what the double jeopardy

cases provided, starting with Wade against Hunter,, is that
one of the valued rights that a defendant has is the right to
get a verdict.

And the observation in this case, no matter

how much we analogize it to a verdict, was not a verdict.
One of the most difficult things that a trial
court must do in a bench trial is decide on guilt or innocence.
And one of the things that we would want to have is that that
determination be a deliberate, reflective one.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bauer, would your case be different

if Judge Eschbach had made findings of fact of guilt, and then
dismissed the indictment after that, or 'waited for a post-trial
ruling —• a post-verdict ruling?
MR. BAUER:

I think if there had been a formal

verdict of guilty, followed by a dismissal afterward, our
case would ba different.

And I would respectfully suggest that

the double jeopardy clause would probably, although I am not
willing to concede it, but might probably permit a re-trial.
That would be somewhere between the Ball case and this case.
i at situation, however, your Honor, might implicate due process
considerations nonetheless.
QUESTION:
the moment.

Well, let.*s take the double jeopardy for

If you say there could have been a re-trial, I suppose

you also then would acknowledge that if there had been a post­
trial dismissal on this ground it could have been appealed by

the government.
MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It could have been appealed by the govern/

ment notwithstanding the fact that if the ruling was affirmed,
there could be another trial.

If — you mean the ruling —

Appeals had affirmed the dismissal.

We

The government could still

re-indict, couldn’t it?
MR. BAUER;

Yes, they could, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And it could be another trial?

MR. BAUER:
QUESTION:

There could be, your Honor.
And even though there’s the possibility

of a second trial, raising all the fact questions, double jeopardy
would not apply?
MR. BAUER:

The reason for that, your Honor, was

because in your — in the situation which you posit, there was
indeed a verdict from which there is an appeal.

And no matter

how we analogize it, the judge’s outburst here was not a verdict.
QUESTION:

So the error you’re really complaining

of, then, boils down to the fact that Judge Eschbaeh didn't make
the right finding.

He didn’t allow closing argument.

20

MR. BAUER:

No, your honor, we are referring —

in this case there was a continuum of error.
errors at, the beginning of trial.

There were

Well, I should even start

before that.
QUESTION:
being so plain.

Well, but that rests entirely on the error

Lots of times a motion like this can raise a

rather complicated question, that the judge either has to ad~
journ the trial, or go ahead subject to ruling later.

But you

would you have a ruling that whenever such a motion is made
on the -- as trial commences, the judge has an absolute duty to
postpone the taking of evidence until he can rule on it?
MR. BAUER:

No, I would not, your Honor, although I

would respectfully suggest, what the trial judge should have
done was at least declare a five minute recess to determine whether
the question was complicated.

Now, if indeed the question were

one that would take two hours or two days research, in view of
the un-timeliness of the motion, it might be appropriate to
continue the trial at that time; might be.

I would suggest,

however, that a recess to determine whether it is a difficult
question, which recess — that recess, which would have onlytaken five minutes, would certainly not be inappropriate.

And

in fact, I would go beyond that and say, in this case that was
not the only alternative at the beginning of trial.

It was not

only that the trial judge could sua sponte have asked for a
recess.

But the 17.S. Attorney is also a member of the bar of

21

the State of Indiana.
QUESTION;

I just have a lot of difficulty with

the notion that the constitutional double jeopardy issue turns
on the time and the difficulty of the making of the motion.
MR. BAUER;
t

Well, it is not the difficulty of the

•>

motion that is the determinant, your Honor.

But what we have in

this situation was a motion which, granted with hindsight, was
as plain as could be.

clerk of mind had drafted something like that, I would sand him
back for a refresher course.QUESTION;
fact.

It was an egregious mistake,

Well, it's easy to say that after the

The trial judges who have to go ahead with trials, you

know; it's not that easy.
MR. BAUER;
QUESTION:

I don’t think any motion’s that easy,,
Your HOnor —

If it were so egregious, why did it

take the defense counsel seven weeks before he noticed it?
MR. BAUER;

Well, your Honor, I’ve referred to

•.hat. earlier, and I must respectfully suggest, I do not knew
the answer.

I can only speculate —
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps then you overstate when

you say it was so egregious.
MR. BAUER?

Well, one answer may be, he didn’t look

at the information at all.

As

soon as he did look at the

information, it leapt from the paper.

I didn’t suggest that

that was an appropriate form of pre-trial strategy.

Rut the

22

fa ct that it was obvious, and the fact that he did not catch
it earlier are not necessarily inconsistent.
QUESTION2

If you’re correct in your position,

perhaps the criminal rules should be amended to provide that
any motion not made, at least three days before trial, is
waived, the defect is waived„
MR, BAUER;

Your Honor, I would suggest that that is

— that that would be an inappropriate response.

In addition, X

-hink it is important, in terms of timeliness, it is important
to focus on two questions;

one, ^whether it was timely for the

purpose of raising it later; a second one, whether it was timely
for double jeopardy purposes,
I have sugge sted your Honor that had the motion
only been made after conviction and appeal, although it would
be timely at that stage, that would certainly not bar a re-trial..
But we do not have that situation here.

Hare we have a motion

that is not only timely, in the sense that the Federal rules
of criminal procedure provide. It is also timely in the double
jeopardy sense.

It is timely because it was made before

jeopardy attached, giving both prosecution and trial court a
number of alternatives to proceeding in a fashion in which
double jeopardy would attach.
QUESTION;

But this is — this is —

only a coincidence that this is a bench trial.

it*s only a

Suppose the

jury had been empanelled’and sworn, and then this motion had been

made.

What would you have -- what would the situation be

then?
MR. BAUER;
Honor.

Well, that would — excuse me, your

That would be closer to the Somerville case.
QUESTION;
MR. BAUER:

Double jeopardy would have attached?
That's right.

And then, in fact, I

think the inquiry would have to be at that stage considering
the reasonableness of the alternatives, would a recess be
appropriate.
4

QUESTION:

Well, what good would a recess be after

jeopardy had attached?
MR. BAUER:

Well, if indeed a -- had the jury

been empanelled, and the motion was only made at that time -~
QUESTION:

I should have said, empanelled and

sworn.
MR. BAUER:
under the Serf ass rule.

Empanelled and sworn, jeopardy attaches
If the defendant then had made the

motion only then, 1 would suggest that once again, as this Court
has suggested in recent cases, what the trial court would have to
do is waive the alternatives.

It may be at that time, since

the jury was already sitting there, that a recess would be
inappropriate.
The fact is, in this case, it was not a jury case.
And the important thing to focus on is, what are the
alternatives?

A recess would have been so simple.

Why did

24
the trial court judge not just say, okay, a single case has
been cited to me.

Let me take five minutes to look it up.

Why did the prosecution just sit there and do nothing.
QUESTION:

up the lav.

The judge made it very clear he needed to look

Counsel was present, and he remained silent.

If

you'd been the judge, wouldn't you have felt that you had the
acquiesence of counsel in proceeding with the trial?
MR. BAUER:

It might have been that the judge

thought that the counsel was not objecting, although there
is reason to believe that the counsel misunderstood the trial
court's ruling.

But leaving that aside, if the trial court —- if

the defense counsel had been deliberately attempting to use
this as a device to have double jeopardy apply,

then it would

have made sense for him not to make the motion until evidence
commenced.

Then it would have been a double jeopardy situation.

What defense counsel was doing was making the motion at a time
before jeopardy attached, giving the trial court and giving the
prosecution full opportunity to save themselves from an error
completely of the prosecution's making.

It was the prosecution

that drafted that faulty information, not the defendant.

So tt.cs

defense counsel gave them every opportunity to rescue themselves,
not only pointed out the defect, but cited an Indiana State

25
case.

And what did prosecution do?

Sat there and did nothing.

Alternatives: he could have joined in the motion to dismiss.
He could have moved to amend.

He could have suggested a recess.

The cases in this Court make clear that the duty should not be
on the defendant to not only raise it but continue to raise it
and protect his rights.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW

Mr. Frey.
l.

FREY* ESQ.*

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. FREYs

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Courts
This is the latest in a line of cases extending

31
back to the Onited States against Perez in 1824»

It involved

the question or the permissibility of re-trying a defendant
whose first trial terminated prior to a finding of guilt or
innocence by the finder of fact.
It is, in our view, perhaps the easiest to decide
of all of those cases, because it is governed by a clear and
simple consideration, that it was the defendant who sought the
pre-verdict termination, and

he got what he requested.

Now, before turning to the body of my argument,
I just want to make one point about the facts just to be clear,
There are two places in petitioner’s brief, page 17 of his
opening brief, and page 4 of his reply brief, he says that the
defendant objected to proceeding with the trial.
Now, we've been over this a. little bit this
morning.

I can't find in the Appendix anything that remotely

.cesar8b3.es an objection to proceeding with the trial,

what

happened was, he came in, waited until the trial began, and
the prosecutor had made his opening statement.

Ha than, raised

his objection, and the court upbraided him for the untimelinesis
of raising it, and explained the difficulty of dealing with the
motion at that time.
Nov?, on page 8 of the Appendix, there is a
statement that is somewhat ambiguous, and I just wanted tosay
what we think it means.

It's near the top.

QUESTION s

Nine?

MR. FREY:

Page 8 of the Appendix.

He says, I realize this is probably a little bit
out of order, but I think it should be considered by the Court
at this time.
Now, we do not take that to be an objection to
proceeding

with the trial when the judge later on refused to

g rant the motion at this time, but rather an apology on the
part of counsel for the fact that he was so late.
QUESTION:

What about the next sentence?

I was

in the case after the time had passed for such a motion to be
made?
MR. FREY:

I wondered about that.

QUESTION:

So I think you ought to refer to that

too, shouldn’t you?
*IR. PREY:

Well, I don’t think that it has any —

first of all, I can’t find in the rules — Mr, Justice Stewart
asked about that earlier — I could find no reference in the
local rules -*~
QUESTION:

— but it certainly explains, I should

think, on the face of it, why it is he didn’t make it until he
did.
MR. FREY:

I don’t believe — first of all, there

is no rule of court in the Northern District of Indiana.
QUESTIONs

Well, assume there isn't.

He may have

33
been wrong.

What was he* eight months at the bar, something

like that?
MR, FREYt

Well, 1 think that whatever

know what the explanation is for why

I don’t

he didn't raise it,

I

know of no rule that would have prevented him from raising
it sooner, and no requirement that he should wait until the
trial has oorisaenced to raise it,

I merely want to be sure that

there is no ambiguity on the fact that he did not object to
proceeding with the trial once the judge had tentatively
denied his motion subject to reconsideration at a later point
after a recess.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t a motion to dismiss an

indictment in a sense always a motion — an objection to
proceeding with a trial?
MR. FREY;

Well, no, it could be made in the form

of a motion in arrest of judgment, in effect.

But ~ and it can be made at any

We don’t dispute that he could make it in the middle of

the trial, under the rules.

The question is whether

for

double jeopardy purposes his delay in making the motion is —
the timing of his motion is significant.
QUESTIONS

Well, the timing of his motion might be

34
very significant, and yet* there may be no rule that requires
him, after the judge says, I'll pass on that later, to say,
judge, I want you to pass on it new.

I would ~ it would

take a fairly bold attorney, I would think, in many
courts, to suggest that.
MR. PREY:

Well, I don't think it would take a --

after all, as I will get to when I get into the body of my
argument, to us the critical factor in these cases for
double jeopardy purposes is that the defendant has the choice
whether to proceed with the trial or whether to stop the trial.
Mow the defendant may say, your Honor, there is a. double jeopardy
problem in this case.

I don't want to be subjected to a trial

on a faulty information, because if 1'n convicted, the recult
will be that I will have to be — and that set aside, as I know
it must be, the result will be that I will have to be subjected
to two trials.

He can say that.,

On the other hand, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed
out, he may very well prefer to gc ahead with the trial.

And

the -QUESTION:

The defendant never has it within his

own power to stop the trial.

That's entirely up to the judge.

The judge can just say. I'll reserve ruling on all that stuff.
We've got witnesses waiting.
MR. FREY%
did here.

We*'re going to go ahead.

Well, that's in affect what the judge

He tentatively denied the motion subject to

35
reconsideration later on-

The question is, what significance

is to be attached to the fact that the defendant suade it at
the particular point that he did make it.
Wow, we start our argument from a premise that is
unchallenged by petitioner, and indeed, that is not subject
to serious challenge, having been conclusively settled many
years ago in the Ball case.

If a defendant is placed on trial

on a defective indictment, and that trial leads to a conviction,
that is subsequently sat aside because of the defect in the in­
dictment, the double jeopardy clause does not bar a second trial,,
Nov;, this is so despite the fact that the second
trial will subject the defendant to continuing embarrassment,
uncertainty, anxiety and insecurity, will renew the ordeal
that the trial itself may represent, and will subject him to
the added expense that further defense ordinarily entails.
All of these considerations — I don't mean to minimise them,
because they principally underlie the strong policy of the
double jeopardy clausa against multiple trials in criminal
cases — have been placed in the scales by this Court, and
they've been found to be outweighed by the even stronger
societal interests in fair trials ending in just judgments.
Wow, in vaiw of the decision in Ball, it seems
quite clear — and I think my colleague, in effect, conceded
it — that had the court erroneously denied petitioner's
motion to dismiss the information, the double jeopardy clause

36

would nofc have barred a re-trial.

Petitioner's argument is

that because the district court ruled correctly and dismissed
the information in this case, he cannot be re-tried.

But if

the court had erred and denied the motion to dismiss, he could
have been re-tried.
To state the proposition —

because my colleague’s response to Ball was to say that — and
ray colleague's response to the problem that if his motion had

It should have been granted before

But of course that's true in Ball, and that’s true

in most of these cases, that the motion is made before trial?
the district court erroneously denies the notion, as he
initially did at the outset of this trial? the trial proceeds.
The defendant is subjected to the? trial, and after the trial
is over and he's convicted, the conviction is set aside because

40
of the defect in the information or indictment.
QUESTION:

What about the point that it could

have been amended?
MR. FREY:
amended.

Well,. I agree, it could have been

I,don't think that's dispositive for double

could have suggested an amendment, and then h® would have had
only one trial.

necessary in this case.

We don’t think it’s

Because we think it’s clear in this

case that this was not a finding on the merits by the trial
court in the defendant’s favor, which is what Jenkins suggests
may not be reviewable.

This was clearly a termination based

on a defect in the institution of the proceedings, and in no
way going to the merits; there were no findings of any kind.
QUESTION ’

But the reason it was not reviewable in

Jenkins was because of the necessity of further proceeding
with respect to the facts.
MR. PREY;

Wall, there are — there is a

necessity for further proceedings whenever a trial is terminated
prior to verdict.

This is a pre-verdict termination case,

42
which Jenkins was not.

And this is a case like Gori and

I

Somerville and Jorn, and then the whole line of —
QUESTION%

This fits into the mistrial category,

MR. FREY %

Well, that's — we think there is no

material difference.
Now, to conte back to Mr. Justice Stewart's point,
this case focuses on the difference, if any, between Ball
and cases in which there is one added element, that is, that the
trial, was terminated prior to a finding of guilt or innocence.
Now, that fact, the pra-verdict termination,
implicates only one interest other than those already considered
in Ball, that is protected by the double jeopardy clause, and
that interest is the

valued right of the defendant, as this

Court has described it, to receive a verdict from the fact­
finder at the first trial.
This Court has long recognized that a defendant
who asserts his valued right by objecting to a termination of
the trial can have his objection overriden only upon a showing
that the trial court reasonably viewed the termination as
manifestly necessary.
In Gori, in Downum, in Somerville, the defendants
asserted their desire to go to verdict by objecting to the
mid-trial termination.
the difficult question,

This Court was then confronted with
in each of those cases, whether the

43
ends of public justice sufficiently supported the decision of
the trial judge to deny the defendant the opportunity to submit
his case to the jury at that trial and possibility to terminate
the controversy then and there by means of an acquittal.

,

Jorn was a similar case because, in effect

the

defendant was deprived of any opportunity to register his
objection to the termination.
But in this case, petitioner

never disclosed the

slightest, interest in obtaining a formal finding of guilt or
innocence from the judge at the first trial? understandably
enough, in our viev?.

Nor when he made his belated motion

for dismissal following the prosecutor's opening statement,
and it was tentatively denied subject to later consideration,
did petitioner express any objection to proceeding with the trial.
Now, here, in urging that the double jeopardy clarae
barred a second trial, petitioner expresses two grievances
that he says justify the result ha seeks.

The first arises

fromthe fact that although the challenge to the information
came after commencement of the trial, jeopardy had not yet at.achedThus petitioner argues, he was forced to undergo a
trial that was doomed from the start because of the defect in
the information.

Inhis view this procedure necessitated his

undergoing two trials when the first of these was avoidable.
This argument, parenthetically, is virtually the
exact opposite of the defendant in Illinois against Somerville,

44
who insisted that his first trial was hardly pointless,,
even though it could not have led to a valid convictione in
view of the possibility of a valid and binding acquittal®
Petitioner's second complaint is that having been
forced to undergo trial on the defective information, he was
then deprived of the benefit of a finding, guilt or innocence.
Thera are two fatal flaws in his argument®

The

first is that the situation here was largely his fault because
of the tardiness of his challenge to the information.

And

I don't mean tardiness in the sense of :non~eompliance with
Rule 12, but for double jeopardy purposes in the sense of
the situation that was created.

MR. FREYs

In view of our alternative and

So you're not really relying on the point

you just made.
MR. FKEYs
principal Argument.

Well, unless the Court rejects our
I r»ean, wa don't think it's necessary

for us to win the case that there is this added factor, but

45
some people mayo
QUESTION s

You want to win the case?

MR. FREY:

Wall, yes.

The second point, and the one that's more crucial
in our view, is that petitioner never objected to having the
trial go forward, nor to its termination by grant of his
*

dismissal motion prior to a finding of guilt or innocence.
Petitioner seeks to excuse his silence by contending that the
burden rests on the court, or the prosecutor to prevent the
evils to which he now says he was subjected.
This position might have merit if it could fairly
be said that no defendant would ever wish to be placed on trial
on a defective indictment, or that trial having commenced, every
defendant would wish to proceed to verdict.
QUESTION:

Can I interrupt you right there?

isn't that same argument applicable to Jenkins?

Why

Because

■there the defendant did not object to the dismissal or
discharge a t the time the Judge made it without all the
necessary findings hadn't been made?
MR. FREY:

Well, it wasn't a pre-verdict

determination in Jenkins.
QUESTION8

And I think it's —

Well, but that’s the issue is whether

it was, because the court held, as I read the court's opinion,
that the reason it wasn't appealable was, there were some
more factual determinations necessary.

Now, why isn't that

46
just exactly like this?
MR. PREYs

Well, I don't think this fits — that

is, the judge though he was completing the trial, and that
he was making a finding on whether Mr. Jenkins had committed
the offense or not.

I think it’s quite clear, although the

government contended in Jenkins that that finding was based on
an erroneous view of the law, nevertheless, he did something
which was quite similar to what the judge did in Martin Linen,
that is, he determined that, as he understood the law, Mr.
Jenkins had not committed an offense.

I mean# I would like to re-argue Jenkins#

but I don't think that's timely this morning.

I think there

is not guilty of the offense, and the case in which, prior
to verdict, he determines that there is a facial defect in
the indictment.
Now, if I can come back to the petitioner's two
complaints, X would venture to say that most defendants would
be delighted with the prospects of having a first trial that
could result In a valid acquittal but not a valid conviction,
and at which they would be given a complete preview of the
prosecution’s case.
Of course, not all of them would necessarily, but
2 think some of them would.
Moreover, it seems likely that many defendants
in petitioner's position at the conclusion of trial, having
heard tl

judge's tentative assessment of the evidence, would

prefer not to have a formal finding of guilt entered.

In

other words, many defendants would consider that what
happened at petitioner's trial gave them the best of both worlds.
The fact of the matter is, that different defendants
*

it

X

will have different desires, and there's only one way that we
can know what a particular defendant's desires are in a
particular situation, and that is, if he tells us.

If he

makes no objection, it can reasonably be assumed that the
course adopted is not objection aisle to him.

He should not

later ha heard to say that ha retroactively objects to the
course that was pursued when such an objection conveniently

50
immunizes him from any exposure to conviction and punishment
for his crime.
To sum up, the position we urge is that the
double jeopardy clause fears a second trial in the following
circumstances.

First, when the first trial has ended in a

valid judgment of conviction.

Second, when the first trial

has resulted in an acquittal by the finder of fact.

Third,

when the first trial has been terminated prior to verdict,
as it was here, provided the defendant has objected to the

pre“Verdict determination or been deprived of any opportunity
to object, and the termination was not manifestly necessary.

and that would require an objection

on his part.
QUESTIONi

Thank you.

I understand.

Excuse me.

MR. FREY:

And fourth, when the defendant has been

forced to soak a termination of the first trial on account of
-irreparable judicial or prosecutorial overreaching designed tc
obstruct 'the rendition of a fair verdict at that trial.
In other cases, a second trial generally is not
barred by the clause, in our view.

Andparticularly pertinent

hare, a second trial would not be barred when the defendant

51
has sought

or agreed to a pre-verdict determination, rather

than asserting his valued right to receive the verdict of
the fact finder then hearing the case.
This general approach has, we submit, several
substantial virtues, and few, if any, drawbacks»

It is simple

to administer, and it provides a clear rule of decision for
the vast majority of cases of pre-verdict termination.
The Court must ask the question, which will dispose
of most of these cases, did the defendant object to the
termination?

If he did not object to the termination, the

double jeopardy clause would not bar a re-trial.

Only if he

did object to the termination must the Court go on to the
more difficult question of whether there was, in the
particular circumstances, manifest necessity,
Mow, our stress upon the defendant's role in
causing or accepting the pre-verdict terminationof this
first trial is —

Jorn?

Jorn, because in Jorn there ware two factors that were
critical?

?

the one that's most pertinent here is that Judge

Ritter simply stopped the trial and discharged the jury
before anybody had a chance to say anything.

Now in those

circumstances, I don't think we can assume that the defendant
acquiesced in, agreed, wanted the trial to stop;
QUESTION:

So Jorn is just unique.

MR. FREY:

Well, it's fairly unique.

Fortunately,

judges don't often act with that degree of abruptness.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, can I ask one other question?

The fatal defect, or one Of the — the critical point is the
defendant did not object to the pre-verdict termination.

Now-

in stating that, are you emphasising the fact that he made
the motion, or are you emphasising the fact that the time the
judge ruled, after all the evidence was in, h© didn't say in
effect, please don't grant ray motion?
MR. FREY:

Well, there — both factors are pertinent.

53
He could have protected himself.

If he made the motion as he

did here* and the District Court tentatively denied it subject to
reconsideration.

And then the District Court* after the taking

of the evidence and the recess* returns and says* I’m sorry
to see that this information is woefully deficient under
Indiana law* and I'm going to have to dismiss it* the defendant
could say* your Honor* I don't want my motion acted upon at
this time.

I will make it in arrest of judgment if you find

me guilty.

I want a finding of guilt or innocence.

I've beer

through this trial* and I want a verdict in this trial.
And if the defendant did that* then the judge
said* well* I'm sorry* 2 can't be bothered* or so on* then
I think* unlike Somerville — and we’ve suggested this in

our brief — there would rot foe manifest necessity for the
termination.

And I think under those circumstances* the

double jeopardy clause would bar a second trial.

So for those reasons we ask the Court to affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
