Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK J. KELLEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KELLEY;

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court;
We are her© appearing on behalf of th© petitioners in
this cause.

The Court might recall that I was here some three

years ago on this school desegregation case regarding th© ques­
tion then of whether the lower court had exceeded their authority
in ordering an inter-district remedy in the absence of an interdistrict violation.
In reversing, this Court at that time held 'that th®
constitutional right of the plaintiffs was to attend a unitary
school system within the City of Detroit and remanded the case
for formalation of a. decree to eliminate the segregation that
existed within that city.
Following the remand and pursuant to the order of th©
District Court, the plaintiffs and the Detroit Board of Education
each filed a desegregation plan.
solely with pupil reassignment.

The plaintiffs' plan dealt
It contained no educational com­

ponents .
As & matter of

fact? during the plaintiffs’ expert

4
testimony in the remedy stags, their expert testified that the
plaintiffs’ plan would in fact eliminate the segregation found
to exist in Detroit.
On the other hand, the Detroit Board of Education’s
plan, in addition to recommending proposing pupil reassignment
for the first time, included thirteen so “called educational com­
ponents at a projected cost of $30 million annually to its plan.
And the Detroit Board in addition d@nended that the cost of
these expanded educational programs b® paid by the petitioner's
who are state officials in the State of Michigan in the execu­
tive branch of government and the money corns from unappropriated
state funds.
QUESTION?

The Board of Education, the Detroit Board

of Education was at that time a defendant, in the case, wasn't it?
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

,

Do you think you would have any standing

that the state officials would have any standing here if the
Detroit Board had agreed with the District Court's order and the
District Court's order had sought to impose no financial burden
on the stats officials?
MR, KELLEY:

Probably not, Mr. Justice.

The plaintiffs

at the time that the Detroit Board of Education made this recom­
mendation and their plan responded to the court by pointing out,
the plaintiffs themselves pointing out that in the findings
there were no violations with respect to educational components.

5
Yet, ia November of 1975 the court, the lower court then
entered its order concerning pupil reassignment, a desegrega­
tion plan involving some 27,000 students in 105 schools out
of 300 zoned schools in Detroit.

This desegregation plan was

peacefully implemented in the second semester of January 1976.
We submit that, for the purposes of the remedy in this cause,
based on the last time we were here, that the implementation
had taken place.
Yet, on May 11 of that year, 1976, the District Court
entered another order and its judgment directed that there h©
ten educational components to be put into effect system-wide
in September of 1976 and each year thereafter for th® expanded
educational components of reading, guidance counseling, testing
and in-service training..

Ana th© trial court ordered the state,,

th© petitioners to pay half of the excess cost of implementing
the

system-wide expansion of existing educational components

from unappropriated funds of the state treasury.
Nov;, pursuant to 'the court's order, the Detroit Board
disclosed that for the previous year,
million on these four components.

'75-76, it had spent $75

it also pointed out that the

expanded order of the court as to these four components would
cost

in excess of $11.6 million for the '76-77 school year.
Then on August 4,

1976, the Court of Appeals in

Cincinnati affirmed th® lower court, compelling the system-wide
expansion of existing educational programs to b© financed with

6

additional unappropriated funde from the state treasury.
After unsuccessfully seeking a stay, on October 18,
1976, the state treasurer of Michigan issued a warrant in the
amount of $5.8 million of unappropriated state funds from the
state treasury and paid the same to the Detroit Board of
Education.
Now, in affirming the District Court, the Court of
Appeals did so, and I quote, "without prejudice to the right, of
the District Court to require a larger proportion of payment
by the State of Michigan if found to he required by future de­
velopments."

And it is this judicially decreed blank check to

bs filled in each year and presented for payment of unauthor­
ised funds upon the treasury of the State of Michigan that we
are asking this Court to reverse.
QUESTION:

Is it you?: view that you must challenge all

of it now, the open end, the blank check, as you call it, or
if you did not prevail now do you consider that you should be
free to challenge, the next, order allocating funds?
MR. KELLEY:

Mr. chief Justice, I believe that because

of the factor that -there was no adjudication in this case of
any violation, any constitutional violation with regard to
educational programs in the Detroit school system, that as soon
as the, lower court, in its remedy got into educational compon­
ents, it was beyond its jurisdiction and in violation of the
principles of this Court as laid down in Swann and every

7
succeeding case thereafter# including the last time I was here
when the Court had there exceeded its remedy.
The Detroit Board doesn’t need a federal court order
to expand education.
QUESTION:

The only reason for this Court -Is it your position that if the absence of

that finding is critical# -that the findings that were made
would justify a transportation remedy and no other?

Is busing

the only permissible remedy# in your view?
MR. KELLEY:

We found that any. reasonable type of

pupil reassignment would be available because tins violation
found in the lower court# Mr. Justice# had to do with pupil re­
assignment# and -that is all that was found.

There is no

violation of guidance education components or financing ■—
QUESTION:

Is it your response to my question that

that is the only permissible remedy?
MR. KELLEY;

Any reasonable remedy having to do with

pupil reassignment would not necessarily be confined to busing#
in ray judgment.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

But it would have to be pupil reassignment?
That’s correct.
Mr. Attorney General# in that, connection —

and I want to be sure — I take it you are arguing basic lack oi:
power in the court or are you arguing the existence of power bub
an abuse of it here?
MR. KELLEY:

I believe that# following Swann# when

8

there was no finding by the Court of a violation having any­
thing to do with, educational components, that in these desegre­
gation cases it would be beyond the power of the Court in this
case.
I also feel that the act of the Court, hare is also
doing violence to the principle of federalism as laid down in
the Rizzo case.

I also feel that it is doing — it is violative

of the decisions with regard to the Tenth and Eleventh Amend­
ments also in this matter.
QUESTION;

Suppose, Mr. Attorney General, that the

District Court made the finding, the explicit finding that "X"
number of children in the schools, all of this based on expert
testimony and surveys, th© usual way, that "X" percentage of
students were suffering under a handicap, a language or speech
handicap, that is problems of ghetto life and ghetto speech,
and that to bring them into the mainstream with their peers in
the school after th© reassignment, special speech, remedial
speech programs were necessary.

Now, there is no such finding

hare.
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:
Blackman*s question.

That's correct.
This is really somewhat like Justice
Are you now challenging the power of the

Court to do that, or are you challenging here that no such —
no findings war© made to support these specific educational
components as they are described?

9
MR. KELLEY:

Wall, I think, first of all, in answer

to your question, the first part is that, y©s, there was no
finding and therefore it. is beyond the remedy power of the
Court.
Th© second part, I don't believe that this is an ex­
ception under the Fourteenth Amendment, where the Court could
come in and compel payment of money from a state treasury for
some inequity found.

I have never known of any statute or any

congressional act that lets us do this in a school desegregation
case.
I haven't thought ahead to th.© principal part of your
question, however, because, I have been concentrating on th®
fact that there was no violation here, and the thrust of my
argument
QUESTION:

Do you think that a similar remedy would

have been forbidden in Brown v. Board of Education?
MR. KELLEY:

I believe on th© findings, th© Brown case

was strictly pupil reassignment, I think that —
QUESTION?

Even though the Court observed that segre­

gated education was unequal?
MR. KELLEY:

If th© Court observed, then I think that

there is a possibility that something could have been done.
it is not true in this case.
QUESTION:

Otherwise how do you go about finding a

constitutional violation in this case, any?

But

10

MR. KELLEY:

Proofs were taken in this matter, in

the Detroit case. Your Honor, with regard to this matter of
educational components and finance.

The court did not become

convinced by that evidence and there were no findings.

as laid down in Brown# on® and two# and then in Swann and then

nature of the violation and —

QUESTION:

By segregating this group of school

children on the basis of th© color of their skin# and th© remedy
is to desegregate?
MR. KELLEY;

That’s correct, and I believe that that

is what this Court said the last time in finding a violation in
Detroit only and ordering a remand that the plaintiffs' rights
in this case were to a unitary school system within th© confine©
of th© City of Detroit, that there having been no showing on th©
record of any finding of an inter-district violation or viola™
tion of any district outside of Detroit, and now w® are back
her® again on a remedy where there has been no showing that
there was & violation of the financing of the Detroit school
system or any violation with regard to educational components
or the quality of education within the school system.

12
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, Judge Roth in 1972

did find uncontroverted evidence of the need for remedial,
measures? didn’t he?
MR. KELLEY2
QUESTION:

It is not in the order
"Uncontroverted evidence in the plans filed

by every party that certain educational components, including
in-servic© training, testing evluation, would b© essential to
any pl.an.ri
MR. KELLEY:

Well, I can only say to Your Honor at

this point that Detroit has in fact a unitary school system,
that in the last year,

'75-76, we spent $75 million on those

four components that Judge DeMascio now wants expanded in a
remedy phase, so that we are committed to this program, and it
is part of a unitary school system.

But if in fact the record

as we sea it did not show that there had been any constitutional
violation of plaintiffs* rights with regard to accusation and:
finding of inequity in the educational components or in the
quality of education or in the financing of the school system,
then I believe it is beyond the power of the Court now from the
remedy stage to order educational components.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t your case in behalf of state

officials somewhat different than would b© a case that could b©
made on behalf of the i 1 atroit Board of Education if they ob­
jected to this order — which I take it they don’t — but if
they did object, they could make the same arguments that you

13
have just been reciting, that it goes beyond the scope of the
violation, it intrudes too deeply into the authority of the
local officials, that type of argument?
But I had thought one of. your additional arguments on
behalf of your state officials was that, conceding that all of
those things would be ruled in favor of the Court of Appeals,
nonetheless th© Eleventh Amendment prevented the Court from
requiring th© state officials, as opposed to the Detroit
officials, to pay for it?
MR. KELLEY:

Well, we feel that Edelm&n v. Jordan, a

case in this Court, would apply, where the Court reiterated the
rule that a suit by private parties to impose a liability be
paid from a state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
Now, our constitution in Michigan provides that no
money shall b© paid out of the state treasury except pursuant
to appropriations made by law.

The people of Michigan have

imposed th® appropriations power in th© elected representatives,,
They have not waived the Eleventh Amendment in any way and, as
a result, I believe we do have the protection.
1 think we also have the protection of the language
of Rizzo, where th© Court reaffirmed, the principle of federalism
that limits the injunctive power of federal courts over
officials in th© executive branch of stats and local govern­
ments .

QUESTION:

But there

14
MR. KELLEY;

It is just a matter of administering the

educational system without finding.
QUESTION:

But in Rizzo you were talking about a city

police official —
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

That’s right.
-- the chief of police of the City of

Philadelphia, who doesn't have Eleventh Amendment protection.
MR. KELLEY;

That's correct.

That is absolutely true,

but
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, if you are correct,

as I remember the findings, there was a finding of violation by
the state, the state was guilty of some constitutional violation.
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
Is there any remedy at all that, could fo©

ordered against the state.?
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

Well, the state has already paid —
Any remedy that could be ordered by a

federal court?
MR. KELLEY;

Only having to do with a correction of

the remedy of pupil reassignment and any part that the state
could play.

Now, the state —

The state —

The state was ordered to —

15

QUESTION;

Could the state be made to pay a portio»,

of the cost of buying the new buses and the transportation?
MR. KELLEY;
250

The state board did pay the cost of

—

QUESTION;

Could it be ordered to do so?

MR. KELLEY;

It did so, but it did so within state

law.
QUESTION;

But could it. be ordered to do so was my

question.
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

Yes, it was ordered to do so, Your Honor,,
Could it be ordered to do so, consistently

with your theory of the case?
MR. KELLEY;

Well, as it turned out, the payment of

•the buses in this case was done within the state constitution
and —
QUESTION;

What I am trying to find out is, under

your view of the law, there any remedy that the federal court
could order against the state?
answer.

I donJt seem to find any in your

You say you have don© some things voluntarily, but you

seem to dispute the power of the federal court, to grant any
effective remedy against the state, is that correct?
MR. KELLEY;

No, I believe that in pupil reassignment

that they could issue any order that was reasonable to correct
the federal violation.
QUESTION;

Including compelling the state to contribute

16
to the cost of purchasing new buses?
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION;

That's correct.
You would agree to that?

MR. KELLEY:

I would agree to that.

But I would also

point out that, as far as the Tenth Amendment is concerned, it
would also apply here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you do concede that

the state could have been ordered to pay for buses?
MR. KELLEY:

It can be ordered because in this par­

ticular situation there is a law that provides for the state to
participate in the. payment of buses.

It would not bs in viola­

tion of the state constitution or the state law.
QUESTION:

Do you mean the state waives the Eleventh

Amendment -MR. KELLEY:

It did not waive it but in practical

effect we paid for 25 percent of these buses, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

What about the Eleventh Amendment?

What

happens to your Eleventh Amendment argument if you are going to
concede that the state could have been ordered to pay for the
buses?
MR. KELLEY:

I don’t concede that the state has

waived the Eleventh Amendment in the abstract in the. hypothetical
questions posed to me by Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

No, no, in answer to my question.
Right.

17
QUESTION £

How do you reconcile your Eleventh .Amend­

ment argument with your concession that you could b@ ordered to
pay for busing?
MR. KELLEY:

We could pay for busing only to the

extent -QUESTION:

Now, how could you be ordered in face of

your Eleventh Amendment argument?
MR. KELLEY:

I don't — I believe that the Eleventh

Amendment would have to be argued in that case and that the
state would have to he defended on the Eleventh Amendment be­
cause in anything w© have done in this case, the state has not
waived its Eleventh Amendment.

So what is misleading about

this case is that we were able to buy the buses within state
law and under the state constitution by future appropriation
methods, and so the issue has never been drawn.
QUESTION:

Whos© plan is it that includes these educa­

tional components?
MR. KELLEY:
Mr. Chief Justice.

It was the Detroit Board of Education,

It was not in the plaintiffs' plan.

QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

And accepted by the District Court?
It. accepted ten, I believe, of the — it

accepted nine and put one plan of his own into th© situation,
and in effect in a remedy wa ar® asking for — it is a situation
where there is a remedy being directed against us without a
violation, and I believe that it follows th© dictate of this

18

Court ia Swann.

I believe the federalism argument will apply,

and I also believe that the Tenth and Eleventh Amendment would
also apply because of our state constitution and the fact that
wa have not waived, nor is there any exception under section 5
of tha Fourteenth Amendment involved here, where you could
order the compulsion of payment of state monies, as you did in
the case of — I believe it was not Griffin but -QUESTION:
ME. KELLEY:

Section 5 applied to Congress.
Congress* law, and then, of course,

the -QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

It didn't apply to

US.

Well, the Court reaffirmed the principle

in Rizzo with, regard to courts, even though that was local
officials.
QUESTION:

The Congress shall have power to enforce by

appropriate legislation.
MR. KELLEY:

Fitzpatrick, the Fitzpatrick case, I'm

sorry, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It says Congress, it doesn't say anything

about us.
MR. KELLEY:

Well, there is no statute here that

would have enabled the lower court to use that power.
QUESTION:

I thought, you said that we could use

section 5.
MR. KELLEY:

No, I'm sorry, there was no congressional

19
act that would have enabled the lower judge to make an excep­
tion.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

All right.
And the case I have referred to earlier

was where there was a section 5 exception, in Fitzpatrick v.
Bifczer, having to do with employment discrimination, and there
was authority for the payment of state funds and ordered by the
federal courts, but we don’t have that present in this case.
And I just believe that, despite the noble purpose, the lower
court has once again gone into a remedy situation without a
violation having been found in the record, and it beyond the
power of the court to do so, and I think it not only fails to
follow the principle of a remedy being v/ithin the scope of the
violation, but it also violates the Eleventh Amendment and the
Tenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

When the court approved substantially the

greater part of the proposed plan, 9 of the 13 parts, as to
those 9 parts, isn’t that a finding of the District Court of
the need of those components in the total educational process?
MR. KELLEY:
record.

I felt that w© would b© bound by the

There was no opportunity at that point to properly

put forth — I don't believe at that stag© that the court was
authorized to make a finding because I don’t believe that the
record supported it, and I think that the last time we were
here we included this matter, the judgment had been entered and

20

in that judgment there was no showing in the record of a viola­
tion.
QUESTION;

Well, the state — did you have an oppor­

tunity to challenge the court’s approval of the plan to the
extent it approved it?
MR. KELLEY;

Yes, but only to the extent in an ad­

visory capacity at that point in the proceedings, Your Honor.
I don't think that we had th© same standing at that point as wa
had during the trial of the matter.
QUESTION;
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

You were a party?
Pardon?
You were a party to the litigation?
That’s correct.
You weren’t just an amicus or an inter-

venor?
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

No, no.

That's correct, w© are a party.

So you got notice, I assume, ©f a haarirg

and —

MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION;

Oh, yea.
— had an opportunity to say what you

wanted to say, didn’t you?
MR. KELLEYs

But I honestly believe that at that point;

in the proceedings, after the trial — and we must remember
that the late Judge Roth was the original trial judge in this
matter, and we are. faced with, a situation where a succeeding

21
judge cam® into the matter after the case was tried a ad the
record was developed.
QUESTION?

Did it go to Judge Defias cio as soon as it

came back on the remand, after Judge Roth’s death?
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

That is correct.
He has had it ever sine©?
He has had tli® case ever since, Mr.

Chief Justice, that is true.

We feel that this case, as far as

the Eleventh Amendment is concerned, does follow the doctrines
laid dovsi in Edeim&n, where the Court reiterated the rule that
a suit by privata parties to impose liability is barred.

And

even though the state is not named a party in this case,
Edelman held that where ihe effect is the compelling of money
from the state treasury, which is what happened here, that the
state by that act does become a party.

And what w© have hare

is a direct compulsion of money from the state treasury, it is
not scan© ancillary effect or some prospective injunctive relief.
In addition to that, I think th© language of the
Court of Appeals is important when it said that this could be
done annually, that we could come back here annually and take
unappropriated funds from the state, and I believe that w©
would have a repetition of Eleventh Amendment violations.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, on the remedy ques­

tion, would the case be different if the decree, instead of
saying you pay 50 percent of the costs, it said you provide th©

22
books and you provide -the teachers and you provide the testing
materials and one thing -- asked you to provide a lot of
services and facilities, rather than just plain dollars, would
that present a different issue?
MR. KELLEY:

I don't think sc.

I should also point

out that, you know, this is not -- this school district is
among the highest 20 percent in the state in per capita expendi­
tures.

This year, the state of Michigan will appropriate under

proper

appropriations from its state treasury to th© City of

Detroit $192.5 million, in addition to any local taxation or
federal help that they get.

They are among the higher par

capita school districts in th© state.

We have not. been parsi­

monious with them.
What the petitioners and the stats object to is th®
ordering of unappropriated funds, in violation of our constitu­
tion, from the state treasury in the absence of any constitu­
tional violation.

That is what we are here for.

QUESTION;

Well, there was a finding by Judge Roth

that th© state had participated in the situation that existed,
th© violations.

That was not challenged in the original

Mil liken v. Bradley,, and I think the opinion said that that
finding was left undisturbed, if I recall correctly.
MR. KELLEY:

Wall, I don't believe there has ever been

a finding that the state of Michigan or any of the defendants,
for that matter, have bean involved in a constitutional

23

violation with regard to educational quality or with regard to
financing.
QUESTION :

But there was a finding by lower courts?

and I gather not challenged here —*
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

With regard to pupil reassignment.
-- well, that the state had participated

in racial discrimination in the operation of the schools.

That

is what the finding was.
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And that is what is not challenged.
That’s correct.
And you do not challenge that?

You cannot

challenge that, can you?
MR. KELLEY:

We cannot challenge that, Your Honor.

We are only challenging the remedy that, is being used hare
beyond the nature of the violation and in violation of the
Eleventh Amendment.
We now have a unitary system in Detroit, that I don’t
believe anybody can question.

And the desegregation and the

implementation for the elimination of that desegregation has
bean accomplished and was accomplished in January of 1976 and
there is no complaint from anybody on that score.
If it pleas© th© Court, we will reserve any time we
have remaining.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, DETROIT BOARD OF
EDUCATION
MR. ROUMSLLs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is ©bout a remedy for a state imposed con­
dition of segregation in the Detroit School District that was
caused by two separate and distinct, defendants, the Detroit
Board and the State of Michigan.

Footnote 16, Millikan I,

verifies this, and ©gain, in the Gautxeaux case, at Footnote 13,
this Court reaffirmed that finding •— two separate, and distinct
defendants.
The state defendants here are attempting to twist this
Court's statements in Swann and Millikan that the nature of the
violation determines the scop© of the remedy.
here is segregation.
meat.

The violation

This is more than unlawful pupil assign-

The scop© of the renedy has more than just to do with,

pupil reassignment.
In Brown —
QUESTION:

Wasn't that the violati.©n, segregation of

pupils based upon their race or ethnic background?

There was

no claim, was there, of inequality other than that, of inequality
among the various schools, was there?

25
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor, in this respect —*

This was a separate but equal system and

that was the violation, wasn't it?
MR. ROUMELL:

Your Honor, the r©cox’d evidence in this

case shows that as the schools in Detroit evolved, one black
school, two black schools, three black schools, and so forth,
and th© black children cam© into the Detroit system with the
sama capabilities and x^ith the same potentiality to learn that
by th© time they reached the eighth grade in th© Detroit
schools, on an average, th© record reveals that the black
children were reading at a sixth grade level -QUESTION:

Well, was that ever alleged as a constitu­

tional violation?
MR. ROUMELL:

That is the effect of segregation in

Detroit.

QUESTION:

Well, why does it have that effect on black,

children and not on white children, if it is the effect of
segrega tion?
MR. ROUMELL:

Because, Your Honor, one of the major
\

reasons for this reading disability is unfortunately teacher
perceptions toward the ability of their students to learn, and
th® record evidence i», this case shows that there was low
teacher expectations in the developing black schools in Detroit.
It was an unfortunate result, proven in the record, and we
refer the Court to our supplemental record, at pages 1 to 23,

26
where we laid that: out in the violation stage.
Furthermore, the record also shows, Your Honor, that
in testing, cur testing proved in many cases to be culturally
biased, and in many cases unfortunately resulted in the track­
ing of black students.

Again, I refer to the record, 1 to 23

of our supplemental record.
QUESTION;

Well, to get back to my original question,

am I mistaken in my understanding that the only constitutional
violation found in this litigation was segregation of students
based upon their color?
MR. ROOMELL?
QUESTION;

That is correct, but the effect of —

Or the assignment, of students because of

color?
MR. ROUMELL:

It was &n evolving process and the

effect of —
QUESTION;

Evolving or not, that was the constitution/

al violation?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

And the only constitutional violation?

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

That was the constitutional violation.

And tlie state constitutional violation.

Well, w@ are concerned here with only the

federal Constitution violation.
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

I mean the state defendants —

They were also found to be violators?

MR, ROUMELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

And what we are saying

27

is that this was an effect of that violation, and it also had
an effect, as the violation record established, in the
counseling, it institutionalized the concept of bias.

For

example, in a majority black school, fox- some reason in our
aero mechanics school, where w© were training children to go
into the aircraft industry, we had an 30 parcent whit© enroll­
ment.

Black children were not being counselled into that edu­

cational opportunity.
And so on® of the purposes of equity is to restore,
restor® the children to where they would have been but for
this vidious segregation in Detroit.
Now, in addition, when we get to the remedial stag®
of the hearing, not only does the record, without exception,
confirm what I have just said, but in addition the state
defendants, through their own witnesses -- and I must call the
Court’s attention to the fact that after the Detroit Board
presented their plan, the state was asked t© present a
critique and the state in their critique said, yes, we agree,
to overcome the obstacles to

desegregation in Detroit, you must

have a counselling program designed to eliminate the effects
of segregation, you must have an unbiased testing program, and,
by all means, you must have an in-service training program.
QUESTION:

Where do you find that in her®?

MR. ROOMELL:

Pages 18 to 24 of the brief of the

Detroit Board of Education, where we cite the references to the

28

to the appendix aad actually quote from the testimony of the
state’s defendants’ own witness, plus our witnesses, plus the
witnesses of the plaintiffs,
QUESTION:

May I ask you some questions?

MR. ROUMELL;
QUESTION;

1 understand that there were four --

MR. ROOMELL:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

— in-service teacher training, counselling,

testing, ard remedial reading.

How long has Detroit had all

four of those components in its school system?
MR. ROUMELL;

Your Honor, we hav© had those components?

in our school system for some time, but wa hav® not had •—
QUESTION:

Wait just a minute.

Do you know any major

school system in the United States that, doesn’t have them or any
school system that hasn't had then for a quarter of a century?
MR. ROUMELL:

I do not, but the components w© are.

speaking of —
QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

Is there

any finding in this record that any os,© of those systems was
enforced in a discriminatory way?
MR. ROUMELL:

Your Honor, two things, if 1 may answer

the question in two parts:

The components we are speaking about

her© ar© not the routine educational programs in any school
system.

These ar© restoration, overcoming obstacle programs.

They are designed to teach counsellors, for example, to be

29
prepared in prevention crisis.

They are designed to open up

career opportunities to the black children that have been de­
prived of than in Detroit.

The reading program is designed •—

for the first time we have not had remedial reading at the
high school level

we are finding children, who went through

our system, a desegregated school system, and not bs able to
read at the high school level.
QUESTION:

I understand that and I am in favor of all

of those, but my question is what constitutional violation was
found with respect to any one of these components?
MR. ROUMELL:

The constitutional violation was a

violation of segregation and —
QUESTION:

And you could give me that answer if I ask

you whether the teaching of mathematics or history or civics or
any other subject in the schools, you could say it is being
taught inadequately, that segregation was the cause, could you

not?
MR. ROUMELL:

No, I could not, Your Honor, for this

reason —
QUESTION:

Then tell me why.

MR. ROUMELL:

Because the second prong, not only the

question of restoring but overcoming the obstacles.

When you

bring the children into the Detroit system, into a desegregated
system — Dr. Foster pointed out, and we pointed, out in our
brief, in the testimony, you bring children into a classroom

30
thai have all different levels of reading# you incur difficult
teaching problems and eventually the children who have been
discriminated against, who have been the victims of low
teacher expectations begin to daydream and eventually we have
the horrible, horrible situation in Detroit of black dropouts.
Now —
QUESTION:

My understanding is that 75 percent of

the pupils are black, is that correct?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

79 percent, Your Honor.

7 9 percent.

Has discrimination occurred

with respect to all 79 percent of the pupils of the Detroit
school system?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

System-wide.

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:
School Board?

It was system-wide.

That was a finding of Judge Roth.

What is the composition of the Detroit

You. have five members system-wide, don't you?

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we have 13 members, sir.

Well, what is the composition of that

board?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

At the present time?

In terms of race?

Yes.

MR. ROUMELL:

Nine black and four whits.

31

QUESTION:

You have regional boards, don't you, eight

of them?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What is the composition of the eight re­

gional boards?
MR. ROUMELL:

They vary from region to region.

Some

regions are virtually all black, others have —
QUESTION:

How many are virtually all white?

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

There is a mixture, Your Honor.

Well, how many have a majority of whit©

members?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

Two out of the eight?

MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

Two, I believe, Your Honor.

Two or three.

And they are discriminating against them­

selves, are they?
MR. ROUMELL:
at the present time.
QUESTION:

Your Honor, they are not discriminating
They are trying to correct the remedy.

When was this discrimination in these four

component programs?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

In these four components, Your Honor ™

Does the record show when there was any

discrimination?
MR. ROUMELL:

The record shows that at the time this

lawsuit; was begun, and during the course of the lawsuit there

32

was desegregation, this evolving process, and the effect of
this was the reading, the counselling, the problems that I
have outlined above, produced by the evidence on this record,
the hard evidence.

And then when we get to the. remedial stages

the educators, without exception, including the state's own
witness, says that in order to make desegregation work in
Detroit, in. order to make it work in Detroit, w© have to have
these programs, and these programs are not spending $75 million
for additional programs, these are new programs -QUESTION:

May I ask you this:

between your counsellors and pupils?

What is the ratio

How many pupils per

counsellor in the Detroit school system?
MR. ROUMELL:
QUESTION:

Approximately 400.

How does that, compare with national aver­

ages?
MR, ROUMELL:

The North Central Association proposes

300 to 350.
QUESTION:

300 to 350 is considered the best rela­

tionship, but Detroit is better than average?
MR. ROUMELL;
We are a large system.

Your Honor, we have problems in Detroit
We have large dropouts of students.

We

have tension problems caused by the. desegregation that wa are
trying to work out.

We can't explain why many of our students

— we have to counsel them into the systemwide schools so they
can participate in desegregated education.

Part of our tools

II
33
in the educational componant are just one tool, a part of the
whole tool is a whole syst©n of drawing children of both races
into the various schools, and we have to counsel them so their
parents know about the availability of these opportunities.
QUESTION;

May I say this;

I am very sympathetic to

the problem, that many school systems in the United States are
inadequately staffed.

I know people in this business who think

there ought to be a counsellor for every 200 students.

Suppose

the District judge had decided that, that ought to have been the
ratio, and instead of ordering $11 million, he ordered $22
million, you would be here supporting that, wouldn't you?
MR. RGUMELL;

Your Honor, two questions, if I may;

Number cns, he didn’t decide that? and, number two, the state
of Michigan at every opportunity said he was incorrect in what
he was ordering.

As a matter of fact, one of these programs

was a. joint submission to the court, the testing program.

They

had every opportunity and nowhere in the record, nowhere in
this record have they challenged that these programs are needed
to restore, to overcome the obstacles.

We are putting

counsellors in other areas in ths Detroit system so that,
particularly in. our middle schools, so that our children can
gravitate toward the city-wide schools and the magnet schools
in order to make this desegregation plan work.
It is a Detroit situation, it is a way segregation
evolved in Detroit, it is the way the — the only way we can

34
remedy the situation, because if we do not, if we do not
utilise these tools, the children in Detroit will continue to
have the lingering badges of segregation on them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roomell, are you saying in effect that

in the school system which, as Detroit is, is 79 percent Negro,
or Washington, D. C., which is somewhat similar, that the need
for counsellors is higher than in a school system in some city
where you hav© a much more traditional situation, either all
whit© -“is their© a greater need for these programs when you
hav© a 79 percent Negro population?
MR. ROUMELL:
say this:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I may

I am only familiar with the record in the Detroit

situation, and I believe -that segregation is a case by case
litigation, and I believe this is th© way it developed in
Detroit.
I would say. Your Honor, that if we had 10 percent
black £:nd if th.® record showed that because of desegregation
of those children, that, it was necessary to give them remedial
programs, restoration programs, so that they can participate in
the desegregated aspects of the program, then w® would have to
hav© it. in that system.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt just a second.

We have

taken a. lot of your time so wa will extend your time by five
minutes and the same on the other side and give Justice Powell
a chance to pursue his question.

35
QUESTION;

Well, I will just ask you one more.

afraid I have interrupted you more than my share»

I am

Does it

concern you at all that a federal district judge, sleeted for
life and not responsible to the people, is engaging here in
undertaking to run a school system which, under the constitu­
tion of Michigan and every other state, is vested in-fee school
board and the state board of ©clue at ion?
MR. RGUMELL%
here.

Your Honor, that is not what happened

Here is what happened here:

This federal judge, like

any other judge in any other type of case, heard the evidence,
and you had the Board of Education coming in and saying, we as
trained educators are telling you that we cannot desegregate
Detroit in this situation unless we have these components.

We

have the state defendants coming in and saying, we agree on
three of them? we have the state- defendants coming in and say­
ing, we are submitting a joint report on tasting.

We agreed.

Everybody says to the poor little judge, here it is, and then
we have the expert from the plaintiffs, two men who have spent
their lives, their professional life, desegregating, said, yes,
Your Honor, in order to overcome the obstacles of desegregation
you must have these educational components.
Now, Mr. Justice Powell, this is what happened:

This

did not come from the mind of Judge DeMascio, he had not thought
of it.

It came from the minds of every person that was in that

court room, every report.

He has no contrary evidence.

It is

no different than a psychiatrist in an accident case saying,

&

result of this accident and

It is the same principle that happened

her© in the Detroit case.
QUESTIONS
one more question.

May I go back on my own word and ask you
If these same witnesses present the same

testimony before the Board of Education in the City of
Detroit, and if so what was the board’s response, what did it
say in its role as the elected representatives of the people
to provide a quality education for the City of Detroit?
MR. RGUMELL:

Your Honor, I take issue with the ques­

tion of quality education.

I call this restoration.

Your

Honor, w© are not teaching French cooking and home economics
or literature, w® are restoring children, and we ara trying to
over corae the obstacles to segregation.
Here is what happened.;

Whan the cas® was remanded,

the Detroit Board utilizing a number of people, including an
expert from the University of Michigan, an expert from Michigan
State, an expert from Wayne State University, developed a plan
and it was the unanimous view of fch© Detroit Board that they
should present to the District Court as part of th® plan of de­
segregation as

another tool, just as much as zoning and busing,

as another? tool to desegregate Detroit, to make it work now.
And that is what we are talking about her©, Your Honor, and
that is what the Detroit. Board did, and it 'was voted on and th©

37
vota was unanimous.
QUESTION;
Attorney Genera},.

Let me go back to a question I put to the
I put to him the question, if there ’ware a

finding by the District Court that the 3.anguage difficulties of

these Negro students was way below par, that is both in speech
and in reading, and a finding was made to that effect specifically, and the further finding that it was necessary to engage
in these remedial components in order to balance that out, I
thought ha said, yes,

if there had been such a finding, that

would ba a different case from the one here.

And then I put

to him the question, is not th® approval by the District Court
of the plan submitted by the Board of Education, not conceived
by the district judge but by the Board of Education, is not his
approval the equivalent of a finding on that score, and I think
he took issue there and said, no, he did not think that was
specific enough.

What, would you have to say about, that?

MR. RQUMELL;
finding.

Five words, Ycur Honor, it was the

And may I respectfully say to th® Chief Justice and

th© Court, pages 18 through 34 of our brief set forth those
specific findings.

Arid may I point out to th© Court that after

we made our presentation, the judge said go back, work with the
state and whittle it down.

And this thing had been refined, it

had gore through a very refined position, with the state par­
ticipating, and if they didn't like it they could have filed
motions, they could h^~e brought it to the attention of the

38
court.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Roumell, isn’t the real dispute

here not between the School Board and the District Court, you
are really aligned with the District Court, it is between the
School Board and th® District Court on the one hand and the
state on the other, not over the nature of the remedy so much
as the fact that the District Court has ordered the stata to pay
unappropriated funds that it might not have chosen to pay
Detroit for it.
MR. ROUMELL:

Well, th© District Court didn’t order

the state to pay unappropriated funds.

What they ordered the

state, as one of the joint two wrongdoers, they were a wrong­
doer, to put

these programs into effect, n d they didn’t

give a blank check.

The only order that is before this Court

is the order to do that, and the representation by ‘the Detroit
board, undisputed by the state defendants, that it would cost
$11.6 million, and the state was asked to pay less than $25 per
child.

Now, frankly, if the. stats wanted to do th® evaluation

of the tests, if they wanted to sand in th© remedial teachers,
if they wanted to send in the counselling help that we needed
and put oa the in-service training, they would have been welcome
to do it, but they didn’t choose to do -that.

They ware only

ordered, just like this Court has ordered states to prepare
transcripts for indigents in criminal matters, that is all they
were ordered to do.

This is net a money judgment.

And they are

39
wrongdoers
QUESTION;

You say it is not the equivalent of a

money order, an order to pay money?
MR. ROUMELL:

Absolutely not, nobody was ordered to

pay ©very child $200 because of these violations.
QUESTION;

How about an order to pay the Detroit

School Board a certain amount of money in order to assist it in
implementing this program?

MR. ROUMELL;

Well, he had another choice, they could

have just put the program in, if they wanted to, but I don’t
call that a money judgment.

It is no different than ordering

a state to provide an indigent defendant a transcript or legal
counsel.

There is no difference.

Nobody has usurped th© authority of the state

40
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHANIEL R. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BRADLEY
MR. JONES;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The respondents, Ronald Bradley, urge that the judg™
ment of th® Court, of Appeals be affirmed.

Before setting for'fch

the reasons for urging that affirmance, I should like to disposes
of two assertions that have been repeated in the briefs and in
argument here by th© state petitioners.
First, that the Detroit school system is now unitary^
and, second, that th® respondents have been and are opposed to
educational adjuncts as part of an education plan.
Let in®, first observe that th® Detroit school system
is not unitary.

Th© Sixth Circuit reversed in part and remand ad

the pupil reassignment portion of th© opinion insofar as it
left untouched three regions in tha Detroit school system that
contained over 100 schools -that were all black.

Tha Sixth

Circuit, said this situation is intolerable, they recognized th®
difficulty of the problem, but the District Court would hav® to
deal with this problem and could not leave those schools with
these 100 black schools with their students located in th©
heart of the section of Detroit which represented the very
essence of the violation to go untouched.
Secondly, it totally misrepresents the respondents8
position, to assert that respondents hav© been opposed to these

41
educational adjuncts.

It is necessary to I think understand

th© dynamics of the remand proceedings to hav© a correct under™
standing as to what took place.
The District. Court had a preoccupation with th® cart
rather than th© hors®.

There was undue attention we felt at

that time being placed upon the educational adjuncts and an
ignoring of the primary element of a remedy which was desegre­
gation.

These are adjuncts, not the primary elements of relief

and we had to continue to refocus the court's attention and the
attention of all the parties on th® fact that this was a Brown
violation, and the essential remedy had to b© pupil reassign­
ment, elimination of th© discrimination, the segregations and
secondly, as an ancillary matter, we had to deal with curing
th® effects, the lingering effects of that primary discrimina­
tion, the primary segregation, and th© state petitioners take
one line out of a cross-examination response of on© of our
experts, Dr. Foster, and ©seaHate that to our primary position
and I think it is necessary for us to set that record straight.
It would foe preposterous, it would be ludicrous, it
would be absurd, hypocritical and a reflection of the continued
concern we have had for the evils of segregation that was
addressed in Brown for the respondents to ha challenging th©
inclusion of educational components in a desegregation plan.
Gar concern was in seeing that the cart followed the
hors®.

42
QUESTIONi

Mr. Jones, hav© other courts, in devising

a remedy for an unconstitutionally segregated public school
system, have other courts included in the remedy these educa­
tional adjuncts?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;
This is not unique.

Yes.
Or: is this case unique?
This is not unique, Mr. Justice Stewart.
This is don© all the time.

In fact,

HEW, as a part of its desegregation thrust, authorizes and puts
in place educational components.

Congress, through its legis­

lative enactments, has recognized as national policy the im­
portance of including educational adjuncts as a part of a de­
segregation plan for the purpose of overcoming the intangible
and the enormous effects of the evils of segregation.

So there

is nothing unique about this.
QUESTION;

Has HEW not furnished

sot©

expert assis­

tance and equipment in th© remedial speech area and remedial

reading, both',' in seme of these cases?

Not necessarily in

this one, but in soma cases?
MR. JONES;

Not in this one, but when called upon

they have done it, when applications are made, HEW has
responded.

There are a number of instances —

MR. JONES:
QUESTIONS

NO.
Haves there been many in which have required

educational components?
MR. JONES;

Well, educational components ar© generally

found to ba necessary.
QUESTION:

Well, can you cite m® some cases, because

I haven't b@sn familiar with this until this case?
MR. JONES:

Yes, I think in th© State of Michigan, in

the Kalamazoo case, educational components were mad® a part.
Swam included educational components as a part of the remedy,
and this Court expressly approved it.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Wa affirmed it?
That is correct.
And the order had these very components

that ar© involved here?

44
MR. JONES:
QUESTIONS
MR. JONESs

That is correct:.
Am w® affirmed it?
That is correct.

And I think, Your

Honor, I would like to call your attention to the brief filed
by th© Justice Department, by the Solicitor General, at page
both at page 18 and th© bottom paragraph, in which th®
government recognises that racial discrimination in th© operation of schools often has a pervasiva effect on the education­
al process and on th® hearts and minds of students.

And it goes

on to note that the remedial decree should seek to alleviate
th®s© intangible effects, no less than to alleviate th® assign­
ment of students to racially identifiable schools.
Now, on page 20 of th© government's brief, th® first
paragraph, the Solicitor General puts his finger on th® nub of
th® problem here, the

problem th® State of Michigan has, and

‘that is: th® confusion which it has between goals and tools, and
certainly as th® government contends, that an approach, the
approach they, suggest would unduly constrict th© flexibility of
a court, charged with creating a decree that would eliminat®
all of the effects of racial discrimination, and it goes on to
note that Congress has provided in 20 U.S.C. 1703, that no
state may deny equal educational opportunity by failing to take
affirmative steps to remove th© vestages of discrimination.
And petitioners would deny district courts th® tools needed to
achieve that goal.

45
QUESTION:

What if th© District Court her® had

declined to require th© state to pay any money towards them,

MR. JONES:

I can't speak for th© school board and

The plaintiffs would have continued to insist, as you

earlier mentioned., that the adjunct programs weren't th®
essential of the decree if to© pupil reassignment itself wasn't

MR. JONES:

Well, the plaintiffs would have continued

to insist that somebody, some agency of th® state address these
secondary problems that are a part of bringing about th©
creation of th© unitary system.

In fact, we learn as w© grow,

and on© of the lessons that has bean learned through 23 years
of litigation and efforts to desegregate school systems is that
there are certain problems in connection with creating a unitary
system that have to h® faced, and —
QUESTION,?

Mr. Jones, may I interrupt you for just a

46
minute.
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
la lias with th® question Mr. Justice

Rehaquisfc was asking, I am looking at the appendix as filed to
th© opinion of tbs Court of Appeals, page 189a.

This appendix

states that fch© financial impact ©f these orders, the orders
of th© District Court, could easily destroy th® educational
program of th® Detroit school system.

The financing of tbas©

components of th® Detroit school system would only mean a concomitant elimination of existing programs.
Now, as I understand it, that came from a brief ©ild
by the Board of Education in Detroit.

That suggests to me

that th© city board bad lx? have state assistance.

If you

hadn't had state assistance, this suggests that your program
would hav© been destroyed.
MR. JONES;

What is your comment about that?

Well, Your Honor, the concern of the

plaintiffs —
QUESTION;

Is th© plaintiffs the school board or —

MR. JONES;

No, the school board is th© defendant.

QUESTION;

Yes, but this is a quotation, as I under­

stand it, from the school hoard brief before the Court of
Appeals.
MR. JONES;

Well, I am hardly th® on® to comment on

th© brief of my adversary.
QUESTION;

Oh, yes.

Well,

I will ask you this;

If

47
your adversary was correct in saying that the court order added
all of these ingredients in the educational program in Detroit
would destroy the school system unless the state cam© t© the
relief, do you think the District Court has that power?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION :

Well, I cannot accept the premise —
So you don't think the system would have

been destroyed?
MR. JONES:

No, I do not.

I would not accept that premise.

Wolf is cried often, and

But I think the court clearly

has the power under —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:
system.

Tli© power to destroy the school system?
No, not the power to destroy the school

The court clearly had the power under Ex Part© Yeung

to issue an injunction, to require agents, an agency of the
state and. state officials, to conform their future behavior,
their future conduct to conform and comply with th© commands ©£
the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Even if that requires funds totally beyond

tha means of either the city or state to provide?
MR. JONES:

Well, I can't accept that assumption.

I

think Griffin v. Prince George's County speaks to that question,
QUESTION:

I am not talking about desegregation.

am talking about determining the content, of the educational
program of a school system that is supported by money raised
from taxpayers.

MR. JOWESi

Your Honor, the court was nos determin­

ing the program of the Detroit school system.

Th© court was

faced with the problem of how do I bring about a conversion of
an unconstitutional school system into one that is constitu­
tional.

He invited the parties to submit plans.

Plans were

submitted by both the state, by the Detroit board and the
plaintiffs.

The state participated in that process and they

reached the conclusion, and the court adopted and included into
an overall plan prepared by th© court what in his judgment,
based upon record evidence, was necessary to accomplish the
legitimising of that unconstitutional school system, and that
is what w© are concerned with, what th© power of th© court was.
And I submit that th© court had that power»
QUESTION:

Referring to that appendix that Justice

Powell has just read from, teat, is attached to th© opinion ©f
th© Sixth Circuit.

Th© authorship of th© appendix at least

doesn't appear — is that somethlag written by th© court, by
the Sixth Circuit or —
MR. JONES:

The Detroit Board, I am informed, Mr.

Chief Justice, wrote that.
QUESTION:

That was submitted by th© Detroit Board to

th© Sixth Circuit?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Th© Sixth Circuit at least adopted it to

th® extent of attaching it as an appendix to tea opinion — is

49
it attached as an appendix to the opinion or is it —
MR. JONES s
Honor.

I can't explain the Sixth Circuit, Your

I don't know.
QUESTION:

Was it there when th© opinion came down,

sine® you were in th© case?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Y@s, it was.
At th© top of page 180a, Mr. Chief Justica,

that will perhaps answer your question.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, they do mak© reference to it.

I

just wanted to be sure of the authorship ©f it, because it
seamed to be hanging somewhat in midair in this form.

That

does explain it at the top ©£ 180a.
MR. JONES:

Very well.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK J. KELLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. KELLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we will

waive any rebuttal and thank th© Justices.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Any more questions?

Th© only thing I would like to ask ycu, Mr,,

Attorney General, I notice that the government, at page 21 of
its brief, takes issue with a statement of yours.

They suggest

in there, footnote 8, that you err in asserting that th®
Charlotte-Mecklsnburg decree was limited to student assignments,
and they cite 318 F Supp. 302 for the sentence, "la Swann

50
itself the district court's order included a requirement of
in-service training of teachers and the creation of a bi-racial
advisory committee to help the school system begin the process
of desegregation,"
You are with the government , right?
MR, KELLEYs
QUESTION;

MR. KELLEY;
vantage.

Right.
I !v© got the Federal Supp of 802 before me.,
Well, you have m© at a slight disad­

We believe that for the purpose or this case we will

rely on our brief.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you a question related to my

Brother- Brennan's, and' that is, in the Swann-Char lotto cases,
was the state of North Carolina ordered to pay any money to pay
for those facilities, so far as you know?
t

MR. KELLEY;

I know as a matter of fact that they

were not ordered to pay any money.
QUESTION;

And was the propriety of the remedy beyond

student assignment, an issue here, in Swann-Mscklanburg?
|

MR. KELLEY;

There was no mention ©f anything, as I

recall reading and memorizing 'that matter, beyond pupil reassign
ment.
QUESTION;
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

This sort of thing is not noveil, is it?
Well —
The tools that w® are talking about, there

are four things and they are not novel in desegregation?

51
MR. KELLEY;

Certainly not.

Michigan has pioneered

many of them and we do them and ws like to do them but we would
like to do them within our constitution and within the frame­
work of the legislature and not have the lower court sit in a
position of a school board whan it is beyond the violation.
QUESTIOH;

It is too late to help you with the answer

to that question that was put to youbut. once I was asked by
Justice Black a similar question when I said sometimes assistant
attorney generals argue cases but they don't always prepare all
of the papers themselves.
MR. KELLEY;

Well.; you can always learn/ and I thank

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The

case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2; 46 o'clock p.m., the above-entitled
case was submitted.]
