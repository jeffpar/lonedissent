MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 75-1707, Ohio Bureau of Employment
Services against Ilodory.
Mr. Szilagyi, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORMj ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SZILAGYI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MR. SZILAGYI;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This

c ase involves the constitutionality of

Section 4141.29(D)(1)(a) of the Ohio Revised Code.
This Section disqualifies individuals from
receiving unemployment benefits that is unemployment due to
a labor dispute other than a lockout at any factory, establish­
ment or other premises, located in this or any other state,
that is wholly owned or operated by the employer from which the
employee is or was last employed.
This is commonly referred to in the unemployment
field as the functional integrated plant theory whereas you
have multiple plants, one employer, and all the plants operate
as a single unit to produce one single product or end product.
Plaintiff-appallees represent approximately 1,250
steelworkers who became unemployed as a result of a strike at
the wholly owned and operated coal mines of the steel companies
which cut off the supply of coal that the steel companies needed

Plaintiffs were denied benefits by the Administrator
because of our disqualification in our law.
pending before

There's an appeal

the Board of Review in the Ohio Bureau of

Employment Services with appellees and their class, and this
is pending the outcome of this case.
During the pendancy of the appeal before the Board
the appellees filed an action in the federal District Court,
northern District, Eastern Division, in Cleveland, as a class
action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for a declaratory judgment seeking
the unconstitutionality of the statute, and also injunctive
relief in the way of past judgments.
QUESTIONs

Was the

administrative proceeding pending

at the time the case was first brought in the District Court?
MR. S2ILA.GYI:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, it was, yes.

Appellees allege that the Ohio statute was uncon­
stitutional on its face and as applied, because it violated the
supremacy clause being in conflict with 42 U.S.C. Section 503
{a)(1) and 303 (a)(1) of the Social Security Act.
Additionally, they allege that it was a violation
of due process and equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Appellees did not narae either "U.S. Steel or Republic
Steel in the District Court as the party defendants as required
under the Ohio statutes as an interested party, since their

5

funds are drawn against •— if there's payments of unemployment
benefits.
Defendants in the court below argued that the case
was not a proper case for a Three Judge District Court, and
action for injunction damages.

During oral argument appellees

changed it from money damages , and, said that it was benefits.
Plaintiff-appellees failed to exhaust their remedies
at law.

We argue that the plaintiff and his co-worker had'a

Plaintiff-appellees failed to meet the requirements
of federal rules of civil procedure 23(b)(3).

shall

And we argue that the U.S. District Court

abstaift from the hearing of. the case for two reasons; can­

ity, and that they already ware in the state administrative
process and could go up through the process to the state
courts to the federal courts in the normal

judicial manner.

The judicial court convened a three judge panel
to determine the constitutionality of the statute,

The

memorandum opinion or order of the three judge court, which
is found in the jurisdiction statement of ours on page 48,

held that injunctive relief was proper under 2B U.S.C. 2283,
the anti-injunction statute.

They said that absention was

not proper in the instant case since plaintiff had stated
a good cause under 42 U.S.C. 1983.
The Ohio courts had previously ruled on the validity
of this statute.

Therefore, it \-70uld be futile for the

plaintiffs to go through the process again.
The court found in the prerequisites to certifi­
cations -- that the prerequisites of certification had been
met under 23(a) and (b), despite, as I said, that no fact
of notice was given.

And they said that the operative effect

of 4141.29(D)(1) which disqualifies benefits to plaintiffs
violates the equal protection and due process clauses
guaranteed tinder the Fourteenth Amendment, and 42 U.R.C.
1983.
We generally argued in oral argument that granting
of benefits to v?orkers laid off due to a strike, in a
parent company's subsidiary plant, would in effect be
subsidizing the union members of the steel workers.
Granting of benefits would place the employer at an
unfair disadvantage in negotiations with the unions.

If the

financial burden of supporting the striking members is shifted
from the union's treasury to the State of Ohio, it is
conceivable that no concerted effort by the mine workers to
negotiate

.a fair settlement would be pursued until the

7
employer reached a financial crisis.
The difference between the mine workers of, say,
a hundred and maybe five or six thousand steel workers,
you can see the impact upon the employer's fund.
The State has a legitimate purpose in protecting
the fiscal integrity of its compensation fund.

Strikes

involving large corporations such as U.S. Steel, the Auto
Workers, and other corporate giants, involve many .hxmdreds
and thousands of employees which would sometimes last many
weeks, further depleting our fund.
QUESTION:

Is it clear that the statute in this

case does prevent any unemployment benefits to be paid to
’the respondents?
MR. S7IILAGYI:

Mr. Justice, the statute, when this

case was brought up, did disqualify benefits if it xvas a
wholly owned and operated subsidiary that went on strike
that caused the main plant to strike.
In this instant case there were about two thousand
186

employees involved, in

The Board of Review,- in half of the cases, found
that the employees in the

And therefore — or lack of

people did get

benefits, which is on appeal by the Steel Company, of course.
QUESTION:

Rut then the claim of these people is

also on appeal by them?
MR. SZILAGYI: That is correct, in administrative
process.
QUESTION:

So it is not clear so far — it hasn’t

been finally determined by the State of Ohio —
MR. SZILAGYI:
QUESTION;

That is correct, that is correct.

— in the administrative appeal process

if these people are deprived of their unemployment benefits,
isn't that correct?
MR. SZILAGYI:

The final determination hasn’t been

made.
QUESTION:

And their claim in that appeal is what?

That —
MR. SZILAGYI;

That they are entitled to it since

they were involuntarily unemployed.

Which is

counter to the

statute.
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but do they say they're

entitled to it even under the statute?
MR. SZILAGYI:

Will,

they say that the statute is

MR. SZILAGYI:

I would settle for a reverse —

QUESTION:

Well, would you agree to their remand?

You woudn't agree to that?
MR. SZILAGYI:

Mr. Justice, I don't think the

remand would be very good, because the district court would
still have to wait for the administrative hearings.

Where does this case dome from?

MR. SZILAGYX:

This one comes from directly to the

district court, which convened a three judge court

for the

constitutionality.
QUESTION:

Now, was the conflict with the federal

statute alleged there?
MR. SZILAGYX:

There isn't — yes, they had a — they

said it was in conflict with Section 503 —
QUESTION:

Did the three judge court decide that?

MR. SZILAGYX:

Well, they didn't say if was in con­

flict with the federal statute.

Because Judge Celebrezee

requested to the appellees in the brief — in fact it's in
my brief — where he specifically questioned appellees and
said, is there any federal law that you can tell me that's
in conflict with this?

And the appellees said, no, they did

not have any federal law.

MR, SZILAGYI:

I don’t think the court spoke to

said it was a due process violation.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn’t it supposed to before it

reached the equal protection or due process clause?
MR. SZILAGYI:

Well, I understood that — from the

lower court, they just said there was a constitutional
conflict on equal protection and due process.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but how 'about

a conflict of the federal statute?
MR. SZILAGYI:
I know.

They didn’t decide that?

They didn’t decide that as far as

QUESTION:

Do you object to that or not?

Are you

complaining about that or not?
MR. SZILAGYI:

I am complaining — yes, it's part of

our brief, that there isn't any federal statute.

And unless

you have a federal right or constitutional right, fundamental
right, a 1983 action isn't proper.
QUESTION:

Well, you can raise the issue of

conflict of the federal statute in a 1983 action.
MR. S2ILAGYI:

Btit there has to exist a fundamental

right or statutory right, which there isn't in this case.
QUESTION s

You say there *s just no federal statute

that5 s relevant to it?
MR. SZILAGYI:

1935 under Steward, the tv;o landmark cases that this Court
decided was Charles C. Steward v. Davis and the Carmichael

But there are approximately 31 now or more.

And this energy crisis has even caused more of a problem,
because Ohio's funds are going to run out probably •— or were
going to, if the weather hadn't turned, by March 15th.
QUESTION:

Well, has Ohio amended its law now?

MR. SZTLAGYIs

Yes, it has amended its law.

there is still a disqualification.

MR. SZILAGYX;

QUESTION:

But how did they — did they eliminate

the disqualification?
MR. S7.Ii.AGYI;
disqualification.

They eliminated part of the

But there's still a disqualification.

The elimination was, as in this case ■— the language of the
statute said that, no individual shall be disqualified —
well, this is the language that is of particular interest
in this case — or other premises located in this or any
other state, and owned or operated by the employer, by which
he was or is last employed.
Now, that language was taken out.

So that the

location of out of state or away from the premises would be

QUESTION:

So that the employees involved in this

case would have been ■— would not have been disqualified?
MR. SZILAGYI:

Well, that’s the point that hasn't

been litigated in the state, and I'll tell you why, Mr.
Justice.

The statute

of it was still the same.

the part that was amended, the rest
And it still has a disqualification.

It says that no individual shall be disqualified from
benefits unless his employer is a wholly owned subsidiary
of the employer engaged in the dispute.
So they ta^ke it out and it's still in, in another
placa, in a different context.

So there's still possibly

disqualification for involuntary unemployed due to a labor
disputa, which hasn't been litigated yet.

That's correct, yes.

MR, SZILAGYI;

Yesf it's part of our jurisdictional

statement as an exhibit, which was signed by the Secretary
of Labor.
Appellants contend there’s no federal right to
unemployment compensatione and the appellees have not demon­
strated such a right exists.
Appellees have argued that the Ohio labor dispute
disqualification as it.appeared in' *74-’75 deprived them of
due process.
In order to have a constitutionally secured or

18

protected right, you have to have a federal statute or at
least a fundamental right before you reach the due process
argument.
390

There isn't any in this case.
In Paul v„ Davis and R'.e 11 ey y „ John son last year

decided by this Court, the Court recognised that due process
does not extend to every perceived inequality suffered at
the hands of the state, but rather applies only where there
is involved an underlying federal or constitutional right.
The due process arguments made by appellee can
be deemed viable if they can point out some — some law that
would contravene the Ohio state law.

Section 503(a) of the

Social Security Act, the first section requires approval by
the Secretary of Labor, the second section speaks about
when due that this Court had when they faced Java — nothing
to do with unemployment benefit eligibility.,

Section 303

states that payments will be made to the state upon approval
by the Secretary of labor of our plan.
There6s nowhere that we've been able to find, or as
far as we've concerned, that the appellees have been able to
find, that applies to eligibility for benefits.

There are

many disqualifications in the unemployment field.

There's *—

you're disqualified in some states for benefits if you have to
-go to a jury.

You're disqualified if you're ill.

You're

I

disqualified, if you're pregnant within the time frame with
limitations.

You're disqualified if you have to leave your

IS
job to follow your husband or wife to another state.
So there are many types of disqualifications.

You

have to first qualify for 26 weeks eligibility of work in most
states.

You have a one week disqualification.

You've got

strike disqualifications? labor dispute disqualifications.
Some cases have held that lack of transportation, you're
disqualified.

It's not up to the employer to furnish it.

So there are all kinds of disqualifications
QUESTIONS

And every state has a cut off time,

you're qualified only for a certain number of weeks?
MR. SZILAGYI:
weeks in most cases.

That is correct, your Honor? 26

But the time for qualification varies,

the monetary amount varies, the earned amount to qualify
varies.

There are fifty states with fifty different variables.
QUESTION s

But every single state has a -—

MR. SZILAGYI:

— duration.

MR. SZILAGYI:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Or limitation.

MR. SZILAGYI:

Except where the federal government

came in under the emergency with high unemployment a couple
of years ago, and they appropriated the money from, apparently,
general revenue to make the extended benefits.

It wasn't

state unemployment funds.
QUESTION:

MR, SZILAGYI:

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, SZILAGYI:

But that’s cut off now because of

the on-off indicator that they have.

If it reaches a certain

percent in the state in high economic unemployment areas , it
goes back on,

Ohio so far

QUESTION:

has not been back on it,

In any event even that, there’s a

terminal point at 65 weeks,
MR, SZILAGYI:

Yes,

But that's an unusual case.

Twenty six weeks is the normal.
Under the Tenth Amendment, our argument is that
since the Social Security Act does not decide what benefits
are to be paid — it’s left to the state — that any law
that would tell us what to do that would be reserved to the
states under their reserved power, police power and general
welfare, would be a violation of the Tenth Amendment,
The coverage -- there have been two amendments to
the

Social Security Act,

The 1970 amendments increased the

coverage, but nothing was said about benefits.

It was just

that state and political subdivision employees would be
covered? certain types of agriculture workers are now not
excluded, unless they’re actually on the farm, but their
adjacent, peripheral type of work is covered,

We question whether

since the state

employees and the political subdivisions are exempt from
FUTA.

So therefore the state gives no credit for that.
And I -would expect that this Court might be faced

with that challenge one of these days.
QUESTION s

Could you tell me if the federal officials

have specifically address themselves to whether to not the
Ohio type of disqualification

is contrary to the federal

statute or to federal regulations?
MR. S2XLAGYIs

Yes, sir, your Honor.

We've got about, three areas in that.

A recent case

that this Court heard, which they denied cert in was Kimball.
In the Kimbell case, I believe this Court asked the Solicitor
General to file a position paper, a law memorandum paper,

MR, S2ILAGYI:

The issue in that case involved a

labor dispute? but it’s not the same as ours.

But I'm

pointing it out because the Solicitor General says? it's
always been, and still is, a right of a state to determine
who is eligible, to what extent benefits are paid, and what
disqualifications you’re going to nave.
QUESTIO??:

But is that as close as you can come to

finding something addressed to this specific kind of a

Previous to that they

meant establishment covered multi-plants.
The Michigan case in Chrysler that was just decided
previous to that held that they would go to a strict con­

And they also had the sane

problem because Ford had multi-integrated plants to produce
an automobile.

And the Michigan court, supreme court, that

establishment was not broad enough to cover another plant.

Mr. Lordeon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PATRICK LORDEON, EEQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE.
MR. LORDEON:

Good morning, Mr. Justice Burger.

Good morning, Mr. Justices, Mr. Bsilagyi, co-counsel, fellow
citizens:
Briefly stated, we think this Ohio statute negates
the whole purpose of the Federal Unemployment Compensation
Act founded in 1936 at a time when I was just toddling around

26

and most of you gentlemen understand better»

And I ask you

to try to recall back —- what it was like back in the 30’s
and remember why that statute —- you as members of the jury
can do that» You don't have to forget your common sense as
we say to jurors, and with all due deference and respect.
This case —• Mr. Szilagyi is talking about and the
State has talked about administrative procedure, administrative
expertise comes through in the presentation,

I would also

point out to this Court that the members of the lower Three
Judge Court, particularly the Honorable Judge Celebresee,
was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Ohio,
Bureau of Employment Services, before his elevation to HEW
where he became the Secretary of HEW in the Kennedy
Administration,

And he was in a position to be knowledgeable

of these statutes to be administering for the whole United
States, not just Ohio.

He was the man who decided this case.

We have judicial expertise here.

Judge Thomas Lambros was a

common pleas judge before he was elevated to the bench and
decided many unemployment cases, and that appears in the record.
And the Court knows this through its administration of those
judges and those courts.

These are matters which you can

take judicial notice of if you like.
Briefly, we would like to point out that are few
what we would call inaccuracies in the statements of fact.
The State asserts that the Ohio statute as passed in '3S is

27
essentially the same as the Ohio amendment which we are
attacking in 1961.
14 years.

And it lived until 1975, a period of

It is not essentially the same.
Prior to 1961 had Mr. Hodory and his group applied,,

they would have received benefits.

In 1961 there was — or

1963 , excuse me, there was no other — there was only one other
state than Ohio that excluded under these circumstances, and
that was North Carolina which passed this severe exclusion in
1961.

Up to that point, all of the states were — would have

allowed benefits at this point.
Furthermore, the State relies upon a case in support
of a proposition of law that Michigan statutes are somewhat
like Ohio statutes, and characterizes that as a the law of
Michigan.
We, we point out as we do at page 57 of the brief,
Chrysler versus Smith, 297 Michigan page 430, was expressly
overruled in Park v. Appeal. Board of Michigan, 355 Michigan
103.

And that appeal appears in our brief.

And that case is

not good law for anything.

statute upon which you rely?
MR. LORDEON:

And what provision of the federal statutory

And that uses the word, proper.

MR. L0RDEON:

Proper, right.

And we're saying this

is not proper.
QUESTION;

Although the Secretary of Labor has found

that it is.
MR.LORDEON:

Right.

And he also found that in the

Turner case.
What we're saying is, the Java

case, as we told the

lower court and as we argued, did not primarily or specifically
deal with procedure versus substantive.

This Court wasn't

talking about the standards to get locked in on these
categories, as Mr. Marshall points out in Murgia v. Massachu­
setts where we have a two tier approach for equal protection
classifications.

We feel that this Court was speaking out

for the purpose, the fundamental purpose, of the Unemployment
Act, when Chief Burger said that those involuntarily unemployed.
Well, Chief Justice Burger, in delivering the opinion of the
Court in Java

clearly indicated that the purpose of Congress

in enacting the unemployment compensation program was to
provide a substitute for wages lost during a period of unem­
ployment not the fault of the employee, 402 U.S„ 130.
And in this case, wa are saying that the Ohio
disqualification bears no relationship to any legitimate

It has no rationale behind it.

Therefore,

And if must fail on constitutional grounds,

and it must fail because it. is in conflict with the fundamental
purpose of the Congressional statute as passed by Congress in.
Title 26 -QUESTION:

Mr, Lordeon, in your constitutional

argument in which you rely on the equal protection clause,
what are the classifications that you say the statute makes
that are improper?
MR. LORDEON:

Well, number one, your Honor, the

statute denies benefits to people who are generally — the
statute starts out in Ohio — what we?re talking about is at
page 26 in the appendix, O.R.C. 4141,29, Eligibility and
qualification, for benefits.
It says, each eligible individual shall receive
benefits

It appears in the customs and traditions of the

QUESTION:

Well, is your classification, then,

34
between those involuntarily unemployed and those not
involuntarily unemployed?
MR. LORDEON;
QUESTION %

Is that what you8re saying?

Yes, that would be the broad class.

Well, what do you do about a case

involving only one plant in which, say, the people who run
the heating, the boiler plant, or something like that, go on
strike and everybody else has to stay home?

Could the State

deny unemployment compensation working in the same plant where
the strike occurred, but who had no control over the inability
to work?
MR. LORDEON;

Your Honor, we treat that in our

brief, and briefly stated, we're not dealing with that, but
to be answering your question quite properly and politely,
we would indicated that no benefits for strikers — we're
in agreement with that.

We feel that striking is involuntary

We feel that funda­

the lino that says, thou shalfc not step

across, this can be gotten into at the preliminary stage.
As a matter of fact, 20 years ago I worked at U.S.
Steel as a foreman there.

And when we terminated people —

and they still do today — they were given a little card, they
handed in their materials, they handed in their equipment,
they were checked out.

The reason for their discharge was

put on a multicopied tear apart that gave the reason
there why they were being discharged.

right

And most of the time

it was terminated for lack of work, reduction of force.

So

there's no burden on the state.
And the employee takes this to the state offices.

36
And they rely on that.

And it’s a business record.

And so it's really not a evidentiary problem as
the state puts forth.
QUESTION 5

Going back to what you told my brother

Stevens was your basic equal protection claim, i.e. the
distinction between voluntarily unemployed and involuntarily
unemployed,, every state statute is shot full of provisions that
deny to involuntarily unemployed people unemployment compen­
sation ,

For example f everybody after his 26 weeks runs out,

or whatever the -number of weeks is, who remains involuntarily
unemployed, no longer gets unemployment benefits, just to
take one example.
Everybody -- there’s a waiting period in every state,
isn't there?
MR. LORDEON:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

And during that period he's involuntarily

unemployed, and doesn’t get benefits.

All of the exempt

employees, the agricultural workers, the domestic workers,
and all those people are involuntarily unemployed, and they
do not get benefits.

So that distinction just does not —

unless you say that all those provisions -- and I’ve only
mentioned a few illustrative examples — all of those
provisions are unconstitutional„
MR. LORDEON:

Well, the farm workers and the other

people that you mentioned, they are not in the eligible class.

37
QUESTION:

Well, neither are these people.

MR. LORDEONs

The steel workers ~ yes, they are

in the class.

My question is, isn’t this true in every

MR. LORDEON:

No, I’ve answered that, but — this

statute was tailored in Ohio, and they have another one —
the only State like it was North Carolina.

If this Court

rules in favor of Ohio in this case, you necessarily overrule

51 other jurisdictions,, the other states, and District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico.
QUESTION;

They have to be all wrong.

The question is whether this is

constitutionally tolerable —
MR. LORDEON:
QUESTION s

Yes.

— not whether the other states violate

the constitution by not having this same law.

The question

in this case is, is this statute constitutionally tolerable.
MR, LORDEON;
QUESTION?

We understand.

And our contention —

But you just submitted that if we decide

against you in this case, we will invalidate the laws of 49
other states.

That's certainly not true.

You don't mean

that, do you?
MR. LORDEON;

3y implication, why certainly.
\

And Ohio's new statute would be overruled.

It would

be granting benefits. QUESTIONs

Well, I just can't let you say that.

What you're, saying, Mr. Lordeon, is that those statutes would
not be constitutionally required.

But if we hold this

statute is permissible, it has no effect whatsoever on those
statutes.

The legislature can still have the statute it now

has.
MR. LORDEONs

Oh, yes it would.

Because Ohio --

basically this Ohio amendment is anti-labor legislation.
can’t be interpreted as any other way.

It

QUESTION:

But are you suggesting that anything that

we hold the constitution permits will be adopted because Ohio
is basically anti-labor and all its policies are anti-labor,,
.is that what you’re saying?
MR. LORDEON:
advisedly.

And I use the word, anti-labor,

It's just a short hand expression.
Yes, and you can see it in this case.

You'll

and a lot of other cases.
QUESTION:

The'AFL-CIO filed a brief and didn't

agree with you either?
MR. LORDEON:

Ho, because I think —- the question

underlying the surface here is whether or not benefits should
be paid to strikers.

And that case is —- the Drassenower

case which is waiting petition for cert in this Court right
now.

And that is not our case.

We are not dealing with

42
And there's lobbying going on in the country in
the various legislatures, and in this case there is lobbying.
And the issue that comes in here by way of the back door is
really brought in by the employers and the Chamber of Commerce
and the AFL-CIO, because what they are talking about is the
payment of unemployment benefits to strikers by state
unemployment compensation funds.
And in New York, where the Drassenower case — which
is awaiting some activity by this Court, involves a situation
where the New York statute allows benefits to strikers who
are directly participating in the strike at the site after
a seven week waiting period.
And the CIO is pushing for Drassenower all over
the United States without fault.

And the Chamber of Commerce

and the steel companies are saying, we don't want to have to
pay benefits for people who are striking us directly because,
number one, it violates neutrality.

We don't want to have

to pay the benefits of people who are striking against us.
And they're directly involved in that.

that this would be subsidising a labor dispute.

QUESTIOT7:

Your equal protection argument, which

is what the court decided.

Have you finished discussinq that?

Because I don't understand your position.
HR. LORDEONi

Well, in this particular case, we have

a group of employees who were denied benefits under the
statute that sets up a class of individuals who are deemed to
be disqualified from receiving henefits where their partici­
pation in a strike hasn't been shown.
The state, in this case — there's no real sub­
stantial state purpose for the passage of this statute, and it
doesn't present any legitimate interests of the state.

It

furthers no substantial interests of the state.
The arguments put forward in favor of this are, one,
that it destroys the fiscal integrity of the state.

recognized this.

Your point is, this narrow class is

We're saying •— yes, and there's no
