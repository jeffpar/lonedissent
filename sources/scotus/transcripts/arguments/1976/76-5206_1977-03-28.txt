MR,» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Rolling, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARLAND R. ROLLING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROLLING:

Mr, Chief Justice and members of the

Court, and may It please the Court:
My name is Garland Rolling.

I am here in behalf of

the Petitioner, Harry Roberts,
Harry Roberts was a young, nineteen year old black
lad who was convicted by the Criminal District Court for the
Parish of Orleans for the killing of a police officer, under
Statute RS 1430 which was a mandatory death penalty statute,
part of which has been approved in the predecessor to this
case, Stan Is la us Roberts v, ___ Louis lan a,
I find myself in a rather unique position 'of having
to call to the Court's attention the possible jurisdictional
problem on a writ that I applied for in accordance with 28 USC
(a)1237.
If it may please the Court, Harry Robert's case was
argued and submitted in the Supreme Court of Louisiana ,

The

death sentence was affirmed,,..-A rehearing was applied for, . It\
was denied ,
During the yO-day writ period, of course, the

4
Stanislaus Roberts case came down from this Court,

It was too

late to have any further hearings before the state court so we
went ahead with the writ in this particular Court.
I am concerned, if it may please the Court, that had
the Louisiana Supreme Court had the benefit of Stanislaus
Roberts at the time they decided Harry Roberts, possibly a
different result would have occurred.
Stanislaus Roberts, as you know, struck down Section
1 of the IS 1430 statute, the mandatory death penalty for the
killing during an armed robbery.
This may be merely academic, the question of the
finality of judgment, because certainly if

he Supreme Court

of the United States sends this back to the Supreme Court of
Louisiana,then the state or the individual could apply for writs
and be back up here in six months to a year, but I do want to
call it to the Court’s attention for whatever consideration
they may want to give it.
The second and more basic consideration that we are
asking the Court for on behalf of Harry Roberts are the pro­
cedural objections that we have to the matter of the caption
of the first degree murder statute in Louisiana which, of
course, has been reamended and reaffirmed since the decisions
in Proffitt v. Florida and Gregg v. Georgia and the other cases
which came down some time ago.
The statute provides, of course, for built-in

5
aggravating circumstance, the killing of a police officer.
It would have been interesting in the outcome of this case if
we could have presented the various mitigating circumstances.
One particular interesting thing about the case is the defen­
dant took the witness stand in his own behalf and he has con­
tinually and vehemently denied his guilt in this case and said
it was a case of misidentification,
There was evidence both ways.

There were numerous mitigating circumstances.

home.

The jury resolved the

He had a problematical

He had a long history of mental problems.
Possibly, if we had had an opportunity to present this}

to the jury in accordance with those standards set forth in
Gregg v, Georgia and the other cases, we would have had a dif­
ferent result here and wouldn't have had the death penalty.
The state got the benefit of the one aggravating
circumstance which was resolved against the defendant, but the
defense did not have the benefit of the many mitigating circum­
stances which we were not allowed to present.
I am concerned about the whole question of cruel and
unusual punishment, and I may take the minority view.

Quite

frankly, I personally feel that cruel and unusual punishment
by giving someone life imprisonment is far more severe than
putting someone to death in a capital case.
choice, I would much rather be put to death.

If I had the

6
I am deeply concerned about the Johnson Washington
case which has not been bound into the United States reports,
wherein my good friend, Attabury, who resides in St. Charles
Parish and who was a police officer, was shot down and killed
and his assailant was given life imprisonment by this Court'
less than six months ago, when the Court here held that the
killing of a deputy sheriff did not constitute cruel and un­
usual punishment •— X beg your pardon, the killing of a deputy
sheriff requires a life sentence and to put him to death would
be cruel and unusual punishment, and this is Just six months
ago by this Court,
The case, Washington, is cited right here in my
brief and arose — the two killings arose less than ten miles
apart in two different parishes in the same state, and it is
very difficult for me to understand, nox*j, how a few months
later Hary Roberts could be possibly jeopardized by being
executed .
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the jury system that

— very often juries on the same criminal conduct will reach
different results.

Manslaughter in one state might be murder

in another, depending on attitudes.that vary,
MR, ROLLING:
well taken.

If it please the Court, your point is

The jury can reach different results but the

Supreme Court of the United States should not reach different
results, may it please the Court,

three months apart.

One man can be put to death in March 1977 and one
man gets life in December 1976»
QUESTION:

We donrfc sit as a jury to review,

MR, ROLLING:

Yes, sir, but you sit as a Court to

tell us what the law of the land island the law of the land
for killing a deputy sheriff four months ago was life imprison­
ment,

And now we are up here today to discuss what the law

of the land will be for the death of a policeman,
I am very disturbed,

I don't have a solution to it,

I just want to present the problem to the Court for your con­
sideration,

Each of these was a mandatory death

Yes, same statute.

QUESTION:

You think we made a mistake in taking it

for the issues that are proposed here for discussion?
MR, ROLLING:

Well, I don't think we can change a

decision of this magnitude in three days, at least in three
months.

As I say, it hasn't even been bound into the legal

volumes and we are up here now, today, again talking.
When we applied for writs in this case, we expected
a perfunctory reversal of the death penalty,as did the state,
as did the legal community,

MR, ROLLING:
QUESTION:

The sentence was reversed.

What did it ask the Supreme Court of

Louisiana to do?
MR, ROLLING:

It simply said to proceed consistent

of the death penalty for killing a deputy sheriff.

To proceed not inconsistent,,

MR, ROLLING:
Yes, sir.

Right, to proceed not Inconsistent.

That is correct.
So we set the penalty aside.

Do you have it here?

MR, ROLLING:

brief.
QUESTION:

And, really, that's what you are asking

us to do here.
MR. ROLLING:

Well, It is exactly right.

I don't

see how we can turn this case on the same statute.
QUESTION:

I, for one, will be interested in your

opponent's reaction to this inquiry.
MR, ROLLING:

I would like to just call -- and this,

of course, is the crux of the argument.

Johnson Washington is

printed in all the advance sheets and the Court is much more
familiar with it than I am.

I do see the possibility of an

equal protection argument, the problem of who do we protect and
who don’t we protect.

Our particular statute we are dealing

with here today protects the deputy sheriff, the policemen

11

It protects the game warden, for example, and it provides
death if a game warden is killed but It doesn't protect me
because I am just a lax^yer,

I am not the game warden.

So what do we do with the list? Am I denied equal
protection because the game warden is protected and I am not
protected?

I, personally, feel slighted by the statute.
If it may please the Court, I may further go on to

say that there are some Witherspoon problems in the Harry
Roberts case which are not made a part of this record but which
we would like to reserve in case they require further pro­
ceedings »
Thank you, very kindly.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Rolling.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUISE KORNS, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS. KORNS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The State of Louisiana is of the respectful view that
Louisiana Revised Statues, Statute RS 1430, Paragraph 2, which
provides for the mandatory death sentence for first degree
murder or the intentional killing of a police officer in the
performance of his lawful duty -QUESTION:

I wonder if you would respond to his vieivs

about the jurisdictional issue that he has now raised,

12

MRS o KORNS:

Your Honor, the state's view about that,

as we set out in our brief, is that if he wanted more consider-»
ation in the Louisiana courts his recourse was to ask for
habeas corpus in setting aside the death sentence, then to edge
all these questions relating to Louisiana courts in the
Louisiana courts, and not to come up here and apply, for certiorari.
We feel that he has waived all of this by applying
for certiorari, and particularly after this Court issued its
narrowing order on November 28th, saying that the sole issue
before the Court on this grant of certiorari would be limited
to the constitutionality of the death penalty, the mandatory
death penalty, for the intentional killing of a police officer
under the Louisiana first degree murder law.

This Court said

it .
QUESTION:

Mrs. Korns, how do you distinguish this

from Washington v« Louisiana?
MRS, KORNS:
Blackmuh.

Distinguish it very easily, Mr, Justice

That 'was -- the Court didn't write an opinion in

that case, didn’t address itself to the issues.

It just said

the sentence was set aside as cruel and unusual, that it
couldn't be carried.
it out.

It would be cruel and unusual to carry

See Stanislaus Roberts v, Louisiana.

That's all.

The Court never addressed itself to the issues and,
frankly, you know, you wouldn't know what the case contained
unless you went back and read the application for certiorari

13

and the Supreme Court of Louisiana’s opinion.

It is an order

without — It is not even a pro curem opinion.
of this Court.

It is an order

And the State doesn't see how an order., without

reasons, can be binding — there was no oral argument on it,
no presentation of the issues.

Even when you read the appli­

cation to certiorari in Johnson Washington, it doesn't focus on
Section 2 of the statute.

It just, you know, attacks the whole

statute.
QUESTION:

Are there any differences in the cases?

MRS „ KORNS:

Factually, Your Honor, there is not,

QUESTION: So, either the Court was wrong there or it
has to change its mind.
MRS, KORNS:
QUESTION:

Right.
Will you face that way.

We can’t hear

you here.
hid you say that there is no factual distinction?
MRS. KORNS:

Justice Blackmun, there is none.

both cases, the accused killed a police officer.

In

In both

cases, he was prosecuted for first degree murder under our
Louisiana Revised Statutes 30, Section 2.
QUESTION:

My Impression, and I just wanted your

concession and you have conceded.
MRS, KORNS:

That's right.

I have conceded it.

It is identical..
However, the State of Louisiana feels that this

14

blanket order of this Court which could have been an oversight.
At least the Court was not thinking

Let's put it in the

words of ail the Gregg, and it surprised me, the Court didn't
focus on the specific issues which are presented to the Court
here, that is, the difference between the second paragraph of
Article 30 and the first paragraph under which Stanislaus
Roberts had been convicted which was a felony murder doctrine.
Therefore, the citing of Stanislaus Roberts ,war> a> dis­
missal of. “the Stanislaus Roberts —for the granting of -- for
the setting aside of the Imposition of the death penalty in
Johnson V)ashIngton just was not in point because Stalslaus
Roberts deals with the first section of Article 30, which is a
broad, sweeping felony murder statute which says that anyone
who commits a murder while engaged; in the commission of a
recited number of felonies, like armed robbery, shall be
mandatorily sentenced to death.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt with one other question?

If the Court did make a mistake in the Stanislaus,
or the Washington case, did not the State of Louisiana make
precisely the same mistake in its reponse to the petition for
certiorari?

Lid not the state also construe the first Roberts

case as covering this case?
MRS. KOHNo:

Your Honor, I wrote that application

and I didn't give any thought either to the problem of dif­
ferentiating out the two,

I just •— I think I --

15

QUESTION:

In other words, you read the prior

Roberts opinion as covering this situation?
MRS, KORNS:

I think I said that if this Court didn't

grant a rehearing in Stanislaus Roberts, the State of Louisiana
probably could not execute Harry Roberts.
in my application.

That's what I said

No doubt about it.

Then this Court granted certiorari and two weeks later
announced its order that the issue for decision in this case on
certiorari before this Court would be the constitutionality
of the mandatory death sentence, under Louisiana law, for the
intentional killing of a police officer.
Now, the State of Louisiana believes that this case
can be very easily distinguished from the Stanislaus Roberts
case.
Article 30 of the Louisiana Criminal Code before it
was amended last summer, following this Court's Gregg et al
decisions, provided that first degree murder is the killing of
a human being.
Mow the first subparagraph of that article was the
Stanislaus Roberts case, the felony murder doctrine, which this
Court through out in Stanislaus Roberts.
The second paragraph is the one under which the
present case and Johnson Washington was brought.

When the

offender has a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily
harm upon a police officer who was engaged in performance of his

16

duties.
Now, the State of Louisiana’s position is that this
Is clearly distinguishable from the Stanislaus Roberts case
because this statute is narrowly drawn, it incorporates the
statutory aggravating circumstance.
It is the State of Louisiana’s position that there
are no mitigating circumstances possible when a person in­
tentionally kills a police officer in the performance of his
lawful duty.
And fourth, we feel that because of the trial judge’s
very careful instructions to the jury in this case in plain,
every day language, the responsive verdicts did not give the
jury unfettered discretion, and that no appellate review was
necessary on the narrower issue of jury capriciousness, and so
forth, by the Louisiana Supreme Court, because of the narrower
statute that was presented to the jury.
In other words, to bring in a verdict of guilty in
this case which would necessarily and mandatorily result in
a sentence of death; as it did. the jury had to sharply focus
on a very narrow set of circumstances, and that is whether the
accused intentionally killed a police officer who was in the
performance of his lawful duty.
The facts in this case — there could be no clearer
facts in such an issuet

It was Mardi Gras Day in 197^ and

Harry Roberts started shooting various people in his neighborhood

17

anc3 wounded a little boy.

The neighbors called the police

and Officers John Tobin and Dennis Mclnerney answered the call,
dressed in uniform and in a marked police car.
As they approached the scene of the shooting, they
were told by a bystander that the person they wanted was
dressed In blue trousers, beige shirt, and was wearing a red
cap and he was going over that way.
They proceeded in that direction and just turning the
corner they saw Harry Roberts taking a red cap off of his
head.

They parked the police car at an angle, right in front

of Roberts to get out and talk to him.

Roberts walked up to

the police car and shot Officer Mclnerney as he — Officer Tobin
as he sat in the car.

Officer Mclnerney jumped out and was

shot and mortally wounded by Roberts at this time, died within
a few seconds.
Officer Tobin, although wounded, was able to draw
his service revolver and wound Roberts in the leg.

Thereupon,

Roberts ran off, limping and leaving a trail of blood and took
refuge in a neighboring house, where he was captured a few
minutes later by police officers who were brought to the scene
by the wounded officer, John Tobin.
Now, the State feels that if ever there is a factual
circumstance presenting the intentional killing of a police
officer in the performance of his lawful duty, this is it ~~
not even any questions to the man, nothing to irritate him or

18

throw him off.

He just — when he saw the police car stop,

he went up to it and shot the first officer sitting in the car,
the second officer, killed him as he got out to question him.
The State of Louisiana feels that under this Court’s
decision in Gregg v, Georgia, Proffitt v, Florida, and so forth,
Stanislaus Roberts v. Louisiana, in which this Court time and
again in footnotes and in dicta, cut out from its opinion
narrower specifically drawn statutes which focused on particular
circumstances that the jury would have before them»
again this Court cut those out.

Time and

That’s what we have here.

Moreover, this Court, in those cases, specifically
approved Georgia 6s and Florida cs bifurcated jury in which the
jury was to consider various circumstances, aggravating and
mitigating.

One of the aggravating circumstances approved by

this Court in those cases was the circumstance which provided
that the jury must consider under Florida and Georgia law and
under the Uniform Criminal Codes that are universally approved,
that is, that the murderer could, either during the course of
a lawful arrest or that the person killed, intentionally killed,
was a uniformed police officer or a police officer on duty, it
all amounts to the same thing, a police officer in the perfor­
mance of his lawful duty.
The Louisiana statute presents this very clearly to
the jury.

So it is narrowly drawn, it incorporates an aggrava­

ting circumstance.

19
Now, the State of Louisiana takes the position that
there are no mitigating circumstances that need to be given to
the jury when a police officer on duty is killed.
simple as that.

It is as

-/

If our society is to exist, and if one or two police­
men are going to control groups of violent people, mobs, and
so forth, continually being called to investigate dangerous
situations, such as we have in the present case, that there are
no mitigating circumstances which will excuse a person gunning
down a police officer engaged in the performance of his duty,
and that, therefore, the lack of mitigating circumstances
having been presented to the jury in a special sentencing
procedure — Of course, all these mitigating circumstances can
always be presented to the jury during the trial on the merits.
In argument to the jury, anything like insanity or
drunkenness or youth or first offender can always be presented
to the jury at the trial on the merits.

It is not as though

they donEt hear mitigating circumstances.
The State of Louisiana further believes that the
responsive verdict system which this Court seemed to disapprove
of in Stanislaus Roberts, in no way invalidates the present
mandatory death sentence because of the trial judgefs instruc­
tions which we have forwarded to this Court which were not in­
cluded in the record but we have sent to this Court.
This Court will see that the trial judge very

20

patiently and in every day language explained to the jury about
first degree murder and that he would be sentenced to death if
you find so and so and so and so.

If you find that he was not

a police officer, second degree murder.

If you find that there

was provocation, manslaughter, and so forth.
And for the same reason we feel that the lack of
appellate review by the Louisiana Supreme Court does not in­
validate the mandatory death sentence here either because of the
fact that the jury, in effect, was given such strict guidelines
for its deliberations and whether it should bring in a verdict
of guilty as charged which would result in a mandatory death
sentence that there was no leeway for capriciousness and
so forth, which this Court deplored in Gregg v. Georgia and
Stanislaus Roberts, and so forth.
So, if the Court has no questions —
QUESTION;

I have one question:

Has the Louisiana

Supreme Court construed the statute on the intent element to
require that the defendant know that the victim was a police
officer?
MRS. KORNS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, such a question has

never presented itself, as far as I know.

You see, in the

instant case, the officers were dressed in uniform and they
were riding in a police car, and there is no doubt about it.
Now, the trial judge in the present case said that
the difference between first degree

the difference between

21
the guilty verdict, guilty as charged, which would result in
the mandatory death sentence, and the first responsive verdict
of guilty of second degree murder, that the one element of
difference in the crimes would be that the victim was a police
officer.
QUESTION:

But it hasn't answered the question of,

say, you had an officer in plain clothes in ambiguous circum­
stances»
MRS * KORNS:

I am sure you would have to —• I would

say that it would have to be reasonably apparent that the man

I would think, but the court hasn't

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JULES E. ORENSTEIN, ESQ .,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR, ORENSTEIN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Jules E. Orenstein and the Assistant Attorney
General of the State of New York, of counsel to the amicus
curiae in this case, The Honorable Louis J0 Lefkowitz, Attorney
General of the State of New York.
We appear here in support of the position of the
State of Louisiana and in support of the concept that a mandatory
death penalty for the killing of a police officer is constitu­
tionally acceptable.
Of necessity, our argument must be of an empirical or
pragmatic nature.

Our starting point, I think, as far as our

position is concerned, has its genesis in the plurality Foot­
note Number 7,- I believe, in the case decided last July in
Woodson v. North Carolina.
As we read that footnote and the opinion of the
plurality and the comments by other justices of this Court in
their dissents, there was reserved for a future day the deter­
mination of the question of whether or not a unique category
of homicidal offense could, in certain circumstances, justify
the imposition of the death penalty.
We say that the killing of a police officer is

24

another one of those few narrc ' "^-nations in which the inflic­
tion of the death penalty, mandatorily will sufficiently
justify, under today's contemporary standard, the infliction of
this particular death penalty.
Just this last week, within the last week, last
Tuesday, in the Gardner v, Florida case, there were some words
by the plurality in that decision which I think are very
pertinent here.
This Court's plurality opinion stated:

"It is of

vital importance to the defendant and to the community that any
decision to impose this death sentence be and appear to be based
on reason, rather than caprice or emotion,"
I think if we have ever had a situation where the
death penalty could be imposed mandatorily,, based upon reason,
vie have those .reasons here in the situation, the
limited narrow situation, where a police officer has been
killed in the line of duty by a person who knew or should have
known that the gentleman whom he killed was a police officer.
Empirically, we have seen some statistics cited by
our fellow amicae, the joint — as I term it, the joint law
enforcement amicae brief by the National District Attorneys
Association, Americans for Law Enforcement, the International
Conference of Police Chiefs and the National Sheriffs Associa­
tion,

I think the thing that really screams and cries out

for a ruling of protection for this class of victim,the police

25
officer, are the statistics that have been compiled, namely,
from 1966, through 1975* inclusive, you load twelve hundred and
three police officers killed in the line of duty*

The numbers

doubled between 1966, when you had fifty some-odd officers
killed.

They went into the one hundred and twenties and one

hundred and thirties by the time we hit the seventies.
the latest figure in '7^ was one hundred and thirty-two.

I think
Vie had

one hundred and twenty-nine in '75.
This ought to tell us something.
We have been speaking in terms, and I believe the
plurality opinion, and most of the opinions of this Court since
last July, have spoken in terms of-the need for protection of
society or the general need to protect society, but I think
here we have a special category, group,iMhich deems it necessary
to have a specific protection of that group.
These people are exposed.
and it is constant.

Their exposure is terrible

The figures justify this statement,

If, as this Court has stated, with regard to the
correctional officer, that he may be deemed a unique circumstance
if he happens to be killed in the line of duty while guarding
some prisoners in a correctional setting, the exposure of those
correctional officers is far less than the exposure of the
t

police officer who is in the line of duty,

Except for the fact that a correctional

Some may be, Mr. Justice —~

You know they are unarmed inside the walls,

MR. ORENSTEIN:

Well, there may be — I think there

Is a justifiable reason for that if they are unarmed —

All I said is you don't need that for

setting.

Well, you do have a controlled

I think one of the reasons this Court set forth —
QUESTION:

This one is cut there.

That's the

difference.
MRo ORENSTEIN:
Mr. Justice Marshall.

Exactly.

That's the point I make,

He is exposed.

Certainly, there would

be no deterrence in the correctional officer situation, If the
officer was killed by a life termer.

What does the perpetrator

have to look forward to. in anticipation of further Increased
punishment?

You have done^ actually, nothing.to him.

In fact,

all you've done is encourage him to possibly kill or murder the
correctional officer.
QUESTION:

What does Maine do when one of then is

murdered?
MR. ORENSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the other states that don't have death

penalities’.
MR. ORENSTEIN:
bney GO Xn

'cne

Well, Your Honor, I don't know what

other states, but I know certain states, such as

2?
the state I represent, certainly have a problem in the
criminal justice field and we certainly have problems which are
unique and different, not only in the number of crimes committed
but in the type of crimes committed,

*

Our urban areas, I think, have far greater problems
than, say, like a state, with all due respect to our sister
state of Maine, they don't have the situation we have.

They

don’t have the constant headlines screaming about homicides,
not only of correctional people or police officers, but ordinary
citizens who have been the subject or victim of a homicide,
I would also like to emphasise, and I have set forth
certain portions within our'brief, of the experience factor
that certain police officer personnel have experienced.

Now,

they say, from their experience, statistics aside, that when
they have talked to possible perpetrators or perpetrators in
the pa3t, they have found that the threat of the possible deathpenalty may very possibly and, in fact, in cases has stayed
that trigger finger, or whatever other weapon was to be used,
from inflicting the assault or murder upon the police officer.
In addition, I think the statistics of the California
and the Joint Lav; Enforcement amicae brief set forth the number
of assaults upon police officers in the year 1975* alone,
exceeded over 44,000 assaults.

I think it was 44,800- seme-odd

number of assaults, close to 4-5,000.
In addition, the plurality of this Court in the

28

Woodson and the Stanislaus Roberts cases, spoke in terms of the
fact that the — that it was defective in the plurality
opinion, the fact that in a mandatory situation there was no
one to really pass upon the nature of the crime, the character
or record of the particular defendant.
I say, and we say in this particular situation,
dealing with law enforcement personnel, the nature of the
crime speaks for itself.

You have a police officer, the

elements are there, the intentional killing of a police
officer on duty.
The act, itself, by the defendant or perpetrator,
of killing a police officer, under these circumstances,
certainly gives us an idea as to his character.
Another interesting statistic, I think, which may
fill the gap in the minds of some members of this Court with
respect to the lack of knowledge of the record of the perpe­
trator, can be found in those statistics on page 12 of the
amicae brief, the Joint Law-Enforcement brief, where they set
forth a very telling factor of 1438 persons identified in the
killing of law enforcement officers between 1966 and 1975?
76% of than had records of prior encounters with the criminal
justice process,

And of that number, 56$ had previous records,

convictions„
So, taking these factors all together, we are of the
opinion that one can harmonise these particular groups of

29
peace off .leers and their particular situation with the recent
July opinions of this Court, Including the plurality opinion,
We think we can satisfy and have satisfied the fact
that these factors are present, they are built-in, they are
subsumed by a jury verdict finding a particular perpetrator
not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
In New York, in many of our jurisdictions, there is
fair opportunity to present many of the conventional defenses
that one finds in the criminal trial process,
QUESTION:

Mr, Orensfcein, what do you do with the

Court’s recent decisions in the three cases of Green v. Oklahoma,
Sparks v. North Carolina and Washington v. Louisiana?
MR, ORENSTEXN:

I suggested in our brief, Mr, Justice

Stewart, that one, it was very possible for this Court to have
overlooked the situation that we were dealing with peace
officers,

I pointed out that at the time, dn July 6th, I

believe it was, this Court came down with many, many orders,
I think I counted 3^ to 36 in which numerous petitions for
certiorari which involved the death penalty from North Carolina,
Louisiana and Oklahoma were summarily reversed,
I see my time is up.

Do you wish me to continue?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Just to — You’ve answered

the question.
MR. 0RBN5TEIN:

That is my answer, sir,

I think

there was a mistake made^ otherwise we wouldn't be here today.

30
Thank you,for the honor and privilege of appearing —
Yes, Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION:

(inaudible) has confused the New York

situation, under your statute, for you, .hasn't it?
MR. ORENSTEIN:

Well, it has.

We do presently have

two people on death row, one for the killing of an officer,
police officer in the line of duty, the other for the killing
of a correctional officer by a person who was already charged
with murder.
Thank you for the honor and privilege of appearing
here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Rolling.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF. GARLAND R. ROLLING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROLLING:

If it please the Court, Ifd like to

just call the Court's attention to one or two factors.

One is

on the finality of the Johnson Washlngton case and the re ­
hearing in the state court.
I think, if it may please the Court, that the law
is that the J ohns on Wash ingt-on case is final.

When you denied

your rehearing here, it certainly supersedes any potential
opinion that the Louisiana Supreme Court could render.
I think that Johns on Washington will be in jail for
whatever time the law prescribes, but there is no way that this

31

Harry Roberts case can In any way affect Johnson Washington
case because of your previous denial of a rehearing.
I would like to further call the Court's attention —
and I have a basic disagreement with my colleague, Mrs. Korns,
/

on my right, under this existing law, to submit mitigating
circumstances to the jury during the trial.

There Is no way

that I could get up there or any other counsel could get up
there and spend four hours before the jury and tell the jury,
during the course of the guilt or innocence trial, thirty
reasons why you shouldn't execute this particular individual
without saying, "Look, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this
man is guilty, and here's why you shouldn't execute him."
In fact, we wouldn’t even have a guilt or innocence
trial, if that was true.

You are prohibited from doing it

unless you want to place yourself in that particular procedural
position.
The last thing is, at my conclusion, all of us are
opposed to crime,

God only knows I don't want to see anybody

killed, particularly police officers, or particularly agents
of the state, or anybody at all, but possibly if we give it
an opportunity to have these sentencing hearings which this
Court has announced was the principal law of the land, possibly
we can get some testimony, possibly we can look into the back­
ground of some of these criminals, possibly we can find out
why Officer kelnerney xias killed,

32
And remember my particular client denied his guilt
at all times.

But possibly we could find out whatEs xvrong,

what we can do, as individuals, as human beings, to correct
these people, to prevent this from happening in the future.
If we don't look into the cause of the crime, we are
never going to find out what to do to prevent the crime.
QUESTION:

One question on the merits which you

pressed for the second time.

Do you challenge Mrs. Korns'

statement that your client was trailed right from the place
where he shot the police officers and was found in a house with
the gun?

Is that in question?
MR. ROLLING:

May it please the Court:

My client

testified, got on the witness stand and took the witness
stand, and remember, this a nineteen year old, uneducated
youth, versus the full force and effect of the intellect of
the Attorney General's office of the State of Louisiana, and
matched wits with the Attorney General for an hour or two
hours, and he always said that he was not the one who did it.
This is Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

There are 9,000 people that

wear red bandanas on their head, everybody costumes.

There

x^ere a million people on the street.
QUESTION:

Was he shot in the leg?

MR. ROLLING:

He was shot in the leg and his testimony

•was that he was shot in the leg by an unknown assailant and he
ran into this particular house to use the phone to call the

33
police, and to call for, help.
Now, the jury resolved the facts against him.
don't know who is righto

I don't know who is wrong.

I

I don't

know what facts are correct or what facts are incorrect, but
there was a very serious factual dispute in this case.
We lost and I can certainly understand how a reason­
able man could have resolved the facts against him, just as I
think a reasonable man could have resolved the facts in his
favor, and nobody really knew what the jury was going to do.
But they are against us and that's why we are here.
Thank you, very kindly for the pleasure of
pleading here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:43 o’clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
