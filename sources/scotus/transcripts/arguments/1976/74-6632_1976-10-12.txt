ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS , PHYLIS SKLOOT BAMBERGER
•

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS, BAMBERGER;

Thank you. Your Honor,

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please the Courts
This case comes her© upon a writ, of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit* raising
the question of whether a federal parolee* who violates his
parole by 'the commission of a new crime* is constitutionally
entitled to a du© process revocation proceeding ©arl.y during
■the service of {he intervening sentence.
Two questione must be analysed;

Th© source or nature

of file interest* and the process which is due if there is an
interest.
As the facts in the case will reveal* such a hearing
in this case will determine how much of the almot six years
dus on the petitioner's first sentence will be served con­
currently with his present sentence* and thus will affect his
ultimate release date from custody altogether,
QUESTION;

Do you suggest that there is some

expectation — a basis for an expectation that it would be
allowed to

foe concurrent?

4
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Your Honor, under -the scheme — let

us step back a minute and say that he is in fact still on
parole.

His parole has not been revoked,, it has not been taken

away from him.
QUESTION: Well, we can hypothesise that.

But the fact

is he*s in another prison for the commission of another crime,
t

while he was on probation.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

While he was on parole.
Yes, Your Honor.

The scheme of the rules under which this case takes
place, of the Parole Board, envisions -that there is, indeed, a
good likelihood or a possibility of concurrency, and, in fact,
in Jones v„ Johnston, decided by the D. C. Circuit, it notes a
survey taken by the Federal Parole Board which would indicate
that one in -three of such parolees do in fact serve their
sentence concurrently or have the detainer revoked altogether.
Now, -QUESTION:
Bamberger?

What does that work out, in fact, Mrs.

Would you explain that to us?

How the concurrency

comes about.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Under the rules, as

they applied in this case, and those rules are no

longer in

effect because of the new statute and the new rules, the Board
would review a file, the Parol© Board file, and w© know that the
file consisted of the pre-sentence report, the case agent's
report, the information which the supervising parol© officer

5
had obtained during the period of parole.
At the end of that review, the Board could give one
of three dispositions.
detainer altogether.

It could revoke, it could remove the
In that situation, the parolee would get

full concurrency with the present sentence, and, in fact, he
would be restored

to the position that he would have been in,

had the warrant never been issued.

That is, he would get

street time, he would get good time, and his sentences would
in essence be running at the same time.
QUESTIONS Wien you sa.y full concurrency, that means
that the time that h® would be serving under his first sentence
begins to run again?
MRS. BAMBERGER:

It would have

yes, he would

have lost no time back to the date of his release, in fact.
Now, the other, th© second disposition which the
Board could have made is to revoke parol®.

Nov/, that's where

we get into the question, and the possibility which would come
up

-the real possibility which would com® up in a case such

as this.

From the moment of the Board's dscision to revoke

parole, the sentence would start to run, would commence to run
concurrently with the new sentence.
In other words, -the issuance of the warrant stops the
time on the first sentence from running.

When -the Board gives

its review and makes a decision to execute the warrant, in
essence to revoke parole,from that moment, under the Board's

6

regulation, the time commences to run again? and it is, in fact,
running concurrently with the new term.
And so he is actually serving two sentences at the
same time, and his release date on the first sentence will
obviously be shortened, because ha's serving that sentence.
Now, the third disposition, the one which took place
here, is to have the file review and to do nothing, to let
the warrant and tire detainer stand.
In that situation, it is automatic, under the Board's
prior rules and under the present rules, that the first
sentence will fo© served consecutively to the new sentence? so
that when he is released from the second sentence and returned
to the federal institution, he then recommences -that first
sentence, and h® has to serve it.
Now, he may be released on parole at soma point later
on, but he is still either in custody or in parole custody.
QUESTIONi

But I thought he could, at that last step,

b© held to have served it concurrently.
MRS. BAMBERGER?
of retroactive concurrency.
QUESTION:

Your Honor, that gets to the question
In other words, at the time

So it's possible.

MRS. BAMBERGER:

No, it is — I do not believe 'that

it is possible under the Board8s rules,

There is no provision,

either under the old rules or under the new rules for the Board
to male® the sentence run back to an earlier point in time.

If

7
the Board does not give its hearing at an earlier date during
the service of the intervening sentence# it loses the power to
male© that terra run back to a certain date,

And I think 'that

th's the crux of the matter here# is that his — or at least
on©.of the liberty interests ■—
QUESTION:

The Board couldn't release him?

MRS a BAMBERGER:
QUESTION:

The Board —

Could not release him*

MRS, BAMBERGER:

They could re-parole him# or —

well # at that point# -they could do several things„ They could
remove the dataller altogether# so that he would get full
concurrency.
Now# in a situation where a parolee has committed a
new crime# that —
QUESTION:

I’m talking about aftar he served his first

sentence.
MRS» BAMBERGER:

Yes# they could remove the detainer#

the warrant and the detainer altogether# and that would put him
back in the position that he was in at the date of his first
release.

He would get full credit for all of that time# from

the date of his release to the date of the Board’s decision#
which may# in fact# —
QUESTION:

I thought you said that's what they couldn’t

do.
HRS. BAMBERGER:

They cannot give him partial

8

retroactive concurrency»
In other words, if a man is -~
QUESTION:

I didn’t say partial,

MRS. BAMBERGER:

if a man is released on parol®

on January 1st, and he violates and he is sentenced to a new
sentence, and he serves that sentence and ha is released on
January 1st of the following year, at that point he gets a
parole revocation hearing,
Th© Parole Board, unless it totally lifts the detainer,
cannot make his term run again from th® first January 1st,
It cannot make his terra run frora, say, March 1st or April 1st,
QUESTION: But they can lift th© retainer.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

It can lift it altogether.

But that

eliminates from the Board its third option, which is to let the
sentences run concurrently from some intermediate point during
th© intervening sentence.
QUESTION:

Let me see if I follow you. Are you saying

that the Board may not credit time served?
MRS. BAMBERGER;

Not if it revokes, no.

Now f if it revokes during the period of the inter­
vening sentence, from that moment the two

say, on March 1st

of this January 1st to January 1st sentence, the first term will
continue to run as of March 1st, so he will get ten months’
credit on his old sentence.
of credit

He will lose the first two months

9

If the Board revokes . altogether. — I'm sorry - if the
Board lifts the warrant altogether, 'then he will gat the roll
year.
What the Board cannot do at the end of the intervening
sentence is to make -the term run concurrently from some —retroactively to some intermediate date.

It can give him the

full tern, but not a partial term of credit.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Bamberger, may it not do substantially

the equivalent thing by deciding to parole him somewhat earlier
than they otherwise would have paroled him?
MRS. BAMBERGER;

Well, but then he loses — the

revocation causes him to los©

well, first, the answer to that

is not the sain® tiling, because he is still in parole custody as
opposed to having complete freedom.
QUESTION:

Correct.

MRS. BAMBERGER;
QUESTION;

I understand that.

And during til at

But he could be released from incarceration

at an earlier data -than he otherwise would.
MRS. BAMBERGER:
about

Yes. But there can't be any doubt

the Bor ad could do -that in its discretion, but there’s

no doubt about the fact that total freedom is better than the
conditional freedom of parol®.
QUESTION:

Could the problem, this problem you

describe, be cured by an amendment to the Board regulations,
to give them a little broader discretion at that point?

10

MRS. BAMBERGER:
QUESTION:

To give them power to allow a partial ~~

MRS. BAMBERGER;
QUESTION;

You mean to give him partial ~~

Partial retroactive,

— credit.

MRS. BAMBERGER:

It could, but there than is still

another problem with the liberty interest.
QUESTION; Well, before you get cn to the other one,
let me clear up another thing that troubled me.
You pointed out that if there were total revocation
"*” if there were revocation immediately upon conviction of the
State crime, that then the sentences under present regulations
would be served

concurrently, —

MRS. BAMBERGER;
QUESTION;

That's right.

— and that's the benefit your client lost.

MRS. BAMBERGER; That’s right.
QUESTION; But if we should decice the case for you,
is it not possible that the Board would adopt new regulations,
which would make that —- would change that and make it the
normal practice to make the sentence be consecutive rather than
concurrent?
i

MRS. BAMBERGER:

0’n, v©3.

In assuming — and in fact

there are several States that do that.

It’s interesting that

two of the amici in this case require that the sentence run
consecutively. There is no discretion in the Board one way or
the other, the sentences must run consecutively

11
In that case there is no deprivation of liberty as
opposed to having a liberty interest.
do that.

And yet the Board could

And —
QUESTION: So that your liberty claim really is

contingent, if I understand your correctly, on the present form
of the Board regulations*

The Board could revise their

regulations in a way that would defeat the liberty interests
which you assert.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

It couldn't defeat the liberty

interests, but it could male© the denial of that liberty
interest not in essence a denial? it could make it harmless, yes.
That’s right.
QUESTION: That's what I'm saying.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Except that there is another side to

this liberty interest, and that is when a person is in an
institution with a parole detainer lodged against him, the Board
is, in effect, imposing conditions of parole.

It has modified

the conditions of parole, because of the effect of that parole
detainer upon the prison conditions.
Nov;, this is not the argument that was rejected in
Moachum and Montayne, although we do present that argument in
our brief, and we believe that under the Bureau of Prisons
regulations there is an interest in the conditions that a
prisoner has in an institution, in not
QUESTION;

Mrs. Bamberger, on that point, would you

12

help me» because it's kind of & subtle point» but is there
a difference in terms of the conditions of confinement between
having a detainer lodged against the man» or» in the alternative»
having no detainer» but. having 'the fact noted of record that he
was convicted of the State crime?
MRSo BAMBERGER:

Oh» yes.

There is a difference.

And» in fact» two States» which again aigned the amicus brief»
direct —> they lodge the detainer so -that the confining
prison will have notice that there is another proceeding pending»
and then they lift the detainer with a notice to the confining
institution -that the detainer is not to have any effect on the
conditions of confinement.
Now» as a Bureau of Prisons regulation» cited in our
brief» indicates» there is consideration separately of the
facts of the new crime and the fact of the detainer being
present.

The reason is twofold.
No, 1» the Bureau of Prisons considers» in making its

classification study» both the length of total confinement ~
now» where there's a detainer pending» the length of total con­
finement can fo® much longer# because h® may have to serve the
parole sentence# and the Parole Board has# in essence# notified
not only that it wants to take -this man back# but that h@ may
have to serve a very long sentence# or some sentence» at the
end of the intervening sentence.
The other thing that the Bureau of Prisons considers

13

in its classification study is whether the individual can
sustain himself in a position of relatively unsupervised or
degree of supervision that he’s required.
How, if the detainer is present, it’s an indication to
the Bureau of Prisons that there was something wrong with the
parolee’s ability to structure himself without constant watching.
And ‘that also goes into the classification study:

what institu­

tion he will be in? what jobs will be available to him? whether
he will he on minimum or maximum custody in that institution.
So that, yes, the detainer does have a definite and
separata impact, aside from the facts of the new crime, on the
classification,
Now, -~*~
QUESTION:

Is it possible, Mrs, Bamberger, that the

conduct of the prisoner in prison under the second sentence,
for whatever period he's there, would have some bearing on the
Parole Board's exercise of discretion as to whether or not
they ought to then require him to serve all of the balance of
his first sentence?
MRS, BAMBERGER:

Yes, it -- and that’s one of the

government’s arguments? but the answer to that *—
QUESTION:

Yes, but why should they then be compelled

to make the decision before they know what his conduct is going
to b©?
MRS, BAMBERGER:

Well, I think the answer is as follows,

14
because the decision-making process, as far as the Board is
concerned, includes much more than just the institutional
conduct,» The institutional conduct will always be there for them
to review on documents that are presented by the institutions
periodically.
But the Board is also concerned with his life out in
the community while he was out on parole,- the full Parole Board
file, which includes FBI reports, correspondence from various
people, and the facts of the new crime.
Now, with -that —
QUESTION: But aren’t you overlooking the fact that
they have already determined that he has committed a criminal
act, and there is, by full due process, a judgment of the court
that he has violated his conditions of his parole?
MRS. BAMBERGER;

Your Honor, that gets right to the

question of the nature of this right, -that; the federal —
QUESTION: Which right?
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Of the parolee's rights.

The

federal parole scheme requires a two-stage process, exactly
like the one outlined in Morrissey.

There is the determination

of whether or not there has been a violation, and in this case
that’s out. of -the picture? but there’s also the dispositional
aspect of the case.

The Board has an obligation to make a

disposition.

It is not required to make any particular

disposition.

It. is not required to revoke. And this gets back

15
to an earlier question that was asked.

If the Board were

required to revoke on the basis of a new conviction, then he
would not have any claim, conviction would eliminate his interest
in conditional freedom which was provided by -the grant of
parole,
QUESTION; But perhaps ‘the Board's position might be
that we don’t want to make the decision on whether we’ll revoke
the parole until we see how he conducts himself in this second
round, under his second conviction.

That is, if, during that

second period, his conduct is such that he’s denied all his
good-time credits, if he engages in prison riots and violence,
I suppose you would agree -that the Parole Board would not be
very sympathetic with having his sentences run concurrently,
MRS, BAMBERGER;

Well, let me answer that by saying

that the Board can consider at an early hearing all of the noninstitutional factors relating to mitigation,
QUESTION;

No, but let’s stick to my question,

MRS, BAMBERGER;

Now ~ get to — if they make the

decision, and it's unfavorable to the parolee, during the term
of his institution, the Board has the right to reopen, based
on information it receives at the — from the institution.
So that it can reconsider an adverse decision to the parolee,
based on institutional conduct.
Now, if they render a favorable decision to the
parolee, and he is granted parole so he can serve a dual

16

status, which is recognized in the parole scheme, he can be
serving the second sentence and on parole with respect to the
first sentence, the Board can, in essence, revoke the parole
that it had granted him, bared on his prison conduct*

So the

Board is not left without a remedy either to consider favorable
or adverse the institutional conduct*
Now, the question as to whether or not this reconsider­
ation of the case has to have an in-court appearance for the
due process requirements of such a review proceeding is not
before the Court.
But the Board is not precluded, even by its own rules,
and never has been, from considering institutional conduct.
In tha first situation, under the rules which applied
at the time that this case earn® up, they did it by an annual
review.
Under the Board's present statute, they can always
reopen and always reconsider information which is presented to
them.
And so I think that the argument that the institutional
conduct has -bo b® considered is correct, but it doesn't go far
enough, because what we have to do is we have to freeze the
mitigating circumstances that would come up with respect to the
life in tha community and the factors of the new crime.
flow, the question of mitigation, of course, goes to
what process is due under the circumstances. What is the interest?

17
What is the private interest of tee parolee in presenting his
mitigating circumstances?
And I think teat that's where teat factor comes up,
if a parolee has committed a new crime,, the Board can consider
that; it also can consider its full recordo

But at the time of

his record review tee parolee is not allowed to be present, h@
doesn't know what's in the Parole Board file because until the
present statute and the possible applicability of the Right to
Privacy Act provisions, he had no disclosure of the file
now, we don't know what tee file indicates in this case, but the
government has indicated, from the facts teat it has presented,
teat there are certain mitigating circums tances «
For instance, in this case, the judge could have
sentenced tee defendant up to life imprisonment,,

He didn’t»

He gave him two consecutive terms of custody —• I’m sorry, two
concurrent terms of custody of only up to ten years, although
his discretion to impose the life sentence was present»
He also made the sentence run under 4208(a)(2), which
meant that the Parole Board could parole him on the second
crime at any point it desired»
So obviously the judge believed that there was some­
thing there which did not require the full extent of his
sentencing powers.
Now, the government appendix includes a document from
the Parole Board file, and it's interesting,because that docu-

18

menfc, in itself;, contains information which is not confirmed,
which we don't know is error®

For instance, it indicates that

he murdered his wife.
In fact, that was not the crime that he was convicted
of,, he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the heat of
passon®

And we don't know what those facts are; it's not

reflected in the record, nor in the documents which the govern­
ment chases to add as part of its appendix.
It reflects -that there was a conflict as to his family®
The report indicates that his family had alcoholic problems.
He indicates that ha had a good family relationship®
How, in terms of whether ox‘ not to revoke parole,
where the parolee will live is obviously an important
consideration.

There's a very critical dispute of fact here,

which should have been resolved in a situation where the
parolee could present his mitigating circumstances.
Now, the government argues -that there were no mitigat™
ing circumstances presented here®

I think the fact is due

in part, No. 1, to the possibility which' is reflected in tee
record that the petitioner did not know that he could submit
mitigating circumstances, he was never told that.

And the

documents submitted by tee Board establish that fact.
The second factor, of course, is the same as in
Goldberg, is teat he might not. have known how to do it, or
what was relevant, or what to put before the Board.

Because

19
he had no representation, nor one who could assist him in that»
And then, as another matter, he never knew the basis
for the Board’s decision to make his sentence run consecutively,
because they never told him what factors they wer© considering9
and the reasons for their decision to make the sentence run
cons @cut!v@ly„
And so til® absence of mitigating circumstances here
should not be held against, toe petitioner and, in fact, the
record, as presented by the government, indicates that there
may b® substantial disputes of facts, and the Board should have
known both sides of th© story in an amply presented argument
on behalf of the petitioner.
Now, if —■ the government argues that its total
discretion to revoke the parole after a new crime eliminates
the parol® status which he still presently enjoys.
The answer, I think, is to at both Gagnon and Morrissey
and Goldsmith and Roto dispute that argument, they lay it to
rest.

Gagnon and Morrissey both say -that where there is a

vested interest, which he still has, both toe State and the
t

parolee have an interest in accurate factofinding and an
informed use of discretion.
The citation in Roth to Goldsmith indicates that toe
broad discretionary power must be construed to mean an
exercise of discretion after investigation, notice, hearing,
and opportunity to respond.

None of that was afforded here.

20

Now, the remedy that would be afforded the petitioner
in this instance would be# first# if the Court were to find that
there wasn't an interest# and were also to find that it was
protected by due process, the first remedy would be to remand
to the district court to determine whether or not he lost any
mitigating evidence due to the substantial delay between 1971
and this time# in granting a timely hearing.
If -that were not true# if he hadn't lost any mitigating
evidence# then h© would be entitled to a parole revocation
under the new statuta.
Now# it is not necessary for the Court to consider the
new statute# if it were to find that the old proceedings were
invalid# because the new statute affords the petitioner certain
due process rights# which may indeed satisfy Morrissey# depending
upon how the Board was commissioned now# chooses to enforce its
nsitf rules o
First# it provides him with counsel.
Second# it may provide him with disclosure of -the full
file.
Third# the Board may find that# under its regulations#
it can provide notice of -the reasons and the facts underlying
its decision.

And its own regulations require notice of the

underlying charges and reasons and procedures.
So that I think# if we find that the old procedures
were invalid# that the new ones should be given an opportunity

21
to b© used in this situation to determine whether or not —
to determine whether or not it provides with due process ,
QUESTION5

How can you say this is still a live case,,

Mrs„ Bamberger, if new rules have been substituted for the ones
that you’re litigating?
MRSo BAMBERGER;

Well, it's still a live case

because the petitioner here is not eligible for a hearing under
the new rules, because there’s a provision in the statute which
says that any valid order of the Parole Board shall not be
reopened or reconsidered under the new statute,.'
So that unless the old procedures are deemed invalid,
which we believe they are, because there is an interest, there’s

a present interest as Roth defines it, and the old procedures
did not adequately protect that interest, that he would be
entitled to a new proceeding to determine whether or not his
parole should be revoked, to determine whether or not he should
get concurrent sentences, and to determine whether or not, as
the Board has the option to do, to leave tie detainer in effecto
QUESTION?

And if the Court rules against him, then

h® would not have the advantage of a new rule?

If the Court

rules against your constitutional contention, he couldn't go back
and say, “Wall, now I want a hearing under the new rules"?
MRS8 BAMBERGERs That’s right.

Tie only thing that

could happen is that the Board could periodically review the
institutional reports, and perhaps revise its decision based on

22
those reports.
But it wouldn’t reconsider the mitigating factors
with respect ‘to his life on parole,with respect to the crime,
and other factors which he may choose to introduce.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.
Mr. Eas terb rook.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EAS TE RB 'ROOK# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The claim

of a right to an immediate oral parole

hearing in this case has an aura of iraplausibility to it.
Petitioner is not now suffering imprisonment on
account of his parole violations.

No one proposes to revoke his

parole now.
He suffers no loss of freedom now because of the
possibility of revocation a year from now., when his sentences
for murder and manslaughter will com© to an end.
His losses caused by his intervening convictions and
ten-year sentence# the possibility of revocation, eventually#
is not caused by the detainer lodged against him? it was caused
by the intervening convictions upon his plea of guilty.

23

Petitioner has had a full hearing on the question of
his guilt and the murder convictions establish a full founda­
tion for the eventual revocation of parole, if that is what the
Parole Commission decides to do.
In the sentencing hearing on his two convictions, he
had both the opportunity and the incentive to bring forward
any mitigating evidence he might have, that might indue® either
the sentencing judge or the Parole Commission to treat him
leniently.
Petitioner has met with a social worker in federal
prison, and refused even to discuss with the social worker any
mitigating conditions or circumstances.

He told the social

worker that all toe information was in his file.

That state­

ment appears at page 26a of the Appendix of our brief.
To this day, petitioner has not said what he wants to
say in an immediate oral dispositional hearing, let alone what
he wants to say that cannot be conveyed equally well on paper.
He has made no cl turn that would, if true, induce to©
Parole Commission to invoke his parole and to let toe revoca­
tion run concurrently.
1 will devote my argument to three propositionss

First, that no hearing is necessary at any time,
one© the violations of to© conditions of parole have been
established,as they were here, beyond dispute.
Second, that the time for an oral hearing, if one is

24

required, doss not arrive until the end of the intervening
sentence when the Parole Commission decides to revoke petitioner’s
parole„
Third, that if something is required

before that

time, the Parole Commission’s dispositional review procedure
provides ample safeguards against error»
The due process clause requires a hearing concerning
the revocation of petitioner’s parole,in this case, only if
petitioner has a liberty interest or a property interest in
continuing to be a parolee.
We think -that there is no liberty or peropcrty
interest in a cas© like this on®.
Petitioner doubtless has an interest in a constitu­
tional sens®, held in common with his other man, in being
free from imprisonment until, by a judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, it has been decided that he must
surrender ‘that interest for a period of years.
That interest was extinguished for a period of ten
years, by his 1962 conviction for rape.

Petitioner served a

little more than four years of that before being released on
parole.

And that release on parole restored to him a form of

conditional liberty, parole, created by statute, the terns and
conditions and extent of which are defined entirely by statute.
This new conditional liberty is a creature of -the
statute, and petitioner has no more of it than the statute

25
provides .
The federal statutes and' regulations provide for
termination of this conditional liberty if the parolee commits
another crime. That happened here»

Once that happens , every

fact necessary to revoke parol® has been established,,

The

decision whether to revoke parole in response to those facts
is committed to the discretion of the Parol© Commission»
Let m@ make it clear that w© have no dispute with
Morrissey’s

holding that a grant of parole sets up a legitimate

claim of entitlement that can be revoked only upon

provision

of dus process»
What this means , though, is that before revoking
parole, the responsible officials must determine, by a procedure
comporting with th© due process clause, that the conditions of
the parol® have been violated, and that -~
QUESTIONi

Mr» Easterbrook, can I just ask you,

right at that point, is it your view that Morrissey dees not
apply to any case in which the parolee admits the fact
justifying revocation?
MR. EASTERBRQOKs

Yes, Your Honor, that is our view.

It is our view, in sum, that once the facts justifying
■the revocation have been established, those facts forfeit, the
claim of entitlement to remain free, and once that claim of
entitlement can no longer be set up against the parole author­
ities , there is no remaining liberty or property interest.

26

Petitioner has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder
and to voluntary manslaughter..
his parole*

Two violations are the terms of

No more is required.

Those convictions ended his

legitimate claim of entitlement to retain his statutory liberty
interest.
QUESTION;

Nr* Easterbrook, I don’t have the Morrissey

opinion in front of me, but I have a recollection of there
being a discussion of the double need for fair procedure.
One, to establish the fact of violation; another on the
dispositional phase.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

That’s right, Your Honor.

are two discussions of that sort in Morrissey.

There

One discussion,

appearing at page 490 of the Morrissey opinion, says, and I
quote, "If it’s determined that petitioners admitted violations
to the Parole Board, and if those violations are found to be
reasonable grounds for revoking parole under State standards,
that would end the matter,81
That has happened here.
of guilty.

There have been two convictions

It’s clear that those convictions are reasonable

grounds for revoking parole, and we think that ends the matter.
But Morrissey went on to say that, it would be useful
to have a parole hearing — and this is at page 480 -- for the
purpose of determining whether the Parole Board should exercise
its discretion.
We have no dispute with 'that, either.

The relevant

27

federal statutes, both at the time of tbs consideration of
petitioner's case and now, provide for two hearings, one is an
ultimata hearing before parole is revoked, and one is the
dispositional review which may or may not include a hearing,
depending upon whether the Parole Commission believes that one
is necessary,,
So we have no dispute with the proposition that it's
useful to have a hearing, to determine how the discretion shall
be exercised? the question whether the Constitution requires
that hearing is, we think, left open in Merrissey, because in
Morrissey 'the fact of violation itself was disputed, and the
question whether the Constitution required a hearing in the
absence of such dispute was not before the Court»
QUESTIONS Well, how is that question different from
the question you have in any criminal case, where you have,
first, the determination of guilt where clearly there must be
due process applied, and then a subsequent discretionary
hearing before the judge as to what senfcer.ee shall be imposed?
Why is — I take it the Constitution does require a
fair procedure at the sentencing hearing? but why is the
N situation differant at the other?
MR» EASTERBROOKs

There is one way in which it is

different and one way in which it is the same, Your Honor»
The way in which it is different, is that that is part
of the criminal process and it is directly controlled by tire

23

Sixth Amendment,

This Court held- in Hemp a v, Gray, that

counsel was required at a sentencing hearing, basing its holding
entirely on the Sixth Amendment,
But th© Court held in Morrissey and Gagnon that fch®
Sixth Amendment does not apply to parole revocation hearings
and to parole proceedings? and that’s —
QUESTION: Well, are you saying that "-putting the
Sixth Amendment to on© side for a moment, are you saying that
the due process clause has no application to a sentencing
hearing in a criminal proceeding?
MR, EAS TERR ROOK:

We’re saying that the due process

clause has no application, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

In fact, --

To th® sentencing proceeding in a criminal

trial?
MR, EASTERBROOKs

That’s right, Your Honor,

The Court held, in Specht v, Patterson, a case that's
cited and discussed in ou..r brief, that -there is no need, at a
sentencing nearing conducted by State authorities, to allow the
accused to be heard or to present evidence.
And it’s our view that that is tie same here, one©
it's been established beyond doubt that there has been a
violation, as here, there is no need to allow the accused to h®
present or to present evidence,
QUESTION; What’s the underlying theory?
no

That he has

this is not going to have any deprivation of his liberties

29

as a result of a sentencing hearing?

Or how do you analytically

fit that in?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

The analytical theory, I think, is

that the legitimate claim of entitlement to remain fra®, the
liberty interest, is -QUESTIONS

I'm talking about the criminal proceeding,

not the
MR. EASTERBROOK;

Yes, Your Honor0

QUESTION;

That’s gone once he’s found guilty?

Yes.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

Is gone once he’s found guilty.

Or once he pleads guilty.
QUESTION;

And he has an insufficient interest in

whether the sentence is for ten days or for life, to justify
due process?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

His interest in the range of

sentences is protected by the statute establishing the range
of permissible sentences.

And of course in the federal

system, I would like to point out that there is no arbitrary
procedure in the federal system.

Congress has provided for

procedures that go, in our view, well beyond what the
Constitution requires.
QUESTION;

What about ■*— he could get probation,

couldn't he?
MR. EASTERBROOK;
could. Your Honor

In the federal system?

Yes, he

30
QUESTION: So, X mean, either he has his liberty or

not.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

The federal system allows a broad

range of alternatives from a suspended sentence to a sentence
the maximum of its statute.

The question whether that is

provided is entirely committed to the discretion of the judge.
That proposition is supported by the Dors zynski case
in 418 U„S,, in which the Court held that not even a statement
of reasons is required for what the judge does, and that there
is no way, under the present constitutional statutes, to
inquire into what the judge has done, unless Congress provides
explicitly that that should be done.
QUESTION:

You mean that a judge could be arbitrary?

In sentencing.
You mean a judge could say that everybody that comes
in here with red hair, X give ten years; and those that don’t
have red hair, I'll probate?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
of a different sort.

Your Honor, that raises a question

That's the question of the reliance on

an impermissible reason.
QUESTION:

But you say he doesn’t need any reason.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

In our view, if there is no reason,

then the judge has full discretion, and the Parole Commission
has full discretion.
Let m® set. up a contrast between two cases,.

Last

31

spring —
QUESTION: Well, suppose it shows, the record shows
~ he never gave any reason, but -the record showed that h© had
sentenced forty people, twenty red heads and twenty non-red
heads, each red head had gotten twenty years and each non-red
head had been paroled?

You wouldn't find anything wrong with

that?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

Yes, Your Honor, we would. And we

would find something wrong in the reliance on an impermissible
and irrelevant reason.
But the question whether it’s permissible to rely on
an irrelevant or impermissible reason is different from the
question whether there must be an oral hearing to determine
whether such considerations have entered the process.
Let m© offer as an example Elrod v, Byrnes, a case
decided last spring, in which the Court held that employees
who held their positions in Illinois at the discretion of their
employer, no statutory safeguards, no property interest in their
employment, could not be discharged for reasons based on their
political beliefs.

That was use of an improper reason.

Yet, at the same time, the employees in Elrod y, Byrnes
were in the same position as -the employees in Board of Regents
v. Roth.

They could ba discharged for any reason without the

need for a hearing.
QUESTION;

Mr. Easterbrook, there5s a big difference

32
between that and the question Mr. .Justice Marshall asked.
In Elrod v, Byrnes they allegedly were discharged for a
constitutionally impermissible reason, namely, the exercise of
free speech rights.

There!s no constitutional right to be

a red head.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It might be suggested, Your Honor,

that you have very little choice in being a red head at birth,
I mean, the use of that is discriminatory —
QUESTION:
the point.

No, but the Constitution is neutral on

It’s completely independent of any constitutional

claim.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

I think the point is the same,

Your Honor, though, that a claim that a decision has been made
for an impermissible reason is very different from a claim that
a decision has been made without notice and an opportunity for
an oral hearing.
And that it is not necessary to have a hearing in
every case in order to minimise or avoid the possibility of
reliance on an improper reason.
QUESTION :

Mr. Hasterbrook, how long, in British

common law and the law in the United States, has it been sine©

MR, EASTERBROOK:

to Mr, Justice Stevens’ question, that a hearing will be help­
ful to determine whether the authority should exercise discretion
to revoke parole*

In the federal system a hearing is provided®

At the end of the intervening sentences for murder
and manslaughter «—
QUESTION:

Mr, Easterbrook, I hate to interrupt, as

34
you get to tea heart of your argument, but you’ve directed
my attention to page 488, and you just used the terra, that
the opinion suggested that a hearing would be usefulj but as I
read the sentence, -the parolee must have an opportunity to be
heard and to show if he can that he did not violate the
condition or, if he did, that the circumstances in mitigation
suggest that the violation does not warrant revocation»
The ”mustE’ language applies to both considerations»
MR» EASTERBROOKs

Yes»

To ‘bhe extent the "must”

clause applies to both considerations, it’s inconsistent with
the language on page 490 of the same opinion, indicating that
if it were established that there had been a violation, that
would end the matter,
QUESTION:

Do you think this *— do you think the

language on 488 is constitutionally inaccurate, in other words?
MR, EASTERBROOKs

It’s inaccurate in light of the

language on page 490, Your Honor,
QUESTIONS

But I just want to be sure I understood

your position»
MR» EASTERBROOKs

Yes,

That is our position.

Petitioner is not now subjected to imprisonment as a
parole violator»

His imprisonment is justified by tee ten-year

sentence imposed in 1371 for murder and manslaughter,
Morrissey held ~ and this time I quote another
sentence on page 4 88 of the same opinion **«* -chat tee right time

35

for a hearing was "a reasonable time after the parolee is taken
into custody”»
Petitioner has not yet been taken into custody as a
parole violator, and so the time set by the court for a hearing
has not yet arrived»
Several reasons support the decision of Congress to
defer hearings until the expiration of the intervening sentence.
Revocation is the rule, and earlier hearings would be useless
in most cases,

A hearing at the end of the intervening sentence

is the best time, because then the Parole Commission has avail­
able to it all of the information about the parolee’s institu­
tional behavior and can answer the question, Should the
prisoner now be released?
It will have access to the parolee’s prison record,
and it will avoid the inconvenience of sending teams of
examiners to prisons to make recommendations that will, in every
case, or almost every case, have to be reconsidered at the end
of the intervening sentence»
A hearing could be required years before the ultimate
decision on revocation only if the detainer affected liberty or
property rights in some way»
the core of petitioner’s

And, as we understand it, this is

argument.

Petitioner has suggested a number of ways in which
that might happen»

The detainer might affect: the conditions

of confinement on the intervening sentence:»

The delay might

36

jeopardise the opportunity for concurrent service of the tern,
or the delay might permit the loss of mitigating evidence.
We submit that the argument about effect on the
conditions of confinement must yield to this Court®s decision
in Meachum 7, Fano * which held that when prison officials have
discretion to choose the place and conditions of confinement*
•the due process clause does not require particular procedures
to be used in making that choice.

The choice itself does not

involve a legitimate claim of entitlement.
In the federal prison system it is true* as petitioner
t

contends * that the officials know whether there has been a
detainer* and in many cases they consider whether that detainer
should have an effect on their decision.

But the fact that a

detainer has been considered is no different front the fact in
Meachum that the prison officials considered whether the
prisoners there had committed arson or had been alleged to
commit arson* or might commit arson.
The question is not whether particular facts have
been considered in making the decision* the question is whether
there is a duty to respond to those facts in particular ways;
that is* whether there is a legitimate claim of entitlement to
have particular conditions of confinement.
the federal prison system.

There is none in

Petitioner has not contended that

there is. And we submit that there is no' liberty or property
interest from that source

37
The second source,, the one with which petitioner
opened the argument* is the argument that opportunities for
concurrant revocation* concurrent service of the revoked term
will be losto

We submit that that argument, is simply

fallacious? it is fallacious* as a matter of fact* and it
doesn’t help petitioner even if it’s true.
First* because of the dispositional review that is
now provided* the warrant can be dismissed and the detainer
released with or without an oral hearing.

The absence of an

oral hearing does not prevent concurrent service of th© term.
But* more importantly* after the intervening sentence
has expired, the Commission has a number of options available
to it* each of which will achieve* in practice* the equivalent
of concurrent service.
First* the Commission can decide simply not to revoke
parole* to withdraw the warrant* to treat it as if it had never
existed.

That achieves concurrent- service in practice.

It

can decide to revoke and grant immediate rs-parole* and that’s
provided by Section 4214(d)(5) of the Parole Commission Act,
This has much the same effect* but we understand that
petitioner's objection to -the revocation and the immediate reparole is that it will extend the length of the time as a
parolee and -chafe -there ar® some ancillary restrictions during
that extended time,
Th© Parol® Commission has a statutory device to deal

38

with that»

Section 4211 of the new Parole Commission Act says

that tli© Commission can* on its own motion* terminate its
supervision over fch© parolee at any time»

So that although his

time as a parolee might be extended by a ravocation and
immediate re-parole* the Commission has the discretion under
4211 to terminate that supervision* achieving concurrency or
parti.al concurrency retroactively,,
QUESTIONs Well* Mr. Easterhrook* you refer to the new
Parole Act.

I understood it was your opponent's contention that

the new Parol® Act didn't have any application to this case
because her client was not. able to take advantage of it if the
old procedures were constitutional.
MR. EASTERBROOK; The new Act both applies and does not
apply to thi3 case.

Under the new Act it is not possible for

petitioner to seek a reopening of decisions that were already
made under the old procedures.

But the question of whether

petitiioner will be released on parole after the end of his
convictions for murder and manslaughter will be decided by
procedures under the n@w Parole Act* and that's why we are
relying on the provisions of the new Parols Act* to show what
options the Commission will have at its disposal when, a year
from now* petitioner is released from his current sentence by
virtue of good time.
QUESTION: So* when you refer to a provision of the new
Parole Act in your argument* you are referring to a provision

39
that, would have some applicability, in your view , to the
petitioner?
MR» EASTERBROOK:

Yes- it would, Your Honor.

The Commission's next option is an option set up by
28 C.F.R. 2.52(c) (2), which we reprint at page 19a to the
Appendix to our brief.
It says that the Commission can revoke but, and I
quote, ''may” decide to forfeit the intervening time served
before and during the .intervening conviction.
The Commission interprets this as allowing partial
concurrent revocation, retroactively.

And I don't think that

there is any reason to be worried about petitioner's argument
that the Parole Commission does not have that option, when the
Parole Commission itself believes that it loss, and will act
as though it does.
QUESTION*

But it could allow bath, either partial

or total concurrence, could it not?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, it could.

That is, it could allow total concurrence

by simply a decision that they would not revoke parole at all.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: That might even eliminate the second
hearing.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

They would probably have a second

hearing to determine which of the courses they would follow, and

40

that would be a full oral adversarial hearing.
QUESTION; But under Morrissey , which will no longer
b© applicable after

it will be superseded, at least, by the

new Act, when this occurs.

Under Morrissey, the first prelimin-

ary hearing night result in a determination not to have a second
hearing at all? would it not?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It might, if it were determined that

there is no probable cause.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Hypothetically, they might have

gotten the wrong man, a person with, the same name, or that the
violation of parole was so minimal that it wasn't significant.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

That's right, Your Honor.

In this case, petitioner would be on much sounder
ground, asking for an immediate oral hearing, if petitioner
were contending -that he was not the person who was convicted
of murder and manslaughter in 1971 in Arizona.

But that

argument has never been made.
Finally, petitioner has sn argvprent that mitigating
evidence might be lost in the interim, .«nci that this will
affect the Commission's ultimate decision.
But petitioner has never contended that he has any
such evidence.

His habeas corpus pleading, in the district court

in this case contended that the reason for requiring a prompt
hearing was to have the opportunity for concurrent service of
the revoked sentence.

41
Moreover* the Commission has rules that will allow
him to have an oral hearing if he were to make a persuasive
claim that he has mitigating evidence* that it might affect
their decision* and that it might be lost®

But petitioner has

never made a claim of that sort* either in his pleadings or
at any later stage.
And the claim that evidence might dissipate* in some
cases is, we submit, not enough to require an oral hearing in
every case.
Even in cases decided under the speedy trial clause
of the Sixth Amendment, in which dissipation of evidence, and
in which the possibility of prejudices to the defense, is a
pressing if not overriding concern.

The possibility that

evidence will dissipate is not sufficient.

Dissipation of

evidence, prejudice to -the defense, is a matter of proof, at a
v

very minimum it's a matter of claim, and it!s not sufficient to
require a hearing in every case, that there might b® prejudice
in soma cases.
If that happens, there will be time enough to correct
it when it occurs.
Finally, I turn to petitioner's argument that the
procedures now used by the Parol© Commission ar® inadequate ‘bo
guard against these kinds of intervening losses, the loss of the
possibility of concurrent revocation, the loss of mitigating
evidence during the interim, and so on.

42
We think that the argument has little to recommend it.
The Commission conducts a full file review and sets an. oral
hearing whenever it appears that one would be useful.
Petitioner's argument, thus, quickly boils down to the
argument that there must be a hearing in every case, even when
it does not seem likely to serve a useful purpose in a particular
case.
We start, in this regard, from the proposition that if
a parolee is convicted of another crime while on parole, then
revocation of parole, to begin after the intervening sentence,
is the ordinary disposition.

The Parole Commission's rules so

provide, and that's Rule 2.47(c), which we have reprinted at
page 13a of our brief.
What the Commission does is establish a file review
and essentially to require the parolee 'to bear the initial
burden of showing -that he should receive exceptional treatment
and that an oral hearing, as opposed to a paper file review,
is necessary in order to determine whether that is so.
We think that there can be no doubt that that comports
with the due process clause, even to the

extent something is

required in the interim.
The interests involved for the parolee are slight.
As I have pointed out, the fact of incarceration itself is not
at stake, because that was debarmined by the 1971 murder
conviction. The Parol© Commission has ampla discretion to allow

43
concurrent revocation retroactively,, or partial concurrent
revocation.
And it is unlikely that someone who has been
convicted of murder will show that he's entitled to exceptional
treatment»
But, putting that

aside, it’s clear that whatever

procedures the Parole Commission may use, there's no chance of
an erroneous decision.

The possibility of error was extinguished

by the conviction for murder.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Easterbrook, let me just raise a

question here, you may have answered it, but I want to be sure
I understand your answer.
One of their arguments, as I gather it, is that,under
existing rules, if there had been an immediate revocation
hearing, and presumably there would have been revocation, then
•the sentences would have baen required -bo run concurrently.
And h@ has automatically lost that benefit by -the delay.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, that’s not true.

That

question was raised in Zerost v. Kidwell, a decision at 304 U.S.,
which is cited in our brief.

An identical argument was made

arAd this Court unanimously rejected it.

After a prompt

intervening hearing, there is no need for a concurrent revoca­
tion.
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't under Justice Stevens'

question to be quite that, whether or not there was a need for

44
it*

But whether or not, in factf that is what happens*
MR» EASTERBROOK;

Your Honor,

it’s not in fact what

happens.

,

My unders tan ding

and we* ve been informed by the

Parole. Commission, is that when an oral dispositional hearing
is held during the intervening conviction, during -the term of
the intervening conviction, the usual disposition is to make
no disposition.

The Commission takes the evidence that the

parolee has to offer and makes no decision.
In some cases it makes a decision to lift the v/arrant
and to lift the detainer; in other cases it makes a decision
to revoke concurrently, on the spot; but in most cases it makes
no decision at all.
And the court that has discussed this problem mos t
thoroughly, the Court of Appeals in Jones y* Johnston, has
concluded that -there is no constitutional or statutory obstacle
to having the hearing and making no decision.

And that, we

believe, is what the Commission will continue to do.
QUESTION;

Mr. Easterbrook, I don’t feel you have

quits answered the question.

I want to be sure I have it.

Assuming that they do have a prompt hearing and make
a prompt decision to revoke, then your opponent says that the
rules provide that in that eventuality the sentence will be
concurrent.

Is your opponent correct or not?

MR. EASTERBROOK;

My opponent is not correct. Your

45

Honor.

They can make a prompt, decision to revoke and, at the

time, make the decision that the revocation will begin
after the conclusion of the intervening sentence.
QUESTION; The revocation will begin or the — I see.
MR. EAS TE RB ROOK:

That the time served as a parol©

violator will begin after the intervening sentence.
QUESTION s

I see.

MR. EASTERBRQOK;

The last point I want to make is

the point that it’s usually thought that due process procedures
are necessary to prevent or to reduce the risk of erroneous
decision-making.

That is the typology this Court set up in

Mathews v. Eldridge.
But in a case lik© this, we think, there is no
possibility of erroneous decision-making.
An exercise of discretion may be unwise, it may be
uninformed, it would not be erroneous.
QUESTION;

What would happen if the man had bean

pardoned?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

Excuse me, Your Honor?

If this

man had been pardoned?
QUESTION;

What would happen if this man had been

pardoned, and nobody had notified the Board?
That would have been a mistake then, wouldn't it?
MR. EASTERBROOK;
a mistake

Yes, Your Honor, it might hav© been

46

QUESTION?

So you can’t be sure that there’s no way

to hav© a mistake.
MR. EASTERBRGOK;

Your Honor,, there is no way that

the possibility of error can be excluded on suppositions of
that sort.

But* as the Court said in Mathews v. Eldridge. the

possibility* that kind of remote possibility of error in a few
cases is not sufficient to call for hearings in every case.
Thank you very much.

We submit that the judgment

should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you* Mr. Easterbrook.
Mrs. Bamberger* do you, have something more?

You

have five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. PHYLIS SKLQOT BAMBERGER,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. BAMBERGER;

Yes, Your Honor.

The government refers to its new regulation to say
that they can give partial retroactive concurrency.

I think

the government misconstrues the words of tie regulation, if
not the intent.

It relatas to street time.

Under the statute

a parolee who violates by anything but a new conviction or a
new crime is entitled to receive credit for the time that he
has served while on parol©.
Th© exception is for a parolee who violates the parol©
by the commission of the new crime,he loses his street time.
And that section relates directly to -the loss of street time.

47

The question of retroactive concurrency;, partial
retroactive concurrency, I think, is answered by 4214(d), which
is the relief provision of the new statute, which applies to
the hearing which is granted at the end of the intervening
sentence»

And it lists five dispositions which til© Board might

make at a hearing granted at that time.
And partial retroactive concurrency is not one of
them,
Th© Board’s own regulation, Section 2,52, does not
include that as a possible remedy,
I think th© government misconstrues 'the decision in
Zerbst,

In Zarbst, the petitioners war© requesting that the

Parol© Board must mak© the sentences run concurrently.

We’re

not urging -that they must do so, we’re urging -that they, in the
situation where they may do so, there must be a due process
proceeding, because th© Board must

because that is a liberty

interest which he currently possesses,
Now, I think —
QUESTION:

Well, won’t that due process hearing occur

when, as, and if the parol© is revoked?
MRS, BAMBERGER;

Not at the end, Your-Honor, because ~~

well, the hearing will occur at the end, but he will be harmed
because of the effect of the detainer ~ because of the
modification of the parole conditions, which result from the
detainer while he is in th© institution, ar.d from the loss of

43
concurrency .
Now , getting to the government.5 s interpretati on —QUESTION;

But perhaps they will declare it? perhaps

•the action will result in its being concurrent.

How can you

predict that now?
MRS. BAMBERGER; Well, the government's position is
that the total withdrawal of the detainer and the warrant at
the end of the intervening sentence, where the new crime is
serious, is not likely to occur.

But what is more likely to

occur is the possibility of concurrency , v/here the violator
doesn't get everything but h© gets something. And the inability
to give the partial retroactive concurrency deprives the
parolee of that intermediate dispositional aspect, which the
Commission can grant.
I -think the government misconstrues the last — that
line in Morrissey and Gagnon which, in Morrissey, it relies on.
That section relates to those jurisdictions in which there is
no discretion, where there is a violation of parole, not to
revoke.

In other words, as in Tennessee, where the sentences

must be served concurrently on a finding of violation, that
sentence in Morrissey would apply.

They would not need to give

a hearing on the dispositional aspect of the case.
But where there is a discretion, Morrissey in no fewer
than three .places, at 480, 484, 488, and at Gagnon in 411 at
exjsazz.-vd&iuvrTtMZr-.-z:

790, say that where there is this discretion, the hearing

49

must be given„

And it's interesting to note that in Gagnon

the violation was admitted by the parolee»
committed the burglary»

He said he had

And so the Court# with that fact,

still viewed the dual aspect of the process very important»
QUESTION;

Has he not admitted it here?

MRS» BAMBERGER;

Oh# yes# we®re not disputing that

he has admitted it, But we're saying that even where he admits
it, th@ dispositional ph&3© is still critical.

And the

government attempts to distinguish Morrissey and Gagnon# saying
that they don’t apply where the parolee has admitted the
violation.

And they are hardly distinguishable if that fact

existed in those very cases.
The government asserts her® that we urge that an oral
hearing is required.
Now# it is our position that 'the old Board's rules,
which did not provide for notice, disclosure of -the file, any
kind of representation, or any statement cf the facts or
reasons , does not comport with Morrissey,

I f the Court finds

that is true, then the parolee in this case# the petitioner,
would be entitled to a new hearing at the present time.
Now, under the new rules# he would be entitled to more
than hs would have been entitled to then.

And it is our

position teat perhaps in some situations an oral hearing would
not be required# but teat -this is not a decision which the
Court must make now
