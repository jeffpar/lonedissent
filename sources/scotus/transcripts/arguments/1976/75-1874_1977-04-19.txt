CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in T5^Q7^3 David L. Jones against North Carolina Prisoners'
Labor Union»
Mr, Safron.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAP RON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAFRON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before this Court upon direct appeal
from a three-judge district court sitting in the Eastern
District of North Carolina holding that the North Carolina
Department of Correction, under its then announced policies,
could not prohibit the formation and operation of the North
Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union within the facilities of the
North Carolina Department of Correction.
The three-judge court, paying lip service to the
opinion of this Court iij Pell y, Procunier, cites Pell and
then immediately proceeds to emasculate the decision In Pell,
subvert the holding of this Court in Pell and require the
North Carolina Department of Correction to provide resources
to the North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union and all other
organizations euqually neutrally applied.
We sought a stay of that order.
denied a stay.

The District Court

We sought a stay from this Court and a stay was

4
denied from this Court.
As a result of the denial of stays, it became
necessary for the Department of Correction to issue regulations
pursuant to the opinion of the three-judge court.

Those regu­

lations are printed in the Respondent's brief, I believe, on
page l6o

However, the Respondent, in printing these regula­

tions, has failed to provide one point.
These regulations provide — The purpose of these
rules is to regulate the activities of organized inmate groups,
not sponsored by the Department of Correction, in compliance
with —
Your Honor, I am reading right now from our
regulations.

Thus isn't indicated in the brief.

"The purpose of these rules is to regulate the
activities of organized inmate groups, not sponsored by the
Department of Correction, in compliance with the order issued
by the three-judge panel in North Caro11na Prisoners' Labor
Union v. Jones, presently being reviewed by the United States
Supreme Court.
"The Department of Correction reserves the right
to amend these rules if that Court modifies the decision of the
lower court."
In this case, the Department of Correction sought to
take a moderate position.

The three-judge court acknowledges

the Department sought to take a moderate position.

The three-

5
judge court recognizes and admits that the correctional
officials have real and sincere doubts about this organization
and fears concerning the results such an organization might
bringo

Yet, the three-judge court disregarded those fears.
Now, we have published regulations.

Other organiza­

tions have gone with those regulations and are functioning.
The Prisoners® Labor Union refused to comply.

They filed

their original self-serving declaration when they first formed
themselves, which was insufficient.

When we said it was in­

sufficient, they sought an order to hold the correctional
officials in contempt.
There was, as a result, an extensive plenary hearing.
QUESTION:
MR0 SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

This is all holding?
This is post — And I point out —
Well, what does it bear on?
Well, we have issued these regulations

because we could not get a stay.

The court, at the contempt

hearing,found that the petition to hold the defendant in
contempt was sought with-the sole intent to harass the
defendants, the correctional officials and that we have done
everything required of us.
The Prisoners ® Labor Union does not currently exist,
although under the rules if they would properly apply, they
could exist.

Anything that they say concerning any benefits

the correctional system, has derived is mere puffing on their

6
part.
According fco the three-judge court, we opened the
doors „

We sponsored and recognized the Jaycees»

It's an

organization, of course, with national roots in outside
society»

It has served and has been determined to serve

worthwhile rehabilitative goals of the Department of Correction»
But we have opened the door and the three-judge court says the
Fourteenth Amendment now denies us the opportunity to pick and
choose among those organizations that can come in»
We have sponsored and worked with the Alcoholics
Anonymous, obviously, an organization with outside organization
which serves valid rehabilitative purposes»
At our youth facility, we have the Boy Scouts*

Once

again, an organization that serves valid rehabilitative purposes
and has good solid roots in society»
But, because we have brought in the AA, because we
have brought in the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts, now the threejudge court says we can no longer pick and choose among those
organizations which utilize our resources, which utilize our
time, and we must treat them all alike*

And if we let someone

come in from AA or the Boy Scouts from the outside, from free
society, or the Jaycees, we must let someone come in from the
Prisoners' Labor Union»
If we permit the Jaycees to send in bundles of
publications for distribution to their members, we must permit

7
the Prisoners" labor Union to send in bundles,
I would submit that the three^judge court has not
properly read the decision of this Court in Ross v, Moffxtt.
There are, obviously, limits beyond which the Fourteenth
Amendment cannot be stretched without breaking.

And in this

case, I submit, the Fourteenth Amendment has been broken
asunder.
Furthermore, this Court announced quite clearly in
Pell va Procunier the basis under which correctional officials
can pick and choose among various goals, and recognized the
valid fears of correctional officials.
In this case, among those fears, Is concerted action.
Because even if the intent of this union is peaceable,-1 submit
that common sense leads us to a conclusion that if their
peaceable demands are not met that inmates, prisoners who have?
already demonstrated an inability to live within the law and
quite often resort to violence as a means of determining their
own ends, will of necessity resort to violence,
QUESTION:

Well, the District Court said there would

be time enough, at that point, to grant your relief,and
certainly indicated it would grant relief if that happened.
MR» SAPROM:

Your Honor, must the Department of

Correction await a catastrophic incident —*
QUESTION:
argue

That's, what we are waiting to hear you

8
MRo SAFRON:

Must we avjait a catastrophic incident

before there is a factual record which will support the fears
and concerns of correctional officials?

Must men be killed

and injured, must property be burned before our fears have any
validity?

Must inmates be given the opportunity to use our

facilities, our limited resources, must they be allowed to
coalesce into formal organizations which if they said, "We
are going to strike tomorrow and we have seventy-seven units
in North Carolina,5' there would be no way for, the State to
respond?
We saw a horrible riot occur in 1968 when the socalled "Bulls of the Yard" had a very profitable hobby shop
business going, where some of them were making so much money
that the Internal Revenue Service brought suit for failure to
pay taxes.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

This was in your own institutions?
Yes, sir.

And when that occurred —

Could that have been done without the

cooperation of officials within the institution?

Well, could they have had it without the

cooperation of the officials?

QUESTION:

In the first instance?

MR. SAPRON:

In the first instance?

If Your Honor please* I don't really believe
cooperation is needed.

The Inmate peer structure is such

that cooperation of the officials isn't required,
QUESTION:

How could a man build up that kind of

an institution vjifchln a prison walls without the officials
knowing about it?
MR» SAPRON:

know about it* and in our situation ■»QUESTION:
MR. SAPRON:

They did know about it.
«<*• when a new administration came into

being an attempt was made to withdraw the power and riots
occurred„
Now* we are quite familiar with the riots which
occurred at Walpole as a result of the introduction there of
the National Prisoners Reform Association.

There is a book

which Is part of the record* "In Constant Fear*" in which an
inmate there tells how it was the introduction of the National
Prisoners Reform Association which was the catalyst for the
violence that occurred as the hardened* long'^tdrm inmates
sought to take control of the institution,
The deposition of Harden Mullins of Rhode Island
is part of the record in this case.

The deposition of Warden

Mullins is a horror story of what can happen in an institution.

10
When he arrived there tsasn'fe a window left in that entire
institution.
The National Guard and State Pol3.ce were called down
and for five to six months it was necessary for them to run
that institution to restore law and order.
And; as Warden Mullins tells* when you have various
diverse groups within an institution — and in that case the
Youth Commission trying to break away from the leadership of
the reform association* the older* hard-core Mafia types* all
of a sudden the members of the Youth Commission disbelieving
how hard and violent the older inmates could be* in one
instance were almost wiped out.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General* could I ask you two

questions?
Is there anything in the District Court 8s' findings
relating to the problem of the older inmates?
MR. SAPRQN:
QUESTION:

No* Your Honor, there isnct.
Is there anything on the record on that

subject?

Let me ask you a second question,»

I had

two questions *
Do you dispute the right of the prisoners to form a
union?
MR. SAP ROM;
QUESTION:

Your Honor ««•
You seem to In Point One of your brief,

but the District Court said you did not*

Have you changed your

position or is it the same position?
MRo SAPRON;

No*

As I said in the beginning, we

took a moderate position.
QUESTION:

But did it include an objection to their

forming a union?
MR* SAPRON;
QUESTION:

Yes.
Then the District Court misstated ycur

position.
MR. SAPRON:

The reason we are before this Court,

the reason we are in the District Court is because the
regulations were promulgated which prohibited the formation
and operation of a prisoners® labor union within the walls of
the North Carolina Department of Correction,
One concession, which was a moderate point, because
we were concerned about First Amendment rights, is that the
North Carolina Prisoners" Labor Union, under the auspices of
one Robbie Turner, had an office in the City of Durham, and we
did not say inmates could not join the Prisoners" Labor Union*

12
We have

do

regulations saying you cannot be a member of the

Prisoners ' Labor Union or you cannot be a member of the Klu
Kins Klan or you cannot be a member of the Black Panthers.
We had no objection to inmates on a one-to-one
situation writing to Ms, Purner* to this outside off Iceland
being members of this outside organization.

We objected to

the formation* creation and implementation of concerted action
within the facilities of the Department of Correction* the
utilization of state resources and time and facilities and
manpower because we have not said —»
QUESTION:
on that?

Didn't the District Court agree with you

It said they have no right to form or belong to a

labor union for the purpose of taking concerted action to
force their demands upon prison administrators,
I don't know what you are disagreeing with that the
District Court

— with respect to what the District Court

ruled against you,
MR, SAFRGN:

The District Court's ultimate conclusion

is we must let them in or else stop all other organizations.
To control this group* we would have to throw out Jaycees,
AA, Boy Scouts* any other organization which the Department of
Correction has determined serves a beneficial rehabilitative
and penological need,
Now* we have not cried to interfere with the outside
organization.

Our interference* Your Honor* is with a concerted

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gelier,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S6 SELLER, ESQ,,,
FOR THE. UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As Mr. Safron has indicated, the District Court in

14
this case* has held that the State of North Carolina is re­
quired by the First Amendment to allow inmates in its penal
Institutions to solicit other inmates* orally or in writing*
for the purpose of encouraging membership In the North Carolina
Prisoners5 Labor Union* and must also permit its inmates to
receive outside correspondence and publications advocating
prison unionism®
In addition* the court below has ruled that the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires
the state to accord the prisoners5 union mass mailing and
meeting privileges within its correctional institutions to the
same extent that any other inmate organization enjoys such
operating privileges®
The United States believes that this decision is
incorrect and that the district court has intruded itself into
an area that should properly be left to the sound discretion
of correctional officials»
We believe* in addition* that if the lower court's
decision is upheld it may lead to serious breaches of prison
security and may impair efforts at inmate rehabilitation* as
well»
Now* legal principles that govern this ease are
clear»

Without question* the anti-union regulations of the

North Carolina Bureau of Corrections* like those of the Federal
Bureau of Prisons* restrict*to some extent* the associations!

15
liberties of prison inmates.
But this Court has emphasized,on a number of
occasions,that First Amendment rights are not absolute and
that such rights must be considered in light of the special
characteristics of the environment in which they are asserted.
Mow, in the prison environment,the controlling
standard was articulated three years ago in Fell v, Procunier,
There, in upholding state and federal regulations that erected
a blanket prohibition against face to face interviews of
prison inmates by representatives of the news media, the Court
stated that a prison inmate only retains those First Amendment
rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner
or with the legitimate penological considerations of the
correction system.

Challenges to prison restrictions that are

asserted to inhibit First Amendment rights, said the Court,
must be analyzed in terms of the legitimate policies and
goals of the correction system.

QUESTION:

Do you think that's critical of the

District Court's analysis of the Equal Protection argument?
MR, GELLER:

Yes, we do.

Certainly.

The District

Court, as we read the opinion, did not extend the First
Amendment discussion» or the Fourteenth Amendment as it
incorporates the First, so far as to say that the prisoners
have a First Amendment right to receive mass mailings or to
allow outsiders to come Into talk to them, but it held that
they had that right under the Fourteenth, the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the same extent that any
other inmate organization within North Carolina's prisons is
allowed to enjoy those rights.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Thank you.
We discussed at some length in our brief

the serious problems that may reasonably be anticipated in the
area of prisoner rehabilitation if inmate unions are allowed to
function within the prison system.
We have pointed out,and Appellees have not disputed,
that efforts to change the value system of individual prisoners
or to achieve inroads in the prison social structure would be
severely frustrated if correctional officials had to deal with,
or at least answer to, an inmate group with pervasive influence

18

throughout the prison.
I would like to limit my discussion here to the
potential impact of such prisoner groups upon an even more
important correctional goal.

One that this Court in Fell

termed central to all other institutional considerations* that
is,the Internal security of the prison facilities themselves.
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this case
involves a claim,by prison inmates, that they have a constitu­
tionally protected right to associate with other inmates and
to engage in concerted activity within the confines of a
prison.
Prisons are unlike any other institution In our
society.

They are closed communities of proven lawbreakers

under the constant and close supervision of a limited staff.
For obvious reasons, related both to the type of
people who constitute the inmate population and the conditions
under which they inevitably must live, the atmosphere in prisons
is frequently tense and volatile, having no counterpart in the
outside world.
In these circumstances, we believe, the presence of
any concerted activity among inmates is a cause for concern.
QUESTION:

What is the significance of Paragraph 1

of Page 30?
Whatever right of association of any prisoner is
derived from the First Amendment.

They have no right to form

19
or belong to a labor union for the purpose of taking concerted
action to force their demands upon prison administrators0
What's that mean?
MR» GELLER:

I think it means, Mr. Justice Brennan,

that the District Court acknowledged that if at some future
time —
QUESTION:

I know, but you've been saying that the

demand here is that they want, in a concerted fashion, to
assert certain rights as a prison labor union»
MR„ GELLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct»
Doesn't this say they don't have those

rights?
MR. GELLER:

It states that if at any time in the

future they begin to act as a group for the purpose of
engaging in acts that the state may legitimately prohibit,
the state, at that point, may move in.
We believe, as does the state —
QUESTION:

Is that what it says?

I thought it said

whatever right they may have, if any, they have no right to
form a labor union for the purpose of taking concerted action.
MR. GELLER:

I understand that, Mr. Justice Brennan,

but under the District Court's opinion, these collection of
inmates would be allowed to engage in the first step that we
believe would lead inevitably to concerted activity.

QUESTION;

Must that not be read with Paragraph 3»

2 and 3 on Page 32, Paragraph 3 saying, ’’The union and its
inmate members shall be accorded the privilege of holding
meetings generally under the same conditions as the Jaycees
and the Boy Scouts and the Alcoholics Anonymous."
MR* GELLER:

Well, that, of course, Mr.Chief Justice,

relates to the equal protection analysis.
QUESTION:

I am talking about the — whether ~~

from whatever source it derives the impact on the prison is
determined not by what's said in the opinion primarily, but
what's said on Page 32, under Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3«

That's

the order of the court.
MR. GELLER:

And that's incorporated in the judgment

which follows in Appendix B, that's correct*
I think, under the District Court's opinion, these
inmates have to be allowed to solicit other inmates.

They

have to be allowed to organise and coalesce into a group, and
they have to be allowed to engage in such concerted activities
as other inmate groups within the union, no matter how bene­
ficial the other inmates groups' purposes are allowed to enjoy*
' QUESTION:

And all this derives from the holding of

the court that although there is no constitutional right to
form a union, once they have been permitted to form a union and
invite

AA and the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Boy-

Scouts and others in, they must accord to this union precisely

21

the same privileges as are accorded to these other organiza­
tions, including meetings and concerted action within the
prison,
MR, GELLER:

The District Court has held that under

the Equal Protection Clause, Mr, Chief Justice, that's correct.
And we disagree with that.

Vie think that there are obviously

differences among inmate groups.
purposes.

Some have obvious beneficial

Inmate leaders don't attempt to speak for other

inmates in certain groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous,

In

fact, the overwhelming weight of authority among correctional
officials is that inmate groups should not be allowed to
function, but that these other groups of obvious beneficial
value should be allowed to function,
Noitf, there are a number of legitimate reasons, we
believe, for this concern on the part of correctional
officials.

One is that inmates, like people generally, tend

to behave with greater emotion and fewer inhibitions when
acting as part of a group.

Moreover, unlike the general

population, prisoners have the shared characteristic, as
Mr, Safron indicated, of having on one or more occasions
resorted to seriously illegal means to achieve their goals,

As I've explained, we think; that an

So organizing is .important?

MR. GELLER:

No, it's what the Impact is of what

we understand it, although there has been some fluctuation.
They plan to present grievances to prison officials about

QUESTION:

What's wrong with that?

MR* GELLER?

I think on an individualized basis it

is not wrong, and it certainly is to be encouraged.

state legitimately fears is that when they ban together for
this purpose they xvill always have the expressed.or the implied
power to use force if they don't gain their — gain what they
believe is their right»
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't they get together in the

yard and have a meeting in the corner of the yard?
MR» GELLER:

Obviously, there is a limit to
Couldn't they?

MR. GELLER: The question is, we believe, what
legitimate steps the prison officials are allowed to take at
the outset when the organization has announced what its goals
are.

Must it wait, as Mr. Safron has said, until these evils

actually come to pass, before it may take the first steps?
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, it seems to me, you rest

your response to Justice Marshall on the goals of the union
as being improper but the.District Court found that there was
no evidence tending to show that the inmates intend to operate
the union to hamper and interfere with the proper interests
of government.
So, if you are basing it on goals, it seems to me
the finding forecloses your argument.
MR. GELLER:

I don't think I can agree, Mr, Justice

25
Stevens,
First of all, this union has never operated within
the prison system in North Carolina.

So, although their

announced goals seem laudable, I think that, as this Court
acknowledged in Procunler v0 Martinez, the courts must defer
to the reasonably anticipated goals of the correctional
officials, as they perceive the inmate organization to operate
in the future.
But, secondly, I think we also have to take into
account that once this union becomes a fixture in the prison
system, it won’t be operated by these responsible outside
advocates of prison reform,

It will be operated by the

prisoners themselves.
Now, all of these goals -QUESTION:

Are there findings to that effect?

MR. GELLER:

I think that the Appellees do not deny

that these unions will be operated from within the prison.
QUESTION:

Are there findings to that effect?

MR. GELLER:

Well —

QUESTION:

I don’t think there are.

MR. GELLER:

Icm not certain that the bistrict

Court —»
QUESTION:

Should we decide the case on the basis

of the findings or should we do it de novo?
MR. GELLER:

No.

I think that the findings do

26

indicate the fact that this union is made up primarily of
prison inmates and that it is governed by democratic principles
and, therefore, I would assume that the majority vote would be
made up of prisoners rather than outsiders *
QUESTION:

In that respect, isn't it just like

Mr. Justice Marshall's AA?
Your difference, as I understand it, is in their
announced goals.
MRo GELLER;
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And the District Court found the

announced goals were harmless.
MR. GELLER:

The District Court did, but we think

that the District Court did not defer substantially to the
expert judgment of correctional'officials who should be able
to look at these goals —
QUESTION:

So you are asking us to set aside the

District Court findings.
MRo GELLER:

No.

Vie think that the District Court

findings are in clear violation of what this Court said in
Pell v. Procunier.

And in Procunler v. Martinez, the Court

said that unless the fears of correctional officials are
grossly exaggerated on the record, the Court must defer to
them.
Mow, we don't think that the court did that here.
We think that the court substituted its judgment in this case,

27

QUESTION:

You may be entirely right, but that's an

argument for the proposition that the findings are erroneous.
That's what you are arguing, I think.
MR. GELLER:

We don't think it is a question of

findings of fact, vie think it is a question of what legal
standard the District Court should bring to bear on the facts
in the particular case.

And we think that in this case it

gave absolutely no deference to the legitimate findings and
anticipated fears of the correctional officials.

And, after

all, it is the correctional officials who would have to deal
with any outbreaks, if they should occur.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, under the judgment, not the

opinion as a whole, but under the judgment if the state ex­
cluded all of these organizations, they would be in compliance
they wouldn't be in violation of the court's mandate, I
take it?
MR* GELLER:

They would not be in violation of the

equal protection aspects of the court's mandate, but the court
also said »- and it is the first paragraph on page 32

that

all inmates in the North Carolina prison system have a jiirst
Amendment right to solicit and invite other inmates to join the
union, and that's not dependant upon what other outside organi­
zations are allowed to do.
QUESTION:

And some of them conflict with their

finding that there was no right to join a union, do they not?

28

MR» GELLER:
QUEGTIQN:
MRo GELLER:

Well, I am not ~Three or four pages earlier.
The District Court explicitly stated

that it didn't have to reach that question because of what
it perceived to be certain concessions by the state, but the
state today — and we believe they are correct — disagrees
with those findings of the District Court.
QUESTION:

Is it not correct that in the District

Court the state acknowledged that there was a right to join a
union?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That's not correct, as we understand it.
That's what the District Court said.

The state acknowledged and Districts Court is -wrong there too
then.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

We believe it is wrong.
I thought that the District Court had

said that North Carolina allowed them to join a union, not that
North Carolina acknowledged the constitutional right to join
a union.
MR. GELLER:

That's correct.

North Carolina, we

think, is taking a very sensible position.

It realizes there

are some First Amendment interests on the part of prison in­
mates, so what it allows them to do is to engage in outside
correspondence with union members, to receive correspondence
from the union and to consider themselves union members,

29

because that doesn't raise any problems within the union.
It is only when they start to operate within the
union ~
QUESTION:

Within the prison,

MR. GELLER:

Within the prison, excuse me.

It is only when they operate within the prison, by
talking to other inmates, attempting to organize other inmates, that the state wants to step in.

It has no desire to

limit discussions it has with outsiders about union activity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN B. SMITH, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We represent the Appellee prisoners' union here.
The union is a prison reform and mutual self-help organization.
It is not a labor union, in the ordinary sense.

The union

does not claim and has not claimed any right to bargain, strike
or take any concerted disruptive action.
The union's objectives are to improve prison re­
habilitation programs, to establish community-based facilities,
such as halfway houses, to secure public support for reform
legislation and administrative measures, to litigate prison
rights issues, to act by democratic processes in a multi­
racial organization.

30

The union, contrary to the Solicitor General's
statement, has existed and has had activities.

There is a

period of six months in existence prior to the adoption of the
regulation in question, and then another twelve months exis­
tence subsequent to the District Court's decision.
Contrary to what Mr. Safron says, the union still
exists.

Indeed, newsletters were published within the last

couple of months.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is the certificate of incor­

poration of the union in the papers before us?
MR. SMITH:

It is a part of the record, if Your

Honor please.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Does it authorize collective bargaining?
North Carolina incorporation laws allow

incorporators to say, essentially, anything they want to in
their papers.

And there is no effort to review them and to

pass upon their adequacy.
But, to respond directly to Your Honor's question,
in Article 3 of the charter, the union does purport to say ~
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:
Your Honor please.

Where is that in the record?
It is not in the printed Appendix, if
It is simply a part of the record that

came up from the District Court.
I have an extra copy and I would be happy to leave
it with the clerk

31

But, bo respond to the question, it does purport to
claim a desire to act as a collective bargaining agent.
QUESTION:

That's certainly a declaration of intent,

is it not, of the organizers?
MR® SMITH:

Yes, on the other hand, it does not

claim any right to take concerted action that would be dis­
ruptive of the prisons.
QUESTION:

Well, you'd hardly state that if you had

that in mind, in your articles of incorporation, would you?
MR. SMITH:

Well, if Your Honor please, look at the

unionized employees of |the Federal Government.
I

They have no

*

right to strike or take Illegal concerted action, yet
virtually every agency is unionized.

I think you can have all

different varieties of unions.
QUESTION:

Bid you hear about the strikes in New

York and San Francisco?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
of the union?

Yes, sir.
May I ask you, also, about the purposes

Is it a fact, as stated in your opponent's brief,

that after this suit was filed the union newspaper stated that
the prisoners should be encouraged to organize for the right
to collectively bargain for better conditions?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Did I understand you, at the beginning of

your argument, to say that there is no purpose of the union to

32

bargain collectively?
MR. SMITH:

The union realizes that that purpose is

illegal under North Carolina law, and unless and —
QUESTION:

Because of this suit you've changed basic

objectives?
MR» SMITH:

No, ^our Honor.

One of the announced purposes of the union is to
secure favorable legislation and one reform, one legislative
reform the union would desire would be to allow prisoners to
collectively bargain in North Carolina.

I must say not a very

hopeful and not a very probable purpose, but nonetheless that
would be the way they would go about it.
They realize currently that even state employees are
precluded from collective bargaining in North Carolina.

So

the purpose would await legislative reform, if ever.
But there is no intent to proceed unlawfully and
to violate the state's laws in that regard, nor can that be
gleaned from any of the papers in the record or from any of
the evidence offered in court.
The union's activities in the first six months before
the ban came into effect included the publication of newsletters,
the recruitment of 2200 members, roughly one out of every six
or seven Inmates in North Carolina Department of Correction
became a member.
Some modest alterations in correctional procedure

33
were claimed by the union, getting hot showers at one unit,
additional clothing and new linen in another,,
The record indicates, without any rebutting evidence,
that the union defused certain racial incidents at Central
Prison and brought about a degree of racial harmony there,
thafc the personal responsibility of the members was enhanced
through the democratic processes of the union and that the
union helped to build self-reliance among its members.
Now, since the District Court judgment on May 12,
r.

'76, another twelve mqnths of existence, I don’t feel at
liberty to depart from the record and discuss what has
happened, except to say that the union does exist and that it
does publish newsletters, contrary to Mr, Safron’s assertions,
and there is in the record the regulation that the Department
of Correction adopted pursuant to the District Court’s opinion.
The regulation applies neutrally to all organizations
of inmates within the prisons.

It imposes what we concede are

legitimate and constitutional time, place and manner restric­
tions, such as a maximum of 25 people attending the meetings,
and holding meetings only if adequate supervision is available.
The regulation of March 26, 1975^ at issue here, on
its face, prohibits solicitation of membership, denies the
use of departmental property to the union and excludes outside
organizers „
In addition, as applied, from the record, we learn

34
that the regulation banned the bulk mailing of newsletters
by the union*

Also, the regulation banned the circulation of

any written material that could be deemed a channel for
solicitation,.

So that we must regard any discussion of

benefits, purposes or even existence of the union as being
subject to that ban,
QUESTION:

These regulations you were just referring

to, Mr* Smith, were the ones that were challenged in the
District Court, not the ones that were issued after the
District Court judgment?
MR* SMITH:

That is correct.

I am referring to the

March 26, 1975,. regulations which are in issue.
Many individual newsletters and items of corres­
pondence were interdicted and sent back to their senders or
destroyed, including correspondence from persons outside the
Correction Department, in direct defiance of the standards
announced by —
QUESTION:

Do you think the union should be able to

solicit authorizations from prisoners for the union to act as
collective bargaining representative?
MR* SMITH:

If Your Honor please, I feel that that

has an element of misrepresentation to it because they are
not capable, under our law, of acting —
QUESTION:
MR* SMITH:

How about my question?
.1 should think it x^ould be permissible

35
for the Department of Correction to say* "No,

You may solicit

memberships, but, please, don't represent that you are a
collective bargaining agent, because you are not,"
QUESTION:

Well, the union did that, didn't it?

MR, SMITH:

The union did that,

QUESTION:

In its newspaper all the time, didn't

it?
MR, SMITH:

Well, it did that in its newspaper once

or twice.
But, in any event, the state's: response to that- was
too broad.

The state went too far.

"Don't misrepresent."

The 3tate didn't say,

The state said, "Don't solicit in any

form or manner."
And we submit, as the District Court properly
decided, that this was an over broad stifling of the First
Amendment rights„
QUESTION:

Would you say you would have the same

reaction to forbidding solicitation by prisoners, themselves?
MR, SMITH:

I think it would be in defiance of the

First Amendment to prohibit solicitation by the prisoners to
join the union.
QUESTION:

Just like it would be, you assert, for

outsiders to solicit, either by mail or by visitation?
MR, SMITH:

The regulations, If Your Honor please,

do not say that outsiders could not solicit.

36
QUESTION:

Exactly*

Then It doesn't forbid them

from soliciting for membership by visitation, does it?
MR* SMITH:

Yes, that ivas done because —

MR. SMITH:

Oh, no.

I think we would Insist, or

would wish to insist upon prisoners having the right to
solicit other prisoners to join the organization.
QUESTION:

So, you say you would not be satisfied

with just permission for outside solicitation.
MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

No, we think that the

First Amendment right of association goes broader than that.
QUESTION:

(inaudible)

-- outside organizers come

in and solicit?
MR. SMITH:

Well, this gets into the equal

to have outside organizers only to the same extent that other
organizations , similarly situated and with similar goals and
similar characteristics, are permitted to do0
QUESTION:

Do you think the prison administrators

can make their own value judgments on the purposes and the
qualifications of these outside groups coming in to carry out
activity?
MR„ SMITH:

Yes, sir, and when challenged under the

Constitution, we think they have to support them with valid
reasons' and seme evidence»
QUESTION:

But you agree with, I think, Mr» Geller

suggested in response to a question I put, that if they just
excluded everybody then that would be a compliance with —
it would not be a violation of this judgment?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think there are some freedom of

association principles involved here that could not be easily

resolved by simply excluding everybody.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't the District Court cast it

precisely on terms that the so-called union must have the
same rights, measured by the same dimensions and boundaries as
these other public organizations?

opinion, the solicitation of members was grounded upon right
of association principles.

According to Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of 32

of the Jurisdictional Statement, that last part of the judgment?
MR, SMITH:

I think Paragraph 1, If Your Honor please,

right of association judgment,
I think the second clause of Paragraph 1 and
Paragraphs 2 and 3 are grounded upon the Equal Protection
Clause,

opinion is hardly compatible with the first clause, Is it?

Now* if the union is going around

What about the Alcoholics Anonymous?

Yes*
And you really think that sort:of goal is

analogous to the goals of Jaycee state get~oufc~the*»vofce
movements, and the like, really analogous to what a union has

Sufficiently analogous to invoke equal

interested in a lot of legislation that is of importance to
them, just like the Sierra Club does, like any other interest

I think that Your Honor is correct in saying that
the Jaycees are perhaps broader than some interest groups,
but the relative breadth or narrowness cf the interest group,
I don't think, should be constitutionally determinative of

Yes, Your Honor.

There was a grant, I think, of $1,000 from the AFL-CXC,

That is correct.

It doesn't go beyond

the state.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Was it organized in a prison or outside?
It was organized within a prison, working

with outside interested people.
QUESTION:

So it has no real track record, has it?

Well, District Court looked at what it

had done and determined that no indication of any wrong doing

MRa SMITH:

Well, we think the record satisfactorily

establishes that, and, of course, as to the post-judgment
experience, that is not within the record, but we are satis­
fied that if ever that should be examined there would be no
indication of any harm to any valid correctional interest.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L» SAFRON, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR» SAFRON:

Yes, Your Honor,

First of all, I would like to point out that in our
memorandum in the District Court this is what we said: Page
2 of the memorandum in the rec ord;
"Apparently, the Plaintiff"(that?s the labor union)
"is not seeking to establish a National Labor Relations Board

56
type of labor union in the prison system."
That was our statement.

We went on to say,more

accurately, that they want to form as an organized group of
elected representatives of inmates within the prison to meet
together and to take their proposals, criticisms, suggestions,
and the like, to the administration,
That is what we said in there.
Number two, we never have — Let me phrase it this
way:

Our situation vis«a-vis the union, with its office

located in Durham, is that inmates — and we took that
moderate position
organization.

could join this organization, outside

And that's what I want to emphasize.

We never

denied their right to join an outside organization, as we have
never denied the right of the inmates to join any organization
of their choice.

We couldn't do it.

We couldn't perform

lobotomies on them.
Now, these are copies of various newsletters which
they published, one of which is attached- to the complaint which
is a part of the record in this case.

That tells how an

organizer came from California to attempt to organize the
North Carolina Department of Correction.
I submit that this is part of a national group.
Every one of their newsletters contains the same
authorization for representation for collective bargaining.
That's — The one that's in the record contains that.

The ones

57
vjhieh were published subsequent contain that.
QUESTION:

Other than the contribution of the AFL-

CXO, is there anything in the record about a linkage between
formal organized labor unions?
MRs SAFRON:
QUESTION:

No* Your Honor, that is the only.
But there is nothing unusual about the

AFL-CIO contributing to correctional activities, is there?
MR0 SAFRON:

I can't answer that, Your Honor.

I

really don't know.
Now* I'd like to say this:

That the design of our

response in this case is based upon Paka v. Mans on, the
decision of the .District Court for Connecticut.

That was our

basis for response and we followed the Paka holding almost
verbatim.

I would submit that Paka is an excellent discussion

of the applicable law in this case.

It is well thought out.

Now, the three-judge court never even mentions Paka,
just disregards Paka, as if the decision doesn't exist.
Now, as far as alternatives, under Pell v. Procunler,
In North Carolina, these prisoners are not held in outer

Now, I would submit further, under Pell, the "Big

QUESTION:

Would you deny them the right to join

the AA unit?
MR, SAFRON:

No, Your Honor, but the AA unit has

outside representatives, members of society who have- proven
their worth in the outside community and have come in to lend
their assistance to helping the inmates become rehabilitated
and return to society.
That's the difference here.

These outside Individuals

are out to serve a social good.

And I would submit, and all the cases show, that
there has, in fact, been an attempt, nationally, for these
inmates to organize together.

the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
