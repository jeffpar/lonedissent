ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. WEILL, ESO.,
i

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WEILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court:
This case is on appeal from the Illinois Supreme
Court and concerns the question of whether the Illinois
intestate succession statute, which excludes illeqitimate
children from inheriting from their fathers, but grants
such inheritance rights to all legitimate children, violates
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
Beta Mona Trimble was born in 1870.
were not married.

Her parents

Beta and her parents lived together, and

she was supported by her father pursuant to an Illinois
paternity adjudication and court order.
In 1574 , when Beta "’rimble was three and a half
I

years old, her father, Bherman Gordon, died at the acre of 28,
the victim of a homicide.

He left no will, and no surviving
}

spouse.

Beta is his only child.

/

Under the Illinois Probate Act, legitimate children
inherit from either parent in intestacy.

The illegitimate

4
child, on the other hand, will inherit from his or her mother,
but is not the heir of an intestate father.
Pursuant to this statute, the probate court entered
aii order declaring Sherman Gordon’s heirs to be his parents,
siblings and a half brother.

The court rejecter! the challencre

to the constitutionality of the statute.
The Illinois Supreme Caurt granted leave to appeal
directly to the Trimbles, and the Illinois Supreme Court then
affirmed the probate court’s decision.

There was no written

opinion, since the court held that its decision four months
earlier in the case of In re estate of Karas was dispositive.
In addition to fully briefing their own case, the Trimbles
had filed an amicus curiae brief in the Karas case.
QUESTION:
MR. WEILL:
QUESTIO?!:

Mr. Weill —
Yes, sir.
— was there any impediment to either

of the parents marrying?
MR. WEILL:
QUESTION:

Mo, there was none that we know.
And there was a paternity suit here,

wasn't there?
MR. WEILL:

Yes, there was a paternity suit

adj udication.
QUESTION:

And what prompted that?' Was that a

friendly suit, or an unfriendly one, or ~~ ?
MR. WEILL:

At some point, Mrs. Trimble — Ms.

5
Trimbl-e may have been on public aid, anci it would have been
a public aid suit,

The public aid department is required unde:

federal law, whenever anybody is on ADC, to establish paternit'
and bring a suit for support.
OtrnSTION:

Dell, what this lawsuit nets down to

then is a litigation between the child and the other blood
relatives of the decedent, correct?
MR. WEILL:

That’s correct.

But it is a auestion of

whether a state which rrives inheritance rinhts to children
generally —■
QUESTIO?!:
MR. WEILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MEILL:

I know.
— can exclude illegitimate children.
But this is what it amounts to, isn't it?
Yes, that's correct.

This Court has ruled in recent years, in several
cases, that legitimate children and illegitimate children
whose paternity have been established, are considered to
be identically situated,

The statute at issue here dis­

criminates because it denies to illegitimate children the
state-created inheritance right, which is accorded to children
generally.
This discrimination is unconstitutional under any
standard of review, since it does not bear the renotest
rational relationship to any legitimate state interests.
There have been four suggestions made by‘either

6
the Illinois Supreme Court, or by appellees here, as to —
QUESTION:

I take it, Mr. Weill, from your comment

just now, you concade that the rationality standard applies?
MR. PRILL:

Pc, we don't concede that.

Pe still

believe that strict scrutiny, or some form of heiahtened
scrutiny, is potentially applicable.

Pe believe that because

illegitimate children bear c\ll or most of the traditional
indicia of suspectness, they've been historically discriminated
against, they're a discreet and insxilar minority, that some
kind of heightened scrutiny is applicable.

QUESTI0T7:

i thought you said that under anv

standard of rationality.
MR. PRILL:

Well, we said under any standard of

equal protection review, the statute must fall.

The

statute, because there is no rational basis whatsoever, the
Court need not reach the question of a higher level of scrutiny.
QUESTION:

How do you reconcile your answer to

Justice Blackmun’s question with ?1acthews against Lucas
decided last term?
MR. WRTLL:

Pell, the Lucas case did not concern

a total exclusion of illegitimate children.

The Lucas

case found the statute to be very quote carefully tuned to
the needs and considerations of including illegitimate
children.

It's not a total exclusion like this is.
QUESTION:

Rut it differentiated illegitimate from

7
legitimate children, didn't it?
MR. WEILL:

Yes, only marginally, and only when

there was no significant evidence of pre-existing support
or paternity adjudication.

Where, however, the statute

just blanketly excludes illegitimate children, we believe
that some form of heightened scrutiny is appropriate.

And

Lucas is not —
QUESTION:

There isn't a blanket exclusion here is

there, Mr. Weill?
MR. WEILL:

Yes, to the degree that illegitimate

children cannot inherit from their fathers in intestacy,
the state has created the total exclusion of them.
QUESTION:

Well, not — isn't there something —

you mean there — what if the parents marry?
MR. WEILL:

If the parents marry and the father

acknowledges the child, then the child is legitimate.
QUESTION:

Well, what if they don't marry, and he

acknowledges ?
MR. WEILL:

If he acknowledges the child, or if

the child's paternity is adjudicated, the child remains
illegitimate and is not eligible to inherit under the Illinois
intestacy law.
QUESTION:
whatever for this.

Now, you said there's no rational basis
What was the historical basis long thought

to be the justification?

0
MR. WEILL:

Me 11, these intestacy statutes and

the exclusion of illegitimate children cone out of medieval
England.

And at that time —

Well, they’ve been regarded as valid

somewhat later than medieval England, have they not?

But the state here has

Supreme Court, while it talks about the proof problem, is

it’s not dealing

with the reality of this situation, or analogous situations,
where paternity has been adjudicated by its own court system.
In that case, there is no more doubt about paternity
than there is for any other child.

They’re not — the Illinois

Supreme Court also ignored situations where the child's
paternity has been acknowledge.
There is no proof problem in this case.
no question as to the paternity.

There is

It's our contention that

this is supported by all of this Court's decisions in the
illegitimacy area, including the Lucas decision, thatthe
state cannot exclude all illegitimate children based upon
proof problems, that the state has to create some form of
nexus between what it considers to be the

proof problem,

and the scope and the quality of the exclusion.

And this

blanket exclusion doesn't do that.
QUESTION:

I understood your response to Mr. Justice

Blackrnun's question to at least intimate that this was not an
unfriendly adversary paternity suit.
MR. WEILL:
doesn't show that.

Did I get that correctly?

Well, I don't really know.

The record

It was, I believe, brought by the

public aid department,

He — the father, Pherman Gordon,

did admit during the course of that trial, did admit his
paternity.
QUESTION:

And that was, you said, was to establish

eligibility for a particular welfare ■—
MR. WEILL:

No, that would not establish the

would already have been receiving AFDC.

No, it does not affect —
Well# then I did misunderstand you.

had the impression from your response that it was related
to some degree of eligibility for benefits.

QUESTION:

Well, what you're talking about is that

recent federal statute, as I understand it.
MR. WEILL:

MR. WEILL:

That’s right.
That requires a recipient —
A pre-existing receipient.
That's right.

And this is if a husband

deserts a marriage situation, if the husband deserts, there
is now an obligation to seek support, isn't there?
MR. WEILL:
QUESTION:
MR. WEILL:

That's correct.

But. —

And that's what this is?
Well, no, because they weren't married.

There is some additional obligations —
QUESTION:

Oh,, they weren't married —• and that's

the same statute, isn’t it?
MR. WEILL:

That's right.

The statute in addition,

to seeking to require support from father, whether or not
there had been a marriage, also seeks to establish the patemiry
of illegitimate children under this federal mechanism.
QUESTION:

And those are federal court suits,

11
too, aren’t they?
MR. WEILL:
the support.

No, only in the last resort to collect

But they're essentially a state court proceeding.

It uses the normal state paternity proceeding, but now that
portion of the state cotirt is 75% federally funded.
QUESTION:

These parents were living together,

weren't they?
MR. WEILL:

Yes, they were.

Second rationale offered by the Illinois Supreme
Court is the so-called presumed intent argument.

To claim

that the statutory disposition is in accord with the presumed
intent of most decedents.
This arguments fails in the first instance because
the intestacy statute is state action, and a state cannot
base its statutory scheme on a presumption of invidious
private intent, nor can the state itself invidiously
discriminate.
QUESTION:

What do you mean, invidious private

intent?
MR. WEILL:

Well, the state is assuming here that

fathers of illegitimate children want to exclude their
illegitimate children.

They have no intent to grant inheritance

rights or otherwise have any dealings with their illegitimate
children, whereas they do — the state makes the exact opposite
assumption for legitimate children.

Mow in cases like

12
Stanley this Court has found that that assumption is
inaccurate, that the state is buildincf its view of childfather relationships on totally outdated stereotypes.
QUESTION:

Well, it may be inaccurate, but I

think you used the word invidious.

Is there anything wrong

if a father in fact decides to make that choice as between
illegitimate and legitimate offspring?
HR. WEILL:

If the father -— if the statute

included illegitimate children, and the father wanted to,
by will, disinherit his legitimate children or his illegitimate
children, he can do that by will.

The state cannot do that

for him, and the state cannot itself assume across the board
of its population an intent to discriminate against illegitimate
children which this Court has said in eight cases is invidious,
that it is basically invidious and irrational in the first
instance to discriminate against illegitimate children.
QUESTION:
MR. WEILL:

What cases did we use the word invidious?
I believe -- X?m not sure, but the line

of eight cases striking down such discrimination certainly
establishes that the illegitimacy discrimination will be
closely looked at, and that it is to a degree suspicious to
exclude all illegitimate children from any statutory scheme.
/

QUESTION:

It is, though, in the power of the father

to remedy that, isn't it?
MR. WEILL:

That's correct.

The father could --

13
QUESTION:
MR. WEILL:

By marriage or by will or by gift.
That's right — it's not always

within the power of the father to marry.

He may be already

married,, or the mother may be already married.
conceivably write a will.

He could

But as we point out in the

brief, very, very few Americans write wills, and particularly
those of the class not only of the decedent father here, but
of, to a large degree, the fathers of illegitimate children.
Their illegitimacy tends to occur in low and moderate income
units where there isn't a lot of property, there is not a
great incentive to write a will,

riot writing a will may be

because there's no access to lawyers, or whatever.

Bo the

argument that he could have written a will, in this case,
a 28 year old man who died from a homicide, does not in the
end justify the state’s own invidious actions.
The state cannot discriminate just because it allows
some people to opt out of that discrimination.
In addition —* we're turning to the presumed intent
for a second. There is a poll in Illinois that is reported in
Mr. Kraus* book, which shows that, this just is not — does not
reflect -- the statute does not reflect the desire's of
Illinois people, including any particular subgroups, sects,
races the poll is broken down —•
QUESTION:

Well, is that a separate basis for

attack on the statute, that you take a poll and it doesn’t *—

14
what the legislature has enacted doesn't reflect the will of
the people?
HR. WEILL:

?Io, but in this case it helps to explain

why the Illinois Supreme Court did not rely on the presumed
intent argument itself.

The XLlinois Supreme Court never

mentioned that it thought the statute was in accord with the
desires of these fathers.

All the Illinois Supreme Court

mentioned,, essentially, was the proof problem, and the last
point, which is the Illinois said that it had an interest
in promoting legitimate family relationships.

So to that

degree, the poll explains why that wasn’t reached.
On the legitimate family relationship paint, this
Court has said in several cases that penalizing illegitimate
children for the sins of their parents is neither a just nor
an effectual way to accomplish the state’s goal of encouraging
legitimacy and encouraging marriage.

QUESTION:

Does this Court have to presume that legis­

lation on a state legislature represents public policy in that
state?

I'm not sure how important it is, but -MR. WEILL:

I’m not sure I understand the question,

that it reflects the policy here of protecting and strengthening
family —
QUESTION:

You say that the law of Illinois is

contrary to the wishes of the people of Illinois.
MR. WEILL:

Cell

15
QUESTION:

And does not reflect the public policy

espoused by a majority of the people of Illinois.

As I say,

I don't really know what materiality or relevance that has,
but it seems to me that if, as, or when it ever became
material, that a court would have to presume that a law enacted
by a state legislature does, in fact, represent the policy
views of the people of that state, until the law is amended.
MR. WEILL:

That’s generally correct.

I was only

making the point here, because the Illinois Supreme Court
has not, in this instance, said that this law reflects the
general intent of the people of Illinois, that that was not
a basis.
Now, that presumption certainly can be made, even
if the Illiniois Supreme Court didn't make it.

But again,

that, doe1? not — f go back — that does not justify the
state's oP) invidiously discriminatory action.
QUEL*

Well, does that concept

need the blessing

of the highest court of the state, or does it flow from the
action of the legislature, as Justice Stewart has suggested?
MR. WEILL:

It does flow from — there is a presumption

that the legislation represents what the people want.

But I

suggest to —
QUESTION:

Well, this does.

I mean, that's the

best evidence of what people want is what their legislature's
enact, isn't it?

16
MR. WEILL:

That's correct.

But v/e're talking

about it in a different context here, in an abnormal context
where the presumed intent argument does not relate to what
the people as a whole want.

It's an argument, about what

decedents in particular want, decedents in a particular
group.

The Illinois court refused to find, or did not find,

that that was happenina here.

It's not a presumption as to

the general population.
I'd like to turn very briefly to the Labine case,
which this Court decided a few years ago.

It's our position

that Labine is substantially distinguishable on several
grounds.

The first case, Labine is significantly inclusive

of illegitimate children in a way that the Illinois statute
is not.

Labine had a mechanism of support for minor,

illegitimate children.

Labine let illegitimate children

inherit before the state escheated to the state.

Labine

also involved a right tc inherit where there was the unilateral
acknowledgement by the father, and an expression — unilateral
expression of an attempt to legitimate.
In addition, Labine involved an —

It’s a little too fast for me, Nr.

The third was that in Labine they allowed inheritance

NR. WEILL:

No, the —

QUES'T’IOTT:
MR. WEILL:

The intestacy succession.
Yes.

The second to last paragraph of

the majority opinion in Labine discusses the Louisiana
Supreme Court decision, the Miller case f in which the
unilateral acknowledgement and statement of intent to
legitimate in that acknowledgement by the father entitled
the child to intestate succession rights.
QUESTION:

And statement of intent to legitimate,

which we don * t have here.
MR. WEILL:
mechanism for that.

That’s right.

Rut Louisiana had a

Illinois has created no mechanism.

Illinois' mechanism is the paternity adjudication, but then
Illinois turned around and ignored that in its intestacy
scheme.

'■
QUESTION:

I see.

And the first distinction you

gave was, that there they provided for support, but here
the support ■— I don't get that distinction.
MR. WEILL:

They provided for support for the minor

child from the intestate estate of the father, from the
heirs of the father.

The child had a right to so-called

alimony support from the estate, not support while the father
was alive.

Since the Gomez decision, that's been true in all

states.

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal=
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Beerman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILES TT„ BEERMAT]??, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BEERMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is no decision of this Court that has held
that illegitimates are a suspect class.

Therefore, we submit

that the proper test to determine whether or not this
particular statute violates the equal protection clause is
not the strict scrutiny test that counsel would ask us to
adhere to, or even a higher scrutiny, but the reasonable
basis test in whether or not this statute bears some rational
relationship to a legitimate state purpose.
I think in one of the questions counsel was asked
about that, and if I may, I think that the state purposes
that this statute served are, one, to encourage family

19
relationships; two, to regulate property of decedents

who

die intestate, property that's located within the borders
of the states; three, the stability of land titles; and
four, the prompt and definitive determination of the valid
ownership of property left by decedent.
Also, I would say that along with that is the prompt
adjudication of probated estate.
Another one of the purposes would be to deter
spurious claims, which I'll get into,
QUESTIONS

Hr. Beerraan, we’re not really talking

about very much in this estate, are we?
HR, BEER’iAN:

No, your honor, as a matter of fact

we’re talking about $1500,
QUESTION:

And your clients concede — maybe it

doesn’t make any difference anyway — do they have a blood
relationship to this little girl?
HR. BEERHAN:

Well, my client —- I have only one

client, your honor, and that's the mother of the decedent.
So that she's a blood paternal grandmother of the little
girl,
QUESTION:

I suppose you’re not defending the

Illinois statute as a matter of policy, if you were a
legislator, and it says that a paternity suit or an
acknowledgement isn’t enough; there has to be marriage in
addition?
HR. BEERMAN:

Well, it still sets up a mechanism

20
whereby the child car. be recognized.

Insofar as Labine,

which counsel alluded to, when the father of Labine
acknowledgedthe child , he could have also made another
statement

along with that acknowledgement, allowing the

child to inherit, bid- he didn't do that.
In this case, the decedent didn't marry the mother
of the child, and didn't acknowledge the child.

"Tow,

technically, the child was acknowledge!for him in the
paternity proceedings.

There was an order that issued from

the circuit court of Cook County deciding that he was the
father, and ordering him to pay support for the child.
But getting bcick to these state purposes, they
were recognised as being valid, not only in Labine, but in
this Court’s opinion in Weber versus Aetna, even though the
Weber decision went the other way because it was discrimination,
as I recall it, among illegitimates.

It is clear that the

power to make such rules, to bear that relationship to the
stata purposes, should be left to the states.
Getting to the statutory will theory, I believe
that the statutory will theory is a viable and valid theory.
I think that the laws of intestacy are an attempt by the
state to determine

to whom the decedent would want his

property distributed if he was to die unexpectedly or without
making a will.
Now, the fact, as counsel alludes to, that most

21
people don't make wills, I think proves that people are
satisfied with the legislative action in this area, that, for
example, in Illinois if there’s no will, and there’s a
surviving spouse and no children, the surviving spouse, I
believe, receives everything.

If there are children, the

surviving spouse receives one third and

the children receive

two thirds.
In this particular case, the decedent, by malting
a will, could have left everything to his child.

Now, in

Illinois, a surviving spouse, if she’s left out of the will,
can renounce the will.
the will.

The children have no right to renounce

And there is no right in a child in Illinois to

inherit from its father.

So that -- and that doesn't make

any difference whether you're legitimate or illegitimate,
you give away to your mother, so to speak — she has a right
to renounce the will, and children have no right to renounce
the will.
QUESTION:

How about — maybe an afterborn child

has some rights?
MR. BEERMAN:

v
An afterborn child --- if I recall

the statute correctly — is an automatic renunciation — is
an automatic revocation of the will, your honor.

And the

afterborn child takes as if the decedent dies intestate.
So that if the decedent had cut out all his children that
were born before the afterborn child, the afterborn child

22
could take as if there was no will, even though the other
children were cut out.
QUESTION:

It isn’t quite right to say the

children have no rights, because if there is no will at

all

and the parent dies intestate, there are rights.
MR. BEERMAN:
Stevens.

I didn’t mean to imply that. Justice

You're 100% correct.

What I9m stating is that the

children in Illinois have no inherent rights to inherit from
their father.

And yes, if the

father dies intestate, legiti­

mate children would inherit two thirds or all of his estate as
the case may be.
QUESTION:

With respect to your argument about the

problem of probate, certainty c£ title , and prompt ownership
and all the rest, how* does that apply when you've got an
adjudication,1 as you do in this case, of paternity?

Why is

that any harder to establish than the normal legitimate
fatherhood?
1

MR. BEERMAN:

I don't know that it isn't, except

that you may, I suppose -- what, the legislature had" in mind
when they added the added criteria or the added condition
of having the parents intermarry, would be so that the
illegitimate children would not take the exclusion of
legitimate children.
The — I think on e of the main problems here is,
you know, the philosophical problem of whether- or not the

23
fact: that, a child has been decreed to be the child of the
decedent, if you will, means that that child is the natural
object of the decedent's bounty»
of an illicit relationship»

The child is the victim

And I think that overriding all

of these concerns is the family relationship.
QUESTION s

Well, that family argument has always

puzzled me somewhat, because it would seem to me that by
saying to the father, if you have illegitimate children,
they cannot share in your estate, that is less of a deterrent
than if you said to the father, if you have an illegitimate
child, that child will share with your children.

Why does

one deter the misconduct, more than the other?
HR. BEERMAN:
from-the opposite,.

I don't think it's —• I look at it

I think that by stating that -— what the

legislature was trying to do, I think, and what the public
policy of the state is, is to foster legitimate family
relationships, and not to foster illicit relationships by
stating that if you die intestate, your illegitimate children
will share in your estate.

I'm not sure if IBm answering your

question, but the — I don't know if there is an answer.

The

point is that the father, if he wanted to, could make a will
and leave all of his- estate to any of his children, or to
none of his children, as the case may be.
QUESTION:

Well, if you rely on the ability to

make the will, of course that answers everything.

MR. REERMAN:

Well, I really think it does.

I don't

think that there’s anything mysterious about making a will.
QUESTION:

Well, then, I suppose you could have a

statute that said, blacks cannot inherit from, whites, because
you presume whites wouldn't want blacks to inherit their
property, and they could always raaks a will to leave their
property to whomever they wanted to.

What would be wrong

with such a statute?
MR. BEERMAN:

I don't think that bears any

relationship to a legitimate state purpose.

I can't conceive

of one.
QUESTION:

Well, the legitimate state purpose would

be that, presumably, if people had to take a poll, most
people would assume that more whites would want their property

race.

Isn't that a realistic assumption, even if it may

not be a very attractive one?
MR. BEERJIAN:

I can imagine under circumstances it

could be realistic.
QUESTION:
wrong with that?

Well, wouldn't it be — what would be

Why couldn’t you have this same kind of statute on racial
grounds, in other words?

MR, BEERMAN:

Well, because I don't think that

this kind of statute is something that the legislature —*
I don’t think they have the right to put up the statuta.
I think that statute would be clearly unconstitutional, a
denial of equal protection.
Let’s take — we can carry the hypothesis a little
\

further.

If you have a white man married to a black woman,

then if he wanted to die-- he couldn’t die intestate then,
because under your hypothetical situation, his money wouldn't
go to his children, assuming that they would be deemed black.
So that he would have to make a will in order to leave his
money to his children.

illegitimate children were not a suspect class.
MR. BEERMAN:

Well, another element was introduced

in the hypothetical question, as I understood it.

macy is not suspect, but a racial discriminatory statute
would be quite suspect.
MR. BEERMAN:

That's

correct.

And that's what would

make the

statute in Justice Stevens' hypothetical clearly

unconstitutional„
QUESTION:

Well, clearly suspect as the threshold,

MR, BEERMAN:

At the least.

At the least.

then I don't think there could be any rational or reasonable
purpose to the state in passing such a statute.
The other things that I wanted to point out ■— and
I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

you've alluded to some

of them ~ is that the decedent could change this so-called
statutory will by a number of methods.

He could execute a

written will, he could create a joint tenacy, he could desig­
nate a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, he could
create a trust, he could, make a gift, there's a number of
things he could do either under Illinois statute or by law,
by federal law.
He could have —- and as I've already stated — he
could have left the entire estate to this child to the
exclusion of everyone.

QUESTION:

Of course this was — it should be

resolved whether it was $1,500, $15,000 or a million and a
half.

The principles are the same, are they not?
MR. BEERMAN;

I'm in perfect agreement with that,

That's the whole point.

I’m sure that if the Court was

convinced that we ware just talking about this one case,
and there was only $1,500 involved, and that whatever the
Court did in this case didn't transcend these particular
facts, that we wouldn't be here arguing the case.
Another recognized purpose of the statute is the
prevention of spurious claims.

The Court has recognized that

purpose in many of its decisions, most notably in the
Jiminez case decided in 1974.

The Illinois Supreme Court

in the Karas case alluded to the grandfather type example
where a grandfather died, and he had one child, a son, who
pre-deceased him, by let's say, 15 or 20 years.

And the

grandmother, the wife of the present decedent, is left
surviving.

And she would be entitled to his entire estate

by the laws of intestacy.

And now some person comes along

claiming to be the illegitimate child of the son who had

30
been dead for 20 years.

And there’s really no way to

disprove the paternity.

On the other hand the child, of

course, has a tough time

proving it.

But it puts this

widow of the grandfather irt an awfully tough position.
QUESTION:

I suppose you don’t know why the Karas

case didn’t come here?
MR. BEERMAN:

That was a much larger estate?
Well, not only that, there were

two cases there, your honor.

And they both stopped there,

at the Illinois Supreme Court.

I’m sorry, but I don't

know why they didn’t come here.
It's out --QUESTION:

Mr. Beerman, you’re talking about the in­

testate law of Illinois?
MR. BEERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your honor.

And the purpose, as I understand it, is

to take care of estates where there is no will.
MR. BEERMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your honor.

While how is

it a defense to it that

he could make a will to get around it?
MR. BEERMAN:

Well, because we're talking about the

narrow issue, your honor.

The laws of intestacy take up

two or three pages in the Illinois statutes.

The thing that

we're talking about takes up about two sentences.

And the

theory being that if you accept the theory of the statutory
will, that the man who dies intestate is presumed to know the

31
lav/, and is presumed to adopt the laws of intestacy as his
so-called statutory will, then he knows that if ha's got an
illegitimate child, that illegitimate child cannot recover.
He knows, for example, as Sherman Gordon can be presumed to
know in this case, that if he had a mother and some brothers,
he had a mother, father, some brothers and sisters, as I
recall — the mother, and father, and the brothers and sisters
would share equally.

Mow, he further knows that by writing

a will he could have disinherited all of those people and
left his entire

estate to the little girl.

any constitutionality of the state law, the fact that a will

QUESTIONS

I don’t accept the fact that there's
that’s ray point.

Mr. Bee naan, the claim as I understand

it, is that you have thousands and thousands and thousands
of people who die intestate, all of whom who could have made
a will.

But you have a large portion of the population who

die intestate.

And that the children of those intestate

decedents are of two kinds, some are legitimate and some are
illegitimate.

2\nd of course you could have — all of them

could have made a will and left his property as he wanted to.
But looking at it solely from the point of view of
the surviving child, what is the justification in terms of
the child for treating the illegitimate differently from
the legitimate?

MR. BEERMAN:

I think that from

the child's standpoint, it probably doesn't help him.

that it doesn't legitimate him by becoming an heir of his

MR. BEERMAJ!:

QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And so to the extent that Illinois does

allow intestate inheritance for the mother, it has ameliorated
the harshness of the common law rule.
MR. BEERMAN:

It has been on the books for many

years in Illinois, this particular rule.

That’s correct,

your honor.
The other point we want to make on this issue is,
that it’s our contention that this Court’s decision in Labine
versus Vincent cbntro3° — and it especially controls —
>

because in this case and under the facts of this situation,
the father here

could have done more for his child than

could the father in

Labine.

For example, in Labine, the child must be acknowledged
in order to take under the father’s will.
thing that we haven’t heard yet.

See, that’s one

You just couldn't make a

will in Labine and leave your estate to the child, under
Louisiana law, which as Justice Marshall points out, is
entirely different than the otKer 49 states.
Then even if the■child is acknowledged, and you
make a will leaving him part of your estate, you

can only

leave him one fourth or one third of the estate, and that’s

36
if there are no surviving legitimate children or their heirs.
While in Illinois,, Illinois has ameliorated the rule, as you
point out, Justice Stewart, of filius nullius, because if
he

mad^ the will he could leave the child everything.
Also, there’s apparently in Louisiana acknowledgement

is a condition precedent to the child’s right to claim support
from the father.

That8s not true in Illinois, as is evident

in this case, because when a paternity suit is brought, the
defendant doesn’t have to plead guilty.

He can put. up a
\

defense, and if the court finds that he’s guilty5, then

he

doesn’t — he never has to acknowledge the fact that he’s
the father, he’s adjudicated the father, and he's made to
support the child.
Also, in Louisiana an acknowledged child can inherit
from a father intestate if the father has no heirs, collateral
or lineal, to the exclusion only of the state.

And of course

in Illinois, an illegitimate can never inherit intestate from
the father.

That’s the main difference.

The other striking point is that in Louisiana
legitimate children have a right of forced heirship in
their father’s estate, whereas in Illinois, as I pointed out,
legitimate children don't have that right.
So it's

our contention that Labine would control

even more, in this case, than it did on the facts of its own
case.

37

I'd like to allude to the sex discrimination issue,
although counsellor hasn't talked about.

We have serious

doubts that it's; even properly before the Court.
we've briefed all that.

I think

I just would like to point out one

other thing, that when the notice of appeal was originally
filed in this case — and I'm sorry that this is not in my
brief, but I hope that your honors will indulge me — when the
*

notice of appeal was originally filed in this case, from the
order of the probate court of Cook County declaring the
heirship, only the mother was named as an appellant in only
a representative capacity.

She was named as Jessie Trimble,

as the mother and next friend of the child, Data Mona Trimble.
So that we don't believe she's a proper appellant.
Now, the record got pretty muddied up, because
what happened after that, was, when they made their motion
under Illinois Supreme Court rule 302 (b) for direct appeal
to the Illinois Supreme Court, thus bypassing the appellate
court — and v/e dp that in matters of importance that require
prompt determination — all of a sudden she became an appellant.
And there's no •— nothing in the record, nobody objected to
it.

I have to admit that.

appellant.

But she suddenly became an

Then, she also became an appellant in the notice

of appeal to this Court, and in her brief amicus curiae in
the Karas case, she was named as a party.
But the fact is that under Illinois Supreme Court

38
rule 301 the notice of appeal is a jurisdictional step, and
I don't think that anyone can waive it by not arguing it, and
I don’t think anybody can cure it.

So X don't really believe

that she’s a proper party in this Court.

person, is being discriminated against on the basis of her
sex and treated differently than a male person, because the

anything further, Mr. Weill?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. WEILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MR. WEILL:

Just one point, your honor.

I believe

the standing issues are fully treated in the briefs.
I’d just like to point out that most of the
arguments that opposing counsel has made have been implicitly
or explicitly rejected by this Court's unanimous opinion in
Reed versus Reed.

In Read, a case involving an estate of

less than a thousand dollars, by the way, this Court, where
there was sex discrimination in the appointment of admini­
strators in intestate estates, this Court rejected the
constitutionality of that statute, even though it recognized
that it eased the probate court5s administrative burden, or
judicial burden, and even though most of those sexually
discriminatory appointments could have been altered by a will
of the decedent.
The Reed case is structured very much the way this
case is.

And this Court unanimously rejected the same

structure in a similar context.

Bex, like illegitimecy,

has not been treated as a suspect class by a majority of the
Court, but also bears many of the same traditional .indicia.
And we'd just call that to the Court's attention.

respond to that at all?
MR. WEILL:

Do you want to

Because I think it’s critical.

Well, I believe that this case is

44
clearly stronger than Lab in e on the facts.

Firsts, there

was an adjudication here of the father's paternity.

For

all purposes,, in Illinois, Illinois has said that this is
the father’s child, or was the father's child.
Now, the Illinois Supreme Court turns around and
says that there are proof problems.

Okay, there are just

no proof problems in this case at all.

It’s stronger than

Labine in that sense.
Secondly, the Labine scheme, as I mentioned, was
inclusive of illegitimate children.

This Court has consistently

struck down total exclusions of illegitimate children from any
statutory scheme in the last eight years.
exceptions have been Labine and Lucas.

The two partial

In both of those

cases, there were substantial benefits to the class of
illegitimate children.

Labine may not have been as carefully

tuned as Lucas was, but it was significantly inclusive.
Those are the two major points that I’d make.
QUESTION i

I believe the point that your brother

made was that in Louisiana the father was not free to make
a will to designate the illegitimate as a beneficiary without
doing something further.

the will, to make him one.
