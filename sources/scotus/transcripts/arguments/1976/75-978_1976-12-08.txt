ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BARNARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BARNARDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These three consolidated cases present basic
statutory issues as to the form and content of regulations
under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 for
existing sources — that is, existing plants — and for
new sources — that is, new plants.
The

regulations under which these issues arise

concern the inorganic chemical manufacturing industry.
Petitioners in 978 and 1433 present the issue
whether the regulations by EPA for existing plants shall be
guidelines for effluent limitations as Section 304 (b)
expressly commands, or whether EPA relying on an authority
said to be derive by implication from Section 301 can override
the provisions of Section 304 and issue effluent limitations
which shall be mechanically cranked into every permit
regardless of the circumstances or the conditions of the
plant in the category.
The resolution of these statutory issues provides

the basis for the determination of the jurisdictional issue
which is also present in these cases.
The question presented on the cross petition in
No. 1705 relates to the issue of whether EPA's regulations
should, as the court below held, provide a safety valve
procedure, in the Court's words, enabling an individual plant
to show that it's entitled to a variance from a single
number standard because of the special circumstances of that
particular plant.
There's no jurisdictional issue in 1705.

The

statute expressly provides for review in the Court of Appeals
of new source standards.
The Federal Nater Pollxifcion Control Act of 1072
made radical changes in the manner in which both municipal
and private plant effluents are controlled.

The Court in

the last term in the California case had occasion to consider
this ACt in detail.

I shall therefore merely thumbnail

sketch the statutory plan.
Section 301 of the Act prohibits all discharges
by plants except as the discharge is authorized and covered
by a permit.

Section 301 states, quote, "...to carry out

the objectives of the Act there shall be achieved, by 1977,
effluent limitations for point sources requiring installation
of best practicable control technology currently available.
For 1983 effluent limitations requiring application of best

5
available technology

economically achievable."

Section 301 expressly provides that these require­
ments are to be defined and determined pursuant to regulations
under section 304 (b) of the Act.
The primary means of achieving and enforcing
effluent limitations is a permit procedure

under Section

402 where the regulations are applied to individual plants.
The regulatory shceme for new
but has important differences.

sources is similar

Section 300 of the Act

directs EPA to establish standards of performance — not
guidelines —* for new sources which meet the statutory
technological requirement of best available demonstrated
control technology.
These standards are also applied to individual
plants in the course of a permit process.
I will address first the issues that concern
regulations for existing plants , and the jiirisdictional
issue which is related.

I will then turn to the issues as

they relate to the new sources on the cross petition.
Before discussing these matters, perhaps I should
explain what appears to be the procedural complexity apparent
in these cases.
The complexity arises because in February, 1974,
about a year and a half after the statute was passed, EPA
first announced its position that it had implied authority

6
to Issue regulations under Section 301 establishing limitation!
The regulations in the form of single number limitations
would be issued, EPA said, under both Section 301 and 304

(fc>) .

At the same time, EPA announced that since these
regulations were to be issued under 301, the exclusive
review provisions of Section

509

(b) would be applicable,

and the 90 day period within which petitions must be filed
would be equally applicable.
Petitioners disagree with EPA's view that it has
implied authority to issue limitations which override or
disregard the expressed commands in Section 304

(b) of the

Act.
We likewise disagree with EPA on exclusive juris­
diction to reviextf under Section 509.
However, because of EPA's announced position,
petitioners,

filed the protective petitions for review in

the Court of Appeals at the same time as the petitions
for review of the new source standard^ were filed.
Petitioners also filed a complaint, in the Western
District of Virginia, challenging certain of the inorganic
regulations that are here before the Court.

•

The appeal from the District Court was consolidated
with the petitions for review in the Court below.

The two

proceedings on alternate jurisdictional bases -- the complaint
in the District Court, and the petitions for review in the

7
Court of Appeals — are both h efore this Court»

Consequently

there is no jurisdictional or procedural issue which stands
in the way of this Court resolving the statutory question
and the related jurisdiction problem.
With the procedural complexity out of the way, I'd
like now to turn to the statutory issue.
In DuPont 2, the Court below characterised the
statute as quote vague, uncertain and inconsistent, and
described the Court's objective as somehow making EPA's
position workable with the statute -- the Court's word was
workable.
We suggest that if the Court had focussed more on
the words of the statute and less on the quasi-legislative
function of trying to make EPA's position somehox? workable
to the statute, it would have found the statutory plar
relatively straightforward and non-complex.
QUESTION:

Well, do you suggest that the workability

is not a factor that a court takes into account when it examines
\

\

a statute?

V

HR. BERNARD:
workability obviously.

I believe a court should consider
But the court should look to the words

of the statute, not to see whether it can accomodate something
and make it workable in my suggestion.

And the words of the

statute are not designed to make something workable.

The

words of the , statute are the command which the court and EPA

f?

should follow».
And I would turn to the words of the statute, which
1 believe dmonstrates that the Court's practical consideration
disregards the words of the statute.
QUESTION:

Would you carry that to the point "where

if, pursuing that course would determine the statute was
unworkable?
MR. BARNARD:

I suppose it could happen thatthe

statute could be determined to be unworkable.

I don’t think

that’s the situation here at all.
Section 301, as I've said earlier, subsection

(a),

forbids all other charges, unlessthey are permitted under
the law.
Subsection (b) lays the foundations for the regulations
'“tor all existing sources.

To carry out the objectives of the

Act, the subsection says, there shall be achieved, by 1977,
effluent limitations requiring 1977-level technology; and
by 1933, effluent limitations requiring 1983-level technology.
•/

It is significant that Section .301 is written in the
passive voice — objectives to be achieved.

Its only

9

•

\

reference to regulation is the specific reference to regulations
under Section 304

<b).

The technological requirements are to
I

j;

be defined and determined quote in accordance with regulations
issued by the administrator under Section 304
304

(b).

(b) , to which 301 refers., contains the direct

9
statutory command that within one year

,

the administrator

shall publish regulations: providing guidelines for effluent,
limitations.

And Section 304 (b) contains detailed

instructions as to what is to go into these regulations.
It provides that the regulations shall do two things; first,
subsection (1)

(a) and (2)

(a) provide that the administrator

shall identify in specific terms the degree of reduction
in pollution that can be achieved or is attainable by the
application of 1977-level technology in one case and 1983
technology in the other.

^

This is to be accomplished for classe s and
categories of point sources.
Second, subsections (1)
the regulations are to be applied
classes or categories.

(b) and (2)

(b) direct how

to plants within the

Regulations shall specify

the

factors to be taken into account in determining control
measures applicable to point sources within the classes or
categories.
The statutory command is even more concrete, because
it lists the factors which are to be specified in the
regulations, and to be taken into account in framing
permits under Section 402.
EPA asserts that its permit officers are to apply
the factor —QUESTION:

Hr. Barnard, the statute doesn’t specifically

10
refer to Section 402 which yon just quoted, doss it?
MR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

Mo, it does not.

It just talks about effluent limitations.

MR. BARNARD:

Yes, sir*

Section 402 (d) refers

to guidelines, but it does not —- there is not a specific
cross-reference, yes, your honor.
EPA says that if the permit officers are to apply
the f?ctors, this will lead to wholesale reconsideration of
the factors in the perra.it process.
We believe EPA's assertion confuses the role as
to the ’factors and EPA's role and the permit officer’s role.
Obviously, EPA must consider’ the factors in
specifying them in the regulations.

The permit officer uses

EPA's explication of the factors as the basis for applying,
not reconsidering, the factors.
The Congressional intent that these factors, to be
specified by EPA, would be used by permit officers in the permit
process, is indicated by the fact which the court below noted
that a number of the factors are — such as age of the plant -—
are really relevant or applicable only to a particular plant.
One of the clearest confirmation s of the Congressional
intent that this was the pattern to be followed is found in the
conference report, the paragraph quoted in page 55 of our
brief and discussed at length in all of our briefs.
The report referring to Section 304 (fo) which

il
records the Congressional intent that limitations within a
category are to be a s precise as possible* are to be precise
in order that the limitations will be as uniform as possible.
EPA focusses sharply on the word, uniform* and
disregards the explanation in the report that uniformity
does not mean, identity.
To
meant.

the contrary* the report explains what Congress

Similar point sources* Congress said* with similar

characteristics would be subject to similar limitations.
It is precisely this similar treatment, which Section 304 (b)
is designed to accomplish.
And the factors are specified in the regulations.
An officer will be able to select* in tie permit process,
limitations for plants which have similar characteristics,
with the result that they will be treated similarly.

This

is true uniformity.
Section 301 of the Act says the objectives to be
achieved are: effluent limitations requiring 1977 or '83
level technology.
is instructive.

The -definition of effluent limitations
Section 502* 11 says that effluent limitation

means a restriction on discharges from point sources
established by a state or EPA including statutes of
compliance.

A state clearly cannot establish effluent

limitations except in the permit.

And a schedule of

compliance obviously relates to an individual permit.

12

Indeed, it was EPA's effort to change the definition
in the regulations — subsection 11 {i) of the general
provisions -- by deleting the references to the restrictions
established by a state and by deleting a reference to the
schedules

f compliance which led the Court below to set

EPA’s definition aside.
The recrulations before the Court are entitled
quote Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Inorganic
Chemical Manufacturing Industry.

The term "effluent

limitations guidelines" is not a statutory term, but it is
defined in EPA’s general regulations, subsection (j).
Subsection (j) provides

quote, the term effluent limitations

guidelines means any effluent limitations guidelines
issued by the administrator pursuant to section 304 (b)
of the Act.
EPA’s brief does not refer

to this definition,

nor to the fact that the general provisions nowhere speak
of regulations under Section 301 of the Act.
The definition in the general provisions is
in fact a confirmation of the announcement that EPA made
in 1973 in what it called A Motice of Proposed Rule Making.
And it referred there to effluent limitations guidelines
and standards of performance pursuant to 304 (h) of the Act
and 306 of the Act.
7

The announced purpose of the notice was to

13
facilitate comment on rules to be published under Section 304
and Section '306.

Jo reference to regulations under Section 301.

And the proposed inorganic regulations were published in
October, 1973.

The prearnbleexpres s ly stated with respect

to existing plants, quote, the regulations proposed herein
set forth effluent limitations guidelines pxir suant to
Section 304

(b) of the 2\et.

Again, not a word about 301

regulations.
Then the final inorganic regulations were
published, in March, 1974, the preamble referred back to
the proposed regulations for the statement of the legal
bases.

(b)

EPA now asserts that in both the proposed and the

final regulations it gave notice that the regulations
were issued under Section 301.
Section 301 was paraphrased in both the notice
in 1973 and in the preamble to the proposed regulations.
The preamble to the final regulations contains the statement
that the regulations were issued pursuant to Sections
301, 304, 30fi and 307.

But at the

same time it refers

back to the proposed regulations for the statement of
legal bases for the regulations, which was section 304

(b).

The final regulations also incorporate the
general provisions which define effluent limitations
guidelines to be 304

{b}

regulations.

The assertion in EPA."s brief that 301 was cited

14

as the authority, I think, will not withstand the examination
of the record»
At most, it is an acknowledgement by EPA that
301 and 304 are related, because 301 directs that regulations
shall be issued under 304, and 304 directs that effluent
guideline limitations shall be issued„
T-te suggest that the specific words, effluent
limitations guidelines, as they are defined inthe general
provisions, and the words in the preambles to both the
proposed and final inorganic regulations, concern EPA's
contemporaneous interpretation of this ACt, that its job
was to issue regulations in conformity with Section

304 (b)'s

commands,and that that was what it said it intended to issue.
EPA has not virtually abandoned its February, 1974
contention that the regulations are issued under both 301 and
304.

EPA now says that guideline regulations should be —

or regulations should be issued under Section 304 (b).

It

acknowledges that no such regulations have been issued —
and I believe the word it uses is — formally.
It now asserts that it has complied with the
substance of Section 304 (b) by issuing a voluminous
development document and economic report.

I'd like to talk

about that in just a moment.
EPA now argues that it has authority to issue
single number limitations by regulations to he cranked into

3.5
a permit by rote, and that this authority is derived, by
implication, from Section 301.
It asserts an administrative convenience as the
basis for this decision, and a fear of laxity by the state.,
We suggest that EPA is wrong both on policy and
on legal grounds in this position.
On policy grounds, EPA — Congress specifically
decided that the major resoonsibilitv for controlline
pollution within a state shall fall uoon the state.

This

policy is confirmed expressly in section 101 of the Act.
Section 402 which sets up the permit system provides for
transfer from the administration the permits to the ! states
as soon as they satisfy certain conditions in the statute.
And 26 states, I believe, have now satisfied those conditions.
EPA's decision to issue single number limitations
for — because of some fear of state laxity reduces the
:

states to a role of a scrivener.

/

Whatever EPA fears

amount to, and we submit that they are baseless because
of the statutory provisions for review, this reduction of the
role of the state is in contravention of Congress’ intention
that the states shall have a major role in control and
administration of pollution regulations within their states.
To understand how EPA's power by implication position
does violence to the statute, it is necessary to cxo back a
little bit and look at the statutory plan again.

Section 304,

16

as. 1 said, mandates that EPA shall issue regulations for
effluent guidelines which shall identify by category the
degree of reduction attainable by application of 1977 or
'83 technology, and, shall specify the factors applicable in
determining control measures for particular point sources
within the classes and categories.
The statute lists the factors to be specified?
these include: age of facility; process employed; engineering
aspects of the application of the control technology; non­
water quality considerations, specifically, energy
requirements; and cost-benefit for 1977; and process changes
for 1983.
The legislative history of the Act, and particularly
the Senate report, make clear that what Congress was thinking
about was the enormous variety of existing plants.

And

that they wanted guideline regulations that would contain
ranges of numbers for each category, and a specification to
guide the permit authorities in selecting the appropriate
number in the range.
In our brief, we have used the word flexibility
in describincr regulations which comply with the command of
Section 304 (b).

Flexibility in this context means only

that the permits will be tailored to the particular situation
of a particular plant in light of the factors.

It does not

mean that either the regulations or the permit officers can,

17

deviate from the technological requirement in Section 301:
application of best practical control technology for 1977,
and best available for 1983.
Flexibility means that the permit officer will be
guided by the regulation in selecting the control technology
or control measures for a particular plant which meets the
respective 1977 or 1983 requirements, rather than force fit
a single number limitation on a plant regardless of its
special circumstances.

This, we think, is exactly what the

Congress meant when it said in the conference report,
similar plants with similar characteristics shall be subject
to similar limitations.
QUESTION;

Hr. Barnard, could I interrupt with

just one question?
HR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

Sure., sure.

As I understand your basic theory, it

is that 304 authorizes guidelines.

And pursuant to the

guidelines, permits will be issued under Section 402.
HR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.

And that

there's no authority in the

EPA to issue limitations pursuant to 301.
HR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But what do you do with the language

of 509 (e) which specifically says there’s Court of Appeals
review in approving or promulanting agency action, approving

18
or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation
under Section 301?
MR. BARNARD:
clear, your honor.
concerned, that

I think those words are reasonably

Dumber one, so far as approving is

word stems from the fact that the statute that

was originally passed required EPA to approve each state
permit — state-issued permit — before it became-valid.
The approving languaae enabled that, action by the
administrator to be

reviewed in the federal courts.

The limitation language in there clearly refers,
in our view, to Section 301

(c), which authorises the

administrator to deviate from the requirements of 1083 on a
specific finding set forth in Section 301

(c).

In order

to have that reviex-zed, the language had to be in the
statute dealing with limitations under Section 301.
EPA assigns no meaning to the xizord "approving" as
it appears in that section, and, indeed, if EPA's construction
is correct, it refers to limitations under Section 30(5, then
the limitations x»rords in subsection
#2 4 3

duplication under subsection

(f)

are actually a

(a) which deals with new soxirce

standards without purpose or x^ithout affect.
It seems to us clear that that axithori2es — provides
no authority for the kind of general limitations that EPA
has issued which override the commands of Section 304
QUESTION:

(b).

Well, you’ve addressed yourself to the

in
word "approving" but not to the word "promulgating".
HR. BARNARD:

Promulgating the effluent limitatione
v
under Section 301 (c), your honor.
301 (c) provides that the
administrator may vary the requirements of the 1003 level,
and the requirements of the 1903 level are set out in
subsection (b) which directs that it shall be

determined

pursuant to regulations under section 304 (b).
In order to reviex^ those limitations, the statute
had to provide for this kind of review.
QUESTION:

Well, do you read 301 (c) as

providing for general deviations or specific — with regard
to specific permits?
HR. BARNARD:

The statute says — requires a

finding which would make it difficult except to make a
finding in terms of a relatively specific plant.

But it's

conceivable that findings could ha made for more than one.
QUESTION:

But the language is, the administrator

may modify the requirements of subsection (b)(?)(a) of this
section with respect to any point

source for which a

permit application is filed.
I thought it kind of dealt with the specifics
rather than the general.
HR. BARNARD:

Well, it talks about any plant.

And

it requires a specific showing with respect to that plant,
both technological and economic .

QUESTION:

But in any event, it's 301 (c) thatyou

say is all that is really referred to in the words "anproving
or promulgating any effluent limitations or other limitation
under Section 301.
MR. BARNARD:
"promulgating".

Me sav that with respect t<y the word .

TAith respect to the word

approving", I

suggested that it has a broader purpose of providing,for a
review in the federal courts of actions by the administrator
in approving permits that are issued by the states.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. BARNARD:

EPA’s position, in reality, using

its implied authority, is an attempt to amend the statute
and change the statutory plan.

Section 304 (b) says that

the factors to be specified are to be taken into account in
determining the control measures applicable to point sources
within the classes.

ERA now says it has under its applied

authority — it may issue single number limitations to be
mechanically put into the plant — put into the permit for the
plant; and that it can disregard the statutory

command in

Section 304 (b) to specify the factors which will guide
the permit officers.
In effect, this is a repeal pro tanto of section
304 <b) by a power said to be implied in Section 301.

ERA

places great reliance on Section 301 (c), which was just
referred to.

Section 301 (c) authorises the administrator

21

to modify the requirements of subsection 302 (a), which is
the 1933 step, on a factual and economic showing.
section speaks of requirements.

But the

It does not speak of

limitations to be issued under the Section 301.
The requirements specified here are that the
effluent limitations which require the application of the
technology as determined by regulations under Section 304 ,
that’s what the section is speaking of.

The section was

designed to permit the administrator not to provide variances,
but actually to provide a deviation from the 1933 technological
standards.
Without that authority, he could not have provided
a deviation based on the findings which the statute speaks
of.
Section 301 (d), which EPA does not mention in its
brief, like Section 301 (c), also contains a specific
cross-reference to the procedure, the standard to be explicated
by regulations under Section 304 (b)„
Section 301 (d) provides for review every five
years of any limitation required under paragraph (b)

(2),

(that's the 1983 step).
The procedure for the limitations — for the
review of the limitations is carefully identified.

The

revision is to be pursuant tothe procedure- set out in
paragraph (b)

(2).

This cross-reference is to- the procedure

22

set out in paragraph (b)

{2}, which is regulations under

Section 304 (b).
The legislative history confirms that this section
was designed to deal with the period after 1983»
normally last five years,

The permits

They need to be reviewed.

The

statute provides for 1977 or '83 technological requirements.
Beyond that, you're to move toward no discharge.
This section contemplates that as the permits
come up for renewal on a five year term, they will be
renewed subject to the regulations under 304 (b) which are then
in effect; in short, the most up to date regulations will be
applicable to those permits as they are reviewed.
EPA now acknowledges that there should be regulationis
under Section 304 (b).

It asserts that the length development

document and economic report comply in substance with the
mandate of Section 304 (b)„
There are two basic objections to this.

304 (b)

directs that regulations provided in guidelines for effluent
limitations shall be issued — not discursive documents that
have no legal effect.

Secondly, these documents perform

none of the functions of guideline regulations, because
they provide no guidance to permit officers.

EPA says

it has issued limitations which must be cranked into the
permit.

There5 s no guidance to the officer except to crank

them into the permit.

EPA makes four additional and I suggest non-consistent arguments on the matter of the from and contents of the
regulations.
In the preamble,, EPA says that Section 304 (b)
provides for guidelines to implement the standards of
Section 301, all by itself, an interesting term.

Congress

thus recognised, EPA says, that quote some flexibility
quote was necessary to take into account the complexity of
the industrial world.

To achieve that flexibility, EPA
■J

' ‘ V' '

put into the regulations for each subcategory a standard
clause authorizing the administrator to grant a modification
of the single limitation upon a showing thatthe factors
applicable to a particular plant are fundamentali/different
from those considered by the administrator.
i

This provision, EPA
which the statute contemplated.

says, provides the flexibility
Three courts have disagreed:

the court below, the 3rd Circuit and the District Court in
the Grain Processing case. The 2nd Circuit held that
without some variance provision the scheme of limitations
could well founder on the rock of illegality, but it postponed
a decision as to the validity of the particular variance
clause to the facts of a particular case.
We suggest that this narrow variance clause should
not be debated for the reason that it is surplusage.

Moreover

in August, 1974, EPA announced that it was rethinking the

24

variance clause, and asked for public comment on the
variance clause»

EPA has not revealed

results of that re­

examination.
EPA is correct* in our view, that the Congress did
intend some flexibility.

Indeed, it went further.

specifically provided for the flexibility.

It

If EPA had

c omplied with Section 304 (b) by specifying the factors to
be taken into account in determining the limitations in a
i

permit, there would be no need to devise a narroxi? variance
clause.

The statute itself determines, in specific terms,

the flexibility which Congress said was permissible.

And

that's Section 304 (b)»
Second, the EPA said it considered the factors in
setting up the subcategories in these regulations, and
thatthe factors justified no further subcategorization»
The issue is not further subcategorisation, but
whether EPA can ride roughshod over the command in Section
304 (b) that it specify the factors to be taken into account
in determining the control measures for plants within a
category of class.
Third, EPA says that its regulations provided
ranges because limitations — different limitations had
been fixed for different subcategories.

But the fact that

there are different numbers for different categories does
not create a range that Congress contemplated, as the 3rd

25
Circuit correctly pointed out.

A range made up of different

numbers in different subcategories is no guidance to a permit
officer in determining control measures for a plant within a
single category.

A limitation applicable to a plant manu­

facturing sodium silicate in the sodium silicate subcategory
is not relevant in any way to determining the limitations
for a plant manufacturing titanium dioxide in the titanium
dioxide subcategory.
Fourth, EPA also takes the position that there is an
implicit range in each subcategory from the specific limitation
number down to zero.

But this range is, as the 3rd Circuit,

again, we think correctly, held, is an illusion.

No factors

are specified to enable the permit officer to select a
number within this quote range.

Nore basically, the 'record
\

doesn’t provide any support for a number down to zero, when
the number EPA selected, based on the record, is a number
above zero.
Finally, EPA says that there is great administrative
convenience in having single number limitations.
to administer.

It’s easier

And it refers to the use of uniform in the

con ference report.
Whatever the administrative convenience is concerned,
it cannot override the commands of section 304 as explained
inthe conference report, that similar plants with similar
characteristics shall be subject to similar limitations.

26

This emphasis by Congress on the similarity of
treatment is easily understood.

When Congress was developing

the 1972 Act, EPA was well along in developing the so-called
' ^

permit program under the Refuse Act.

-v'

Congress xvas well aware

of the fact that EPA had prepared what are called
guidance documents.

These guidance documents recognized the

range of plants in the industry, and established ranges of
parameters by subcategories.
Some of the guidance documents actually referred
to the factors.

Others, the inorganic guidance documents,

says that EPA will provide a technical b.riefing so that the
permit officers will understand how the factors are to be
applied in the course of issuing permits.
And it's this same regulatory pattern which we
believe the Congress had in its mind when it adopted Section
304 (b) providing for guidelines.

Indeed, the regulatory pattern

continued after the Act was passed to assist the permit offi­
cers

in the interval before new regulations were issued.

EPA

in May, 1973, directed thatthe guidance documents would be
used by the officers in issuing permits quote until effluent
limitations — until effluent guidelines are prcmu!crated under
Section 304.
This reference to effluent guidelines under 304,
and the character of the guidance documents themselves
are further evidence of the contemporanceous construction

27

that EPA gave to this statute»
Now, this pattern was abruptly changed in February,
1974, when Assistant Administrator Kirk's memorandum was
made public, a memorandum that announced the new theory that
the regulations would provide limitations in reliance on
implied authority under Section 301.
This about face by the administration in the midst
of the regulatory process demonstrates that there had been
no consistent administrative
court should defer.

interpretation to

which this

To the contrary, such an about face

means, we suggest, that the current-administrative position
provides very little guidance to what the statute means
and to how it should be interpreted.
There are other provisions in the Act which confirm
that EPA's current position is wrong, and that Congress intended
the regulatory structure to be based on guidelines under
Section 304 (b).
Section 515 of the Act creates a distinguished
scientific review committee.

EPA was directed to send

proposed regulations to this committee for review in advance
of publication.

Section 515 refers specifically to

regulations under Section 304 (b).

It does not refer to

regulations under Section 301»
It’s difficult to believe that if Congress had in­
tended regulations to be issued under Section 301, which

28

override the provisions of Section 304 (b), it would not
have provided for their review by the advisory committee.
All the other major regulations *— pre-treatment standards,
new source standards — are mentioned along with Section
304 (b), but there is no reference to Section 301 regulations
in Section 515.
EPA not only fails to mention 515 in its brief,
but also fails to discuss the advisory committee's review
of the inorganic regulation, characterizing them as
quote unscientific.

The committee said, among other things,

the regulations fail to take into consideration great
differences in the individual facilities.

Also, that

EPA disregarded the instructions in Section 304as to the
cost of application of practicable and available technology,
especially for small plants in the industry.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bernard, on this 515 argument,

as I understand it, you don't challenge the EPA's authorities
to issue general limitations for new sources.
MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

The statute commends it.

Does the advisory committee have

authority to review the regulations relating to new sources?
MR. BERNARD:

The statute says they shall foe

submitted to the committee.
QUESTION:

I see.

The new source ones and the

guidelines, but not the existing source ones?

29
MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION;

That's correct.

I see.

MR. BERNARD:

The Court below came a long way toward

recognizing the statutory plan based on guidelines issued
under Section 304 (b), guidelines to be applied in the
permit process.
However, its concern with what it called practical
considerations, and its desire to find what it thought was a
workable interpretation of the statute, led to a compromise
which we believe does not comport with the words of the
statute.
EPA, the court held, can combine regulations under
Sections 301 and 304 and issue limitations by regulation, the
court said.

But the court was not willing, as EPA would like,

to read Section 304 out of the Act.
The limitations, the court concluded, are
presumptively applicable.

That is, the regulations are to

be applicable unless the presumption is rebutted.
The reference, the court said, to 304 (b) in
Section 301 means thatthe Congress intended that the factors
set out in Section304 (b) were to be applied by the permit
officer in determining whether the presumptively valid
regulations shall be applied to a particular plant.
The Court stopped short of requiring, as the 3rd
Circuit did, that the factors be set out in the regulations.

30
And we believe this is what Section 304 (b) comends.
The compromise by the court below, on what it
called practical grounds, moves a long way from EPA's
rigid interpretation of limitations to be cranked in by
rote to permits»

But it falls short of compliance with

Section 304 (b), and in our view EPA should be directed to
comply with Section 304 (b).
This brings me to the jurisdictional issue which
has already been discussed, at least in response to questions
from Justice Stevens,

EPA places great emphasis on sub­

section (e) which Justice Stevens referred to.

It refers

to review of the administrative action in approving or
promulgating effluent limitation under Section 301, 302
or 306*

I’ve indicated that I think the approving language

was in there to provide for review in federal courts of
action by the administrator in reviewing state-issued^permits,
and the promulgating language was there to deal with the
situation of Section 301 (c), where the administrator is
authorised to grant deviations from the 1983 requirement on a
specific finding.
We believe it’s clear that under the normal course
regulations under Section 304 (b) would be reviewable
in the district court.

Thestatute contemplates that they

be issued at different times than the new source standards.
Thera is no question fchatthe review of new source standards

31

is

in the Court of Appeals, subsection (a) of 509 (to)<1)

specifically so provides.
However, we believe that this is an appropriate case
for this Court of conclude that the Court of Appeals had
p endant jurisdiction to review the guideline regulations
at the same time as it reviewed the new source standards.
it turned

As

out,* they were issued on the same record * at the

same time, and the issues that arise, the technical issues,
are substantially the same.

It is therefore, in our view,

an

appropriate case for this Court to conclude thatthe court
#400

below has

pendant

jurisdiction.

This is different

from exclusive jurisdiction, and would not invoked the 90day Clause as a penalty on those who, in relaince on the
statute, did not file within the 90 days.
I now turn to the cross-petition in 1705 in which
the government seeks review of the holding by the Court
below that EPA should insert in the new source standards what
the court called an escape valve, which would enable permit
officers to make adjustments in the requirements of the
single number standards to take into account the special circum/

stances of a particular new plant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bernard, may I ask you one further

question —
MR. BERNARD:
, QUESTION:

Certainly.

■— on the first part of the argument,

32
just, to be sure I have it in mind.
Your view, you stressed the passive language in
301 <b) that there shall be achieved effluent limitations
by such and such a data.

But your interpretation of the

words "effluent limitations":in 301 (b)

CD

(a) is that

that3s the aggregate of all the individual permits that
\

shall be issued, is that right?
MR. BERNARD:
QUESTION:

Correct.

I just wanted to be sure.

MR. BERNARD:

Yes, sir.

And I think if you look

at the second class — or the second clause, which refers
to effluent limitations from municipal plants, which are
to require — are required to implement new source standards,
you can't very well have regulations for limitations that
▼
implement new source standards.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I didn't follow.

To what

did you just refer?
MR. BERNARD:

The second clause, which deals with

municipal plants, directs that affluent limitations are to
be achieved from municipal plants which require compliance
with applicable pre-treatment requirements.

And since

pre-treatment requirements are to be standard, issued
under another section of the statute, it makes no sense to
speak of effluent limitations by regulation to require
application of pre-treatment sta dards which are also to be

33

set out pursuant to another section of the statute,
QUESTION:

Well, unless it was intended to be a

flexible term, covering both

the general requirement and

an aggregate of specific requiremants

Imean, one could read

it that way*
HR. BARNARD:

Well, since it is in the passive,

you can find, it seems to me,' the Congress using both words
together to refer to the program to be implemented under
Section 304 (b) so far as existing plants are concerned, and
under 306 or 307 as far as new source standards or pre*

treatment standards.
QUESTION:

The heart of your argument, as I

understand it, is that there’s expressed authority in
304, there's an absence of expressed authority in 301, and
we should not imply authority from the somewhat ambiguous
language in 301.
FIR. BARNARD:

And as a policy matter, it hsouldn’t

be implied because the Congress looked at the variety of
existing plants and set up a structure that was designed
to deal with that variety and do X'/'nat I’ve repeated three
times, to see that similar plants with similar characteristics
get similar limitations.
QUESTION:

I think I understand,

MR. BARNARD:

And to have single number limitations

that override that plan, we think, is not in

conformity with

34
what the. Congress had in mind.
Mow, the escape valve which the court had in mind
below is not like Section 301 (c) which authorises a deviation
from the 1983

technological requirement.

The standard for

new sources is best available demonstrated control technology.
The escape valve envisaged by the court below would merely
authorize the permit officer to deviate from the single
number limitations that are in the

standards, so long as he

selects a limitation which requires application of best
available technology for that particular source.
Without

such authority, new sources — many new

plants will not be built.

V!e suggest, as the Court below

is correct, that EPA cannot foresee, in a single number stand­
ard, all of the circumstances in all of the new plants, and
provide for them in a single number.

Theescape valve is

necessary to make new plants built.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnard, let me ask just one more.

I’d rather catch you while you here, before I lose all this.
The review provisions authorize the Court of Appeals
to review the new source standards.
MR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

That’s subsection (a).

Subsection (a) under the —- any action

under 307, in other words.
MR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

306.

306, right.

And also 307.

35
MR, BARNARD:
QUESTION:

And also 307 for pre-treatment.

Those are both general in nature and

there’s review in the Court of Appeals.
You say there's comparable importance to the
general guidelines authorized by 304.

But there’s no

direct review in the Court of Appeals of action taken under
304.

How do you explain the •— and when you

attach the similar importance to 304 as you do to 306, how

elected that the review be in the Court of Appeals.

And it's not suitable that regulations

It's the permit that contains the effluent

what to do -—
MR. BARNARD:

That’s right.

under your theory of the case.
MR. BARNARD:

Oh, there’s no doubt.

And I agree

completely with the 8th Circuit that these regulations
should have clout, and they do have clout.

ERA can review --

it not only controls its own permit officers, but it can
review state-issued permits to ,be sure they are within the
guidelines that the statute contemplates.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. BERNARD:

To return to the escape valve, Section

402 (k) of the Act, we believe, contemplates that such
adjustments will be made, because it says that compliance
with the permit shall be compliance with the requirements
of Section 306.

The logic of that subsection is that

escape valve adjustments were in contemplation by the Congress.
But even if section 402 (k) were not in the law,

37

tlis case establish the principle that an «agency may establish
general pricniples or general standards? but it has an
obligation to look to the facts in a particular case in
light of the statutory standard and objective.
This is really almost an element of due process.
General provisions can be fatally arbitrary, without some
#454

kind of quote escape valve.
this to interpretation.

The Weller Act didn’t leave

It specifically provided in Section

402 (k) for such an escape valve.
These cases present a rather unusual situation for
the Court.

It's unusual that an issue of statutory construction

is being presented to this Court at a time when the EPA has
just launched a major review looking to reissuance of 1933
step regulations and new source standards, pre-treatment
standards, for 21 major industry categories, including
inorganic chemicals.
The 1977 step permit process is virtually finished.
Permits are issued.

The question turns now on the renewal,

onto the 1983 step regulations.
Thus, the Court's decision will come at

a time

when the regulations are in their inception, rather than at
the conclusion of an on-going process, that is now under
way for review and reissuance of all these regulations.
EPA’s review was undertaken pursuant to an agreement
signed in June of this year with Natural Resources Defense

38

Council and others to settle four lawsuits filed in District
Court against EPA.
The Federal Register for Wovember 24, 1976, contains
a reference to this review.

It contains an invitation for

the public to participate in what EPA calls the development
of major EPA environmental regulations, and lists, on several
pages, the regulations under consideration.
On page 51865, it lists the 24 industry categories
468

under the following heading:

proposed

effluent guidelines

are now being revised for review of best available technology —
that8s 1983 — in the following source categories.

Then it

lists the 21.
It is perhaps a little more than interesting that
out of the litigation context they call them guidelines.
This same notice refers to the review that I mentioned
earlier undertaken in August, 1974, of the variance clause.
And it says: proposed variance regulations.

Regulations

establishing procedures for obtaining variances from best
tactical treatment requirements and adopted effluent guidelines.
Again

, it's interesting that they call them guidelines.
We suggest that the Court should reverse the

decision below, and direct EP/v to follow the requirements of
Section 304.

We suggest also that this is an appropriate

case for the Court to conclude that the Court below had
pendant jurisdiction to review the regulations, since they

39

were issued on the same record at the same time as the new
source standards which were before the Court.
We think it's appropriate in this case because of
special circumstances in the case.
In the cross petition dealing with the new source
standards, we urge the Court to affirm the decision, below.
Thank you, your honors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

40
the Court:
As this Court pointed out last tern in the
California case, in the 1071 amendments Congress made a
rather sharp chanae in the methods for dealing with the
serious problems this country faces in connection with
water pollution.
Previously, the method for dealina with this had
been focussed on achieving certain qualities of the water,
that is, loolcing to the end product, the water, and trving
to reduce the level of pollutants in it.
In the 1072 amendments, Congress shifted from that
primary emphasis to an emhasis on achieving strict effluent
limitations, restrictions
charged into the water.

i on the amount of pollution dis­
And it further imposed very strict

time schedules: 1077 for the first level, 1*100 for the
second, level, with the hope, the ultimate ob“jective sot forth
in the declaration of goals that by 1-005 pollution of this
country's water would be terminated.
how, the leaislative history o*£ these amendments
shows a clear congressional intent that this required the
establishment of uniform effluent limitations on a national
basis.
The theory that petitioners urge before this Court,
that all the administrator is to do is to promulgate general
guidelines which will specify ranges of permissible pollution

41
that will detail particular factors that the issuers of
permits are to consider in issuing permits, we think would
seriously jeapordize and thwart the entire congressional
plan.
Instead of there being uniform effluent limitations
on a national basis, what you would have is the establishment
of effluent limitations in each of approximately 40,000 or
50,000 proceedings looking to the issuance of a particular
permit.

As I will explain late?:, we do not suggest that these

effluent limitations of the administrator are to be
mechanically cranked in to the pemits.

’’’he oermit issuers

are not to be mere scriveners, as petitioner described.

As

I'll explain, the states will have a very major role in
issuing permits under the administrator's theory.
But if the petitioners are correct, if that's all
the administrator can do, it seems to us it will thwart the
basic congressional objectives of achieving these pollution
limitations, and hopefully, termination of pollution by the
stated date, which can only be achieved through uniform
national standards.

And it's goino to bevery difficult,

almost impossible, to have uniform nations] standards if
each of the dozens of permit issuers has a wide varietv in
passing on the application of the rather generalized guidelines
to particular permits.
Ue think the administrator's interpretation, that

42

he does have authority under Section 301 to promulgate
binding effluent limitations, an interpretation which, I
point out, has been adopted by six of the seven Courts of
Appeals that have considered the problem, does effectuate
the Congressional purpose to achieve these effluent limitations
speedily.
we think this is precisely what Conoress intended.
r.'le

shall argue that this is confirmed by the lanquage of

the statute, bv the scheme fo the statute, and bv the
legislative history.

And it represents the administrative

interpretation of the statute by — in the language in

mo

Udall v. Taliman —

of the officials charged with setting

’

fv''

the machinery in notion, of making the parts work effectively
and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.
And that kind of an interpretation is one to which
the Court traditionally gives great deference.

And last

term in the California case the Court recognized the appropriate
ness of such deference in interpreting this highly complex
and technical statute.
Wow, I will shortly in my argument come and answer
the contention that the administrative interpretation first
appeared shortly before the rean1ations were issued.

It's

our submission that he has taken this position that he is
go in a to act under both 301 and. 304 from the outset of the
effectiveness of this statute.

Now, we have set out in our brief a number of the
statg&gjgfy provisions which we think show that Congress
intended the Administrator to have this authoritv.

Many of

them are very technical and not particularly suitable tor
oral presentation,
forth.

Thev involve cross-references back and

But there are three or four that I'd like to refer

to which we think clearly recoani^e the authority of the
Administrator to promulgate these binding effluent limitations
And the source for this is the Administrator’s creneral
authority,, under Section 501

(a) , to prescribe such regulation

as are necessary to carrv out the Administrator’s functions
under this Act.
Now, the first provision to which we refer is
Section 101 (e).

And we have filed with the Court the

paper edition of the statute..

It's unfortunately terribv

long and terribly complicated, but I will refer to the
particular pages of this pocket pamehlet in dealing with then.
This is on page 30 of the statute, Section 301

(e).

Now, what it states is, effluent limitations
established pursuant to this section or Section 303, which
deals with'water quality control, shall be applied to all
point sources of discharge of pollutants in accordance with
the provisions of this Act.
‘low, it speaks of effluent limitations established
pursuant to this section,

And it seems to us this recognizes

that something other than an effluent limitations —
QUESTION:

You've lost me»

Page 30, whore on pane

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Page 30 at the bottom of the page,

subsection (e), last paragraph»
QUESTION:

Thank you very much.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

This, it seems to us, indicates

that what is being spoken about here in effluent limitations
established pursuant to this section is something other than
effluent limitations established in permits.
The same thing is true, we think, with respect to
subsection (c), which is two paragraphs above subsection
(e), which authorizes the Administrator to modify the
requirements of subsection .(b), which deals with the effluent
limitations, in case of any application for permits filed after
July 1, 1977.
Hell, if the only wav that the effluent limitations
are to be established is through the permits, there was
obviously no need to give the Administrator the authority
to waive anv limitations,

'’’’his again, it seems to us,

clearly contemplates that there will be established effluent
limitations separate and apart from the permits.
Now, Mr. Barnard has suggested in dealing with the

provision in Section 501 (b)
77 of the statute

,

(1), which is set out at paqe

that when the statute says there may be

review had of the action of the Administrator, in approving
or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation
under Section 301 and. 302, et cetera? all that refers to is
his action in granting an exemption under 301 (c).
Well, first of all, it seems to us the language
is much broader than that, and there's nothing in anything
of history of this suggesting such a limitation.

But that

argument ignores the very next subsection of this paragraph
which also provides for review of the administrative action
in issuing or denying any permit under Section 402.
And it seems to us that if the only way that ef­
fluent limitations were to be established was through permits
there would be no need for these two paragraphs. Because if
they were only to be established through permits, if the
Administrator approves a modification, a variance, from an
effluent limitation on a particular permit, that would be
reviettfable, we think, under Section 402.
Now, there's one other provision which Mr. Barnard
has not referred to which is Section 505 at page 73 of the
statute, it goes over to 74.

That provision permits citizen

suits against any person alleged to be in violation of an
effluent standard of limitation under this Act.

7md under

that provision there's a separate section, subsection (f)

on page 74, which defines, for purposes of citizens’ suits,
what these terms mean.

And it defines effluent limitation to

include, under subparagraph (2), an effluent limitation or
other limitation under Section 301 or 302, and then under
subsection (6), a permit or condition thereof issued under
Section 402.
So once again a clear recognition

that there are

two different animals we're talking about. . One is an
effluent limitation established under 301 or 302.

The other

is a permit which, by definition, also will contain an
effluent limitation, since it specifies the precise limit of
discharge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, wouldn't Mr. Barnard say

that Section 301 — the reference to 301 in subsection (f) —
refers to 301 (c), and a modification which is in a specific
case?

Or would that not fit?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t know.

He tries to — it

seems to me that what he tries to do is to take these very
general phrases and very broad terms in the Act and attempt
to cut them down and try to give them a very limited reading.
But we think fairly read the whole statutory scheme is a
recognition — these various provisions, and there are others
which we have cited in our brief — a recognition that in
fact Congress intended the Administrator to be able to
prescribe effluent limitations that are binding.

47
QUESTION:

But if you look at the statute broadly,

and if you’re riqiit that there can be a general regulation
or general effluent limitation for existing sources,, what is '
there in the statute that requires a permit for existing
sources?

If anything?
HR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, what requires a permit is

Section — we start with 301 (a), which says, except in
compliance with this section and sections 302 and 402 of this
Act, the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be
unlawful.

limitation, and that the discharge is not violating the

does not specify and apply the precise amount of discharge
that a particular plant can make in terms of the general
limitations.
this.

Let me, if I may, give a specific example of

For example, in the chlorine subcategory there are

specific limitations.

You can discharge a certain amount of

a particular pollxitant for each 1000 pounds that you produce.
That’s the way the effluent limitation is formulated.
Sometimes it's in terms of so much a day, so much a month,
and so on.

/'
The job of the permit issuer, and the reason for

the permit, is to specify exactly how much this particular
plant can discharge.
a mechanical job.

And that is something more than just

It's not just cranking them in.

requires a number of calculations.

It

For example, frequently

it's unclear precisely which subcategory a plant fits into.
A plant may have very complicated processes.

And it's

necessary for the permit issuer to study the thing and find

49

out where it is.

Sometimes, for example, you may have a

situation where one of the standards depends on the process
employed in the plant.

And you may have a plant that says,

well, our process seems to he this, but it’s really something
different.

That’s another thing that has to be —
Just as important is the permit — is the place

where the schedule of compliance is set forth.

That is, a

*

permit not only tells them how much they can discharge,
but sets forth sepcific dates by which they are to achieve
and be along the way to the accomplishments -— accomplishing
the limitations of 1977 and 1983.

That is, it will say by

such and such a date in 1979 you have to have completed this
step.

But it takes it — takes them right along the way,

and tells them what they have to do in order to achieve the
effluent limitations by the stated date.
And another thing: the permit provides various
things %^ith respect to the reports that have to be made, and
studies that have to be made by the -QUESTIOP:

Are all these variables in the permit

determined by reference to the guidelines promulgated
pursuant to Section 394, or do they come out of thin air?
HR. FRIEDHAP:
come out of thin air.

They — some — let me — they don’t
Because the Administrator himself

has promulgated a set of rather detailed guidelines that have
to be followed by every state that is authorized to have its

50

own permit program.

So a number of these things, such as the

monitoring and the reporting requirements, are set forth in
his own guidelines for the permit program.
some of them do come out of the guidelines.

IN addition,
For example,

in the hypothetical case I suggested to you, in which the
question is, which particular process is employed, and therefore
into which subcategory the plant fits? one way for determining
that would be to look at these length guidelines — huge,
thick document which is filled with a mass of technical
detail — and see on the basis of that what were the factors
that led the Administrator to conclude that there was this
category and there was that category.

And on thebasis of

those factors, the permit issuer would seek to fit it in
tothe category that the -permit issuer thinks most closely
approximates that in the guidelines.
But it’s not — I want to stress again because of
what Mr. Barnard has said, that the states have a very major
role to play in the administration of this permit program.
They’re not just sitting there and saying, okay, here's this
permit, let's see, we add it up and put it in the computer
and it comes out with numbers and write them down.

It's a

very complicated process to issue these permits, to decide
precisely what the limitations are, to set the schedules of
compliance to determine exactly what can be done and to
determine, among other things, whether the plan that this

51
particular company has proposed , the treatment processes
it intends to use, will satisfy the requirements of the guide­
lines and of the standards.

Will this really hold out promise

of accomplishing what the company is required to do?
Now, the point has been made that Section 301 is
written in the passive tense rather than the active tense,
and from that one should imply that no effluent limitations
are required to be promulgated.
I think it was employed in the passive tense

because that statute, that section, is setting out the
standards to be achieved.

enforcement, permitting citizen suits, permitting the
\

Administrator to go into the District Court.

They all speak

of enforcement of the various statutory provisions dealing with
effluent limitations.

You can enforce 301, 302, 307, 306, and

52
402. • At no point. —- at no point — is there any reference to
any enforcement of the guidelines»

The guidelines, under

their own analysis, are not enforceable.
And it seems to us totally inconsistent with the
whole statutory scheme to say that Congress intended to
enable the enforcement of the limitations in all of these
other sections, but when you came to the most vital thing of
all, the large number of existing sources that were polluting,
nothing could be done with respect to those particular sources
unless and until the general guidelines had been made effective
as to each source through a permit.
Indeed, there's no question has been raised here,
and it's conceded, that the Administrator may adopt binding
effluent limitations for these other categories, for new
sources, for toxic pollutants, for water quality standards.
It just seems so unlikely that Congress would have intended
to give him that authority, at the same time deriving him
the authority to promulgate the effective type of effluent
limitations where it was most needed in dealingwith the new
sources.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, doesn’t Mr. Barnard’s

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Let me explain why.

No, I don't think so, -Mr. Justice.

That is — Section 515 is set out at

And all that 515 requires is that

But all the committee is supposed to do is to
And then within 120 days —■ that is, 90 days

before the regulations are to be published, the committee is
to report and give the Administrator its views on how to
deal with this problem.
How, the guidelines will basically set forth
the technology, the methods of dealing with the problem,
the impact of the various proposed methods of reducing effluent
pollution on the industry.

And at that point, it seems to us,

is the place where the expert advice of the committee comes
into play.

The committee gives the Administrator the benefits

of its expert judgement on how best to deal with this problem.
Well, that is the point at which the expert advice
is needed.

Once that has been done, there would be no occasion

for the Administrator, once again, to come back to the committee
and say, okay, these are the limitations, the guidelins we5re
proposing.

How we3d like to get your expert views on whether

or not under these standards the effluent limitations for this

out of this procedure.

We don’t know what’s going to come

We have no way of knowing.

But I just want to add that part of the statutory
plan is thatthe administrator will be constantly re-examining
these matters to take advantage of new technology.

And the

way under the statute, once you get a permit, the permit is
deemed compliance with the statutory requirements for the
period of the permit.

Bo that during the normal, five year

50

period of the permit you are not in violation of the statute
even though the standards have been significantly changed.
But as technology evolves, as knowledge becomes greater,
as new processes are developed, the Administrator will be
able to change the regulations to require that as the oermits
come up for renewal the plants will be compelled and forced
to adopt the more advanced technology.
Now, I'd like to come to something on which Mr.
Barnard has repeatedly been pressing, which is that this
position that the Administrator has taken now, that he has
authority under Section 301, is a brand new notion.

This

only came into being a couple of months before the regulations
were adopted, and that, in fact, at the earliest stage, the
Administrator never dreamt that he was going to act under 301.
In the reply brief, at page 5 — that's the sort
of pinkish document — there's a quotation of two paragraphs -~
QUESTION: What page?
MR. FRTEPMAN:

'’’his was two weeks after

And this was a directive, a

request put out to various industrial and consisting firms
saying the Administrator would like them to submit proposals
as to what kind of studies they could make to help him determine
these guidelines and limitations.

And Mr. Barnard quotes and italicizes two sections
of this statute,

.And it's set forth at page 6026 of something

called the Administrative Record, which is a vast mass of
material that is on file with the Cotirt hut is not included

I’m not sure that T could carry

I know there's more than can be handled

here.
QUESTION:

Are there more than 6026 paces of this?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yeah, I'm afraid so, Mr. Justice.

Now, he doesn't italicize the first sentence of
that material.

And it's quite understandable, because what

the first sentence says is, "The Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments... requires the Environmental Protection
Agency to establish effluent limitations which must be achieved
by point sources of discharges."

And then it goes on in the

next sentence and specifies the source of that requirement,
Section 301 of the Act.
TJow, after the two paragraphs that Mr. Barnard
quotes, there's some more paragraphs to this.

And I'd like

to read two more sentences to the Court which Mr. Barnard
has not quoted.
QUESTION:

Are they in any of these briefs.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

'To, I'm afraid Mr. Justice there at

QUESTION:

That's a part of the administrative

record has been lodged with the —
MR. FRIPDMAh:

Yes, yes.

Nhat it says in the third paraaraph of this is,
in addition to his responsibilities under Section 201 and
304 of the Act, the Administrator is recruired by Section 306
■f

to announce standards for new sources.

'

*

Eo again, a recognition

early on that he had responsibilities under 301 and 304.
And then it goes on in the next paragraph, the
third

sentence of the next paragraph states: effluent

limitations guidelines under Section 301 and 304 of the Act,
and new standards of performance under Section 306, will be
developed for 27 industrial categories.
So two weeks after the statute was enacted, the
Administrator had already taken the position that he was
going to act under Section 301 and 304.
OUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, that's hardlv an unambiguous

statement by the 7\dm-in.istrator that he was goincr to issue

I Tow , their argument is, he

All he can do is issue the guide­

lines under 304 and then it's up to the permit issuers to
issue it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, what was qoincr on here

two weeks after the enactment of the Act that resulted, in
the compilation of a six thousand or so nacre administrative
record.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice,

^he six

thousand pages didn't come in two weeks after the Act.

That’s

the six thousand pages are the records in this proceedings.
This is the order in which it is set up in the record by —
two weeks after the act we didn't already have six thousand
pages of record.
QUESTION:

I thought maybe the Administrator had

taken a cue from Oongress.
[Laughter.]
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, no.

Now, there was a reference to the notice of proposed
rule-making in October, 1973.

And it was stated that all that

S3

was done in that document was merely to summarise the
statutory provisions.

But if one looks at this document,

there ai_e specific references that the Administrator was
proposing to adopt rules pursuant to Section 301, 304,
and the rest of them.
I'd like to specifically refer the Court to pages
of the Appendix — that's the brown, thick document in this
case.

At page 61 of the Appendix, it says they're going to —

notice is hereby given that effluent limitations guidelines
will be promulgated for — and then it lists all of the
subcategories in the inorganic chemical manufacturing
industry.

And it says, pursuant to sections 301, 304, 307

et cetera.
Then similar reflections contained at pages 84,
where there's a reference to technology at the bottom of
the page, last paragraph: technology based standards as
detailed in Sections 301, 304 (b) and 306„
And, finally, there's another one at —- the
proposed rule-making in October, 1973, approximately six or
seven months before the regulations finally became effective
and approximately one year after the statute became effective,
set out specific numerical affluent limitations for these
industries.
I'd just like to invite the Court’s attention to
page 110 of the Appendix, where specific numerical amounts are

64
given in connection with, the chlorine subcategory of the
chemicals industry.
So it's not just that at an early stage the
administrator indicated he was proposing to act under 301,
but that he actually, that early, a year after the Act was
passed, proposed specific limitations and gave everybody in
the industry the opportunity to comment on them.

The record

contains a number of objections by industry, including the
chemical industry, to these proposals, including the complaint
that they shouldn't specify a precise numerical limitations,
that it should be put in terms of a range, that they should
promulgate guidelines, and various factors.
And we think that this does reflect a consistent
administrative interpretation, that here's a case in a
complicated statute where the Administrator whose charged
with setting the thing in motion early on concluded that
he should deal with this problem gander Section 301 and 304.
Now, what the Administrator — under the statute
the Administrator was directed to promulgate the guidelines
within one year.

This proved to be an impossible task.

Just the sheer magnitude of it, the studies that had to be
made of all these industries.

He couldn't do it.

7vnd

what he did, rather than promulgate, first, guidelines, and
then effluent limitations, was he combined the two steps
•:!

into a single proceeding.

And at the end of this proceeding

!■

65
he .issued virtually simultaneously the guidelines, the
actual limitations, for existing sources and for new sources»
And this seemed to us a preeminently practical
method of handling it.

knew exactly what he was proposing to do.

They

They had full

opportunity to comment on it twice, because the Administrator.
herefollowed a rather unusual procedure.

He first published

:a notice of — a proposed notice of proposed rule-making
and let them comment on that.

And then after they'd gotten

comments on.that> then he put out a notice of proposed
rule-making.

Then he got comments on .that, and finally he

»

....

adopted the rules.

I mean, it's really giving them more

procedural protection than they -— that was required.
The argument is made that these regulations are
defective because they don't provide ranges.

How, that

argument of course — and also, they don't provide ranges
and they don't specify the various factors that the permit
issuer is to take into account really in applying the ranges
to the particular plant.

That, of course, is just another

way of arguing, I think, that the Administrator can promulgate
l

binding effluent limitations.

But to the extent — and I

add that there's nothing in the statute that speaks about

66

ranges that all.

The two references in the committee report

to ranges, we think that the ranges, to the extent that they
are required, are provided by the Act of dividing the industries
into subcategories on the basis of particular processes,
particular plants, particular types of equipment used.
And, for example, Mr. Mr. Barnard was complaining
that one of the facets to be taken into account is age.
And he said that age of a plant cannot be put into the
formulation of the regulations. . Well, in at least one industry
they have broken down on the basis of age.

In the electric

power industry, one subcategory is new plants and another
subcategory is old plants, the recognition that there are
different problems in controlling pollution in different
types of plants.
Now, the specification of factors: vre think all
that that requires is that the Administrative guidelines
specify the factors that are to he applied under the
effluent limitations? that is, on what basis is the
Administrator going to set the precise numbers,

.And that,

we think, is precisely what he has done here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, could I ask a fairly

basic question that's running through my mind?
Assume for a moment the other side is right, and
that the action taken under 301 is a complete nullity, there
are no legally enforceable regulations under 301? that the

67
action taken under 304 is not self-enforcing but just some
kind of a general guide, and you’ve done that»

Does it

really make any difference, if everybody already has a
permit, pursuant to 402?
MR, FRIEDMAN;

Yes, it makes a great deal of dif~*

i ference, Mr. Justice, because these permits are only for
five years.

And when the permits start expiring in the

next two or three years, and when the question then comes,
how should they be changed to reflect the improvements in
technology, it seems to me you8re going to open up a hornet’s
nest there.
QUESTION:

The difference would he, I take it,

that when renewal time comes, instead of renewing the basic
set of rules in one single proceeding, you’d have to review
a multitude of permit applications.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

That’s the basic thing we’re fighting

about, is that correct?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is the basic thing, that under

our system —
QUESTION:

The other side of the coin, if you’re

right and they’re wrong, how are they hurt?

As of now?

It doesn’t really make any difference today, it just makes a
difference on renewal.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I suppose they may not be

68

hurt now, except to the extent — I don't know, I haven't
thought about this, whether the invalidation of effluent
limitations would do something to the permits that have been
issued.

It may be that if the permits were —
QUESTION:

Why?

If they’re in accordance with the

guidelines and they've been issued by the man who has the
authority to sign the permits, what difference does it make?
I don't see how the validity of any already issued permits
can possibly be affected by this proceeding.

Now, maybe

I missed something very obvious, but I just don’t quite see
that.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I suspect not, but I’m sure an

attack would be mounted on the permits.
QUESTION:

And also —

Well, Mr. Friedman, I suppose there

could be a range of permits that could be issued.
one

of them consistent with the guidelines.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

again would depend, if —
QUEST IGT7:

And if a specific factor that the

Administrator had prescribed, he had no power to prescribe,
and where the state might have issued a permit — a completely
different permit but it was still consistent with the
guidelines — I suppose there would be an industry that would
rather have the state issue a new permit than to keep the old
one.

69

MR o FRIEDMAN:

If that5 s open to them.

That*, it

seems to me, would be. productive of some rather extensive and
difficult litigation if that happened»

Because X'rn sure they

would contend that somehow the permits,, even though in
compliance -with the guidelines, that the were issued not in
compliance with the guidelines but in compliance with the
effluent limitations, and if the effluent limitations are
involved, I think they would then argue that —

Yeah, but Mr. Friedman, this document

is a hybrid, it's a 301-304 kind of document.

Then they would have had to go back to the district

I suppose sov although they make

the argument that if they prevail that you shouldn't send
it back to the district court, that you should allow to stand
the portions of the Court of Appeals' decision that have

70

invalidated some of the regulations»
The Court of Appeals in this case, in addition —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see, they had jurisdiction pursuant

to the new source aspect»

.And then they argued its pendant

jurisdiction —■
HR, FRIEDMAN:

They argue that there’s pendant

jurisdiction which is — we say that in the particular
circumstances of this case, if that should be the outcome,
it would be sort of futile to send it back to the district
court which would undoubtedly follow the views of the Court
of Appeals»
But in the meantime, of the 22 regulations that
are involved in this case, 11 of them have been reversed on
various grounds and sent back to EPA for further study»

And

those are at the present time in the course of study.

if there is no pendant jurisdiction, then the entire judgement
of the Court of Appeals has to be wiped out.

goes back to the district court, but the district court,

There's no — the only

issues before this court are the authority of the Administrator
to establish these binding effluent limitations, and the
validity which I'll come to in a moment, the subject of our

Let me just quote one or two.

The conference

report -- there were differences in the House and Senate
bill, which we've quoted at page 60 of this brief — said
that the conferees contend that the Administrator or the
state, as the case may be, will make the determination of
the economic impact of an effluent limitation on the
basis of classes and categories of point sources as distinguished
from a plant by plant determination, clearly<• we think s
contemplating an effluent limitation to be established for
a class or category of source.
And then in the House bill quoted at the top of
page 63, the House report says that all reports issued under
this program shall be consistent with the specific requirements
of the bill including effluent limitations or other limitations.
Once againe a clear recognition that effluent, limitations
are something other than and separate from the provisions
in this permit.
Now, let me turn to the question presenting in our
>

'

cross-petition, which is the requirement of the Court of
Appeals that for new sources there have to be a variance
procedure.

The statute in Section 306 (b) directs the

Administrator to establish by regulation federal standards
of performance for new sources within each industrial
category.

And the standard for those — the standard of

that is the best available demonstrated technology.

And it

75
said, including where practicable a standard permitting
no discharge of pollutants.

That is* Congress hoped that

when you dealt with new sources as distinguished from
existing sources, the administrator v?ould be able to find that
there was sufficient available technology to permit no dis­
charge at all.
It's illegal after these standards of performance
have been promulgated for any new source to operate in
violation of the standard.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, let me ask you a question

about the cross-petition.

Is it possibly premature — in

other words, you criticise a part of the Court of Appeals
opinion, but is there anything in its order that really will
be affected by our judgmental processes?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Qh, yes, yes.

It's remanded to —

and it's directed — the Administrator is directed at pages
262 and 263 of the record to come forward with some limited
escape mechanism for new sources.
statement that they should be.

It’s not just a general

It said they should be,

and they say to the Administrator, and you're directed to
provide it.

It*s told the Administrator to work out some

scheme whereby new sources can have an escape mechanism.
If this decision stands on the remand, he's got
to come up with some variance procedure for new sources.
Now, the Court of Appeals recognized that both

76
under the statute 301 (c) for the 1983 sources» and under
the administrative regulations for the 1977 sources there
is a variance provision.

The Court recognized also that

there Is no comparable thing for new sources.

But nevertheless

it concluded that a variance procedure should also be pre­
sumptively applicable — I'm sorry# that the new source
standards like the existing source standards would be
presumptively applicable and that there should be some
variance provision.
This rather significantly is something the Court
of Appeals did on its own.

The petitioners didn't ask the

Court of Appeals to do this# the Court did it itself.

And

we challenge that# because we don’t think that Congress ever
intended there should be a variance provision for new sources.
We think the reason is there's a basic difference between
getting existing sources into compliance and net? sources.
When you deal with an existing source» improving
it# bringing it up to standards# can be a very complicated#
time consuming and expensive procedure.
a host of problems.

There are all sorts —

The Administrator# when he dealt with

the existing sources# promulgated the limitations on the
basis of a particular subcategory.

And inevitably in that

process he could not take account of particular problems
that were unique to a particular plant.
And therefore it would be fundamentally unfair

7?
to require a particular plant with unique problems to observe
the general effluent standards and limitations that are
applied to all members of this sub-industrial category»
And for that reason the Administrator concluded that there
should be a variance.

This is also reflected in the

statutory provision for a variance under 1983 sources.
But when you’re dealing with a. new plant, it seems
to us you have a very different situation facing you.

To

begin with, by definition there’s no requirement of a plant
making any changes.

Secondly, the new plant, when it’s being

built, has much greater freedom to adopt new technologies,
not having to take its existing operation and change it,
but starting afresh.

And it's not only more feasible, andnot

only better able to do this, but it's usually likely to be
a lot cheaper.
The standard that Congress directed to be set for
new standards

new sources — is the best available

demonstrated control technology.

And there's no reason why,

if a plant is being constructed from scratch, it can't comply
with that.

This is the best way to control pollution.

When

you — you've got a tremendous problem in getting existing
sources to comply, and to cut down on their discharges to
accomplish the achievement of these objectives.

But when

yoii're dealing with a plant, that hasn't been constructed
with a new source, the best way to avoid any growth of

78
pollution is to make sure that the new source complies with
these strict standards,

Indeed, the hope was — the hope

was in Congress that in the case of new sources, the standard
would be no discharge at all.
And we think that what Congress contemplated in
Section 306 was that for a new source, unless it could comply
with these strict effluent limitations, it shouldn’t be built
at all.

That is, Congress adopted a different approach when

it was dealing with correcting existing sources and permitting
new sources.
Now, 306, with its very explicit saying that no
plant

no new source shall be — shall operate except in

compliance with these standards is in sharp contrast with
some other provisions of the statute which do explicitly
permit but not require the Administrator to grant waivers.
Reference has already been made to Section 301 (c)
with the waiver of the permit requirement.

Section 316 (a)

permits the Administrator to waive the requirements of both
Sections 301 and 306 for particular plant for a single aspect
of pollution, local thermal pollution, the discharge of heat
into the water, if he finds that compliance to the thermal
pollution standard is unnecessary to protect wildlife.
And finally we refer you to Section 313 of the
Act.

That’s the provision requiring federal facilities to

comply with all of the standards.

And that section permits

79
the president to grant a one year waiver from any of the
requirements of state and federal pollution standards if
he determines that it's in the paramount interest of the
United States for any federal facility to have such a waiver
except that he cannot even do that with respect to either
new source standards under 306 or toxic pollutants under
307.
And it seems to us that if the Congress didn't
even permit the President to waive compliance with the
new source standards for federal facilities when he was
able to conclude it was in the paramount interest of the
United States to do so, he certainly didn't intend to permit
the Administrator to do this in the case of new sources
%

merely because they said they couldn't really comply, it
would be very laborious, very difficult for them to comply
with the existing standards.
The legislative history confirms this interpretation
we think.

In the committee report of the House, which we

cited at page 15 of our brief, the committee listed on of the
two most significant factors in the attainment of clean water,
and I quote, the need to preclude the construction of new
sources which use less than the best available control
technology for the reduction or elimination of discharge of
pollutants.

And that word, to preclude the construction of

new sources which use less than the bast available technology,

80

is the precise standard written into Section 306 for new
sources.
Now, let me just briefly refer to the jurisdictional
issue —
QUESTION:

Could I just ask you a question here?

In the 8th Circuit, where you had an unfavorable decision?
HRo FRIEDMAN 3
QUESTION:

Yes.

Who was prescribing these specific

effluent standards, in thosesfcates, in the 8th Circuit?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In the 8th Circuit?

Well, the

specific standards were written by the Administrator.
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

But didn't the 8th

Circuit decide that he had no authority under 301 to write
the specific-—
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
in that Circuit?

Under 301, that's

right.

Well, then, who — how about permits

Has that decision been stayed or what?

Or have permits bean issued by state authorities using —
specifying their own effluent standards consistent with the
guidelines?
MR. FRIEDF1AN:
Justice.

I cannot answer that question, Mr.

I'll be happy to get the answer and furnish it to

you.
QUESTION:

Because I suppose if you win, those

permits, there's some cloud on them, is there not?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t know.

I'll have to get that

information, Mr. Justice, and forward if -to you.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Now, on the jurisdictional question,

as I understand now, there’s no disagreement between us and
the petitioners that if the Administrator has the authority
which we say he has, and which he consistently said he has
under 301, they concede as they have to, first, that the
Court of Appeals has
limitations.

jurisdiction to review the

effluent

And second, they also apparently now agree

that as an incident to review of the effluent limitations,
the guidelines also may be reviewed.

That — there was

some uncertainty at an earlier stage of litigation precisely
what their argument is.
Now, as I understand, there argument is only that
if it be held that the Administrator does not have authority
under Section 301 then the guidelines standing alone are to
be reviewed in the district courts.

And they take the

further position that if the Administrator doesn’t have
the authority under Section 301, that if a suit has been
brought in the Court of Appeals challenging the exist —
the new source standards which by definition are reviewable
only in the Court of Appeals, then the guidelines can
come in under pendant jurisdiction.
It's a very involved question.

We hope the Court

82

doesn't have to face it,

Of course, if the Court agrees with

us, they don51»
If the Court

should reject our submission on

this t we would suggest to the Court along the lines of the
Court of Appeals in this case that even if it ware to hold
that the Administrator has nc authority under 301, nevertheless
a close relationship between the 301 standards and the 304
guidelines would make it appropriate that the Court of
Appeals should nonetheless have jurisdiction to review the
guidelines.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BARNARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BARNARD:

Your honor, I realise it's late.

May I just take a minute or so?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have six minutes of

your time, and we'll hear you out.
MR. BARNARD:

I hope I don't need to take it.

Mr. Friedman referred to a quotation from our
request — a quotation from a request for an application by
a contractor that was quote in part in our brief.
I will confess tothe Court that the paragraphs
that he quoted we eliminated on the grounds of brevity.
But we asked the Court to look at them.

And we suggest the

03

Court also look at the contract as it was finally issued»
There’s a notice that the contract requires the contractor
to put into his report — it appears on page 6424 of the
record»

Happily, it’s reprinted in the final document in

the form of a notice called an abstract that appears in the
front of the development document, which is the form of a
notice.

And it says that the regulations that this document

is designed to assist in developing effluent limitations
guidelines for existing point sources and standards of
performance, and pre-treatment standards for new sources,
to implement sections 304,306, and 307 of the Act.

There is

no reference to Section 3.01.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnard, you don't want us to read

that whole 6,000 pages?
MR. BARNARD:

No, sir,

I don’t think you need to.

something an Administrator can do.

If we. don't follow that

approach, we're going to have an awful lot of review
proceedings on individual permits.
MR. BARNARD:

Barnard, governed by the 8th Circuit.judgement?

Have states

issuance has gone forward despite this with the permit
officers working out within the context of what, they under­

are the required limitations to be put into a permit.
I’ra sorry, your honor.
QUESTIONS
Mr. Barnard.

Well, let. me just make one other point,

Is it not true that the effect of the Rth

Circuit holding was to invalidate the EPA's action insofar
as it relied on Section 301?
MR. BARNARD:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But not to touch it insofar as it

relied on 304, which provided the guidelines which would
justify further issuance of permits.
MR. BARNARD:

That’s correct, your honor.

Thank you, your honor.
