P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

W« will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 75-6521.. Abney and others against
the United States.
Mr. Samuel, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH DAVID SAMUEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAMUEL;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleases the

Court;
i.

This case involves Petitioners* claim -that the
double jeopardy clause bars their retrial after reversal of
their conviction on a duplicitous indictment for violation of
the Hobbs Act.
The Petitioners were tried and convicted on a
duplicitous indictment which charge, in one count, two separate
offenses;

conspiracy and attempt to violate the Hobbs Act.
Thereafter, they appealed to the Third Circuit. Court

of Appeals, which reversed on other grounds, and remanded for
retrial.
Three, times during the trial, the initial trial of
tills case, Petitioners moved to require the government to elect
to proceed on one prong or the other of the duplicitous
indictment.

This the government steadfastly refused to do.

But for the government*s steadfast refusal, this case would

not be here -today.

4
How that the case has been remanded for retrial;, 'die
government proposes to retry these Petitioners on die
conspiracy- prong of die duplicitous indictment.

There are

substantial problems with retrying these petitioners on -the
conspiracy prong,- one of which is the indictment as now framed
simply fails to state a federal offense»

The indictment now

charges conspiracy to commit attempted extortion, something
which simply isn’t a crime under the Hobbs Act.
The other problem, of course, is that retrying these
Petitioners on one prong of the duplicitous indictment will
expose them to double jeopardy.
The Petitioners ~
QUESTION:

Is there an issue of appealability in

here?

•»
MR» SAMUEL:

Your Honor, I will get to that shortly»

QUESTION: Well, isn’t that die threshold issue

of.

j uri. s di cti on?
MR. SAMUEL:

The Petitioners appealed their --

QUESTION: Well, isn't it the threshold issue usually,
the jurisdictional question?
MR. SAMUEL:

In this case, the Third Circuit

Court of Appeals properly, we believe, took jurisdiction of the
appeal from the motions to dismiss the indictment.
QUESTION:
MR. SAMUEL:

Now

Do you have some authority for that?
In this Court the government has raised

the question of jurisdiction, and I will direct ray self to that:
question»
The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act confers on the
Courts of Appeals

jurisdiction to hear final decisions of

-the district courts, a well known act.

Wa believe,, and we

believe that there is substantial precedent for the idea that
the denial of the notion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds
is in fact a final decision, and that the Court of Appeals
properly assumed jurisdiction over that question.
This Court, in Harris v. Washington, addressed a
substantially similar issue, and held that the Court had proper
jurisdiction under 28 IJ.S.C. Section 1251, the standards of
which have been held, or have been approached by this Court
on the same basis as the standards of finality under Section
1291.
QUESTIONs
MR. SAMUEL:
QUESTION:

Was that a criminal case?
That was a criminal case, Your Honor.
In that the State appellate system had

permitted appellate review of the dismissal order, and isn't
that really the question here, whether the federal appellate
system permits review at all?
MR. SAMUEL:

The case is not dissimilar because the

federal appellate system permitted review only by a writ of
prohibition in the intermediate State court.

Here, obviously,

the Court of Appeals would have the power to entertain a motion

6
for a writ of prohibition.

So that there was no special

appellate statute involved in that case.
QUESTIONs

Well, but if there's a policy against

piecemeal appeals in the federal system, that policy nav or
may not be followed by the States, and if they have chosen to
allow their process to be interrupted by appeallate review
on this kind of an issue, that's up to them? but I take it the:
argument on the other side is that the federal policy is
against that sort of thing?
MR. SAMUELs

Well, I ‘think that the discussion by

Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Cobble dick case is particularly
appropriate hare, where he noted that the right to statutory
appeal must not be interpreted in such a way as to deny all
opportunity for appeal under — contemplated by the statutes.
In other words,

he said exactly s

"Due regard for efficiency

in litigation must not be carried so far as to deny all
opportunity for the appeal contemplated by the statutes”.
Now, tee nature of the protection in a double
jeopardy clause is such that it creates the statutory right
to appeal.
Thera is no decision more final than tee decision of
a trial court cutting off a double jeopardy claim. The only
evanfc looming on the horizon of the accused at that point, is
the second trial.

The issues are completely dissimilar.

The issues on the question of double jeopardy and the issue

7
to be tried in the second trial.
QUESTION°

Hr. .Samuel, you're just abandoning the

language of the Fifth Amendment, it doesn't say you can't be
convicted, but that you shall not be pit in jeopardy,

it

doesn't say yon shall not be convicted.
MR. SAMUEL:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I agree —

QUESTIONS Are you going to get to that?
MR. SAMUEL:

— with that.

That the nature of the

protection again is based on the Fifth Amendment, which
bars a second trial, and this Court, has so held in a long
lin© of cases, from Ex -parte Lange through United States vs.
Ball, and most recently in United States vs. Dinitz.
that sense it is a very special type of protection.

In
It.

involves a decision of the district court, whether or not to
violate the protection, and there really is no other
constitutional protection quite like that.
If any decision is final, this one should be, in
light of, for instance, Stack vs. Boyle, where this Court held
that the question of bail could be appealed pretrial, because
it was a final decision.

And that it was collateral and did

not. merge with the trial issue.
Here we have the same type of situation.

The

question of double jeopardy does not merge, it is a collateral,
issue, and the issues — there are no facts required to be
adduced at trial to bear on this issue,.

All of the necessary

8
record facte are before the Court.
The government has become apparently quite concerned
about the jurisdictional issue, and I note recently that Judge
Friendly, in the Second Circuit, has written an extensive
opinion in which he discusses the question of jurisdiction.
I would be arguing with blinders on if I were not -did not take cognizance of the concern of the courts that
granting the right of appeal from this type of decision would
open the floodgates, arid that every criminal defendant would
immediately file a double jeopardy claim.
1 think that that analysis misses a very important
distinction, and that distinction is between the appellate
jurisdiction, that is, the question is s

Does the appeals

court have jurisdiction to entertain and to hear these cases,
which we argue on the one hand, and the question of whether or:
not every defendant has a right to have his trial stayed?
Which is really a separate question.
And the practice is today, in the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania, where this case arose, that the courts do
not consider that every appellant, has a right to have his trial
stayed, and that the appellant must seek a stay based on the
merits of having a substantial double jeopardy claim.
And of course that really has kept the floodgates
from opening, because tee government has only been able to
point to ten cases in which appeals have been entertained in

9
four years, since Dansdown was decided in the Fourth Circuit,
which created initially the —• or held initially that, this was
the final decision appropriate for appellate review.
QUESTIONS

Have you calculated the amount of delay

that was involved in -those ten cases, before they went to
trial?
MR. SAMUELs

Mr. Chief Justice, I have not sac. down

with a calculator and attempted to see the amount of delay
involved in those cases.

But, given the extensive case load

of the federal district courts in criminal cases, I think that
ten cases in four years really represents a very small number
of cases, and the amount of delay involved is not overbearing,
and again the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter I think are
very appropriate,

that the "due regard for efficiency in

litigation must not be carried so far as to deny all
opportunity for the appeal contemplated by the statutes".
But even if ~~
QUESTION:

When you reduce it to statistics, than

what happened to these ten cases that went up on the inter­
locutory appeal?
MR. SAMUEL:

In most of them, the Courts of Appeals

found against them on the merits.
QUESTION:
MR. S;. t-EL:

Most of them or all of them?
I believe there is one in which they

found for the petitioners on the merits.

1C
Nevertheless, a judge at soma point in the proceedings
made a decision, as in these proceedings, that there was a
serious double jeopardy question involved, and either a stay
was issued or the court took no steps to move forward with
the trialo
NoXTf in the Ales si. case, the Ales, si II case, which
on which Judge Friendly has written his lengthy opinion,
the case was scheduled to -go forward with trial, and finally,
I assume that Judge Friendly is the judge who granted the writ
of prohibition, stopping the trial in that case.

And there

there was not — there wasn't even a double jeopardy claim,
it was a due process claim based on a plea bargaining which
the defendant had —
QUESTION;

And what dc you argue from Judge

Fxlendly*s opinion?
MR. SAMUEL;

Well, —

QUESTION; Thai; it is appealable, or that it isn't?
MR. SAMUEL:

That Judge Friendly * s opinion in

Alessi is appealable to this Court?
QUESTION:

Or —

Well, what do you argue from Judge

Friendly's opinion as to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeals in this case?
MR. SAMUEL:

Oh, I think that the jurisdiction •

that

the; Court in Ales si did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal,
never-the less-, it was not necessary for the judge to enter a

13.
stay or to grant the writ of prohibition in staying the trial.
He must have thought that there was a serious issue
that had to be dealt with before doing that.
QUESTION; Well, I take it also that even if there
was jurisdiction to review the double jeopardy issue in -the
Court of Appeals, it doesn't necessarily mean that the
duplicity issue would piggy-back on that.
MR. Samuels

Well, Mr. Justice White, the duplicity

issue, I think is — well, the duplicity issue and the double
jeopardy issue are really one and the sane.
QUESTION;

Becaute® if it weren't, if the double

jeopardy question weren't there, you certainly wouldn't argue
that the duplicity issue was appealable by itself.
MR. SAMUEL;

In this case the Third Circuit found

that there was duplicity.
QUESTION; Well, would you ox' not?
MR. SAMUELs

Well, I believe that the pendent issue

here is the failure of the indictment to state an offense,
’

QUESTION;
MR. SAMUELs
QUESTION;

All right.

Take that one too, then.

All right.
How about the denial of a notion to

dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense?
is that an appealable issue or not?
MR. SAMUEL;
issue by itself.

Well, tinis

Now,

By itself.
that is not an appealable

But this Court has held, in a series of

1
cases that where a pendent issue is raised with a properly
if
raised appealable issue, that the Court -■■/a decision of that
pendent issue will have the effect of terminating the litiga~
tion, that the Court will reach that issue.
And the reason is -that the consideration of
efficiency and avoidance of piecemeal review are turned
aroundf once there is a proper appeal.

And at that point,

those cons: .derations militate in favor of granting the
motion to dismiss, or whatever terminating action the Court
may take.

That is precisely the case that we have here.
Here the district court thought there was a serious

double jeopardy claim and granted a stay.

It went up on

appeal, we believe properly, and we raised once again the
failure of the indictment to state an offense, and we submit
that was raised properly under Rule 12(b) , because it can be
raised at any stage of th© proceedings, like jurisdictional.
QUESTIONS To put it bluntly, if we decide that
is no double jeopardy point here, we then move to the
other one?
MR. SAMUELs
th

Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that

decisions of the Court support the idea that even though

the properly raised issue is decided against, on the merits e

ox the Court feels that it is not sufficiant on the merits,
that it can still reach the pendent issue.
QUESTION; So that now any time you fail to gat. an

13

indictment dismissed, you just say double jeopardy, and
automatically it's appealable?
MR. SAMUEL:

I think that there ~~ the question, as

1 said before, there * s a division in the question between
whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, and we
say that there it does.
QUESTION: Well, would they have jurisdiction in that
case?
MR. SAMUEL: They would certainly have jurisdiction,
we argue, to review any double

jeopardy claim.

Nevertheless,

QUESTION: And then they find that there was no
double jeopardy claim.
MR. SAMUEL:

That's right.

QUESTION: Then they go to the other one?
MR. SAMUEL:

The Court has the discretion to do so,

it does not have to, there is no requirement.
QUESTION: And where does it get that discretion?
MR. SAMUEL: This Court has held —
QUESTION 5 From the fact that you allege double
jeopardy.
MR. SAMUEL; That’s right.
QUESTION: And no more.
MR. SAMUEL:

That's right.

QUESTION; Well, that's horrible law.
MR. SAMUEL: But, nevertheless, Mr. Justice Marshall,

14
QUESTION:

You don’t have anything to back you up

on that# do you?
MR. SAMUEL:
followed.

The discretion does not have to be

It is simply a matter of discretion,, whether or

not to reach the pendent issue# whether or not to even
consider it.
QUESTION s

I thought that this case raised the

question# the important question of whether or not you could
appeal feh© denial of -the double jeopardy point# without
getting involved with the rest of it.
MR. SAMUEL:
QUESTION:

Am I wrong?

Mr. Justice Marshall# the petition —
If we give you relief on the double

jeopardy# what do you need the other one for?
MR. SAMUEL:

In the petition we raised both issues.

We raised both issues •»QUESTION s Why do you need them?
MR. SAMUEL:
the double jeopardy
pendent issue.

It is true that if we have relief on
clause# we do not need relief on the

Nevertheless, because the indictment in this

case does not state an offense# that is# as it is now framed#
because it charges something which is not a crime under the
Hobbs Act at all, we think that that is such a glaring error

i-

V-'.e ' ®

that this Court# exercising its discretion#

should -reach that issue and require that it —
QUESTIQNs Well# suppose you have a grand jury

15

indictment with two grand jurors in it, could you bring that
one up?

Straight?
MRo SAMUELs

QUESTIONS

Ah, -No, you would have to go through a trial,

wouldn't you?
MR0 SAMUEL s
QUESTIONs
MR» SAMUEL:
would,

Right —
Wouldn’t you?
The finality -- I believe that you

The finality decision here -- question here is really

— goes to where there is a double jeopardy question, which
has been raised.
Now, deciding that the Courts of Appeals have
jurisdiction to hear the denial of the double

jeopardy

claim does not mean that they will hear every double jeopardy
claim.

It means, because in most cases, where there is a

frivolous claim raised, it will be rendered moot.
By the time the Court of Appeals reaches the issue, the
second trial will have taken place,
QUESTIONS

Do you also raise the question of a

denial of a bill of particulars, or something like that?
MR, SAMUEL*

I don't think so.

The constitutional

protection, the nature of the protection of the Fifth
Amendment is a special, very special type of protection.
It requires the Court to makes a prospective decision as to
whether or not the Constitution will be violated

16

There ,is no other procedural constitutional right
in criminal law that is quite like that.
Now, should the Court nevertheless find that no
double jeopardy

* 'that no appellate jurisdiction existed

in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to review of this issue,
we believe that, nevertheless, the Court of Appeals could
have reached the issue under its mandamus power.
There is a long line of decisions which holds that
if an appeal was improvidently filed in the Court of Appeals,
that the Court of Appeals may treat it as a petition for
mandamus if the issue was appropriate for mandamus review,
and —
QUESTION% But, Mr. Samuel, here the Court of Appeals

did not do that.
HR. SAMUELz

That's correct,

it did not.

Nevertheless, we feel -that since the issue was one
appropriate for mandamus review, or would have been, that 'the
Court of Appeals could have reached it, and, accordingly,
since they did pass on the merits, that; under the rule in
fvt[tic Engineering & Manufmaturing Company

KS.

V3»

Dings

.n the

f

d Circuit, and Hackefct vs. General Host Corporation in the

Third Circuit, in which cert- was denied in 1972, that the
Court; of Appeals — that this Court can reach the me rite
because the Court of Appeals would have had mandamus power to
do so.

And it could have done it without requiring that; the

17

Petitioners file a writ; a petition for writ of mandamus,
the Third Circuit could have don© this.»
QUESTIONs Would that involve a judgment, on our part,
as to how the Third Circuit should have exercised, its
discretionary power to grant or deny mandamus?
MR0 SAMUEL?

The cases,, the Circuit Court cases

that deal with this, involve questions where there is a
patently obvious issue, which is available for mandamus
review»

I think that in tills case we have such a case, and

therefore, since it meets the criteria, that the short answer
iss

Yes, it would require a decision, but that the decision

is a formality.
QUESTION:

Well, but the court — you're referring

to Courts of Appeals cases, where the same court in which the
appeal was. filed says "No, we don't have appellate juris­
diction, but we choose to treat it as a petition for mandamus
and exercise our jurisdiction to allow it."
If you ask us to do that, it’s one level removed,
because you would say, we’re saying the Court of Appeals has
no jurisdiction, but that it should have exercised its
dis cretionary jurisdiction»
MR. SAMUEL:

I don’t deny that's the case.

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals did reach the merits in
tills case on an appeal, and that the merits of the case are
such that they are patently the kind of issue which mandamus

18
will reach.

That is, that the district court, in denying the

motion to dismiss here, held that he had no basis to roach
the merits following the Third Circuit's opinion after the
appeal of the first trial.

He felt that the Third Circuit

opinion precluded him from reaching the merits, and made his
decision accordingly.
Now{

we

think that’s an abdication of nisi prius

jurisdiction, that the issue of double jeopardy had not been,
argued, brief, or decided by the Third Circuit? and,
accordingly, that this is a case appropriate for mandamus
review by the Third Circuit on its face.
Turning to the double jeopardy argument itself, the
Third Circuit, in

reviewing the decision, the indictment,

held that it was duplicitous, and. noted the evils of a
duplicitous indictment.

These are confusion and ambiguity.

These are well know, they have been set forth in a whole line
of cases.
The principal evil of a duplicitous indictment is
•that it requires the jury to answer two separate questions with
cue yes or no answer, something which is almost beyond the
scope of logic.
Accordingly, a guilty verduct under such an indict*»
meat is capable of various equally possible interpretations.
Ow

such interpretation is that the jury found the defendants

not guilty of the conspiracy charge.

And we believe that

19
because of the presumption of innocence that we must adopt
the most favorable of the squally possible interpretations ,
that being that the defendants were found not guilty of the
charge on which they are now sought to be retried by the
government»
That presents a clear double jeopardy situation, and
their retrial should be barred»
The government argues in its brief that the act of
appealing to the Third Circuit from the first

conviction

wipes clean the slaia and thus prohibits the double jeopardy
claim from being raised»
Nevertheless, this is not that type of situation»
That is the general rule, and it is a general rule which
exists, and we agree with»

This is a situs,tion where the

Petitioners claim that they were acquitted of toe conspiracy
charge the first time around, talcing the — adopting the most
favorable interpretation of this ambiguous guilty verdict.
Accordingly, appeal from the first conviction
cannot have toe effect of wiping clean an acquittal.

It

simply cannot b© done.
Once acquitted, the Petitioners are forever barred
from having to stand trial a second time on the same charge.
The government also argues that the charge of the

district court, at the trial court on to© first trial, cured
tor: infirmity of toe indictment.

The government cites no

20

law for this proposition»

It seems that it is completely

unfounded and, moreover, the charge of the court, which is
set forth in full, beginning at page 11 of Ida© Appendix,
demonstrates beyond peradventure that the charge of the court
was just as confusing as the indictment itself.
Accordingly, we request that this Court hold that
the Court of Appeals had proper appellate jurisdiction to
review the dismissal

» the denial of the motion to dismiss,

reverse toe Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to
dismiss toe indictment.
Thank you,

I’d lik© to reserve a couple of minutes

for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

Mr o Thornburgh.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. THORNBURGH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. THORNBURGHs

Mr. chief Justice, may it pleas©

the Courts
Since toe government deems the issue of appealability
to bo the most important of those raised in. this case, I would
lik© to defer the statement of our position on th© other
substantive issues unless, and until, th© Court otherwise
desires.
It's the position of the government in this case
that

the interruption of th© trial process by the Third Circuit

21
Court of Appeals was not justified.

That Court was without

jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order denying dismissal
on double jeopardy grounds before the case was retried,
following its reversal»
The right to appeal is a statutory one, not a
constitutional right.

It arises in this case under the

provisions of Title 28 United States Code, Section 1291, which
provides for a right of appeal only of final decisions in
the district court.
As pointed out in our brief, -QUESTION;

Mr. Thornburgh, is if. not correct that

til© district court has made a final decision on the question
whether the defendant must stand ferial?
MR. THORNBURGH;

I think in the colloquial sense,

final decisions are made by the district court in a whole
panoply of matters in the course of hearing a trial.

The

question is whether it is a final decision as the courts have
inlirpretcd that phrase under 1291»

And I would suggest that

beginning with a line of authority that’s found in the He ike
case, that in matters respecting double jeopardy there has
bfex-sn, wife}:, the exception of the cases that bring us here today
from Circuit Courts, a recognition by this Court that a double
jeopardy claim denial is not final, a final decision for the
purposes ©f being appealable.
QUESTION:

Well, hew do you remedy the fact that the

22

man is put in jeopardy?

Which is the language in the Fifth

Amendment»
MR, THORNBURGH:
QUESTION:

I would submit that *—

How do you prevent a court from violating

MR. THORNBURGHS

Well, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall#

what w© are talking about her©, and it's important, X think,

MR. THORNBURGH: There is a right —
QUESTION:

Is the right to a speedy trial

explicit

in the Constitution?
MR. THORNBURGH:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

If the court denies a motion to dismiss

for want of a speedy trial, is that in -the same sense final
in judgment as the. double jeopardy is final?
MR. THORNBURGH:

The Fourth Circuit has so held,

and that case is of great concern to the government, with
regard to the finality doctrine.

I think that with respect

to the double jeopardy issue, I recognise that the Courts of
Appeals have

succumbed to what Judge Friendly refers to as

tbs seductive argument, that the right of not being placed in
jeopardy twice is not a meaningful right unless it. has a
handmaiden of pretrial appeal to accompany it.

24
But I think that that represents a misreading of
•the lines of authority that have been developed in this Court?
not only under the Cohen doctrine of collateral decisions? but
the State cases which are relied upon by Petitioners here*
With respect to Cohen? that case was really the
first breach in the application of the finality doctrine?
and when you look at the facte of that case? which involved a
shareholder suit upon which the — with respect to which th©
district court had to decide a question ©f costs on the
petitioner? and that question was then reviewed in tee appellate
courts? this Court, found ultimately in Cohen? in its decision?
that that was one of what they styled a small class of
cases? where a determination is made of claims of right which
are separable from and collateral to the rights asserted in
that particular civil action*

That it was too important to

be denied review and? in fact, would be lost? itself? if it
were not decided at teat time.
Its- analogue in tee criminal area is Stack v. Boyle?
involving a determination of bail in a criminal case.
QUESTION;

Mr. Thornburgh? just before you

Again —
™

f«to

that? why won't the right not to be tried a second time be
irrevocably lost if it is not protected right at this very
point?
Why doesn’t that reasoning apply here?
MR. THORNBURGHs

Well? I think ~~

25

QUESTIONs

In other words, why doesn't Cohen fit

this case like a glove?
If on© can say that Cohen's theory applies to the
criminal side.
MRo THORNBURGHs

Because I don't think the double

jeopardy issue is separable from and collateral to the rights
that are asserted in the action.

The double jeopardy issue

is part and parcel of the entire package of decisions on
factual and legal matters that have to be decided in the case
on its trial, and has to be, as in Heilce, with the so-called
right not to be. tried once transactional immunity had bean
granted, has to await the determination of the ferial and
all of its issues, so that piecemeal review will give way
to a consideration of that entire package upon appellate

,

review.
QUESTION; Of course Heike did not involve a. right
based on the Constitution, did it?
MR. THORNBURGH;

Well, I would submit that at that

time it might, well have been thought to encompass such a
right, because the statute was a substitute for the Fifth
Amendment right which prohibits -She use of testimony in an
incriminating sens©.

So I think that there is a — as the

Court noted in Hoik©

a distinct parallel to the trans-'

actional immunity argument and the double jeopardy argument.
Indeed, the Court in Heike noted, and more or less

.26

assumed that a claim of double jeopard;/ would be treated in
the same way. That is, that it would not have the effect of
interrupting the process but would have to await the
termination of the case itself»
Now, Heikef in a sense, I would submit, if it remains
good lew today, and we urge that, it does, really answers th©
questions that are raised in this case»
I think what has happened, that the development that
brings us to 'the consideration of the double jeopardy question
out of the circuits today, represents the false sense that
has been followed in a number of Circuit Courts, which have
led them, on the basis of Cohen, into a path of error.
I think, as 1 mentioned, first of all, they have
looked at the seductive argument of the uniqueness of double
jeopardy, drawing on cases like Ball and Green, which contain
descriptive language about the double jeopardy rights, which
are unassailable, but said not; in the context of th© appeal»
ability of a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss on
double jeopardy grounds.
This is an argument that was really fix’st raised in
the Fifth Circuit in Gilmore, where now Chief Judge Brown
noted that all appeal rights are statutory and not constitu­
tional, and then continued, in dealing with double jeopardy,
as follows, and I quotes
”There are many instances in which it is ultimately

27
determined that constitutional rights have been violated,,
but the nature of the asserted right, that is

to say, a

constitutional one, does not distinguish appeallafce review of
any such question from the assertion o£ other rights,
whether statutory or common law or from a procedural rule?
at least so long as a criminal case is pending, review of
such matters, as, for example, unlawful search and seizure,
unlawful arrest, unlawful detention, unlawful indictment,
unlawful confession, must await the trial and its outcome.”
The Fourth Circuit, in Lana down, disagreed, and
enunciated

a view of Cohen

which has found double jeopardy

claims to be collateral in the Cohen sense, and engender the
line of cases that brings us here today.
The premise on which these holdings of the Courts of
Appeals rely has not been examined in this Court since Heike,
and, needless to say, it has not occasioned any action by the
Congress to extend the scope of review of interlocutory
orders.
1 think when you examine the rationale in Lanedovrn,
in the Fourth Circuit, against the rationale expressed for
denying these, rights of interlocutory appeal in Cobbled!ck,
Justice Frankfurter's opinion of 1940, the deficiency in the
Courts of Appeals'

reasoning appears.

That is to say, in Lansdown the Court said;

Even

if :-m appellate court reverses the conviction in a second trial

2e

on the grounds of double jeopardy, a defendant has still net
been afforded the full protection of tie Fifth Amendment,
since he has been subjected to the embarrassment, expense,
anxiety, and insecurity involved in the second trial»
Compare this with Justice Frankfurter's language in
Cobbledick, where he said to the points

"Bearing the

discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by an
innocent persenis on© of the painful obligations of citizen”
ship»”
That is a painful doctrine, I will acknowledge.
But, as pointed out by Judge Brown, there are numerous cases
where an error can be made by the district court that will
occasion embarrassment, expense, anxiety and insecurity to a
defendant who later obtains a reversal of a conviction that
was obtained through error.
QUESTIONS

Well, is it a painful obligation of

citizenship, perhaps, to be tried once;; but the Constitution
makes verj clear teat it's not a painful obligation to be
tried a second time, after you have been convicted or
acquitted the first time.

That's the big difference between

what you read to us and the case now before us.
MR. THORNBURGH s

That is ~

QUESTION; That of being tried twice.

And that's

what the Constitution makes very clear is not a painful
obligation of citizenship,'the Constitution protects against

29

precisely that.
MR. THORNBURGHs

Indeed it doss, but the question

remains as to whether there is a statutory right to vindicate
that constitutional right before the trial has taken place.
There is no question-, and I : urge again that we
not fall into the error that I find myself sometimes in, of
thinking that we are talking about whether there exists a
right of double jeopardy.

What, I submit, w© are examining

is whether there is a statutory right.

Indeed, where there

was once no right to appeal in a criminal case, the question
becomes?

Do we have now a statutory ri.ght that encompasses

the vindication of a double jeopardy claim prior to trial?
QUESTIONs

Mr. Thornburgh, supposing that a motion

similar to the on© made in this case was made in the district
court, and the district judge, rather than denying it, simply
said, "I'm going to take it under advisement*
fairly debatable,"

I think it's

And kept it under advisement until the end

of the trial.
Do you suppose that the defendant would have had
any constitutional right to get a writ of mandamus from the
Third Circuit?
MR, THORNBURGH:

I think, in all probability, that

the judge weald have the power to do that.

It's frequently

do nr f in my experience, on matters that are raised pretrial
cr during tha trial.

And having the power to do so, I would

30

see no reason why the extraordinary writ would issue in the
face of the exercise of that power.
QUESTION: But are you saying there would be no
power to issue an extraordinary writ pursuant to Section 1291,
the all write Act?
MR. THORNBURGH:

Well, I think there certainly would

be Uie power to do so in the egregious case, but it would not
reach the question of the power of the district court to
defer consideration of such a motion until the end of the
trial.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thornburgh, assuming not-uncommon

18 month trials, that the double jeopardy claim is made, and
if it’s appealed,would it not only save the defendant, wouldn’t
it also save the government?
MR. THORNBURGH:

I suppose that such a prospect

could result, but I would submit that that’s something hat
the Congress could well take into consideration.
QUESTION:
the statute at all.

I didn’t ask a thing about Congress or
I asked you a question of fact.

If there

was a claarcut double jeopardy point that you and everybody
els© knew was there, wouldn’t it be better to get it; over with?
X think the answer is that if it was a good one, you
just wouldn’t proceed, you’d save your money.

But if it was

a questionable one, you’d make the defendant go out and pay
the money for his lawyer-; and everything els®.

31
MR. THORNBURGHs

Well, I think this Court so held

in Roche v. Evaporated Milk association, where that very
point was raised in an antitrust case.
QUESTIONS

Well, I think Evaporated Milk has got

more money than the average defendant.
MR. THORNBURGH:
Marshall.

I think that's right, Mr. Justice

I'm not going to argue about Evaporated Milk

against, the ordinary defendant or the defendant in this case,
but I submit that that kind of an argument, given the
statutory framework within which rights of appeal in criminal
cases exists, is one that must, of necessity, be decided in
the Congress by a balancing of an empirical assessment of
Evaporated Milk against the number of cases where appeal has
been taken on double jeopardy grounds that is
QUESTION: Well, what is the —
MR. THORNBURGH:
QUESTION:

— frivolous.

—> non -- you don't have any non»-legal

ground for supporting your argument, like saving money or
anything like that?
MR, THORNBURGH:

I have a groat many non-legal

grounds, I think, it's —
QUESTION: But you're not assorting them?
MR. THORNBURGH:
QUESTION;

I should not assert them?

I say, are you?

MR. THORNBURGH:

I will assert them, yes.

I think

32
that fcho problem here is one of judicial administration»
As Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted in the Cobb led! ck

case, the

theory of piecemeal review is not consonant with sound
judicial administration.

I don't want to be involved in

parading horribles before this Court on this Monday morning.
But one can easily see from the cases that have been decided
in the wake of these Circuit. Court decisions -that relate to the
appealability of double jeopardy cases, that we are going to
be faced with claims, at least, that will rise to the Circuit
Courts and eat up the time that they have available to
consider appellate matters, in areas such as the speedy trial
provisions of the Constitution.
MacDonald has done that.
QUESTION:

In Alessi ■—

Mr. Thornburgh, couldn't we take car© of

all those by writing a narrow ©pinion, making it clear we're
not deciding that?
If the theory of this is that there is a right not
to b© tried, expressed in the Fifth Amendment, why wouldn't
that provide an answer to that particular risk?
MR. THORNBURGHS

Well, I would obviously urge that

this Court not open this Pandora's Box, because I can see —*
QUESTION;

What is your reason — what, is your basic

explanation of why the Cohen case does not. apply?
MR. THORNBURGHt

I think the real difference between

this and Cohan is that Cohen involved, an did the bail case,

33

a kind of a turnstile phenomenon»

That is, 'the costs of 'the

case, the amount of bail,, are clearly separable from the type
of —
QUESTIONS Well, is it your theory that the case can
go on without deciding that issue, it doesn't interrupt the
proceeding?

That's what you seem to aay in your brief»

MR» THORNBURGHS Well, it —
QUESTIONS Which would fe© true in the bail situation,
but I don't think it would really be true in the Cohen
situation»
Wasn’t the theory of that that requiring this
security for costs would have actually terminated the litiga­
tion if the district court order had stood?
MR» THORNBURGH*

Wall, -that was looking at it as at

practical matter*
QUESTION s

Yea„

MR. THORNBURGH* That may well foe 30.
QUESTIONS

And isn't that the same situation here,

thafcif you allow th© order to stand, the defendant loses his
right not to b@ tried a second time?
Why are they differant?

I am just a little puzzled»

MR» THORNBURGHs Well, I think that again I get back
to the point of the easy equivalency, of the existence of the
double jacpartly right in the Constitution, and the right to
pre-trial appeal*

There are, again I submit, on the basis of

34

Judge Brown’s litany of cases that might, occasion equally
serious constitutional deprivations —
QUESTIONs But you have already agreed that none of
those involves a deprivation caused by the trial itselfj it
is the trial which involves the violation of the man’s
cons ti tu ti o na 1 r.1 gh fcs,
MR* THORNBURGHj

I would urge that if we are to look

at the practical aspects of the case in Cohen, that we should
also look at the practical aspects of the case in a
criminal case*

That is to say, the double jeopardy right

might pale in comparison with a supposed egregious error
on the question of admissibility of evidence, of constitution"*
ality, of a particular statute under which the individual is
charged, whether he had been given proper warnings, whether
he had bean tortured or a confession had been extracted from
him*
I think if we look at the practical side, a la your
suggestion in Cohen, that there are aiy number of problems which
would rise to the level of the double jeopardy claim.
And again, reverting to the basic framework within
which appellat® rights exist, it still does not deal with the
question of whether or not the Congress has seen fit to
provide, in this type of case, knowledgeable of the develop­
ments in Cobbledick,

DiBella, Heike, and the like, any kind

of pretrial for the denial of double jeopardy, of the type

35
involved in this case,
X*d like to deal briefly —
QUESTION;

Could I just ask one other question?

Assume a State system provides fox- appeal in this sort of
situation, without the complication of extraordinary risk that
you had in one of those State cases, just say it was a direct
appeal to the State system, and the Stats Suprema Court
rejected the claim. Would that be a final decision under
for purposes of —
MR. THORNBURGH;

It has been so held. Ancl I think

that’s the second thread that has led the Circuit Courts in
these cases into —
QUESTION; Do you think there’s a greater —■ that the
requirement of finality imposes a stricter standard on the
federal review than it does on the review of State court
decisions?
MR. THORNBURGHS
apples and oranges»

Well, they are, if I may say,

The State determination of the federal

issue is final because it’s the only federal issue.

■

Whereas

in the eases that come out of the federal courts, there is
a vast catalog of federal issues that could be presented
seriatim —
QUESTION;

Do you suggest the State decision would

not be final within that docket cf cases if there lurked the
possibility cf a search and seizure issue in the case?

Or a

36

Fifth Amendment;* or some other federal constitutional issue
relating to the merits?
MR» THORNBURGH?

Well* having run its course and

reached «*«
QUESTION;

No* we are still pretrial* and we just

know that there are often federal issues in State criminal
trials.

And you're saying the existence of those would deprive

the order of finality* or are you saying they don’t make any
difference?
MR, THORNBURGH;

Well* I think* again* what we get,

hack to is the difference between the two systems* that if the,
State has countenanced a threshold arrival of this issue* this
federal issue at its highest, court level* that this Court is
entitled to determine that that is final for Stata purposes
and therefore appropriate under 1257 for appeal in this»
Court.
But the spectre which you —
QUESTION; Wall* just to b© sura I have your answer*
you do not rely «n the fact that there’s only one federal
issue in the State proceeding; that’s not your rationale?
It’s rather that the State is willing to allow an appeal * so
we might as well do the same thing?
MR. THORNBURGH s

I think that the former issue has

been present in every case that this Court has decided on that

37

QUESTIONS

Well, then, I’m asking yon:

Is that

critical to those decisions, in your view?
I think it was in Judge Friendly's view,
MR, THORNBURGH;

I was going to say that, but I am

not ©quipped —
QUESTIONs

It doesn’t make much sense, does it, to

say that because — that it would be appealable, if there
can be shown there is no potential additional federal issue
in the case?

That's kind of a —

MR, THORNBURGH;

One could conceive of a State

equivalent of 2255 or other types of tilings that might raise
constitutional issues, to be sure.

But in toe course of that

particular litigation, litigative track, it is final, and
— for State purposes -« and right for appeal, I would
analyze, under 1257 as

distinguished, from what, we're dealing

with under 129.1,
.And I -think those Stat® casee are -» really are —QUESTIONs

Well, the language of the federal

statute is a little more favorable fox: appeal, because it
talks about final decisions, and toe other statute talks
about final judgments, doesn’t it?
MR, THORNBURGH;

Yes,

I must say I don't, know how

to assess that. There is, I realize, a treatment of that
/

difference in decisions of this Court, but I can’t divine
any difference that would produce a more favorable treatment,

38

or one way or another»
I would urge that the language b© treated as its
equivalent.
QUESTION;

Mr. Thornburgh, in your parade of

anticipated horribles, i,f you lose on the double jeopardy
issue f would you also include an issue having to do with the
speech and debate clause?
MR. THORNBURGHS
by Judge Friendly.

That, was tii® reference suggested

I don’t; know, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I

don’t know.
QUESTION:

I suppose yon do concede that the lynch»’

pin of this case is the nature of double jeopardy?
MR. THORNBURGHS

I think that what th© Courts of

Appeals have found to b© the lynchpin for deviating from the
finality rule in criminal cases has been the nature of
double jeopardy. But I -*» 1 don’t see

I urge on this

Court that it is not a distinguishable, factor from a broad
variety of other serious constitutional problems, which might
be just ae apt candidates for pretrial review if one is to
indulge one's self in permitting that kind of review.
QUESTION; Would you take the same position, General
Thornburg! , if the double jeopardy issue was that — not that
he was being subjected bo another trial, but that he was being
subjected to a second conviction for the same crime?
MR. THORNBURGH;

X think that it’s a distinction

39

without a difference, in rry view.
QUES TION;

Really?

MR. THORNBURGH!;

Well, —

QUESTION2 Because, after all, the double jeopardy
clause is — it does talk about double jeopardy, but it
certainly aims, it also aims at preventing

double convxctlons

or double punishments for the same crime, does it not?
MR© THORNBURGH; Well, that could only be determined
after the second conviction had been obtained, and that was
what I —
QUESTION;

That's what X said©

MR© THORNBURGH;

I’m sorry©

QUESTION; Would you take the same
MR. THORNBURGH:

No, certainly, then it is

appropriate! for review, because the process has played itself
out and you haven't —QUESTION; Well, I understand that. But, before the
trial, before the second trial, the claim is, the defendant
says 551 don’t mind — I’m not objecting to having go through
trial? I object to the fact, that I am threatened with another
conviction for what I claim is the «ame crime as I was
convicted last week for.”
MR. THORNBURGH;

That I must .revert to seeing a

distinction without a difference, because the claim is
anticipatory : otii the trial plays itself out.

He may be

40
acquitted.

The trial may abort for some other reason.
I don't think that that is a particularly

persuasive addition to the argument with respect to exposure
to trial.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Thornburgh, if the question of

appealability should go against it — you have only a minute
or two, I notice — are you going to say anything about the
\

merits?
MR. THORNBURGH:

I would like to take my remaining

time to address the merits briefly.
The case as presented by the Petitioner states that
because of toe duplicity of the indictment it is difficult,
if not impossible, to determine what tit® verdict 'was in the
first trial.
I think a search of the record, particularly the
charge of the court in this case., with its final words to the
jury being emphasized, makes it clear that what the government
was doing her© was not overreaching, as: the Petitioner
alleges , but underreaching.

They wort setting «* tort muth

greater for themselves, which I would certainly not want to
do, of securing convictions on both of -diesa offenses. The
trial judge defined the statute in terms of conspiracy or
attempt, and then proceeded to charge on the necessity of
convicting for conspiracy sad attempt, even going to the
length in his iart words to the jury of pointing out that both

41
of those offenses had to be — result; in conviction»
I don't think that we can ass-ma that the jury did
not fallow those instructions»

The colloquy which is relied

upon by counsel for the Petitioner was not communicated to
the jury# and I think what we must do is to look at those
instructions that were given to the jury, and they clearly
indicate that they were under a charge to convict of both
offenses, conspiracy and attempt»
And in that event, it strikes me that we need
proceed no further»
With respect to the statement of an offense, the
so-called pendent claim, if on® refers to the brief and our
analysis of the Hobbs Act charge, it seems clear that the

Act

what is charged is that the acts amounting to attempted

extortion were performed in furtherance of a properly
alleged conspiracy»

And that there was no failure to charge

in the terms of the Hobbs Act»
So that I think that when we do get to the merits,
after this trial regarding the appealability pretrial, that
we find, indeed, that if this is the type of claim that is
going to inject itself into our appellate process willy-nilly
on a piecemeal basis, we will suffer considerable delay and
misuse of appellate time»
Thank you»
QUESTIONS I take it your position is, though, that

42
even if the double jeopardy issue is appealable, the others
aren* t?
MR* THORNBURGH s

Absolutely not*

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

Mr* Samuel, you have about five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH DAVID SAMUEL, ESQ.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAMUELs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court?
Turning first to the last comments of th© Attorney
General?
The indictment here is reproduced at page 9 of the
Appendix, and it only takes up a. short — excuse me, I may
ha.va — page 5 of the Appendix.
more than a page.

It only takes tip a little bit

And it really is very instructive to read

that indictment, because that indictment does not charge,
properly charge a conspiracy, it does not. charge any agreement?
it charger a conspiracy and attempt by attempt.

There is

no language in there to suggest in any way that -these
defendants agreed to commit an attempt.

The charge is -they

attempted, it doesn’t say that they attempted together,
that they agreed to attempt, that they conspired in any way,
except the. single, bar© word "conspiracy*.
For that reason, we believe that th© indictment
fails to state an of fens©, because now, with th© attempt

43
portion of the charge deleted, it charges a conspiracy to
commit attempted extortion, which we have noted is not a crime
under the Hobbs Act.
The charge of the court cannot, we submit, correct
the deficiencies of the duplicitous indictment.
at page

The charge,

22 of the Appendix, talks about the charge against

each Individual defendant.
Now, her® w® have two separate charges, the court
lumps them together as the charge.
He then goes on, on page 26 cf the Appendix, "the
offense charge”, lumps them together again.

And so forth,

throughout the remaining part of the charge of the court.
Now, the position of the Petitioners is that where
there are two separate charges, where there is a duplicitous
indictment, to lump them together as one creates sewn®tiling
which is incognizable by the jury. The jury is considering
something which is completely separate from the two crimes
charged.

They ere asked to consider something which is not

within the province of the criminal law.
Turning back to the appealability question, I 'think
it,’a important to not® that the Petitioners here are not
trying to gat into the Third Circuit, they are not testing
thei;: right to appeal.

They were there. The question is,

did chc Third Circuit hay© appropriate end proper federal
juried: ction to consider their claim?

And that* I think* is an important question*
In reaching that question* the question of finality
becomes very important* whether or not it is a final decision*
And in Stack vs. Boyle* a very similar situation to
this* where bail was considered to be a final decision* and
re view able pretrial. And whether or not; the trial

-went on

before the appellate court reached that, made no difference.
The fact is that the appellants in Stack vs. Boy.I® had n right
to have the appellate court reach the question of whether the
bail was excessive.
In Harris vs. Washington, here I -chink Harris is a
very important case here* albeit it did arise in the State
courts j but it was a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy
grounds in the trial court* which was denied.

A writ of

prohibition was entered by the Court of Appeals* and reversed
by the State Supreme Court.
one issues

So this Court had before it only

whether or not the denial of a motion to dismiss

on double jeopardy grounds was a final judgment* in the words
of that statute* for purposes of review?
And* as w© have pointed out and the government agrees
the criteria for final judgment, final decision* are the same
and have been held to be the same.
QUESTION s

Wouldn't it soma tines be true —- at least

sometimes — Mr. Samuel* that whether or not the bar against
double jeopardy was applicable would not clearly appear until

45

at least the start of th© second prosecution?

I'm thinking of

an Ash© v. Swenson kind of a case,

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
