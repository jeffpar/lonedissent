MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We311 hear arguments next

in National Labor Relations Board against Enterprise-.
Mr. Come* I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J„ COME* ESQ..
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas® the

Court:
This eas® is here on certiorari to fch© District of
Columbia Circuit which, sitting @n banc and dividing five to
four»- denied enforcement of the Board’s order against respondent
union.

*
The question presented is whether a union engages in

an unlawful secondary boycott within the meaning of Section
8(b)(4) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act when it causes
employees of a firm with which the union has a collective
bargaining agreement containing a work preservation clause to
[sic]

handle prefabricated goods that their employer's contract with
a general contractor obliges the employer to install.
This was a question which was noted but not decided
in National Woodwork* a 1967 decision of this Court.
The facts are briefly these:
Austin* the engineer and
construction of a Home for the Aged

general contractor for
in Brooklyn* specified the

use of climate control units manufactured by Slant/Fin Corpora--

4
tion.

Under these specifications, Slant/Pin was to cut, thread,

and install at the factory the internal piping on these units,
which carried a one-y^ar warranty contingent upon factory
fabrication of 'the internal piping.
As a result of competitive bidding, Austin, awarded
a subcontract for the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
work on the Home to Hudik,

This work included, as Hudik was

aware, installation of the Slant/Fin units.
How, Hudik, the subcontractor, had a collective
bargaining agreement with the respondent union, a Local of the
Plumbers and Steamfittars Union,
Rule IX of this agreement provided, among other things,
that radiator branches, convector branches and coil connections
shall be cut and threaded by hand on the job.
Shortly after th® Slant/Fin units, which had been
purchased by Austin, arrived on the jobsite, the union business
agent went to Austin, the general contractor, and informed him,
his project superintendent, that the union members would not
install the Slant/Fin units because the piping inside the units
was steamfittars work, and the business agent then went to
Hudik and told him essentially th© same thing, adding that the
prefabrication of th© internal piping in th® units was in
violation of Rui® IX of the collective agreement.
As a result, Hudik5s employees
th© Slant/Fin unit®,

refused to install

Whereupon Austin filed an unfair labor

5
practice charge with the Board,,

The Board concluded that the

union’s refusal to install the Slant/Fin units was a secondary
boycott in violation of Section 8(b) (4) (B), because the Board
found that;

While the refusal of Hudik's employees to install

these units was based on a valid work preservation clause in
the agreement with Hudik, and was for the purpose of preserving
work they had traditionally performed, Hudik was incapable of
assigning of this work to his employees, and therefore the union,
in exerting strike pressure on Hudik, had coupled its work
preservation objective with an unlawful secondary objective of
also trying to change Austin's manner of doing business with
Slant/Fin,
The Board entered an appropriate remedial order0
And the Court of Appeals, as I have indicated, denied enforce­
ment of the Board's order0

The majority of the Court finding

that the Board's reliance upon Hudik's lack of power to assign
the work was inconsistent with the principles enunciated by
this Court in National Woodwork0
Now, I'd like to turn to National Woodwork,
Section 8(b)(4)(B) makes it an unfair labor practice
for

&

labor organisation or its agents to ©xert strike, pressure

against an employer for an object of forcing any person to
cease using, handling, or otherwise dealing in the products of
any other person, or to cease doing business with any other
person

6
A proviso states that this provision shall not be
construed to makes unlawful any primary strike or primary
picketing.
Now, as this Court recognised shortly after the *47
amendments which added the secondary boycott provision to the
Act that Section 8(b) (4) (B) must be interpreted

so as to

foster the dual congressional objectives of preserving the
right of labor organizations to bring pressure on offending
employers in primary labor disputes , and of shielding
unoffending employers and others from controversies — from
pressures and controversies not their own.
Now, ‘the task of achieving this accommodation is a
very* very difficult one.

For the distinction between

legitimate primary and illegal secondary activity, as this
Court has indicated, is rarely a glaringly bright line.
Union activity is secondary, if an object of the
activity is to force the cessation of or change in business
relations between two entities,
On the other hand, the objectives of even primary
activity includes a desire to influence others to withhold
their patronage from the employer against whom the pressure is
exerted.
And some union activity, which I submit is this case,
will have both a primary object and.a secondary object,

And

in that event, the activity is unlawful for Section 8(b)(4)

7
proscribes activity if an object is secondary*
Nowt let me illustrate the way these principles were
applied in National Woodwork ,f and try to point out the
difference that the Board sees between the situation here and
that which was before the Court in National Woodwork.
The issue in National Woodwork was whether a union
had engaged in an unlawful secondary boycott by refusing to
permit its members, who were employed by Frouge, a general
contractor, to install prefabricated doors*

Finishing doors

was work that Frouge’s employees had traditionally performed
on the jobsite»

And the collective agreement had a work

preservation clause similar to the one her©, which provided that
Frouge’s employees would not be required to handle doors that
had been finished off the jobsite.
The employees struck when Frouge nevertheless ordered
the pre~finished doors, although he was not required to do so,
by his contract with the project owner»
The Court stated that the determination whether the
union’s activity was primary or secondary turned on whether,
to quote from the Court, Mund@r all the surrounding circumstances
the union's object was preservation of work for Frouge”s employees
or whether the agreement and the boycott were tactically
calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere,3
QUESTION%
MR» COKEs

Mr. Come, —
Yes, sir?

8

QUESTION: Assume there had been no provision in the
contract and that to strike otherwise wouldn't have violated
the contract? the result would have been the same?
MR» COME:

That is correct? Your Honor? and I think

that the contract does not make the difference? the question is
whether the activity that it was engaged in is secondary or
primary*
Now? applying the test that I outlined to the facte
in National Woodwork? the Court found that the contract clause
was a valid work preservation clause? therefore no violation
of 3{@)? and that the facts established that the union's
object in invoking the clause against Prouge was solely a
preservation of the traditional task of jobsite carpenters,
Frouge had the option of prescribing pr@~finished
doors or not prescribing it*

He had elected to order them?

and that got him into his problem with the union*
Now? the facts here? we submit? differ from the
situation in National Woodwork? and I might say at the same
time that the Board decided National Woodwork ? in that very
case you had three subcontractors who were in precisely tee
same situation teat Hudik was in here? the Board had found an
8(b)(4) violation as to them? tee Court of Appeals had
sustained that finding? but the union did not bring that before
the court? and it was for that reason that that issue was not
before th© Court in National Woodwork*

s
QUESTION:

Well, actually, that's 'the reason it was

expressly reserved, wasn't it?
MR. COME:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor,,
But this Court's decision in National

Woodwork upheld the determination of the Board, didn’t it?
MR. COME:

It upheld the determination of the Board

as to Frouge, who had the power to control whether or not his
employees were to be deprived of the work of finishing the
doors.
In contrast to Frouga, who was free to decide whether
or not to use. prefabricated doors, Hudik was obligated by his
contract with Austin to install the prefabricated climate
control units; by demanding that Hudik5s employees perform
on the jobsite the internal piping work on these climate
control units, the union was seeking work that Hudik never
possessed and did not have a right to obtain.

Confronted by

the union’s demand for the work, Hudik, as a practical matter,
had available only two. courses of actions
It could have induced, tried to induce Austin to
change his specifications for tire job, or, failing that, to
terminate its contract with Austin.
The second course, like a refusal to bid on the job
initially, would not have preserved or produced work for
Hudik's employees, indeed it would have lost for them the rest
of the piping work that they had on this job.

10
The first course? inducing —
QUESTION3 Welly I suppose? Mr, Corae, that there was
mother alternative!:

it could perhaps negotiate with its

employees and pay them a bonus to install in the doors,
MR, COME;

The Court of Appeals mentions that

alternative? Your Honor? and on this record there was no
suggestion that that was ever contemplated by the union.

On

this record? the demand was solely for the work.
Now? the first course? namely inducing Austin to
change its specification? would have produced this work only
if Austin were willing to do that. So that in these circum­
stances you find that whereas the union? to be sure? may have
been motivated by a work preservation object? it could not
have obtained -that object without changing the decision of
Austin and possibly also Slant/Pin.
Whereas in the Frouge case? Frouge could have granted
the union’s demand by merely changing its own decision? dis­
continuing

ordering the pre-finished doors.

Now? granted that the line between whether a
cessation of business is an object or whether it’s just an
incidental — it’s an incident, of lawful primary activity?
granted that that line is a fine one? and it is difficult in
some cases to find out which side of the line it falls on? we
submit that it was at least within the Board’s province to
conclude? and it was reasonable in so concluding? that given a

11
situation such as you have heret where in order to obtain the
union’s work preservation objective the employer pressure,,
even though he was the employer of the employees involveds
would only giva them what they sought by changing the decisions
of -third parties „ that involves too much of a impairment of
ta rights of third parties to be regarded as purely incidental
to legitimate primary activity? and, for that reasone that the
Board was warranted in concluding that the union's pressure
here* at least an object* concluded an unlawful secondary one
QUESTION:
MR, COME;

Mr* Come, -— proscribed by 8(b)(4)(B)e

Yes* Your

Honor?
QUESTION;

Weren't they violating the work preserva­

tion clause?
MR, COME;

The Board did not have an 8(e) charge

attacking the validity of the work preservation clause„

It

assumed that the work preservation clause was lawful because
on its face it was susceptible of being applied in a lawful
situation.
And* as I indicated in my answer to Justice White's
conclusion* it was not crucial to the Board's decision to
determine whether the clause was lawful or unlawful* because
whether the clause is lawful or unlawful* you cannot use
secondary pressure to implement it,
QUESTION; Well* what could the union do to protect

12
its own contract?
MR, COME:

Well, 1 think that* first of all* you have

the question as to whether or not a contract was meant to be
applied to a situation where Hudik had no control over the work»
QUESTIONs

Would it have an action for breach of

contract against, the employer, entirely independent of this?
HR. COME;

I submit that it could have.

X want to

deal with two situations.
In the first place, if the contract was not intended
— granted that it covers finishing piping work on the jobsite
— if it was not intended, however, to apply to a situation
where the sub didn't have control over the work, obviously it
wouldn’t

an action wouldn't lie if one were brought, but it

could b© brought.
On the other hand, if it — and whether — and you
determine the legality of the contract from the circumstances
under which it was entered into, because 8{e) makes it a
violation to enter into an illegal agreement.

And the mere

fact that the union may unilaterally later seek to apply it to a
secondary situation doesn't necessarily make the contract
unlawful.
So you have the initial question as to whether the
contract was intended to cover a situation where Hudik lacked
control.
Assuming that it did, then you get into the question

13
as to whether or not the contract would be, nonetheless, saved
from illegality by the construction industry proviso to 8{e),
which privileges certain subcontracting agreements for work to
be done at the jobsite in the building construction industry,
even though those contracts in other industries may violate
Section 8{e).
But even those contracts , a legislative history makes
clear, cannot be enforced by restraint and coercion that would
violate 8(b) (4) , a lawsuit is -the only way that yon could
enforce the contracto
So if I can sum up, after giving, I think, too long
an answer to your question, Justice Marshall, if in fact it is
to be d@fee:mined that this contract was intended to encompass
a situation where Hudik lacked control over the work, Hudik -the union may be ahl© to get damages in a lawsuit, but it
could not resort to economic pressure that would violat®
8(b)(4).
But ‘that is not a question that we’re putting forth.
QUESTION*

Well, couldn’t Hudik have protected

himself in the negotiation of the contract by adding a provis ion in there to limit the preservation?
MR. CQMEs Well, whether it had negotiated a contract,
that would have provided for the payment of damages or the
wages that would fos lost by —
QUESTION?

No, I mean couldn't he have changed the

14
preservation clause and had it written so that 'there would hm
provisos in there?
MR. COMB:

Which would cover this situation.,
Welly

even if they did,. Your Honor* I

submit that they could not use pressure that would violate
Section 8(b) (4) (B) .

They might only b© able to —

QUESTION: Well* l®m not talking about — I’m talking
about the employer could have protected himself by putting a
proviso in the preservation clause which said ^except where”
w@ get just like we got now.

He could have put that in the

contract?
MR. COME:

I?e could have put that in th© contract* --

QUESTION: But he didn't,
MR. COME:

««• but I submit* Your Honor* that

Congress*

nonetheless* has intended to free him from economic pressure
to enforce that commitment* on the same theory that this Court
recognised in the Sand Door case* that under the * 47 amendments
the entry into hot cargo clauses was not illegal!sed* but*
nonetheless* th® Court sustained the Board’s finding that
while Congress permitted a voluntary entry into these agreements
and permitted their enforcement through lawsuits* it drew the
line at using economic pressure to enforce them,
QUESTION:

In fcha Board’s view in this case* could

the union legitimately have applied economic pressure to Austin?
MR, COKE:
Your Honor

Th© Board has not answered that question*

15
QUESTION: Why?
MR* COME:

They concluded that since the only person

•pressured here was Hudik# that question was not before them.
QUESTION:

It seems to ms it's important to know#

in order to properly decide this case# assuming that you have a
legitimate work preservation provision in the collective
bargaining agreement# which I believe is the premise and the
assumption on which we ara proceeding in this case# and since
the Woodworking case held that economic pressure could b©
exerted to enforce such an agreement# it’s important# as far as
I’m concerned# to know what the Board’s position is as to
whether or not the union is free to exert economic pressure
against Austin,
Because# if not# then it*3 not free to exert economic
pressure against anybody to enforce and effectuate the work
preservation agreement 'that Woodworking holds can be enforced
by economic pressure,
MR. COME:

Well# the only thing that Woodworking

held# Your Honor# as I read it# is that you can exert economic
pressure to enforce a work preservation clause in a situation
where the employer has control over the work.
QUESTION:

Do you -think Austin in -this eas© would

have been with or without power t© accede?
MR, COMB:

I think that Austin would h&v® bean with

power# in the sense that h© was fr@@ to have prescribed other

QUESTION:
Hudik, isn't it?

Only by renegotiation of his contract with

He would have no more, no less power than

you tell us Hudik had.

of a contract, wouldn't it?

MR. COME;

I must, in view of the footnote in the

Board's opinion, which is alluded to in our brief, in which the

QUESTION:
MR. COME;

■

"In view of bur finding
■

'that Respondent’s actions were undertaken for a secondary
object, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the Administrative
Law Judge's finding that Austin and Slant/Pin were primary
employers.

Hence, we are not deciding herein whether picketing

or other actions brought to bear directly against Austin and
Slant/Fin would constitute lawful primary activity.”
QUESTION:

I'm suggesting only that it seems to me,

17
in light of Woodworking# which certainly stands for the proposi­
tion that a work preservation clause such as this# assuming it's
a legitimate one# and that is the assumption here# can be
enforced by a union by the application of economic sanctione
It's important# I would say# that in this case to know whether
that could be enforced against, anybody# by economic sanction,,
Or whether# in a case like this where there's a subcontract# that
Woodworking becomes a dead letter»
MRo COME;

I only repeat myself when I say that I do

not read Woodworkers as deciding that -there's a right to bring
economic pressure to enforce a work preservation clause in a
situation such as we have here»
I've also referred in my brief to two decisions that
cast some light on this problem# but do not directly answer it»
There is the case of Wes tern Monolifchics # in which the Board
held# prior to a decision in this case# that pressure against
the general contractor would ba permissible in this type of a
situation# and that decision was denied enforcement by the
Ninth Circuit.
And# subsequent to this decision# there was a case
called Summit# in which the Board found that in the circumstances
there picketing of the manufacturer was not permissible? but in
that situation the manufacturer’s employees were represented by
another union# and the pressura against him involved a violation
of 8(b) {4) (D) # in that they were seeking to enforce the

18
reassignment of work from the manufacturer's employees to the
union employees.
I think'the answer to that question may well depend
upon what it is that the union is seeking,,

If it is seeking to

appeal to consumers not to purchase Slant/Fin products because
that diminishes their work opportunities, the answer -QUESTION:

It's seeking to effectuate its work

preservation clause, that it is negotiating, through collectives
bargaining, has succeeded in getting into the collective
bargaining agreement.

And Woodworkers said that it was proper

and legitimate objective.

And if

the answer to my question

would let us know whether, in the context of -this case, we5re
saying that it cannot enforce — effectuate that against
anybody, or simply that it cannot effectuate it. against Hudik,
but could against Austin.

And I think that's of some importance.

MR. COME:

I wish I had a better answer for you.

QUESTION:

Well, the Board just doesn't take a

position, and I understand that.
MR. COME: Right.
QUESTION: Are you suggesting that Austin have any
more or less control than Hudik?
MR. COME:

I think that at the -time that the specifica”

tions were drawn up, yes, he may

Had the economic pressure been applied

MR. COME;
QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Com©, if, when the pressure

was applied here, the principal contractor had said, "Oh, wall,
go ahead and use what" — called him up on the phone and said,
KI understand you're having trouble with the labor, just go
ahead and use whatever doors you want."

This case would have

It would have been like the situation of

Hr. Gold.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOLDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it pleas© the

Courts
In National Woodwork',. ■ ■

as Mr. Come said, this Court

canvassed at least the beginning of this problem, and we would
emphasize that it did not reach this issue, not because it was
forecasting a difference, but because, as it was explicitly
stated in to® opinion, toe union didn't take a cross-appeal
from — didn't file a cross-petition from the portion of the
case in which it did not prevail, and therefor© the Court said
that this further issue was not before them.
However, we don't believe that National Woodwork is
immaterial here.

The Court did not simply decide a case on its

facts as five Court of Appeals recognized thereafter, it stated
a method of decision, a method of decision for determining who
is a — what is a primary dispute is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Come has quoted to® operative language.

And it's whether,

under all the surrounding circumstances, the union's objective
was preservation of work for the employees, and this is my

21
addition, of the employer who signed the agreement and who is
being struck, and not going back to the quote, fSor whether
the agreements in boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy
union objectives elsewhere,”
The touchstone is whether the agreement or its
maintenance is addressed to -the labor relations of the contracting
employer, vis-a-vis his own employees.
That was not a test which was new, but, as the opinion
demonstrates, goes all the way back to the basic understanding
beginning with Puplex vs„ Pearlng, which is a vary long time
ago.
And during all the intervening time, there's been an
understanding that there is a difference between primary
activity and the secondary boycott, and that the essence of
primary activity and a primary strike is that it's a strike by
employees against their own employer, in defense of their own
working conditions.
We quote *—

QUESTION;

Well, you, I suppose — is it your

position then that even if this particular subcontractor had
always used prefabricated door3, then the union was simply
striking to try to get their own employer to quit using pre­
fabricated doors and had th@m constructed by them at. the jobsite, you would be making the same argument?

MR. GOLD:

Mr. Justice White, in National Woodwork,

22
the Court, left open the question, another question left open,
as to whether primary activity
QUESTION:

I was asking you about what your position

was on ito
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

— whether primary activity is only

the defense of traditional work, or if it includes the attempt
to secure additional work.
Our position would be that the essence of the primarysecondary. dichotomy is that there is no such distinction.
QUESTION:

So your answer to my question is y©s?

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

But isn't determinative her®, is what I was trying to
say, because here there is a square finding that this is
traditional unit work, that this is not an acquired taste, and
it may be that the line is drawn somewhere, and that we are
correct here and incorrect in our further assertion, I recognise
that,

And I recognize that we have no authority supporting the

position I was arguing before.
QUESTION:

Your assertion would be even in the

absence of any work preservation clause at all?

That the result

should come out your way in this case?
MR. GOLD:

Well, that's right.

Our view is that at a

certain point of time the employer and his employees meet to
negotiate a collective agreement.
agreement by hypothesis

At that point there is no

23

If the union seeks a secondary agreement, the -«* it’s ■
violating 8(b)(4)(A) and 8(e), that*a the change of the law —
QUESTION:
MR» GOLD:

The Sand Door proposition»
Right.

Effected in 1959.

, So it can only seek a lawful agreement in the first:
place, and therefore the — the agreement doesn’t change any­
thing here, it's simply evidence that that was what the — that
the union was seeking to preserve its traditional work.

And

it18 also relevant secondarily, I would say, because it
demonstrates what is, to us, a very strange set of priorities
and equities, as the Board views the matter.
It so happens that hare the contract was first the
collective agreement.

At that point, the Board, as w© read its

opinion, expressly recognises that the union could negotiate a
contract, and then the Board says that the employer subsequently
can go and negotiata a contract with another employer, turn
himself from a primary into a neutral, and neutralize the
union’s ability to enforce the agreement by its normal method
of a strike against the employer with whom it had the lawful
agreement.
Now, the Board suggests in its Reply Brief, in Point
I of the Reply Brief, that we overstate the proposition — we
overstate the test of what is primary activity, because there
can be some situations in which the employees' own conditions
are matters which they cannot validly strike over.

And -they

24

give tiie example:

Suppose the employees wish to have a clause

in -the agreement saying that they don't have to work on a job
where other employers employ non-union men? or suppose 'that
they ask to negotiate an agreement saying that they do not have
to handle goods coming from a struck plant.
But we haven't used the term "working conditions" in
a limitless sense.

In one view of the worid, a world w© would

far prefer,, working conditions could be anything that affect
employees.
But w® recognise that in -those two situations which
are the situations of the Denver Building case, and of the
issue covered by 8(e) , Congress has decided that while you could
reformulate the matter to say that the immediate employees who
don't want to work on the same jobsite with non-union people
are having their working conditions affected? it's only in the
most remote way, and that the real problem is the problem
between another employer, namely, whether he's going to recognize
the union, and his own employees.

And there3s only a derivative

effect.
Her© the question of whether there's going to be a
work preservation agreement, and whether these pipefitters and
steam fitters are going to do the work they've don© for years,
is of immediate and direct concern to them.

If they work fewer

hours, if -they have less work, fewer of them work, obviously?
their wage rates, however high they may be, are multiplied by

25
fewer hours? they are. directly and immediately threatened in
the most basic way.
And we think that the distinction between the case
here# where the whole pattern of the Act sanctions the union’s
concern and denominates -the working conditions# these employees’
own working conditions# and the situation where the employees
are really interested in the working conditions and the
employment relationship between other employers is plain.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold# is there anything in this record

that throws any light on the question of whether Hudik, as a
construction industry subcontractor here# had a regular
permanent cadre of workers, or whether h® might have just
gotten workers by the job from the construction hall# from the
hiring hall?
MR. GOLD:

I don’t believe that there is anything in

the record in -this case.

Hudik was dealing with the union on

behalf of the people he normally employed.
QUESTION:

But if h© just got people from a hiring

hall on a job basis# you could say that there certainly would
appear to be something to the Board's contention that -these
people never would have had a job at all# if he hadn’t bid on
this contract.
MR. GOLD:

Well# but these are the kinds of calcula-»

felons that both employers and unions and their members have to

male© all the time.

26

The union is saying:

Our long-run interest is

preserving this traditional work*
The employer’s reply argument is that:

I will not

be able to bid and secure as much work as I otherwise would*
And the union says that: We are prepared for that
test*

That’s our calculation, and that’s our gamble*
That’s no different from the union sayings

to work for eight dollars an hour.

We want

And the employer sayings

Most of the bids come out in a way which means that if my labor
costs are over seven»fifty, I canot secure the work*
The union says: We think the labor — there’s more
elasticity in the bid market than you say; we think that we
can organize enough of the workers in this area so that we can
maintain our labor conditions, and we insist on the conditions
w@ ask.
The whole theory of the Act is that a matter like that,
is to b® worked out between the employer and his employees and
their representative through bargaining,
it’s wrong.

If the union is wrong,

But -that doesn’t mean it isn’t seeking to preserve

its traditional standards, or, in the wage case I gave, to get
the wages that the employees believe are worthwhile for their
work,
And to denominate that as turning from primary to
secondary, if the employer accepts a bid for seven-fifty and
then says;

I no longer can pay you eight dollars.

Which is

27
really the Board's theory.

Because. I no longer have control .

over the matter.
That seems to us to be a perversion of the whole
theory of the Act.
The Board’s position, as Mr. Come has indicated, is
that an employer who cannot give the employees immediate
satisfaction without changing an agreement he has subsequently
reached with someone else, is a neutral, seems to us to be
defective on many, many scores.
Let me begin with one which has already been explored,
and that isj

once the 'two employers have reached their agree-»

mant, who is th© primary?
And there are two possible answers.
Th© Board first ventured the answer in the Western
Monolith!cs case, which Mr. Come mentioned, which is a Ninth
Circuit case, which eventually became a Ninth Circuit case,
that the general contractor becomes th© primary because he has
th© right of control.
v
Th© Ninth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Eugene
Wright, said no, you can’t say -chat the general contractor,
with whom th© union has no contacts, he doesn’t bargain, he
doesn’t employ any of their members, is the primary? and the
Board was reversed.
As Mr. Com© indicates, subsequently, in a Board case
there has been a suggesti.on that no one is 'th© primary, that,

28
whereas# at the trim© -the agreement was negotiated the union
would have had the right of enforcement? once their employer
enters into an agreement with somebody else? there is no primary.
And we think that that is flatly inconsistent with
the whole theory of the Act.
As I was indicating in my answer to Mr. Jus idee
Relinquish# and as this Court has reiterated time and again#
i,

most recently in the Machinists case# preemption case# last year#
the theory of the Act is to center labor conflict in the
bargaining unit of an employer and his employees.
And th® theory of the Act is that so long as they're
dealing with lawful mandatory subjects of bargaining what the
wages are# what work the employees will insist on doing# that
is a matter not to be settled# not by outside parties# but by
a ‘test of economic strength if reason# as either side sees it#
fails.
And to say that employers can# by agreements among
themselves# change tie situation entirely and create a situation
where# even though the union does not enter into a no-strike
clause and thereby retains its right to enforce its agreement
by its normal strike weapon# it has lost that strike weapon#
and has nobody against whom it can employ economic force if
there is no primary dispute# seems to us to be flatly and
absolutely inconsistent with the genus of this Act.
I would like to conclude

because I think my time is

29

about up —• I would like at tills point to turn to a discussion
of two cases in this Court, upon which th© Board places
reliance and which w@ think they misunderstand»
The first is the Denver Building case»

In Denver

Building , the crux of the dispute was the fact that a subcontract»j
on a jobsite was employing non-union labor.

The unions who were

concerned about that did not go to th© subcontractor, rather*,
they went to th© general contractor and told hira that they
wanted the subcontractor off the job or converted into a union
contractor, or else ‘they were going to strike.
And the Board found that that was a violation of
8(b) (4) (B) .
Now, it seems to us that the plain lesson of Denver
Building Trades is that the — who has the ultimate economic
control is not determinative.

It's plain -that the general

contractor, in the Denver case, had the right of control.

He

could, both originally,as you were pointing out, Mr. Justice
Stewart, have given the contract to somebody else, and h@
could have terminated the contract, or he could have told the
subcontractor that he had to operata union on that job, at
least, or maybe over-all.
And yet, the Board found, and this Court agreed, that
that was a secondary boycott.

We don't understand how the

Board can draw any comfort from the proposition that a union
which has its real dispute with a sub can't strike the general,

30

when - right here, what the union is trying to do is to strike
the sub, who is the person who employs, the employees who have
a complaint, and the person who entered into the collective
agreement, which begins the matter in the'first place»
The second case in this Court, that the Board mentioned,
second case that the Board mentions in this Court is the SandDoor

case, the carpenters esse in 357 U.S., which Hr, Come

has mentioned.
Prior to 1959, and under the Sand Poor rule, there
were agreements that the parties could, enter into, which were
lawful, but which the union could not enforce by collective
economic action, even against -the employer with whom they
had entered into the agreement»
And the theory of Sand Door, with which we agree, is
that while those contracts were lawful under the statute as it
stood then, ‘they could not turn what was otherwise a secondary
boycott into primary activity.
And we do not argue here that the original agreement
turned what would otherwise be secondary activity into primary
activity. We simply say that the original agreement was a
traditional —
QUESTIONs

Now, what ar© you talking about, the

original agreement?
MR. GOLDs

I'm sorry.

The original agreement between

the union and Hudik, containing the work preservation clause.

31
QUESTION s Tlie collectiv© bargaining agreement# yon
mean?
MR. GOLD:

Yes. The original —

QUESTION:

Including the work preservation clause.

MR. GOLD:

Right.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. GOLD:

The original collective bargaining agreement

was an agreement on a primary subject# and that the enforcement
is also on a primary is# by perforce# primary.
QUESTION: What do you mean when you say the enforcement
is perforce primary?
MR. GOLD: Well# »**
QUESTION:
MR. GOLD:

That's Woodwork.
Yes.

What I*m trying to say# Mr. Justice

Relinquish# is that the original — you test the original
agreement by the standard stated in National Woodworks

Is the

agreement addressed to preserving the work of the employees #
the type of work they've don© on the jobsite?
And the answer in this case is yes# just as it was
in National Woodwork.
And you test the enforcement of 'the agreement by the
same standard.

And the answer again is yes# because what the

employees are trying to do is to assure that the employer
continues to observe that agreement which they feel is in their
basic long-term interest.

That's how —

32

QUESTION:

But certainly the enforcement has

consequences against Austin in this case* it could bring
pressure on Austin, doesn't it?
MR. GOLD:

Well, the agreement* if it had been liv©$

up to* would have -those consequences right from, the first day.
It is inevitable that the agreement has consequences.

Once

Hudik enters into the agreement* if he's in good faith, he has
a limitation on the terms upon which he can do business with
third persons.

He either is going to limit his bids to situa­

tions in which the bid is one h® can accept without violating
his agreement* or he's not.
And that is one of the plain consequences of every
agreement, whether it’s an agreement on hours or an agreement
on what type of work th© employees demand as a condition of
doing any *<rork.
And that is one of its intended effects.

It's an

inescapable effect.
QUESTION: Well* why don't you — aren't you arguing
that under* what is it* 150(e) * where a contract is expressly
banned except that it - except that it isn't banned if it covers
a situation like this?
*

MR. GOLD:

No* Mr. Justice White* we don't —*

QUESTION:

Well* did Congress expressly permit this

kind of a contract?
MR* GOLD:

Yes. This kind of contract is lawful in the

33
construction industry and out of the constructi.on industry»
QUESTION:

And the Board doesn’t suggest that this

agreement# in this case# is illegal?
MR. GOLD:

No.

QUESTION:

Or that it is not enforcible?

MR. GOLD:

Wall# it isn’t clear whether they said

that.
QUESTION: Well# would it be —- could you enforce it
in a 301 action?
MR. GOLD:

We don’t understand# after 1959# how we

could enforce it in a 301 action if the Board prevails here.
Because what Congress did in 1959 was say that there is a unity
between what# the type of agreement you can enter into and the
type of agreement you can enforce by economic pressure.
And sine® there’s such a unity# what we think is happening is
that we’re being shot down piece by piece.
First# we’re told that w® can’t enforce it because it
would be a violation of 8{b)(4)(B)? then the next step will be
that since it’s a violation of 8(b) (4) (B) to enforce it#
insisting on enforcement is

demonstrat® idiat it’s an 8(e)

violation.
QUESTION:

Well# I would think — and maybe you do
of
just coras right out and say that be cause/ Cong res s * express
approval of a contract like this# and because of its express
provision that in 301 actions you can enforce a contract# that

34

this provision, this construction of the Board is just simply
contrary to th© intent of Congress .
MR. GOLD: Absolutely.

I mean, that is what we®re

saying.
I just want to male© one thing clear, because I don51
want to take advantage of a question which I believe aids my
cause, and than find out I misunderstood it.

We’re not saying

that this is — that this contract is legal because of the
so-called construction industry proviso to Section 8(e); we’re
saying that this is a primary clause, would be lawful in th©
eontruction industry or in any other industry.
QUESTION:
MR. GOLD:

Oh, you want to win more than your case.
No.

No.

It’s just that -*~

QUESTION % Well, let’s just assume — let’s just assume
ie question was:

Does the eonstruction industry proviso cover

this case?
QUESTION:

Your answer to that is no, isn’t it?

MR. GOLD:

My understanding is that the construction

industry7 proviso doesn’t cover this case, because —
QUESTION:

In 'barms of validating the contract.

MR. GOLD:

Right.

QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. GOLD:

Because our understanding is that it

relates only to the contracting and subcontracting of work on
a site, and here the problem is, in part, a problem of what work

35
is to ba don© off-sit© and what work is to be don© on-site.
And, therefore, our source of validation is that the »
QUESTION:

I see. All right.

MR. GOLD:

“«* that the agreement — the desire of

these employees to preserve their traditional work is a primary
demand.

It’s the same type of demand a group of factory workers

could make, saying: We don’t want you to contract out assembly
line work which we have always don© in this plant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, putting it a little differently

your contention -that the contract is legal is because you under­
stand that it’s within the rational® of Natiemal Woodworkers?
MR. GOLD s

Abs © 1utely.

QUESTIONs

Y@s.

MR. GOLD:

And — I can’t add to that, and I won’t

try.
I want to point out, although it is a secondary
aspect of our argument, that the Board says that we must have
an object, a secondary object in this case, because the
employer has only two choices;

either he can cease doing —

the employer Hudik

either he can cease doing

he can

business with Austin, or he can attempt to get a change in toe
agreement between Austin and himself.
And, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is a
third option.

If ' somebody breaches an agreement, he can seek

to pay a premium or some other compensation for the breach, and

36
get or with the work.
As Mr. Come indicates, that isn’t a choice that any
contract breaker really relishes.

But to say that it doesn't

exist, and that there are only two choices, seems to us to b©
illogical in the extreme.
Finally, I do want to note — I do want to take up
a point that the Board makes in its Reply Brief, in terms of
the so-called secondary object conjoined with the primary object.
It's our view that that type of approach destroys the
primary-secondary dichotomy.
Let me give two examples, in addition to the example
here, to show that this is not a sui generis situation.
«

Suppose that the employees meet and discuss the matter
among themselves and decide that they do not want to work week­
ends?

That's hardly an unrealistic hypothetical, as the

members of the Court who heard th© Jewel Tea case will remember.
Thereafter, their employer enters into an agreement
with somebody else, which requires him to have three shifts,
seven days a week, in order to complete the work.
As we understand the Board's theory, this primary
agreement becomes t-nenforcible, because the employer has given
away his right of control.

He would have to renegotiate his

agreement with the general contractor from whom he accepted this
bid, knowing that it was inconsistent with th© agreement he had
made with the union

37
Except that agreement wouldn’t be covered

QUESTION:

by the language of the statute# would it?
MR. GOLD:

The hours# whether employees will work

eight to four# and whether they will work Monday through
Friday -QUESTION:

I mean# be covered by the language in

8 (b) (4)(B) .
MR. GOLD:

I'm sorry# Your Honor# I don’t understand.

QUESTION: Well# I just don't think your hypothetical
would

come within 8(b)(4)(B).

is
MR. GOLD:

Well# the other piece /that the employees

refuse to work at all# unless he no longer requires them to
work on the weekends as a condition of their continued employ"
meat.

That would be precisely this case.
In other words# her© the employer says:

You do this

work# but you don't get to do-the other work you want.
In the case I am positing# the employer says;

If

you want to continue to work for me# you have to do the work
on the weekends.
They say:
He says:

No# we don't want to work on weekends.
That's a matter outside my control now# I’ve

agreed with 'the general contractor to run three shifts.
And it seams
QUESTION:

But you think the language of 8(b)(4)(B)

covers the hours of work# the agreement to work seven days a

38

week?

I just don’t think-the language applies.
MR. GOLD?
QUESTION:

I don’t think teat —
They are not ceasing to do business with

another employer.
MR. GOLD: Well, the employer -»
QUESTION:

The basic language.

I'm saying the basic

prohibition in 8(b)(4)(B) just doesn't fit teat example, as I
read it.
MR. GOLD:

Well, that

I don’t know if you’re

referring to a «-“
QUESTION: Well, hex’© you say you can’t do work on
these other, you know, on the products you bought from a third
party? but you don't have the third-party situation, I don’t
think, in your hypothetical example.
MR. GOLD:

Well, in the hypothetical example, the
/

employees won't do the work that the third party tenders under
the agreement.
All right, let me just’ ~~
QUESTION:

They'll do it for five days but not for

seven, that’s all.
MR. GOLD:

That's right. And part of the agreement

between the employer and another «*- in other words
QUESTION:

Well, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have —

MR. GOLD; Well, no, I apologise? obviously, I don’t
want to give examples white don't further my argument, when I

39

feel the argument stands on its merite»
It's just that the Board says that this situation is
sui generis.

W© don8t believe that it is.

V?© think the

problem is the same whenever employees negotiate an agreement
with their own employer, and then that employer enters into an
inconsistent contract with a third person, says:

You can’t

enforce your collective agreement against me, because I am now
a nautral.
