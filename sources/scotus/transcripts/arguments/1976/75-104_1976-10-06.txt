ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN,' ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEWIN 2

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice# may it'please the Courts
The constitutional issue presented by this case, which
)

is here on certiorari to tee Court of Appeals for the Second

Circuit# is whether a legislative

apportionment which

deliberately limits the white population of certain Assembly
and Senate Districts for New York State to not more than 35
percent of the total number of citizens in each of those
Districte is consistent with tee Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments.
A majority of the court below# two judges# said that
our argument that such districting is unconstitutional has# and
I quote# nintellectual appeal an the surface55.

Arid even the

Solicitor General, in his brief# says that our contention has#
quote#, "consideraisle superficial appeal".
Each then proceeds with an involved effort to justify

4
what was don© here by the New York Legislature.
we submit, the effort simply failed.

In each case,

We believe that th©

instinctive response to this set of facts, the simple reaction
that such a districting scheme cannot be correct and cannot be
constitutionally valid is the proper result, and that th©
contrary view is not what Congress contemplated in the Voting
Rights Act and not what is contemplated by the Fifteenth
Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, in your opening statement you

said 53deli.beratew j what do you mean by way of intent or knowledge
or that sort of thing by the use of that adverb?
MR. LEWINs

By the use of that adverb, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, I mean that the individuals drawing that line had
that as the primary and dominant criterion in their mind. They
said not the result of what w© have done is by happenstance,
or because it’s one of many factors to produce a not more than
35 percent white citizenry in that district? but that is what
we are going to achieve.

That's what we intend to achieve.

Districts that will have not more than 35 percent, whites in them.
And that’s what I mean by deliberate.
I think more so than any other case that has previously
been before this Court, where allegations of racial gerrymandering have been made, the record in this case is undisputed.

I

think there's really no question about the fact that th©
individuals responsible for drawing the lines did it for that

5

reason, and 1 would say almost that reason only»

That’s why the

line was drawn,
QUESTION; But if we adopt your principle, and I
suppose in all future cases like this the committee chairman,
perhaps the Legislators themselves, could be examined on
depositions as to what their primary motive was when they voted
this or when they sat on committee and decided to recommend it.
MR. LEWIN:

I think in the ordinary, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, there’s a lot of difficulty in determining what such
a motive is.

That’s why this Court has prevented interrogations

or investigations of legislative motive, because there’s a
variety of motives that combine to produce a particular result.
And -there’s really no way of knowing what a Legislature has
done.
But in this case there’s just no question, where,
in the unique cases, as this one is, where the legislative
purpose is set out and is stated in the legislative record and
is not disputed, we believe it’s entirely proper for a court .
to say, "May a Legislature do this?

Is it permissible for a

Legislature to act in that way?"
And we think, on that account, that our claim is
really quite different from what the ~ the way -the respondents
would like to characterise our claim, both the Solicitor General
and the NAACP, which is intervenor in this case, in its brief,
have been asserting, I think throughout, that our contention is

6

that legislators .may not tnko a ?ounfc, in sow® way that legis­
lators of course do in the real world, of what the racial
distribution is of districts which result from apportionment.
We’re not saying that they may not review the Census
material, and others know what is happening; what our argument
is is that that may not b® the criterion, -the principle,
standard, and guideline that they're using.
Wow, let me —
QUESTION;

But here you don't have to call on any

subjective factors, that's what you're saying, isn't it?
MR. LEWINs That's absolutely right, Mr, Chief Justice.
In this case there is no subjective factor, there's no dispute

as to the fact..
QUESTIONS And yet, if you lay down a principle, as
you say, in -this case that where the primary factor that they
considered was what you've outlined, in any future case, on
the basis of normal rules of evidence, you're going to open up
to proof on the part of the

plaintiffs the issue of whether

or not this or that was the primary fact.
MR. LEWINs Well, I must say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
it seems to me that the courts can sat up a threshold which you
have to meet with a preliminary showing before you can engage
in such an investigation.
it

I don't think we're suggesting that

op'".! for any plaintiff to come in and say, I'll put the

entire Legislature on the stand and interrogate them as to their

7
motive.
In this case we have, X think, from the legislative
report itself, from the undisputed history of how this apportion­
ment developed,

the necessary inference that any court and,

indeed, the defendants, I think, admitted as much in their
answer.

We —
QUESTXON:

But you don’t need to go beyond the

proposition that where it appears on the. face of the legislative
record that this was the purpose, would that take care of the
subjective problem that Mr. Justice Rehnquist raises?
MR* LEWIN:

Yes, I think it would, Mr® Chief Justice.

And we'd accept that test, certainly, that where it appears on
•the face of the face of the reports in the legislative record,
that that is what the Legislature is doing®
missible®

Then it's imper­

And then, maybe, the burden falls on the other side,

which was represented in court ~ X mean that’s one of the
reasons, really, -that we filed this suit against the Attorney
General, where we’re here being challenged in 'this Court over
•the fact that the Attorney General is a party.
Well, one of the reasons why the suit was filed
against the Attorney General was precisely to afford all
parties an opportunity to cose in and explain whether there was
any justification for this, and there was no justification for
this apportionment, and not justification for what preceded it®
And that's why the record comes to this Court in its

8
present state# where the facts are undisputed and lead
invariably to that one conclusion»
QUESTION; But couldn't you have intervened in the
action by the state against the Attorney General# when the
State was challenging the Attorney General’s rather amorphous
reaction to its districting plan?
MR» LEWIN% There’s two reasons why we couldn’t do
that.

One is that# unfortunately# the State# because of the

exigencies of time# never challenged.

They never took it to

court# and when several legislators who were dissatisfied with
what the Attorney General had done and had instituted suit in
the district court# it was dismissed for lack of standing.
But the second# more important# reason# really, is
that wa didn't, know# my clients didn’t know what the product
was going to be of -the Attorney General’s decision.

It wasn't

until the New York State Assembly sat down in several very
frenzied days in May and determined that they were going to draw
the line in these legislative districts in such a manner that
this community was split in half between two districts that we
even knew what had happened# that, we even knew that there was
anything to complain about.
We would# simply along with all other citizens in
New York# possibly# or many other citizens in Hew York# have
supported the 5 72 reapportionment.

But until the ’ 74’ reapper-

tionment was enacted# we just didn’t know what it was going to

9

do to us„
Let raa just briefly# then, describe what exactly
happened with this apportionment and then proceed to outline
the relationship between the '74 apportionment and the prior
Attorney General's decision under the Voting Rights Act; a
relation that is important both to our position and to that of
the respondents0
At page 173 of the Appendix in this Court appears a
larga map of the Borough of Brooklyn and its Assembly districts,,
QUESTION:

What is the page again?

MRo LEWI IT:

Page 173 of the Appendix,,

QUESTION:
MR» LEW IN;

Thank you,
The area that we're concerned with in this

litigation is the one ‘that appears

at the uppermost northern

section of the districts marked 57 and 56? it's really a
triangular area that runs just above the United States Navy
»

Yard and is marked

is divided under this 1974 re apportionment

by the heavy black lines that divides lines 57 and 56„

And it's

in that area, that triangle# where the plaintiffs in this case
reside»
Mow, when that map is compared with the Assembly line
map that appears at page 197 of th© record, then it's quite
plain what has happened by reason of the 1974 apportionment»
Page 197 of the record contains th® Assembly lines as they
appeared under th© 1972 re apportionment.

10
And the entire triangular section, on page 197, is
all included within Assembly District No. 57.

So that under the

1972 district, the map is headed Borough of Brooklyn, City of
New York, 1971, it’s marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4,- but that was
the 1972 reapportionment.

That triangular section was all

within idie 57th Assembly District.
QUESTION % Would you point out, Mr. Lewin, what you’re
calling the triangular section?
MR. LEWIN;

This section right there, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: Thank you.
MR. LEWIN;

Which is in the upper northeast corner of

the 57th Assembly District under the 1972 reapportionment.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. LEWIN: And appears split between the 56th and 57th
Districts under the 1974 raapportionmento
I won’t refer at this time to the corresponding
Senate Districts, which appear at pages 174 and 198 of the
record, but they do the same thing.
They do the same thing.

In the 1972 reapportionment,

that triangular section was all in the 17th Senate District,
and in the 1974 apportionment it was divided by a line drawn
approximately the same place as the Assembly line, between the
23rd and 25th Assembly Districts, — Senate Districts, I'm
sorry, 23rd and 25th Senate Districts.
What was the effect of that drawing of lines on the

11
population in those districts?
The Assembly Districts under the 1972 reapportionment,
in which the plaintiffs have found themselves, was 38.5 percent
white? in other words, 61.5 percent non-white according to the
-testimony below.
The plaintiffs v?ere a minority, but a minority that was
greater than 35 pereant in their Assembly District under the
1972 appo rtionment <>
In order to achieve compliance with what the Depart­
ment of Justic® thought was an inadequate racial distribution,
they were split into two Assembly Districts, in one of which
the white population was under 12 percent, 11.9 percent, and
in the other one of which it was exactly 35 percent, precisely
in order to meet — and the testimony hero in the record by the
man who drew the lines was that he went block by block until
he achieved precisely 35 —- or 65 percent non-white population.
And that’s why bote Assembly Districts now, in which the
plaintiffs find themselves, are 35 percent or less whit®.
They were, under tee 1972 apportionment, in a Senate
District teat was approximately 65 percent whit®, that was the
17th Senate District? they are now, under the 1974 apportionment,
in two Districts, one of which is 28.9 percent white, under 30
percent, the other one of which is approximately the same as
the other, the earlier 17th Senate District, it’s 65 percent
white.

12
So they are now in two Senate Districts, one of which
with a very small white population, again meeting that 65/35
standard, under 30 percent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lawin, isn't there seme uncertainty

in this record, who it was that told the draftsman of the 574
apportionment they should
MR. LEWXN:

have 65 percent non-white?

I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the

record certainly contains no uncertainty.

Mr. Scolaro

testified that he had several meetings with representatives of
the Department of Justice.

He testified, I think, in some

detail, as a matter of fact, as to the nature of the conversa­
tion.

He said, MWe had talked” — I asked him what percentage

is needed, and they said ~~
QUESTIONs

In other words, a choice of the 65.

suggestion in his testimony is.

MR. LEW IN;
70 percent all right?"

Yes, it was.

And he says — I said, "Is

This is at pag© 105 of the Appendix.

”1 said how much higher do you have to go?"
His point was, one of these Districts is 61.5 percent
non-white.

"How much higher do you have to go?”

"Is 70 percent

all right?"
"They didn’t say yes or no, but they indicated it is
more in line with the way w© think in order to effect the
possibility of a minority candidate being elected within

13
that districto
,SX suggested 65 percent.

It cam© out at that tine

that is a figure used by the NAACP in numerous briefs and other
documents."
So it was tiie product of his discussions.
At other portions of his testimony, he indicated that
it was entirely as a result of those discussions, although he
couldn’t pinpoint a particular conversation/ that he cam© away
with the 65 percent figure.
Now, the Department of Justice, again I have to
emphasise, was present at tills hearing.

There was an Assistant.

United States Attorney at the hearing.

The United States

Department of Justice had every opportunity to put on attorneys
of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division if they
made no such suggestion to Mr. Scolarov. and to refute their
testimony.

Mr. Scolaro was by no means a friendly witness.

He was tii© man who had drawn the lines for the New York State
Assembly.
There was only silence from the Department of Justice,
and now, in the appellate stages, both in the Court of Appeals
and in this Court, everyone is pointing the finger at everyone

And then the plaintiffs are told, well, yon can't sue
the Attorney General, and you don't have any claim against the
State officials, either, to remedy tills dictated quota which
somebody clearly imposed, because it was definitely used on a
block-by-block basis —
QUESTION:

Pardon me, Mr. Lewin, do you think quotas

in every instance would be improper in reapportionment cases?
MR. LEWIN:

We -- our initial argument, Mr. Justice

Brennan, is yes? that in every instance racial quotas are
improper in reapportionment cases.
It would be appropriate, and we try to point up an
analogy to it in the employment situation, it would be
appropriate, we think, for a Legislature to say we*re drawing
up a districting scheme, and we will look to see what effect
that districting scheme has cn racial distribution*

And if it

seems to have, as an employer might by looking at his work
force say, Look, -this seems to work a diminution of what should
be minority voting; we have to make corrections.
And I think in those circumstances it may be a test,
it may be, looked to, it may be considered.
QUESTION:

Which -- from what you've just said, I

gather you're suggesting there might be appropriate justification,
but that at. least the burden would be upon the user of the
quota to justify its use? is that it?

15

Brennan, —

beyond that constitutional prohibition.

QUESTION:

Well, wasn’t that the argument?

MR. LEWIN:

That’s the argument.

But the only thing

•that compliance with Section 5 required was that New York enact
a statute which it could sustain, if not through the Attorney
General, through a declaratory judgment action in a federal
court.
The Attorney General made no finding that the earlier

General mads no finding that the earlier statute did have the
effect of discriminating on account of race.
QUESTION;

If New York had litigated and the court

had ~ and if the effect of the court judgment was that either
draw these districts this way or you will have violated Section
5, you would be making the same argument here, I take it?
MR. LEWIN:

If the court had said, yes, you have to

draw it on the basis of race with a 35 percent quota, yes, I
'would be.
QUESTION; Even though the Constitution wouldn't
require it, only Section 5?
MR. LEWIN;

Yes. then I would be making the same

argument.
QUESTION:

Section 5 as construed and applied would be

MR. LEWIN;

If the court so held in that case, yes,

I would be arguing here that that would be unconstitutional.
But we think that the court would hot have so held it.

•that, this case —~ that if that were true# then the argument
that the respondents make# based on Gaffney v. Cummings# would
be somewhat closer to this case.

One distinction that we think

exists between this case and this Court's opinion in Gaffney
is that Gaffney was a determined legislative judgment to apportion

in a certain manner.

And this Court said it will not strike

that down.
Now# of course# w© have argued that Gaffney is
distinguishable because Gaffney was apportionment based on
political ideology rather than race.

But if race were the

factor# we think that would be impermissible.
As a matter of fact# we -think that Your Honor’s
opinion dissenting in the Cousins case at 466 F. 2d# we think
does demonstrate precisely that that's impermissible.

Not only

in regard to blacks# but with regard to other minorities# with
regard to this white community of Williamsburgh# -which was and
is a racial minority in the district where it resides.

Mr. Lewin, you may resume

your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Resumed
MR. LEWIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief J us id ce.

Over the luncheon recess, I have done my homework,
Mr. Justice Brennan, and read Washington vs„ Davis, which, it
appears to me, doss affect this case in one major way, and in
another subsidiary way.
The Court did hold, of course, in Washington vs. Davis
that all statistical proof goes to the ultimate question of
whether -there has been purposeful discrimination, that -that is
the constitutional test.
And it would appear to m® that the decision in
Washington v, Davis, end the opinion is consistent in that
regard with our position that it- is really not necessary for
*

the Court to consider the statistical impact of any particular
apportionment if the record is as clear as it is here, on
there being a discriminatory purpose.
In fact, at the and of the Court's opinion in the City
of Richmond case, as well, the Court adverted in that opinion
to the fact that even perfectly legal results, even statistics
which would withstand analysis if examined to see what their

23
eiibc: t

co -ic: mi • “ritias. would be impermissible*

if they are done fox* racially discriminatory purposes•

And

the Court viewed a r-r.cially dis criminatory purpose as being, as
it were, a gross racial slur which can have no credentials
whatever.

And in that regard quoted from the 1918 opinion that

Acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to
accomplish an unlawful end.
QUESTION;

Well, Hr. Lev/in, is it that clear in this

esse that what was done was a purposeful racial slur?
MR. LENIN: Tie think — we think it is.

We -think,

although it was dona for the nine purposes, it was a diminution
of the racial — the effect of a particular racial group

If, in fact, in order to diminish the voting power

Well, actually, it was the other way

QUESTION:
around, wasn't it?

If — what we*re told and what you read

us earlier, what happened was, it isn’t that, you can have only
35 percent whites, it is that you must have at least 65 percent
blacks.
MR. LEW IN:

Well, no, -that’s — again, the peculiar

way of all of 'this —
QUESTION:

And therefore you’ve got the blacks here,

•that we were including among blacks the Puerto Ricans, aren’t
we?
MR. LEWIN: Well, we’re not. only including Puerto
Ricans, but, according to the New York State Legislature, we’re
including "others”„
In other words, it’s quite clear, from the submission
of the NAACP

Mid I think that’s what is really most disturbing

about this, is that it is a submission which argues that
there is -die white community and -the rest of th© world, the
non-white community.
To anybody, as Judge Frank®1 noted, who is familiar
With New York, it’s pure fiction to speak of the rest of that
community, blacks and Puerto Ricans, as merged together, and
others, as merged together in the non-white community.
Only if one looks at it as a means of reducing the
possibility of electing white legislators — and that, the
interesting thing is that that emerges so clearly from the

26
NAACP submission to the.; D&partment of Justice, that they speak
over and over again about the white incumbents, and the need to
allow other than white incumbents in the Legislature in Mew
York»
This was not a measure or a disapproval based on taking
a particular racial minority, such as blacks, or a group such
as Puerto Ricans, it was really the Department of Justice
saying:

whites are simply not covered by the Fifteenth Amendment

or by the Voting Rights Act.
We’re quoted in our Reply Brief what strikes us as an
extraordinary passage out of the Department of Justice’s
memorandum justifying its approval of -the 1974 lines, in which
they say, in the clearest language, what'—

Brief»

QUESTION:

What page?

MR, LEWIN:

This appears at page 12 of our Reply

Well, it’s 11 and 12c

It’s at page 293 of the Appendix.

In which 'the Department of Justice says clearly that in their
view, the Fifteenth Amendment and the Voting Rights Act is not
designed to protect Hasidic Jews, persons of Irish, Polish or
Italian descent, none d those are within tha special protections
defined by the Congress in the Voting Rights Act, nor within
the Fifteenth Amendment»

The entire memorandum focuses on the fact that the
only people who are protected by the Voting Rights Act and the
Fifteenth-Amendment are blacks and Puerto Ricans.

27

But it's not the same tiling to say that

QUESTION:

Irish and Hasidic Jews and so forth are not protected as a
minority,, and to say that whites as a minority are not protected.
Is it?
MR. LENIN; Well, the whites as a minority in a
particular area may happen to b©, as they are in this case,
Hasidic Jews or Irish or Italian.

It's true the Irish or

Italian, as an entire group, may not be protected, but the
white ~~ a white Irish community in a particular area which ends
up being a minority is protected.
Just as in White v. Reges ter, the Mexican-Americans
in Bexar County, I think this Court focused on the MexicanAmericans in that county, not Mexican-Amari cans in their entirety
throughout the State, but those that were in the particular

county, and said:

As to those, they had been denied rights

protected by the Fifteenth Amendment.
QUESTION s

Mr. Lawin, you perhaps think it‘s your

strongest case to say that there was a purpose to discriminate
against, or to disentitle or to diminish the rights of a white
— of the whites; but wouldn't you foe making the same arguments
if the purpose was to, on a racial basis, to improve the
situation of Negroes or —
MR. LENIN; well, U3 have never challenged the bona

the State officials.

QUESTION;

Wall, constitutionally, and let's suppos®

the express purpose of the Legislature was to increase the
likelihood of Negroes getting to be elected and getting to be
candidates, and so they said, Let's make it 65 percent non-white,
or let’s assume it was 65 percent black, in as many districts
as possible?
MR. LEWIN;

We think it's two sides of the same coin.

You can't separate —

So you would be making the

Of course, because that - —-

those.
And tho

evils of that

QUESTION;

— yes?

Mr. Lewin, would this have any unfortunate

or marked tendency to cut against the whole efforts to have an
integrated society?
MR. LEWIN; We think, Mr. Chief Justice, it most
definitely does.

And we've expanded in snore length than I

suppose I have time now, to go into, on the harms we think it
does ♦
What it does is it caters to the notion that there is
racial polarization in voting.
QUESTION;

Again, the NAACP —

Well, it does more than that, it urges —

it presses people to move into blocks.:

where they have other

29
Chicanos or other Puerto Ricans or other Negroes, or any other
minority group, or group that regards itself as a minority*
MR. LEWIN:

It. encourages them to move into that'
ft

area, it encourages voting on the basis of race in the ballot
box.

It’s exactly what this Court said in Anderson v. Martin

would not be permitted.

If you

can have a racial designation

on a ballot in order to get the black community to vote for
black candidates, on® would think that might very well help the
election of blacks.
And yet this Court has said the State may not make
that an element, in the electoral process.
In fact, the interesting tiling is — and the statistics
that emerge from the NAACP brief, they are not in 'the record
because this happened after -the case below? but the NAACP has
in its brief the statistics regarding the consequences of the
vote in 1974.

And it says in 1974, after this apportionment,

there were non-whites elected in the three' Senatorial' Districts
— this appears at pages 26 and 27 in the NAACP brief — in
the -three Senatorial Districts which were mads overwhelmingly
non-white, and in the seven Assembly Districts, all of which
were made overwhelmingly non-white.
That gave blacks, really, 43 parcent of the representa­
tion of Kings County, substantially over the 24 percent black
population.
But the interesting thing is that, according to the

30
footnote,, that happened in 19 74, but it did not happen since.
In other words, in the subsequent election, according to the
NAACP, whites now represent also two of the Assembly Districts
which are overwhelmingly black and two of the Senate Districts.
Although originally, 1 think precisely because this emphasis was
placed on getting black or non-white districts, voters were
being encouraged to go into that ballot box and vote on ths
basis of race.
And that is, w® think, squarely contrary to what the
Fifteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment are designed
to encourage.

They're designed to encourage voting on the

basis of individual merits of candidates and not things such as
race.
And -that distinguishes Gaffney v„ Cummings as well.
Gaffney v. Cummings was a deliberate apportionment, according
to Democratic — the candidates, Democratic and Republican
candidates.

Whether a candidate is a Democrat or a Republican

appears on the ballot.

The State encourages voting on the

basis of political affiliation. That’s part of our political
process.
Anderson v. Martin has said you can't put on the
ballot the rac® of a candidate, you can’t put on a ballot toe
atonic identification of a candidate.

Obviously those are

things which will b® encouraging voters to vote on the basis of

criteria which the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were

31
designed to override.

And yet, the Solicitor General and the

State and the Interveners here are arguing that a racial
fairness formula is perfectly appropriate,
QUESTION:

Mr, Lewin, would it be a valid objection

to a reapportionment scheme for a legislator to be concerned
that a new line would split the clients you represent into two
different groups?
MR. LENIN: We think it would be a valid criteria.
We -chink that that’s one of -the criteria that always apply,
Mr. Justice Stevens, by people who draw the lines. They decide
where are the communities, what have been traditional boundaries,
that kind of filing has been used in the past, and we think it
is a permissible criteria.

So we think a Legislature could use that.
But I think we have to —
QUESTION:

In other words, they should seek to

preserve existing groups that presumably vote as a block, but
that they should not create any new blocks? is that it?
MR. LEWIN: Well, I think they should preserve existing
groups, irrespective of whether they vote as a block.

I think

neighborhoods —■»
QUESTION:

But if they're not assumed to vote as a

block, what is the interest in trying to preserve them
cohesively?
MR. LENIN: Well, I think there are various interests•

32
One interest one can think of is simply that in the
electoral process there are ways that candidates have of
reaching voters through their community groups.

In other words,

a candidate goes in and says, Well nov?, I will speak

it

may be in a synagogue, it may b® in a hall or s lodge that *—
or an ethnic center of some kind? and that’s traditionally
done by candidates„

So it makes sens© from a totally neutral

legislative standpoint to say wa would like to preserve that,
so that ‘the candidates can get their message through to the
*

voters, ©van if they don’t vote as a block.
But that all the candidates hsould be able to get
through to the voters through these various community groups.
QUESTION: Well, tailing it one step further, if you
started with your group being broken into two districts, could
the Legislature permissibly decide, for fch© reasons you’ve. juststated, they would like to put this entire group in on®
district?
MR. LEWIN:
arguing -that it must.

I think it could.

But we are not

I think it may, because

And with, I think, traditional reapportionment

standards,

I think a Legislature may say various elements and

criteria enter into apportionment, and tills Court noted in
Gaffney that is not a mindless process.

and those who male® determinations make these, judgments on the
basis of a wide variety of factors. And they could and should

QUESTION;

What if the New York Legislature had been

proceeding on the general Gaffney v, Cummings approach, but on®

35
of their sub-hypothesss was that blacks ©ad Puerto Ricans in
Brooklyn tend to vote Democratic, and therefore we're going to
create a couple of Democratic Districts here, and the way we will
do this -is to include 65 percent of blacks, Puerto Ricans and
others; would there be any tiling wrong with that?
MR. LEWIN:

If the Legislature's objective is

political, w© think that's permissible under Gaffney v, Cummings,
even though they may use racial criteria in determining how
■the political affiliation is arrived at.
Mow, I think there are other — I mean, as I think of
the hypothesis that you put forward, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
I suppose since the Legislature has other ways of determining
Democratic and Republican affiliation, such as registration
statistics, it might be an impermissible way of getting what is
really registration statistics.
Bui; I would think initially, if the Legislature is
saying, what we're doing is looking to make a political
distribution, that's a permissible distribution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, ju&t so I know what 'the facts

are in the case, isn't it true that after this districting,
this r©apportionment occurred, the white community in general
had not been disenfranchised, or its representation hadn't been
diminished?
MR. LEWIN; Well, I don’t know how you define it.

see in the NAACP brief., there were 43 percent —
QUESTION: Well, let me put it this way — which is a

I intend — was the white representation any less than its

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS II. POLLAK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF INTERVENORS NAACP, ET AL.
MR. POLLAK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
Together with ray colleagues,

Messrs. Greenberg and

38
Schnapper, I represent; the NAACP, which intervened in the
district court in this ease, to oppose Petitioners' claim that
the lines adopted by the New York Legislature in 1374 to
delineate the Assembly and Senate Districts in the County of
Brooklyn unconstitutionally abridged the franchise of
Petitioners and other whites resident in that county»
In the short time available to me, I will attempt to
advance two linked propositions, namely that the 1974 lines are
constitutionally proper both as to purpose and as to affect»
But before advancing these propositions, I will, with
the Court's permission, try to address a few preliminary words
to two critical aspects of this case»
The first has to do with the anomalous nature of
Petitioners * constitutional claim; the second goes to the
peculiar procedural posture of this case, a case which comes
here, if -the Court please, not after a full trial but after a
very brief hearing on Petitioners' motion for preliminary
injunction, I submit, a far too truncated record to begin to
sustain Petitioners' extraordinary claim of proof -that the
State of New York and the Attorney General of the United States
hae collaborated to abridge Petitioners' constitutional rights»
Nov.*, in saying that Petitioners' claim is anomalous,
I have in mind two aspects»
To the extent, that Petitioners are in effect asserting
a constitutional entitlement to have their Hasidic community

39
remain forever in a single voting district? I submit that they
are arguing for a preference? whether it be denominated in
ethnic or religious or? indeed? a political preference which is
unknown to the Cons titution »
QUESTION § Vie 11? does that mean — does that require
an. assumption that that’s the way it was constructed in the
first place?
MR. POLLAK;

No? Your Honor,

I submit that on whatever

basis -those persons have come together? they are no more
entitled than any others in the American population to remain
a discreet voting districto
QUESTION;

But they claim? their claim is -that you

can't cut them up for a non-neutral purpose? isn't that their
claim?
MR. POLLAK;

I believe tliat is correct? Your Honor?

and I was just about to go, on? Mr» Chief Justice? to the
proviso»
QUESTION;

Well? before you do? I thought Mr» Lewin

told us he- was not arguing this case on any basis -that this was
a Hasidic community? but? rather? that this was a discrimination
against whites as whites»
MR. POLLAK; Well? I have heard that? and I believe
that is the alternative claim.
QUESTION; Alternative?
one

I thought it was the basic

40

I

MR. POLIAKs

Well, I hope that is the basic one,

because I, myself, Mr# Justice Brennan, have been trying fully
to understand where Mr. Lawin claim lies.
QUESTIONS Well, I can understand that you wish it were
his claim.

But that didn't sound like what his claim was,
MR. POLLAKs

There have been enough references to the

importance and integrity of the community as such to lead me to
believe that we at least ought to establish that that could not
be the basis for a constitutional claim in -this Court.
Unless, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, action were
taken hostile to that community because of their race or
religion, but there is not a word in this record to suggest
hostility to the Hast dim as such.
In that.connection I would call the Court’s attention
-- as Mr. Lev/in already has — to Mr. Justice Stevens’ very
instructive opinion in the Cousins case, before his elevation
to this Court, the opinion in 466 Fed 2di
QUESTION; That, was a dissenting opinion.
MR. POLLAKs

That was a dissenting opinion, fir. Justice

Stewart,
[Laughter. ]
MR, POLLAKs

Though I believe you will find that, as

•the case ultimately
QUESTION: Actually, it would have been binding even
if it had been a majority opinion, wouldn’t it?

41
[Laughter.]
MR. POLLAK%

1 think Judge Fairchild would conclude

that ultimately he and Judge Stevens , as he then v;aa, were on
the same side.
Now, if, in the alternative, and I think this is the
alternative we must proceed on, Mr. Lewin is claiming that the
discrimination here is against his clients as whites, then I
must submit to this Court that any claim that Brooklyn is a
county in which whites are politically disadvantaged by virtue
of the 1974 districting lines, is, with all respect, an affront
to common sense.
And here I must disagree with my brother Lewin*s
understanding of the statistics we tried to set forth,
apparently unsuccessfully, in our brief, supplemented by a
letter from my colleague, Mr. Schnapper, which I believe has
now com® to the Court’s attention.
Whites constitute less than 65 percent of Brooklyn’s
population, but they are the majority race in 15 out of
Brooklyn’s 22 Assembly Districts, and 7 of Brooklyn’s 10 Senate
Districts.
Moreover, and this goes directly to Mr. Lewin’s, I’m
afraid, misunderstanding of the statistics we tried to set forth,
white legislators sit in 17 of the 22 Assembly Districts- and
8 of the 10 Senate seats.

They did this as a result of the

1974 election. That is -to say, they hold all white majority

42
districts eind additional non-white majority districts; 17 out
of 22 Assembly Districts in Brooklyn.. 8 out of 10 Senate seats,
and last month's primaries indicate that exactly that pattern
will continue in the general — as a result of the general
election next month„
QUESTION;

Hr, Poliak, does the constitutional

stature of the claim turn on the racial makeup of a county?
MRo POLLAK:

Your Honor, only in thi3 sense»

What

this goes to is that the effect of what has been done here is
certainly not to disadvantage,politically to disadvantage whites
in the County of Brooklyn»
QUESTION;

Mr. Lewin —

Well, whites, you know, it all depends

on what statistics you use, I suppose, but what about the two
Assembly Districts in questions?
MR. POLLAK;

I am in agreement, if Your Hcnor please,

with Mr» Lewin, who suggested -that one looks at Bexar County ~~
QUESTION;

"Bahar" it is.

MR. POLLAK;

On® looks at it, and hopefully one

learns to pronounce it correctly. Your Honor.
And here, sir, we look at Brooklyn as the political
entity, which is subject to the Voting Rights Act.

And looking

at Brooklyn as that total entity, in which Petitioners base
their constitutional claim as disadvantaged whites, it seems to

me almost frivolous to assert that disadvantage has been worked
on the white community

43

QUESTION: Well, why would you single out just one
county, if you're going at it, 'why not the whole State?
MR. PQLLAKs Because, Your Honor, the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 is invoked county by county,,
QUESTION:
of what?

Yes»

County by county»

But as components

Of a State»
MR. POLLAK:

Well, if, Mr. chief Justice, we were to

look at the State of New York as a whole, although I have not
been that ambitious to survey the entire Empire State, we would,
I submit, get a far more sweeping demonstration that the
State of New York is, like Brooklyn itself, safely in white
political hands.
QUESTION:
question

But in White vs. Regester, Mr® Poliak, the

was at-large districts for a county.

Wasn't 'that

the reason why the analysis was confined to Bexar' County?
Here you don't have districts at-large, you have single-member
districts.
HR. POLLAK:

But what you have, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

is the New York Legislature attempting to redistrict following
the 1970 Census.

Peraps it bears remembering that 'the New York

Legislature was not simply attempting, as Mr. Lewin seems to
have suggested, to address itself to -the particular purpose of
disenfranchising his clients,
It was required, under th® New York Constitution, to
redistrict the Stata following th© 1970 Census. Th® 1972 lines

44
disapproved were addressed to that purpose.
replaced the disapproved 1972 lines.

The 1974 lines

And the meeting of the

objections of the Attorney General of ‘the United States with
respect to particular disadvantage in non-compliance with the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, as it applied to Brooklyn,, was simply
on© of modest purposes of the Legislature of the State of New
York? but that was the purpose which was addressed to the County
of Brooklyn as such, because it was that county which.. I submit*
the Attorney General was directing New York's attention to in
disapproving the 1972 lines»
So I don't think we can* in fairness* reduce for the
purposes of enlaring -the claim of Mr. Lewin's white clients*
reduce the focus of this case beyond the general confines of
the County of Brooklyn* in which whites,and the memory of man
runneth not to the contryP have been overwhelmingly the
dominant group.
All four countrywide officers, Borough President,
District Attorney, two City Councilman are whit©? five of
Brooklyn's fcix Congresspersons are white.
QUESTION:

It is hard to see —

Mr. Poliak, would you tell roe whether

you think the issues, the constitutional issues in the case,
would be any different if -there had been no voting rights
problem at all, but these decisions had all been made
independently by the New York Legislature, just to correct what
it conceived to be an improper set of district lines?

45

MR, POLLAK:

It is my feeling, Mr» Justice Stevens,

that the Solicitor General has persuasively demonstrated, to
me at least, that building on the doctrine of Gaffney v,
Cummings, New York would be entitled to undertake, in furtherance
of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, to undertake to
create tee possibility of effectiveness political action — by
no means a guarantee of it? and certainly this was not
accomplished here, where many whites were elected in minority
—"in black/Puerfco Rican majority districts — to create the
possibility of effective political action for groups which are
not simply the Democratic or Republican groups identified in
Gaffney v. Cummings, but other groupings of a kind which are
)

linked politically in the very way suggested in your opinion,
Hr, Justice Stevens# which If with all apologies, refer to
again, even though it was a dissenting opinion.
So I think Gaffnay v. Cunmings would independently
support New York's action, had New York acted unprodded by the
voting Rights Act,
But, of course, tee reality of this case is that New
York moved because the Attorney General had disapproved the
<•*

1972 lines. And with respect to the constitutionality of
New York's using race as an index of how to correct, the
imbalances which the Attorney General had discerned in the
1972 lines, I submit, if the Court please, that there can be
tic

question that New York not only was entitled but indeed

46

obliged to look to race to make, to remedy what had been, after
all, racial abuses»
In that connection, —

But are you entitled to rely simply on

'the Attorney General’s finding as to 1972 in this lawsuit, or
are you required to make same showing that in fact what he
found was justified under the law?
MR. POLLAK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, were there time

enough, I would be glad to 'try to demonstrate that the Attorney
General was right, but I don’t think that is our burden or
any respondents' burden in this case, the determination was made
by the Attorney General, it was review able, had the State of
New York sought to review it, in the District Court for the
District of Columbia, when the political entity which is New
York chose not to do so, the Attorney General’s disposition
became a final one, not, I think, to be collaterally reviewed
here.
QUESTION:

Tell me, Mr. Poliak, dees what the New

York Legislature do, accepting your submission in that respect,
raise any DeFtmis type problem?
MR, POLLAK:

It does not, in my view, raise any

such problem, Mr. Justice Brennan, assuming I were sure, from
the Court's silence, What a DsFunls type problem is.
QUESTION:
[Laughter. ]

You don't know what the problem is —

4?
QUESTION?
MR, P01LAK:

— but you know -the answer®
No, if the Court please, I donst.

And

specifically, if I may say, the fact which is the predicate of
this case, that there was disapproval by the Attorney General
under the Voting Rights Act, puts this case in a position where,
a fortiori, the State of Mew York was not merely empowered but
obliged to proceed with the race of voting districts in mind.
Directly ...as to DeFunis, this is not a case in which
a preference was given to on© assertedly at the expense of
another.

This was a case in which all that was attempted, as

I understand it, taking Mr. Lewin*s case at its strongest, all
that was attempted was to create a viable opportunity for
blacks and Puerto Ricans to organise themselves politically.
And that —
QUESTION:

But you might have a different answer to

that question if the white community had been disenfranchised
to soins extent,
MR. POLLAK:

I think we ~~ that certainly would bear

on the question of effect.
But even-as to purpose, the validity of a purpose to
improve the possibility of minority political action, the
constitutional validity of such a purpose was, I think, portended,
Mr, Justice White, not merely by your question to Mr. Lewin as

to the applicability of the Voting Rights Act, but, indeed, as
my colleague, Mr, Sdhnappsr, has pointed out to me, exactly what

48
was illustrated by your hypothetical question, was of record
in the Bear case, decided by this Court last year.
Mr. Schnapper has pointed me to pages 341 to 2 of
the record in -the Beer case, in which it turns out that the
lines which this Court felt the Attorney General should not
have disapproved, those lines war© in part constructed, -the
record makes it absolutely plain, in order to effect sqm©
deliberate marginal improvement of the opportunity of black
voters in Hew Orleans to vote.
QUESTION;
MR. PQLLAK:

Without any constitutional compulsion.
And without any constitutional compulsion.

The. Voting Rights Act, Your Honor, I agree, goes beyond the
mandate of the Constitution of th© United States.
Mr. Lewin’s entire case, with respect to the invidious
purpose of the State of New York rests not on proof of what
legislators intended, it rests on testimony of what one staff
assistant to a legislator said. And, indeed, th© allegations of
Mr. Lswin's complaint do not directly link th® Legislature
of New York, except vicariously, with that attributed quota.
And again I repeat, the entire proof comes up on a
motion for a preliminary injunction, and surely this truncated
record could not be a responsible basis for this Court• making
a deliberate adjudication of a case which purports to challenge
the constitutionality of action taken by th© sovereign Legis**
latura of New York and the .Attorney General cf the United States,

49
I would not like to conduct the trial portended by
Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question to Mr. Lewin, in which
legislators of New York ara called to the witness stand to
testify 83 to what their purpose was in enacting these laws»
Suffice it to say, there is no such testimony here, and it
has, 1 think, been this Courtis unbroken and understandable
wish ever sine© Fletcher vs. Peck to avoid inquiries of -that
kind, and yet they would b© necessary were this case to be
pursued.
QUESTION: Even if it appeared on the face of the
record without calling any legislators that that was the purpose?
MR, POLLAK:

Mr, Chief Justice, I think all we can say,

and I do call attention to the details of Mr, Lewinss complaint,
I think all we can say is that even Mr* Levin in his complaint
only asserts that the 65 percent quota was an opinion
communicated to employees of the Joint Committee.
I am referring to paragraph 22 through 24 of Mr.
Levin’s complaint.

The attribution to the Legislature as such

is not, I think, made by the record before this Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
on the Solicitor General5n time.

Mr. Poliak, you are now

If he acquiesces, that’s up

■bo him.
MR. POLLAK:

Well, if I may —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
acquiescence.

I see no signs of

50
[Laugh tar. ]
MR# POLLAKs

If 1 — I am chary of trespassing on my

friend, the Solicitor General’s time, but I will simply take
closing seconds to submit that this is a case, if the Court
please, which cannot be decided in Mr# Lewin's favor on this
foreshortened record#

It is my own belief that if the Court

sees substantial constitutional claims left, which I do not
see, it must, follow the path of remand#
E’er our part, we think the complaint was properly
dismissed, because -there is not even prima faci® a showing of
invalid purpose or invalid affect#
Ibis would bo true if New York had bean acting unprodded
by -the Attorney General#

It is true, a fortiori, where what

New York Did was to legislate to achieve compliance with a
congressional mandat© in furtherance of Congress9 awesome
power, to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments#
In conclusion, Mr# Chief Justice, I would urge that,
in this Bicentennial Year, fidelity to the Declaration and the
Constitution, those instruments of government honored in this
Court, not ceremonially and not at intervals, but emphatically
and every day, requires affirmance of the judgment below#
Thank you#
MR# CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr# Solicitor General.

51
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
I would like, in the brief time available, to concen­
trate upon the merits of Petitioners* claims and leave the
question

of the Attorney General’s position as a party in this

case to our brief.
I think the question of the claim under the Voting
Rights Act, which X3 made in the complaint, is also taken care
of by the brief.

It has not been very clarified that there is

no claim made that there is discrimination against the Hasidim
as s uch.
QUESTION: What’s the government’s interest in the
merits of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claim if the status
of the Attorney General as a party is put to one side?
MR. BORK:

The government's interest becomes then,

Mr. Justice Relinquish, preserving the Voting Rights Act of 1965
/"

from a ruling which I think would effectively destroy its
application to apportionment.
The case turns upon. Petitioners' claims as members of
*3» whits races, and I think I can shqiw rather quickly that
analysis demonstrates that they have no valid claim of
unconntifcutional discrimination on the basis of that.

And, for

purposes of clari?#, I would like to discuss first the general

52
constitutional issue? and second I will examine the question
of whether the Attorney General's involvement in the facts?
in the redistricting process? alters that conclusion in any way.
Petitioners’ central contention appears to be the
redistricting may not be dona so as to produce any particular
racial composition in a voting districte

And I think acceptance

of that contention would have two results? each of which is
completely foreclosed by constitutional law®
The first would be the effective destruction of the
application of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act? to reappor­
tionments o
The second? which seems to me equally bizarre? would
be that districting itself would b< made unconstitutional unless
done by a person who can be proved to have no idea of the ethnic
or racial composition of the community he was dealing with?
or preferably dona by a computer that was not programmed to
have any such information»
QUESTION:

How was districting done before all these

problems arose? let us say? 100 or 150 years
MR. BORKt

/.go?

It was done by Legislatures,

QUESTIONs

Yes? but what guidelines?

Geographical?

MR. BORKs

I think, Mr. Chief Justice? -the guidelines?

largely?

as history shows? were racial? political? geographical?
preservation of communities, all this —

53
QUESTIONs

Wall, it certain! shows that they were

often politicalo
MRo BORIC:

I think that's true, Mr« Chief Justice.

But that's why I say that acceptance of their argument, I think
— well, for the reason, I'll state this;

You can't do

redistricting without having racial considerations in rainci,
unless you're willing to forget about the Vot .ng Rights Act
of 1965.
It’s impossible to be sure that the re’s no effect of
abridging anybody's voting right on account o:: his race, of a
racial group, if there hasn't been retrogress:.on, unless the
persons who draw the district lines know the :,„mpact they are
having upon a rac;.al group.
Now, there has bean great play here upon the word
"quotas”, and it's a word I don't greatly care for in most
contexts, but. it must be said that; the Piftee tth Amendment,
implemented by the Voting Rights Act, and under either the
majority or the. minority position in .Beer, somebody has to
decide whether a racial group has been dropped below a certain
position in a voting districto
Now, Mr, Lewin can call that a quota, if he wants to,
and get whatever emotional connotations there are in that word,
but that happens to be the result of the Fifteenth Amendment
as it worked out to date.
Thus f it seems to me the Petitioner.- 5 claim is

54
necessarily that the Voting Rights Act itself is unconstitutional
and that claim has been decisively rejected by this Court,
beginning with South Carolin •: v. K&tzenbach.
And let me say one other thing that Petitioners , 1
think, have confused here»

The 1972 plan devised by the State

of New York served many purposes# the redistricting, as it
always does# served many purposes»

It was revised after the

Attorney General objected in a very minor — in one area to
its racial impact, and only the revision had a racial purpose
to it# but other purposes would continue to be served by the
redistricting0
So it is not true that this is a districting which
is entirely racial in any way.
And if we*re going to litigate every modification of
a plan made under — by a Legislature, it will be endless.
But Petitioners6 argument is worse than destroying
the Voting Rights Act, I think.

They are really saying that

any r®districting of New York by its Legislature would be
unconstitutional, for it is perfectly clear that politicians
are aware of the racial and ethnic makeup of neighborhoods,
net only of their own constituencies but of other constituencies,
and it’s perfectly clear that how the lines are drawn is going
to affect, the outcome of elections.
To tell a politician, who knows that, that he must
not 'think about it, is about as effective as telling a lawyer

55
he must not think about which argument, is lik ly te prevail
on a court when he has a case to try.
It is about as effective as telling somebody that
for the next three seconds he must not. think .about the word
"hippopotamus".
[After a pause]

I have waited thr oe seconds , I

will ~~
[Laughter. 3
MR. BORKs

That means that Petition ers9 constitutional

theory cannot be carried out unless the funefe .on of redistricting
is taken away from Legislatures altogether and consigned to
courts or to computers, which is not what the Constitution
requires.
As Gaffney v. Cummings says, the apportionment task,
dealing as it must with fundamental choices al >out the nature
of representation-, is primarily a political and a legislative
process.
Wow, I think those two points, that Petitioners*
argument requires both the unconstitutional it; • of the Voting
Rights Act, as it applies to apportionment* a:id the unconstitu­
tionality of districting done by Legislatures are enough to
dispose of this case®
But I want to deal with a suggestion made; that
somehow this case did not involve such a result, because it is
unique, and it is unique because the. Attorney General is involved

56

in the case, in the process„
That factor does not alter the analysis one white
I will put Petitioners' basio contention on this score as
strongly as I can, in order bo shov? that there; is nothing to
ito
The argument runs that the Attorney General disapproved
of the 1972 plan, and in the process of discussion with meitibers
of the Department afterwards, the staff assistant from New
York got the idea, he wasn’t told, he got the idea indirectly
that he’d have to come up with a 65 percent minimum proportion
of non-whites in order to get approval.
Now, it is said, also, that to© Attorney General's
refusal to approve the 1972 plan was subsequently shown to be
wrong by toils Court's Baer decision, because proportional
representation is not required by the Act, and that the State
was thus forced into a position of redistricting in a way it
would not. otherwise have chosen.
That, it is said, requires reversal of the Court of
Appeals.

I think it does not.
I to ink there are; two answers to that argument.
The first and less important, perhaps, is that the

Attorney General could not and did not compel the 1974 plan.
He didn’t require it.

New York could have tried to convince him

that the proper test was whether the 1972 plan was ameliorative
or retrogressive.

They did not try to convince him of that.

57
They did not present him with evidence from which he could have
made that determination.
QUESTION'S

Let’s assume that the State of New York

was proceeding on -this erroneous assumption, as you describe it,
what does that do to the case, the basic issues of the case?
MR. BORKs
Justice.

i think nothing whatsoever, Mr. Chief

I think tills case has to be analysed as if the State

of New York could have chosen to do this on their own.

And

this, for that reason.
My second answer -«
QUESTION: Well, could -they do it for" the reason that
this assistant staff member’s thought was
MR. BORK3

Indeed.

I am willing to accept, for ‘the

purposes of answering your question, Mr. Chief Justice, in
answering Mr. Lewin53 contentions, I am willing to accept the
hypothesis which is contrary to fact, that the; Attorney General
•hold them he would only approve a 65 percent plan.

I will

accept that for the purposes of argument, but I think it makes
ne difference.
Now, I say that for this reason:

There was nothing

whatsoever improper about the Attorney General. * s involvement in
this process.

There’s some overtone of that in this argument.

The fact is that the Fifteenth Amendment permanently shifted
federal”state balance in this particular area, and the Voting
Rights Act, v?hich implements the Fifteenth Amendment, puts the

58
Attorney General into the redistricting process when a covered
jurisdiction conies to him rather than going to court.
And in that sense, in that constitutional sense, the
Attorney General is as much a part of tills process, but with a
different role to play, but a part of tills process legitimately
as is

the Legislature

Governor of New York,

of the State of New York, as is

the

or anybody else that plays a part in it.

Nov-?, «—
QUESTION: Well, does that mean, Mr. Solicitor General,
that in effect the Attorney General can take a particular
situation and draw -the. plan and tell the States, this must be
it or none other?
MR. BORKs

No, that — I suppose you could come to the

same conclusion, realistically, by sitting there rejecting
plans forever untoll they com© to the one he wants? but he doesn't
do that.
His only function under the statute — yes?
QUESTION:

Well, the State doesn’t need to

take it,

they can litigate.
MR. BORI-Is The State can go to the three-judge court
in ‘the District of Columbia and litigate, they don’t have to
corae to the Attorney General at all? and if they do go to the
court, a prior adverse decision by the Attorney General is
entitled to no legal weight in that proceeding.
But the fact — what he did here was his legitimate

59

role, and a role given to him under the Fifteenth Amendment by
the Voting Rights Act»

So that what Petitioners are doing is

bringing back, in a kind of disguised form, the Federalism
objection that was mad© to the Voting Rights Act, and
decisively rejected in South Carolina v, Kafczenbaoh»
QUESTION:

Is it true that the Attorney General, in

order to object to a plan, such as he objected to in this case,
would have to make his own judgment as to whether or not there
is block racial voting?
MR» BORK:

He takes the position, Mr. Justice White,

which was upheld by this Court, that he has bo be persuaded,
the State must carry the burden of proof with him, that there
is no denial or abridgement, just as it must before the court.
QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but I take it -that
there must foe some assumption that; there's going to be some
block racial voting, or the chances of discrimination would be
considerably less»
MR. BORK:

Well, I •think that whether there is block

racial voting is one of the questions that ha addresses himself
to when he asks them to

tall him about it.

Of course, if there is no block racial voting, or
very little, the problem becomes much less.
But the other part of this matter is, it is suggested
that the Attorney General made a mistake when he refused to
approve the 1972 plan, because he was using the theory that the

60

minority of tills Court -book in Beer,

And he should have been

taking the position the majority took»
Of course# this was before Beer was decided# and the
Attorney General was aching in the light of the lower court's
decision in Beer,
But the Attorney General must often decide before an
issue is clarified by law# aid it's no different than if New
York had gone to the three-judge court and got an erroneous
*

decision# which it didn’t appeal# or if the Legislature -had
made a mistake of law and put in a plan it didn’t have to under
the Voting Rights Act.

It’s no different than if the Governor#

with a mistaken view of what this Court would ultimately say
about the Voting Rights Act# had kept vetoing legislation by
the Legislature# until he forced them to the 1974 plan or some
analogous plan.
So that in all of these cases the issue is not whether
somebody- who is legitimately in the process# ns the Attorney
General most certainly was# may have made a miscalculation
about the future course of the law? -the question in all of
-these hypothesized cases# as well as in this cases# is whether
tiie resulting redistricting violated a constitutional right.
And it seems to me that this case must be analyzed
just as if there were no Voting Rights Act# and just as if -there
were no Attorney General in it.

That means it comes down to

the question of whether a State or local government, can take

61

race into account and choose to redistrict so that there is
racial proportional representation from an area.
That may be a good idea or it may be a bad idea, but
I think that's a legislative question, because 1 don't think
there's "the slightest doubt, that as a constitutional matter a
State can do that.
And I don't really think there's the slightest doubt
that that is effectively what Gaffney v. Cummings held.

1 don't

think it's distinguishable,,
1 was quite surprised —
QUESTIONt

But there's a limit, isn't there?

MR® BORK%

Oh, there certainly is a limit, Mr® —

QUESTIONs

In Gcgg.lllion v, Lightfoot, it certainly

MR. BORK i

Oh, I was speaking, Mr. Justice Stewart,

is —

of a taking of race into account in order to achieve a rough
proportionality•

I was not speaking of a case in which you are

attacking, a race and fencing it out, as was true in Gomillion, v«
Lightfoot.

And I don't think ■—
QUESTION2

would include that.
MR® BORK:

Yes.

But your broad statement, though,

And perhaps 1 misunderstood your statement.
I did not mean to say that, I - meant to

talk about viewing race as party was in Gaffney v. Cummings.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION: when you say to achieve rough proportionality.

62
what does that mean?
MR. BORKs

Well, a State, I think, could say that

because race is a political issue and because groups in its
area do vote somewhat along racial lines, that it is going to
construct districts which are otherwise reasonably compact or
contiguous and so forth, as these districts are here, which give
a chance for something like proportional representation of the
group in the Legislature.
And I was astounded when Mr. Lewin s aid that race is
not a part of our political process.

Race has been the

political issue in this nation since it was founded.
And w© nay regret that that is a political reality,
but it is a reality, that's what the Fifteenth. Amendment is
about, what the Civil War was; about, it’s what, the Constitution
was in part about, and it is a subject we struggle with
politically today.

And I think the suggestion that wa ignore

race in order to discourage block voting is

tx ally

a suggestion

that we allow the dilution of minority votes, the abridgement
of minority votes so that they will not be encouraged to vote
together.
QUESTION:

Mr0 Solicitor General, I wonder, are you

saying to us that constitutionally proportionality, so long
as that's legitimately and honestly -the re as or for doing what
was done with these districts in Brooklyn, it’s appropriate!
but if what was don© was clone to fence out the whit® community *

then it would be inappropriate?
MR. BORK:

Yea.

If what was done was don® with the

intention of harming the white community politically, of course
it is true in —
QUESTION:

But if it’s done for the purpose of giving

a fair representation to the black community, even though it has
the effect of diluting the representation of 'he white
community?

MR. BORK:

Yes, but I think the white community,

Mr. Justice Brennan, cannot, have a claim to more, a constitu­
tional claim to more voting =>« representative strength than it
has voting strengto in the population.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK: Furthermore, throughout our history, people
have recognised ..economic interests, ethnic interests, all kinds
— religious interests, all kinds of interests in redistricting.
So it would be very strange; if blacks were the only group who
could mt. be recognized.
QUESTION: Well, accepting all that, then my question
is s

Does this record really tell us why this was done?
MR. BORK: Well, it tells us that the Attorney General

objected because ha thought 'that there was a dilution.

It

tell us that New York State got toe impression that they ought
to go to 65 parcant — by the way, it*s 63 percent, the Attorney
General thought, unless you include Chinese.

64

And apparently that’s as much as we know.
But I don't think there is a constitutional claim, and
for that reason we ask -'shat the judgment of the Court of Appeals
be affirmed.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE D.

ZUCKERMAN, ESQ.,,

ON BEHALF OF CARY, ET AL.
MR.

ZUCKERMAN:

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Thera is no dispute -that the State of New York
utilised racial statistics in drawing the 197 s radistricting
plan that is challenged by Petitioners •

But .t is alsoclear

that the use of racial considerations in the preparation of the
1974 plan was not for any invidious ; discriminatory purpose,
but was designed as a remedial measure to overcome the objec­
tions that the Attorney General of the United States had raised
in refusing to approve New York’s 1972 reapportionment
statute with respect to New York and Kings Co antias.
While this *»QUESTIONt
Mw

;yo:as

Do you think anything that was done by
v ■ M

Mih ■ v.v 'M'

r-M a:■umcM'Mai

would automatically be entitled to the word B remedial" rather

63

than "invidious" or "discriminatory5’?
MRo ZUCKERMANs

Not anything, Mr* Justice Rehnguist.

I think any fair response, reasonable in term;

of proportionality*

But if you reach a Gomillion situation, -then :: think it could
b© fairly attacked*
The State of New York does not agree with the April 1,
1974 determination of the Department of Justice, which rejected
New York’s 1972 lines* And, indeed, the Stats believes that
the recent decision of this Court in Beer vs. United states
clearly indicates that that determination of the Department of
Justice was based on an erroneous application of the Voting
Rights Act*
However, the fact remains that due :o the pressures of
time brought on by the imminence of the 1974 primary, the
State chose not to challenge the Justice Department’s determina­
tion*

As such, the Stats was required to enact new legislation

immediately to satisfy the objections of the Jepartment of
Justice.
Novr, in attempting to satisfy these objections, it
may be remembered that the Department of Justice had complained
that the 1972 districts contained an over-concentration of nonwhites in the 18th Senate District and in the 53rd through 56th
Assembly Districts,

So, to overcome these objections, it was

obviously necessary for -the State to consider tea racial
composition of individual city blocks, to transfer non-whit©

66
voters from these allegedly over-concentrated districts into
the adjoining districts of allegedly under-concentrated minority
voters o
While racial considerations are generally constitu­
tionally suspect, where such considerations have been taken in
support of a remedial measure to further integration, as was
done in this case, the use of racial, considerations has been
sustained.
We point out, at pagas 19 and 20 of our brief, many
of the cases in which the conscious use of racial considerations
by public officials has been sustained -when taken through
further integration in the areas of education, in employment,
and in promoting integrated housing.
QUESTION; What case do you think, in this Court,
supports that statement, “outside the a rest or remedy for a
cons ti tuti crxal vio 1 ati on" ?
MR. ZUCKERMAHs

Well, in Swann vs„ Charlotte-

Mecklenburg Board of Education•
QUESTIONS

It was remedy, though, wasn't it?

MR. ZUCKERMANs

Well, no —

QUESTIONS But that wasn't tee whole thing — that
wasn't the whole thing, was it?
MR. ZUCKERMANs Right.

Mr. Justice White, I would say,

in candor, there has been no holding of this Court, that I'm
aware of, teat would —

67
QUESTIONs

Just di-stum in Swann?

MR, 2UCKERMANs

Possibly,

There have been# we cit©

in our brief# some lower federal cases # in whichthe
?
Nichowsky case# for one., and —
QUESTIONs

But nothing here you can cite# except

Swann, the dictum in Swann?
MR, ZUCKERMANs

Not that I'm awar® of.

That would —

to specifically answer this question,, as to where there has bpen
no finding of past discrimination,
QUESTION: Well# what about Beer?
MR. ZUCKERMAN: Well, in Eger, the holding that was in
Beer would be inapposite to this situation,
QUESTION s Why is that?
MR. ZUCKERMANs Because they say that where a
redistricting plan constitutes an improvement over the prior
lines, this would not be a violation of the Voting Rights Act,
QUESTION:

Yes,

MS, ZUCKERMAN:

And we believe# under the facts of

the New York situation# the 1972 lines which were rejected by
the Department of Justice were definitely improvement over the
prior district lines that had been drawn in IS66.
QUESTIONs Well# do you suppose Beer would — you could
imply from Bear, infer from Bear that if then was not — if the
plan was disadvantageous to the black community# that there must
be soma lines, the lines must b@ changed even if there wasn't a

68
constitutional issue?
MR. ZUCKERMAN:
QUESTIONS

Yes, I would agree with that.

You*d have to do a fair amount of implying,

wouldn’t you?
MR. ZUCKERMANs

Yes, in those circuitstances.

We further submit that it is unrealistic to condemn a
re appo rtionment plan solely on the ground tit at it employed
racial considerations, where such considerations were utilized
■to produce a racially fair result.
And here we believe that the opinion of -this' Court in.
Gaffney vs» Cummi gs is instructive, just as politically mind­
less redistricting might produce a gerrymandered result.
We believe that a completely color-blind approach to
redistricting might also produce an unintended discriminatory
result.
Nov?, in idle Appendix to our brief, we have included
maps of the black and Puerto Rican population in .Kings County,
and it will be noted that the black population is concentrated
in the interior of Kings County, and, to a lesser axtent, so
is the Puerto Rican population.
The southern half of Kings County is almost completely
barren of blacks and Puerto Ricans.
Therefore, it would be possible, applying a color­
blind approach, to draw equal districts starting at. the
peripheries of the county and working towards the center, which

69

would produce a result in which minorities would have far fewer
districts than their population would appear to entitle them
feOo

We submit that in its attempt to prevent this
unintended discriminatory effect# the State may consider racial
considerations a
Now# we believe the basic flaw in tie Petitioners'1
approach is that fchey can point to no injury of constitutional
dimension»

While we can appreciate their desire# as a closely

knit religious group# to be confined within a single Assembly or
Senate District# there is no constitutional right for ethnic
or religious groups to be included within an. electoral district
that is favorable to 'the interests of their group.
Obviously# in Kings County# with all the many# multi­
ethnic and racial and religious groups# it would be impossible
to satisfy all their demands and still draw districts that were
equal in population to satisfy the one-person/one-vote
constitutional requirement„
Finally# ever, as white voters# we b-5Have they have
failed to show any constitutional injury# since whites# with
approximately 65 percent of the population in Kings County#
are in a . majority in 68.6 parcant of the Assembly Districts
and 70 percent of the Senate Districts.
Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further* Mr® Lewin?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR® LEWINs

If I night just take a moment* just on
%

three points* I think* that cam© up* Mr® Chief Justice* in
the course of the respondents’ argument®
First* on re-reading the NAACP*s brief and its foot­
note* I have to apologise to the Court* I did misunderstand
the words "succeeding election” that appeared in -that brief*
and read it to assume that there was an election since* which
of course I should have realised there was not®
In fact* therefore* the - statement I made to the
Court about the election of black candidates was in error end
is not what the NAACP brief indicates* and I’d just like to
with dr aw th at ®
But I think those statistics do indicate that if -the
overwhelmingly non-white districts had in fact; voted th© way
the NAACP suggested* there would have been overwhelmingly
disproportionate* 1 believe» black representation®
Let me make just a brief response -fee Mr® Poliak's
point regarding the inadequacy of the record®
We made a motion for summary judgment below* and our
statement as to points, as to which there is r.o genuine issue*
appears at 259 in the record® The State respondents did not put
in any of those questions in issue® The NAACP put some of -them

71
in issue; but we think not those really that would disposs of
this ease „
We believe our motion, for summary judgment on the
undisputed facts should have and could have been granted.
It is simply not true that this record in its present posture
requires any remand for any further hearing; if those points
are read, and if the complaint and the State answer, which
appears in the Appendix, are. both. read.
And, finally, —
QUESTIONs

Was the motion for summary judgment as to

a permanent injunction?
MR. LEWIN:

Yes, Your Honor. We moved, on the basis

of the record made on the motion for preliminary injunction, w®
move thereafter for a summary judgment.
There was a response to it filed by the NAACP, none,
to my recollection, filed by the State.
motion for summary judgment.

The court denied the

We appealed.

We asked, as part

of our appeal, that the Court of Appeals grant our motion for
summary judgment.
The record is in posture, where we think we're entitled
to summary judgment, based on the undisputed testimony at that
hearing, where feh.sre was ample notice
that was called without notice.

it was not a hearing

I think there were several days.

Our witnesses testified, and they called no witnesses.
QUESTIONs So the posture in the Court of Appeals was

72

not simply appeal from a pr t iminary injunction, but, an appeal
from the denial of a permanent injunction?
MR. LEWXMs

It was a dismissal, an appeal from the

dismissal of the complaint»
QUESTIONS

MR. LEWINs

Righto

The cross-motion, the motion for dismissal

of the complaint wsis granted.
And, finally, I think the Solicitor General has very
much overstated our position by saying that we urged that the
Voting Rights Act be overruled, and that race be ignored.
We made no such argument, we simply — we said
clearly, as in employment cases, it’s proper :or a State to look
at race to decide what its apportionment has done.

It is not

proper to make race the criterion, which is rsally — and it's
clear from the legislative record, that was the standard that
was used here by the New York Legislature.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
