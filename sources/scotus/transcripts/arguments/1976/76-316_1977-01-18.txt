P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 76-316# Bates and 0'Steen against Arizona.
Mr. Canby, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. CANBY# JR.# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CANBY;

Mr. Chief Justice# may it pleas© the

Courts
This case is about two lawyers who advertised in
their local newspaper and were disciplined for it.

But# as

I intend to show# it’s also a case about the delivery of
legal services in the United States.
The question presented her® is whether a disciplinary
rule# Rule 2~101(B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility#
which is embodied in a rule of the Arizona Supreme Court#
violates the First Amendment or is invalid for conflict with
the Federal Antitrust laws.
The rule itself prohibits any attorney from
publicising himself or his partner in local newspapers#
among other things.

It is set forth at pages 3 and 4 of

our brief.
The facts which gave rise to this controversy
concern a very unusual law practice.

Mr. Bates and Mr. O'Steen#

upon graduation from law school# worked a couple of years for
—* about a year and a half for the Maricopa County Legal Aid

4

Society and than sat. ovt on iiteir owa to develop a very special
kind of practice, which they intended to aim at that group of
people who were above the pov©r^ line and not eligible for
legal services, but are below the level of affluence which the
regular users of the legal profession enjoy»
Consequently, they set up a firm which was organized

to do a business depending greatly on systems where the
attorneys set up forms of their own design, used paralegals
to a great extent, used automated equipment, and, most
important of all# charged very little profit for each case»
As a result# they were able to offer a fairly
narrow line of services which landed themselves to standardize**
felon# but they found a great deal of difficulty in getting the
word out and# in the course of a two-year period, their
practice did not thrive»

They wanted to make it thrive and

they wanted to produce the services, and they wanted to have
clients # so they put together an advertisement which appears
at page 409 of the printed Appendix# and they ran it in the
Arizona Republic# a newspaper of general circulation# at
Phoenix# Arizona.
This advertisement# among other tilings# advertised
"uncontested divorce# both spouses sign papers# $175 plus a
stated court filing f@®SI # "name change” for a stated fee#
uncc’ntested adoptions and bankruptcies for stated fees, and
an uncontested divorce where the attorneys would prepare all

5
the papers for a person, who was intent upon getting his own
divorce himself.
This was published and, as a result of it,
disciplinary proceedings were started by the State Bar of
Arizona*

Hearings were held, and the administrative committee

which first heard the case found that they had violated the
law*

They permitted a full record to b© mad©» but their

finding was simply that th© rule of the Arizona Suprema Court
had bean breached toy th® publication, and that the two
appellants her© should b© suspended from practice for six
months.
On appeal to the Board of Governors of th® State Bar
of Arizona, this was modified to a week’s suspension for each,
and whan it went to the Supreme Court of Arizona, that, "was
changed to a censure, but & finding that they had violated the
canon was upheld and a censure was ordered by the Supreme
Court of Arizona*
Th© Supreme Court, in their opinion, specifically
rejected the First Amendment claims and -to® antitrust claims,
which appellants her® had asserted.
How, & restraint on this kind of advertising, of
course, strikes appellante as a severe interference, a classic
interference! with th© communication of information to their
clients * And# as I say, their clients were ones who are
perhaps th© great middle mass, by and large, of the popula-

6

felon.
QUESTION;
MR. CANBY;

Do you mean clients, Mr. Canby, or —
Pardon?

Potential clients.

QUESTION;

You mean clients or potential clients?

MR. CANBY;

Potential clients, Mr. Chief Justice.

And I might add that -the American Bar Foundation
study, the Curran and Spalding study, 'which is cited in our
brief, indicates 'that one-third of all the adult Americans
never use a lawyer in their lifetime, another third do so
one®, and it also indicatas that a great number of people in
the United States don’t knew how to find a lawyer, they don’t
have regular contacts with lawyers, and they also don’t have
a very good idea, many of them, of what lawyers charge for
their services.
And, in fact, a good portion of them tend to over­
estimate ‘the cost of lawyer services.
QUESTION;
means type of client.

Mr. Canby, you’ve emphasised the modest
The firm was also in the business of

representing plaintiffs in personal injury cases.

Did they

draw any line with respect to the economic status of that type
of client?
MR. CANBY;

No, Mr. Justice, and I has tan to add

that they did. not draw an economic line with- any client.

The

record indicates that the overwhelming majority of their
cliente range from the poverty level, practicallyv up to very

7
few with incomes over $25,000 a year per family.
But they do not hav© a policy of turning away people
who hav© greater income than that, for any case.
The first contention which w® assert here is that
-this provision violates the First Amendment.

And, of course,

osa the commercial speech doctrine, we rely very heavily on
Bigelow v„ Virginia, which upheld the First Amendment right to
advertise an abortion service? and we also rely, of course,
very heavily on the decision last term in Virginia State Board
of Pharmacy, which held that there was a First Amendment right
for drug price advertising*

That csis© being brought by

consumers who wanted to know drug prices*
But I submit that all of -the elements which the
Court found commanded First Amendment protection in Virginia
State Board of Pharmacy ar© present in tills case*

In other

words, the great public interest in the economic allocation
©£ resources, the importance of economic information, and
particularly price information to the consumer in making up
his decision as to whether or not to avail himself of legal
services, and what attorney to get, are served by the kind
of ad that my clients ran*
QUESTION:

Mr* Canby, would they have a First

Amendment right to advertise th© quality of their services?
MR* CANBYs

I think they would if it’s not deceptive

and misleading, ane, I believe that

8
QUESTION:

Well, for example-, in the personal injury

phase of it, would -they have a right to give a list of the
recent verdicts they just recovered?
MR» CANBY:

I think that the bar*, Mr. Justice

Sfceven3, could regulate in ways that the Federal Trade
Cononission sometimes r@gula.tes, to make a full disclosure.
In other words, if they

gave ten recent recoveries that were

very high, this, it seems to me, could be misleading if it
gave a false idea of their practice, or it might even be
argued that it overstates the role of th© attorneys in getting
those j udgments.
QUESTIONS

Wall, assume it's completely factual2

the last 20 cases we tried had th© following results

%

9 of

them war© settled, 4 of them w© lost, and in 7 of them we got
$200,000 verdicts.
MR. CANBY:

I to ink to ere would be a First

Amendment right to make that kind of an advertisement, assuming
that to© last 20 cases wasn't the beginning of a run of good
luck.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Was typical, yes. Assuming —
Well-, Mr. Canby, toe only thing this case

involves is toe total and complete ban on advertising.
MR. CANBY:
QUESTION:
MR. CANBY:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice ~
That’s all we have, here now.
That is correct, and no advertising by

9
an individual attorney in a newspaper is permitted in Arizona,
or, indeed, in -die classified section»
QUESTION; And you do not take the position that it
cannot be regulated?
MR» CANBY;

I do not.

In fact, I am sure that false

and misleading advertising can be regulated»
QUESTION;

I am also —

You are suggesting, I take it, that tney

could advertise that they got a $200,000 verdict, that that
would be protected by the First Amendment?
MR» CANBY;

I think that there's a danger of under-

disclosure in that, Mr» Chief Justice, and I think that the
bar could reasonably regulate to require full disclosure of
facts like that»

I think occasionally a single fact that's

advertised could be misleading, even if technically accurate»
QUESTION;

Let’s test out this First Amendment —

the scope of your view — your view of 'the scope of the First
Amendment protection.

Could they, in describing in an ad the

settlement for $200,000, document it with a copy of the check,
the settlement check?
MR» CANBY;

Her© again, Mr. Chief Justice, in my

opinion they could, if it were not misleading in other ways.
But, of course, no on© has to go that far to rule that the ad
which the appellants put in the newspaper is protected by the
first Amendment.
QUESTION s

Well, in a cas© where there is what is

10

regarded by senna m an opening wedge, don’ t you 'think these
are appropriate areas to explore?
MR. CANBY:

Undoubtedly they are.

And that’s why

I say I think that a good deal more advertising# and a good
variety of it would be entitled to First Amendment protection*
There are others who do not go that far# but 1 do.
QUESTION:

Mr* Canby# in endeavoring to have some

conception of the scop© of the First Amendment right that you
are asserting# you've been asked questions about the type of
advertisements# would there be any limitations as to the means#
xteafc about -television# for example?
MR* CANBY:
would be protected.

I think that television advertising
It seems to m© that the tests of

Virginia State Board of Pharmacy are:
gat information to tee consumer?

Does this serve to

Is fchete a First Amendment

right to convey this information?
And television# particularly with a certain segment
of tee population# would be a very good way to gat the
availability of certain legal services mad© known to the
population.
QUESTION:

It is often said in our profession teat

the best place to reach prospective personal injury plaintiffs
is in the hospital.

What would yon think of# say# handbills

that had the information you said a little while ago would be
protected by the First Amendment# that is the number of

11
successful verdicts and. the average size of verdicts,being
handed out in the Emergency Room of every public hospital?
MR. CANBY;

l think that is purely prohibitable.

QUESTIONS Why?
MR. CANBY;

it seems to me there is a time,, place

and manner regulation that could be made here, and it could b©
based on a high interest in protecting people who are in
various stages of physical disarray,really, from being
importuned by advertisements.

I think it's important to get

information to people, but I don't think that hospital
emergency rooms, scene of the accidents, is the placei and
if the bar prohibited that but let general public advertising
go, it seems to me that kind of a narrow regulation could be
permitfced.
QUESTION;

Yea, but you wouldn't say the State could

prohibit a candidate for office from canvassing in a

hospital,

just because the people might not b© in th© best possible
shape, would you?
MR. CANBYs
QUESTION s

Correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Was this because you think the protection

accorded to 'this type of speech is less than that accorded
to political speech?
MR. CANBY;

I think it is.

I think that the circula-

fcion of a commercial handbill is entitled, certainly, to less
protection than First Amendment speech of a political nature.

12

But I — and I would not assume the sauna test.
For instance, false and deceptive political speech
is obviously not prohibitable, but
[Laughter.3
MR, CANBY:

I do think fhowever, that false and

deceptive advertising should be, and that it is not protected
by the First Amendment,
QUESTIONj

Wall, last term's cas© said as much,

MR, CANBY;

Yes, it did,

didn* t it?
I don’t think that the —

and that, of course, and your concern established clearly —
QUESTION;
MR, CANBY;

That is Vi.rglnla Pharmacy.

Beg pardon?

Yes, That was clearly stated in more

than on© of the opinions in that case, that because of the
likelihood that commercial speech won't b© killed, and the
fact that the facte are really within the peculiar knowledge
of the advertiser, that probably some different rules can be
made on falsa and misleading advertising regulations, one of
them,
I -think it’s important to add in this case, too,
that the practice of influenc® does serve consumers, and it
seems teat it serves them in obtaining what really is a
constitutional right.

I think there is a constitutional

right to legal servicesf and extending the access to legal
services is really a wav of saying that the constitutional

13
rights of the recipients will accord with th® constitutional
rights of th§s would-b© commercial speakers in -this case.
QUESTIONz Are you suggesting that the function of a
pharmacist is to b© equated with the function of a physician
or a lawyer?
MR. CANBY:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

physicians and lawyers clearly have a much greater variety of
services ..they dispense. There is a great deal more judgment
involved, but th© American Medical Association, for instance,
has taken a position contrary to the State of Arizona here.
The Governing Council of th© American Medical Association,
this year, held that physicians can advertise fees for
specific services.

And that ruling is set out in the Appendix

to their amicus brief, the American Medical Association.
In other words, they do not see it as inconsistent
with professionalism of the most discretionary sort, to
advertise a set fee for a set service.

And, in fact, set

fees are even permitted by th© American Bar Association.

In

its 1975 amendments it authorized attorneys to advertise in
th® classified pagas that a list of fees, a written list of
fees is available on request.
Well, if an attorney can make up a written list of
fees, and give it to people who see reference to it in an
advertisement, I see no reason why that written list can’t
simply be advertised and it makes the consumer have that

14

information at much greater ease.

But the sat fee is still

there, and it’s written down and it’s chosen by the attorney.
On the si da of the state in the First Amendment
question, there is really here quit© a burden to b© sustained.
I think that Bigelow and the State Board of Pharmacy are clear
that there is a very high State interest required, that the.
First Amendment, sine® 'the protection does extend to commercial
speech, the First Amendment tilts in favor of publication,
the State really ought to show interest which justifies the
prohibition of all of this information.
The first justification which is heavily urged by
the appellee in this case is that this is really a form of
barratry, 'that if advertisements are widespread, then people,
who would not have availed -themselves of legal services, will
do so.

And if that’s the definition of barratry, than we

simply have to face that and say we*re guilty.
Because ignorance is not a very good way to control
who uses the legal system.

And to say that those who know

they have causes of action or those who know they need wills
or those who know they need divorces can get them, but those
who'don’t know this can't., and that that's the way we control
the flow of litigation or the use of legal services.
QUESTION:

But haven't bar associations, as such,

for many, many years, issued free brochures explaining the
title problem, and explaining joint tenancy, explaining the

15

problems of acquiring and financing the purchase of a bom®,
issuing them in public places without directing anyone to a
particular lawyer,- but merely acquainting the public with
these kinds of services?
MR» CANBYs They have —
QUESTION: That’s been vary common, hasn’t it?
MR* CANBYs

They have* and you’re right# Mr» Chief

Justice# this has been going on for several years; but the
great, need is still there. The studies# the preliminary
report is a couple of years old and the final report of this
legal needs of -die public survey is due for publication by
the American Bar Foundation this coming February# next month#
and it indicates that the people really aren’t being reached
by this information# and they are certainly not being reached
by price information.

People don’t know what this costs# and

it’s ' very burdensome to find out what it costs# and whan you
find out what a lawyer that you have gone to is going to
charge# there’s no way of telling what other lawyers charge
for anything like this service.
QUESTION:

Have not these same bar associations#

usually the State and local as distinguished from the American
Bar# published recommended schedules of fees# not binding as
in the Goldfarb case# but merely communicating to the public
that the examination of a title has a certain range, that
probate of an ©state has a certain figure# preparing a dead or

16

a will, st cetera?
MR. CANBY:

There is no evidence in the record qf

this, and 1 don’t know if it’s being done in Arizona, it may
wall have bean done elsewhere, I just can't answer the
question,

I don’t know.
It seems to me there might be antitrust problems

wife those fees if there is ~~ if it’s used as a means of
agreeing on fees to be charged.

But, to my knowledge, at

least in the record in this c&8€s, there’s no indication this
has been don®,
I think the reason that these institutional efforts,
although they are vary helpful, really haven’t succeeded are
two;

On® is that they do not permit enough information to be

conveyed? and, second, it’s a limited effort because it’s
really not directly in the economic interest of those
disseminating the information to disseminat® it,
.tod because of that the efforts don't work as well
as they do when the parson who is disseminating has a personal
interest: in getting the message across.
Another argument that's used by the State, although
I should say before I bring this ona up that we’r© talking
here about: the State interests- which might support this kind
of a regulation, we’re not talking about anything in this
record, really, because the appellants were charged not with
deceptive advertising or not with poor quality of services or

17
anything ©Isa ©is®, they were charged with advertising.
And the findings all along the way simply said they
advertised their disciplines.
So we* re really simply anticipating arguments the
State might male© for a constitutional rule justifying this
kind of an overbroad total ban, and we submit that its.
overbreadth itself is enough to strike it down.
This, in our — excuse me?
QUESTION:

Mr, Canbv, you said a moment ago that

you thought perhaps there was some difference in the protection
accorded to commercial speech than to traditional political
speech.

Do you think the doctrine of overbraadth would

apply with all its fore® in the area of commercial speech
th© way it does with ideological or political speech?
MR. CANBYs

I think that it would, because, largely,

when you say all its fora®, perhaps there are instances when
it wouldn’t.

It seems to ms when it is just speech, in other

words, th© publication of something in th© paper, overbreadth
is appropriate, and, indeed, a great part of th© opinion in
Bigelgfo v. Virginia was that overbreadth when it’s the pur©
transmission of a message is quite appropriate an approach
here, even though it is strong medicine.
This ban, for instance, does not permit th© kind
©f thing that th© ABA has said is permissible, setting up a
display box in th© classified pages, giving th® fee for

18

initial consultation, the ABA has permitted this in its
amendments, which are in the Appendix ait 449, and the
morning press tails me that the Michigan Court has adopted
this. But Arizona does not.

it seems to ms that’s an example

of overbreadth.
But we would also foe quite content, Mr. Justice
Rahnquist,

to stand on the ad here.

We think that this ad

is protected, and we are very anxious to establish that th©
advertisement of a fee for a particular service, which is in
fact held to and performed competently, is not deceptive, and
in fact it’s very helpful to the consumer to have that
i n f© ttnati on,
Th© arguments that professionalism is simply
inconsistent with advertising might have been easily accepted
several years ago, but there simply is too much advertising
don© now, or there are too many organizations which ar©
willing to endorse it, to entertain the idea that somehow
th© profession simply cannot operate with advertising.
QUESTION2

Well, the trend, though, in the legal

profession has been just th© -*<- in th® opposite direction,
hasn’t it?
MR, CANBYj

Th® on© century trend certainly has.

There was advertising -»
QUESTION; B@ca.tase 100 years ago lawyers did
advertise, didn't they?

19
MRa CANBY:

That's correct»

QUESTION3 Routinely, or

standard operating

procedure.
MR» CANBYi

Y©s. And, in fact, the first Code of

Ethics of any bar association in tills country, fch© Alabama
Bar in the 1880's, specifically stated that newspaper
advertisements were proper.
And it was subsequently, after the American Bar
Association was organized after the turn of the century, they
began to restrict this.
QUESTION;

Mr. Canby, does Arizona have an

integrated bar?
MR. CANBYs

It does, yes.

QUESTION; Every lawyer is a member of the bar there?
MR, CANBY3

That is correct, Your Honor.

It's interesting that even the seat of the
profession seems to be changing, too.

The monopolies commission

in England has recommanded -that solicitors be permitted to
advertise, and action is being taken on that recommendation.
The Governors of the D. C, Bar Association, here
in the District of Columbia, have recommended advertising which
would permit price advertising by individual attorneys.
That has not yet -«* in fact, it was just recently submitted
to the District of Columbia Courts. There’s been no action on
'that

20
In summary of the First Amendment problems, I think
that all of the arguments of the State really depend on the
public’s not knowing something, and tills rims afoul of the
Virginia State Board of Pharmacy strictures that protecting the
public by keeping it in ignorance really is not the way of the
First Amendment.
The question, it seems to me, that has to be asked
in this case is; What, is it in this ad that the consumers or
the public really ought not to know?
Apparently it would be all right to put it in a
written list, and there is evidence in the record that when
people telephone attorneys, the attorneys "set fees" for
things like uncontasted divorces.

Well, if that can be

told to a person when he calls, what is it about the
advertisement that means that the public shouldn't generally
be told that without having to call and compare?
QUESTION;

Would you think it would advance;

professionalism if vour clients having the ad which they used,
then another group ©£ lawyers would publish an ad of ten
percent less?
MRc CANBY;

I think it would, if they published ads

stating that —
QUESTION;

You think it would advance professional”

ism?
MR. CANBY;

I think it would.

Because I think the

21
greatest duty of the profession is to extend legal services
that does not have it/ and that legal services have regularly
been available, to a very restricted portion of the population.
And I think that this kind of thing would tend, for on© thing,
to —» and there’s economic expert testimony on this — -this
kind of advertising will tend to drive prices of legal services
down,
QUESTION;

Is there a reproduction of the ad as it

appeared in tha paper somewhere?
MR, CANBYs

At page 409 in the Appendix

409 in

tli® Appendix, Mr, Justice,
Ifd like to say a few words here about the antitrust
portion of this argument.
QUESTION; Before you do that, Mr. Canby, -—
MR. CANBYs
QUESTION;

Yes?
—- would you till us which issue you

•think we should decide first of the two.

The government has

a different view than the litigants, apparently,
MR, CANBY;

Well, 'the normal rule, I suppose, of

this Court is that you decide statutory grounds and avoid
constitutional decisions when possible.
I think that in this case the First Amendment argu­
ment is admittedly simpler.

And 'there certainly are occasions

when this Court has decided a constitutional argument where
there is a clear violation of the Constitution without entering

22
the statutory grounds.
Incidentally, in the other drug price case, Tarry v.
State Board of-Pharmacy out in California, the three-judge
court did just that. There were bath First Amendment and
antitrust grounds set forth in that case. They decided the
First Amendment ground.

This was before the Virginia State

Board of Pharmacy case was decided here.
And then they said:

We simply won’t reach the anti­

trust issues.
The antitrust issues in -this case, of course, revolve
primarily around the State action so-called exemption of
Parker v. Brown, and here the Justice Department, whose support
we welcome, on the First Amendment, takes leave of us and
takes this position with some reluctances and I can understand
their reluctance, because, in the record in this case for
instance, other professions testified as to their practices.
The accountants, for instance, had a rule against
competitive bidding.

It was a rule of their national

association, and it became a rule of their State association,
and it became a rule of the State Board of Accountancy in
Arizona,

Ho competitive bidding.
This was abandoned at the national level, according

to the record, under threat of Justice Department action.
It was abandoned at the State level by the State Board when
our State Attorney General wrote an opinion to the Board that

23

it violated Stats and federal antitrust lews.
Other kinds of restraints are common, the architects,
for instance, who permit solicitation »— pemit solicitation,
but not price competition.
Well, these are restraints of trade, and they are
restraints of trade that regulated professions can easily
get incorporated into rules of the profession, and the
restraint is great, as it is in this case.
The Parker v. Brown, of course, dealt with an anti­
competitive raisin marketing scheme that was imposed by
legislative command of the State.

The evolution of Parker,

to which we believe this case — into which this case can be
fit, is that announced in C an tor y. Da t ro i t Edison, where this
Court said 'that the practice of furnishing free light bulbs by
a regulated utility violated the antitrust laws, even though
it was incorporated in a tariff which had been approved by the
State Utilities Commission, and the utility was not free under
State law to deviate from -that practice.
Now, in Cantor, — the Cantor case, of course, is
distinguishable in that the State was not the one which was
doing the enforcing, it was a suit against the private
utility.

Here we*re talcing the next step, basically, and

trying to prevent the enforcement of a restrictive trade
practice which the State has approved by adopting this rule,
which was clearly originated by the ABA, both its predecessor

24

and the present ons, and adopting it into a rule of the State
Supreme Court»
Th© language which , it seems to in© , the government is
overlooking in Cantor is that which deals with the fact — and
this was dealt with also in Goldfarb ~ that whether or not
the State is involved is a threshold question»

And if the

State is not involved, as this Court really didn't feel it
was in Goldfarb, then there is no immunity. But that’s the
threshold question, and of course the State is involved here,
the court's enforcing this.
after the threshold?

Well, then, what question comes

And that is, is this rule really

necessary -to make the regulatory system work?

How badly

does it interfere with th® system of free competition that
the Sherman Act has mandated?

And what interests of th©

State make this rule necessary and what ones don’t?
And in this case we submit that the same interests
which we find to be weak when they are measured as a First
Amendment part of the State’s balance are equally weak when
they’re measured in the antitrust balance.
Thera's no question here, of course, that this is
a restraint and that restraint of price advertising affects
th® price structure.

A more or less classic antitrust

restraint.
©i® fact that the Stata is enforcing it is not the
whole answer. For instance, the State was enforcing its own

25
rule basically, or at least a State rule, a State command
was involved in the s chwegmaan case,

The Schw@gma.nn case was

an attempt basically to invalidate the State non-signer law,
under the Pair Trad® Acts, and ifc succeeded?

the State

command was invalid because it conflicted with the command
of th@ Sherman Act.
In other words, it did not fall — that fair trade
practice did not fall within an exemption to th© Sherman Act
that Congress had created.
QUESTION: Well, has this ~~ have -the restrictions
however originated with th© State or with the bar?
MR. CANDY;

The restrictions here originated with

the American Bar Association,
QUESTION:

Well, they may have, but th© bar hasn’t

any choice any mors, does ifc?
MR, CANDYs They haven’t, but,I would submit, neither
did the utility in Cantor. They no longer had a choice,
QUESTION; Well, yes, but they did originally.

They

could have filed a new tariff.
MR, CANBYs

That’s true, —

QUESTIONS Well, th® State can't,

the bar can’t

here file som® new rules with the Supreme Court and automatically
be out from under these rules?
MR. CANDY; •

No, it certainly wouldn’t b© automatic.

QUESTION? Weil, then it's State prescribed, isn't it?

26

MR. CANBY:

It is State commanded*, that’s correct?

by the —
QUESTION; But in the Canicor case, once you filed you
had to do what you said yo'ti were going to do.
MRo CANBYs

That’s true.

QUESTIONS

But you had to live up to your own tariff,,

MR. CANBYs

I believe., though, that those tariffs —

QUESTION; But they could have discontinued the
tariffs.
MR0 CANBYs

I believe that technically that has to

be approved
QUESTION; Well- th© bar can't send a notice to the
Supreme Court here and say, by the way we’r© now discontinuing
•th© rules you published.
MR. CANBYs

No- they certainly can’t.

QUESTIONS Well, what would ba left of Parker if you —
MR. CANBYs

Well, there would be less left of

Parker, I think,
QUESTION;

Quite a bit. But what would, be left of

Parker?
MR. CANBYs Well, in the first place, where there is
a high State interest, and I think that the best example, I
v

suppose, of what would be left of Parker is the natural
monopoly which public utilities are an example of.

If the

State wants to regulate the price structure of attorneys, then,

27
fine, I think that if they decide, for instance, either to hire
the lawyers or to put the lawyers under the. State Corporation
Commission and regulate their rates, then there’s a very
considerable argument 'that the State has substituted interests
which restrain the accesses of monopoly from those which
otherwise are provided by the Sherman Act,
Here, of course, the State command frees lawyers from
a certain kind of price competition, but it does not exert any
real pressure on the lawyers to keep their rates downa
QUESTION;

Well, would you be making the same

argument if, say, the Legislature of Colorado suddenly reared
back and said there shall ba — passers a law and says, there
shall be no advertising, price advertising, or any other kind
of advertising by lawyers?
And the lawyers live up to it as a, group,
MR. CANBY;

I think that would violate the Sherman Act,

but I must say that that's a much weaker case, because there
at least the political arm of the State has presumably
considered the matter and —
QUESTION;

Well, how would you —- even if Parker

wasn’t available, how would you prove a Sherman Act violation,
if lawyers just obeyed that law?
MR. CANBY; Well, that’s —
QUESTION; They don’t agree to anything, they just
live up to the law

MR. CANDY;

No.
Mr, Canby, instead of a defense# you are

in this case?
MR. CANBY;

If I were bringing an antitrust action#

I imagine that I would bring it against the State Bar.

But

it seems to n© it's a different
QUESTION; Could you get relief against the State
Bar ~
MR. CANBY;
QUESTION;

— it's a very different question,
— as long as fcha Supreme Court rule

remains in effect?
MR. CANBY; The State Bar might well be exempt from
as a matter of fairness — from damages# if it had no
option but to obey the law.
QUESTION; But supposing you got

you won your case

Bar and the Supreme Court: of Arizona said:

We don't care what happened in that litigation# we still have
this rule? we're going to disbar people who don't follow our
rule

29
Wouldn’t you have to name the members of the Supreme
Court in order to prevail?
MR* CANDY:

Well, perhaps, or at least if enforcement

was attempted, -then, to defend on that ground.

And it seems

to me if the Michigan Utilities Commission, the day after the
Cantor decision came down, said: All right, now we're holding
the utility to its tariff, because our State law says you have
■to be held to it.

Then I think the utility would have a

defense against that.
QUESTION:

Would the utility have a defense if the

tariff it proposed itself was unlawful?
MR. CANDY:

It seems to me the intervening decision

of this Court would provides that.

Otherwise, of course, this

Court and the Utilities Commission will be commanding
consistent conduct, and I would suggest that the supremacy
clause here simply dictates; that th© federal command prevail.
If I answered Mr. Justice White’s question -QUESTION; Well, don't be too quick to bring the

suit.
[Laughter. ]
MR. CANDY;

No. Right..

I will not.

In summary, I will simply say that, in our view, both
the antitrust laws and the First Amendment apply and a balancing
test applies.

The balance here in favor of public information

of this kind is tremendous, and the State’s interest, to the

30
contrary, are not.
The decision should be reversed.
I reserve any remaining time for .rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Canby.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
#

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
QUESTIONS

Mr. Friedman, before you commence, let

me share with you at least my primary concern with this case.
I think all lawyers agree 'that 'the problem being discussed
hare today is a very serious one, important for the public and
the profession.

The delivery of legal services in our

country obviously is defective.

The problem that I think

concerns all of us on this bench and at the bar is what to
do about it.
always.

Lawyers have advertised, to some extent,

Anybody who knows about Mar&indale can find out where

lawyers went to school, how old they are, and, until recently
at least, who their clients were.
They can also find out what areas of specialization
lawyers profess to be competent to practice.
I hope you have time to address, not just the bare
bones issue of whether or not. there can be any advertising --

31

I don’t perceive that as the basic issue in this case.

The

question is what limits, rationally, fairly, constitutionally,
may be imposed, who imposes those limits, and how are they
enforced.
These are the broader contours of the problem.

We

could decide -this case, and may very well do it, in a very
narrow way. But that wouldn't advance the resolution of the
fundamental problem.
MR. PRIEDMANs

Let ma address myself directly to that

question, Mr. Justice Powell.
I think we start with the basic issue that has been
suggested in -this case as a narrow one, whether there can be
an absolute ban on all advertising, and the position of -the
United States is that this absolute ban imposed, by the State
of Arizona goes beyond the permissible limits of the First
Amendment, it’s inconsistent with the First Amendment because
of the strong interest, of members of the public in getting
information about legal services, both their availability and
their cost.
Now, w® also of course recognize that there is a
very strong interest in insuring high ethical standards at the
bar.

As tills Court has indicated, both because of the

critical role that lawyers play in the administration of
justice, and their role as officers of the Court.

Obviously,

lawyers do not stand in exactly the same position as the

32
average merchant who is selling & standardized product,, he
is selling a special service.
But we think that the First Amendment requires that
any restraints that the State does impose upon the dissemina­
tion of information by lawyers to the public as potential
clients cannot go beyond what is necessary adequately to
protect the State's interest.
Now, that ultimate balancing in First Amendment
cases has to be drawn —- don© by the courts,

of course the

State has the power to prevent misleading, deceptive, false
advertising by lawyers.
than that.

And -the State has a broader authority

There may be many tilings that a merchant, can do

til at it is not proper for a lawyer to do, because it is
important, it is important to this country that the people of
tills country have a high regard for the legal profession,
because of its critical role in the administration of justice.
Bus we don't think that because of the importance
that the lay wars play in the legal system and in the operation
of our country that this means the bar can say there can be
no advertising at all.

We don't think the bar can go that far.

Now, there are problems, of course, of policing these
things. And I might just add in passing that we have indicated
in our brief that there’s some recent indications of sugges­
tions of what would be permissible.

We’re not espousing any

of these, all that we cite these for is to point out that the

33
problem is not to us an all-or-nothing problem, it isn’t
either there can be no advertising or that there’s got to be
enormous discretion.

There has to be some limitations.

How, one of the problems —
QUESTION:
there?

Hay I interrupt you just a minute right,

I think we start from the premise that some

advertising already is permitted, so the total ban issue, as
1 perceive it, is not hare.

You do have the extent of the

ban under the Arizona rule.
But Hr. Canby stated, quite explicitly, that he
thought the First Amendment entitled lawyers to talk about
the quality of their services.

What is the government’s

position on that?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, that, it seems to me, again
would depend on what is said.

If statements with respect to

the quality of services are misleading, the State can prohibit
■them.

I don’t think a lawyer could publish an ad saying

"Come to me, I’m a better lawyer than anyone else in town";
it seems to ne that’s not the kind of statement, although
permissible to a merchant, that a lawyer could properly state.
QUESTION: Well, suppose, in this case, a competing
lawyer had published an ad saying "The partners in this clinic
have been practicing divorce lav; on a part-time basis for fouryears ? I’m a specialist in divorce law, I've been practicing
it for twenty years, my fees are the same”; is that all right?

34

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I would think the derogatory thing

would present problems to ms,

I would think that it was

impermissible if the ad stated merely that "If you need a
divorce, we've bean practicing divorce lav/ for twenty years,
we are experts in"
QUESTION :

What's derogatory about that comparative

stafeement, if it's true?
MR. FRIEDMAN; Well, ife seems to me it is derogatory,
Mr. Chief Justice, because the suggestion is somehow that
“we are better than they are", and it's the negative suggestion
against them.

It seems to me this gets into the area where

I think that there may be problems with respect to what is
permissible.
QUESTION;

Well, does the First Amendment prohibit

derogatory communication?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

No.

It isn't — it isn't the

First Amendment prohibits derogatory communications, Mr.
Justice, we think it is that the First Amendment does permit
~ does permit — lawyers to get to the public their position,
that they are available to the public and indicating what
their services are and what they will charge for them.
Nov;, —
QUESTION;

What about simply saying "anything you

can do, I can do better”?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I don't think that would be permis-

35
s ib le, Hr. Jus ti ce.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Why?

Why not?

If the First Amendment compels the

inclusion that you suggest, then what —- where do these limits
come from, then?
MR. FRIEDMANS
QUESTION:

I think the limits cone —

They certainly don't come from the

First Amendment.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

No, they —

Where do they con© from?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The limits come, I think, Mr. Justice,

from the role of the lawyers and the differences?, the kind of
differences that exist with respect to what is an appropriate
kind of regulation of ‘the legal profession.
QUESTION:

Since when, under the First Amendment,

is a governmental body, whether it be a judicial, executive
or a legislative, allowed to say — to regulate speech?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it's not regulating speech in
that sense. What it is saying is that there's certain kinds
of speech, certain kinds of speech, certain kinds of things
done by lawyers that are not consistent with the

standards

that we accept of lawyers.
If I may give a simple example, I suppose there's
no question under th@ First Amendment that a merchant can put
out the most far-reaching and -die most sweeping claims for his

36

stuff, "Cone to our store, the best store in town, don't
buy — patronize anyone else"? that kind of thing.
QUESTION; Well, there's been no question for some~
thing less than a year.

A year ago there would have been a

great question whether a merchant had any First Amendment
right at all to do that.
MR. FRIEDMAN; That, I think now, has to be accepted
that there is — there is a First Amendment protection to
comma rci al s pee ch.
But the fact that there is a commercial speech
protection under the First Amendment doesn’t necessarily mean,
as this Court itself has suggested in those cases, that when
you are dealing with members of the profession, that
necessarily there has to be the

same sweep to the protection

they have, as is to be given to the common garden variety a?
commercial speech.

That is, the things that can be said about

advertising prescription drugs are not necessarily the same
things that can be said when a lawyer brings his message
to th© public.
QUESTION;

Quite obviously.

But I wonder where —

I can understand -- this is a Court that decides questions of
federal constitutional or statutory law, the issue her© is
whether or net the First Amendment of th© United States
Constitution requires Arizona to do something else than it
did.

And if it does, then it requires Arizona to allow

37
lawyers to advertise.
But now, where do all these limitations come from
in federal law, constitutional or
MR. FRIEDMAN:

statutory?

Well, I think it comes in, Mr.

Justice, in the balancing process, in determining ~ in
determining just how far the State can go in respect —
QUESTION:

Do you think it's up to us to say that?

Where does our power come from?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, in the first instance

in the

first instance it has to be the State that makes the judgment,
and the State in this case has not made any judgment other
than the judgment that there shall be no advertising at all
by lawyers in the State of Arizona, and that’s what we think
is bad, this absolute ban.
Nov?, if the Court agrees with us that the absolute
ban is bad, that doesn’t mean that you have to go all the way
and say that there can be absolutely no limits at all.
QUESTION:

Arizona, as my brother Powell has

pointed out, doesn’t really mean what it has said, does it?
It doesn't ban the circulation of Martindale-Hubbell in the
State of Arizona, does it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

But what they really — what they

are really talking about, it seems to me, is advertising
directed to the public.

Martindale-Hubbell is basically, I

think, directed to members of the bar.

I think what Arizona

38

does do is bar say advertising by lawyers to fcha public.
Anything that die lawyers do that, gets fco die public, the
lawyer’s position, making and. announcing the availability of
their services and indicating the costs at which they will
furnish them.
I think
QUESTION:

What is the thought to federal

constitutionalize it that says Arizona can’t do what it did,
but another State could prohibit derogatory advertising by
one ■ lawyer about another?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think so.

QUESTION:

But where does that come from?

QUESTION;

Where does it com© from?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Well, I think it comes from the

recognition ■— it comes from the recognition that die First
Amendment protection given to commercial advertising by
lawyers is not necessarily to have the full force and effect
as fch© First Amendment protection given fco advertising by
merchants.

That it’s protected, it is protected by the

First. Amendment, but the scope of the protection isn't as
sweeping as the protection given fco the more traditional
kinds of coronarcia 1
QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, are you not suggesting a

distinction based squarely on the content of the advertising?
The content of the speech?

39

MR, FRIEDMAN;

Yes, I think I am, Mr. Justice, and

I fchink the Court: last year in the American Mini Theatres case
recognized that there may be situations in which you can refer
to the content of the speech.
QUESTIONs Well, would you agree that your position
must fail unless the Court is willing to say that the content
may be the basis for differentiating between 'the kinds of
protected speech and unprotected speech?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I — no, Mr. Justice White,

there have — there are situations, it seems to me very
clearly, where the content of the speech does control the
measure to which it can be regulated.

In the. field of

commercial advertising, the Court pointed out last year that
while ifc was a First Amendment right to distribute and announce
the prices at which prescription drugs were being sold, ifc
didn't follow from that there was a First Amendment right to
make false and misleading statements.
So it seems to m© the Court does look to see what
the content is, if it’s false and misleading, certainly the
maker of these statements cannot claim that it’s constitutionally
protected.

I think
QUESTIONs But it seems to me that you’re taking two

different positions.

One time you say —- you and Mr. Canby

both kept saying, well you can prohibit false and misleading.
But Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked you about derogatory.

It can

40

be truthfully derogatory.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

Well, —
Your only line surely is not the false

and misleading line, is it?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
what beyond that.

No. Well, it nay — no, it goes some­

I don't know precisely at what point the

line has to be drawn.

That, it seems to me, is a line that

in the first instance has to be drawn by the State, because
the State has the broad regulatory authority over -the legal
profession.
QUESTION;

You gave an example earlier about the

merchant puffing, in effect, saying he's the best in town,
or something like that.
Are you suggesting that that could be prohibited?
for example, could the State say that a lawyer may not
advertise that his fees are "vary reasonable”?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

I —

Which is precisely what -this person did.

MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, this person merely stated
"reasonable fee".
QUESTION;

No, "very reasonable".

MR. FRIEDMAN;

"Very reasonable fees", "very

reasonable fees”.
QUESTION:

Is that permissible under your view?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I would think that kind of a statement

41
is permissible»
QUESTION: So, some statement of opinion about ~
MR» FRIEDfiAN:
QUESTION:

Some statement, yes.

Other than the mere fact —

MR. FRIEDMANs But again I think it has to take into
account th© whole matrix of the relationship of the bar to the
public. That is, there are certain -things, it seems to me, that
the State fairly can conclude are not properly to b© done by
members of the bar. They could be done by non-professionals.
QUESTION: And one of them may be to advertise, at
all?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTIONS

Well, it —

If what you say is correct.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's where we disagree, Mr. --

QUESTION: Well, where do these limitations come
from?

They either have a First Amendment right to do this,

short of defrauding people or being deceptive or false, or
they don't.
MR. FRIEDMANS

Well, I —

QUESTION: And where in the Constitution or the federal
law, th© Federal Constitution, or may federal statute, do
these limitations com® from?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think these limitations derive,

Mr. Justice, from th© nature of the legal profession, and from
the fact -that traditionally, in evaluating First Amendment

42
rights, there has to be this balancing test. And when you
consider a limitation on all advertising, as distinguished
from the limitation on certain types of advertising, it seems
to me the State's interest in restricting certain forms of
advertising nay be much, much greater than -the State's
interest in —
QUESTION:

And it occurs to me that what you’re

proposing is a considerably more arbitrary standard than the
one that Arizona has adopted.,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t —

QUESTION: Where, anywhere, has there been — once
it has been recognized that there is a First Amendment to
speak or to write, where, anywhere, has there ever been
found any permissible limitation upon it, so long as it's
true?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But I think, Mr. Justice, I would

sugges that
QUESTION: Where?

I would like to have an answer

to tiiat question.
MR. FRIEDMAN; Well, let me see if I can answer it
this way, that in determining what the First Amendment right
is, when w© say there's a First Amendment right to advertise,
■that doesn't mean a First Amendment right to advertise any
conceivable thing, and I —QUESTION:

There's not a First Amendment right to

43
speak the truth? —

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION?

No, but there is, fir. —

— since when?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There is a First Amendment right,

of course, to speak the truth.
QUESTION:

All right.

But -Then why can you have any

limitations if you're correct about the First Amendment
requiring that, where does any limitation come from that
allows any governmental agency, executive, legislative or
judicial, to impose any limitations on lawyers* right to
speak the truth when they advertise, including saying "I have
been practicing divorce law for twenty years and am the most
experienced divorce lawyer in -this community”?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think the — the latter, it

seems to me, I'd think they could say.

I think they could

s ay the latter.
QUESTION:

"And her© are my fees, and they ate no

higher than any other lawyer in town"»
MR. FRIEDMAN:
up to that point, yes.

I think that up to that point, yes?
But at some point, it seems to me,

they may go beyond this, because at some point they are
likely to say things that seemingly are wholly factual, but
in fact may not b@ that factual.
QUESTION:

If one --

Let me try balancing on that score with

you, since you mentioned the balancing process.

44

Suppose this lawyer or law office has advertised
wills for $25, and -then they put, along with the supermarket
ads, an ad of their own thing, ”$25 wills, Saturday only,
$14.95";

do you think they could do that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think ~ I- would think, if

they were prepared —~ if they were prepared for any client,
who came in on Saturday to draw a will for $14.95, although
$25 is the regular price, they could state -that.
QUESTION: But does anybody know what a $25 will is,
in tii© first place?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, there may be something —

there may be something deceptive if, in fact, they never
draw wills for $25.

But if they say a simple will --

"Simple will, $25" and in fact they are drawing wills for
people for $25, it seems to me they could state that. And I
think they could also state that on Saturdays, a special for
the man who is working five days a week and can’t come to
see us during the week, $14.95.

I think they could say

that as long as it’s truthful, as long as it's truthful.
If, in fact, when people came in for their $25
wills or their $14.95 wills, they quickly told them: Well,
your will is much more complicated, it's going to cost you
$150.

That would seem to me to be misleading in the classical

traditional sense.
But 1 don’t think they can be stopped from telling -

45
QUESTIO??;

Well, that's just a bait-and-switch

trick, that's — we're not talking about that®
[Laughter® 3
QUESTIONt

We're talking about -- well, you go

ahead®
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If I may, Mr® Chief Justice and

members of the Court, 13 cl just like very briefly to speak
about the Fark®r v. Brown point, which has been discussed
briefly here.
It seems to us that what the cases in this Court,
starting with Parker v® Brown and going through Cantor,
establishes one fundamental principles

that if the action

challenges a violation of the antitrust laws is, in fact,
action of the State or compelled by the State, it's State
action not subject to th© strictures -of the antitrust lav/s®
Now, in this case, unlike -the Virginia, case, where
all that happened with regard to th® fee schedules was that
Si© State approved them or suggested them or authorized them,
here the State commands it®
Arizona®

It’s a rule of the State Bar of

Th© State — I'm sorry, the State Supreme Court of

Arizona.
And if I may just complete, Mr® Chief Justice, the
State Supreme Court is the one that exercises the function
of the State of Arizona in dealing with lawyer discipline®
This is not a case where fee bar association suggests some-

\

46

thing and the State Supreme Court says "If you want to do it,
go ahead and do it" .

Here, as has been brought out, it’s the

State Supreme Court, 'Idle final arbiter on these matters,
that has ordered the lawyers in Arizona not to advertise*
Itss the State Supreme Court that has disciplined these
lawyers for advertising*
The State is speaking, in this matter, through the
only agency by which it functions with respect to disciplining
of lawyers, and that, it seems to us, is State action under
any standard of the term, and is therefore not a violation
of the Sherman Act*
Thank you*

AFTERNOON SESSION

[1:01 p,wj
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Frank,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. FRANK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, FRANK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
From Mr. Canby and the amici government, I draw a
certain common syllogism.

The major premise is that not enough

people receive legal services.

The minor premise is that

solicitation by advertising will greatly aid the deprived.
The conclusion is that the First Amendment of the
Federal Constitution requires that advertising be permitted.
In response to this, my own single greatest
obligation from all of the sources on which we have drawn is
to Mr. Frederick Ballard of the bar of tills city, who, almost,
Mr. Justice Powell, in response to your comment, in making a
speech of his own on this subject, directed me to a singularly
©posic aphorism by II. L. Mencken, which I repeat:
"For every serious problem there is a solution which
is simple, direct, and wrong.*
Well, we acknowledge the sincerity of those who,
with Biblical fervor, contemplate the vision of striking
the rock and having a stream of pure water come out to slake
the thirst of the multitude.

We frankly find it astonishing

48
that they can be so blind to the cataclysmic flood which
they seek to unleash»
What you are asked fco believe is that if you give
your permission, the nation will be dotted with noble souls,
who will, by advertising, communicate to those otherwise
unaware their desire to perform worthwhile and needed service
at very low cost,
This frankly visionary speculation overlooks the
human experience which tells us that you would h@ unleashing
quite a different flood.

The plain truth of the matter is

that advertising law business leads to incompetence at best»
And th© experience of the Patent Office which tried it, and,
after full hearing, concluded in formal opinion that this was
exactly true, is good documentation»
But, fco put it bluntly, it leads to lying, cheating
and swindling at its worst»
We don't, have to guess about this, we know»

We

know because, as Justice Stewart reminded us this morning,
there was no limitation on advertising in th® Nineteenth
Century, and what I am talking about is exactly what happened»
The only notes we have of an oral argument that
was aver mad© by Abraham Lincoln at the trial court involved
th/3 case of a widow of a. Revolutionary War veterari» who was
represented by what was then called a claims agent, who was
permitted to get his business by solicitation. And he was

49
doing what would in our own time be regarded as legal work.
Lincoln took the widow's case without charge,, to
try to recover same of what that agent had kept, and perhaps
some of you have seen the notes of that argument and can
imagine th© immense force of the underlying phrase at the
end of it, which says;

Skin the defendant.

It isn’t any wonder that Lincoln told the law
students;

"Never stir up litigation,

A worse man can

scarcely be found than one who does this, A moral tone ought
[sic]
to be infused into the profession which would drive such men
out of it,"
Now, I want to make very clear that for those of us
who uphold the ban on solicitation, we do not regard this as
the pieties of the dead to which we are somehow paying
lip service.
The other side says in its brief that what a
different era called runners and cappers are quaint
anachronisms which don’t need to concern us any more.
We don't see it that way.
We say that the lawyer who directly or through his
intermediary goes to the hospital to line up the injured to
sue is unworthy of the profession and, in Mr, Lincoln’s phrase,
"ought to be driven out of itw,
Mr, Canhy says that, he would like to see controls
on that score, but his clients said at trial, in response to

50
tiie questions

"Do you believe you have the same First

Amendment right to go to the hospital* or give your cards at
the scene of the accident?” was* after some waffling* "I think
that it may well be true 'that* if tested, a lawyer has a
constitutional right to engage in that solicitation»"
Mo lawyer of integrity ~ I put it this strongly —*
no lawyer of integrity can read our recitation of what
actually happens with actual solicitation — we took the cases
from California as an example —* frankly without his stomach
turning»
Even when our guard is all the way up* there are
persons who solicit the widow end the orphan and the sick to
bring actions which are* first and foremost* intended to
line the pockets of those who represent them.
We say that 'this is abacs lute ly bad business.

We

take, as our contemporary champion* Chief Justi.ce Roger Tray nor *
who wisely said* speaking of -the very persons that our friends
here wish to help* the persons who are inexperienced*

who

don’t know about legal counsel* who are having their first
run at it? what Chief Justice Tray.nor said was:

"Clients

who need legal assistance only rarely and are therefore
inexperienced in

selecting counsel may be induced by

advertisement to select unsuitable counsel* with consequent
injury not only to themselves but to the reputation of the
bar as a whole

51
Now, the argument which you heard this morning, the
counter argument, is that all these evils, can be avoided by
permitting only honest advertising, and by controlling the
deceptive.
If there is one element of sanctimonious pap in this
whole case, that is it.
The argument fails for three reasons?
First, advertising to be gravely undesirable doesn't
have to be misleading.
morning.

There were examples mentioned this

Exuberant puffing of the raps beaten here or the

six $100,000 verdicts last year may be true, without being
very desirable.
Second, the hustle is peculiarly likely to push
people where 'they shouldn't go.

Mien there is no real

likelihood that they can appraise their own situation — a
matter to which I want to return.
But, ‘third, and the main point I would develop
now, the whole talk of controlling misleading advertising
by criminal or regulatory sanction is, itself, the biggest
hoax, the biggest misleading of all.
The plain truth is —» and I direct myself, Justice
Marshall, to the exchange you had about, are w@ talking only
about an absolute control -- what we are talking about is &
prohibition of legal advertising in newspapers in this case
by people who ar© trying to make money out of it.» And that is

52
prohibited in our state.
And I point this out* that in all of the briefs
you've had* Hr, Canby, the government, -the rest of them,
no one has ever yet told you how these controls are supposed
to function.

No one gives you more than the name or

invocation of honesty.

The grand-dad of all false professional

advertising, of course, is medicine.

The spellbinding patent

medicine vender with his snake-oil cures is a Nineteenth
Century legend, which we allowed to become amusing because it
is so remote.
We have created a Pood and Drug Administration which
works in a kind of a way, sluggishly and expensively, to
control the abuses of ’the national drug concerns, few in
number, which manufacture the bulk of -the products you spoke
about; in the prescription drug case.
But the only protection the public gets from mis­
leading advertising at the grss-roots level is the ethical
system of the doctors themselves.
I level a direct challenge to our adversaries heres
if you allow & general pattern of advertising — and what
you do here for lawyers you0 re going to do for accountants
and for doctors, they're in the same pot — if you allow this,
just exactly who is going to look at the hundreds of thousands
of ads which may come out?

All w© are doing is opening the gat®

Let 'er come*

Now, Justice Rehnquist, you raised in colloquy the
argument of overbreadth, which Justice Canby talked about?
the argument that the ban is too broad*
Chief Justice Hughes, than whom no more towering
devote© of free speech ever safe here, told us in the Samley
case -that society did not need to pick and choose which
professional ads are invidious and which are net*
This Court, in the recent. Mini Theatres case,
observed that in commercial speech the content of a particular
advertisement may determine the extent of its protection*
Chief Justice Hughes had something to say about
content*

He told us that professional advertising is what

it is, inherently misleading.

He expressly rejected the

concept that control of professional service advertising
/"A

must be as narrow as possible to fit only precis© abuses.
QUESTION:

What is inherently misleading about the

ad in this case, on page 409?
MR. FRANK:

This is a good example, Mr. Justice

Blackmun*
QUESTION:
MR. FRANK:

l*d like to have you point it out*
I5d like to b© specific about it.

The Supreme Court of .Arizona pointed out instances in which

54
even this ad, which is a little squib of an ad, meant; to be
a test case, and they make it as perfect as they can. So
they tell us, first of all, that this is a legal clinic, and
they somehow imply that there is something virtuous or cheaper
about it — virtuous or inexpensive.
But when we cross-examined them on the stand, there
is no conception of what a legal clinic is, it's a meaningless
term, simply a kind of an invocation of nothing.
More than that, they are offering, proposedly,
particularly economical services, particularly beneficial
prices.

Take, for example, the one of their consent

divorces.
They have also told us on this record that they
charge $40 an hour for their time.

They have told us on this

record that their divorces taken between an hour and a half
and three hours maximum,

And it is no wonder that the

Supreme Court of Arizona observed that this is outright
misleading on its face, this indication of some great
bargain for these so-called consent divorces.
The one on which there is -the greatest tone of
misleading, a matter to which I may come back, is to talk
about name changes; and that also was picked up by the
Supreme Court below.
The truth of the matter is that anybody in our town
who wants to can go in and get his name changed for nothing.

55

And you don't need legal services for this.
So the question of whether somehow this is a great
benefaction to mankind is highly doubtful»
QUESTION; What is it precisely that you feel is
misleading about the divorce at $175 plus $20 court filing?
MRo FRANK;

The point that is misleading is the

suggestion that somehow this is some kind of a grand public
service bargain»
QUESTION; Well, where do you get, that out of the
ad?

Are you saying that that is not a vary reasonable fee?
MR. FRANK;

I am saying that given the standards

of these people, who are purporting to < be entitled to
special dispensation because they are being so generous to
the lower middle class, that the answer is no, it's not.
QUESTION;

But that’s not in the ad, is it?

MR. FRANK;

It is when you connect it with the

notion of the legal clinic and the special service and that
somehow we are prised and special.
I agree, Mr. Justice Relinquish, that I can’t male®
this ad into a devastating falsehood.

It isn’t.

It’s

marginal.
i

The point that 1 want to make here —
QUESTION; Well, that was my initial question.
MR. FRANK:

Yes.

It is, and I am answering it as

hard and as solid as I know how

56
QUESTION:

It took you a little while to get there,

Mr„ Prank,
MR, FRANK;

All right.,

What 13m saying, Mr,

Jus'tic® Blackmun, is that the three i. terns , which we have
suggested in our brief, which we suggest are at least
marginally misleading are, No, 1, the suggestion that there
is something called a legal clinic.

On -the record, it is

apparent that this is an empty term, which somehow imputes
special value and special economy.
On

examination as to what the legal clinic is,

and there8s a full-scale record before you showing it, it
turns out that what a legal clinic does is what every office
in Phoenix does;

that they use paralegals, that they have

forms, and so on.
Secondly, the Supreme Court below broadly suggested,
and I think correctly, that the suggestion that this is somehow
a great bargain price for divorces is misleading, especially
measured by their own hourly rate and the time to at it takes
for tiiera to do it.
And finally, -QUESTION:

But they don't even say it's a bargain,

they just say it's reasonablec
MR. FRANK;

They say it's reasonable, but I think,

Mr, Justice White, —
QUESTION:

You’d better stay close to that mike, —

MR. FRANKs
QUESTION:

I'm sorry j thank you,
— if you want your imperishable words

recorded
MR. FRANK:

All right, posterity will not be let

down.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

[Laughter. 3
MR. FRANKS

Mr. Justice White, I think that it is

fair to say that the whole tone of tills advertisement, the
whole tone of the brief is that somehow we are doing something
very special for the community, we're being just great folks,
and we're giving you wonderful bargains.
Now, on the matter
QUESTION:

-

Mr. Frank, ~

MR. FRANK:

If I may conclude with the name change,

and then pick that up, sir.
On fch© name change point, what the attorney said,
when he was examined on the stand about the fact that you can
get those for nothing, you don't need to pay $95, is:

I feel

under no obligation to tell people that they can get services
cheaper somewhere else.
I submit that the tone of the thing is not quite
what is being presented to you here today, of some great
virtue and economy.
Mr. Justice Stevens?

58
QUESTION;

Hr® Prank, what Is the prevailing fee

in this community for an uncon tested divorce?
MR® FRANK %

The problem — let me answer by saying

first# —
QUESTION; Do you know?
MR. FRANK;

— that the difficulty arises because the

term ‘‘uncontested divorce” is & sliding term.
I would say that uncontested divorces could run#
depending on hew uncontested they really are# anywhere from
around $150 to around $300.

I've handled them myself for

anything in that whole zone, in the course of the years# from
time to time.
This is a low price# but it is not some spectacular
bargain.
QUESTION;

But judged by the standards of the

community# rather than their own hourly charge# it is a
reasonable fee# is it not?
MR. FRANKs

It is certainly a moderata fee.

QUESTION;

Then what is misleading about the

reference?
MR. PRANK; Well# again# I come back to the fact that
— and this is simply the bast I can do with it# Mr. Justice
Stevens — is that I think even in ‘this simple ad they are
trying to suggest some extra-special# and there isn’t anything
that extra-special here

59

In the Williamson v. Lee Optical case, -this Court,
in a unanimous opinion by Justice Douglas, which followed
Chief Justice Hughes" opinion in Semler, expressed, in dealing
with advertising which related to health, said that the
legislature was entitled to conclude that advertising could
be limited or even abolished in the public interest»
the Court said:

And

We see no constitutional reason why a State

may not treat all who deal with, the human eye as members of
a profession, who should use no merchandising methods for
obtaining customers»
We submit that it is plain false logic for the
other side to say that the Hughes opinion or the Cardoso
opinion -that preceded it, or the Douglas opinion that followed
it, somehow are all immaterial because they didn"t use the
precise words "free speech",
QUESTION: Well, Hr» Frank, what if the United
Mine Workers or the United Transportation Union published this
same ad, and at the bottom it said, "United Mine Workers
Legal Clinic", and then under it it gave the names of the
lawyers?

Otherwise published this same ad, and they just

circulated it -n their union newspaper, published it in their
union newspaper to all their members, or to anybody else who
wanted to buy it»
MR. FRANK:

Mr» Justice White, you have, in effect,

raised the question of the serias of cases which have come up

60

her©, which upheld group legal services and permitted
effective advertising communication to them.

And the answer

is that that wouldn't be a violation in the State

of Arizona

either.
The talk that you've been given today suggests that
somehow Arizona blacks out all kinds of communication. The
fact is that the rule of the Supreme Court, the one under
discussion about newspaper advertising is a particular rule,
there sire others, and there is an express rule — and I
understand it has been one of the very first ones — to permit
institutional advertising for legal services and institutional
advertising for. groups.
QUESTION: So you are saying that — you're saying
that something that you wouldn’t call a group legal service
exactly, but a union — well, your answer is that you would
not say that the Arizona rule would forbid this advertisement
published by a union?
MR, FRANK:

What I am saying, Your Honor,

being brief because of the exigency of time

I am

but if you will

look at our Rule 2“101, subparagraph 7, you will find *— I
hold it in my hand

that that kind of thing would be

al lowed.
What our State sees fit to bar is advertising by
individual lawyers in newspapers for the purpose of lining
their own pockets.

It expressly permits institutional

61

advertising and benefit of lawyer referral services, it
permits advertising for legal aid organizations, and it would
permit, certainly, the -anion to tell its people what the
services are which are part of the program»
These are matters of very subtle distinction which
our Supreme Court has seen fit fco make»

But our Supreme

Court has not seen fit to allow this kind of advertising of
the individual pocket-lining

variety.

QUESTION: Well, do you 'think the ad that I spoke
about, published by the union, would be constitutionally
protected under our cases or not?
MR. FRANKs

I am in doubt, frankly, I'd want to

give it tighter thought than I have.
QUESTION: Well, isn't that a ~
MR. FRANKs

I do think that it is permitted at

least under the rules which we have.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I just wonder what

your view was of the constitutional protection or not, for
an ad as I described.
MR, FRANK:

I am in doubt as to whether there is

constitutional protection.

I simply - as I say, I haven't

thought it through to my satisfaction.
But that is because I approach it from a different
standpoint.

I approach it in terms of who is to make these

decisions, a matter to which I will come? and the contending

62

circumstance here is that the Arizona Supreme Court has
determined fco do precisely that»
Now g we know that —
QUESTION:

I have to admit, Hr, Frank, 1 am puzzled

by your being willing to admit that "may" be constitutionally
protected, but this clearly may not be? and the only
distinction is that there’s pecuniary gain as the motivation
for the perrson that publishes here»
distinction?

Is that a constitutional

In First Amendment terms?

MR» FRANK:

As I say, in respect to the ads which,

are the ads for the group services where, for example, a
union wishes fco tell its members —
QUESTION:
MR» FRANK:

Well, precisely this ad by a union»
Yes, And the answer is that, for

example, you have on® of the briefs before you, it’s the
brief of the Arizona Credit Union League, and what the
Arizona Credit Union League says expressly is:

We don’t want

to be associated with the argument that Mr» Canby is making»
What they say is that it’s enough that we are
entitled fco tell our own members in some effective way about
the services which are available to our own members.

And

that, under fch© cases, I submit, is permitted and is accept­
able.
Where we are drawing the line for a lot of reasons,
which go fco the nature of professionalism, to which I come,

63

and which we briefed with determinationf is that there is
less onslaught and destruction of the profession by allowing
groups of that sort to communicate with their members about
services available than there is about the kind of thing the
Chief Justice talked about, having fee lawyer saying "I'll
give it to you for $19.95 on a hot Saturday afternoon.”
QUESTIONS Well, you wouldn't permit the Credit
Union to do that, would you?
MR. FRANK:

All we permit the Credit Union to do

is to inform -- first,to arrange for legal services, and,
second, to tell people that they're there.
I want to make clear that we are no more regressive
than our friends about the problem raised by Justic© Powell.
Of course, w© have to do the best we can to extend legal
services in th© United States, and we have to do a better job
than we'r® doing, and we’re trying? and that’s one of the ways
w© try.
But toe bludgeon of toe First Amendment, the main
point of the colloquy this morning with Justice Stewart,
is simply not a suitable tool or device for doing it.
Let me turn, if I may, to the concept of commercial
speech as being balanced against the community values of the
control of toat speech.
My own syllogism, unlike the other side’s, is:
legel profession is worth preserving.

toe

Its good vastly out™

64
weighs ite evil»
The minor premise is that commercialization is
incompatible with professionalism.

And the conclusion is.

therefore, the profession should avoid commercialization.
Now# I know I have to defend teat syllogism against
hard attack.

We all know that law offices are big businesses #

that they may have billion-dollar or million-do liar clients,
they're run with computers# and all tee rest.

And so the

argument may be made that to term them noncommercial is
sanctimonious humbug.
But my response# developed more fully in my brief
than I can here# is very much the response teat Plato made to
tee. same, argument 2#000 years ago.

Plato# in his dialogue

with Thrasymachus in tee Republic# makes two points which have
some real bearing here.

His first point is that because of

the degree of special knowledge involved# the professional
on the

one hand and his client on the other are# as he saw

it# almost like the ruler and his subjects were the fancy
words he used.

In everyday terras# this means teat professional

— the professional diagnoses the problem# and he makes his
recommendation.
While the client has some choice of rejection or
selection of alternative courses of action# he is basically
dependent on tee advice he receives.

In short# Plato saw a

profound difference between buying a pot and

obtaining a

65

remedy for a disease»

Just; as there is a profound difference

between going to the drug store and getting a bottle of
standard produced pills, and going to -the doctor and finding
out what one ought to do for his illness.
Now, -this,we developed again extensively in the
brief before you,

is developed by the sociologists as a

recognition that this condition still exists, and it puts
very serious problems of social control.
The plain truth is that laymen cannot judge the
professional performance in many cases,

Indeed, they may not

even be able to set the goals for the professional’s work.
And this means that the -two most common forms of
control of work in industrial society, either bureaucratic
supervision or customer judgment,

are of only limited

applicability to the professions.
At the same time there’s a need for social control,
and so we come to the ultimate question: Who is going to
exercise it?
Our adversaries wish it to be exercised by the
policemen or a legal equivalent of the Food and Drug Administra»
tion.
W@ want it exercised by the court, taking such
help as they need from the profession,
Now, Plato makes another point which is serious here.
I go into this, because if we are talking about professionalism

66
arid what this is going to do to the profession, -then w© need
to know what a profession is and what -this one is»
Plato says;
or a maker of money?"

"Is the physician a healer of tire sick
And his answer is that "no true

professional considers his own good in what he prescribes,
but, rather, the good of his patient, because the true
professional is not a mere money maker."
And this leads to to© related concept of -the
professional and service.

And that has lived with us for

2,000 years.
Roscoe Pound was no high priest of sanctimony, and
he gave us a firm reminder of the professional who performs
service for little or nothing.

He says, "This spirit of

public service in which the profession of lav? is or ought to
be exercised is a prerequisite of sound administration of
justice according to law."
This, I submit, is a key difference between
commercialization and professionalism.
QUESTION;

Mr. Frank, getting back to the present

time, if there is a person in Arizona who wants a divorce,
and he's & perfectly ordinary person, I want to compare him
with the well-educated, extremely wealthy person who has an
antitrust matter, he can use Martindale-IIubfoeJl to find out
all he wants.
MR. FRANK;

That’s right

67
QUESTIONs

Nov/,, the poor man who has -- he's got

195 bucks to get a divorce»

How would he go about finding

a lawyer in Arizona?
MR» FRANK s The first thing that he would do * Mr„
Justice Marshall, is go to the Legal Aid Society

and I am

able to testify to that, because I personally have served
there for a long -time, and so has my office — and h® would
come in there and he would very possibly get his divorce for
nothing»
But because of breakdown, because it doesn't move
fast enough to satisfy him and he wants it right now, he
will call the Lawyer Referral Service — we have in the room
today somebody from the ABA's Lawyer Referral Service# which
is doing the best it can to get names distributed —
QUESTION:

And how would the man find the Lawyer

Referral Service?
MR. FRANK:

He will find the Lawyer Referral

Service# because the bar is able to advertise that this
institution exists.
QUESTION: And where is that advertised# in the
newspapers
MR, FRANK:

It can advertise it in the newspaper

or on the radio or in any %/ay it wishes.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. FRANK:

It is done.

Wall# is it don©?
And there are —

QUESTION: Regularly?

MR. FRANK:

QUESTION:

this man»
MR0 FRANK:

If it doesn’t get to this man, then

he may have to do what people have traditionally done»
And let me say it’s not much of a problem»

Our town has

50 parcent over the national advertisers in divorces , and
people aren't having any trouble finding someone to get -them
for them.

Not any.

It’s just a zero problem in our

community.
If any, we have too many, they may be finding them
too easily.

But they are ‘there,

QUESTION:

Then they are just wasting their money

with this ad?
MR. FRANKS

These people say they’re making

money — I suppose it “*~
QUESTION:

They're just wasting their money,

according to your story.
MR. FRANK:
QUESTION:

Pardon? They’re wasting their money with this

ad.
MR. FRANK: They may or may not, it depends, obviously.

69

on how many do it.
But they make money,, as one of them said* and I
quoted him before:

"It's not my job to inform a prospective

client teat he needn’t employ a lawyer to handle his work.”
To the true professional and to most of the lawyers
in this room* that’s shocking.

It's turning a law office

into a butcher shop.
QUESTION:

Well* Mr. Frank* there was a — at

least when I practiced in Phoenix -*• the County Attorney would
do adoptions* but people who could afford adoptions would go
and have a private lawyer do it»

And I’m not at all sure

that all* every private attorney who was consulted necessarily
said* "Well* you could do just as well with the County
Attorney.”
MR. FRANK:

I am satisfied* however* that those

who sought to be conscientious* that you* when you were in
practise© and I must say I and Mr, Lewis * as practitioners*
don’t sell people services that they don't need,

And we’re

mighty scrupulous and invariable about it* and I hope true
professionals ar©? that's part of the meaning of profession»
alisra.
I pass over a little of the talk of what the
profession is and what we’re trying to do with it simply as
a matter of time economy* but I want to drive -this home:
that if

part of toe business of being a professional is —

70

and we acknowledge It — a kind of a status, part of the
privilege of that status, of being a lawyer and an officer
of feh© court, is a meaningful set of duties which go with
it. We’re talking about on® of them.
More than a hundred years ago, the English jurist,
A. V. Dicey saids

"The chief difference between a profession

and a trade is that in the case of a profession its members
sacrifice a certain amount of individual liberty in order to
insure certain professional objects.”
What I am saying is that being a professional means
taking your place in a whole network of privileges and
duties o
As this Court said, in Cohen v» Hurley, it ’was
overruled later, but on this point, this quote, the majority
quoted it and the minority adopted it. And what you said
goes to those duties s

It is certainly not beyond the realm

of permissible State concern to conclude that too ranch
attention to the business of getting clients may be
incompatible with a sufficient devotion to the duties which a
lawyer has to the court.
How, I have spoken of the direct damage to the
public, the kind of thing Chief Justice Traynor was talking
aboufe, in letting the snake-oil peddlers loose in the legal
profession.

But beyond that there is the injury which comes

to the profession itself and, through it, to the public, which,

71
I submit, benefits from it.
First of all, **QUESTION:
is arguable in a way:

Of course, Mr. Frank, I suppose this
didn't this morning's local paper

carry an article that the Michigan court is approving this
very thing?
MR. FRANK:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

And let ir.® go to that this moment and reorder what I have to
say and pick that up.
The key point is, on©, your comment'
to Justice Powell's first question.

goes directly

The problem is, who is

going to deal with this situation?
The fact is that there are & whole variety of
possible solutions, and what I am contending is that it ought
to be the Supreme Courts or the State Legislatures that can
determine, in the particular State, what is best to do.
There are a whole variety of proposals in the
country.

There is the California proposal, there is the

District of Columbia proposal, there is what Michigan adopted
today.

There is movement on the way to try to deal with the

problem of legal services,
And what w© face in this case is another example of
a wise observation attributed to Mr. Justice. Byrnes, when h©
was a Sanator at the time of the court acting plan, and after
there had been a resignation and a replacement, h© went to

Mr* Roosevelt, rims the legend, and says "Why run for a train
after you've caught it?"
The fact of tee matter is teat all over the country
there is movement, there is in my State, and these are
matters which are commonly and traditionally entrusted to
the State bars and the State courts to solve.

They do not

lend to legislation. The plain truth is that to deal with
all those refinements you asked the other side about, the
question of this

kind, thatr kind, and the other kind, you

can't do that by constitutional mandate? those things
take the kinds of regulation that the FTC has, pages of them.
Tills will b© permitted? teat will not,

To make the selectivity

which may be required.
The Michigan example is one.

Th® ABA proposal is

another.
Th© ultimate issue which is before you is: Are
you going to seek to solve this problem by tee constitutional
bludgeon, or are you going to permit fine, close work to be
done in the States where there is responsibility to, in
dealing with tees© problems of extending legal services?
QUESTION:

I suppos© one answer to one of those

questions about Michigan is that Michigan has elected to
experiment in on© way, and Arizona has elected to experiment
in another way.
MR, FRANK:

You've said it, Mr. Chief Justice,

73
better than I, and that is exactly what I wanted to say»
They are entitled to do it»
QUESTION: The reason I made the observation was
because of your "parade of horriblesB * that all I asked was
whether it wasn’t arguable because one State goes one way
.and another State goes the other wayQ
MR» FRANK:

It is —» but you will notice that all

of these proposals are very sharply limited to date»
New* with the experimentation* it may go farther»
But what we are really pleading for is:

in the desire to

solve tills problem* let us not destroy trie substance of the
sheer professionalism which we have built up* and I don’t
apologize for being classical on this score* Mr» Justice
Marshall* because we ar© dealing with a professional
tradition of hundreds and hundreds of years»
QUESTION:

But «*»“

And hundreds and hundreds ©f years ago

you had law offices with a maximum of three lawyers* with an
income of about $.1,0 *000 a year? and now what are we talking
about?
MR» FRANK: Well* I’m delighted to report to you
that at. least th© incomes have gone up* and some of the offices
are. bigger* soma are not»
I would like to* if I may* because I speak here
for fee profession* —
QUESTION: For example* Abraham Lincoln* in the case

74
you talked about, served for nothing®
MR. FRANK;

Frequently served for nothing, and

frequently took ten**dollar cases.

But Abraham Lincoln never

made but one ad in his life, and that was to put an announce*»
raenfc in the paper when he returned from Congress, to say that
his office was open.
QUESTION s All Ifrr< trying to say is that this is a
different day and age.
MR® FRANK*

That's all I'm trying to say.
It is a different *— it is a different

day and age, but it is ©n age in which professional tradition
has a contribution still to make.
Let me, if I may, conclude on a note of unabashed
sentiment®

I won't refer to the antitrust subject, merely

because it's fully briefed®
But I sit here with my partner, Lewis, he has just
celebrated his 74th birthday.

His father, with whom he once

practiced, was a Territorial Judge in our State, and the roots
of his practice extended back to the Nineteenth Century®
My own father died forty years ago,

He or I have

been members of the Bar of Wisconsin almost for all of -this
Century

my native State,
We have with us today a young lady who assists us

as the new breed of legal assistant.®

Because of her age,

she probably will b® linked with the law until the milienium®
The point is that just in this one case, on this

75

one side, the professional ties represent a hundred consecutive
years in. the law.
We know the weaknesses of this profession» its
limitations and its failures.

So, obviously, do the

members

of this Court.
We also, all of us, the few at this table, this
Court, the lawyers in this room, the thousands outside, and
those who cans before them have taken pride in being associated
with what is good about -this profession, pride in being
associated with it.
Minor figures, we, as individuals, may bey but our
line runs to Cicero and to Marshall and to Hughes, and we, too,
hope that

w&

serve in our small way.

May it never b© said that tois profession was
cheapened here, in this, its highest sanctuary.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Frank.

You have s> few minutes left, do you have anything
further, counsel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. CANBY, JR., ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CANBYs

Mr. Chief Justice, just too points.

The material where the name change is discussed
appears on pages 111 to 1.13 of the record, where Mr. O’Steen
was asked whether he ever takes up whether a lawyer is needed

76

at all with a client
QUESTION? What page?
MR. CANBY:
on to 113«

Well, 111 of the record , and I'm going

1811 paraphrase, I won't read this.
And he says : Well, no, except when it can be done

by administrative procedure, going to a department or some­
thing.

Then we send the client on his way with instructions

how to do it.
But if it's — then the next question iss

Yas,

but nothing in the law requires a person who is getting a
judicial name change to go to a lawyer, three out of ten in
this county go to the court, go to the clerk and do it
i

themselves.
that?

And the answer was — what do you say, then, to

And the answer was:

Well, we don’t know how well it’s

dons, w© don’t knew where instructions exist for this kind
of things, but we don't feel that we have to advise the
people that they could do it themselves.
Now, this — the final answer to this, of course,
is that it doesn't have anything to do with toe ad itself.
If the bar wants to make a general rule that every attorney
should advise every client that all litigants are entitled
to handle their matters themselves, then I think that's
perfectly proper and all lawyers can be instructed to d© it.
But it doesn't go to the question of what has been
advertised in this case.

The ad itself offers a service, and

77
it's not de cep tiv© *
The other point that I would like to make has to
do with to© comments that the court below found toe charge
misleading,
toe only mention about the expense of the divorce
in the lower court's opinion; The Supreme Court of Arizona's
opinion^ is on 12s of our Jurisdictional Statement# which is
that blue — it's in toe Appendix» And it says*

Mr,

Justice Gordon concurring separately says# "Moreover# I am
able to foresee instances in which the $175 fee quoted for
this service would b® unreasonably high „ K
Mr, Clients# in addition to the hours they put in#
toe brief hours on s. divorce# have put in# as the record
shows# many# many hours devising systems so that they can
handle it this briefly# and they also use paralegal time.
If divorces can be had more cheaply than -this#
let another attorney advertise that fact# and the public
will be even better served than they are by my clients.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURG&Rs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon- at- Is44 o'clock# p0m9# the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted»]
