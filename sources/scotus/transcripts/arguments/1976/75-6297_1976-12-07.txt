ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JANET M. CALVO e
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MISS CALVO:

Mr. Chief Justicef and may it please the

Court:
This case is an appeal —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
microphone & little closer to you?

Would you draw that
There.

And perhaps raise

the lectern a little.

That, will get you in better communica­

tion with the Court.

Very well.

MISS CALVO:

Thank you.

This case is an appeal from the judgment of a
divided three-judge court in the Eastern District of New York.
The challenged statutes in this case afford a statutory right
to United States citizen parents which makes it possible for
them to live in this country with their alien children.

It

does so by allowing the parent to request an exemption of his
alien child from restrictive numerical quota and labor
certification requirements„
As fully explained in our Reply Briefs the recent
Amendments to the Immigration Act narrow the scope of this
case perspectively to the issue of a United States citizen

4
parent: seeking the classification of his alien child as an
immediate relative and thus exempt from labor certification
and quota requirements«
While other similarly situated parents may prove
their family relationship with their children and thereby
obtain their entry into the United Sts,.-fees, citizen fathers of
illegitimate children ara completely precluded from proving
their parent-chiId relationship. ' Thus# Clsophus Warner# even
though he has formally acknowledged his child# always supported
his child, lives with his child# loves and cares for his
child# is completely unable to prove his relationship with
his child and to achieve his goal of living with his child
in this country.
This case is a unique one in Immigration Law
context on several grounds.
First and foremost# this case involves the rights
of citizens# not of aliens.

The challenged statutes were

designed to achieve the benevolent result of allowing a United
States citizen parent to live together with his child.

But

the statute discriminates against some United States citizen
parents# the fathers of illegitimate children.
In doing so# the statutes infringe on these citizens5
fundamental interests in their parent-chiId relationship,
a
And# as/possible consequence# the incidence of their citizen­
ship

5
Mr. Warner is put fee an impossible choice.

He may

give up his desire to care, for and live with his child, and
be able to live in tills country, the country of his citizenship.
QUESTIONi

Well, is that an impossible choice?

A great many American citizens live in other countries.

So

isn't "impossible" a rather strong word to apply to it?
MISS CALVO:

For Mr. Warner, it is a serious —

by "impossible" f a vary serious infringement on his choice to
live in the United States, the country of his citizenship.
In fact, his citizenship was a very hard-earned one, as Mr.
Warner is a naturalized citizen of the United States*
He chooses to live in this country, and he has made
tliat known by becoming a naturalised citizen and living here
for many years*
Another factor which makes this case a unique
immigration case is that the legislative history discloses
the total absence of any foreign policy concerns, or a
congressional choice to exclude or expel a group of aliens
who are perceived to pose a threat to our national security
or to our general welfare.
Illegitimate children are not. an excludable class
under the statute, and therefore there is no determination
that they are any danger to us.
These factors denonstrata that this case is funda-

6

mentally different from any of those prior immigration cases
upon which the government relies.
There is no question but that the actual and express
congressional purpose in passing the challenged statutes was
to allow citizen parents to choose to live with -their alien
children in tills country.

But the statute presumes that a

citizen father will never have close ties with his alient
illegitimate child arid will never want to choose to live with
him in the United States.
QUESTION;

How can — I find it a little difficult

to understand the argument in this ease and* indeed* in many
other cases that it was the — in view of the fact that Congress
did what it did* how can you argue that Congress5 purpose was
to do something else?

This is not a novel argument in this

case* we get it in a good many cases.

And I find it always

very difficult to follow.
MISS CALVOs

I think there’s a ~~ maybe the differ­

ence is between classification and purpose.

Thar© is nothing

in the legislative history which evidences any other intention
as an overriding purpose on behalf of Congress* other than
allowing parents to live with their children.
Of course* to the extent that a certain group is
left out of the classification system* they* therefore*
intended it* by emission* to leave them out.
QUESTION;

Unless this is wholly inadvertent* this

7
statute reflects the intent and purpose of Congress, does it
not?
MISS CALVO; Well, I —
QUESTION:

Unless it was accidental or inadvertent,

and I don't understand 'that to b<a any part of your argument,
MISS CALVO:

No* we feel that if,, in «seasideration

of the overriding purpose of Congress, if they knew that a man,
like Mr, Warner, who has acknowledged his child and always
cared for his child and lives with his child, would be totally
barred from proving his relationship with his child and
completely barred from living with his child, they wouldn't
have intended that result.

Because what Congress was basically

concerned with was allowing citizen parents to b© united with
their children in the United States,
QUESTION:

But that isn't the way we usually

construe statutes. is it» to: say that if Congress just had
known that tills precise language that it adopted had this
effect on this particular man they wouldn't have passed it
in those terms?
MISS CALVO:

Pardon me?

I didn't understand the

question,
QUESTION: Well, you're saying — are you suggesting
that because you think that Congress, if it had seen the effect
of this statute on your client, would have passed a different
statute, that w© ought to construe it in a different way?

8
MISS CALVO:

No# I*in not arguing that.

I'm just

arguing that# with regard to the overriding purpose of Congress#
the classifications as drawn are irrational and don't serve
that purpose.
QUESTI Or! s Well# what do you mean when you're talking
about the overriding purpose of Congress?

Surely# there is

no place where congressional purpose is better found than in
the language Congress has chosen to enact into a statute#
is there?
MISS CALVO:

I think that there*s a confusion

between classification and purpose.

You could say# in a case

in which a Legislature said that# "We're building a school
for whit© children? we don't want blade children to attend
itK# that that basically fulfilled their purpose# because -that
was the way the classification was drawn.
What we're saying is that from the legislative
history Congress specifically stated that by creating this
statute they were intending to promote the family unit of
tie United States citizen.

And we are further contending that

the classification which leaves out the fathers of illegitimate
children does not promote family unity.

In fact# —

QUESTIONi Well# but isn't the logical inference from
that# then# teat Congress did not intend to .promote family
unity with respect to that particular class
since it expressly excluded them?

of individuals#

9
MISS CALVO;

But you could say that about any

statute.
QUESTION: Well, we usually do.
MISS CALVO:

I think there6a confusion between

classification and purpose.

I mean, the — I think that in

its recent cases this Court has looked very closely at what
Congress said itself was doing, in its legislative history.
And that’s ~
QUESTION: Do you. think that’s better evidence of

that it chose?
MISS CALVO:
intent and purpose.

I think that there’s a confusion with
I’m not arguing that there was any •—»

•that it is any other than -the classification leaves out fathers
of illegitimate children.
QUESTION: But, at least, Miss Calvo, even on your
theory, Congress went part of ‘tire way.
MISS CALVO:

Yes, it is go part of the way.

It did

go part of the way by presuming -that parents similarly
situated to a citizen father of .an illegitimate child will
always have close ties...with their children.
For example, under the step-parent provision ©f the
law, if Mr. Warner married, he would be presumed to have close
•ties with his wife’s illegitimate child, ties that he is
presumed never to have with his own child.

And, on the other

10
hand, his wife would be presumed to have close ties with Serge,
his illegitimate child, ties that the father himself is
presumed never to have.
This is similarly true under other provisions of the
statute.

A father who fortuitously lived in a place where an

action on his —« by himself, he was capable of legitimating
his child, for example, by a simple acknowledgement, would be
presumed to always have close ties with -the child? while a
man like Mr. Warner, who has not only acknowledged the; child
but always supported the child and lives with the child,
because he doesn’t happen to live in such a place, is completely
precluded from even proving his parent-child relationship.
Also, aa adoptive parent, a

'prospective adoptive

parent, and the mother of an illegitimate child, under th©
statute, are presumed to always have close -ties with their
children, while the father of an illegitimate child, no matter
how close his ties may be in reality, is totally barred from
proving his close ties, and is presumed not to have these
close ties.
Basically, what we are contesting is this total
barring under the statute.

Especially in this case, where

the fundamental interest of a parent in -the care and
companionship of his child is involved.
Mr. Warner's case illustrates it.

He is, because
i

cf the abandonment of the mother, the only parent his child

11
has, and he is willing to take responsibility for that child,
as he always has, and wishes to live with the child in this
country, in order to do so.
QUESTION:
MISS CALVO:

How old is Serge now?
Now I think he’s about sixteen.

was much younger, of course, when the case began.

He

Xt8s been

around for quite a long time.
The government attempts to defend the discrimination
in -this case on the ground of purported administrative
inconvenience in the prevention of spurious claims.

There

were absolutely no congressional expressions that vis-a-vis
unwed fathers they were concerned about administrative
inconvenience.
Hut, in any event, 'the challenged potential, the
alleged potential for spurious claims does not justify the
discrimination in this case.

This is because any potential

for spurious claims in -the case of a father of an illegitimate
child is no different than the potential for spurious claims
for many other parents who are covered by the challenged
statutes,
For example, under the step-parent provision, the
immigration and consular officials would have to make the same
exact determination as they would have to make in this case,
■fhs paternity of an illegitimate child.
Practically, if I may point out, they already have

12
routine methods of doing so.

They have a system set up.

They

have forms. They know what kind of proof they want, to prove*
these relationships.
We do not contest or contend with any rigorous
burdens of proof that are imposed, what we seek in this case
is only the opportunity of the unwed father of an illegitimate*
child to prove his relationship by whatever proof the immigra­
tion or consular officials impose upon him.

It is clear

under the law that the burden of proof lies with the parent
of seeking the benefit for his child.
In summary, and I would like to

reserve the rest of

my time for rebuttal, -•*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MISS CALVO:'

Vary well.

—> it cannot ba over-emphasized that

what is involved her® is the rights of citizens who, like Mr.
Warner.» have always acknowledged and supported and taken care
of their children, and who wish only to be treated like other
parents, and given an opportunity to prove this relationship.
QUESTION%

I suppose, Mss Calvo, the government

disagrees with, your focus, it puts the focus on the child,
doesn't it, rather than the citizen parent?
MISS CALVO %
focus, Your Honor.

Yes, that is an entirely erroneous

If the parent does not request that the

child enter the States, the child does not enter the States?
that’s by statute at Section 204 of the Immigration and

13

nationality Act.
The benefit is given only to the citizen parent.
The child cannot claim entry under tha challenged statutes
marely because he is related fco a citizen. The citizen has to
specifically request that tills be don© on behalf of his child.
The citizen also has to further agree that he will
take care of the child, support toe child.

He must reveal

his assets, his —- and he must meet specific limitations which
demonstrate that he is capable and willing to support the
child while the child is in the United States.
QUESTIONS

Incidentally, suppose that it weren't

Mr. Warner we were speaking of, but his parents who lived
here and were citizens; would they be in a position, under
toe Act, to bring in,have Serge stay her©?
MISS CALVO:
QUESTION:
MISS CALVO:

The grandparents?
Yes.
No, Your Honor, toe special provisions

of toe Act relate to parents of the children.
QUESTION:

So "that siblings also would not be

benefitted?
MISS CALVO:
situation.

No.

No.

This is a very narrow

It’s a situation that deals only with toe parent-

child relationship.
QUESTION:
emphasize that

Miss Calvo, it occurs to ire that when you

the discrimination is between parento of

14

illegitimate children on the one hand, and parents of
legitimate children on the other, yon really are not entitled
to rely on the cases that rely on the unfairness of visting
the sins 'of the parents on the children.
Do you understand my point?
MISS CALVO:

X believe that there are — that there

axe cases in which illegitimacy discrimination has also --and I believe it was in the companion case to Levi , the Gloria
case, the illegitimacy discriminati or, was against the parent
as well.
Here there is — the party is a parent, and the parent
is discriminated against in several different ways in comparison
with several other similarly situated parents,
QUESTION:

It's on account of his own conduct,

whereas, in the case we just heard before, the child was being
discriminated against on account of his natural parente5
conduct,
MISS CALVOs
QUESTION:
MISS CALVO:

That's true,
Yes,
If you have no further questions, I'd

like to reserve the rest of ray time,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Miss Calvo,

15
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD R„ TYLER., JR. , ESQ»#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. TYLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the:

Court:
I think it is of the commonplace, of course, and as
a backdrop to 'this case, that Congress need not allow the
admission of any aliens, much less need Congress grant
immigration preference to any aliens.
The care of this case, of course, has to do with
the latter, that is, with preferences which Congress attempted,
to achieve by classifications adopted first in 1952 and,
most importantly for this case, in 1957, in Section 101(b)(1)
and (2).
Very briefly, the government claims that these are
classifications which Congress has the primary jurisdiction
to adopt, they are rational, and they are related to a i@gifc.i~
mate immigration purpose.; and thus they do not offend the
due process clause.
Preliminarily, I might say that there are certain
things which the government contends are really not involved
in this case, though one might assume so if you were to listen
to some of our arguments.
I think, as the plaintiffs concede, although I'm
not certain, but I think Miss Calvo said this, this is not a
case where illegitimacy, standing alone, or fathering an

16
illegitimate son. or daughter, standing alone, works an
exclusion or a bar under th© statute*

Nor is it a case where

classification is simply a routine distinction or a simplistic:
distinction, if you will, between men on th® on© hand, and.
females on the other hand*
And, finally, I might not©, this is not a case, as
plaintiffs apparently still argue, where the preference
provisions were designed to unify all families*
We: contend, rather, that the apparent intent, of
Congress, if you just look at the plain language of the statute,
was to re--uni£y families to the extent rationally feasible,
where there have been separations particularly caused by our
immigration laws, or some of them, and especially where those
separations were most likely to cause unusual hardship.
In short, w© urge that Congress acted not hap­
hazardly but discreetly and with car®.
For example, as has already been brought out. Congress
decided that children, legitimate or otherwise, over 21 or
married, get no preference at all.

Congress similarly decided

that children who have been legitimated, after they are 18 years
of age, get no preference.

Similarly, Congress decided that

children adopted after they are 14 years of age get no
preference.
They decided that stepchildren, made such by a
marriage, after they are 18, get no preference for admission

17
to these shores.
And# of course, for this case# as the Court well
knows# preferences by virtue of -the definition, of parent and
child go only to the mother and her illegitimat® child# and
not to the father.
Now# obviously# I assume# once we look at it with
reasonable care# we have to accept -that#if nothing else is
clear# a mother has ones been united with her child; but# surely
congress had in mind -that fathers necessarily never were united.
And I think this is legitimate concern# particularly where
you are dealing with a father who has never chosen to
legitimate his child prior to some point where an attempt can
be made to petition for entry.
Now# there can be no doubt about it, as the
plaintiffs argue# and as the Court knows# what Congress did
here wa3 set up a presumption.

But we

urge that it is a

presumption based upon a rational empirical judgment or
classification.
Furthermore# we urge that Congress quite obviously
made this judgment or cut on the basis of difficulties of
proof of paternity# and there’s no lawyer with a smidgen of
experience who doesn't know what the difficulties axe of
proof of paternity; and of course toe likelihood of spurious
claims # as Miss Calvo has pointed out.
Now# we do not urge hare that just because this is an

18
immigration case, or it’s a case arising under the INA, that
this Court has no right to look at 'the case? of course it does»
What we do urge is that the plaintiffs have ‘the burden of
proof of showing that the classification or cut by Congress
in deciding who was to be preferred and who was not to be
preferred, by defining children and parents , that this
classification or cut is irrational.
They fail in this burden, we submit, for several
reasons.
First, as has been pointed out to you early and
often this afternoon alone, by others in th© Illinois case,
illegitimacy has never been held, squarely by this Court to be
what is called a suspect classification.
For this reason, and because we are concerned with
the admission of aliens, a matter obviously of primary
jurisdiction of th© Legislatures, strict judicial scrutiny
is neither necessary nor appropriate.
As the Court has held recently, in domestic cases,
drawing of lines is peculiarly a legislative task and it's a
task where perfection is neither possible nor necessary.
Now, this is a rule, of course, that has been
enunciated for cases involving citizens who have the full
panoply of constitutional protection.

A fortiori, we would

urge it is probably the outermost limit that one could reason­
ably ask for an alien who is seeking preference for admission

19
to our country.
Let me conclude, if I may, with two points.
As if almost to recognise their difficulties in the
main issues, plaintiffs seem to resort to the claim that the
parent mid child definitions here in issue somehow invidiously
impact upon the constitutional right of a citizen.

Apparently

that is a right which 1 guess they call, as I read their
brief, a right to a unified family.
Well, I have two arguments to raise against that,
if the Court please.
First of all, I5m not sure that this is a right
which has been recognized in the Constitution, and perhaps in
a more specialized argument, it seems to me that one reason
we urge upon the Court consideration of the fairly recent
case of Kleindienst vs. Handel, which, to be sure, involved
First Amendment rights of a citizen in an alien context to an
extent, simply because Professor Mande1, as you*11 remember,
was seeking to be admitted to speak here and to converse with
academic people mid others who wanted to hear him.

And there,

as I understand this Court, it recognized that if the
constitutional rights of citizens w@r© to prevail in cases
which involve trie decision by the Legislature or the Executive
under delegation by the Legislature to exclude or keep out
aliens, then the congressional power to determine such
exclusion, which we all, I think, concede exists, would really

20
work out. to be annulled.
And, finally, if it may please the Court, I notice
that on oral argument, as in their brief, plaintiffs once
again contend feat somehow this case presents no foreign
policy issues or choices.

In other words, in 1957, as I

understand the argument. Congress didn't sit down and in some
way, either in the actual statutory language or in something
that w© all are trained to call legislative history, utterances
that this is a great matter of foreign policy or some foreign
policy choices.
I -thought that argument had been put to rest by
Mr. Justice Jackson 24 years ago in Haris lades, when h® pointed
out

.that when Congress makes these cuts and when Congress

determines who is excluded and who is admitted, and on the
reasons why, that that kind of a cut or that kind of classifi­
cation, by necessity, goes to the heart of our relation with
other governments.

This is a good illustration, as Miss Calvo

has properly stated.
One of the problems her© is that a good deal depends
upon the lavs of other jurisdictions, who gets admitted under
this statute or other sections of the Immigration and
Nationality Act.
QUESTION; Well, General Tyler, you say in your brief
teat the basis for this action in not giving preference to an
illegitimate child of an unmarried fatear is that tee child is

21
among a class — or that: the classification — that the father
and the child are members of a class# among whom it*s unlikely
that there would be any real close identification» And it’s
on this basis that the legislature# Congress# decided which
families to try to re-unify and which families not»
Now# why — I suppose you would concede that there
would be a good many father-child relationships# even though
the child is illegitimate# —
MR® TYLER:
QUESTION:

Oh# yes»
— where there has been a very close

relationship»
MR» TYLER:

Oh# yes# we have to®

QUESTION: Well# why not let them prove it?
MR» TYLER: Well# the difficulty is# as I said earlier#
Congress apparently was relying on two propositions which even
the plaintiffs’ sociological and statistical studies which
they mention in their briefs don’t really dispose of# as I
see it.

First of all# even the studies of a recent vintage#

referred to by -them and referred to by Judge Weinstein in
his dissent# show that 'the overwhelming

number of families#

the natural relationship# as Congress obviously opted for here#
is with tli© mother.
But you’re quite right# we can’t claim# and perhaps
the Cleophus Warner family situation is a good illustration
-*» there will be# because of these classifications or cuts# as

22
I somewhat simpiistically call them* situations which tug at
the heart-strings of any one of 'as.

QUESTION; well, suppose the person

seeking admission,

or the person for whom the parent seeks admission for- alleges
in a piece of paper certain facts that would indicate to
anybody that there has been a close relationship down through
the years, and suppose the government, in answering that,
knew what the facts were and said, Yas, we agree*

Now the

law would still exclude the child, the illegitimate child.
Why not let them prove it?

I me .an, why not -™

MR. TYLERs Because Congress —
QUESTIONS Why doesn’t the government want to sort
them out, one after — in an individual case, rather than as a,
group?
MR. TYLER; Well, I would urge very simply that
Congress mad© a choice with full recognition there would be
special cases where, hardship, where, as you say, might be
easy to prove. But I think Congress was -thinking of the bulk
of the cases.
QUESTION; Well, I know it liras, but why not --- is it
just the administrative cost or difficulty or sorting them out;
on an individual basis?
MR. TYLER;

Well, as the argument has been made,

in the legislature as recent as a few months ago, where
Congress is considering a bill to achieve -the result which the

23
plaintiffs urges, and which you're really talking about, and
on© of the considerations, of course, is; Would it really be
that, hard?
But our argument very simply is that congress has
the right and the power to decide this. And as long as it's
rational, even though you or I or anyone else could think of a,
better method, it really doesn’t solve the problem* on a
constitutional basis.
QUESTION; But you say it's — what is the rational©
of the — in excluding the -— in the particular child’s case,
if there has bean a close association down through the years,
and the government admits it?
What is the rational© for that?
MR. TYLER:

Well, that isn't "the determination as

I understand it that Congress made her©. Congress approached
this from another angle.
QUESTION: Well, I know what Congress said.

I'm just

trying to see what — you say it is a rational decision.
MR. TYLER: Well, it seems perfectly rational
judgment, although it’s been ~
QUESTION:

Is it rational because it's too hard to

prove it in some other eases, and therefore you don't want to
ask for
MR. TYLER;

Well, in a greet number, apparently.

Partly because of the differing laws about legitimate

24
children as opposed fco illegitimate children? partly because
of different laws as t© records? partly because of the horrible
problems of proving or disproving paternity.

And that's true

whether you're dealing with an alien or a citizen.
I can’t deny that there are oases.

Of course.,.

But our argument basically cones down to this ;
First of all, it's Congress that makes the choice,
particularly when we're dealing with questions of alienage.
And second of all, it isn't irrational fco make the
cut as Congress did it.
And I would have to concede 'fco you or anybody els®
that there will be these individual cases.

I'd have to concede

that if you went down carefully on a case-by-case basis
there would be some that the government would concede on, as
you point out.
But then there would be many, many that the govern­
ment would, not concede on.
But, as Congress has tried to —
QUESTION;

Wasn’t it Mr. Justice Holmes who said

one© that ©very line drawn by legislative action excludes
soma that could well have been left in, and includes some that,

MR. TYLER:

I think Mr. Justice Blackman said it

even more recently. But that's correct.
And here we have to accept, as Mr. Justice White's

I think what they decided to do was to talc© the
&

natural basis, as they understood it, and as the

immigration laws have presumed for many, many years, that
tee rational or most rational place for a child was with the
natural mother.

And that illegitimate, or the fathers of

illegitimate children, of course, in some instances, are very
close to their children.

But in many more instances, they

are not.
Also, if I may say, a father doss have a chance to
legitimate his child under tee laws of most every jurisdiction,
whether within or without tea United States.
Thank you very much.
QUESTION;
MR® TYLER:
QUESTION:

But teat cannot h® done in this -Mo.

Unfortunately, in that case, —

— one case, because tee mother has

remarried, and —
MR. TYLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And that presents a problem.

— and apparently under the local law of

wherever it is, in tee Caribbean, legitimation could occur only

26

by marriage of the parents.
MR. TYLER:

That*s my understanding*

That’s my understanding, too.

And I'm

sure there ars other cases, going back to Justice White's
point.

There's no doubt of it.
But our argument is that the Congress is entitled to

make the cut, even where it leaves out some and creates
individual hardships.
Indeed, if on© looks at other sections of tee
immigration laws, I'm sure this Court knows, you will see other
forms of classifications that surely tug at th© heart-strings
of any one of us, I assume; and if we were doing it, or if I
were doing it, I adroit I'd probably try to do it differently.
But we urge that that's Congress8 province, as long
as they have some reasonable basis so to do.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGSRs

Do you have anything

further, Miss Calvo?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JANET M. CALVO,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MISS CALVOs

Yes, Your Honor.

What tee government attempts to justify here is a
determination made on the basis of a bare stereotype which
allows total foreclosure of a group of people, and,in doing
so, infringes on a fundamental interest, in a parent-child
relationship

27

Now, maybe a reference to a recent case would be
helpful.

In Mathews vs» Luces, distinctions were upheld,

specifically because they did not completely and totally
foreclose a group from proving fee objective or the necessary
object in that case, which was dependency.
This was compared to the case of Jimenez, in which
the classifications were very similar, but the group of people
in feat case were totally precluded from proving dependency
which was the object in that case also.
In this case there is a stereotype that fathers of
illegitimate children don’t care a whit about their children.
I believe feat we have shown in our briefs that this stereotype
just isnet valid, that there are many, many fathers who do
care; about their children and our particular concern in this
case is wife our plaintiffs who do care about their children.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't Congress entitled to

legislate on fee basis of th© generality of human experience?
MISS CALVO:

I believes feat their concept of the

generality of human experience results in a stereotype her®,
and I don't believe that legislating on fee basis of the
stereotype, when it totally forecloses a group of people from
proving the object, which is in this case a family relationship,
is constitutionally justified.
I also might point out in feat regard feat the
classifications in this case aren’t only just mother-father,

28
although we do say that that is discriminatory, you also have
another classification like the 3tsp~ parent classification#
which is- completely and totally irrational»

You can’t presume:

that a man is going to hav® close ties with his wife's child#
but not with his own# and that she is going to have close
ties with his child that he never has»
That is the most irrational example in that situation»
QUESTION;
a second?

Miss Calvo# can I interrupt you for just

You suggest that the stereotype here is that there

is not a very close relationship between a natural father end
his illegitimate child# and that it's wrong to legislate on
the basis of stereotypes,

X think you would probably

acknowledge# however# that there are a good many instances in
which there is not a close relationship between a natural
father and an illegitimate child, and X‘m just wondering#
how does on© decide when that becomes a stereotype.

Because

there9s some cases that fit and some that don't,
MISS CALVO;

I think in this case that it's — thersa

has been sufficient proof brought to show that it isn’t a
stereotype —
QUESTION;

Well# I understand# in -this particular

case: .
MISS CALVO s
QUESTION;

Yes *
— this doesn't fife the stereotype. But

how do I know that we*re dealing with a stereotype at all#

29
that*s what 1 mean.

In other words, that the classification

itself doesn't have sufficient generality to be a legitimate
legislative decision,
MISS CM.VOs Well, there are several classifications
that are comparable here.

It's comparing the father with the,

mother, but also comparing the father in the step-parent
situation, or fathers with fathers.
QUESTION: Well, talcing the father and mother, would
you not acknowledge that more frequently there is a close
relationship between the mother and ‘the illegitimate child
than there is between the father and the illegitimate child?
MISS CALVO:

In that situation, there may foe? but

that does not justify totally —
QUESTION;

Well, does that not justify —

MISS CALVO:

— it doesn't justify totally foreclosing

the father.

Maybe it might justify imposing differing burdens

of proof upon him, but it doesn’t justify completely and
totally wiping him out, when his fundamental interest in his
parent-child relationship is involved,
QUESTION:

I'm just trying to figure out — you

acknowledge there's some difference, but yet you say that the
one relationship is a stereotype, and I*va often wrestled with
this problem, when does something become a stereotype?
that's what I don't quite understand,
MISS CALVO:

Well, I think that this Court has

And

30
had before it many cases in which fathers have — fathers of
illegitimate children have been close with their children»
The most, recent on® is the Jimenez case, in which Mr» Jimenez
was the sole caring parent of those children» And I also
believe that the statistics that we presented show that there
are a substantial number of fathers who live with their
children, that those fathers who don't live with their children,
very often support them and visit them, and perform the
sociological functions of their fatherhood# and taJce^
responsibility for the children»
QUESTIONS

Miss Calvo, could Congress pass an Act

denying citizenship to -any illegitimates alien?
MISS CALVO: Would you repeat that?

I'm sorry# I

didn't hear you,
QUESTION;

Could Congress pass sn Act denying

citizenship to any illegitimate alien?
MISS CALVO;

Period,

That would be a different case from

this one# because in that case 'there would only b® the rights
of aliens involved.

That case --- a determination in this

case that this law is unconstitutional would not necessitate
in -that case a determination»
QUESTION;
MISS CALVO:

Then I understand your answer is -—
Them are different considerations in

that situation.
QUESTION;

And your answer to my question is?

31
MISS CALVO:
about it.

I think it would — I have not thought

I think that it would have 'to be resolved on the
9

basis of its own merits.

And I would have to think about it

more before I could give you a specific answer on that»
QUESTION;

Miss Calvo# General Tyler referred to the

fact that sometimes in the country of origin a child may be
legitimated. Does this record show whether that was possible
in the French West Indies# where Serge was bom?
MISS CALVOs

Yes# it shows that the only way that

the child could be legitimated in Guadaknpe was by marriage
of the parents.

And this mother did not choose to marry Mr.

Warner# she chose to marry someone else.
QUESTION : That was iiie only way?
MISS CALVOz

Yes# that is the only way.

fairly common in many places.

And that5s

This concept of legitimation

or legitimate# sonte children are legitimate when bom#
«►

©van ■plough they are bom out of wedlock.

Some children of

adulterous relationships are legitimate also.

In other places#

children are legitimate only if the parents marry.
For example# in sortie places a father could have
custody of the child and b® supporting tee child and always
live with the child# but he is totally incapable of making
tee child legitimate under the law of the area.
QUESTION:

of course you have cases other than the

Warner case here# don’t you?

32
MISS CALVO:

Yes.

Those *— we didn't focus on

those, only because of the change in law.

We ~~

QUESTION: Are they moot now, do you think?
MISS CALVO:

No, we don't think

they are not

moot, because the recent amendments contained a savings clause*
which provided that if an application were mads before the
effective date of the law, which is not yet, that those people*
would b© entitled to whatever benefits they v?ould have been
entitled to under the old law.
QUESTION: Well, I wondered, because neither of you
has mentioned any case other than Mr. Warner.

But they are

her®.
MISS CALVO:

That's right.

We did not focus on

that esse because basically the issue that those other cases
presented is not really an issue, except for those two
people at this point.
QUESTION: Well- you probably didn't focus on them,
because the Warner case is the best case by far that you have.
MISS CALVO: Well, I think the other cases have -QUESTION:

It5s also all you need, isn't it?

MISS CALVO:

I think that I'd lik® to —

QUESTION;

When you speak of these stereotypes,

.

Miss Calvo, I'm not sura I know what you mean. Who determines
that some situation is a stereotype?
MISS CALVO:

Who decides that?

I think, Your Honor, that the govern-™

33
iriant tries to claim that it is common experience,- and I am
saying that it’s not common experience, because w© have shown
that ther© is enough evidence aid the individual fact situations
of the case show it,

and also the sociological data and

tha empirical data show it. Even the Census Bureau data shows
it.
And all the studies that were cited in th© brief
are all government studies.

They show it.

That fathers do

care about their illegitimate children.
QUESTION:

Well, are judges to assume that th© 535

Members of Congress aither are unaware of all of those factors
or are not capable of finding out about them?
MISS CM.VO:

I think that what the problem in tills

case is that it*s a total foreclosure.

I think that when there

is an individual, or a substantial number of individuals who
have close ties with their children, you can't completely and
totally wipe them out, foreclose them, on the basis of soma
presumptions.
I believe my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired.

MISS CALVO: Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:44 o' clock, p.m. . the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted. ]
