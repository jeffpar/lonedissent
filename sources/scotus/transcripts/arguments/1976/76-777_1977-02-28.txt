MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will next hear argu­

ments in 76-777, Peggy J. Connor, et al. v. Cliff Finch,
Governor of Mississippi, et al., and related cases.
Mr. Parker, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK R. PARKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, PEGGY J. CONNOR, ET AL.
MR. PARKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it pleas© the Court:
This cas© involves the reapportionment of the
Mississippi Legislature.

The cas© was filed on October 19,

1965, by black voters in Mississippi.

It is here for the fifth

time, following a final hearing directed by this Court last
term in Connor v. Coleman.

In that case, this Court directed

the District Court to hold a final hearing to the end of
entering a permanent court ordered legislative r©apportionment
plans to be applicable in the 1979 elections, and also ordering
any necessary special ©lections to be held to coincide with
November 1976 presidential elections or at the earliest prac­
ticable date thereafter.
In November of 1976, the District Court entered a
final judgment which was amended fay its order of December 21st
ordering permanent court ordered legislative reapportionment
plans for Mississippi which provided single-member districts
statewide.

No special elections have yet been

held under that

5

plan pursuant to fch© order of the court.
For the first time in this case, the District Court
complied with the 1971 injunction and the 1975 injunction of
this Court that in court-ordered legislative rsapportionment
plans, single-member district ex© to be preferred.
Plaintiffs contend first that the District Court's
Senate plan is excessively malapportioned; secondly, that the
District Court's permanent plan unnecessarily minimizes and
cancels cut the black voting strength in the Senate and in cer­
tain districts in the District Court's House plan; three, that
the District Court erred in ordering special elections in only
two House districts and in no new Senate districts; and, fourth,
that on® District Court srred xn denying plaintiffs their
motion for an award of reasonable attorneys fees.
The District Court in deciding the case and in enter\

ing final judgment employed two criteria which are directly
relevant here.

First of all, the District Court held in its

opinion reported at 419 Fed Sup, on page 107 6, paragraph 4,
there shall be no minimization or cancellation of black voting
strength.

That was the criterion employed by the District

Court and, as far as w© can understand from the briefs of the
defendants, that criterion is not questioned on appeal, that
everyone agrees that it was proper for the District Court to
promulgate a plan in which there is no minimization or can­
cellation of black voting strength.

6
And fifth, population variances are to be as near
d© minimis as possible,, and that criterion is not questioned.
It was fch© failure of the District Court to follow these
criteria,, in implementing its single-raerafcer districting plan
which plaintiffs question on appeal.
The, Senate plan is excessively malapportioned.

In

Gaffney v. Cummings and in White v. Regester, 1973 cases, this
Court held that in legislatively

enacted r©apportionment plans,

a plan with a total deviation, which exceeds 10 percent, is
prima faci® unconstitutional and must be. rationally justified
by legitimate state policies.
In Chapman v. Meier, the Court held that in courtordered legislative r©apportionment plans, that, the court must
ordinarily achieve the goal of population ©quality with little
mor© than, de minimis variation.
QUESTION:

And why is this a provision of the

Constitution?
MR. PARKER:
Meier

„

This is the applicable — in Chapman v.

the Court laid down standards applicable to —
QUESTION:

Well, it is th© Constitution that lays

down standards?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
tection clausa

That is correct.
What provision of the Constitution?
The Fourteenth Amendment, the equal pro­

7
QUESTION:

The equal protection clause.

So is this

a Reynolds v. Sims-type case or is it a Lightfoot-typ© case?
Is this the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifteenth Amendment,,
is ray question?
MR. PARKERs
involves both issues.

The case involves both issues.

The case

We challenge the District Court’s plan

on both grounds, failure to conform to one person-on© vote, and
for racial dilution.
QUESTIONS

There has only been I think on© case in

this Court involving the impact of the Fifteenth Amendment on
the electoral franchise, hasn’t there?
MR. PARKER:

Well, we believe that White v, Regester

also involved the Fifteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER;
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Would you say so?
Yes, air.
Did the opinion say so?
I believe it did, Your Honor, bscause

it involved dilution of minority voting strength in Dallas and
Baylor Comities, in Texas.
QUESTION:

I thought that was the Fourteenth Amend\

ment case, wasn't it?
MR. PARKER:

Wall, of course, the Court has failed

to distinguish between equal protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment as it prohibits racial discrimination and the
Fifteenth Amendment as it prohibits racial discrimination in

8

th© right to vote.

The asms standards very often apply in

both cases.
QUESTION:

Well, Reynolds v. Sims and that whole

line of cases has nothing to do with racial discrimination,
does it?
MR. PARKER:

That’s correct.

That has to do with

malapportionment, and both issues are involved here.
QUESTION:

And a case like Lightfoot has everything

to do with the Fifteenth Amendment?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Except for Mr. Justice Whitaker's con­

currence.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
.

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Correct.
That's correct.
And my question is which provisions —

which amendments of the Constitution are at issue here?
MR. PARKER:

When we say that the District Court's

plan is excessively malapportioned, that involves Reynolds v.
Sims and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
as. it relates to population disparities.

When we say that the

District Court's Senate and House plan of certain districts
dilute black voting strength, we're applying both the racial
discrimination prohibitions of the equal protection clause of
:±b Fourteenth Amendment and more specifically the Fifteenth

9

Amendment’s prohibitions against abridgement of the right to
vest© on account of race.
QUESTION:

And is it ~~ while I have interrupted you

—- your contention that it was incumbent upon th® District
Court under th© Fifteenth Amendment to maximize black voting
strength?
MR. PARKERs

No, that is not our contention.

We do

not at rail contend that th® District Court was under a duty to
maximize black voting strength.

Our only contention is that

the District Court, as th© District Court itself recognized,
was under a duty to avoid dilution of black voting strength,
to avoid minimizing or cancelling out black voting strength,
Wa. are not after reverse gerrymandering, we're not after
maximizing black voting strength.

We simply say that th©

District Court, as the District Court itself recognized, was
under a duty to avoid dilution, and it failed to do so.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Parker, just to follow up on Justice

Stewart's question, avoid dilution as compared with what?
MR. PARKER;

Avoid dilution in terms of — and I will

demonstrate this on th© map.

For example, Claiborne County is

74 percent black and has black county elected officials, almost
all th© elected officials in Claiborne County are black.
Claiborne County was combined with Copiah County
District 3, and Lincoln County, which is majority white, to
create a district-wida white majority in that Senate district.

10
And that is dilution, when a substantial black population
concentration is combined with a mors populous whit© papula­
tion concentration to creato a district-wide white majority,
then dilution occurs.
QUESTION:

Well, the facts speak very loudly.

I

understand your argument, but I am not quite sure you have
answered ray question, dilution as compared to what.

As com­

pared with the racial make up cf the population.?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So -fchat anything less than the proportion

that the population itself bear's is at least suspect?
MR. PARKER:

If a plan can be drawn which meets one

parson-on® vote requirements and also does not fragment or
disperse the heavy black population concentration, resulting
in the opportunity of black voters to elect legislators of
their choice, then that alternative should foe selected, all
other things being equal, if it meets constitutional require­
ments .
Our contention is that the District Court, in promul­
gating its plan, failed to accept the alternatives proposed by
the plaintiffs and by the plaintiff intervener which alleviated
or cured the dilution of black voting strength in the District
Court's plan.

In other words, there ware alternatives pre­

sented to the District Court which did not dilute black voting
strength, and it is the failure of the District. Court to select

11
those alternatives which is erroneous and on which we base
our appeal.
QUESTION?

Under the District Court’s plan are there

now districts where whites are in the minority?
MR, PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, there are districts —
And are there any such districts where

those whites under the former plan were not in the minority?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes., there are.
Well, wouldn't white people have the same

kind of a claim that you are asserting on behalf of Negro
people?
MR, PARKER:

Mr, Justice Stewart, the Mississippi

Legislature has been all whit© until 1967, in this century.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

I know.
There are now four blacks in the House

■and the Mississippi Senate is all whits.

No claim has ever

been made in Mississippi that white people are deprived of
legislative representation either by the —.
QUESTION:

Well, I am talking about the District

Court's plan.
MR. PARKERr

Thero i(" no cl~£r. presented to this Court

that it deprives whit© people of legislative representation.
QUESTION:

But under the District Court’s plan there

.■are districts where whites are now in the minority —
MR. PARKER:

That’s right.

12
QUESTION's

— and those same voters used to b® in a

district that was majority whit®?
MR. PARKERs

That’s right.

They are not discriminated

against because legislative representation is based mor© on
interest groups than individuals.

At most, blacks under the

District Court’s plan could elect legislators ©f their choice
in. possibly 24, 25 or 26 districts? thus, in a 122-member
Mississippi House, the Mississippi House of Representatives
will be still predominantly white.

The Senate will have at

most possibly seven or eight black Senators.
be predominantly whit®.

The Senate will

So there is no real claim of discrim­

ination against whit® people in the District Court's plan.
QUESTION:
MR, PARKERs
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

What is the population, 63-37 , is that it.?
Mississippi is 36.8 percent black.
37-63 —
37 percent black.
— plus a fraction of one percent of

others.
MR. PARKER:

Right.

That's correct.

Now, th© District Court's plan has a total deviation
from population equality of 16.57 percent prima faci® unconsti­
tutional .
QUESTION:
your responses.

Let me get one thing clarified, on© of

Are you suggesting that the population ratio

of 37 must be reflected?

13
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

No, w© have nob mad© that argument.
la other words, you are standing on your

response to Justice Marshall, 1 think, that there is no claim
on your part of the constitutional right to, the term is, to
maximis® the —
MR. PARKER:

No, we don't make that claim.

We simply

say that the District, Court was under an obligation to avoid
dilution, and that is as far as our plan goes.
QUESTION:

Well, ©a© man's dilution is another man's

maximization, is it not?
MR. PARKER:

No, that is not necessarily true, be™

cause the District Court was providing a remedy here.

The

District Court was providing a remedy for the failure of the
Mississippi Legislature to adequately apportion itself, number
one?

And also, number two, although the District Court failed

to recognize it, the District Court was providing a resi@dy .for
the extensive past history of racial discrimination affecting
the right to vote in Mississippi, and this Court has never
held in the race cases that when a District Court is fashioning
a remedy it must b© color-blind remedies.

Certainly, a remedy

must b© race conscious, otherwise the remedy might have the
same effect as the violation.
For example, in the employment cases, in the jury
cases, in the other school oases, the Court has indicated that
the District Courts may taka race into account in formulating a

14
remedy.

So we are not maximizing black — our claim is not

that black voting strength should be maximized.
false issue.

This is a

It is an issue raised by the defendants which

is not in the case.

Our claim is only that the District Court

was under an obligation to avoid dilution of black voting
strength, and they failed to do that.
The alternative, the modified Henderson plan, which
was proposed by the plaintiffs, has a total deviation of only
13,66 percent, and therefore is a better plan.
QUESTION;

Mr. Parker, when was the modified

Henderson plan first proposed by the three-judge court?
MR. PARKER:

It was proposed on October 8, 1976 as a

supplement to our motion in the District Court to alter our
mandus judgment.

The District Court gave no reason for re­

jecting the modified Henderson plan which provides greater
equality of population among the districts, over its own plan
which provides less ©quality of population among the districts.
The plan was presented to the District Court on
October 8, and the final judgment, was not rendered until
November 18.

The District Court failed to state any reason

for preferring ins own plan with higher variances over the
Henderson plan with lower variances.
QUESTION:

Can you tell me again what the percentage

variations ware in the October 8 proposal?
MR. PARKER:

The District Court’s plan is 16=57.

The

15

plaintiff’s alternative,

the modified Henderson plan was

13.66, was based exclusively on county boundaries, supervisors'
districts and voting precincts, breaks up only 15 counties, as
opposed to 19 counties in the District Court's plan.
The District Court's plan also in the Senate unneces­
sarily fragments and dilutes black voting strength.

This map

illustrates the 11 instances in which black majority counties,
which are colored in red, are combined with more populous white
raajority counties to create, districts which have whit© voting
majorities.

Arid the particular illustration of this is

Claiborne County, which is combined with Beat 3 of Copiah
County and the more populous white majority of Lincoln County,
to put Claiborne County, which is 74 percent black, i:a a white
m a j or i ty d i s tr i ct.
Similarly, Jefferson County, which is just to the
south, is 7 5 percent black ~~ Mayor Charles Evers is Mayor of
the county seat, Fayette — is combined with two beats in
Adams in the top and two beats in Adams in the bottom, and has
the largest deviation of any of the District Court's districts,
minus 3.3 percent.
The plaintiffs' alternative plan would have — the
districts are not compact..

The plaintiffs’ alternative plan

would have been to put Claiborne, Jefferson and Copiah in a
single compact district, not break any county lines, result in
a black majority district, with a total deviation of only 3.5

16
percent.

So thus plaintiffs’ alternative would have alleviated

the dilution of black voting strength, would have cured the
malapportionment, would have provided a more compact district,
and would not have broken any county lines.
QUESTIONS

I take it you are arguing that idle three-

judge court plan is unconstitutional as well as being an abuse
of its discretion in adopting it?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

That is correct.
Is that right?
We believe that under chapman v. Meier

the discretion of the, District Court is more limited than if
the legislature had enacted this plan, that in a court ordered
plan a District Court has a more strict, a more rigid responsi­
bility to avoid dilution of black voting strength, and the
standard is a more strict one than under a legislatively en­
acted plan.
Hinds couircy, the district Court’s Senate districts,
53 percent of the black population of Hinds County is concen­
trated in this rad shaded, area which looks like a boot in the
central city of Jackson, which is the state capital.

All five

of the districts, the Senatorial districts adopted by the
District Court in the Senatorial plan, cut into this heavy
black population concentration, sliced it up, dispersed it
among all five districts.

This is a, copy of Exhibit P-44,

which is in the Kirksey case, of which the District Court has

3.7
taken judicial notice and which is in the record»
Districts 2 and 5 have slight black population
majorities, but measured in terms of voting age population, all
five districts have white voting age population majorities
under 1977 Census data.

So black people in Hinds County,

8 4,000 black people live in Hinds County, has a greater b3.ack
population concentration than any county in the state.
County is 39 percent black.

Hinds

Those 84,000 black people living

in Hinds County are deprived of the opportunity to elect state
Senators of their choice in any of the five districts.

QUESTION:

And what, cases do you rely on — or maybe

18

you don’t rely

or

them.

What cases do you think apply the

Fifteenth Amendment to representation rather than just the
voting?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Well,

VKS —

Do you think anything besid.es Gemillion

or not?
MR. PARKER:

We rely very heavily on White — w© say

that Whit© v. Regester indicates standards which are applicable
to legislatively enacted plans, and that provides some indica­
tion.

But we think that Chapman v. Meiers is the principal

case.

Chapman v. Meiers said that multi-member districts in

court ordered plans are no good, among other reasons because
of charges and complaints made that the multi-member districts
dilute minority voting strength.
QUESTION:

I know.

I understand your dilution argu­

ment, but I am asking you where it came from.

Is it under the

Fifteenth Amendment, do you think, Chapman v. Meiers?
MR. PARKER:

It canes under the Fifteenth Amendment,

abridgment of the right to vote —
QUESTION:

Did it in Chapman, was it expressly under

the Fifteenth Amendment?
MR. PARKER:

No, Chapman was under the Fourteenth

Amendment, no claim of racial grouping was made.
QUESTION:

That is what I am asking you.

Give me the

cases that talk about dilution of representation, as a

19

Fifteenth Amendment violation.
MR. PARKER:

Well, Reynolds v. Sims, the goal of

Reynolds v. Sims was fair and effective representation.
QUESTION:

Under the Fourteenth Amendment?

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Under the Fourteenth Amendment.
It didn't mention the Fifteenth, did it?

MR. PARKER:

It did not mention the Fifteenth Amend**

QUESTION:

Before you leave Hinds County, ar© you

supporting the Department of Justice plan as to Hinds County?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, there ware several Hinds County

plans that v?srs placed in the record.

Our preferred plan is

the Hinds County Census Tract Plan, which I believe was
Exhibit P-14 in the trial court record, which is based exclu­
sively on Census tracts determined by the Bureau of the Census
in Hinds County.

plan and plaintiffs put forth an additional Hinds County plan
in th© record.

So there ar© several Hinds County plans in the

record.
QUESTION;

I suppose one msr.it of th© three-judge

court plan for Hinds County is the small variance?
MR. PARKER:

All of the plans in th© record have very

21
small variances.

The Hinds County census tract plan had a

variance —
QUESTIONs

The Department of Justice plan is 12 per­

cent .
MR. PARKER;

Th© plan

which was favored by th©

plaintiff only has a total variance of about 3»5 parcant.
QUESTION;

Which is greater than the three-judge

court's plan?
MR. PARKER:

It is not my understanding that there is

a substantial difference between our proposed plan and the
three-judge court's plan.
QUESTION;

Well, there is two percentage points ap­

proximately.
MR. PARKER:

There are a number of alternatives

which could avoid dilution of black voting strength and still
conform to on© person-one vote requirements.

Th© other maps

relating to the Mouse districts are contained at th© back of
the reply brief, and I would simply refer the Court to those

maps, showing dilution of black voting strength in the House
districts of which ws complain.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BE HAH'' OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
MR. WALLACE;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

C

22

the Court?
Th© United States has taken no position in either the
District Court or this Court with respect to tha controversy
about th® adequacy of th© District Court’s plan under the on©
person-on© vote criteria»
W© have, however, taken a position with respect to a
dilution of black voting strength and with respect to the need
for additional special elections besides those required for
two House districts by the District Court.
In neither of those instances, however, have we
found, it necessary to reach any constitutional question, nor do
we see any reason why this Court should do so.

We have been

taking our law from Chapman v. Meier, "which distinguishes very
sharply between what is constitutionally permissible if adopted
by

3.

state legislature pursuant to state policy and. th© proper

remedial criteria to be used by a District Court in th©
absence of an acceptable state plan in formulating relief, and
as a matter of the proper exercise of th© court’s discretion
of an equitable matter, we believe that there wer© errors hare
in the court’s plan which we have specified.
But before getting to those errors, I should point
out that much of the court’s plan is acceptable and, after a
course of very long litigation, substantial progress was made
with th® formulation of this plan.
1965.

Th© litigation began in

Our own participation is much more recent.

We intervened

23

in Jun© of 1975 in the District Court»

But even so, I think

that son© of the contentions before this Court by the state
parties have lest sight of what has already been decided.

Th®

case has been in this Court on four previous occasions and a
great deal has been decided *
For example, a question has been raised about tha
propriety of th© District Court's adopting a plan involving
all single-member districts.

Well, the decisions in Connor v.

Johnson, in 402 U.S., and the next Connor case, 404 U.S., said
that the District Court was to favor single-member districting
in the court ordered plan.
the Connor rule.

This is what has become known as

And it is lata, in the day — not just as a

matter of star® decisus — it is late in the day as a mattes:
of res judicata for the stab® now to bs arguing that because
of Mississippi's

longstanding policy in favor of multi-member

districting, the Connor rule should not be applied in the case
in which it originated and in which this Court’s instructions
to the District Court were quite clear.
If that question should be reconsidered at. all, it
is improper to ask that it b® reconsidered in this case, in
which it is the law of th© case.

And the District Court

therefore quite properly favored a single-member district plan
and in working that out adhered to the extent that it could to
the state's longstanding policy of trying to maintain the
boundary lines of the counties, th© beats and precincts, and

24

largely succeeded in doing so.

those criteria.
vidually.

W® don't really attack th® guidelines indi­

We don’t have any quarrel with any on© of them in

particular’ as an appropriate guideline adopted by th© District
Court in formulating its final plan.
Ws do, however, attack th© criteria that th© District
Court used in refusing to order additional special elections,
so that our stance is a little different with respect to th©
two issues in that way.

We think that those were inherently

erroneous reasons for refusing to order special elections,

we

don’t think th© guidelines adopted by the District Court in
formulating its final plan, war© individually inherently
erroneous, although we may quarrel with the weight given on©
as against another.
Th® main shortcomings there ware errors of omissions,
as w© sae it, a failure to adequately remedy the longstanding
use e£ apportionment as a method of diluting .minority voting
strength, and th© failure to recognize the importance in th©
case of voting age population rather than just general popula­
tion statistics, which differ considerably in th© state of
Mississippi from the realistic measure of voting strength that

25
is all we realistically talk about in assessing their oppor­
tunity for all elements of the community to participat® mean­
ingfully in the electoral process.
The principle of Chapman v. Meier specifies that, it
applies to multi-member districting and to population devia­
tions, and it seems to us that tbs same principle almost
necessarily must also apply to remedying a pattern of dilution
of minority voting strength such as has been shown in this
case, which we have detailed in the record and in a lengthy
appendix to our brief.

And we have shown the extent to which

these problems persist.
Wow, I want to address briefly the question of maxi­
misation against dilution as it is involved in this case.

In

Mississippi, the black voting age population constitutes 31.4
percent of the population.

And I am sorry we never drew these

figures together in the brief in discussing the dilution ques­
tion .

We have compiled then just in the course of preparing

this argument.
Under the court plan, in the Senate, where there ar©
52 districts, there would be only four ar 7 „7 percent as
against the 31.4 percent which would have what wa think the
.record shows is the minimum needed 54 percent of black voting
age population in order for the black electorate to have a
working majority.

We have cited the references in the record

which show that all of the estimate . that, was needed for an

26
effective working majority are 54 percent a'nd on up.
But. even if you look at 50 pereant black voting age
population,, there would b© nine districts, 17.3 percent, as
against the total of 31.4 percent.
Under the alternative plans which were before tha
court which ws have pointed to in our brief, most of the
difference between the plaintiffs and ourselves arise from the
fact that the plaintiffs attempted — and wa don't say that
this v7as improper at all — to project thair figures from the
1970 Census to approximate the 1975 population distributions,
whereas in our participation wa limited ourselves to the 1970
Census figures which the District Court indicated that it
planned to follow.
Under the alternatives that we propose for the
Senate, the number of districts with 54 parcant or more black
voting ag© population would be increased from four to six or
from 7.7 percent to 11.5 percent; and those 50 percent or more
would be increased from nine to eleven, or 17.3 pereant to 21.2
percent, still wall under the 31.4 percent

which can be used

as a starting point to see whether unnecessary fragmentation
of black voting strength constitutes a dilution that should be
avoided by a court of equity undertaking to remedy a long­
standing pattern of discriminatory dilution of black voting
strength»
And the same thing can be said of the House figures.

27
There is 122 membership figure for the House»

There, under

the court’s plan? 17 of those districts or 13.9 percent would
have 54 percent or more black voting age population, and 24
of the districts or 19.7 percent would have 50 percent or more
black voting ag© population.
Under the alternatives that w© point to, those figures
would be increased from 17 to 22 for the 54 percent figure,
which would give 18 parcant black voting age population, 18
parcent of th© districts; or, in the 50 percent black voting
ag© population, th© increase would b© from 24 to 26 districts
or 22.1 parcant of the total 122 districts, in each case still
wall under the 31.4 percent of the total population that is
accounted for by th© blacks of voting ag©.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, focus again for me why you

suggest with scm© emphasis the use of 54 percent.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, the testimony in th© record, and

w© have summarized it in Footnote 46, page 53 of our brief,
indicates in on© instance an estimate of 58 percent and th©
other an estimate of 54 to S5 percent as the percentage needed
in order for black voters to have an effective voting majority.
There is other evidence in the record to indicata that blacks
are registered in lower proportion than whites, so if you are
using voting age population statistics, -they don’t really re­
flect th® strength at th® polls.
whaz

There is testimony that

re register®! consistently fail®!

28

to vote; about 10 percent of the blacks who are registered
have never voted.
QUESTION %

Well, I just asked the question.

the answer to that to get out the vote?

Isn’t

Why should the

federal courts of this country take into consideration that
kind of a feature and kick it up to 54 percent rather than 50
percent?
MR. WALLACE:

Ideally, -that is the answer, but the

testimony indicates, and there are no findings to the contrary,
there are just no specific findings on this at all by the
District Court, that the difficulties with getting out the
vote are to a large extent a result of the prior pattern of
discrimination, that many of the older blacks are afraid of
economic reprisals if they vote, that there has been a long
history of intimidation and fear with —
QUESTION:

Can you say the same thing, make tbs sain®

argument about the sexes?

I think there are patterns between

the masculine and feminine sexes and who votes more.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, I wouldn't make --

Why not?

MR. WALLACE:

— any such argument without basing it

on testimony in a record, in evidence.

I don't think it is

the kind of thing that can be hypothesised.

We are really

addressing ourselves with the 54 percent figure to very specific
evidence developed in the course of -this long trial.

And there

29

is the additional distinction that there hasn't been since
the adoption of the constitutional amendment entitling women
to vote sex state imposed discrimination that might result in
intimi ation of woman.
At any rate, w® are confining ourselves in this case
to what this record has shown.

But even if we go down to the

lower figure of 50 percent, as I indicated;, we would still be
well under the 31.4 percent figure if th® remadias that we
have, proposed were adopted.
I just would like to say a word about th® kind of
dilution we are concerned with.

On® example which I think is

fairly graphic is to be seen on page 55a of our brief3 one of
these pullouts.

This one happens to involve Warren County.

Th© point has been mad® bafor® this Court that you
can have th® same kind of dilution as a result of splitting up
a multi-member district so that each single-member district
has the same basic percentages as would ba true of the multimembor district..

And th© figures under the court's plan for

Warren County provide almost a classic example of that, where
there is almost uniformity in th© three districts her© in th©
House in the percentage of blacks in each district.

And each

case has a percentage of total population between 40 and 45
percent.

Th© black voting age population is more uniform,

in each case between 39 and 41 percent.
And under our alternative plan, the alternative plan

30

that was before the court, which we mention there, on© of
those districts could be drawn in actually a more compact way,
as shown by th© maps on the preceding pagas, so as to have a
56.6 percent black voting aga population, whereas the other
two would be majority white.

And hare in a district in v/hich

tbs black voting age population is close to 40 percent, in­
stead of having three majority white districts, on© of the
three would ba a majority black district.
That is th® kind of deficiency that w® have found in
feh© plan.

I just want to say on® more word about a complaint

that th® state has mad© on page 4Q of this reply brief, Foot­
note 32, that somehow the difficulty here has been the failure
of th© Attorney General to apply the criteria of this Court’s
decision in Beer to th® state's legislatively adopted plan.
The Court decided in 421 U.S., in on® of the previ­
ous decisions in this case, that that legislative plan would
have no legal effect until and unless cleared.- pursuant to
section 5.

The plan was than submitted to th® Attorney Genaral

who interposed an objection on June 10, 1975, many months
bafor® Bear was decided by this Court, on March 30, 1976.

Of

course, sines this Court’s decision in Bear, w© used the
criteria enunciated by this Court.

But at th® time this objec­

tion was interposed., the District Court’s decision in Beer was
th© authoritative determination

of th© meaning of the Voting

Rights Act, and there has been no submission by the state

31
since that time , and there is no section 5 issue in this
case.

There is. nothing before the District Court under sec­

tion 5 that would have had to be before the District Court of
the District of Columbia.
I believe we are reserving the remainder of our time
for rebuttal.
QUESTION?

Mr. Wallace, before you sit down# there

seesaw to he aoub differ 4».ofc in the variance figures employed
by the three-judge court and in those that you proposed in
your brief here.

On which are wa to rely?

MR. WALLACE:

Well# we have had great difficulty

determining how the court's figures were calculated.

Wo have

done seme reexamining of our own figures and have explained
in the course of cur brief the modifications# simple ones#
that can b© made in our proposals, and we in Appendix B of
our brief recounted in detail exactly how our figures were
compiled.

And I can't, verify anything but our own figures,

I feel that they are reliable as we have reexamined than.
If they had been put to a test in a hearing in the
District Court# I think some,of the refinements that wa have
made would have bean mad® in the course of the District Court
proceedings.

That is all I can say about the figures,

feel that w© have presented, reliable figures her®.

we

We don't

know what the District Court's are.
QUESTIONS

Normally that is something for the District

32
Court rather than for us to work out.
MR. wall&CEs
QUESTION?

Well/ we understand that.

One last question.

Do you support the

private parties claims with respect to the House districts in
.Mams County?
MR. WALLACES

We haven't taken a position on them

but. we see nothing wrong with their claims.

Wa sea nothing

wrong with their projections to the 1975 figuras, which are all
based on undisputed testimony and a study mad© by a state
university.

Nothing has been introduced in the case to con­

trovert any of their contentions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. P. SUMMER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI
MR. SUMMER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our appeal hare is from the 1973 court ordered
single-member plan for Mississippi and for two special elec­
tions ordered vndar that plan.

I will present our appeal in

regard to the fractionaliz&tion of county linas and special
elections.

Mr. Leonard will present, associate counsel will

pr@scui.fc our argument in response to the racial dilution
argument that, has just been given.
I might say, however, at the beginning that I am
quite surprised —I have been in this case for seven years —

33
to find the plaintiffs 8 attorney say this morning that they
had not progressed from the one man-one vote to a guaranteed
black district.

It comes as quite a surprise to me because I

believe about five — well, I won't say that — a good portion
of this tim© has been spent developing that progress in each
case.
I also was surprised to hear the government’s
attorney say that we had been foreclosed in making our argument
against a sing la-member plan that was ordered by this Court
for the first time in 1976, in view of the fact that this case
lias been here, this doss make the fifth time that the case has
been before this Court, but, unfortunately it has never been
hare on tha merits.

We. have never had the opportunity to

orally argue the case, and this is the first time that it has
bean here on the merits itself, and we are delighted that -that
time has finally crane, because in the instance where this
Court first spoke to the lower court in regard to its 1975
plan — and we do advocate the acceptance by this Court of the
1975 plan as drawn by the court, we feel that that plan has
never been declared unconstitutiona! by any court.

In fact, it

has been specifically, the things that were spoken to here
this morning were set out. specifically by the trial court in
reaching all of the objections they made there.
And when this'Court first spoke to the lower court
in regard to — it was in regard to Hinds County.

district.

We have

Wa only have on® metropolitan

We are not a large state in that we have cities

like Chicago or Detroit.

Jackson, Mississippi is the capital.

It has approximately 200,000 people.

It is within Hinds

County.
So as a result, Hinds County is entitled under the
1970 Census to twelve legislators.

This Court sent word back

to th® lov/er court that the plaintiffs have shown us that
within three days they could prepare four — if I am not
mistaken, either two or four — different plans for Hinds
County to be single-member districted.

Therefore, District

Court, you should be able to d© so, and we stay your order
until June 14, 1975, until you prepare a si»gl©-zn©nbar plan
for Hinds County absent insurmountable, difficulties.
Well, when we held 'the first hearing back in Jackson,
plaintiffs' counsel frankly admitted that th© plans that he
had submitted to this Court were based on erroneous information,
and there was no possibility of those plans working at all.
The court appointed a master and found that, there war® insur­
mountable possibilities because th® census was taken by
enumeration districts and not by the governmental districts,
that is th© county and the beat lines.

So as a result of that,

it was impossible within that short period of time, and th©
lower court so notified this Court.

35
And the next time when it cam® up, I think this
Court having seen it severe»! times sent it back to the lower
court and said, look, you have prepared a plan, you have kept
jurisdiction of Hinds,

Harrison and Jackson County —

Harrison and Jackson County on the Mississippi Gulf Coast -and next to the most populous counties in the state,
QUESTION;
MR. SUMMER:
Harrison County.

Is that Beloxi down there?
Yes, sir, that's correct.

That is in

Jackson is just to the east of that.

They said — you gentlemen said fix Birds, Harrison
and Jackson Counties,

In the meantime, we are going to dismiss

the appeal, w© are going to vacate the judgment so that when
you fix Harrison and Birds and Jackson County, we can get th©
whole case before us up here, and that was your Oder then.
And then you admonished them, of course, that — the lower
court had said it would be ideal to single-member district
Hinds County.

You agreed with that and said to the effect:

what is now known as the Connor rule, that single-member dis­
tricts are preferable if most member districts can't ba articu­
lated ,
So here we war© with a situation that began to — a
rule had begun to go all around the country that specifically,
as it applied to us — this Court had spoken to Hinds, Harrison
and Jackson County.

They said you single-member district Hinds,

Harrison and Jackson County and send us th© whole plan back,

36
then we will decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of that plan.
Eventually that was don©, and I say eventually be­
cause there is implication
ware dragging their feet.

her© that there ware people who
Throughout this entire period of

time, the legislature has been acting and acting and acting.
Every time this Court cam© down with a case, they would pass
another r©apportionment plan,, trying to conform with it, pre­
venting the lower court down there from taking, from going
fosrward£, because you also said that it is bettor for the
legislature to do it.

So the court said if the legislator© is

going to do it, w® are going to let them do it.

And then as

scon as they get to the District Court, of course, then the
constitutional challenge was made end the plans that ware re­
ferred to- by the plaintiffs' attorneys here war© plans that
violated a longstanding state policy which this Court has
recognized in Mahon and Chapman ©f never breaking or fraction­
alising a county line since, it, has been a state of this Union.
i

Mian it was admitted to the union, in 1817, a con­
gressional act called the Mississippi constitution together,
provided that two to six members be represented from each
county in that constitutional convention.
we became a state.

That was even before

In the constitution of 1817, there were

provisions for multi-member districts in the State ©f
Mississippi,

in the constitution ©f 1832, there was provision

37

for multi-member districts.

In 18 69, right after the Civil

War, when the carpetbaggers and the scalawags, they were socalled , all joined hands, and they leapt the multi-member
districts and mad© no effort to change then whatsoever, speak­
ing to tli© dilution, the racial dilution, aspects.

And in

1890, it, was not changed.
So for 150 years there has never been a parson
elected to the Mississippi Legislature by the breaking of a
county line.

Wa have 82 counties.

into five supervisory districts.

Each county is divided
Those supervisory districts

&r© —
QUESTIONs
MR. SUMMER;

They are called beats, are they?
Yes, sir, they are, called beats.

And

a supervisory —
QUESTION:

Just as a matter of curiosity, where does

that word cm© from?
MR. SUMMER:

When it was old — it used to ba the

old police jury, and I guess they got,the beate from that,
police beats, and they just continued that on.
QUESTION:
MR. SUMMER;

B-e-a-t?
B-e-a-t-s, beats.

Actually, officially,

it is a supervisory district, but the words are synonymous,
and it is referred to as beats.
A supervisor is elected from each beat, which is
well defined, as he was pointing out her® on this map, there

38

has been litigation her® in Hinds County going on now for a
considerable period of time, and it is up for a rehearing
back in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals now.

Of course,

Mr. Leonard will address what the judge had to say in regard
to the dilution question in that.
So there are 410 beats, but the five supervisors in
each county is the governing body.

They have a chancery

clerk, a circuit clerk, a sharrif and so forth.

Now, the

main thing about that is that they are autonomously elected
by the people of those counties and, of course, they are
answerable to nobody.

But the big difference is that the

counties that they act in only an administrative capacity.
They have no power to tax.

They have no power to set a

<

judge’s salary, for instance, as the judges' salaries are set
by Congress, I guess, for the entire United States, everybody
gets the same.

That is not -true in Mississippi.

That legis­

lator from that county, if he wants his judge a raise, has
got to come and get that judge a raise.

Thar© are as many

different salaries for judges, county judges in Mississippi
as there are county judges.
county attorneys,

The same thing is true for the

in fact, even whether or not a county will

have a county attorney must, b© decided by the legislature.
So if you fractionalize a county, you destroy the
very fabric of which the government of Mississippi is made up,
and this is why we object

bo

strongly to a single-member plan.

39
We are not against s ingle-men ber plans and certainly we are
not promoting multi-member plans.

We are simply saying that,

as this Court spoke to the issue in Mahon and spoke to the
issue in Chapman and other cases, that it spoke specifically
to the fact that longstanding state policies qualify to
create variances that would not be acceptable in any other
standard.

In fact, the Court in Swann said that — it spoke

to the fact that there were about 30 to 35 percent, and even
indicated by stating in that cas© that -- and it was a courtdrawn plan

that the results may have been different if the

state policy had been articulated by the judge that drew it.
And in this cas®, in the 1975 plan, th© District
Court articulated very clearly and very outstandingly th©
necessity for this longstanding policy in Mississippi.
I see that it is 12 o'clock and —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That is all right.

The

red light will go on.
MR. SUMMER:

I'm sorry.

But they did articulate,

they took the test that was laid down in Chaves, they took th©
test in White v. Register, and they specifically spoke to
each one cf the

far as dilution is concerned.

But then going to the county government qualifying
as a rational -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

41
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

is00 O’CLOCK
Mr. Attorney General,, you

may proceed.
MR.

SUMMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I was spaalcing to

the importance of the county government as a unit in the State
of Mississippi, and I had already enumerated a few of the
most, important facts and I would like to add a few more to
that because, the counties without special legislative authority
cannot issue bonds even to build a courthouse or to provide
for industrial improvements or to levy

taxes for those things.

In fact, everything they do must h© authorized by the legisla­
ture because they act, as I say, administratively.

And, of

course, this is not don© on a blanket basis, it is done on a
ecunty-fcy-ccuaty basis because Mississippi has a private and
— local «and private section in its constitution very similar
to that which Virginia has, and perhaps even more stringent,
that the Court alluded to in the Mahon case.

So you can see very clearly that to vulcanise or
fractionalise county lines would change the whole structure of
government in Mississippi, a structure that has existed since
before its statehood, and to diminish that would simply make
baggers out of the fractionalized counties, and it would
affect the system of justice, it could affect crime prevention,
cause electoral problems, causa economic problems, and it would
affect the county's ability to aid the poor, the disadvantaged,

42
the old, the sick, through the various county programs that
they have for that, because each, of those have to be approved
by the legislative plan.
And to familiarize the Court with the ‘7 9 court plan,
42 of the 82 counties have been broken or fractionalised, and
at least 44 of these supervisory beats have been fractional­
ized ,
Another important factor to point out there is that
the precincts that the people of Mississippi vote in are con­
tained entirely within a. supervisory district, or a beat, and
if you change a supervisory line or if you change a beat line,
as the plans of the plaintiffs have submitted to this Court
do, they cross street lines, they cross county -- I mean the
voting precinct lines, it would call for an entire new regis­
tration, and I think all of us would agree that as long and
as hard and as difficult as it has been over the years to
finally get the black population of Mississippi registered,
and in Mississippi one© you are registered, you are registered
i

for life unless you move, out of the district, so you don’t
have to go register every year, you stay registered for life,
and a chance in this system, if you had to change all of that,
could cause a massive registration and perhaps a dropping from
the rolls of many of the people who now can vote.
Speaking to on® question that was brought up by the
plaintiffs, in the new plan, the ‘79 plan that fractionalises

43

the county lines, there are in the Mississippi House of Repre­
sentatives , there are 30 districts with a black population of
over 50 percent.

Thera are 40 districts with a black popula-

tion from 36 to 50 percent.

So 7 0 of 122 representatives

would be elected from a 36 par cent c which is basically the
percentage in the House? 70 of those district representatives
would be elected from districts with 36 percent or more? and
in the Senate 14 majority black population over 15 percent
districts, and 12 districts between 36 and 50 percent, which
makes a total of 22 Senators who could b@ e icteri.
And as on© of you said in an opinion, I believe it
■was the Fifth Circuit opinion, though, in the Florida case,
that said if you have got that type population you er© going
to ba receptive to them if you expect to gat their vote.

And

certainly they participated very strongly in the '75 elections
to the end that it was stated that the black vote was primarily
responsible for the election of the present Governor.

But

again, I am not going to get into my brother's argument.
I would like to address as my last point the fact
that the District Court had no authority to order the two
elections in the '79 plan,

safer© the district plan can order

a remedy, it must find a constitutional infirmity.

This Court

spoke to that in Swann v. Mecklenburg when it said that there
had to be a constitutional violation before the great equity
powers of the federal court could reach it.

And the District

44

Court, found that this '7 5 plan was in fact constitutional;
and it has never been found unconstitutional by any other
court.
And even if this Court were to find that the District
Court was required to formulate single-member districts state­
wide and thus affirmed the '79 plan, the District Court would
still lack the authority to order the elections, the reason
being that the plan was not found constitutional, and therefore
all of the legislators who were elected under the 1975 court
plan were constitutionally elected, and there is no decision
to the contrary anywhere., regardless of the fact that the
plaintiffs and the interveners would like to convince this
Court that somewhere these facts are all new that as1© being
presented to this Court.

Everything that has been spoken her®

has been presented many times.
Thank you very much.

Vary well. General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRTS LEONARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. LEONARDS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it picas®

the Courts
My name is Jarris Leonard and, as the Attorney
General has said, 1 will address the question of the relief
requested by the plaintiffs and by the plaintiff -intervene»: s

45
and their ©ntitlement thereto, and also th© question of racial
dilution which ms alluded to in th© questioning this morning.
I would frame th© issue raise! in this case in this
manner:

In a state where blacks have total access to th© po­

litical process, evidenced by th© fact that 65 to 75 percent
of the voting age blacks are registered to vote, against &
national average of only 55 percent, and where 60 to 70 per­
cent of those blacks who are eligible to vote actually do vote,
as compared to only 34 percent on a nationwide basis, am
where blacks hold over 200 local offices, hold 25 of the 100
seats on th© Democratic stata Executive Committee, as wall as
the state's co-chairmanship of the Democratic Party of th©
State of Mississippi, where blacks have played important roles
in both the Republican and Democratic campaigns for Governor
in 1975, and are credited with carrying th© state for th©
President in 1976, where a report by th© Department of Justice
fails to disclose a single actionable violation of black
voting rights, where the plaintiffs' key witness and their
important evidence fails to disclose any vestage of racial
discrimination against blacks in the electoral process and in
th© political process of this state, and where a r©apportion­
ment plan has bean fashioned by a Federal District. Court, and
it is found fee b® racially nondiscriminatory.
Based on those facts, th© issue I believe is -whether
under such circumstances a Federal District Court in fashioning

46

sudi a plan of raapportioament must first abandon a 150-year
policy of non-fracturing of county boundaries; second,, abandon
a 150-year policy of using multi-member districts; and,
finally, affirmatively racially gerrymander th© legislator©
in order to guarantee or attempt to guarantee th® ©lection of
a certain percentage of blacks to that legislaturs.
Now, that is what I believe the issue is that has
been framed in this case over its long history.

Gen. Summer

has addressed the question of the. state's policy and history
relative to th® multi-member districts and their us© and the
non-fracturing of county boundaries.

My argument will b© con­

fined to th© constitutional rights of the plaintiffs or the
lack thereof, to a remedy and to the remedy that they seek.
And I trust that the Solicitor General will not take umbrage
if I tak© the position that. I think the Constitution is defin­
itely involved in this case, and that constitutional standards
are applicable whether th© plan of r©apportionment is drafted
by a. federal court or whether it is drafted by th© legislature.
The Legislature in th© State of Mississippi is on©
of the six coequal branches of government of our federal
system, and its reapportionmanb as in the case of its 49 sister
states should be judged by constitutional standards and not by
the supervisory power of this Court to direct something to a
lower federal court.
So X think without question the Constitution is .

47
involved*, and I think it is a Fourteenth Amendment question,.
Justice White, and not a Fifteenth Amendment question.
Now, the plaintiffs3 argument is fashioned around a
scarlet letter philosophy, having sinned in the past, no
amount of reform, no matter how extensive and complet©, will
b© recognized as having overcome the past and the citizens
of the stata must forever bear the stigma of that past.
Every constitutional question, it seems, that is
raised by every action taken by the state must be viewed in
the perspective of the past and not by the facts as they ex­
ist today, if we accept the argument of the plaintiffs.
I submit to the Court that things have changed in
the State of Mississippi.

It is not the Tuskeegee, Alabama of

Garni11ion v. Lightfcot, nor is it the Bexar and Dallas
Counties of White v. Regestsr.
The findings with respect to this case are contained
in this case, contrary to a statement made by our opposition
earlier today that there are few findings, there are extensive
findings in this case made by Judge Coleman at 396 Fed Supp.
Mow, that was a 1975 decision.

But all of the evidence in the

case except for son® of the new reworking of the reapportion-4
ment plans, all the basic evidence was in the case, and Judge
Coleman made extensive findings in that decision.
He found that the political process in the state was
totally ©id completely • open to black voters, and that finding

48

is really not seriously disputed by the plaintiffs.
In a companion cas©, in Kirksey v. Board of
Supervisors of Hinds County -QUESTIONS

Well, that fact is irrelevant to the

dilution argument, I take it?
MR. LEONARDs

That fact is relevant to the dilution

argument -QUESTION:

But not to the population variance?

MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Write.

Nov;, are you addressing all these argu­

ments together or are you going to separate them?
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

The thrust of my argument —

What are you arguing, just dilution?

MR. LEONARD:

— relates to the racial dilution and

the affirmative gerrymandering.

That is the thrust of it.

I

would ba happy to answer those other questions also, but that
is the thrust of —
QUESTION:

Wall, I was just wondering, on the

variance, population variance issue, what is your submission
as to — or is there any limit to tin® population variation
that might be — that you claim to b© justified by following
county lines?
MR. LEONARD:

Thera must fo@ — let me point out on©

small —QUESTION:

Well, ia the state's submission here that

49
none of the county lina-bre&kirg should bm countenanced, that
everywhere the District Court broke a county line —
MR. LEONARD?
QUESTION;

— it should bs reversed?

MR. LEONARD;
QUESTION;

Ho.

Msf it is not, Your Honor.

Well, then, what is it arguing in that

respect?
MR. LEONARD;

Our point is that if there is to be

any fracturing whatsoever, it should b© d© minimis and only
when the clock runs out, and that is what happened in the. ’7 5
plan.
QUESTIONs

Well, when doss the clock run out?

When

do you get to such a population variation that you have to
break a county line?
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

Well, the population —

Do you make a submission on that or don’t

you?
MR. LEONARD:

I would make a submission, yes.

X

would say that the variation in this case which, because of the
fact, that the figures are — non® of the figures are as certain
as they should bs, appears to be about 20 percent.
QUESTION:

How —

And that is not enough?

MR. LEONARD:

And I would say that is not enough, and

let me — it is off the dilution argument, but let me follow up
and say why.

In just the time between 1970 and 1973, the

50

population, of Hinds County, the largest county, changed by 18
percent.

That is enough for on© House member alone, just in

three years.

So if w© get too hung up on the figures and

fehair absoluteness, we delude ourselves because the figures
ar©' changing, the population changes so fast in almost ©very
state.
QUESTION %

But d© you think --

MR. LEONARD:

And I would submit that the 20 percent

variation,which is the approximate variation in the s75 plan,
is not a —
QUESTION:

I talc© it then that — do you support the

*75 plan right across the board or not?
MR. LEONARD:

Yes, we do, Justice White, and we

would ask the Court — and I will in my closing point that out
we support the *7 5 plan.
QUESTION:

And you sa.y that it is a Fourteenth Amend-

menfc case and not a Fifteenth Amendment case?
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

Well, was the Fifteenth Amendment relied

on in this case?
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

No, it was sot..

By the plaintiffs?

MR. LEONARD:

The plaintiffs so stated this* morning.

I don't see how this question is a Fifteenth Amendment question.
This is an equal protection question.

It is a question of

51
compelling state interests for having cartain laws relating to
\
the ways in which a legislature is reapportioned in order to
avoid

the other process.

The process which will result

logically from the plaintiffs’ argument is eventually a po­
litical gerrymandering.

Those who have the power, whether

they be the conservatives or the liberals in the legislature,
whatever their political situation may be, will use that
philosophy in the 1980’s and beyond to exclude others with
whom they have political differences.
And this Court in a dissent, Justice Douglas, in
Wright v* Rockefeller, Justice Stevens, than Judge- Stevens, in
Cousins v» City of Chicago, laid cut in those dissents all of
the horribles that coma about from that process.
But on the dilution theory, Judge Mixon, in a com­
panion case, said this:

This court does not find that any of

the electoral laws presently in effect in Hinds County or this
state operate to make it. mere difficult for blacks to equally
participate in'the electoral process.
Judge Coleman, in the decision I referred to, said
this:

We have

no

difficulty in holding that at the present

day interference with the right of black citizens to case
their ballots is a myth.
Then does there not corn® a time in the evolution of
the political process when the yoke and the burden of the past
is lifted from state government, when its political

52
institutions to the extent that the allegations of racial dis­
crimination are made must be established based on present-day
conditions, and with credible evidence, and not with recita­
tions of the litanies of by-gone years.
Judge Nixon put it this way in his decision:

There

is a point in time whan past instances or examples of racial
discrimination become remote, a time when a past history be­
comes a remota history.

That time has arrived for Hinds

County and, on behalf of the state, we submit that it has
also arrived for the State of Mississippi.
QUESTION:

Mr, Leonard, getting; to the present, as

I understand your other side says that the linas that have
been drawn in the last few years have effectively diluted the
vote of th© Negro.
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Well, that is not th© past.

He is talk­

ing about the present.
MR. LEONARD;

Justice Marshall, that is not the

finding of the District Court in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, what plan is he talking about?

MR. LEONARD:

I do not know, but the District Court

made -QUESTION;

Well, you heard him?

MR. LEONARD;

I heard him.

The District Court made

extensive findings, Judge Coleman mads extensive findings —

53
question?

Well, extensive findings that Negroes are

not denied the right to vote means nothing to this case.
MR. LEONARD:

Justice Marshall, I can only tell you

that the '75 court plan —
QUESTION:

Of course, he can vote —

MR. LEONARD:

— provides for 14 Senators that will

be elected from populations with over 55 percent black —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LEONARD:

My only —

— 30 representatives from the House,

a total of 76, as tits Attorney General pointed out —
QUESTION:

What about the. way Hinds County was broken

up?
MR. LEONARD:

That is part of the Hinds County cas©

which has been affirmed by the Firth Circuit thus far —
QUESTION:

Is it here?

MR. LEONARD:

It is not hare.

QUESTION:

is not here?

It

MR, LEONARD:

Do you' mean is it involved in this

case?
QUESTIONs

Y©S.

MR. LEONARD:

-Yes, because it was incorporated in

— the Hinds County apportionment was incorporated ~
QUESTION:

That is not — that, is recent, that is

not ancient history.
MR. LEONARD:

Justice Marshall, what I m trying to

54
point out is that the Fifth Circuit affirmed Judge Nixon, the
Fifth Circuit has ordered a hearing an banc so its treatment
©f the Hinds County question has not yet been disposed of.

But

the Hinds County districts -that are in this case now, in the
'75 apportionment, ’79 apportionment plan and the '75, hav©
been approved in the Kirksey decision.

That is my understand™

ing of it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Leonard, is it not correct that they

have been approved only with respect t© the numerical problem,
not the dilution problem?
MR. LEONARD:

No, I believe Judge Nixon addressed

the dilation problem in the Kirksey decision, as did the Fifth
Circuit in affirming —
QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit addressed, the dilution

problem, did it?
MR. LEONARD:

It addressed the racial discrimination

problem, whether it was raised in the terms of dilution is —
the point is that the issue of racial discrimination by virtu©
of dilution and the apportionment of the county was raised.
QUESTION:

Lst ms just ask on© other question, so

that l can find the answer in the written materials, that are
quit© voluminous.

Your opponent put th© map up with the

senatorial districts in Hinds County with th© two long fingers
in Districts 32 and 33 going into the town, which are somewhat
reminescent of Gomillion and so forth.

Where is th© state's

55

explanation of how those — why it- was necessary to draw
those rather? unusual boundaries?
MS. LEONARD:

I believe, Justice Stevens, that the

explanation is that, because, as Attorney General Summer
pointed out, the county is an administrative unit more than
it is — administrativa and judicial more than it is a legis­
lative unit, unlike our concept of county boards in the north,
where county boards have broad hom© rule powers, broad legis­
lative functions.

Such is not the case in Mississippi.

She county supervisor — and this is the history of
the term ’’beat" — had a beat that he walked apparently be­
cause fee supervised the reads, saw to it that the roads were
taken care of, he acts more like an alderman in a city, taking
care of the ministerial, municipal functions of the government,
as opposed to acting as a legislator.
Now, that is not and of itself justification, as
this Court has taught, but it is one of the factors that needs
to be considered when you draw an apportionment plan for feliat
kind of a governmental unit.
QUESTION s

But is there anything in the written

materials, including anything th® District Court said, which
explains why the lines were drawn in Hinds County the way they
war®?
MR. .LEONARD;

My recollection, Justice Stevens, is

that the District Court, in 396, addressed all of those issues,

56
including tha apportionment of Hinds, Harrison and Jackson
County, and why it. made the choicas that, it did.
QUESTION s

Sisre is nothing in your brief on that,

precis® point?
MR. LEONARD:

I think that there is not on that pre­

cise point.
We believe that this Court means what it says in its
decisions a:ri that its teachings are equally applicable to
Mississippi as they are to Marion County, Indiana, to the
0

State of Taxas, to Washington, D. C., and Arlington Heights,
Illinois.
This Court said in Whitcomb v. Chavis, which was
the Marion County, Indiana case, that tha challenger must
carry th© burden of proving that multi-member districts
unconstitutionally operate to dilute or cancel ths voting
strength of racial or political minorities.

There is no such

proof in this case.
This Court said further that such schemes or devices
must be purposeful in order to further racial or economic dis­
crimination.

There is no such proof in this case.

And this Court said further in Whitcomb that the
failure to win elections is not th® test but, rather, evalua­
tion — but, rather, exclusion from ths elective process is
th© test that must be applied.

And the proof in this case

gives no indication that blacks ara excluded from tha process.

57
The opposite is true, they fully participate,
QUESTION:

How do you £©©1 about a case a little

while ago, United States v. Classic, said teat although the
man wasn’t denied the right to participate, his vote wasn't
counted.

Do you rent-amber that one?
MR. LEONARD:

Well, if his vote wasn't counted be­

cause the election officials were corrupt —
QUESTION:

It said that it had to be a meaningful

vote, that is what Classic said.
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

Well —

And that was about thirty years ago,

MR. LEONARD:

Justice Marshall, I think that the

proof in this ease indicates that the blacks not only partici­
pate but that they are a political power in the state of
Mississippi.
QUESTION:

They have how many people in the legis-

lature?
MR. LEONARD:
House this time.

They have four members of a 122-member

But there is historical reasons for that, and

that •s that the blacks did not participate in the party elections prior to 1970 •—
QUESTION:

There is another historical reason, too.

MR. LEONARD:

Yes.

This Court said in White v.

Regester teat there must foe a showing of invidious discrimin­
ation that excludes minorities from the political process by a

58
practice of slating of candidates, was the practice in Texas,
so that, they were unable to gain access to the party primaries.
That is not the case her®.

The primarias ara open primarias,

any candidate can run in either primary of his choice, and
there is no slating of candidates as was countenanced in Texas.
‘This Court also said in Whit® that multi-member
districts are not per se unconstitutional.

In the 1975 plan

that is before this Court, the multi-member districts are few
in number, they are small in the number of members in each
multi-member district, and they ar© compact in sis©.
This Court reiterated in White that it was the
plaintiffs' burden to prove that the political process leading
to nomination and ©lection was not open to all groups on an
equal basis.
This Court said just ^.ast year in Washington v.
Davis that official acts era not unconstitutional solely be­
cause of a racially disproportionate impact, without showring
of © racially discriminatory purpose.

And the Court in that

case cited Wright v. Rockefeller.
This Court said that there must ba motivation based
on racial consideration, there must be a contrivance to segre­
gate on the basis of race.

Only where the totality of the

facts disclose an invidious discriminatory purpose would a
statute otherwise neutral on its fee© be struck down.

And we ar© taught in Arlington Heights the same

59
thing.

The reference in that case to Goad 1 lion as to stark

discrimination, it could hardly be said that the situation in
this case can be referred ©e compared to Gcmillion and that
the facts in this case are stark.
Now, in the case at bar, the plaintiffs and. the7"'
interveners allege but have not shown that the three-judge
District Court's plan® were,either

*7 5 or *7 9/ racially dis­

criminatory as they are applied to black citizens in
Mississippi.
Wa are not here defending the Unit®:;! States District
Court.

We have appealed from its decision.

However, th©

record in this case is barren of any proof that either of
these plans, the *7 5 or the *7 9 court ordered plan, are tainted
with any racial motive for discriminatory purpose.
I opened by phrasing th© issue; let rae close, may
i

it please-the Court, by seeking this as relief, that in the
state of Mississippi ail citizens enjoy the privilege of fran­
chise irrespective of their race, color or creed; that the
political processes, including the seeking and holding of
elective office, ar® open to all? that black citizens partici­
pate in that process in th© party of their choice and to the
extent, that their desires and abilities carry them in that
process? that the three-judge federal District Court found
its 1975 plan of apportionment of the state legislature to be
constitutional, to be in conformity with 150 years ©f official

60

history of that state in th-a use of multi-member districts
and in keeping county boundaries intact? that the deviation
£r® the norm of the two houses in that plan is within con­
stitutional limits and governed by the facts in this case?
and that such plan shall remain in full fore© and effect until
tli© legislature shall reapportion based on th© 1980 Census
according to the laws and constitution of th® state of
Mississippi and the United States of America; and that this
case be remanded to the District Court with instructions to
enter its final order in conformity with such opinion.
In that way, may it pl®&£© th.® Court» will this long­
standing litigation foa drawn to a close and thus end th© constitutional inquiry.
Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR, PARKER ?.
QUESTION;
you.

Thank you, Your Honor»
Let me put this hypothetical question to

It may or may not ba too relevant.

Suppos® hypothetically

that th© State of Mississippi could be reapportioned, lines
drawn irrespective of counties, s© that in every county» in
every voting district rather» th® voting strength would be a
reflection of th® total state population, that is 37-63.

would

61

that meat all coast!tntional standards?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

If a court ordered plan both ~
Anybody * s plan.
*— conform to on® person-on® vote and

also provide a proportional representation?
QUESTIONs
ME. PARKER:

Yes.
I don't think it would be unconstitu­

tional, no.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't that foe the acme of per­

fection?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would not 1m unconstitutional,
It would certainly diluta some of th®

voting strength, wouldn't it?
MR. PARKER:

Not if it provided for proportional

representation to all interest groups.
QUESTION:

Has the court now ordered proportional

representation?
MR. PARKER:

No, and we don't insist upon that in

this case.
QUESTION:

Lay aside proportional representation,

which is not in this case, as I understand it
MR, PARKER:

Do you mean if every legislative dis­

trict was 37 percent black and 63 percent white?
QUESTION:
.MR. PARKER:

Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood th©

62
hypothetical.

So, that wouldn't be adequate.

QUESTIONS

it wouldn't b© adequate?

MR. PARKER:

It wouldn't be adequate.

there is a history of racial block voting.

In Mississippi,

White voters refuse

to vote for black candidates or candidates favored by the black
community.

In that hypothetical, the result would inevitably

foe an all-white Mississippi legislature.

We have gained four

already in this case; please don't deprive us of them.
QUESTION:

I thought you were prepared to concede

that that was the acme of perfection?
MR. PARKER:

Not if every legislative district was 37

percent black, no, not at all.

That would deprive blacks of

the opportunity to elect legislators of their choice in the
stata.
QUESTION:

How are the courts going to reach the

subjective attitudes of the voters, either Negro or white, in
terms of how they should vote?

How does any decree of any

court reach that?
MR. PARKER £
Mr, Chief Justice.

That is in the evidence of this case,

A number of political scientists and

sociologists testified with regard to voting patterns in this
case.
Let me rebut several arguments mad© by the defendants.
First of all, they rely on the District Court's findings at
396 Fed. Supp. 13 08.

Unfortunately, that District Court

63

decision made those findings upon which defendants rely was
reversed by this Court at 421 U.3.

And this Court in revers­

ing that District Court decision upon which defendants rely,,
stated specifically that the District Court accordingly also
erred in deciding the constitutional challenges to the acts
based upon claims of racial discrimination.

.r

396 Fed. Supp

So in reversing

this Court vacated those findings by the

District Court, and the'defendants can't rely on them hare
because they have been reversed.
Non® of the alternative plans railed upon by the
plaintiffs — split voting precincts — are based on supervisor
statistics.

All of the alternatives upon which plaintiffs

relief ar© based either on county lines, supervisor districts
or voting precincts.

So those could be implemented immediately

without any required re-registration ©f the voters.
Now, the plan upon which the defendants rely, the
1975 plan, is totally invalid under this Court's decisions in
Chapman v. Meier and the other cases upon which w® rely.

In

other words, in order for the Court to accept defendant's
proposal to reinstitut© the 197 5 plan, the Court would have to
overrule East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, Chapman,
v. Meier, Mahan v. Howell, Connor v. Williams and Connor v,
Johnson.
Now, the defendants made a big argument about what
was in the record with regard to county government.

There was

64
nothing in the record with regard to the question of how the
legislature runs county government.

Judge Coleman was a

former Governor of the stats and a member of the legislature,
and would not have ordered 'this plan into affect if it had
been unfeasible.
Thank you.
