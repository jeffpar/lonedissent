MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

now in 76-120, United States against Martin Linen Supply
Company.

May I say to counsel in this case and the other

cases scheduled for today, Mr. Justice Rehnquist is unavoidably
absent due to illness but reserves the right to participation,
consideration, and decision of these cases on the basis of
the entire record, including the tap© recording of th©
oral argument.
Mr. Easterbrook, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK II. EASTERBROOK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EASTERBROOK;
pleas© the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it.

The question

presented by this case is

whether the double jeopardy clause procludes th© Government
from appealing an order terminating the

prosecution but

entered after a mistrial had been declared because th© jury
was unable to agree upon a verdict.
This case began when the United States filed a
civil antitrust, complaint against respondents, their president,
and a third linen supply corporation.

The parties soon

agreed upon a consent decree, and the consent decree was
entered in th© summer of 1969.
■ In 1971, the United States filed petitions charging

4
respondents and their president with civil and criminal
contempt of that consent decree»

The petitions allege that

respondents threatened other linen supply firms with
retaliation if they engaged in competition.

The petitions

also allege that respondents made good their threats.
The district court entered an order holding that
the allegations did not sufficiently charge a violation of
the consent decree.
of appeals reversed.

The United States appealed and the court
It held that although respondents are

entitled to engage in vigorous competition, they are not
entitled to do so on a selective or retaliatory basis or to
make threats to competitors.

In other words, the court of

appeals held competition must b@ directed to consumers and
that threats of reprisals directed to competitors were
inconsistent with the consent, decree.
On remand in the district court, a jury trial was
held on the criminal contempt charges.

The Government

introduced testimony from a former employee of respondents
and from respondents' competitors demonstrating that
respondents threatened officers of competitors with retaliation
if they persisted in competing.

If a competitor did not

desist, respondents mounted a competitor-specific sales
campaign, that is, instead of soliciting all potential users
of linen supply services, they directed their sales efforts
towards making low-price offers to the customers of the

5

particular offending comp@fci.fcor»

They also made -threats

to competitors in fch® hops that these threats and the
retaliatory sales campaigns taken together would stave off
competition by making it more costly.
At the end of trial fch© jury returned a verdict of
not guilty with respect to respondents* president, Mr, Troy,
who had not bean linked personally with any of fch© threats.
Th® jury announced that it was hopelessly deadlocked with
respect to respondents, although it stood 11 to 1 in favor
of conviction.

The judge declared a mistrial without

objection, and he dismissed the jury.
Ths judge then invited motions for judgments of
acquittal.

Hs expressed dissatisfaction with ths consent,

decree stating that respondents had been improvident in
accepting its strictures.

lie also stated that h© believed

th© evidence introduced by th® Government was inadequate.
Respondents accepted

th® invitation and six days

later they filed motions for judgments of acquittal.
Approximately two months later th© judge granted both of those
motions without writing an opinion.
appealed for a second time.

Th© United States

It argued in essence that the

testimony at trial established the allegations of the contempt
petitions.

Because fch© court of appeals had held on the

first appeal that proof of threats and retaliatory sales
campaigns would demonstrate a violation of th© consent decree,

6
w© argued that, the district, court* s grant of a judgment of
acquittal notwithstanding at least prima faci© proof of
threats and retaliatory sales 'campaigns
QUESTION:

ypur view,

—

Mr. Ecisterbrook,

assume

at tli© stage of trial that the jury announced it was deadlocked,
was there authority in the judge to at that point direct a
verdict of acquittal?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, directed verdicts of

acquittal by th® jury ware abolished by Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 29(&),.and therefore, in our view, h® did not
have such authority.
QUESTION:

lie had no authority at that stag© to

terminate the proceedings by an acquittal?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
acquittal.

Not by a directed verdict of

II© did have th© authority at that stag® to

terminate the proceedings by entering a judgment of acquittal
on his own which would represent his view that th® evidence
taken in th© light most favorable to the Government, together
with all of its legitimate inferences, was insufficient to make
out a case for the jury, although in this cas© he did not do
that.

Instead, he allowed the jury to continue its delibera­

tions and eventually discharged them, and he did not enter
judgments of acquittal until two months and fiv© days later.
QUESTION:

But the motion was filed within seven

days as provided by Ru.l® 29 (c) .

7
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION;

Y@s , it was, your Honor.

That was a motion for judgment of

acquittal.
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yas,

And that motion was granted.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

It was, indeed.

And we think

that that, kind of decision can be appealed.
QUESTION:

I know you do.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

But before I com© to that, I

would like to discuss two issues that are lurking in th©
background of this cas® but that we think th© Court need not
address.

Th© first of these issues is whether the ipubl©

Jeopardy clause applies to corporations.

Both respondents

are corporations, and unless the Double Jeopardy Claus©
applies to them in a way that creates principles of finality
more stringent than those of res judicata, there could be no
bar to a second trial here.
I will not discuss that issue here, however, because
it was not raised by the parties in th© court of appeals, and
the court, of appeals did not discuss it.

The issue is

squarely presented, however, in United States’v. Security
National Bank, in which a petition for a writ of certiorari
is pending.

Th© United States believes that the Court should

address that issue in Security Bank, but that it is not
necessary to do so in this cas©.

8

The second issue I will not discuss at length is
the effect of raid-trial terminations, whether they are called
judgments of acquittal or orders dismissing the indictment.
We have discussed that problem at pages 12 to 19 of our
brief, and we have shown that there is no absoluta bar to a
reprosecution unless the jury returns a verdict of acquittal.
When a defendant requests a mid-trial termination, ha has
exercised his right to control th® conduct of feha proceedings
and has voluntarily surrendered his right to receive th©
verdict of th© jury.

In such cases, no less than in cases

in which th© mid-trial termination is called a mistrial, likes
United -States v. Dinits;, the Double jeopardy cl&us© does not
bar th© second trial.
QUESTION.

Th® argument in your brief under (a) would

cover a mid-trial termination.
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would, your Honor.

It is only th© argument under (b) that

would cover this case, but not a mid-trial.
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

You ar® abandoning th© argument under (a)?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
that argument.

That’s correct.

W© ar© not at all abandoning

Our argument is, in th© last analysis, that

only a verdict of acquittal by th© jury is

an absolute bar

to a retrial.
QUESTION:

Than you ar© talking about a mid-trial

9

termination.
MR. EASTERBROOKs

But w© don’t believe it is

necessary to reach that question —
QUESTION:

If we accept your argument (a),we have

reached fch® question, haven’t
MR. EASTERBROOKs

and decided it?

That is correct.

But I think it

is more appropriate for me to make here at greater length
the'

narrower arguments that would avoid the necessity to

reach that particular on®,

although I will say that the

mid-trial termination problem has recently received a
thoughtful and very thorough analysis in a case called
?

United Statas v. Senobria decided by the First Circuit on
i. ’• .

j. .

' .

December 2 9.
QUESTION:

That is involved in the Brown case, isn’t

it?
MR. EASTERBROOKs
QUESTION s

The sam® issue is involved —

Petition for certiorari is pending here?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

Yes,, your Honor,

itils the same issue.

This case, however, simply does not involve a mid­
trial termination.

The case went to completion and ended i.n

a mistrial when th© jury was unable to reach a verdict.

The

difficult questions presented by midtrial terminations
therefor® need not, be resolved here.
In our view, a single simple principle controls
this case.

It *s a principle that has been accepted sine© fir.

10

Justice Story’s opinion for th® Court in 1824 in United Stat®s
Vo Pares.

The principle is this:

The declaration of a

mistrial because the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict
removes any double jeopardy objection to a second trial,,

One®

the jury has reached an impasse, th® judge is entitled to set
the case for a second trial because of manifest necessity.
We do not understand respondents to quarrel with
this, and if th® district court may set the case for a
second trial without offending the Double Jeopardy Clause,
then the court of appeals may direct th© district court to do
so.

This follows, we believe, from United States v. Sanford

decided by this Court on October 12 of last year.

In that

case th© Court held that th© Double Jeopardy Claus® does not
bar review of orders entered after a mistrial has been
declared terminating the prosecution, even though in Sanford
the. order was based in substantial part on evidence that was
heard at trial and even though in Sanford th© district court,
concluded that the evidence at trial showed 'that respondents
had a complete defense to th© charges against them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, before you get too

d@©ply into th® double jeopardy argument, don’t you have a
statutory problem?

What, is the statutory language that

supports the appeal from a judgment of acquittal?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Our statutory authority is th®

first paragraph of 'th® Criminal Appeals Act.

We acknowledge

11

that th© statutory authority doss not spaak in terms of
judgments of acquittal, but that language was thoroughly
analysed in United States v. Wilson, and the Court held in
Wilson that Congress intended to authorize appeals from orders
terminating the prosecution unless those appeals were barred
by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

In Wilson itself the car©

had gone to the jury and thereafter the judge entered an
order -that h© denominated a judgment of acquittal.

And thsre

was an argument made by respondents in Wilson that we lacked
statutory authority to appeal.

The Court rejected that

argument in Wilson: and we think the reasoning in Wilson
is dispositive hare.
QUESTION:

In Wilson didn't the Court in effect

hold that it was a dismissal of to© indictment?
MR. KASTERBRQOK:

The Court held that it didn’t

make any differens©, I think.

That analysis is at pages 347

or 348 to 351 of Wilson, and what th© judge called it was
simply immaterial.

Th© salient factor was that it terminated

th© prosecution in favor of th© defendant, and that was the
fact, that triggered the right to appeal under the first
paragraph of th© Act.
We think our double jeopardy proposition also
follows quit© strongly from United States v. Jam in 400 U.S.
In Jom the district court declared a mistrial in mid-trial.
Then it dismissed th® indictment later, concluding that th©

12
Double Jeopardy Claus® would bar a second trial.
Court entertained an appeal from that decision.

This
It ultimately

held that the district court was right and 'that the Double
■k

Jeopardy Claus® did bar a second trial, because th© declaration,
of a mistrial in mid-trial amounted to judicial overreaching.
But the Court clearly implied that if the declaration of a
mistrial had been proper, then it also would have been
proper far this Court to have reversed and remanded for a
second trial.

As th® Court said in that case, at page 476,

“This trial ruling contemplates reprosecution." And so it
is hers.
Th® court of appeals has the pow@r to remand for
a sscond trial.

The Doubl® Jeopardy Clausa doss not bar th®

way because it was proper to declare a mistrial on account
of jury disagreement, and th® jury’s inability to agr®a
removed th® bar to a second trial,
QUESTION;
as I remember,

In th® Jorn case, th® district court,

had dismissed th® indictment because ha

thought that a new trial was not permissible under the
Double Jeopardy Claus©.
MR. EASTERBROOK;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

And that was ultimately affirmed by

tills Court.
In this case, by contrast, th© district judge
entered a judgment of acquittal, not because of any views*about:

13
•fob© Double Jeopardy Clausa,, but bacaus© of his views of the
casa on the merits.
MR. EASTEKBRQQKs

Yes, your Honor.

What I was

using Jom for was to demonstrate the proposition that the
mere fact that a second trial would follow a reversal on
appeal is not necessarii/ an independent double jeopardy bar»
if the Double Jeopardy Clausa doesn't bar that second trial.
In Jorn the argument was that the Double Jeopardy Claus©
would not bar the second ferial because the declaration of the
mistrial had bean proper.
QUESTION:

And that argument was ultimately

rejected.
MR. EASTSRBROOK:

Right.

Her® feh© argument is

that the Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar the second
ferial because the declaration of a mistrial because of jury
disagreement was clearly proper, and respondents don't
disagree.
QUESTION:

Her© the argument i3 -- I don't know

whose argument you ar® talking about.

Here your opponents*

argument is that feh© Double Jeopardy Clausa bars a new ferial
because there has been a judgment of acquittal,of not guilty.
MR. EASTSRBROOK:

Right.

And that presents the

question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause independently
bars review of the judge's findings, even if the second ferial
would not by itself violat® fell® clause.

The defense was governmental

If we had not appealed that order in Sanford, the
/

But we did appeal, and this Court held

QUESTION;

i

But rule 29(c), what was tha purposes of

15
MR, E AS TE RB ROOK:

Rul® 29(c) was to bring proceedings)

to a closes in the case the Government did not have a case.
I would lik© to make on® tiling quite clear in case
there is any misunderstanding.

We do not contend that a

second trial should bs held automatically after there is a
mistrial declared.

There may b© reasons in particular cases

why a second tiial should not b® hsld.

In the present case,

for example, if the evidence was in fact insufficient as th®
judge believed, it is quite appropriate for the district court
to enter a judgment of acquittal, and that would b@ the end
of th© case absent appellate review.
*

QUESTION z

At what point precisely did th® district

judge do that?
MR. EASTERBROQKs

Th® district judge has power

under rul© 29(c) to enter a judgment of acquittal at any time
during th® trial when the motion is mad® and on a motion
made within seven days after trial.

So the district judge's

order in this case was clearly within his power.
h©ver contended otherwise.

We have

So was the order in Sanford

clearly within the judge's power to enter.

There is no doubt

that h® had the power to do exactly what h® did.

Th© question

is whether fee erred in doing so, and if he erred, whether
an appeal lies to correct that error.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Easterbrook, you told us in th©

beginning ‘that in entering th© order the district court, wrote

16
no opinion.

But I can't even find a copy of the order.

MR. EASTERBROGK:

A copy of the order is in our

petition for writ of certiorari.

It’s at pages
They ar© both

And in both of those

orders , the judge recites that fch© reasons stated in the
motions for judgments of acquittal ara good and valid and
that further this defendant is not guilty.
QUESTION:

H© uses the phras© "not guilty/’ doesn't

h©?
MR. EASTERBROGK:
QUESTION:

That is right.

Mr. Eastarbrook, would you b© mailing

the same argument if there hadn't been a mistrial, that the
judge had just exercised his power to enter a judgment of
acquittal whan the jury reported that they wer© deadlocked?
MR. EASTERBROGK:
QUESTION;

Y©s, your Honor.

That would be the mid-trial sort of

thing?
MR. EASTERBROGK:

Our position is that one© the

jury deadlocks, ths fact of the deadlock is the manifest
necessity to create th© right to a second trial.

Whether

the judge says th© formal words, "I declare a mistrial,” is
quit© unimportant in our view.

It's a functional analysis

17
rather than a formal on,©* and fch@ important function, in this
case is th© jury was unabl© feo agree, -that the first trial
had essentially coma to naught.

Then the question is whether

th© Double Jeopardy Claus© after the first trial had coma to
naught bars a second trial, and w© think not.

For that

purpose it makes no difference whether th© judge says, "I
grant a mistrial."
QUESTION:

You told us that the Federal Rules have

abolished th© directed verdict of acquittal, but up until
recently ther© was such a thing as a directed verdict of
acquittal, and had th© district judges don© that when th®
jury reported they were deadlocked, had h© then, on motion,
or without motion, said, "I have considered all the evidence
and I hereby direct you to reach a verdict of acquittal,"
that functionally would be precisely th© same as this case,
wouldn't it?
MR. EASTERBROOKs
QUESTION•

No, it would not, your Honor.

Why?

MR, EA5TERBR00K:

Th® difference is this:

Suppos®

the jury had com® back and said that it was deadlocked, and
tli® judge, instead of saying, Bl direct you to return a
verdict of acquittal," had given an outrageously erroneous
instruction at that point, had said —
QUESTION:

Let's stick with my cas© first and thon

you can give me all th® other hypotheticals you want.

18

MR» EASTERBROOK:

I think your cas© is the cas© in

which ‘tit© judge sends the jury out to consider under
outrageously erroneous instructions.

The instruction is

the defendants ar© not guilty, return a verdict of acquittal.
QUESTION s

This is after the jury comes back and

says, "We are deadlocked, we can't reach a verdict," and the
judge says, "Well, there was an earlier motion of acquittal
and I have had it undor consideration, and I now direct you
to reach a verdict of acquittal."
MR. EASTERBROOK s

And he sends the jury out to do

that.
QUESTION:

Whenever h© does it generally.

He used

to do it in open court, back in my experience.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

At that point our argument is

the same as the argument here.
QUESTION:
of acquittal.

In our view it is —

Even though it's a directed jury verdict

Why isn't that the Fong Foo cas©?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Tha Fong Foo cas® was a cas&

in which that happened in raid-trial before the jury said it
was unable to agree.

So you had no idea in Fong Foo whether

th© jury was favorably disposed to defendants, whether the
jury would evaluate the prosecution’s evidence in- such a
way that it did not credit the prosecution's witnesses,
?

as Judge Wizanski in Fong Foo had said that he did not.
judge’s instruction in raid-trial in Fong Foo deprived th©

The

19

defendants of tfoair opportuni fey to receive that verdict from
the jury.

But in the hypothetical you gave, the cas© went

unencumbered to th® jury.

The jury cart® back and said, "W© ans

deadlocked? we can’t agree."

And at that point w@ think tea

manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial ~
QUESTION:

No, no, no.

My hypothesis is that th®

jury doesn’t agree and th© judge at that point says, "Well, I
am going to direct you to enter a verdict of acquittal."
MR. E AS TE RB ROOK:

It’s our view, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that what happens after the jury is unable to agree is, for
double jeopardy purposes, immaterial.

That’s what I thought, even though it’s

It's answerable, isn't it?

MR. EASTERSROOK;

-— it deprives fch® defendant of

QUESTION;

He hasn't been deprived of that if h©

gets a directed verdict.
QUESTION;

What verdict of the jury has he got here?

He hasn't gotten any verdict of the jury her®.
MR. SASTBRBROOK;

That is correct, because th©

jury was unable to r©ach a vardtct, and that is the same in
any mistrial case.
QUESTION;

So the difference is that the jury has

reported it is unable to agree. That takes it out of 29(c).
MR. EAS TE RB ROOK;

No, your Honor. In our view

29(c) is perfectly applicable, and th© judge was quit©

In my hypothetical case, defendants hav®

MR. EASTERBROOKs

Your Honor, in our view, w@

probably cannot appeal that judgment, if th® defendants

QUESTION:

Right.

But what did th® defendant do

her©?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

There am two differences.

could analyse his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal
as a position at that time» " I am now going to waive th©
jury and ask th® judge for a judgment."
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Unless th® prosecution agrees to

do that--the prosecution also has a right to have th© cas®
go to jury.

This is what it held in Singer.

We have indeed

relied on Singer in this cas®.
QUESTIONS

You have?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

Yes, w@ have.

I would. Ilk® to discuss briefly th© cas© of th©
United States v. Wilson, which 1 think addresses some of the
•fellings I have been discussing with Mr. Justic® Stewart and
Mr. Justice Marshall.

In Wilson the Court returned a verdict

25

of guilty, and th© judges then entered a judgment of
acquittal, which h© called a judgmsnt of acquittal based
on th© evidence that was heard at trial.

Th© court held that

such a judgment can bo reviewed and reversed, and the fact
that it is called an acquittal is irrelevant.

The Court

summarized this in United Statas v. Jenkins*, 420 U.S. at pag®
365v by saying that when "th© jury returns a verdict of
guilty,but th© trial court thereafter enters a judgment of
acquittal, an appeal is permitted."

In other words, nothing

in th© Double Jeopardy Clause bars appellat© review of the
judgaEs decision to acquit the defendants, even based on
evidence at trial, because we understand that to be th©
import of the statement in Jenkins.
QUESTION?

Mr. Eastarbrook, I have to interrupt you

because you had called

my attention to the Wilson cas®, and

the court describes the order of the district court as a
dismissal of ill© indictment in two or three places in the
beginning of th® opinion.

Where do you find it was a judgment

of acquittal?
MR. EASTERSROOK:

Your Honor, th© judgment entered

in Wilson was denominated by th© judge as a judgment of
acquittal.

But everybody agrees now that it was

in function an order dismissing the indictment, whereas in
this case, in function wa have an order acquitting the

But I can go beyond Wilson, I

think, because in United States v. Sanford w© hav® the same
problem w® hav® her®.

In Sanford the judge entered an order

saying that the defendants had a perfect d@£@ns@, and on that
account h© dismissed the indictment.

But the argument on

the other side was, although that was called a dismissal
of 'the indictment, it was really in function an acquittal,

That depends on whether in function th©

is a dismissal or an acquittal.

But how can you

MR. EASTERBROOK;

W@ can say, I think, your Honor,

that Congress intended in th© Criminal Appsals Act to remove
all nonconstitutional bars to appeal from final orders

terminating the prosecution.

The Congress used language

that it thought encompassed all of those categories of
final orders terminating prosecution.

And although it didn’t

us® the particular language, under the interpretation of
that statute in Wilson, which goes back to the legislative
history, Congress intended its language to be broad enough
to cover this case.
QUESTION: .Well, find maybe Congress rightly
thought that a judgment of acquittal could not b@ appealed
because a retrial would h© barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause.

That may be th® reason it didn’t use that phras®.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Stevens.

One more point, Mr. Justice

This Third Circuit in Wilson had held as a matter

of law that the judgment in that cass was in fact an
acquittal and not a dismissal of th© indictment, that it was
an acquittal in both form and function.
QUESTION:

I understand all that.

But how do you

get over the fact that in this case in function it's an
acquittal.

What ©Is© do you do when th© evidence off©rad by

th© Government is insufficient to support th© charge?

The

man is entitled to an acquittal, isn't he?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

That's functionally what happened here.

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Y©s, your Honor.

And w® don’t disput© that.

You say some acquittals can be appealed,

29
and there is no authority that you have cited yet that
supports teat proposition, is there?
MR, EASTERBROOK 5

I think Sanford supports teat

proposition, absolutely, because in function th© judgmant in
Sanford was an acquittal.

It was an order based on th©

evidence at trial holding that the defendants had committed
no crime, and th® Court held that we could appeal in Sanford.
Wilson supports that not because th© order in Wilson was
in function an acquittal based on insuffiency of th© evidence
but because of the Court’s analysis of th© legislative history
and the intent of Congress to permit appeals whenever th®
Double Jeopardy Claus© would not bar them.

And teat leaves,

in our view, only the constitutional issue in this case.
QUESTION:

That must ba the equivalent under the old

Criminal Appeals Act of th© judgment notwithstanding th®
verdict, was it not?

I forget tecs name

of it, that was

involved in teat case, where the indictment, in effect,
didn't charge- a crime, taking all tee ovidenc® into considera­
tion.
MR, EASTERBROOKs

It was not a eas® where th©

indictment didn’t charge a crime.

Th® indictment charged

a crime in Wilson, but the Court found teat there were other
reasons outside the indictment and completely apart from th®

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BURLESON SMITH ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SMITHi
th© Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it plsase

Thera is a narrow and a limited constitutional

question involved here , and X confess to th© Court that much
has b©©n written about th© problem of double jeopardy, both
before and after the 1370 amendment.

I won't suggest to the

Court that everything that has been written in th© ®.r@a is
consistent, nor will I suggest to th© Court that there is a
single case handled by this Court in which there has been a
dispositive ruling, a ruling on facts on all squares with
ours.

I do suggest, however, that precedents and th© policy

of th© Administration of Criminal Justice both support th©
affirmance of the judgments below.
Turning first fc© the precedents, of course th©
fountainhead of all decisions or all considerations in a
case like this is Mr. Justice Story's opinion in th© Par©a
cas© in 1824.

That cas® ordinarily is cited for his words

about the prisoner has been neither.convicted nor acquitted,
and therefor© may ba put to his defense.

Similarly th®

Words "manifest necessity,” th© words of "ends ©f public
justice," but I com® after those words to th® words that I

31
think ax*© really -- now, this is back in 1824 — ar© really
those that ar® applicable h@r® after talking about th®
discretion to b© ®x@rcis®d by the trial judge, and you remember
that Peres, was a hung jury cas®

and was a capital case, and .

the question was what was th© trial judge's power at that time.
Mr. Justice Story said, "But after all, they (the
judges) have th© right to order the discharge,and th© security
which th® public has for th® faithful, sound, and conscientious
@x@rcis@ of this discretion rests in this as in other cases
upon th® responsibility of th© judges under their oaths of
office." Now, that, it s®@ms to m@, is what w® hav© today
is to determine what the trial judge's function is in a case
and haw h® exercised that function in 'this cas®.
Th© Perea cas®, of course, has been cited down
•through 1976 by this Court.

Perhaps on© of th® most pertinent

observations about it was of this Court in Wad® v. Hunter
wh@r© it was pointed out that the value of th® Perea principles
thus lies in th© capacity for informed application under
widely different circumstances without injury to defendants or
to the public interest.

That, after all, is th® resolution

that, needs to b© mad® in this and any other cas© involving
th© administration of criminal justice.,

th© resolution of th©

problem, th® public interest, on th© on© hand, th© private
interest of th® individuals on th© other hand.

for this Court in the Sisson cas®.

much has been written about that.

As you know*,

But Hr» Justice Harlan

for this Court said then, in the Sisson case, that judges,
lik© juries, can acquit defendants and cited specifically
rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Then in Illinois v. SoraarvillQ, this Court again
recently, speaking through Mr. Justice Rahnquist for the
majority, Mr. Justice White for the dissent, both acknowledged
the applicability ©f the Perea rules, both acknowledged the
flexibility of the rule of Perez that th@r@ is no fixed,
mechanical formula, but rather that broad discretion is
reserved to the trial judg©.
Mow, that is what rul© 29(c) actually do©s.

It

gives broad discretion t© the trial judge, and the judg® her©
exercised that discretion.

Similarly, in other cases,

rule 29 cases, the trial judg© has exercised that discretion
Similarly, particularly the Suarez case out of the Second

So what w@ have are three circuit courts, th®

under rul© 29.

How, counsel for the Government, neither in

brief nor in oral argument, has cited a single cas® from a

th© Government's position her®.

Th© Government8s position

opinions by this Court, ha had a trial judge take it away

And this Court held that there

was no right of appeal by the Government.
I r@it@rafc® that neither in oral argument or in

its support.
Now, w©

corn© —

you can't get into the precedent

in this matter without getting to th© famous trilogy of
Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass.

Your Honors, of course, know

much mor© about those cases -than I would presume to know.
Wilson was appealable because, as the Court said, there was
a guilty verdict entered by the jury.
QUESTION3

Mr. Smith, before you get to those cases,

just so I know what your answer to this question is when you
are discussing those other cases, suppose the jury returns
a verdict of guilty and within seven days the judge enters
an order of acquittal.

Now, I take it your submissiori is that

even though there wouldn't ba a necessity for any new trial
afterwards, that the mere fact of acquittal seals the case
and it is unappealable,
MR. SMITH;
that.

Your Honor, X am not going to suggest

On© of the casas recently said there is no talismarxic

quality in the word '’acquittal."
QUESTIONs

So you are not saying, then, I take it.

35
that just th® fact that the judge has done what the rules
entitle him to do, namely, enter a judgment of acquittal
based on tha evidence, automatically forbids the appeal.
MR. SMITH:

I am not saying rule 29 arises to

QUESTION;

of any
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

Now I would like to have those cases.
W® have taken the position, and I think

it is perfectly supportable, that Jenkins is ‘the controlling
case.

I particularly direct your Honors' attention to

footnote 7 in that cas© where Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if you
will remember, had before him the dissenting position taken by

36

Judge Lombard out of fch© Second Circuit.

Judg© Lombard was

relying on such cases as 11 linois v. Som®rvi 1 la, and I4r.
Justice Rohnquisfc said Judg® Lombard analogized respondent1s
cas® to mistrial cases in which fch® public interest in fair
trials designed to end in just judgments must b© weighed.
That interest, he felt, would not be served by parraitting a
clearly guilty defendant to go fro© because of an erroneous
interpretation of the controlling law.

Speaking for this

Court, Mr. Justice Bahnquist said, ”W© dieagree with this
analysis because we think it is of critical importance whether
the proceedings in fch© trial court terminate in a mistrial,
as they did in the Somerville lin© of cases, or in the
defendant's favor as they did hare."

In other words, feher® was

a judgment of acquittal in favor of the defendant.

And, of

course, that is the same case in which, speaking for this
Court very recently, Mr. Justice Relinquish also said — and
this gets to the heart of fch© double jeopardy question -Her© there was a judgment discharging fch® defendant, although
w® cannot say with assurance whether it was or was not a
resolution of the factual issues against the Goveraitiafe.

But

it is enough for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Claus®, and
therefor© for tha determination of appealability under 3731*
that further proceedings of some sort devoted to the resolution
of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged
v7ould have bosn required upon reversal and remand.

37
An ironic part about this case is that this is
a criminal contempt case.

Criminal contempt, any contempt,

of course, is a charge of flaunting or denigrating feh© power,
authority, and dignity of a court.

Her© th© court against

whom the contempt was supposed to hav© been directed has
found absolutely and in unequivocal language that th®
defendants ar@ not guilty, that tbs Government has failed to
discharge its burden, th® defendants are not guilty, using
those words, if you pittas®, Mr. Justice Stewart, and that
th©y should for teat reason be acquitted, and they were
acquitted.
Mow, Serfass.

Serfass is simply a pretrail

And as feh® Chief Justice suggested, that r©ally

is a test of feh© sufficiency of th© indictment.
So also is Sanford.

Sanford is clearly, just as

this Court held in December of this last year, is simply a
pretrial dismissal.

Admittedly th© trial court said that tee

Government, had consented and thsrefor® whatever th® proof was
by feh® Government, th© defendants should hav® been discharged.
That did not come into feh® ferial where that evidence
was introduced and produced.

That ferial was long gone.

rule 29 motion appears in the report.

No

That trial was over.

But as an afterthought and before th® next ferial, the y©t-tocero® ferial, th® defendant filed a motion for dismissal on th®
ground teat the Government5 s evidence in a now completed trial

33

constituted a complet® bar.

This Court, quit© properly haId

that that was nothing but a pretrial dismissal.»
How# if fch© Court pi©as©, the authorities — or
it seems to me the precedent is clearly in support of the
position of the respondents her©, the two corporations, but
thar© is a. vary, very important consideration, a policy
consideration if feh@ Court please.

And that relates to the

fair accommodation between the proper administration of
criminal justice on. the public's behalf and an individual
defendant's right to finality of judgment.
I think this is what Mr. Justice Black was talking
about in Green v. United states, speaking for this Court of
course, that th© underlying idea, one that is deeply
engrained in at least the Anglo-Saxon system of jurisprudence,
#

is that th© stata with all its resources and power should not
be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict, an individual
for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrass­
ment, expense, and ordeal and compelling him to live in a
continuing state of anxiety and insecurity as well as
enhancing the possibility that even though innocent, he may
be found guilty.

In other words, when he is acquitted, he

is acquitted, and his trial is ov€*r.
how, the Government counsel has said frankly that
the question of whether or not corporations,and the only
parties before ‘this Court are corporations, are entitled to

39

the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clausa is a question
yet to be determined by this Court, and it will be determined
on appeal, if the Court takes it, from the Security National
Bank case out of the Second Circuit.

lie frankly said that

this is a determination that need not be made by this Court
in this case, but. that is a position, in all candor, that
the Government takes both in its brief for petition of cert
and also in its main brief in this Court.
On the other hand, I cite that case and the Second
Circuit's opinion in that case, to show that what Mr.
Justice Black said about the rights and the public policy
as to

individuals applies as well as to corporations.

And

in tills opinion, in December of 1976 , the Second Circuit,
the unanimous opinion, says, "Mo corporation, large or small,
can escape the incalculable effect which a conviction may
have on the public attitude toward the company.

Like an

individual, it must answer to the verdict of the community.
No corporation, no matter how large, can pit its resources
against the overwhelming might of the state so as to avoid
the harassment and the increasing probability of conviction
resulting from reprosecution.

In 'this unequal contest" —

and these are the court's words — "In this unequal contest
1 fundamental fairness' requires that the Government,having
had a full try at establishing criminal wrongdoing, shall
not nave another,

The appeal is dismissed."

40

How, let's turn those considerations to what we have
hare.

Let's look at the facts of our case.

First of all,

counsel didn't mention that the 1969 consent, decree was
entered into and negotiated after extended grand jury
proceedings, considerable time, expense, effort.

The decree

was entered in 1971. Less than two years later we were faced
with ex parte show-cause orders for both criminal and civil
contempt.

We had bean negotiating, or had been with them

for at least three years, but these were entered ax parta
by the Government, at ‘the Government's motion.
Then w© were faced with a prior appeal on the motion
to construe.

We lost that.

This Court refused cert.

And

after that we had extensive discovery on both the criminal
and the civil contempt, discovery running in tandem, in
addition to

discovery under th© omnibus procedure which

prevails in our district.
trial of this case.

And then in 1975 we got to the

And I think it’s very important for this

Court t.o know the comments of the trial judge — and these are
all in ~bhe appendix.

First of all, the Government's position

in the trial, as shown on page 31 and 32, clearly shows that
what it is trying to do is prosecute an industry,and we just
happened to be the lucky target,for the disruptive practices
that the Government talks about in ‘the industry.

We are the

one — the only one, as the record shows — against which any
charges like this have been made.

41
QUESTION:

The marits of your case, or the

Government!s case, are not really before us here, are they?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir, but these all go to the

judge's comments, that are in the appendix, which show the
state of mind of the judge when he found not guilty and
acquitted.
QUESTION:

But your position is that even if the

judge — when pressed, your position would be that even if
the judge was quite wrong in entering the judgment of
acquittal, nonetheless it's not appealable.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's Fong Foo, if the Court please.
Exactly, and that has to ba your

position.
MR. SMITH:
very clearly.

Yes, your Honor.

Fong Foo says that

I think the whole Court thought, they

probably thought th,© trial judge in Fong Foo had done some­
thing

improvidently in dismissing or bringing to an end that

particular litigation.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But th© fact is that the Court held —

Thera was an acquittal.
There was an acquittal and that no appeal

should lie.
QUESTION:

Right.

And th© fact really that this was

a criminal contempt rather -than a min® run, plain vanilla
criminal case doesn't have anything basically to do with th®
issu® before us, does it?

42
MR. SMITH:

I til ink not, if the Court pleas©.

I

think the Fifth Circuit determined that in the prior appeal
and said that criminal contempt
here is

for purposes of our problem

—
QUESTION:

This case has been argued just as though

ix, were a mine run, general prosecution on both sides, hasn't
it?
MR. SMITH:

That's right.

A run of the mill. . And

that, of course, is on® factor that shows the comprehensive
effect of the Court's ruling in this case, is because there is
no real reason that it shouldn't apply to other cases except
for the fact that you have the judge finding

he is the one

against whom th© contempt is supposed to have teen — he
is th© —
QUESTION:

Well, that is a special little circumstance

of this case, but it doesn't really affect the basic issue
here, does it?
MR. SMITH:

I think on that we would have to say

that whatever distinctions you could make would be hard to
withstand.
Then the trial court said -- and this indicates
that when ha dismissed th© jury, h© didn't, intend to terminate
this trial.

He made soma remarks from the bench, and he

said, "I am open to any motion that sitter sids would like to
file.”

That's page 33 of the appendix.

Then, on that same

43

page, h© told the Government,, "I think you have had your day
in court on the criminal contempt»

I gave you ©very oppor­

tunity to convict these defendants, and you came very close
on the corporate defendants, but you didn't come close on
the individual»

I would be inclined to bring this thing to

an end at this time;" saying to the Government, "You shot your
best shot and you didn’t kill anybody, you didn’t sustain
your burden; I find the defendants not guilty, and I acquit
them."

This is getting over to the time when he enters

orders.
QUESTION:

He had two other opportunities to say

the same thing, didn’t h@?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

You mean earlier?
Yes, at th© close of the Government’s

cas©, and he did not.
MR. SMITH:

He did not.

He gave the Government

full opportunity, and th© Fifth Circuit says this in its
opinion.

II© gave the Government full opportunity to shoot

everything they had.

They shot it» And we made th© motion

at th® end of the Government’s case; we mad© the motion to
acquit at th© end of the whole case.

«■

But now this rule 29 -QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

It convinced 11 jurors, though, didn’t it?
Yes, it did.

In all candor, that is

one reason we don’t want them to have another shot.

44
But also th® Government has got. another shot even
after this, because what Judge Wood, th© trial judga, was
saying, he said, "Let's gat on with the civil contempt.
get on."

Let's

It's still pending, and there is nothing that the

Government could get in this criminal contempt by way of
penalty that it can't also get in the civil contempt which
is presently pending in the trial court.
Now, what did the trial court say when he entered
his judgment of acquittal?
April 22, 1975.

Now, each of these is dated

There is a separate judgment of acquittal

as to each corporat® defendant. "Th© court finds that the
grounds set forth in that motion are good and valid and that
the Government has failed to prove the material allegations
beyond a reasonable doubt,that further this defendant should
ba found not guilty.

It is accordingly adjudged that

respondent Martin Linen Supply Company is not guilty of the
charges against it and is hereby acquitted and discharged as
to all charges herein."

That, is the judge's order and his

opinion.
Th© circuit court, th© Fifth Circuit, of course,
held that ther© was no appealability and no appeal available
to th© Government, and it is our position, of course, that
each of those judgments, or the judgments of both courts
below,should be affirmed.
Now, if it's not affirmed, if those judgments are

45
not affirmed, how are wa going to describe the function of
a trial judge in the trial of a criminal case?

Judge

Simpson, on the panel of the Fifth Circuit that heard the
argument, an old trial judge, asked Government counsel, he
said, "What difference is th@re between th© acquittal under
these circumstances and the acquittal under the circumstances
of Robbins whersi the Court took it away from the jury at th©
©nd of th© Government's case?”

The Government had no

satisfactory answer to th® court.

Judge Dyer, also an old

experienced trial judge, also on th© panel, said, "Counsel,
you would have a good argument if there wasn't anybody in
that courtroom but you and the jury.

But what are you going

to attribute to the trial judge?"
I suggest, if the Court please, that unless this
trial court’s judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule 29,
which had all of the effect of extending this trial in which
this judgment of acquittal was entered, in which this evidence
was entered and introduced, quit® contrary to Sanford, that
unless this judgment of acquittal is sustained and affirmed,
th® trial judg® for practical purposes will be sterilised
