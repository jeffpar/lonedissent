W©811 hear arguments

first this morning in 76-415,, Ward against Illinois®
Mr® Beckett, you may proceed whenever you're ready®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J® STEVEN BECKETT, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BECKETT:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is an appeal from a decision of the
Illinois Supreme Court affirming the defendant's conviction
after a bench trial under the Illinois Obscenity Statute®
The defendant was tried in March of 1972, and he was charged
under a complaint by a police officer with offering to sell
and selling two allegedly obscene magazines t "Bizarre World"
end "Illustrated Case Histories".
His conviction was affirmed by the Illinois Appellate
Court for the Third District, and the case* was then appealed
by Petition for Leave to Appeal to the Illinois. Supreme Court®
That court considered the ©is©, after it had
considered a case called People vs® Ridens or Ridens II, which
was a case on 'the remand from this Court in 1973, which was
decided at, th© Sana time of Miller vs® California®
In Ridens II# the Illinois Supreme Court, on the
remand, held that th® Illinois Obscenity Statute was still
constitutional, even in light of this Court's decision in

4
Miller vs. California.,
The defendant attacked the validity of the Illinois
Obscenity Statute under principles announced in Miller vsc
California, and that attack was rejected by the Illinois
Supreme Court in an opinion below.
The court also held that the publications at issue
in this case were not protected under the First Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States»
While his case was pending in the Illinois Supreme
Court, a three-judge federal court was convened in Chicago to
consider the identical argument concerning the constitutionality
of the Illinois Obscenity Statute.
On May 14, the Illinois Supreme Court announced its
decision in People vs. Ward below.
On May 28th, after having the opportunity to review
the opinion of People vs. Ward, that three-judge federal court
held tho Illinois Obscenity Statute unconstitutional and
entered a permanent injunction against its enforcement, in a
case entitled

Eagle Books vs. Rainhard.

QUESTIONs

Has the Illinois Legislature mad® any

changes in 'She Illinois law since the Miller decision?
MR. BECKETT:

The Illinois Legislature enacted a

,law that was vetoed, that would have changed the definition
of obscenity under Killer; but that law was vetoed.

So the

practical effect is there has been no change in the Illinois

5
Obscenity —
QUESTIONs

There has* in fact* been no change®

MR» BECKETT:

There, in fact, has been no change»

The --QUESTION:

I suppose not every State needs to change

its statutes because of Miller? is that true?
MR® BECKETT:

This Court, in Miller and also in —

in footnote 6 in Miller and also in United States vs» 12 200foot Reals of Film, indicated that existing obscenity laws,
as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well b© valid»
And in Ham ling,

the Court said that that statement meant that

we weren’t saying that all obscenity laws were unconstitutional?
but in announcing Miller, this Court said that State courts,
on the remand, must authoritatively construe those statutes®
As demonstrated in our briefs, many States hava don©
so, and, as such, have held their statutes constitutional.
QUESTION:

Has Illinois now construed its existing

s t&tuta?
MR» BECKETT:

Th© Illinois Supreme Court has

construed its statute, but in such a way as to not meet the
Court’s remand order in Miller»
In Ridens, the Court said that, in response to the
specificity attack, that the statuta as written, because it
defines prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in
nudity, sex or excretion, provide?.1 th© specificity that this

6

Court has required under Mi liar;, under part (b) »
That question was addressed by the three-judge
court and they rejected the State of Illinois' contention that
the Illinois Suprams Court in fact engrafted onto its statute
the examples of sexual conduct under part (b) that this Court
set forth in the Miller opinion»
Additionally# that Court noted that the Illinois
Supreme Court did not rely on prior judicial opinions# as so
many other States have done.»
In other words# this Court did not say in Millar what
an author!tative construction was»

But appellant submits to

the Court that an authoritative construction is fixing words
in the statute just as if the Legislature had. amended it# but
in this situation# based on prior decisions which had given a
limiting effect to the statute»
And in Illinois# that is not the case.
QUESTION:

How do you think your case is different

from People vs, Enskat# the way the California courts, treated
their obscenity statute?
MR» BECKETT:

In Enskat# the California Appellate

Court indicated that "our past decisions" — and they specifically
listed past decisions# and said that "our past decisions under
Section 311 of the California Penal Code have limited the
application of our statute to hardcore sexual conduct# and
that nudity is not proscribed” and some other rather definite

7
statements
The Illinois Supreme Court has never dona this»
QUESTION?

But your opposing counsel* at least*

contends that in earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of
Illinois similar limitations were placed on the Illinois
Statute„

You disagree with that?
MR® BECKETT:

Oh* I definitely disagree with that®

Moreover* the Illinois Supreme Court did not accept
that argument.
I think the decision —* the specific decision that
I think he is referring to is City of Chicago vs. Geraci* and
that Court's decision there has to be analogized to this
Court's decision in United States vs. Hamling.
This Court said* “our past decisions in considering
constitutional attacks on federal obscenity statutes and in
interpreting those statutes have given them a limited effect?
a limiting effect* that we then really codified in Mi.Her with
those examples„

And so we have no difficulty engrafting

Examples A and B onto those federal obscenity statutes? and
we said we were going to do so in United States vsa 12 200-foot
Reels of Film®”
However* the Illinois case* City of Chicago vsa Gsraoi*
was not interpreting the Illinois Obscenity Statute? as a
matter of fact* it was interpreting an ordinance of the City
of Chicago

8
And* secorid, the discussion that mentioned the
specific sexual conduct in that opinion was not talking about
an interpretation of the terra ^obscenity” or any derivative
thereof, it was talking about the constitutional status of
the publications»
QUESTION! Would it be your contention that either
the opinion in question or the text of the statute itself
must appeal to the prurient interest?
MR® BECKETT:

No„

The Geraci case, in fact,

demonstrates the problems that people such as the appellant
Ward and those in Illinois have in this situation» The
statute of the law in 1971, with respect to obscenity, as the
Court is well aware, is what Justice Brennan has called
hopeless confusion»
In this spacific Geraci case, the Illinois Supreme
Court took categories of publications and said, for example,
that the United States Supreme Court, in Central Magazine
Sales, has looked at publications similar to these and they
depict bondage, et cetera, and that Court said that no matter
what test you apply to obscenity, those publications are
entitled to constitutional protection; and therefore the
categories of magazines that we have here ar© protected under
the First Amendment.
Then the Court went on to consider a magazine, the
depictions of which era mentioned in -she State of Illinois*

9
brief? and said:

Well, w® can’t find any cases that are

exactly on this, but the United S Tates Supreme Court has
looked at sado-masochistic materials in Michigan and affirmed
?
convictions under thatB But under Avanceno vs. New York and
?
Sheppard vs. Hew York and Friedman vs. New York, the United
States Supreme Court has reversed convictions in Radrup type
decisions.
And then they go on to say: Well, however you can
interpret those cases, w©*re going to say that, these magazines
appeal to a prurient interest, et cetara, and that they are
obscene, and that they are not constitutionally protected,
rejecting the defendant’s contention.
QUESTION:

Do you contend that the material sold

by your client here, that the statuta gave no fair warning
that that was included, or do you contend that the statute
was required to have specific enumerations or else decisions
to have it, and so whether your client’s material was warned
about is immaterial?

Or do you contend both?

MR. BECKETT:
QUESTION:
decision?

I think I contend both.
What, was the date of the Geraci

If I have the name right.
MR. BECKETT:
QUESTION:

It was in 1970.

It was prior to —

Pre-Miller.

MR. BECKETT:

Pre-Miller, prior to the date of the

dissemination of materials that alleged — that is alleged to

10

be a crime in this case.
The question under Mi.Her is# as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist has said# a question of notice# a question of
notice to the defendant# appellant Ward and to those sirnilaxiy
situated in Illinois.
As we have set forth in our brief# decisions of
State courts# after this Court's decision in Miller#demonstraba
that those courts have taken a look at their statutes as
written# have taken a look at their previous judicial
interpretations and constructions of 'those statutes# and
determined one of three things:

they heave determined that

their past decisions have limited the scops of that statute
and that there was fair warning to the defendant# the statute
is constitutional# his conviction is affirmed.
They have determined that their prior decisions did
not provide a limiting effect on the statute# that it. would be
unfair to this defendant to apply what they are now going to
construe into the statute under Miller# and therefor© they
would construe the statute to conform with Miller# but they
would give it prospective effect only.
Finally# some Statas have looked at their past,
decisions# found no limiting construction# and held that to
change the statute now would ha a form of legislation# our
s tatuta is uncons ti tutional.
Illinois# I submit# has don© none of the above.

11
Tlie State of Illinois contends that the Illinois
Supreme Court incorporated this Court's Miller examples,
parts (a) and (b), in its decisions in Ridens IX, People vs„
Gould.
The State then contends that the opinion below is of
no moment;, because the court had already included the (a) and
(b) examples.

The opinion below, however, demonstrates fully

and finally that the Illinois Supreme Court has not done so.
In the opinion, which is

the portion which I'm

referring to, which appears at, page 30 of my brief, the Court
reviewed the history of th© Ridens case, the Court noted that
idle defendant was claiming that, the statute did not provide
specificity and that specificity had not been supplied, and
the Court stated that in Ridens "we noted that th© statutory
definition of obscenity includes within the scope of the
'prurient interest' a

'shameful or morbid interest in nudity,

sex, or excretion*.81
In answer to the defendant’s contention that that
wasn't enough, that Miller required specificity, the Court
concluded by saying 58We again express our opinion that the
Illinois statutory definition is sufficiently clear to
withstand constitutional objections.58
The statutory definition, I submit, has no specificity.
As & matter of fact, the construction placed upon the statute,
in response to th© remand order in Miller, allows nudity to be

12
proscribed in Illinois.,

The categorization is nudity# sex# or

excretion»
This Court's holding in Jenkins

,

of course# says;

nudity is not enough under those Miller standards»
I submit to you that the three-judge court's
interpretation of Illinois lav; is persuasive on this Court#
under Gooding vs. Wilson# and that court has completely
accepted our contention as to what the Illinois Supreme Court
has done.
QUESTION: Well now# you wouldn’t suggest that the
three-judge district court's interpretation of

Illinois law

should be taken in preference to the interpretation of the
Supreme Court of Illinois# would you?
MR. BECKETT:

I think if Mr. Justice Rehnquist

would look at the opinions of the Illinois Supreme Court# you
would see that they have missed the thrust of your opinion in
Miller.

They have said that an obscenity statute is a general-

term statute, not unlike an anti-noise ordinance that was
considered by 'this Court in Gr&yned vs. City of Rockford# or
like a disorderly conduct ordinance.
Their -decision is not based upon obscenity cases#
it's based on general-terra statutes# and —
QUESTION:

That would bs a federal constitutional

objection to the Illinois conviction. But I thought you said
that w© should prefer* the three-judge district court’s

13

interpretation of Illinois law to that of the Supreme Court
of Illinois0
MR» BECKETTs

I think you have to look at both of them,

and I think the three-judge court gave, of course in my client's
view, a more objective review of v/h&t the Illinois Supreme
Court had don©»
Three times now, the Illinois Supreme Court has
been asked to correct their misconceptions about Miller, and
they have always said, you know, Well, we think we know what
we're doing, and we're doing it this way»
And it's what that court has done that I believe I'm
asking the Court -to accept -today»
QUESTIO!!:

I thought the three-judge federal court,

had accepted the construction of Illinois law *— of the
Illinois statute put upon it by the Illinois Supreme Court»
MR. BECKETT: And said that that discretion —
QUESTION:
MR. BECKETT:

And held that that was unconstitutional»
That's correct.

And that's what I'm

saying.
In other 'words, I think what, the Attorney General in
this case is asking you to do is what the Illinois Supreme
Court did not do»
QUESTIONs Well, do you think the Illinois Supreme
Court believes that it is acting consistently with Miller?
it seems to

14
MR. BECKETTS

Yes, I think they do believe that»

QUESTION: And if you read Miller to require that a
State will follow, or include in its laws the specifics of
patent offensiveness — if that*s the way you read Miller, if
it’s so plain, I would think it would be plain to the Illinois
Supreme Court»

And if its intention is to follow Miller,

why don’t you accept that?
MR® BECKETTs
QUESTION:

Because they haven’t followed Miller»

Why haven't they?

MR® BECKETT;
QUESTION:

I wish I knew®
Wall, how do you know they haven’t?

MR® BECKETT:

Because the opinion below and the

other ©pinions show that they feel specificity is on the
statute as written, nudity, sex, or excretion? and I don’t
believe that's what Miller said®
QUESTION;

I know, but they read — they are purporting

at least to adhere to the patent offensiveness standard of
Miller®
MR® BECKETT:
QUESTION:

That's correct®

And all Miller did was say let it ~=- it

want on to give some examples of patent offensiveness®
MR® BECKETT:
QUESTION:

That’s correcto

So if til© Supreme Court had said, of

Illinois, had said.: W© agree with the patent offensiveness
standard as explained by the Supreme Court of the United States®

15
Would you accept that?
MR* BECKETT:
more sp©cificD

I think they would have fco be a little

If you look at the decisions of the other

Statese they were not that casual about their approach,
QUESTION: Well# they may not have been., but there
are different styles.» I guess*
QUESTION:

We said in Ham ling that Miller wasn't

intended as a drafting manual# that you didn’t have to simply
repeat word for word the type of thing that was set out in
Miller.
MR. BECKETT:

That’s correct.

But where the

attempt to cons true a statute in accordance with Miller is
including nudity# then not only have they misconceived the
thrust of Miller#

but they have also gone beyond this Court’s

holding in Jenkins.
QUESTION:

Did not the Miller opinion state

categorically that the Court was neither competent fco nor —
that is judicially competent in terms of power — or undertaking
to draft a statute or fc© tell the States how fco draft: a
statute# but merely to furnish some broad guidelines that
would indicate the boundaries within which States must act?
isn't that in the Miller opinion?
MR. BECKETT:

That's correct.

standards# as the Court said.

First Amendment

And it's appellant’s position

that tiie Illinois Supreme Court has not met those standards.

16

The Illinois Supreme Court had a further opportunity
to look at this problem, this conflict, after the three-judge
court rendered its decision in a petition for rehearing, and
denied that petition for rehearing, in this case»
QUESTION? /had your position in this regard really
doesn’t depend on whether the materials at issue here are
protected under the Miller standard or not?
MRa BECKETTs

That’s correct.

It’s not unlike

Lev.7is vs. New Orleans,
QUESTIONS

Yes, unh-hunh,

MR, BECKETTs

Where a remand order of this Court

to this —
QUESTIONs

This would be an overbreadth, I think,

yes,
MR, BECKETTs
correct.

Remand order of the Court, that’s

Remand order of the Court was not followed by the

Louisiana Supreme Court, and the case came back up here, and
you said that it matters not what the conduct was that was
involved her©.
But I do think the materials here are illustrative
of the problem in Illinois of no guidelines.

Those materials

are not unlike materials that this Court in Redrup type cases
held protected under whatever test of obscenity you apply.
It’s very hard to get any guidance, of course, from those
Radrup cass, but in Marks recently you said

that when a

17
fragmented court decides a case, we should look to the
narrowest ground.

I submit, in those cases the narrowest

ground was that those specific materials were constitutionally
protected»
QUESTION: But MiHer succeeded whatever doctrine may
have evolved in the Redrup era, did it not?
MR» BECKETT:

I don't think there was a doctrine

in the Redrup cases»
QUESTION:

I mean, your client is not complaining of

a pre-Miller conviction, is he?
MR» BECKETT:

Well, h© is complaining of a pre-

Miller conviction by saying, you know, the Illinois Obscenity
Statute has never given notice, and this Court recognised
that kind of problem in Miller, and said that a statute must
be written or construed authoritatively to satisfy those
notice problems*
QUESTION: When was your client tried?
MR. BECKETT;

March 1972*

\
v
The prior decisions of the Illinois Supram© Court

are, as I said, unlike Hamling, the Court's consideration of
Roth, Ginzburg, Manual Enterprises vs» Day, because those
decisions concern an ad hoc determination of the materials at
issue in those cases, and do not involve interpretation or
construction of the Illinois Obscenity Statute.
Indeed, at least one-half of the cases cited by the

18

State in their brief are cases decided by Illinois Appellate
Courts after the defendant Ward was arrested»

And it’s hard

to see how they would supply the type of notice that the State
contends that they do about his dissemination of materials
after he was arrested»
QUESTIONS Do you see any difference between notice
and overbreadth?
MR» BECKETT:
QUESTIONs

Yes, I —

Isn't overbreadth curable by a post­

transaction court decision, whereas the fair notice requirement
is not?
MR» BECKETT:
In Ridens,

That's correct»
I think the Illinois Supreme Court,

in the opinion, indicated that it knew, under Miller, it was
supposed to look to its prior decisions, and that it did so,
and concluded from those prior decisions that there was no
limiting effect of those decisions on the statute.
Because in the case they used the phrase, "we must
authoritatively construe", and then they said:

The first

question we want to answer is what community standard are we
going to use under our obscenity guidelines?
And they said, in People vs» Butler, which was
decided before Miller, before Pd dans,

we set a statewide

standard, and so we* re going to adhere to that again today*
But, at the same time, they did not say -that our

19
prior decisions have limited the effect of our statute under
Miller»

And, indeed, Justice Davis, who had written the first

Ridens decision, in dissent pointed out that those prior
decisions did not have that effect.
The whole purpose, I think, of a properly drawn
obscenity statute, written or judicially construed, is that
people such as my client can take the statute and compare it
with to© materials that they have, and they can says

Page 43,

pag© 27, page 85, pag© 64, et cetera, while there’s a type of
portrayal there that may render this patently offensive, and
I'm going to have to make my determination as to whether or
not I can disseminate this material without

with or without

the risk of prosecution»
In a sense, then, the Illinois Supreme Court has
conflicted with decisions of this Court because they say
nudity is enough. And if that's true, of course, anything that
is available on the market today of to© Playboy type mag as in©
would be held obscene or could be held obscene in Illinois,
I'd like to reserve —
QUESTION:

You say the Illinois Supreme Court has

expressly said nudity is enough?
MR, BECKETT:

The Illinois Supreme Court in the

opinion below and also in the Ridens opinion said that we
complained that the statute was not specific enough, however,
w@ note that prurient interest is defined as nudity, sex, or

20

excretion®

That's the quote that I told you was on page 30 of

our brief.
QUESTION?

That it was what, a morbid or shameful

MR. BECKETTs

"A shameful or morbid interest in

nudity, sex, or excretion.*5
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION: But that's not quite saying nudity is
enough, is it?
MR. BECKETT:

It's adding "shameful or morbid" onto

nudity.
QUESTION;

Well, that doesn’t say nudity is enough,

th o ugh.
MR. BECKETT;

"Shameful or morbid", nudity is

enough.
QUESTION:

Or "shameful or morbid interest in

nudity".
MR. BECKETT:

And the point is, by saying that, have

you said -«• has the statute defined sexual conduct?

Has the

statute defined sexual conduct, as you said it must in Miller?
I’d like to reserve my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Noel

Very well, Mr. Beckett.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELBOURNE A. NOEL, JR,, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, NOELs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
In response to the key questions raised in this
appeal, the State of Illinois submits that chapter 38, section
11-20 (b) , its Obscenity Statute definition, has been construed
by Illinois courts, both prior to and after this Court's
decision in Miller vs. California, so as to limit its
definition of obscenity to patently offensive portrayals of
specific sexual conduct»

Thus giving proper notice of the

offense of selling obscene materials, and allowing the
application of the statute under the constitutional standards
enunciated in Miller.
Now, this case, of course, presents the post-Mi Her
problem of what States have to do in order to comply with the
constitutional requirements of Miller vs. California.
There were many different approaches taken by the
States after 1973» in trying to bring themselves into line
with the Miller requirements.

The different kinds of

approaches have been alluded to, both in the appellant’s and
the appellee's briefs.

Very often legislation was employed,

more often some sort of construction of statutes by the State
high courts was involved.
And even within those group —* that group of States,

22
that, deedded to reconstrue, 'their statutes to satisfy Miller,
there was a great diversity of opinion as to how this should
be properly accomplished»

And what this case presents, it

focuses on one technique employed to construe a State statute
into line with Miller, one technique out of an entire spectrum
of techniques employed0
And it asks you to decide whether or not this is a.
proper construction of the Illinois statute, in line with
Miller, or whether the Illinois Supreme Court missed the boat,
they used the wrong words, they should start over again and
perhaps follow some other technique»
And I think. it’s true to say that in the spectrum
of attempts to comply with this Court's Miller requirements
by construing State statutes, you have — you start at one
end with those States that took the approach which apparently
is adopted by the appellant here- and was adopted by the
court, the three-judge court in the Eagle Books case in
the Northern District of Illinois, that is the very literal
approach; that in order to do it right the State court has
to sit down and say:

Here are the Mi Her examples, here are

the Miller requirements; we do now hereby incorporate those
requirements and those examples into our State statute as
providing the limitations as to what can be prosecuted under
that statute»
That’s the liberales t approach»

And several States

23
took that approach - notably Florida and Alabama and Texas.
Then there is» I think in the middle.» the Illinois
approach, where the. examples are reprinted# the standards are
mentioned, and there*s a blanket statement that:

We construe

the Illinois statute as incorporating these standards and
examples.
Then, on the far other end of the spectrum, you
have some State courts that atte mpted to accomplish this
purpose merely by making an oblique reference to the Miller
standards, as, for example, the Oklahoma court did in Field vs
Hess, whan they simply noted the — they bowed in the direc­
tion of the Millar standards, and they said: Well, of course,
whenever our statute is applied, the Miller standards are
implied.

Without getting into any specifics or reprinting

them at all.
And so you have this entire spectrum, and the
center of the spectrum, I think, the Illinois approach, is
the one that Your Honors are requested to decide at this time.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you to say that Illinois

Supreme Court said that what we decided before Hi 1 le.r was not
changed by Miller?
MR. NOEL:

The only Supreme Court — yes, I think

'that's their position.

I think that*s their position.

think that — and this is — I think there are two —
QUESTION: But they didn’t spell it out, though

I

24
MR. NOELs

Well, whafc they did was, Your Honor,

I believe, state that the Illinois statute was constitutional
following this construction, and I think they also expressed
the opinion that the statute gave the required specificity.
Admittedly, as I say, they did not take the
liberalest approach, and I don’t think we would b© here today
But I think that

if they had taken the liberalest .approach.

it is not necessary for them to have taken that literal
approach in order to have complied with Miller.
QUESTIONs

But the Legislatura thought so.

MR. NOEL;

I really don’t know, Your Honor, if

that’s correct or not.

I cannot speak for —
i

/

OUESTION; But they did pass an Act.
\

MR. NOEL:

They did pass an Act, yes, Your Honor.

I don’t know if there was any — if that was a comment on
what they thought the Illinois Supreme Court had done or not?
I have no basis for saying that.
But I think this points up — this question that
you’ve just asked points up whafc I think — I think there are
two fundamental weaknesses in the approach of the appellant
in tills particular case.
First of all, I think the appellant ignores the
plain intent and even some of the wording of the Illinois
Supreme Court when it decided the relevant cases of People vs.
Ridens the second time around, Ridens II, and People vs. Gould.

25
I think they ignore the statements of the court and
the plain intent of the court in those cases»
Second3.y, and to me much more unexplainable, is
the complete failure to recognize a long and

detailed history

of obscenity law construction in Illinois prior to and at the
time of Miller by the Illinois Supreme Court and the Illinois
Appellate Courts»

It is not true to say that the Illinois Supreme
Court had only considered one case prior to 1972, in limiting
its statute, or that it only considered cases involving city
ordinances.

In our brief, Part III, pages 18, 19, 20 and 21,

w© have collected no fewer than ten different decisions of
Illinois reviewing courts dealing with construction and
application of the Illinois Obscenity Statute.
The earliest of these cases is People vs. Sikora,
a 1965 cases, which dealt with a number of books that were
brought before the court, and in which they held that certain
specific kinds of acts -«■ and I don’t want to offend anybody’s
sensibilities by going through them, they are listed on page
19 ~~ including sadism and masochismP —
QUESTION:

Page 19 of your* brief?

MR» NOEL:

Yes. Your Honor, page 19 of our brief»

— including sadism and masochism, were obscene»
These descriptions in these books

were obscene under the

federal approach at that time and under the Illinois statutes.

26

This was followed by — and that was under the
Illinois Obscenity Statute# not a State ordinance or a city
ordinance# this x^as followed by the City of Blue Island vs»
DeVilbiss # which was a review of a city ordinance which was
exactly identical to the State statute? and the Illinois
Supreme Court noted that in the decision and proceeded to
deal with the two — or proceeded to deal with the ordinance
as if it were dealing with the statute? they were indistin­
guishable? that one had simply copied the other0
And in that court they added — in that case they
added some other specific types of action that were considered
to be obscene under the statute.
Then you get to the case of the City of Chicago vs.
G-sraci# which my opponent mentioned# that’s the third case
down the line from the Illinois Supreme Court# and yet that
occurred only in 1970# as far back as 1970.
Now# in that case# truly there was only a municipal
ordinance that was concerned.

But the definition of .

obscenity in that ordinance was much broader than the Illinois
statutory definition# and the court’s concern — it used cases
t

interchangeably between ordinar.ce consideration and statute
consideration# and the Illinois Supreme Court's concern clearly
was :

Does this material fall under constitutional protection

or doesn’t it?
And I would submit to Your Honors that is the proper

27
approach to take in applying any obscenity statute regardless
of whether it's a State statute or an ordinance# and regardless
of what its wording is.
And the reasoning of the Geraci case applies directly
to the type of situation we have and to the application of a
State statutory situation.

In fact# Justice Schaefer# who

decided that case# quoted liberally from his Sikora opinion
earlier# which involved the State statute.
without going through all the

And then#

and there are a host of

other cases# decided prior to and during 1972 and 573 some -—
not half of them from the appellate court# fewer than that?
I

and there are cases#at least three# prior to the time of this
arrest in this case# where the Supreme Court said certain
things are not
statute.

are not — prohibited

by the obscenity

And one of the things# interestingly# they said in

Geraci was that nudity was not prohibited by the State
statute.
QUESTION: Did the three-judge district court discuss
People v. Sikora?
MR. NOEL:

I do not think they did# Your Honor? I

can’t recall specifically.

My recollection is that they did

not. specifically discuss any of the old Illinois cases prior
to Ridens II# Ridens I and Ridens II.
problem with that opinion.

And I think that is a

I think that's why they reached

the conclusion they did# is that they failed to go back into

28

this prior history of Illinois decisions, which, of course,
the Illinois Supreme Court had. I think, in mind when they
wrote the Ridens II case, but did not lay out.
QUESTION;
I may.

General Noel-, I have two questions, if

Is the heart of the Slkora decision that you think

is applicable here, the reference to sadism and masochism?
MR. NOEL:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Do you think those terms are perfectly

clear and specifically what they meant?

I get some

uncertainty as to the difference between the exact, meaning
cf those terms.
MR. NOEL:

Well, Your Honor, first of all, —

QUESTION:

Particularly in Hamllng, the neurotic

and prurient interest.
MR. NOEL:

In the later Geracl case, Your Honor,

that was elaborated & little bit more, because in Geraci they
were dealing with magazines of the sado-masochistic character
and the court described the magazines, Justice Schaefer
described them in a part of that,of the Geraci opinion, and
indicated his belief that — and he described the magazines
as sado-masochistic magazines which contain photographs
portraying lesbianism, rape, whippings, beatings, bondage,
axing, and other abnormal sexual conduct.
And so he spelled it out a little bit more in Geraci»
and he said that — he indicated by the negative, by saying

29

that this was -- he said:

'Idles appellants says that this is

not hardcore pornography? w© disagree.
So he's indicating that it was hardcore pornography.
QUESTION?

My second question iss

Presume the

State statute says — our State Legislature says our statute
shall prohibit everything in the examples given in Miller, and
also sadism and masochism, and giv© four or fiv© other specific
concrete examples, and then sayss

And in addition, anything

which is patently offensive and as the general standard of ~
in other words, it has the general category and it lists
fch© specifics as examples that fch® Miller opinion dealt with.
Would that satisfy Mi Her, do you think?
MR. NOEL:

I think it. would. Your Honor.

I would

think that 'would go •—
QUESTION:

In other words, all you need is an

example, you don't need any limitation?
MR. NOEL:
gets

Well, I think, Your Honor, that this

pushes me back to the point ©f having to admit that

I think it is impossible to have a complete scientific
catalog of all of the types of actions which are cataloged as
obscenity and are prohibitable.
QUESTION:
MR. NOEL:

Then that —
Because x think the mind of man goes

beyond «■QUESTION: Well, accepting that, what is fch© purpose

30

of the specificity requirement?

Why isn’t just the general

language sufficient?
As long as you have a catch-all, general pick-up
clause, what more do you need?
MRo NOEL:

I think that the statute — I think that

the addition of these specific examples thi£ this Court gave
in Miller, and that the Illinois Supreme Court has talked
about and that many courts have set up exactly as you sey.
For example, the New Hampshire Suprema Court, in the case
that my opponent cited in their brief»
I think the purpose is to cover the most common
to very specifically cover the most common types of
obscenity, to provide the kind of notice to a bookseller
that the appellant her© is concerned about»

He can look at

these examples, these statutes, these cases, and he can go
down and he can tick off what he finds in his magazines or
books, and he can probably decide 99 pereant of the cases on
the basis of these examples, because they, while not
completely all-inclusive, I think they probably do cover the
’t

most common, most frequent types of obscenity that is going
to be prosecuted and that, the bookseller is going to com©

into contact with,
•There may be borderline situations that these
examples cannot cover, as with the drug situation — well, I
won’t mention that»

31
But,, as the mind of man invents new types of
acfcrivity, there are going to be borderline cas@3
are going to have to rule upon,

the courts

And I think this Court

recognized that in Miller, and recognized it in Handingg
and specifically said that that by itself, that fact, is not
sufficient to render these statutes unconstitutional,
QUESTIONS Could I ask if the -- there were two
publications involved her®?
MR, NCELs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor,
Were they both in one count, on

information or indictment?
MR, NOELs

Yes, they were, Your Honor,

QUESTION? And your contention is that both of them,
each of them satisfies the Miller standards?
MR, NOELs

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTIONS

Let’s assume w© disagreed with you on

on© of them,
MR, NOELs

I think you could still uphold the

conviction, Your Honor,
QUESTIONS Why is that?
MR, NOEL;

Because I think the

because they

were lumped together, it’s on© offense, and I think that,
©specially in light of the very small sentence that was put
dawn, one day in jail and a

$200 fins, and I think in light

of — if he was peddling on© magazine that was obscene out

32
of the too, he was guilty of a violation, of the Illinois
Obscenity Statuta, which is all the count charges.

I mean,

it’s not divided into two counts.
QUESTION:

Is that the Illinois law, that —

suppose the Supreme Court of Illinois had decided that one of
these publications was not obscene, would the Illinois law
have called for affirmance nevertheless?
MR. NOEL:

I can’t mention a specific case. Your

Honor, to answer that question.
b© something

My belief is that it would

they would apply something like the Harmless

Error Doctrina, to say that the conviction was founded on a
violation of obscenity, and therefor© it will stand.
As long as the sentence does not reflect a feeling feat
there was a lot of offensiveness here and that society had
to punish in some outrageous fashion, I think the sentence
reflects a minimal -•*-<
QUESTION:

Now, under which one of th© specifics

given in Miller do these publications fall under?
MR. NOEL:

That’s a very good question, Your Honor,

because, of course, fee Miller examples do not mention sado­
masochism specifically.
I think that if we look at the examples «QUESTION: So if th© court believed that those ~
that fee specific examples in Millar limited the category of
patent offensiveness to those kinds of things, then you’re in

33
troub le?
MR» NOEL:

No* I don’t: think so, Your Honor»

Because I think
QUESTION: Well, under which -MR» NOEL;

-*» I think under these examples * the

examples themselves are not meant to b© a catalog of
everything»

I think that there are different kinds of

activity that com© under these somewhat general terms in
the examples® And I would say that this kind of material that
you will see in these two magazines, "Bizarre World" and "The
Study of Sado-Masochism" , can coma under either of two
examples here in Millars

patently offensive representations

of ultimate sexual acts pervertedt actual or simulated»
I think that it’s fair to say that sado-masochistic
actions of the typ© described here# certainly by definition#
sadotmasochism is designed to arouse

sexual interest and

sexual pleasure.
It’s a kind of sex-related act which is a perverted
version of an ultimate sex act# and I think it could com©
under that,Secondly# in every one of these types of pictures#
and there ar© many# many times throughout these magazines
that this occurs, you have nudity exhibition of the genitals ?
it’s almost impossible# in the typ© of magazines that these
are# for you to ha.vs fch© pictorial content without having

34

lewd exhibition of the genitals»

And so I think it comes

under that example also»
There are two possibilities» And I think there's
plenty of authority for the proposition that it's pretty
wall accepted that sado-masochism comes under these examples ,
because, for example, in my

opponent's brief, when he talks

about the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision, that court
said:

We are going to take the Miller examples and they

ar© going to become the limits of New Hampshire law; but
w@ are going to spell out what they include»
And the following paragraph, the New Hampshire
Supreme Court said:

Those examples include sado-masochistic

abuse»
Similarly, the statutes that have been passed by
vary

conscientious legislatures, in attempting to catalog

precisely what —
QUESTION:
MR, NOEL:

You're speaking of the Harding case?
Yes, Your Honor, the Harding case»

And secondly, the legislative examples that have
followed Miller, where they have tried to h© as specific as
they can, the ones that we've had brought to our attention
here, for example, the Louisiana statute that's also quoted
in my opponent's brief, the Oregon statute which this Court
quoted with approval in the Miller case,

they all mention

sado-masochistic abuse as being a type of obscenity»

And

35

so they, all these legislatures, think that it falls within
the examples that Your Honors gave in the Millar case,
QUESTION;

Mr, Noel, could I follow up on the

questions I asked before?
As I understand your argument, you say that the
examples given by the Illinois Supreme Court in prior cases
as well as adoption of the Miller examples include about 99
percent of those which -MR, NOEL;

That would be a rough guess,

QUESTION;

That would b© about one percent not

getting —
MR, NOEL;

Well, I wouldn’t want to b@ held to

on® percent, Your Honor? but I think that's a rough
proportion,
QUESTION;

But the on® percent is not specifically

defined within the general description. As I understand it,
the Illinois Suprema Court has never said there may not be a
prosecution for the one percent, there may bo prosecutions
for ’these 99 parcant examples,
MR, NOEL;

It has -- the Illinois Supreme Court,

I may answer you this way, Your Honor, if I can, fch© Illinois
Supreme Court has stated which types of conduct are not
obscene.

In cases that. — and so have the Appellate

Courts -*■ in cas© which cam© up and said this is a borderline
situation, is it obscene or isn’t it?

36

QUESTIONs

Well# what they've done, they've

given us 99 percent in specific examples, and they've given
us some that are not within the 100 percent»
MR® NOELs

The other side, that's right»

QUESTION?

There is still a on® percent that is

potentially subject to prosecution under the general
definition, because Illinois has never said; We've listed
these and this is all that can b® subject to prosecution»
MR» NOELs

I would say, Your Honor, no one has

ever said that; no on©»
QUESTIONS Well, if a Legislature, for example,
give a list and said this is ail there is, that would be
all right»
MR» NOEL:
Your Honor»

I don't think that would suffice, either,

I would b® willing to bet that if w© took the

most specific statute in the lend and want down it with an
obscenity expert, he could com© up with possible combina­
tions or versions of an act that would not b© specifically
covered in that list»
QUESTION s

But would nevertheless fca prosecutable?

MR» NOELs Which would b© prosecutable until some
court saids

Here is the definition, here is the act, it

does or dess not apply»
QUESTION;

How do you read, on page 27 of the

Miller opinion, the sentences

"Under the holdings announced

37
today., no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or
exposures of materials unless these materials ~~ and so forth
depict offensive hardcore sexual conduct specifically
defined by the regulating State law as written or construed®"
As I landers tend what you" re saying is one percent may be
prosecuted# but not no one®
MR® NOEL:

Well, I think that what that means is

that there has to b© a definition# there has to b® a
substantial definition ”**
QUESTION:

In 99 parcent of the cases?

MR® NOEL: The 99 percent definition# yes®
QUESTION: But then how do you -- the words "no on®"
apparently war© not — you say the Court didn't mean what
they said in that.
MR® NOEL:

Well# no# I didn’t say that at ali»

I

think what that means is that at som© point in any given ~
o£ course anybody can be prosecuted for anything? the question
is# what will tha court do with the prosecution# will it
throw it out or not®

I think that opinion must leave open

the possibility of judicial review and application of the
definitions to whatever the prosecuting attorney is charging
with being obscene,

That's all I'm saying»

And I’m saying that as with most other Statutes#
it is impossible to b© 100 percent certain that every possible
example of what you’re prohibiting is cataloged in that

38

statuta.
QUESTION i And therefore the ultimate test is th@
general tripartite Standard and the requirement of
specificity roe rely is a -« all you need is a group of
11lustrations ?
MR. NOEL:

The ultimat® test is what a court of the

State or federal government, and ultimately this Court,
believes is included within the specific examples given, or
is not included,

I think that's the ultimate test. And I

don't think it's possible to remove that function from the
Courts.

I don't think it’s possible to sat up an autonomous

little operation, with the Legislature and the prosecuting
attorney, so that each one knows exactly everything that is
prohibitable and 'that which is not.
1 think you have to rely on the courts for the
ultimata fin® tuning.
QUESTION;

Is it not correct, though, that some of

the other States have in effect said;

The only things which

may b© subject to prosecution &r© those identified specifically?
MR. NOEL:

Yes, and then they've adopted the Miller

examples.
But, as we have already indicated, —
QUESTION:
MR. NOEL;

Yes, but Illinois has not done that,
the Miller examples themselves are

not a very long catalog, and they have many possible types of

39

conduct that could be arguably included under them.
QUESTION: But isn’t there this difference between
Illinois and these other States:

they have at least said

the statute is limited to certain examples.

Illinois has

never said that.
MR. NOEL:

Illinois has — that's true, that's why

I say Illinois has not taken the lit©ralest approach $ but
Illinois has said more than some other States.

Illinois has

said that it has specifically# in Ridens II the Court
reprinted at length large portions of this Court's Miller
©pinion and said:

after further discussion, we new construe

th© Illinois statute as incorporating parts (a) and (b) of
fell® Miller tost, which included# in their reprint# specific
examples of Miller obscenity,
And then later# in People vs. Gould# Chief Justice
Ward went on to reprint this whole itora again# and he said:
We have construed our statute to incorporate parts {&) and (b)
as I have set. out above in the above quotation.
Again referring to th© examples.

They have don©

this in addition to toe constructions that they’ve already
placed on th© statute*
So# in ray opinion# what they have done# I think#
admittedly# my job would b© much easier if they had spelled
all this out? but I think a fair reading of their prior
decisions# with the Ridens II and the Gould decisions#

40

indicates that what they have dona, they have taken this
Court's Miller standards and examples and added them on to
the prior decisions of the Illinois Supreme Court and the
Illinois Appellate Courts for an amalgam standard constitu­
tional standard of obscenity.
I think they've said that we're going to stick by
what we've done in the past, because it was correct? in
addition, we're going to inform the public that we are adding
on the Millar requirements and Miller examples, and the
combination of this will be applied as tha Illinois Obscenity
Statute in the future.
QUESTION:

as

I understand it, the Supreme Court of

Illinois continued to construe the statute to reach materials
that were utterly without redeeming value —
MR. NOELs

That's correct, Your Honor.

They were

careful to avoid part (c) of this Court's Millar test, which
reduced the "utterly without

redeeming value test", they

said that that was already in Illinois la.#, and that they
were going to keep that until such time as the Legislature
spoke otherwise.
So that we do have in this on© particular standard
that is more strict, and that was the standard, by the way,
that was applied to this particular case.
I think that it's totally incorrect to say that
under the Illinois statute, even on its face, that mere nudity

41

could b© prosecuted in. Illinois.

Other than the fact that

the Supreme Court said in Geracl that it

can't,

there is

the simple fact that the Illinois statuta requires — and
the comments to the statute, that we reprinted in the first
part of our brief, I think are very illuminating as to what
the intent of the Legislature was, back in 1961 when it
passed the statute. And they stated — and it's written in
the statute that th® matter, being accused of being obscene
must go substantially beyond customary limits of candor.
Certainly in this day and age no Illinois court is
going to say that mere nudity goes beyond the customary
limits of candor.

That, element is written into th© statute,

to prohibit the kind of thing that was suggested here.
There is no way that nudity can ba prosecuted under Illinois
statute, ©ithar under th© face of -th© statute or under th©
Illinois decisions that have come down following it.
I think that the State's position is that idler® is
support for th© Illinois construction of this statute in
Ridens II and in Peop1© vs. Gould, direct support for

it in

this Court's opinion in Hamling vs. United States.
I think substantially the sane approach was taken
by tills Court as by the Illinois Suprema Court. This Court
being a little bit more specific, but I think th® approach is
fs$ same.
Thar© is also direct precedential support in the

42

State vso Watkins, which was one of the cases like Ridens ,
which this Court vacated and remanded and sent back to
South Carolina fater the Miller decision was announced.
The Stata Supreme Court reaffirmed its prior ruling
and, in a technique not too dissimilar to the Illinois
technique, said that we are going to limit our statuta to
types of obscenity such as those listed in the Miller
examples.
Tiiat case came back up to this Court on appeal, and
the appeal was dismissed for want of a substantial federal
question.
So I think those are two direct precedents that
are very closely analogous in justifying the decision of the
Illinois Supreme Court in Ridens and in Gould.
Secondly, I would simply like to state that I do
not believe it’s true that tills Court — well, we’re not
presented, this Court is not presented here with the question
of whether the Illinois Supreme Court failed to obey th©
remand of a case.

The case that was remanded by tills Court

after Miller was People vs. Ridens, Ridens vs. Illinois in
this Court.

That case, of course, went through the mill

again with th© Illinois Supreme Court, and it came up again
on a cert petition, making the same allegations -Hiat are
being mad© -today before this Court about the statute, and
tails Court denied certiorari by a five-to-four vote.

43

This cases, the Ward case, comes long after that
situation, and of course w© are not dealing with the remand
situation here»
i don’t think there's any questi.on,. Your Honors,
that, upon reviewing the two publications involved in this
case, that they are obscene under any definition of hardcore
¥

pornography»

The only publication that there seems to b©

dispute about, even between the parties to this causa, is
a publication called "Bisarr© World”, and I would submit to
Your Honors that the main part of that publication is a 16-page
full-color pullout, quote-unquote, called *Dungeon.
Domination”, and in that particular little item, between
pages 14 and 43, there are many examples of torture with
apparent blood on the victim and tortura and lewd exhibition
of the genitals»
And X would submit that if sado-masochism itself
can b© prohibited by obscenity laws, then this indeed is
obscenity and is properly considered prahibifeeble in Illinois»
The other publication, there doesn't seam to be
too much disagreement between the parties»

I think that

it's — that th@r© can b© no problem of retroactivity here»
I think if h© had consulted counsel in 1971, before he
purchased and sold these magazines, if he’d looked at the
many decisions, prior decisions of Illinois courts which deal
with sado-masochism, Mr» Wesley Ward would have known that he

44

was selling magazines that: wer© prohibitabl© under Illinois
law, and he should have taken warning,, if he had looked and
noted that? he

should have had proper notice that this was

prohibited conduct, and he would not have done it..
I think there is no question here but that the
prior construction of Illinois statutes gave Wesley Ward
sufficient notice that he could ba constitutionally charged
and convicted of the offenses that were contained in this
indictment.
Thank you very much, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very WQ.il.

Do you have anything further, Mr, Beckett?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. STEVEN BECKETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BECKETT:

Just a couple of remarks, Your

Honor.
First of all, let's assume for the moment, because
it is true that Mr. Ward did consult counsel back in 1971
or prior thereto, and the status of Illinois lav? was just
like the status of obscenity law throughout the nation:
hopeless confusion.

As emphasized, I think, in thag Geraci

opinion, where the Court said:

We .really don't understand

why 'She Supreme Court of the United States said material
lik© tills is. constitutionally protected, but we’re going to
say it’s not constitutionally protected,

45
And I subxn.it that in that situation you’ re very
hard-pressed to say that these particular materials, which
are not hardcore materials — they ate not the type of
materials that this Court described in Hamling vs. United
States, you do not h&v© explicit sexual activity»
In the one raagasine, "Illustrated Case Histories”,
th@r© may be suggestions of s.exual activity, but in the other
on© there are no suggestions of sexual activity»
Th© Illinois Supreme Court has, in effect, in
Ridens, in Gould, in Ward,,reenacted the Illinois Obscenity
Statute, and they have done so not. by engrafting any
examples of obscenity or any specificity —
QUESTION;

What do you think the Court should

do, if it disagreed with you on ©verytiling except on the
issue of th© obscenity of on© of these items?
MR. BECKETT:

I think it would be a violation of

the First Amendment to allow a conviction for one
constitutionally protected magazine to stand.

In this

situation, th© State can certainly charge obscenity in two
separate counts. So you've got the ©ffect of a general
verdict, without knowing which magazine the judge relied
on, if at all.
In other words, th© judge may have looked at
"Illustrated Case Histories” end determined it was not
obscene, but the other on© was, and still convicted.

46

And. now we get up to the United States Supreme
Court and they says

Wall, that judg©' was wrong; the o-ther

on® is obscene.
QUESTION:

Was it a bench trial or jury?

MR. BECKETT:

Yes, it was a. bench trial.

The other one's obscene, and the other on© is
constitutionally protected.
QUESTION; Was th©r© any request mad© for the
equivalent of a special verdict?
MR. BECKETT;

No, there was not.

QUESTION; Well, then do you think your standing
to raise that issue is unimpaired at this stage?
MR. BECKETT;

No, I don't.

I think, certainly

under — I believe under the First Amendment, I don't think
we should be allowed to b© and remain convicted, if one
magazine is not obscene.
QUESTION:

You mean "yes, I do"9 not "no, I don't."

MR. BECKETT;

Yes.

Part (b) of Miller doesn't require a State to give
examples; part (b) of Miller requires a State to give
specificity.

If you have the on© percent that Mr. Justice

Stevens was talking about, that material may not be
prosecutable.
QUESTION;

Yes., but the most that would happen —«*

even if w© agreed with you on that, would be that we would

47
remand, vacate the judgment and remand for resentencing, or
possible resentencing?
MR® BECKETTs

I think that if you agreed with me,

then you would say that the statute and the cases have
never —
QUESTIONs

No, no.

Evan if wa -- if w© disagreed

with you on everything ©Kcept the —
MRo BECKETTs
QUESTION;

Oh, the obscenity vel non?
Of on© magazine® Then the most we

would do, even if we agreed with you on that point, would be
to remand, wouldn't it?

For resentencing® Vacate®

We

wouldn’t set aside — we wouldn’t say that the conviction
couldn’t stand entirely, would w@?
MR» BECKETT;

My position is that under th© First

Amendment I don’t think he should b© allowed to remain
convicted for disseminating material that is protected under
the First Amaadmant»
Thank you, Your Honor»
MR» CHIEF. JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentleman»
Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:11 o'clock, a»me, th© case in tee
above-anti tied matter was submitted. ]
