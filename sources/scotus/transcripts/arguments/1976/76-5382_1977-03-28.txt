ORMi ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KALMUS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KALMUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
My name is Geoffrey Kalmus.
private firm in New York City.

I'm a partner in a

And I'm here representing

Willie Jasper Darden.
We ask in this case that the Court set aside Mr.
Darden's conviction for first degree murder and sentence
to death because of gross prosecutorial misconduct during
summation.
The Court has not heretofore in reviewing a
state conviction held chat the prosecutor's closing argument
so far transcended the bounds of legitimacy and decency as
to constitute a deprivation of a defendant's Fourteenth
Amendment rights.
Nonetheless, it did recognise in Justice Rehnquist's
opinion in DeChristoforo that prosecution's remarks to the
jury may so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the
resulting conviction a denial of due process.
Moreover, it has ruled in many other contexts that

4
the circumstances of a criminal trial or other sorts of
misconduct during it may so impair the fundamental integrity
of the jury's determination and deliberations as to constitute
a denial of due process»
We ask, therefore, in this case that the Court
apply settled doctrine to vacate a conviction and a juryrecommended death sentence infected by willful, outrageous
prosecutorial misconduct.
As we see it, if ever a prosecutor’s misconduct in
summation can constitute a denial of a fair trial, this is
such a case.
I'd like first to focus a little bit on the evidence
because it’s crucial here.

It’s crucial that the Court

understand that this was not a case in which the evidence
was overwhelming.

This was a case, in which the jury might

rationally and reasonably go either way at the end of the
evidence.
We think the case was doubtful.

We think that the

evidence plainly shows that, notwithstanding the respondent's
views to the contrary.
Now, what was the evidence here?
QUESTIONx

At what stage of the argument was there

challenge or objection made to the argument?
MR. KALMUS:

Your Honor, there was only one objection

taken in the course of the prosecutor McDaniel*s argument,

5

and. that was rather far along in it.

And at that point

defense counsel stood up and objected to one of McDaniel’s
statements that he wished the defendant had been maimed or
his head had been blown off or he’d been ■— cut his own
throat, of which there were a good many such statements.
That x^as the only objection taken.

The trial

judge, simply without any discussion, said, overruled.
Proceed, Mr. McDaniel.
But turning to the question of the evidence as it
stood, at the close of the defense

case, there were only

three significant items of evidence supporting the
prosecution’s claim that Mr. Darden had committed this
robbery-murder of a man named Turman.
Two of the items of evidence were identifications,
those by Mrs. Turman who was working in the furniture store
when the assaillant came in, and that of a young man named
Mr. Arnold, a 16 year old boy who kind of happened in the
back door while the crime was in progress and was also shot
and injured by the assailant.
Both of those identifications were sharply challenged
at the trial.
stantial doubt.

And both of them, I think, were put in sub­
That subject was one in which we dealt at

length in our brief, because at the time we submitted our
brief, the identification issue was also one upon which the
Court had granted cert.

6

You may recall that in early January cert was
limited to the first question presented, that of the
prosecutorial misconduct.
One can judge Mrs. Turman * s identification of the
assailant in a few fashions.

Number one, she gave a description

to a deputy sheriff right after the crime that bore no
resemblance to the petitioner.
Number two, she described the assailant as
wearing clothing that differed markedly from that which
petitioner was described as wearing by somebody who had .seen
him at. the scene of his automobile accident which, according
tc. the prosecution, happened as he was fleeing the crime.
Number three, Mrs, Turman never

was asked to, or

in fact, identified the petitioner in any kind of a formal
lineup, be it photo or live.
Number four, her only pretrial identification came
into evidence on the direct testimony at trial occurred at a
preliminary hearing when the petitioner was the only black
man in the courtroom seated with counsel at the defense
table, and was — Mrs, Turman was asked to point him out,
and she did.

And one can judge the reliability of that

identification by what she said when she was
Court, in effect, are you sure?

asked by the

And she responded, why,

when 7. walked into the courtroom and was seated in the back

and I saw him from the rear, I knew this was the man who had

7

killed my husband»

This was somebody she had seen for a

few minutes during a robbery , and she claimed to know him
when she walked in from his back»
Mr. Arnold's identification —• this is the 16 year
old boy — was subject, to substantial infirmity as well.
First of all, he testified at trial that he had seen the
assailant for only 20 to 25 seconds, and that part of that
time he was looking down tit Mr. Turman who had been shot
and lay in the doorway and was trying to give aid to him.
Number two, he said his mind want blank during that
20 or 25 seconds.
Number three, he was never the subject, of a proper
lineup, be“it photo or otherwise.

He did- while in the

hospital, identify the petitioner’s photo in a group shorn
to him, but his testimony was, at the trial, that four of
the six photos shown to him looked nothing like the petitioner.
And that the one he did see and identify, lo and behold, it
bore the petitioner's name across it, Darden across the
chest, and the date, 9-9-73, the date of the crime„
And Mr. Arnold testified that he had read about the
crime before he was asked to make this photo identification.
The final piece of evidence that the state had
that amounted to anything was a gun.

And the gun was indis­

putably of the calibre used in the crime, a .38f and it
was found some 40 feet from the highway, and roughly the

n
same distance <from the place at which the petitioner had
had his automobile accident ~ no dispute that he had the
accident a few miles from the scene of the crime at around the
sme time.

And that gun was found a day later, not very

far fromthe automobile accident, and not very far from the
highway.

And indeed, there was no dispute that anybody

might have tossed it out of a passing car.
So that was the state’s case, as the case went to
the jury.

On the defendant’s side, the defendant had taken

the stand in his own behalf, he was the only witness in his
own behalf.

He had told what 1 believe the record demonstrate

to be a coherent and plausible story, not inconsistent with
the prosecution’s story but for the identification?
in itself inherently an implausible story.

not

And that was

the case for the defense.
So in sum,the ca.se as it reached the summation
stage was a close one.

And we think the prosecution’s

summation itself in part demonstrates that.
I think one can ask the rhetorical question,
quite appropriately, would any sensible prosecutor have
carried on the way McDaniel did here if he thought he had an
easy winner?

Is this the kind of thing that any experienced

— and this was an experienced prosecutor -- would do if he
were comfortable with his case?

And we think the answer to

that is an obvious one, and that McDaniel's conduct itself

9

demonstrates that he thought his case was a shaky one»
As to the merits of the summation — the demerits
of the summation — the character of McDaniel's conduct,
I don't think that one need pass beyond the brief of the
respondent, and the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida
to know how it should be characterised.
The respondent's brief, what did it call the
summation by McDaniel here?

state said.

Inflammatory and irrelevancies — the

Improper appeals to the jury5a emotion.

FinalIv

the ravings of the prosecution.
That's the state’s characterisation, not ours,
of the summation by McDaniel.
1 think if you read the state’s brief, it’s only

real argument in defense of this summation, apart fromthe
procedural points that it has raised, is, that the summation
was so bad that no sensible jurors would have paid any
attention to anything that McDaniel said.
Mow, the majority in the Supreme Court of Florida ~
the conviction and the death sentence were affirmed by
5 to 2 *— the majority opinion also recognized, we think,
that the closing argument was an improper one.
What did they say?

They

said that although the

prosecution's remarks under ordinary circumstances would

1
10

constitute a violation of the coda of professional responsi­
bility, in this particular case they amounted to harmless
error when the totality of the record is considered.
Again, the language used by the prosecution, Justice
Boyd wrote for the majority, would possibly have been reversi­
ble error if it had used regarding a less heinous set of
crimes.
IIlogically, however, the Supreme Court of Florida
said, this crime was such a shocking one that all of this
inflammatory, irrelevant nonsense was proper,
QUESTION:

Did they say that it was proper, or

did they say that it wouldn’t have any greater impact than
the evidence itself?
MR. KALMUS:

I don’t think they quite said that,

Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. KALMUS:
QUESTION:

They surely didn’t say it was proper.
No —
So you misspoke yourself there

considerably.
MR. KALMUS:

I think your comment is certainly a

fair one, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kalians, the majority of the

Supreme Court of Florida, I take it, did disagree with you
as to the closeness of the evidence.

In that second to

last paragraph at page 163 of the appendix, they say that

11
it was pretty much of an overwhelming ■—
MR. KALMUS:
that.

I quite agree with you*, they do say

I have read the record a few times, and have tried to

s ummarize it as we see the case, and — balancing it on
both sides.
might

And we do not read it that way at all.

And I

.say that in terms of our description of the evidence

as it went to the jury, the state’s brief doesn’t disagree
with us in any substantial way.

The state takes the same facts

and says, we think those are overwhelming.
Bat they're not quarrelling at all with the
presentation of the facts in our brief,
QUESTION:

Mr. Kalmus?

MR. KALMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
The Florida Supreme Court said it did

not approve the prosecutor’s argument.

What it said, as I

read the opinion, was, that it a ounted to harmless error,
in view of the overwhelming character of the evidence
against the defendant.
MR. KALMUS:

They did use the phrase, amounting to

harmless error, at one point in their opinion.

Thatis quite

true.
QUESTION:

You think it would have been stronger if

they’d used it more than once?
MR. KALMUS:

No, 1 think it would have been stronger

if they had said more accurately, this kind of conduct cannot

12
amount to harmless error? that there is some conduct so
outrageous, willful conduct — no question about that here*
the state concedes it -- that goes so far beyond the bounds
that it cannot be harmless error»

We cannot say that the

jury was either so smart as to disregard it entirely, or
so detached as to ignore the many statements from the
prosecutor that drew into issue all kinds of matters having
nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
QUESTIONs

Would you not agree that a completely

dispassionate, objective description of what had taken
place, the actions of the petitioner, would have in itself
/

amounted to a shocking kind of statement? just saying exactly
what had happened?
MR. KALMUS:

I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that the

crime was a shocking one.
QUESTION;

And the conduct of the assailant

That's not quite my question.

The

question is, if you objectively and calmly and quietly
described precisely what had happened, would that not shock
the - listener?
MR. KALMUS;
Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that it might have that effect

But it would be, in effect, based upon

the evidence.
Our

-quarrel hare is that the prosecution's

summation — Mr. McDaniel's summation — had nothing
whatever to do with the evidence.

And the state doesn’t

13
quarrel with that in their brief.
right.

They say yes, it's quite

Most of what he said had nothing to do with the

evidence.
QUESTION:

But at some point the defense even

talked about the animal that committed the crime.
MR. KALMUS:
QUESTION:

Justice Marshall —
I think you ought to separate the two.

MR, KALMUS:

At one point, one of the defense

counsel, in summation, and there were two on each side,
said that the assailant who would do these kinds of acts
would be an animal.

Of course,

he didn't attach that label

to the petitioner, who he said had not committed the acts
at all, which was in accord with the petitioner's testimony.
The prosecution picked up on that, and •—
QUESTION:

Well, you aren't really complaining

about that, areyou?
MR. KALMUS:

No, your Honor, that is one of the

..any items in summation which we have relegated to a footnote
somewhere in cur brief.

We complain

much more vigorously

about some of the other conduct in summation.
I think, just to get a little of the flavor of
it — and I don’t think you can get it entirely without
reading the summation in text, in full text — but one can
get a sense of it from just a few quotations from one of
McDaniel's themes, one that li-a began with? it's one that

14
he ended with.

And it is threaded throughout his argument.

As far as I'm concerned, he said, there should be
another defendant in this courtroom.

That is the division

of corrections, the prisons.
They had let him out on a weekend furlough? that
was the reason the issue came up.
As far as I'm concerned, he went on, this animal
was on the public for one reasons because the division of
corrections turned him loose, let him out, lets him on the
public.

Can't we expect them to stay in prison when they

go there?

Can't we expect them to stay locked up once they

go there?

Do we know they’re going to be out on the public

with guns, drinking?
Mr. Turman is dead because that unknown defendant
we don’t have in the courtroom allowed.

He’s criminally

negligent.
And then he went on to tie this into its significance
to the case.
And he said, the only way I know that he’s

not

going to get out on the public i.s to put him to death,
convict him of first degree murder.

It's the only way I

know, it's the only way I can be sure of it.
way that anybody can be sure of it
QUESTIONS

It's the only

now, because --

Is that by itself an improper argument

when you're dealing with a statute that constitutionally

15
authorizes the imposition of a death penalty, for a
prosecutor to say, the only way you can be sure this man
will not repeat this kind of an offense is to impose the
death penalty?
MR. KALMUS;

This was not in the punishment determi-

img stage of the trial, your Honor.
determining stage,

This was in the guilt

had I think --

QUESTION s

You would say it was not wrong in the

punishment determining stage, but it rs wrong in. the guilt
determining stage.
MR. KALMUS2

I'm not certain it would be appropriate

in the punishment determining stage, but I'm confident it
isn't appropriate when the court has not yet reached the stage
of the case.
And the passage that I have partially quoted goes
on much the same theme.
Again if one looks at some of his other themes; he
talks about the defendant and his, McDaniel’s wish

that

the defendant had been maimed or killed or shot himself or
blown his head off over and over again, he comes back to
that theme, obviously for no purpose other than to rouse up
the jury, to get them to decide this case without regard to
the evidence.
Again, there ,i s the theme of putting the prosecutor5 s
credibility itself at issue? something that every

court for

16
long, long — for many years has condemned»

And yet it was

done here over and over again by the prossoution, both by
prosecutor White and by prosecutor McDaniel saying,, I know
sure as I’m standing here? this man is guilty; McDaniel again
saying, why if I ware in the petitioner's shoes, I would have
lied like my teeth fell — until my teeth fell out also.
Remarks over and over again of that kind.
I think one can fairly conclude only that the
prosecution's misconduct v?as willful.

The state doesn't

dispute that.
And I think that's one of the key reasons here
why there must, be a reversal.
I'd like to turn to some comparison of this situation
with that in DeChristoforbin which Mr. Justice Rehnquist set
out a number of guidelines for dealing with this kind of an
issue.
Before 1 do that, I'd like to ask whether -here are
any questions that the Court would like to put with respect
to the procedural points that the state has raised, and
with which we have dealt in our reply brief.
Turning to the merits, then, in the comparison
with DeChristoforo, there were, I think, three criteria that
the Court thought crucial ii« .Dechristp.foro, crucial there
in finding that there was no denial of due process through
toprosecutor r u statement.

17
There, you. • 11 remember what the court was concerned
with was a one sentence, rather ambiguous remark, that
according to the First Circuit *— at least the majority in
the First Circuit .. had indicated to the jury, perhaps, that
the defendant had sought to plead guilty to some lesser crime
than first degree murder, and that the state — the prosecution
had turned him down.

So there was some implication of guilt.

It was a single sentence which this Court found
rather uncertain and ambiguous in its meaning, and of little
probable impact in the context of the entire case.
Three criteria that Mr. Justice Rehnquist spoke
about.

One was, how large a role did the prosecutor's conduct,

if one may call it that in DeChristoforo, occupy in the contexi;
of the whole summation? indeed, in. the context of the trial?
And. the answer there was, it was one sentence out of what the
Court characterised as a lengthy summation.
Here, we have quite the opposite.

Here, one has

35 typewritten pages of summation by prosecutor McDaniel, and
I tried to measure it, and I think you come down around 10,
12 pages if you cut out the irrelevancies, the ravings, the
carryings on about all kinds of matters that had nothing to
do with the case.
Secondly, dr. Justice Hehnquist focused in DeChristo*
foro on whether the prosecution's conduct was willful, or was
it a

misstatement in the heat of argument.

18
There it was fair to infer from the fact that a
single sentence was involved , and the judges in. the
Massachusetts Supreme Court# and the Federal District Court#
and the Court of Appeals, and hare, all disagreed about
what that one sentence probably conveyed to the jury.

It

was fair to conclude tb t the misstatement was accidental,
or just poor phrasing by the prosecutor in the context of
something that came out without prior planning»
Our case, no doubt about it. the state doesn't
contest it, this was a calculated, willrul effort to rouse
up the jury, to distract them from the evidence, to tell
them that --- what 1 am telling you, Mr. McDaniel was
saying, is relevant to your consideration„
QUESTION?

Well, areyou — you don't mean that

in its full sweep, what you just said, do you?

Supposing

the prosecutor in the midst of a 30 minute summary goes off

on a ten minute total irrelevancy about, you know, how the
weather's been the last few days.
prejudicial to the defendant.

But it’s not at all

Oon'c you have to combine the

two to make your argument?
MR. KALMAS:

I agree, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

if it had been of such palpable irrelevancy as what nice
weather we’ve been having, then, one would say without any
hesitation that maybe the prosecutor was a little crazy, font
that it had nothing to do with the case, the jury could not

19

have been, moved by.it, cr rational jurors would not have been
moved by it.
Our case doesn't fit that meld at all.

The

comments ~— the many, many comments of McDaniel were not off
to one side.

They were cut through from the beginning to

the end, number one.
Number two, they were not of such palpable
irrelevance that sensible jurors —- unsophisticated, but
people of average intelligence — would say, gee, obviously
that's got nothing to do with this case.
disregard it.

I°m going to

They wouldn't say that to themselves about

the kinds of things that McDaniel was going on about.

They

would say, and this Court said way back in Burger v. United
States, Justice Southerland's opinion, that the prosecutor
comas here not merely with official backing, but presumably
to do justice.

And therefore, I think, jurors would say to

themselves, we can cake it. that the things that he says have
some relevance to our consideration of this man's guilt or
innocence.
And I think that: if you read these remarks in
context, one must suppose, one can't avoid supposing, that anv
averaqe group of jurors would have so understood the remarks,
an<; would have taken them into account in deciding whatever
they decided.
QUESTION:

If the prosecutor had just go a transcript:

20

of the testimony,, the prosecutions testimony of the survivors,
and, in effect, read that to the jury,

Ptould you he

complaining about his — the outrageous character of his argu­
ments?
MR. KATiMTTS:

I don't think that I could complain if

the prosecution had confined itself to the evidence.
evidence, in this case, was terrible.

That

And the evidence vras

a legitimate consideration to the jury in deciding whether to
convict or to acquit.
I think that when the prosecutor willfulIv departed
into matters that were obviously not evidence, were not related
to the evidence, that then, indeed, there is a right to com­
plain, and there is a right to have a trial free of that
emotional kind of diatribe.
I think, just in closing, that Justice Stevens made
the point just last week in Gardner, and the statement was
quoted this morning, to the effect that the communitv as well
as the

defendant are entitled to have a trial conducted in a

intelligent, equitable, non-emotional fashion, and to have
a jury decide the case without the interjection of improper
emotional factors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. PROSPECT, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF TTTE RESPONDENT.
MR. PROSPECT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and mav it please

the Court:
My name is Richard Prospect, and I'm appearing here
on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Florida.
I've just sat here for the last fifteen minutes and
listened to the number of times with which Mr. Kalmus has
attributed to the State, the Respondent in this cause, with
admitting, conceding and otherwise not contestina the fact
that the statements that appear in this record that were
uttered during the closing argument of the State's

Ccise

are

irrelevant, outrageous, ridiculous and otherwise as having
no place in any trial in our state our any other.
7 replied to him by saving, what else could I do?
.

The statements are there.
that they're not.

I'm not about to tell the Court

I’m not about to tell the Court thev mean

something ether than the plain meaning of their words c**-e.
My question is, or ray position, is: of those portions
of the remarks that absolutely are irrelevant to any business
at hand, there is nothing that can be said except, were thev
■

prejudicial to this defendant?
The other portions that were more or less listed
in the petitioner's dissection on the argument are, at. least
in part, in response to certain things that the jury heard

22

first by defense counsel.
Now, the mention about the division of

I'm

sorry, the mention about, the only way I know this man
is not going to get back out on the public is to sentence him
to death; now that came in response to something defense
counsel started off in the first argument the jury heard.
If you'll read that you’ll find that Mr. Maloney, the first
defense counsel, stated that, ladies and nentlemen, on the
evidence the State has presented today, they are asking you
to kill my client.
Now, McDaniel quickly corrected that misimpression.
He very clearly and substantially told the jury that, ladies
and gentlemen we're not here to do that right now.

We're

here to determine guilt or innocence, arid nothing else.
We have a second stage of the proceeding in which
I will ask for the death penalty, and lam going to ask for
it, because that's the only way I know to keep this man off
the streets.
Now, that's something we can justify, because it is
in response to what occurred.
The other matters -— and let's not nihoick over
any of them, let's not re-read them, or anything else.
know they're there.

You know they're there.

I

Let's decide

whether they deprived this man of a fair trial.
Mow, anybody, and probably everybody who is familiar

23

with this record will quickly agree that these arguments
had no place there.

Everybody except defense cousnel.

It's not until the last page, as it appears in the appendix,
does that objection occur.

Why is this?

They were either asleep, they didn’t think anything
was wrong with the remarks, or

and T believe this comes

into the rationale of the Estelle and Francis cases — they
thought perhaps we just go t reversible error.

It doesn't

take a legal' wizard to sit there and listen to the man take
off and — in a rant, and know that something is not ricrht.
QUESTION:

Can you conceive of a lawyer not objecting?

HR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

Defense counsel?

MR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

Well, no, I can.

I can if —

Yes.

MR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

No, I cannot.

Well, can you —

MR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

Ho, I cannot.

— as I was about to say —•

Yes.

MR. PROSPECT:

— if they think they’ve got

reversinla error.
QUESTION:

But even at that —

MR. PROSPECT;

Because that’s on the backside.

Up front they've got a shot at the verdict.
QUESTION:

You’d make an objection, Darden*a

24

lawyer would?

What I’rn driving at is, why is it that

petitioner doesn’t raise the question of ineffective assistance
of counsel?

^hat's what I don't understand.

And he doesn't

raise it.
Wh. PROSPECT:
when he gets hack.

Perhaps Mr. Kalmus can answer that

I don't know.

QUESTION:

And he doesn't raise it.

MR. PROSPECT:

Well, is it ineffective?

If he

doesn't object, thinking they've crot a shot at the verdict?
I mean, if he's right today when he says that the evidence
was close — I don't happen to agree, but if he's right -QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Prospect.

MR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Your opponent also made the point, there's

no objection until toward the end of the argument.

But

there was an objection on the second page of the argument,
on page 122,

Of course,, it's to the argument not being supported

by evidence in the record.

But that’s the Fmbstance of much

of his criticism of the argument.
MR. PROSPECT:

Well, no, it’s really a very pointed

and specific objection.
QUESTION:

He says, now I object,

^here's been

no testimony to this.
MR. PROSPECT:.

Exactly,

I'm sorry, I believe Mr.

Darden -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
QUESTION: That's on the second page of the argument.
So he did start to object right away.
MR. PROSPECT:

But not on the basis of anything

being inflammatory or prejudicial.

Apparently, McDaniel

misstated something, something of no consequence.
Mr. Goodwill said, there’s been no testimony.

And

MR. PROSPECT.
QUESTION:

1 beg your pardon, sir.

The court's disposition of the objection

was, well, the jury’s heard the evidence.

It can decide

for itself.
Mr. PROSPECT:

Well, I don’t think it indicates

any prejudice toward the defendant.
QUESTION:

It is a fact.

And that’s the way the judge handled

the second objection, too.
MR. PROSPECT;

No, that second objection, as I

pointed out in the brief, is really nothina more than a
request that the man stick to what evidence he had.

Now,

apparently — we’ve got to remember, you want to ao to the
beginning of things, go to the very beginning, and we see that
Mr. Maloney says, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve been here
five days.

We’ve got a long trial.

And after — or in

response to the statement, the only thing he hasn't done
that I know of is cut his throat.

All right.

Maloney

gets on his feet and says, your honor, that's about the
fifth time that he has commented that he wished someone would
shoot this man or that he would kill himself.

I wish the

court would instruct Mr. McDaniel to stick with what
little evidence he has.
And then ar; perhaps a less than professional
response, McDaniel comes back with, you don’t have any
evidence yourself, Mr. Maloney.

27

Now, we can't get the feel of this on the printed
page, but apparently the court was fed up with that and
replied, all right, gentlemen, proceed with your argument»

QUESTION:

The judge apparently wasn't offended by
He overruled that objection, too.

He

just said, go ahead with the argument.
MR. PROSPECT:

Well, he overruled a request for

an instruction that McDaniel stick with what little evidence
he had.

That is the only form of a quote objection unquote.

He didn’t say, I object, your honor, on the basis, it is
prejudicial, inflammatory or unconstitutional, and I want a
mistrial, or I want at least a curative instruction

Had. he

clone that, he would have given the trial court the opportunity
to rectify any error that was happening.
QUESTION:

Your view is the trial judge wouldn't

recognise there was anything improper about this argument?
Without the counsel explaining it to him?
MR. PROSPECT:
recognize it.

No, no I’m not coinq to say he couldnt

I’m sure he did.

QUESTION:

But the objection didn’t prompt any

curative instruction at all.
MR. PROSPECT:
QUESTION:

He didn’t ask for it.

Wouldn’t you have thought the trial

judge would have had some — what?

MR. PROSPECT5

He didn’t ask for a curative

instruction.
QUESTION:

Well, but you're saving that the

judge had to have that explained to him, or the judge didn't
realize it was necessary.
MR. PROSPECT»

Mo, I think there’s two different

things: what the judge realized, and what he was asked to do.
QUESTION;

Do we have any — there's also discussion

off the record, about page 127 — Mr*

Goodwill said in one

of his examinations, I believe of Mrs. Hill — and there
apparently was another interruption there.

It seems to me

there were perhaps three interruptions of closing argument —
of counsel during the argument.
MR. PROSPECT:

I can’t, and don't, read it that

0

way, sir,,

I don't know what that indicates.

It only

indicates to me that McDaniel stopped his argument r there
was a discussion off the record, between whom, we do not
know; and he continued.
QUESTION:

Is it the practice in Florida, when

one objects to closing argument, always to do so orally
in the presence of the jury?

Or is it sometimes done, -you

try to have a side bar and not make such a fuss?

Because

it's rather rude to interrupt counsel, as you know.

MR. PROSPECT:

29

objections are made in front of the jury.

And generally,

I really don’t recall the necessity for havina them taken out
of the courtroom in order to discuss something.

I believe

the objection, on whatever the grounds it’s based on, is
aired before thejury.
QUESTION;

You would not think it's fair to infer that

the discussion off the record on page 127 might have
related to the content of the closing argument?
MR. PROSPECT;

No, sir, it may just as well have

related to a conference between McDaniel and his co-counsel
as to what he was going to say next, for all we know.

I mean,

it just doesn't show that, one way or the other.
Now, we have taken the position, of course, that
it's one thing for a prosecuting attorney to prejudice a
defendant by his closing arguments, and it's another thing to
inflame them, and it's quite another thing, but the same,
to go outside the evidence when he does the other two.
That is why we propose that threefold test,,

And

we've submitted it to the Court — for the Court's
consideration •— in determining proper guidelines to let all
concerned know what it is that is proper and what is not
proper closing argument at least on behalf of a prosecutor.
We don’t seem to have that restriction on defense.
Now, as we stated, without an objection, there was
no chance to straighten out the jury.

Now, in a nutshell.

30

in a paragraph in the brief, we stated that petitioner has
claimed that by engaging in all this irrelevant matter, and this
ridiculous argument, the jury — he

referred to them inhis

brief and in his reply as rural, as coming from rural
Florida -- he's implied that they were so malleable and
receptive to this type of argument, that they automatically,
more or less, and necessarily, went back in their jury room
and based their verdict on what Mr. McDaniel said.

They

disregarded the evidence, and they were so moved by the man's
tirade that they came in with a verdict based -— with guilty,
based on that.
However, he fails to mention. , either today, or
in reply, the fact

that Goodwill got up after all this

nonsense and said, ladies and gentleman, we're not here to

That5 s what the judge told them in the very
beginning.

He neutralized any effect.

And I dispute that

those people ware so receptive to being improperly influenced.
Now, I personally take dispute with the rural
Floridian aspect of this case.
it wasn't mentioned today.

It's appeared twice, but

But. nonetheless, it was in the

31

reply brief.
The case was tried in Citrus County, Florida.
It is not like Jacksonville or Miami.

Apparently, petitioner

is of the opinion that anybody who comes from that area and
who would sit on a jury in a murder case would be the
rural type.
Now, to me, rural means farm and/or country.

And

it's very interesting because we Floridians who are from
that state know one thing, and that is, there are very few
natives.

Most of us are transplanted.
If we look at the jury selection on the whole —
QUESTION:

I missed it.

And the town?

MR. PROSPECT:

Very pretty, but not large.
QUESTION:

I know7 where it is.

MR. PROSPECT:

So if we look — if we look at the

jury selection as a whole and we examine the jurors who sat,
we see that Mrs. Macy is a native of Ohio? her husband is
retired Army.

Mr. Dorminy has been in Crystal River since 1971,

Mr. Carhuff is from New

Mr. Schneider is

from Illinois? he lived in Florida for six years.

Mr. Hudson may be a native? he doesn't

All that his questioning reveals is that he works as

a construction laborer.

Mrs. Mulroy is someone perhaps

more to petitioner's liking? she happens to come from
Queens, New York City.
QUESTION:

That's not rural.

MR. PROSPECT?

Exactly, sir.

Her husband was a

30 year FBI regional director before ha retired, and they
lived in as many as 14 different places from Nebraska to
this city here today to Virginia and Westchester.

And T

believe that's either in the State of New York or Connecticut,

QUESTION?

It’s not rural, either.

MR. PROSPECT?

Mr. Pelellat is a retired fireman
He's lived in Citrus County since

We have Mrs. Harm, H-a-n-n, who lives in Crystal

River, but she was a retired supervisor from the Security
First National Bank of Los Angeles, California.

And finally,

Mr. Waller, nine years with and living in Citrus County
with the County Road Department maintenance crew.

33

So we've got two people who may be natives who
may possibly represent rural people from rural Florida,,
whatever that means.

We lock at the other people who

were not selected for the jury and we have everyone coming
from — we have people coming everywhere from California to
New Hampshire? we have a marine biologist from Texas,
Indiana, Orlando? a schoolteacher from Orlando from Indiana?
and two other people who had been in the area from five
to two years.
*

So we simply just don't have whatever is supposed
to be — he's supposed to mean by a rural jury.

And I think

the jury and it's composition and it's possible effect —
ox- the effect of the argument on this jury ~ has to be
considered very closely tied with the necessity and the
rationale behind an objection.
If these people are going to be swayed, than
we've got to stop it as soon as it begins.

But if they're

not, then they can be rehabilitated by what counsel said
in his response, in his rebutting closing argument, where
ho repeated, listen, ladies and gentlemen, only to the evidence.
Forget this wild man over here.
but to decide guilt or innocence.

We're not here to do anything
And we of course concluded

our discussion of the jury with, based on this profile,
Now this is just — this only reflects the
questions and answers which would indicate where the people

34
are from and what they do.

Now, this doesn't reflect their

responses to other questions.

Standard jury questions which

are asked in all cases relative to predisposition to quilt/
innocence, notoriety of the case, and so forth.

You'll

see some very intelligent answers, especially those relating
to Witherspoon.

You'll see some very intelligent people.

And we submit that these people were sophisticated
enough to know that when McDaniel took off, that's all ha was
doing, taking off.

And it was perhaps •— they viewed him

with legal egg on his face, if that's a possible phrase to
use,
We just don't think that they were persuaded to
rush to judgment, put that verdict as guilty, and come back
out and say, well, based on our being inflamed, we reacted
from our heart and not our head.
I just don't believe that.

And I've got an idea

that they didn’t believe it either or else they would have
objected.

Now, they would have at least gotten up there and

said, your honor, would you please step this man —* or I object
on the grounds of this.

Let's stop it.

But perhaps they did try to take a shot at the
verdict, knowing that they had reversible error.

Because

you've got to remember, isn't it always good, if you’re
on the defense side, to get a new trial, especially in a
capital case.

35

Wow, if they were convinced it was reversible error,
they know they've got to go to the Florida Supreme Court.
That Court hears all capital cases, as wall as everything
else.

It takes time.
We conceivably could have had a reversal occurred,

had to try this man within five years or more from the
offense, or more.

The second trial is always fun.

You've

You've always

got the possibility, even with available witnesses, dimming
memories.
And every witness you've got against you, yon
can automatically ask, you mean to tell me to tell me you
can remember something that clearly that happened four, five
or six years ago.
It's a good shot to try and get that reversal in
the second trial.

And it's an even better shot to try for

the acquittal, because then you can go home that day.
And I think that the issue involved here considering
the lack of objection, considering the very thing they're
yelling about the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KALMUS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KALMUS2

I think that what the State is asking

i

here is that the prosecutor be given license to procede
willy nilly in whatever fashion he may and on whatever grounds
he may wish to* and put the defense counsel in the box,
standing up and objecting everytime something .is said , or
letting it go by.
We all know that that's a difficult lawyer’s
decision to make in context.

But here the State is

saying,

even though the prosecutor willfully makes outrageous
arguments that he

has no business making and he knows he

has no business making, still the defense counsel is going
to be kept in that box.
And it seems to us that that’s not a tactical choice
that can fairly be imposed against willful misconduct by
prosecution.

As to your question Mr. Justice Marshall, as to
why there was no ineffective assistance of counsel
