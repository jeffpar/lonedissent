ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER •
MR. BORKs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals to the District of Columbia Circuit.

That court,

sitting en banc, held with one dissent that the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction
to entertain Respondent Pressley's application for a writ of
habeas corpus seeking post-conviction relief.
The conviction from which he seeks relief occurred
in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and. we
contend that the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter­
tain such applications.
The issue is obviously uncertain, one, to the
objectives Congress sought to attain in the 1970 reorganisation
of the court system in the District of Columbiaj a major part
of that reform and reorganisation was intended to relieve the
district court system of local criminal law enforcement.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals which we seek
to have reversed brings the

district court back in part into

local criminal law matters.
The issue in this case is, first, the meaning and
second, the constitutionality of Section 110(g) of Title III
of the District of Columbia Code
■Va thxnk it is rather clear that Section 110(g)
deprived the district court of jurisdiction over application
for habeas corpus by chose whc rave been convicted in the
superior court.
The Cour:.; of Appeals held to the contrary that 110{g)
•!
•

'

-

is a yuara exhaustion ox remedies provision so that' .prisoners
must seek relief initially in the superior court but may then,
if that relief is denied, proceed into the district-court
with the same application.
Now, in construing the statute, the Court of Appeals
stated, indeed, insisted that its' interpretation was heavily
influenced by its desire to avoid constitutional issues which
it regarded as troublesome.
I wish to urge two propositions.

The first is that

Section 110(g) is so clear and so unambiguous in denying
jurisdiction to the federal districts in a case such as this
one that no amount of constitutional concern can justify
interpreting the statute as a mere exhaustion of remedies
provision.

It is clear what Congress has done and there is no

5
legitimate w<. y to avoid oo . stitufcianal issues if constitutional
issues there be.
My second point, therefore, is that 110(g) of the
District Code passes the relevant constitutional test and dees
so relatively easily.
I would like to turn first to the statutory question,
110 as a general matter gives the superior court the power to
entertain collateral attack upon its own sentences and that
power is just as broad in scope and is the same nature as a
collateral attack would be in a federal district court under
2255, tor example.
Now, the relevant language to this case which is in
110(g) is this:
"An application for a writ of iubeas corpus shall not
be entertained by any federal court if it appears that the
applicant has failed to make a motion for relief under this
section or that the superior court has denied him relief.”

I can think of no way that language could be made
clearer.

No federal court may entertain a superior court

convict's habeas corpus petition if the convict has not made a
motion in the superior court or if he has done so and has lost.
There are two clauses.
of remedies provision,

The first one is an exhaustion

The second one is clearly a denial of

jurisdiction provision and to read the second clause as a mere
exhaustion of remedies provision is to read it out of the

6
statute which, I submit, is- not interpretation.

It is a

repeal *
This is not a oa-se like Gusik against Schilder where
the Court thought it would have required a strain to read the
finality language as other chan an exhaustion of remedies
provision and it refused to strain the language in order to
reach a constitutional issue.
I thin'k that this can be made clear if you ask your­
self whci would C ngress do if it meant this to be a denial
of jurisdiction*

tvnat would it do afuer the Court of Appeals

decision on order to make that fart uiear?
£

can't think of anything that would make it

clearer unless it italicised that language in the Code and
then said, we real1^ msaa tea italicized language.
It hac done as nu ...

as it can to make this plain.

Now, there is much argument about the legislative
history in this case.

The truth is

there is very little

legislative history in this case that is very enlightening
but the Court of Appeals and, to some extent, Respondent, used
an argument which — use a. wide variety of arguments none of
which in the legislative his -ory real; ly go to overturn the
language in the text but we So know two things.

We do know

that Congress intended to remove 1coal matters from the
federal district, courts.,
We know that the statute does that as we read it

7
and that supports it.

But wore importantly is the fact that

Section 110(g) is modeled.

Congress said it was using as a

model 28 U.S.C. 2255 and, indeed, tna language is almost
identical.
We Know that 2255, the post-conviction relief statute,
is not an exhaustion of remedies statute,
tional statute,

it says that yot must go back to the sentencing

court to get your post-conviction relief.
else and

it is a jurisdic­

You may go no place

in that sense it removes jurisdiction from all other

courts hut the sentencing court.
110(g) copies that language and removes jurisdiction
from any courts other than the sentencing court which, in this
case, is the

superior court.

i suppose if there is any differs', re between the
two — and there is

it is that 110(g) is even clearer

because whereas 2255 simply says that the motion shall not be
entertained. language '/as added to 110 (g) in the District Code
and it says the motio;

shall not foe entertained by the superior

court or by any federal or state court, which nails it down.
Now, against all of this, the Court of Appeals really
places reliance upon two points.

The first one is that the

local court system in the District of Columbia, the Article I
court system was intended to be, in many respects, analagous to
a state court system and that is quite true, but an analogy is
by no means an identity.

3

This sy&tei.i di-- irars iv.

-uny respects and one of them

is the respect which is plainly before us here.
The second point of reliance was that Congress could
not have meant what it plainly said because that would have
provoked heated constitutional debate and there was none.

The

answer to that is that there was no constitutional excitement
because Congress had done the same thing 20 years before and
there had been no constitutional excitement about that and it
probably could plainly do the same thing again.
*

In 22515 —• under 2255» collateral stacks upon
sentences imposed by territorial, courts organized under
Article IV' of the Constitution — a non-Arfcicle III court -—
must be brought exclusively by motion in those courts» which
parallels the situation here.
No court has suggested that it would be unconstitu­
tional to send those — that it is unconstitutional to require
a person convicted in a territorial court to go back for his
post-conviction relief under 2255 to that sentencing court so
there was no occasion for Congress to think that there was
anything unique or exciting or troublesome about what it was
doing in this statute.
I think the statutory argument is clear so I’ll turn
to the constitutional argument.
Now» the constitutional objection really is that
although Respondent may be constitutionally convicted and

9

sentenced in an Article X court created for the District of
Columbiaf he may not be required to seek his post-conviction
relief in that same court.

X think this court's decision in

the United States against Palmore effectively disposes of that
contention.
It is implausible that a. person who can be

tried

initiallyf constitutionally in such a court may not have his
post-conviction relief motion determined by such a court.
1 think that is enough of the case but the argument
is dressed up here toy the statement thav to require a convict
to go back to the superior court is co suspend the

privilege

of the writ of habeas corpus which cone;:.'avenes Article I,
Section 9» clause 2

tne Constitution and also» the Court of

Appeals suggested, Contravenes the equal protection concept of
the due process clause
Neither of tnese claims. 1' think, is plausible after
Palmore but X*1I say a few words to them.
The suggestion that 110(g) violates the suspension
clause is disposed of quite quickly, X think.

It is our posi­

tion, expressed in our brief, that history shows that the
guarantee of the suspension clause was not intended to apply
to any postconviction applications for habeas corpus.
At the time the Constitution was drafted and adopted,
the commonlaw rule was that a post-conviction application for
habeas corpus could be defeated by showing that there was a

10
judgment for conviction by a. criminal court of general juris­
diction and that is our position, so that Congress would be
free if it wished to suspend the writ entirely, but we don't
rest upon chat»
Our main point -

we may not *.each that historical

point because our main point is that it is clear that what was
done here was in no sense a suspension of the privilege of the
writ»

Its exact — the motion under 110(g) or under 110 is

exactly commensurate with the writ of habeas corpus as it is
exactly commensurate wit.

.255 sc that is no suspension of

the writ in this case»
The nature of the relief is the same.
upon which it may be sought are the same

The grounds

The procedure is

the same and the only difference that is pointed to is that
the court considered the motion as created under Article I
rather than under Article III.
As I say, i think Palmore answers that contention
because if an Article 1 court, given the special powers of
Congress over the District of Columbia, is capable of providing
a legitimate constitutional trial, I think it is capable of
providing a legitimate constitutional post-conviction review.
Besides, it is clear that we are dealing — that the
purpose of the suspension clause was to prevent the effective
denial of the writ altogether and was not to regulate or to
prohibit Congress from regulating the details, the procedural

11
details.
Otherwise# if that is not feme

we are going to get

into questions about whether the new rules which allow' the
dismissal of a motic .# whechai delay in this filing prejudices
the government# whether than is a suspension of the privilege
of the writ or, as the rules were reasonably promulgated# 1
understand that they required that an application under 2255
be sworn to under oath.
1' suppose we would have an argument about what was
essential to the writ and 1 think it is quite clear that those
procedural details are not put beyond Congress' power by the
suspension clause and certainly hare# wnen you have federal
judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate
tc 15-year terms and with a postconviction procedure which is
specified by tha Congress and it
habeas corpus, it seems t:

is as broad as the writ

of

me that it is impossible to say

that there is any suspension of the writ.
The Court of Appeals entertained some speculations
about the Equal Protection concept which Respondent has not
pressed here particularly but I think I should mention them
in any event because they are in the opinion below.
The theory, apparently, is that equal protection may
be in question because under 28 U.S. Code 2254, a person
convicted in the state court may petition an Article III court
for postconviction collateral attack while a superior court

12

convict in the District of Columbia must petition an Article I
court.
It seems to me that this is nothing more than the
suspension clause argument all over again and that once more
and for that reason it is answered by the Palmora decision,
The argument, whether it is on the suspension clause
or whether it is placed in this equal protection concept
context, is always

always contains the hidden assumption

that the superior court is less legitimate in some ways than
an Article III court is and if that assumption is rejected, as
it was in Palmore, then I think there is no equal protection
is «me here, just as there is no suspension clause issue here.
And I think, that is the end of the matter but I
suppose there are a few other points that should be mentioned.
The equal protection concept obviously doesn’t
encompass the right to be tried in a particular tribunal.
If the remedies available are equal, then I think
there is no problem.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't there a little more to the

equal protection argument than you suggest in that prisoners
who are convicted in any of the states forums, which are
presumably legitimate, nonetheless have the right to petition
a federal district court for habeas and, in effect, someone
convicted in the District of Columbia Court is the only person
who does not have the right to petition a federal district

13
court for habeas?
MR. BORKs

Well, I -think, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, that

that is the argument as I understand it but X think the argu­
ment necessarily resus upon the premise that even in the
District of Columbia where the Congress has special powers
under Section 1, there is something less legitimate about an
Article 1' court than there is — less legitimate about an
Article I court than an Article III court because if that
assumption is not present, than there is really no denial of
equar protection»
QUESTION:

Well, there is no difference then between

this defendant and a federal defendant.
MR. BORE:

.n the sense -chat federal defendant is

remitted to the sentencing court’?
QUESTION:

Wail, he goes 2255.

He goes through an

Article 111 court cut he can't go two places.
MRo BORK;

That is true in that sense»

QUESTION I

And -cua state prisoner can go to state

habeas and he can go to federal habeas.
MR. BORK:

That is true and if the Court of Appeals

decision were upheld in that sense, Mr, Justice White, prisoners
here would be better off than prisoners under 2255 if one
considers that being better off because they would get both a
local system and a federal system.
QUESTION:

So X suppose we would have —

They would be better off if you would

14
treat them the same as-if they were state prisoners.
If you — I think the conclusion we are coming to,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that, no matter which way one goes,
if one adopts a rather artificial view of this matter, there
will be the denial of equal protection because if the Court
of Appeals — well, 2254 prisoners

go from a state system to

a federal system and therefore it is said by the Court of
Appears, prisoners here should go from the Article I system to
the federal Article I1X system but Mr . Justice White points
out that that would ~

if chat is an advantage which one is

entitled to examine unbar the equal protection concept, which
I deny

Mr. Justice White points out that that would then

create a disparity which one would have to examine because
persons who were entitled to go

from an Article I court to an

Article III court would be better off — in some sense, they
have two systems — better off than those proceeding under
2255 who are always in tne federal court and go right back to
the sentencing court for their postconviction relief.
QUESTION:

But if the prisoner feels he is getting

the best in the first place, he isn't concerned about having
been denied what he regards, at least, as less than the best,
that is, less than an Article III judge.
MR. BORK:

Well, that is true.

I think Palmore says

that an Article I court in the District of Columbia, given the
powers that the Congress has in the District and given the way

15
it has established these courts, is not an inferior.
QUESTION:

Well, it is one thing, is it not,

Hr. Solicitor General, to say what kind of a judge you must have
to try the case in the first instance and perhaps another thing
to say what kind of a judge must be given jurisdiction for
habeas corpus?

That is, that would analogize it for the state

situation versus the federal, would it not?
MR. BORK:

Well, I suppose, Hr. Chief Justice.

You

see, here, I think, if one makes the scate analogy there is, I
think there is a clear difference between this and the states.
That is, Congress has created this court system with
many safeguards that some scate systems do not have and Congress
has prescribed a careful sec or post-conviction remedies that
many spates do not have.
QUESTION:

Wei!: , you emphasize the 15-year tenure.

Suppose the tenure of judges in the District of Columbia were
three years instead of 15 years?
MR. BORK:

Well, I don’t know off-hand that that

would of itself make a difference but it should be noted, of
course, that 110(g), like 2255, provides that if the federal
court regards the procedures as inadequate and ineffective,
then it may entertain the writ of habeas corpus so that should
conditions change with respect to the District of Columbia
courts, the statute by its terms allows access to the Article
III courts.

16
I don’t know if that is a sufficient answer to the
question you put to me, out I am basically saying, if we are
required to assume that there is a difference with constitu­
tional significance or which rises to a level of constitutional
notice between the Article III courts and the rest of the
country and the Article I courts in the District of Columbia,
then I think there is a very rational reason why Congress has
treated them somswhac differently and chat rational reason is
that Congress has no control over the state court systems or
the is; p os t-c onvi ct ion remedies .

General Bork, do you mink it would be

prisoners, that there shall be no habeas corpus petition enter­
tained unless the federal court first determines that the state
collateral attack procedure was ineffective?
MR. BORK:

Well, I think — I would like to answer

that, but let me make clear that I don't think that that is
involved, necessarily at all involved with the decision in
this case.
QUESTION:
case as well

Your answer one way would control this

17

MR. BORK:

Well, I have speculated —

QUESTION:

Because you relied on this ineffective

exception in the statutory language here in one of your answers
a minute ago.

What I am saying is, if that is an adequate

answer that, you know, the very last phrase in the statute
that you just referred to, that would take care of the whole
case,
MR. BORK:

Well, let me go into that, Mr. Justice

Stevens and see if I understand the problem.

I had speculated,

and this is speculation and I suppose one shouldn't engage in
that, but I will because I don't think it is directly relevant
aere, that Congress might be able constitutionally to say that
those states which adopt a post-conviction relief statute which
is like 2255 with all of those procedures and mechanisms and
meets certain other criteria in our judicial system, shall be
freed of 2255 and post-conviction relief will be in those courts
but otherwise you have access in it to the federal court under
22 55 .
QUESTION:

Well, not 2255, really.

Freedom under

2254 is what I should have said.
MR. BORK:

I5m sorry.

Quite right.

Quite right.

QUESTION:

Yes, that is what I meant.

MR. BORK:

Quite right.

QUESTION:

It would have to be adequate.

QUESTION:

If it were adequate.

MR. BORK:

It would-have to be adequate and that

would be an example of - • that is why I say I think Congress
could constitutionally in that case turn over the post-convic­
tion relief to a non-Article III court where to prescribe the
adequate procedure and that is precisely what it has done here.
QUESTION:

That would not be regarded as a suspension

of the writ because the office of the writ would be performed
by the state system

whereas here it is performed by the

District of Columbia syscam.
MR. BGRK:

Quite rightP Mr. Justice Stevens.

In

fact, it could not be regarded as a suspension of the writ
because Congress is free .....c to have any lower federal courts,,
no district courts or courts of appeals.
Constitution,

We know that from the

from Article III itself and so, turning matters

over to the state co ,rts

ns we did throughout much of our

history, federal questions, would not be a suspension of the
writ if the writ is adequate.
But that is our basic presentation.
statute cannot be gotten away from.

I think the

1 think that it says as

clearly as words can ever say it, that the district

court

here has no jurisdiction.
I think the constitutional arguments are basically
answered by Palmore with the additional observations I have
made at the moment and for that reason we ask that the judgment
of the Court of Appeals be reversed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Foster.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. FOSTER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FOSTER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
My name is Mark Foster and I represent the Respondent
Jasper C. Pressley,,
Mr. Pressley contends here in this Court today, as
he has from the day when he was arrested back in 1971, that he
is innocent of the charges of which he was convicted in this
case and that given the reasonably effective assistance of an
attorney that he can establish that he is not guilty of these
charges.
Now, the merits of his claim that he was denied

the

effective assistance of counsel are not before this Court; not
before this Court because whan Mr, Pressley went to the federal
district courts, the Article III courts in the District of
Columbia it present his federal constitutional questions, he
found that; the doors of the courthouse were closed against him.
That is to say,, that his petition for writ of habeas
corpus was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
Now, let me ask the Court to consider this dismissal
on jurisdictional grounds in the context in which it arises.
There is a general federal statute that says in its
•::erms that the United States District Court for the District of

Columbia Circuit —* that is, the District Court here in the
District, like all other United States' District Courts, has
the jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions on behalf of
persons who are in confinement by color under the authority of
the United States.
There is a», affi:, native statute which grants that
jurisdiction.
Now, according to the government, tucked away in a
remote corner of the new District of Columbia Code, is a statute
which carves out a small exception to the general federal
statute and that statute is the statute which is before this
Court today, 23 D.C» Code Section 110(g).
budge Taran, joined by writing for eight judges of
v.he Uni ted -"tates Com. • of Appeals for '.he District of Columbia
Circuit, found that cue statute did not have the effect that
the government urged upon this Court,

Judge Tamm and the

judges of the Court of Appeals found that the government*s
argument suffers from two principal vices.
The first is that they force upon this statute a
result that Congress never intended and let me take exception
with the respected Solicitor General,

This Court has said that

there can be no rule of law which requires that a statute be
given an effect that Congress never intended, no matter how
clear the words may appear on their surface.
And the second vice found by the Court of Appeals --

21

QUESTION:

Sometimes it would be quite an undertaking

to prove that the Congress did not intend what it said,
wouldn't it?
. MRo FOSTER:

I think it is often a difficult task,

your Honor, but this is an area particularly where this Court
has felt that it is incumbent upon the Court to examine these
statutes with great care as they work together in the context
of the protection of federal rights and in many instances, this
Court has

said this language cannot be read literally, it

must be read in context and I am only asking the Court to
apply that same general — I believe there is a tradition of
interpretation of federal habeas corpus statutes that they will
be examined closely to make sure that they are given the effect
that Congress intended.
QUESTION:

Now —

Mr.

roster, are you conceding, then, that

the literal language of the statute is against you?
MK. FOdTER:

Your Honor, "1 do not feel that there is

any grammatical reading of these words which yields the result
that I desire.
However, 1 don't think that this Court sits to decide
questions of grammar.

It sits to decide questions of law and

the question is, in the context of these statutes does this
statute have the effect that the government urges?
I think one thing must be clear and that is, that
when one looks to Congress' expressed intention in passing the

22

statute, there is no shred of evidence that Congress intended
this statute to have the effect that the government urges
upon this Court.

That is —*

statute arose.
There was consi­

derable debate as to the possibility of reorganizing the courts
in the District of Columbia.
The Justice Department came forward with a proposal
for the reorganization of the courts in the District of
Columbia.

This statute was part of the Justice Department’s

proposal to Congress.

23
The Justice Department explainer! to Congress what the
statute ii&ant and Congress adopted the Justice Department' s
explanation of what the statute meant in so many words and the
'exact words which were picked up from the report that accom­
panied this statute when it was presented to Congress, carried
on through the «Senate, through the House, through the Conference
Report are these:
Section 110 is new.

Rather than reylinq upon the

inherent power of the superior court to review judgments of
convictions, the new section provides statutory procedures for
post-conviction challenges„
"Section 110 is modeled upon 28 U.S.C. Section 2255

with only the necessary technical changes.°

discussed in the legislative history.

Those cases are

There is no discussion

of any aspect of any of these constitutional questions that we
think are stirred at a later point.

I think, if you turn to the oral presentation that
the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Kleindienst pave when he
presented this hill, the reference becomes even clearer.
He said that Title IV, of which this section is a
part, is a sort of general grab bag of miscellaneous investi­

He said this title,"Most of the sections

are merely restatements of existing law and wherever

appro­

priate, the language of -ederaj. statutes or federal rules has
been used."
And then when he got to 110 in particular, he said,
"Although the local court may have inherent power in the
matter of post-conviction remedies, a special procedure was
created to eliminate unnecessary,

litigation and to add certainty

to the law."
Once again, that has an obvious reference to the
Burke case.

It was suggested by counsel in the Burke case

that the Court, if it relied upon its inherent power to review
judgments,would leave counsel and litigants with no guidance
and that the Court should suggest some rules and some

procedures and the Court declined to clo so in the Burke case,
saying that —

QUESTION:

MR. FOSTER:

I don't think it would come up very

often because normally people tried to get to the Article III
courts by certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals,
this old procedure which is gone here, so an exhaustion, I
don't think would arise as a problem very often in that context.
I know of no case
QUESTION:

HR. FOSTER:

Well, X think that

one can trace out

the history, the intellectual history of this statute relative­
ly easily.

If you want to say that there is a motion in the

local courts and it is a simple, modern post-conviction motion,
where do you look?

You look to the federal statute which sets

up such a motion in the federal courts and if you apply that
language without looking at it terribly carefully, the last
paragraph may have an effect that you don’t intend if your
purpose, as Congress said it was, was simply to set up such a
procedure in the local courts and I —
QUESTIONx

Wasn’t the superior court setting up this

whole set-up at the same time?

There was nothing before that,

was there?
HR, FOSTER:

There were local Article I courts here

in the District.

MR, FOSTER:

Ho, but they weren’t superior courts.
No, it was the Court of General Sessions,

the Police Court —
QUESTION:
MR. FOSTER:

They are entirely different.
Yes, but there were non-Article III

courts here in the District of Columbia that sat and people
convicted in chose local, non-Article III courts, once they

had, presumably, litigated their issues in the local courts,
could then go to federal district court and file for a writ
of habeas corpus and have their federal constitutional questions
heard in an Article III court, so to the extent that this
statute is a restatement of a law as it stood in the District
of Columbia, it would be a statement of those principles.
Now, your Honor, the Solicitor General has argued
that Concrress was trying, when it passed the Court Reorganiza­
tion Act, to get the federal courts out of the business of
local law enforcement.
tion.

We have no quarrel with that proposi­

That clearly was the design so far as trials were

concerned on local charges,

under statutes that apply only

in the District of Columbia.
However, the Solicitor General then seeks to boot­
strap that argument into an argument that Congress also wished
to remove post-conviction attack entirely from the federal
district court here*
There Is no statement — and I would suggest to this
Court, no implication in the legislative history that Congress
went to that further step.

It is very nice to argue that it

may be in some philosophical way implied but I would argue
to the contrary, it is not implied.
To move trials to a new court system is one thing,
but to move the forum where one's federal constitutional rights
are heard is quite another thing.

There is nothing local about

the issue that Mr. Pressley seeks to raise.

There is nothing

local about one’s right to have a competent, a reasonably
competent attorney assist one at trial.

That is a federal

constitutional right and a right which applies nationwide.
QUESTION:

How does that relate to what kind of a

judge must hear him?
MR. FOSTER:
QUESTION:

Well, it —
Do you think that a superior court judge

is less competent to evaluate the effect of assistance of
counsel than a district judge?
MR. FOSTER:

No., your Honor, I don’t think we have

argued or need to argue that there is anything less legitimate#
as the Solicitor General characterizes it about the superior
court.

What we are saying is that it is different.

It is not

the same as a court where the judge of that court# his first
allegiance is to the United States Constitution and his
judgment is unimpaired# is protected by the fact that his
salary and his tenure in office are protected by the Consti­
tution.
There is a difference between that and a judge who
is appointed for a 15-year term# who may be removed at the
direction of a legislative foody which sits under the very
vaguest kind of guidelines# whose salary can be adjusted upwards
or downwards by the Congress and who# at the end of the 15
years# is subject to reevaluatior upon no standards at all.

This is the difference.
QUESTION:

Well,

now you are getting into equal

protection, which — do you accept the Solicitor General's
characterisation that you were deemphasizing your equal pro­
tection argument?
MR. FOSTER:

Well, the Solicitor General said I had

abandoned it and I don't accept that characterisation.
QUESTION:
MR. FOSTER:
your Honor.

He just said you deemphasized it, I think.
Well, I think it is clearly deemphasized,

It is in a footnote at this time and I suppose

that implies deemphasis but I think —
QUESTION:
MR. FOSTER:

I thought so.
Well, I think the reason that it is

there — in fact, I know the reason that it is there is
because it arises in the context — I am not arguing to this
Court the merits of the equal protection question or the
suspension clause question.

All I am saying to this Court is,

should this Court decide in the context of this statute
federal constitutional questions which are wide open as far
as this Court is concerned?
Now, is this the case 'which precipitates by force
this Court into an area of constitutional law where there are
very few guideposts of any kind whatsoever?

And the equal

protection argument is simply another example.

There is a

growing line of cases in the District of Columbia that talks

34
about this doctrine.
It has never been before this Court.

This Court

has denied certiorari several times and yet this Court will
have to decide that question and that is why it is in the form
that it is, not because I intend to abandon it, your Honor.
Now, the government -—
QUESTION:

As to the Solicitor General's point that

this Court had decided that an Article I Court can convict
you legally and constitutionally.
MR. FOSTER;

Well, I take respectful issue with the

Solicitor General because, in fact, I think Palmore is a case
on our side.

I think Palmore, to the extent that it decides

this question, tends to support our point of view, as did the
Court of Appeals.
What this Court said in Palmore was, that in the
context of the Court Reorganization Act, which created two
parallel court systems in the District of Columbia, it is
constitutional to try people in the Article I Courts and there
were many precedents for that, the courts-martial, the terri­
torial courts, the Indian tribal courts and so forth and so on..
It is quite different to say that, for the purposes
of post-conviction attack, you will be confined to one of those
two courts.
In fact, the Palmore opinion
out

is at pains to point

35
QUESTION:

My point was that a conviction in an

Article I Court is legal.
MR. FOSTER:
QUESTION:

No question.
That is what I asked you.

Did you agree

with that?
MR. FOSTER:

Yes.

Well, it is decided law, your

Honor, that an Article I Court is constitutionally competent
to try and convict someone of a felony created by the United
States.
QUESTION:

3ut it is not constitutionally sufficient

to hear a habeas.
MR. FOSTER:

I say it is not — it is not the same

thing for the purposes of the suspension clause as an Article
III Court.
QUESTION:
MR, FOSTER:

Why?
Because the gist of an Article III

Court — what distinguishes and Article III Court from all
other courts, that Is, state courts, military courts, whatever,
are the salary and tenure protections, two protections that
throughout our history have been thought to be absolutely
critical to the quality of the highest federal courts.
Now, the government wants to say to this Court —
QUESTION:

All the federal courts are

the lowest,

to which it would not apply but the set piece under Article III
of the Constitution, with federal —
QUESTION:

Would you include the courts of Massachu­

setts in that?
MR. FOSTER:

To me, the courts of Massachusetts are

non-Article III courts and therefore, the analysis is the same.
QUESTION;

Non Article III but they have the very

elements of tenure that you are talking about, comparable to
the federal.
MR. FOSTER:

Certainly, and I suppose that the people

of Massachusetts, in their vrisdorn, might amend their Consti­
tution and: remove those provisions but so long as the presump­
tion in our Federal Constitution is that these questions ought
to be presented to federal Article III judges —
QUESTION:

Well, you have lost me there.

Couldn’t

the people of this country amend the Constitution and give all
federal judges a fen-year term?
MR. FOSTER:

No question,but they haven’t done it.

What I am saying is, in the context of this case as it arises
in this Court, the linchpin of the orcranization and the way the
Constitution was put together and still stands is the idea that
federal judges are going to be these judges who had no local
bias, no local allegiance.
They were protected from the passions of the moment

37
and political

vogue by the salary and tenure protections.

That makes them different* in my view, from any other judge who
does not have those protections and this

Court has said

repeatedly that any substitute for federal habeas corpus must
be exactly commensurate.
Now, I am not here to say what is more legitimate or
less lecritimate, better or worse, I am simply here to say that
it is not exactly commensurate to say that the judge who will
hear your claim is different in quality.
Those qualities have been thought to be very
important.

In fact, this Court, in Palmore, said, "r'?e do not

deemphasize the importance of the distinction between Article
I and Article III, it is just that Article III is not required
here."
In my argument, let me be perfectly clear on the
federal constitutional point, my argument is not that Article
III requires that these federal constitutional questions be
heard in Article III court, it is that the suspension clause
requires that these questions be heard in -QUESTION:

Rut don’t you run into this problem, that

if the difference is great enough to make the Article I trial
an ineffective remedy, then you have statutory protection, by
the last clause in the statute which reads that, unless it also
appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective,
then you are not hurt, but if it is a lesser difference to that,

38
you then have to say it is a total suspension.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose that this Court could say

that that is what the last clause means and that the Article 1
court is ineffective and therefore, you come out at the same
point at the end of the argument.
I think that that argument suffers from the fact that
those words have been interpreted many times by this Court in
the 2255 context and it has been held not to mean that it is
the particular form.
For instance, in the 2255 context, if you are in the
circuit that does not hold your way, you can't say, oh, my
remedy is ineffective because if I could go back to my home
circuit, they would oive me a different result and so, though
I suppose it is open on arammar grounds to arrive at that
result, I am not anxious to press the argument, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Don't state court prisoners have the

federal habeas corpus available since 1789?
MR. FOSTER:
QUESTION:
MR. FOSTER:

No, your Honor, absolutely not.
When did they —
They acquired it after the Civil War

xn the acts passed in 1867 and in fact, the federal courts held
that there was no right before then but I am not saying —
QUESTION:

But your argument really doesn’t prove that

the Constitution was absolutely clear on this point.
MR. FOSTER:

Well, I think — let me back up a little

39
hit because I think I have not yet had an opportunity to say
that as ~ I do not say that, Mr. Pressley, the suspension
clause requires an Article IXI judge for Mr. Pressley because
he is like a state prisoner.

That is not my argument.

My

argument is that 2241 gives jurisdiction to the federal district
courts to grant writs of habeas corpus for people who are
confined by the authority of the United States and that power
has existed uninterrupted from the Federal Judiciary Act of
1789 — in fact, those words have stood unaltered over 200 years
of federal constitutional history and I think there is something
I am very frank to say to this Court that the question presented
by this case, the federal constitutional question presented by
this case has never been decided by this Court.
That is to say, whether or not the suspension clause
requires an Article XII court.
QUESTION:

Is another way of phrasing that to say,

was the writ of haveas corpus suspended during the first 80
years of this country's history?

Court which said federal habeas prior to the Civil War would
reach a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction of
the United States.
MR. FOSTER:
many such cases,

Yes, vouf Honor, there are, I think,

especially as to Article I courts, the

military courts, for instance, where frequently their judgments
were reversed upon review by — and they are, of course,
analogous because they are Article I courts like the superior
court in the District of Columbia.

That right, I think, has

existed from 1789 without any interruption and the government
has not cited any case or suggestion.

41
QUESTION:

They are not appointed for any time.

MR. FOSTER:

That is correct, your Honor, but they

are created under the same constitutional power that Congress
exercised.
QUESTION:

They don’t begin to get close.

MR. FOSTER:

Well, there are other examples, of

course, special courts that have been set up through our
history. Article I courts and in every case where an Article I
court or any non-Article III authority of the United States has
the power to lock people up, this Court and the other federal
courts have always foimd, without exception, that the writ of
federal habeas corpus would reach those people, every one of
them, and that is, of course, one of the

major differences

/

between this case and Palmore because this

Court in Falmore

was faced with many examples of people who could be tried and
convicted in non-Article III courts but in this case it is not
faced with an example of anyone who could be confined by the
power of the United States and could not ultimately go, after
exhaustion, to a Federal Article III court, now, for resolution
of his federal constitutional claims.

There is no such case.

Now, many times in our history, in our legislative
history, Congress has passed statutes which would appear to
reach the result and I, once again, am forced to disagree with
the Solicitor General.

In the Guzik case, this Court was faced

by a statute which says, "The judgments of courts-martial shall

42
be final,, binding and conclusive on all courts of the United
States." How much clearer could it be?
This Court said unanimously that language means that
you must exhaust your remedies in the Article I courts before
you present your question to the federal Article III courts.
It is the same question that is presented in this
case?

Does a statute — is this a finality statute or an

exhaustion statute is the other side of the same coin and I
would claim that the same considerations which moved the Court
to say, if we decide otherwise that this is not a finality
statute in Guzik, it is going to launch this into an area of
the Constitution that we have not yet adjudicated and it is
not necessary under the statute, though it was reasonably
clear.
There is no way to argue that final, binding and
conclusive could be any more clear.

Nevertheless, this Court

felt compelled to avoid the issue where i.t was fairly possible
to do so and that is my argument to the Court here today on
this statute.
Now, the government draws much solace from the fact
that the words are borrowed from 2255 and yet it must be clear
that they have a different purpose.
2255 was, in effect, a traffic rule that said, "We
are going to direct this litigation.

We are going to spread

it out over all the circuits because it is unfairly lumped up

No

that is why I was careful to say

that I am not arouincr that they created a 51st state.

They

said that for the purposes of how this will work out, it will
work out like the states do, as if this were a state, not that
it is the same and therefore, I would suggest that the place
to look for Congress' purpose in picking up this language from
2255 is to the statute which regulates these relations between
the states and the Federal Government and that statute is 2254
and what 2254 requires in this regard is exhaustion of nonArticle III remedies, state remedies in that case, before you
come into federal court for resolution of your federal consti­
tutional questions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Foster, is it any part of your argu­

ment that to construe the statute the way the government would
have us construe it would lead to a constitutionally inadequate
relief under 110(g) as compared with Article III, not only in
terms of the District of Columbia judges being Article I judges
with non-tenure and non-financial security, but in terms of the

possibly inadequate freedom of - District of Columbia judge to
consider a const!tutiona. claim compared to an Article III
judge, and

me give you a case to illustrate what my question

goes to.
Let's assume a conviction in. the superior court, an
appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on some
constitutional claim by the defendant and the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals rejects the claim and affirms the
conviction.
The defendant then comes into the superior court
under 110(g) making the same constitutional claim.

to reject

situation would be very different vis-a-vis a case that had
already been decided by the District of Columbia Court of

QUESTION:

Well, is the claim that Mr. Justice

Stewart has suggested that you urge as to the unconstifcutional-ity because of the inability of the superior court to

freely

voice its view at the local Court of Appeals as already spoken,
is that situation any different than the federal prisoner
earlier convicted in federal court, say, in the Fourth Circuit
in that he goes into the district court in Richmond and says
"I want federal habeas.

I was denied certain rights" and the

district court in Richmond says, "Well, I may think you were
fcut the Fourth Circuit considered these same claims on direct

48
appeal and turned them down,

That Article III judge isn't

free to rethink the thing,
MR, FOSTER:

I think, your Honor, he is in a

different situation under this Court's decisions dealing with
post-conviction attack than the superior court judge would be
and that is, this Court has emphasized that a federal judge,
in reviewing a federal constitutional question on post­
conviction attack, has a different job before him.

The

question is not guilt or innocence but the preservation of
certain federal constitutional values that are paramount and
the focus shifts slightly.
Nov?, I don't deny, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the
opinion of the

Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in your

example is of great weight but as I understand the situation
of a judge faced with that question, he is bound to determine
it again.
QUESTION:

MR. FOSTER:

Yes, your Honor, no question about that,

I am just saying that when the judge has before him a petition
for habeas corpus, his focus is slightly different than it
would foe if he were trying the case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Solicitor General, do you have anything further?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT IT. BORK, ESC MR. BORK:

Jxist a minor thina, Mr. Chief Justice.

If it were true that a prisoner had a right to qo
into a different court system because his own system has
already decided the issue and he has to qo someplace the
issue has not been decided, if that were a constitutional
principle, then 1 think it would follow, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that the federal prisoners here would have a riqht to qo
into the superior court system and the federal prisoners
around the country would find 2255 unconstitutional and they
would all have a right to qo in the state court systems so
that *■—

be.

QUESTION:

Or perhaps another circuit.

MR,, BORK:

Or another circuit, I think that might

Unless the Supreme Court here had spoken, Mr. Chief

Justice, in which case it would, again, be unconstitutional.
It has been rather clever, I think, argument about
the statute.

I think the constitutional issues must be

addressed because what has happened is, there’s a perfectly
plain statute that says this in words as plainly as can be
and we are told that the burden of proof is upon us to prove
that Congress really meant what it said.
I think the burden goes the other way.
Now, it turns out that Mr. Kliendienst, a couple
of pages before the language that was quoted, said that the

50
effort x*;as to transfer the entire criminal jurisdiction to
the superior court.
we could debate the ambiguities of Mr. Kleindienst' s
testimony but I think I would rather debate the clarity of
the statute.
One other point.

There was a suggestion that,

although Congress explicitly said e,We are using 2255 as a
model" and then did it, the appropriate place to look is
2254, which I think is argument of the same tenor, as the
constitutional interpretation here has been.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE RURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:07 o'clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
