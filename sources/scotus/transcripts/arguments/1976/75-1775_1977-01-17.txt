MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
next in Mo.

We will hear arguments

75-1775, Massachusetts against Jack B. Westcott.

Mr. whitehead, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD WHITEHEAD, ESO„
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WHITEHEAD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please

the Court:
Thi s case is? here on a writ of certiorari to the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

It involves a

criminal action brought by Massachusetts against Jack B.
T'7estcott for violation of Chapter 35 of the Acts and Resolves
of the General Court of Massachusetts for the Year 1923.
Chapter 35 makes it unlawful during the months of
July,? August and September for any person who has not been a
legal resideat of Massachusetts during the preceding year to
use beam or otter trawls to drag for fish in certain of the
waters of Vineyard Bound.
Vineyard Sound is a_ body of water lying between the
Island of Martha's Vineyard and the Elisabeth Islands off the
Coast of Massachusetts.
Th-i sole is:;sue before the Court today is whether
Chapter 35,

nsofar as it differentiates between residents and

nonresidents of Massachusetts, violates the privileges and

4
immunities clause contained in Article IV, Section 2 of the
Constitution.
The facts may be briefly stated.
Mr. Westcott is a resident of Rhode Island.

On

September 5th, 1973 he undertook to draa by means of an otter
trawl for scup and fluke, which are micrratory fish, in the
waters described by Chapter 35.
He was thereupon arrested by an officer of the
Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources and charged with
violating the statute.
On April 24th, 1974, he was tried and found guilty
of this violation by the District Court of Massachusetts.
Upon his conviction in the District Court, he pur­
sued his rights under*
the Superior Court.

Massachusetts lav? to de novo review in
However, in lieu of a trial in the

Superior Court, the parties

filed an agreed statement of facts,

, Nestcofct then presented a motion to dismiss the
action based upon two grounds.

First, that Chapter 35 violates

the privileges and immunities clause contained in Article iv,
Section 2 an3 second, that it violates the Equal Protection
Clause

of tie 14th Amendment.
Tin? Superior Court reserved decision on the motion

to dismiss aid reported the constitutional questions to the
Appeals Court of Massachusetts.

Shortly thereafter the

Supreme Judicial Court granted direct appellate review and on

March 12th, 1976, without ruling on the Equal Protection claim,
the Supreme Judicial Court

declared that Chapter 35 does

violate the privileaes and immunities clause and ordered that
the motion to dismiss be allowed.
It is our position that the Supreme Judicial Court
erred in finding Chapter 35 unconstitutional,
X would like to begin my argument by discussing the
relationship between the fisheries of Massachusetts and the
State,

I will then proceed to the constitutional doctrine by

which we believe this Court has given recognition to that kind
of interest.
The fisheries of Massachusetts are one of the most
important natural resources of the state.

In economic terms,

they provide the basis for one of the state's most significant
industries,
Equally as important as economics, though, they fur­
nish the basis for a unique way of life for many of the state’s
citizens.

That way of life is exemplified in such well-known

seaports as

Jantucket and New Bedford and gives the state a

quality distinct from that which other states have,
QUESTION:

Could you make the same statement about

a Rhode Island citizen?
:4R, WHITEHEAD:

What statement is that?

I3m sorry.

I don't understand the question,
QUESTION:

Well, that fishery is a unique and

6
important aspect of the economic life of the Commonwealth or
the state* et cetera* et cetera* efc cetera.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

I think it is more likely that the

fisheries of Rhode Island would be of greater interest to
Rhode Island residents than would be the fisheries of Massa­
chusetts although* of course, Mr. Westcott contends that he is
also interested in the fisheries of Massachusetts.
However, the fisheries of Massachusetts, I think,
account for a way of life in Massachusetts which is somewhat
unique from that of Rhode Island or New Hampshire or any of
the other coastal states.
They serve as a major reason why many people come to
live within Massachusetts and why many others who were born
there remain.

In short, they constitute a primary factor

underlying the state’s continuing vitality.
However,

lust as they are an important resource, the

fisheries of Massachusetts are a fragile one.

They are there­

fore worthy of special protection by the state.
It is our position that this Court has set forth a
framework which gives recognition to the unique interest which
a state nossasses in its natural resources.
In the past, it has used that framework to answer
challenges brought under the privileges and immunities clause.
Specifically, in cases such as McCready versus
Virginia, Hear versus Connecticut and Ratsone versus

7
Pennsylvania, the Court has ruled that the citizens of a state
possess in their collective capacity, a property interest in
the state’s resources.
The Court has further ruled that accordingly, the
right of those citizens to use the state's resources is not a
right derived from their citizenship per se but rather, a
right derived from their citizenship and their property com­
bined.
It is therefore, not a privilege or immunity of
citizenship guaranteed to the citizens of other states under
the privileges of immunities clause.
On only one occasion has the Court departed from this
analysis.

That was in Toomer versus witsell, decided in 1948.
In Toomer, the Court held that the right of the

citizens of South Carolina to take migratory shrimp from the
three-mile marginal belt located off of that stat e’s

•'*1 i n e

was not a property right but rather, was a privilege or
immunity of citizenship.
As such, it was not a right which was to be denied
to the citizens of the state,
Massachusetts concedes that if Toomer controls here,
Chapter 35 must be held unconstitutional.
However, we contoncl that Toomer no longer serves as
valid precedent.
Tha Court in Toomer declared that South Carolina

8

dici not possess an ownership interest in the shrimp for two
reasons.

First, it was the Court's view that

migatory

animals are, by their nature, inherently incapable of being
owned.
Second, a prior decision of the Court had held, that
the Federal Government possesses paramount control of the
resources of the marginal sea such that none of those resources
is susceptible of state ownership.
The second basis of the Court's decision in Toomer,
namely, that the resources of the three-mile belt are under
the paramount control of the Federal Government, has been
completely undermined by the passage of the Submerged Lands
Act in 1953.

By that legislation, Congress expressly conveyed

to the states, both title to and ownership in all the resources
of the marginal sea.
Accordingly, the states now possess the same

rights

of ownership in those resources as this Court had held them to
possess with respect to inland resources.
Thus, if Toomer is to control at all in this case,
it must be on the first ground articulated by the Court,
namely, that migratory animals are, by their nature, inherently
incapable of being owned.
rt ground finds no support in prior Supreme Court
adjudication.

This Court had never before held that a state’s

ownership in migratory animals differs from its ownership in

stationary animals.
Even more significantly, Congress, when it passed the
Submerged Lands Act, drew no such distinctions.

In its con­

veyance, it conveyed title and ownership to all the resources
of the marginal sea, specifically all fish.
We submit that the relative mobility of a given
species is an elusive concept.

That being true, the appropri­

ateness of a distinction based upon that concept is a matter
best left for Congressional analysis.
in this instance, Congress has determined that
mobility is lot the criterion upon which important rights
should turn and that being the case, this Court should respect
its -judgment.
We submit that the Court should now find that

migra­

tory fish located in the three-mile belt are, in fact, owned
by the respective states.
QUESTION:

And therefore?

HI. IIHITEHEADs

And therefore, the right to take

those fish is a property right and not a privilege or immunity
of citizenship.
QUESTION;

And that the taking of them may be

reserved for citizens of the state.
HR. WHITEHEAD;
QUESTION:

That is right.

So that that state could simply say

no

nonresidents may, or no noncitizens may fish in our waters.

10

MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct, under the privileges

and immunities clause.
QUESTION:

And when the fish swim out of Massachusetts

waters into Rhode Island waters, who owns them?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

Well, scup and fluke do not have that

kind of migratory characteristics.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose they had a migratory

characteristic.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

At that time ~~ at that point, when

the fish are in Rhode Island, it is Rhode Island that has the
special interest in those fish.
QUESTION:

I know.

MR. WHITEHEAD:

We are talking about ownership.

And the proprietary interest in those

fish.
QUESTION:

Oh, ownership shifts as the fish migrate

up and down the seaboard states.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That would be true of fish that

migrate up and down the coast.

However, we submit that our

case is —
QUESTION:

Well, Tooxwer seemed to think that that

ownership language was nothing but shorthand for regulatory
power, didn't it?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

But that statement in Tooir.er flies

directly in the face of several decisions decided by this
Court prior to that time, the most significant of which is

11
McCready versus Virginia,
QUESTION;

Well# what about a state whose law simply

says nonresidents# noncitizens may not own land in the state?
MR. WHITEHEAD:
public property.

All we are

talking about here is

If it bars noncitizens from acquiring private

property —
QUESTION;

Well# If the state put out the bids,

the foresting of the stater-owned forests.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

I think that is —

QUESTION:

And what about oil and gas on state-

owned lands?
MI- , WHITEHEAD:
respect to oil and gas.

It would be particularly true with

12
QUESTION;

And so that the leasing of oil in the

three-mile belt could be limited to citizens?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

But we are not

saying —
QUESTION:

Do you have some support for that?

MR. WHITEHEAD;

I think McCready versus Virginia is

the primary support.
QUESTION:

Anything else?

MR. WHITEHEAD:

Geer versus Connecticut which said

that the state owned wild birds in the state;

Patsone versus

Pennsylvania which said that the state —
QUESTION:

Well, it said it owned it so then, what

could they do about it?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

In Geer versus Connecticut, which

was the commerce clause case, they could prevent the killing
of game, cf those birds * for the purpose of taking them out of
state.

.
QUESTION:

tes

,

'• • •

everybody.

They could prevent any­

body from killing them for the purpose of taking them out of
state.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

In McCready versus

Virginia —
QUESTION:

But they didn't attempt to keep nonresi­

dents from killing them.
M; . WHITEHEAD:

No.

No, the statute prohibited

13

killing of game for the purposes of taking them out of state»
However, in McCreacly versus Virginia, Virginia
prohibited nonresidents from taking oysters within the state’s
waters.

The Court held that the state owned those oysters,

that the right of the citizens to take them was a property
right and not a privilege or immunity of citizenship.
QUESTION:

So you feel that ^ieCready and Toower are

reconcilable completely,
MR. WHITEHEAD:

I think, even at the time the cases

were decided, they were irreconcilable in this respect.

Toomer

found a distinction between migratory and stationary animals ■
which the NcCready Court did not find.

Although the animals

involved in HcCready were stationary, the Court there used
language which clearly indicated that the Court viewed that
free-swimming fish were also capable of ownership by the state.
Of course, they are not able to be reduced by
possession tut the ownership is similar to the ownership which
a person who holds private property has in the animals found
on that property.

He can exclude others from coming onto the

property to take the animals.
QUESTION:

Well, the state-owned parks may be

restricted to citizen users.
NR. WHITEHEAD:

You are talking about use in terms of

1ust going ci to the par.
that the law goes that far.

I am not sure that we are arguing

14
QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn’t you?

Why wouldn't

you, for Heaven’s sakes?
MR. WHITEREAD:

Because if does not impinge upon the

proprietary interest which the state holds in —QUESTION:

Well, it wears them out.

MR. WHITEHEADj
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

It wears them ouc.

The facilities on

them have to be replaced more often if they are used twice
as much.
MR. WHITEHEADs
there.

There is some difficult line-drawing

We would say —
QUESTION:

Well, what if the state couldn't do it?

What would you say the constitutional reason would be?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

If the state could not prohibit?

It

would have to come under the equal protection clause and the
privileges aid immunities clause.
QUESTION:

Why is that?

MR, WHITEHEAD:

Because the privileges and immunities

clause does lot protect proprietary rights, merely privileges
or immunities of citizenship.
The equal protection clause if? not concerned with
simply proprietary -- with privileges and immunities of
citizenship.

It extends to all kinds of rights.

We would therefore submit that neither of the premises
underlying Tooraer has current strength.

Accordingly, Toomer

15
itself should not be deemed controlling in this case
On the basis of its prior decisions, the Court should
rule that Chapter 35 is constitutional.
QUESTION:

Mr. Whitehead, could I just ask you a

question about your basic theory?

As I understand you, the

fish are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts before they
are reduced to possession and some individuals but not others
have the right to reduce them to possession.
MR, WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Which individuals may reduce fish to

possession?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

It would be the citizens of

Massachusetts.
QUESTION:
citizenship?

And what gives them that right?

Their

Is it a privilege of their citizenship that gives

them that right?
•iR. WHITEHEAD:

No, it is the fact that as citizens

and therefox a residents of Massachusetts, they —QU3STI0N:

Well, do they have to be resident citizens?

MR. WHITEHEAD:

Well, they wouldn't be citizens if

they weren't residents.
QUESTION:

Well, is that always true?

A citizen of

Massachusetts couldn't reside temporarily across the border?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

Oh, temporarily he could reside

across the border, but his legal residence would have to be in

16

Massachusetts.
QUESTION:

But it is the citizenship which gives him

the privilege of taking this fish for himself.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

Well, it is both his citizenship and

the fact that as a citizen, he possesses a property interest
along with all the other citizens in the resource.

I am

saying that —
QUESTION:

Yes, but say, one fish is swimming along.

He has only a very fractional interest in it and then if he
catches it he has got the whole fish.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:
that?

That is correct.

Now, what gives him the privilege to do

It is a privilege of his citizenship, I take it.
MR. WHITHHHAL .

There is one step in between.

As

a citizen, he is the owner of the fish and therefore
QUESTION:

He is the owner of a piece of the fish.

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

He is not the owner of the whole fish,

is he?
MR, WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:
whole fish?

That is correct.

But he -—

What gives him the right to take the

QUESTION:

You mean , the state couldn't open it up

to noncitizens?
MR, TfHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

It could open it up to noncitizens.

Well, it would be taking the citizens'

property«
MR. WHITEHEAD:

Rut the state has to exercise the

property right or holds the property right in trust for the
citizen.
QUESTION:

So it legislates and for whom does it

reserve the fishery?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

It reserves it for the benefit of

the citizens,
QUESTION:

And so it is, as Brother Stevens s&ys,

an incident to his citizenship.

Right under the statute it

is an incident to his citizenship.
Mi . WHITEHEAD:

Citizens because they are owners of

the property.
QUESTION:

Well, it is because they are under the —

the fishery is reserved to them by the statute.

That is the

class that is defined who are privileged to fish, citizens
and lienee it is a function of his citizenship.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

I think now, your Honor.

It is a

function of their property coincidental to those who have the
property interest.

They are also citizens.

Therefore, they

18

have the property.
QUESTION:

And yet the state could cyive it away.

MR. WHITEHEADs

It could give it away if it found if

was in the interest of those citizens in their collective
capacity to, in fact, give the fish away.
QUESTION:

But the citizen loses his interest once

the fish is out of the water.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

It is reduced to

private property in the collective ownership of the state.
My thesis is that at that point all the state has is a police
power over the fish.
QUESTION:

And he is free to take it out of the

state.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

In commerce.

MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

We are not saying

here that Massachusetts has attempted to restrict the use of
the resource once it has been taken to the borders of the
state but rather it has restricted to the resident the right
to take that resource in the first instance.
QUESTION:
fish is in t tiers.

You only get the property providing the
If the fish is over in Rhode Island, he is

not your property.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Bo he is only your property when he is

19
visiting you.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is a visiting property.

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

It could he characterized so.

Now you see it.

MR. WHITEHEAD:

Now you don't.

That is correct.

That principle

has its roots in the common law and the rights of a private
property owner to the animals found on his property.

It has

been called a qualified property interest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Whitehead, does your position

depend on the Submerged Lands Act?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

It does in part.

T*e need the

Submerged Lands Act to obviate one of the two grounds on
which Toomar was based.
QUESTION:

As I read Judge Reardon's dissent, he

relied almost exclusively on that.
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

He, as we, felt

that the fact that — aside from the fact that Congress had
conveyed the resources of the marginal sea to the states and
therefore obviated the marginal sea/tidewater distinction,
the fact that Congress had dravm no distinction between
migratory an i stationary animals was a strong indication that
no such distinction should, in fact, be drawn.
QUESTION:

But if that Act had not been passed, do

you still think Chapter 35 would be valid?

20

MR. WHITEHEAD:

Chapter 35 would be unconstitu­

tional, then, because the state -QUESTION:

How would you avoid Tcorner, then?

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

How would you aet around Toomer?

MR. WHITEHEAD:

We could not avoid Toomer in that

case because the state would have no proprietary interest in
the three-mile belt.
QUESTION:

So absent the federal act we would have

to overrule Toomer to support your position?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

I think absent the federal act we

would have not only to overrule Toomer, but the cases on
which Toomer was based, primarily United States versus
California, which was the initial case which held that the
states — that the Federal Government possesses paramount
control of the resources of the marginal sea.
You have to go one step back.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

In other words

The Submerged Lands Act did, in fact,

overrule United States against California so far as land
within a three-mile limit.
MRc WHITEHEAD:

I am not sure I would characterize

it as overruling U.Sversus Ca 1 ifornia.

Congress, in the

Submerged Lands Act, exercised the rightswhich the United

21
States -versus California had confirmed that it possessed.
QUESTION:

To alter the ownership relationship.

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:
Toomer said

That is correct.

Accordingly —

And of course, what did Toorrier say?

"No one owns the fish’5?

MR. WHITEHEAD:

Toomer criticized the ownership

theory hut in fact did not overrule HcCready versus Virginia,
which was the primary case articulating the ownership.
QUESTION:

And X donst suppose that the Congress

could grant something it didn’t have.
MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So you must say that Congress owned the

fish or that the United States owned the fish?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That is correct.

And there is

language in roomer which is inconsistent with that language
which says that migratory animals are inherently incapable
of being owned but I would assert that that language contra­
dicts earlier decisions of the Court and that fact, coupled
with the fact that Congress itself, after careful inquiry,
determined that there should be no distinction between
migratory and stationary animals.
QUESTION:

Co you think that Congress essentially

in the Submerged Lands Act was asserting its claim of owner­
ship that Toomer said it didn’t have?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That Toomer called into question

22
but McCready versus Virginia and other cases confirmed that
it did have.
QUESTION:

Older cases.

MR. WHITEHEAD:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do von think that Tooner would stand for

the proposition that neither the state nor the Federal Govern­
ment together possessed ownership?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

On the basis of the miaratory and

nonmioratory distinctions it, I suppose, could be argued that
the Federal Government could not possess ownership of the
migratory fish in
QUESTION:

the marginal sea.
Do you think if the Toomer Court would

have said that the Federal Government and the state govern­
ment had gotten together and banned foreign fishing within
the three-mile limit, that law would be bad?
MR. WHITEHEAD:

That kind of statute could be

enacted under powers,:apart from the riohts derived from
property it could be enacted by the states under the police
power or by Congress under a variety of powers, particularly
the commerce treatv clause, prooerty clause.
Accordincfly, because, we submit, Toomer is no
1 oncer a.

<

ocd law, we ask that Chapter 35 be held constitu­

tional and that the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court be
vacated and the case be remanded for further consideration
of the other claims raised by Mr. Westcott.

'23

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Whitehead.

Mr. Vetter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE M. VETTER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. VETTER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I represent Mr. Westcott in this case who, is, as
you already know, a Rhode Island fisherman fishinq out of
Point Judith.
The gist of my argument is that Toomer v. Witsell
is still good law, that the principles underlying Toomer and
Witsell are still valid principles, that to resurrect the
special public interest doctrine that my brother has argued
about would be a giant step backward and that the states can
achieve anything that they legitimately should be able to
»
achieve under the police power.
I should emphasize that the fish that we are
dealing with in this case are migratory fish.

That was

stipulated in the record below.
The privileges and immunities clause, the gist of

it is
it as we see it, is that/to bar a state from discriminating
against a citizen of another state solely or substantially
on the basis of noncitizenship.

It does not bar it absolutely

but when there is a discrimination, this Court has said that

the aliens or the noncitizens roust he the peculiar source of
the evil at which the statute is aimed and the purpose of
the privileges and immunities clause, I think, can be summed
up by saying that it is to protect, among other things,
common callings and in

one of the earlier cases, Ward versus

Maryland, this Court said that one of the purposes is to allow
a citizen of State A to do business in State B on substantially
the same grounds as a citizen of state B„
Now, as we see Massachusetts’ position here *—
QUESTION:

Mr. Vetter, do you think that includes

doing business with the property of the state?
Now, let’s just assume for the moment that a state
does nut out bids for timber cutting.

Bo you think it may

confine those invitations to state citizens?
MR. VETTER:

No, sir, I do not think they could.

And I think that —
QUESTION:
MR. VETTER:

So that is included in your statement?
Yes, it is.

As we view Massachusetts' position, they don't
really argue that the statute discriminates against noncitizenship .
QUESTION:

Mr. Vetter, can I go back to Mr. Justice

White’s question of a moment ago?

Didn't our Alexandria

Scrap decision last spring indicate that the State of Mary­
land was free in a purely proprietary capacity to favor

25
Maryland scrap over nonMaryland scrap people?
MR. VETTER;

Your Honor» I confess that I ant not

acquainted with that case hut I x^ould submit that the princi­
ples that we are dealing with here, the principle based on
property, it is not the basis for exercising a discrimination
The problem as we see it with the special public
interest doctrine is that at least all sorts of consequences
which I think, or we submit would be untoward consequences —
for example, in July of last year this Court decided Kleppe
versus Mew Mexico involving the ’"'Hid Free-Roaming Horses
and Burros Act.

That statute was passed by the government

to protect those animals on federal lands.
New Mexico then seized some of those animals.
Federal Government agency asked that they be returned.

The
The

State of New Mexico commenced an action in the Federal
District Court

and that Court held, on the basis of the

McCready case, that the federal statute was unconstitutional,
the special public interest doctrine.

They said that the

State of New Mexico had an ownership interest in these beasts
Well, the

Court reversed and in its reversal it

pointed out that the state has power over wild came and its
wild resources based upon the police power but that those

QUESTION:

But those burros were on federal land,

weren't they?
MR, VETTER:

Yes, sir, they were.

But the point

that I am making here is that — and while it may be deemed
dictum — the Court included within the litany of cases of
paramount federal powers, Toomer v. Witsell, which is the
key case which we are dealing with on this argument today.
In Toomer v. Wltsell, it dealt with the privileges
and immunities clause and did not deal with federal lands.
It did not deal with the property clause of the United. States
Constitution,
Xr other words, we cite that in our brief as
indicative that Toomer y, uitseil is still an alive and vital

The suit against Holland involved the

MR. VETTETV

Yes, it did.

QUESTION:

As I remember.

QUESTION:

You can take. Toomer out of TCleppe and it

would not affect it at all.
MR. VETTER::

Yes, sir, I admit that it was dictum.

27
But nonetheless it was included within the thinking
of this Court, we submit, as an example of the paramount
federal power to which the state must exercise its power.
In any event, as we see Massachusetts' position,
they don’t point to aliens as a particular source of evil and
frankly, as we see it, they don’t even try to justify the
statute as a conservation statute and as you have heard in
their argument, they merely say that the statute — they, in
effect, say that the clause is inapplicable because of the
special interest doctrine of McReady versus Virginia, as we
see the structure of their argument.
New, that doctrine,, as my brother pointed out,
bases — that doctrine states that the citizens own the wild­
life of the state in common, that the state government
exercises chat ownership as sort of a truss tee and that the
state government in the exercise of that ownership can
discriminate against noncitizens, mainly those who do not
have that beneficial interest.
Ard then it goes on to say that the right to hunt
and fish of s state citizen derives from ownership and not
citizenship and so, consequently, that is not a privilege
of citizenship guaranteed to citizens of other states.
I Jalieve, Mr. Justice White, you were getting at a
point which seems germane to me and that is that in the
McCreadv case, the Court points out

that the ownership

28
derives, really, from two sources»

It derives from the

citizenship of the state as a state citizen and it gets its
ownership by virtue of being a citizen so, consequently, I
would be so bold as to say that there may be a fallacy in
the McCready reading because if that is true, obviously,
then, the privileges and immunities clause would apply even
in the McCready situation.
4.

The problem, of course, with relying on the McCready
case is that Toomer v. Witsell stands in the way like a huge
roadblock.
Now, I think it is important to know the factual
situation which confronted the Court when that case was
decided.
The shrimp fishery, which was off the southern
coast, was not a shrimp fishery that was restricted within the
territorial waters of any state.

It was a giant fish

shrimpery and the shrimp would migrate south and the commer­
cial shrimp fishermen would start up at the northern part of
their shrimp fishery and follow them right down to Florida.
South Carolina passed a statute which restricted
fishing to residents of South Carolina within the territorial
seas of South Carolina.
The consequence was that you had the shrimp fishery
partitioned along these state lines and what, in effect, you
had, as I describe in our brief, is a feudal situation and so

29

that was the situation that the Court faced.
Now, the Court was well-aware of the McCready case,
of course, because South Carolina relied upon it exclusively
and the Court characterised the McCready case as the sole
case using the Special Public Interest Doctrine to justify
discrimination against commercial hunting and fishing by non­
citizens absent persuasive independent reasons to support
that discriminatione
It then distinguished McCready on the two grounds
already mentioned? McCready dealt with stationary fish in
tidal waters and Toomer dealt with migratory fish in the
marginal sea.

It characterized McCready as the sole exception

to the general rule and Toomer as a case that did not on its
facts fall within that exception.
^nd then it said that the very facts distinguishing
Toomer made the McCready case a very weak prop for South
Carolina to rely upon because —- and then it nets to the
crucial point that it is very doubtful whether migratory fish
can be owned, citing the illustrious case of Missouri v.
Holland, where the Court said, that was the treaty case
involving the migratory birds, "To put the claim of the state
upon title is to lean, upon a slender reed.

Wild birds are

not in the possession of anyone? and possession is the be­
ginning of ownership."
Ar.l so consequently, on that basis and also on the

30

basis that the state did not own the three-mile belt, although
the Court recognized that it could regulate within the threemile belt, the Court said that the McCready case did not
apply and then it came to some other

very seminal language

which I should like to quote:
They said, the Court said, "The whole ownership
theory in fact is now generally regarded as but a fiction
expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people
that a state have power to preserve and regulate the exploita­
tion of an important resource"and there was no necessary
conflict between that vital policy consideration and the
constitutional command that the state exercise that power,
like its other powers, so as not to discriminate without
reason against citizens of other states.

And that conse­

quently —
QUESTION:

Mr, Vetter, would your analysis carry

over to wild animals on land?
MR, VETTER:

Yes, sir, I believe it would and as a

matter of fact, there are a number of state cases which are
cited in our brief where state courts have adopted that
analysis.
In a nutshell, nowadays, the modern management tool
is the police power.

The states can do everything that they

need to control their resources under the police power and the
police power is exercised, consonant with --

31
QUESTION:

Well, but the police power is subject to

the privileges and immunities clause, too.
MR. VETTER:

Yes, so it is and that is the very

point, that —
QUESTION:

Well, so how does the modern management

tool of the police power solve any of the problems that the
states see as confronting them?
MR. VETTER:

The police power, your Honor, gives the

state — as we submit -- all the power it needs to conserve
its natural resources.

However, the police power is obviously

subject to the equal protection clause and the privileges and
immunities clause and our position is that they can only
conserve their resources consummate with the commands of
those clauses.
In other words, they cannot invidiously discrim­
inate against those citizens of other states, resident aliens
or whathaveyou.
QUESTION:

What if a state wants a $500 license

from a nonresident to hunt antelope and a $10 license from
residents to hunt antelope?

Any constitutional objection

to that?
MR. VETTER:

Yes, there would be.

I think that

that statute would be unconstitutional or, put it this way?
I think the Court

wqiId

subject that statute to close scru­

tiny unless it could be shown that there is some justification

32
for the added expense,,

It might be much more expensive, for

example, to monitor or to police out-stats residents from
hunting and that point is made clear in the Toomer case, that
it doesn’t absolutely bar discrimination.
For example, the Toomer case — the Court in the
Toomer case explicitly said, "It is possible, for example,
that

if South

Carolina could show that it was more expen­

sive to watch over the fishing boats of nonresidents, that
they could have a higher fee for nonresidents.
QUESTION:

That puts

it just on the reasoning,

then, of the inspection fee cases, that you can charge if it
costs more.
Ml. VETTER:

Essentially, that is the type of

reasoning that I think underlies the discrimination which
would be allowable in this area.
QUESTION:

Well, what if

the State of Massachusetts

determined that it could only issue 50 fishing licenses for
this particular kind of fish because there just were not
many running and only 50 fishermen had much of a chance of
catching tnem.

Now, do you think it could reserve, say, 40

of those for residents of Massachusetts?
MR. VETTER:

I would submit not.

I would submit

ir would have to do it on a lottery basis or some such basis
wherrby res; .lents of Rhode Island and New Hampshire, which
are discontiguous states, would have —

/

33

QUESTION:

Well, and presumably under your theory

residents of Oregon or Nevada
MR. VETTER:
sir.

or Minnesota, too»

I would think that they could, yes,

I think that is the purport of the privileges and

immunities clause.
QUESTION:

And so if all 50 licenses ended up in

the hands of nonresidents, there is nothing Massachusetts
can do about it.
MR. VETTER:

I think the logic of my position

carries me that far.

But I think what the point of the

matter is, though, is that we may he mixing apples and
oranges again because T think it is fair to say — or at
least I think it is fair to say that this is not a conserva­
tion statute.

It is a statute which is really designed to

monopolize that resource for Massachusetts residents and I
am not so sure that they can do that under the Constitution.
jUESTION:

As a matter of fact, you are sure they

cannot,
MR. VETTER:

I am sure that they cannot.

That is

right, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Does your case turn primarily on the

fact that you were dealing with migratory fish?

Suppose you

had fish in an inland pond, say, bass or trout and that they
exacted a much higher license fee for nonresidents to fish
in the lakes or ponds.

That would be a conservation move,

34

perhaps»

How would you view that?
MR, VETTER:

It is a much more difficult case.

X

can say that the states -— the sshake1 case which is cited
in my brief —it is a state court case out of Oregon — out
of Wyoming ■— adopted the reasoning that I am adopting here,
that they cannot invidiously discriminate and I think that
the loqic of my rensoninq takes me to say that they would
not be able to discriminate aaainst nonresidents unless there
was some reason for the discrimination.
In other words, they could not merely say that
nonresidents couldn't come in or said somethinq -- set a
prohibitory license fee merely on the basis of nonresidancy
o:r lack of state citizenship.
QUESTION: But you are not limiting this concept to
the miqratory propensities of wildlife, are you?
MR. VETTER:
QUESTION:

I am not limiting my —
In other words, in a state like Minne­

sota or Wisconsin, you have nothing

practically nothing
They don’t migrate any­

where, but they charge a great deal more for an out-of-state
license.
You say as long as that license is not so great a
disparity as to he obviously discriminatory or penalizing in
its nature that that is all right to have a difference.
MR. VETTER:

Yes, sir.

35
QUESTION:

I misunderstood you.

I thought you said

that a differential in, we'll call it the price of a license,
could be constitutionally justified only if you could show
that it would cost that much more to administer and to
enforce the licensing.
MR. VETTER:

I used that as an example of the type

of discrimination which would be allowable because it seems
if you don’t have some sort of independent reason such as
that, as the Tooner case says, you are thrown automatically
back on the fact of the discrimination hinging entirely on
nonci.tizenship which I believe, not only Tooner v. Witsell
but any number of other cases said,is not supported by the
Constitution.
QUESTION:

Mr, Vetter, suppose we have a big lake in

Massachusetts with a whole lot of bass, as my brother Powell
was talking about and the state says, "We are going to get out
of the bass business

and therefore, all of the citizens of

the state can go and take all of those fish they want, but
no nonresidents."

Is that all right?

MR. VETTER:
QUESTION:

I think that ~
Because I warn you, if you don't agree

that is all right, then if the state says, "I am going to
give all of my citizens a hundred bucks," then all the
foreigners could come in and get a hundred bucks and you are
not going that far.

36

MR. VETTER:

That is the — I think it is fair to

say that there is a certain area*, a grey area that you like
to call it.

Part of the —- certainly the thinkincr of Toomer

v. Witsell and Missouri v. Holland and McKee v. Grata and so
on and so forth, these other cases, is that you can’t own
something which is migratory and flying or swimming in the
marginal sea.
Now, I think it is possible •— I think it is
possible that a court could, if it wanted to, drawn a dis­
tinction because you really don’t face the same sort of
overriding problems with bass in an inland lake as you do
with commercial fisheries in the marginal sea.

I think there

would be inconsistencies, though, because that would have to
be pitched — well, let ma put it this way.

I think that if

that were pitched, if that were pitched on a property right
such as Massachusetts argues for in this case, I think it
would ba difficult to justify it.
I think if it were pitched on the police power or
some other power and there were adequate grounds for the
discrimination, I think it would be all right.

Well, what is so magic about calling

something a police power?

A state, in the exercise of any

of its powers, is limited by the Federal Constitution.
MR. VETTER:

Yes, sir.
And it. does not change the matter to

call it the state's police power.
HR. VETTER:

No,

I don't.

I think the reason, as

I see the reason for it, is simply this, that when you put ir
on a property right, you have, bringing with it all sorts of
old running through the centuries of the common law -QUESTION:

An absolute right to deal with it as

well.
HR. VETTER:

It is an absolutist point of view and

I think the HcCready case in the argument of my brother here
is an indication of where that leads you and that is one of
the points that I should like to make here and that is that
we don't really contend

obviously we don't contend that

38

the state should not have power to regulate its fish and
game*

We do»
QUESTION;

You do concede its power»

MR. VETTER;

We do concede that power.

But that

power has to be exercised in an evenhanded manner and the
problem is that when you pitch that power on an ownership,
you end up wdth the problems that we have here today because
of the type of thinking, the absolutist^ type of thinking
that the old land law carries with it.
QUESTION;

On the other hand, the problem with your

submission is, how evenhanded must it be?

Your submission

leads logically to the conclusion, I suppose, that a state
simply could not charge a differential in price between a
resident and a nonresident fishing license, for example, in
its inland waters unless it could show that it cost, somehow,
more to enforce its fish laws against nonresidents than it
does against residents.
MR. VETTER;

Well, the answer to that is yes but I

want to go on to say one other thing and that is that there
1

can be other bases for the discrimination because -—

QUESTION:

That might be the case, from what I

have heard, with respect to pheasants in — where it. it,
the Dakotas?

I am not a pheasant hunter but I understand

there are only two or three states in the Union that have an
abundance of pheasants and that nonresidents are charged
very substantial fees, otherwise, there would be tens of
thousands of people in there and shoot the pheasants out.
MR. VETTER:

That is the type of thinking which I

think I would permit or sustain the discrimination.
QUESTION:

Mr. Vetter, did I understand you to

draw a distinction between possibly inland lakes a little
while ago?

I take it you would make the same argument with

respect to boundary river waters and certainly the Great
Lakes, would you not?
MR. VETTER;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, 1 would.
Sometimes the East Coast forgets those

things.
MR. VETTER:

I think it would be the same argument.

There is one point which I would just like to touch
upon and that is the effect of the Submerged Lands Act.

Our

40

view of that Act is that it merely confirms in the states
whatever rights the states had before and this, essentially,
was a management power and that in any event, if migratory
fish, wild animals cannot be owned, the Federal Government
by an act, could not say or give title to those animals and
so, consequently, we don’t think that the Submerged Lands
Act has any bearing whatsoever on Toomer v, Witssll and so
that the language in the Submerged Lands Act, referring to
ownership of fish, is really, again, the language of Toomer
v. Hit sellIt is a legal shorthand for the power to manage.
QUESTION:

Well, except the Toomer opinion •— and

correct me if I am mistaken — did rely on the California
case, didn't it?
MR. VETTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it did.
And the California case was turned around

130 degrees by the Submerged Lands Act.

And to that extent,

one of the foundations for the .Toomer opinion was removed.
Isn't that right?
MR. VETTER:

This Court in the Maine case, a

recent decision cited in my brief, points out that the
Submerged Lands Act did not overrule the California case.
QUESTION:
MRv VETTER:
QUESTION:

No, but it did turn it around.
It diet turn it around, yes, sir.
And what was held in the California

case to belong to the Federal Government under the Submerged

•41

Lands Act now belongs to the states, i.e., the three-mile
belt.
MR, VETTER:

At the very most, it would cut out

that one segment of Toomer, the three-mile belt ownership.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. VETTER:

It would not cut out the other argu­

ment, that you can't own wild birds and fish.
One further point on that.

In the addendum to our

brief we cite certain legislative history to indicate that
Congress was well-aware of Toomer v. wit.sell when it passed
the Submerged Lands Act and as a matter of fact, said an
amendment which would be the gist of the argument that we are
making now was entirely superfluous in light of that Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Vetter, do you rely at all on the

distinction between two kinds of ownership that are discussed
in the Toomer case?
dominium

There is a footnote on the case between

and imperium.
MR. VETTER:

Do you rely on that at all?
I cite it in my brief and it seems to

me what 'was meant by that, by that footnote, was very simply
that very early in the game there was a confusion and the
gist of the footnote is that way back in the old days, Roman
days, perhaps, control of wild game was based upon imperium,
which was state power, rather than dominium, which is owner­
ship and to that extent I would certainly say that we do
roly on it because if it is imperium, I think it goes into

42
the police power and not

into the ownership concept and that

is, really, what I ha\?e been arguing this morning ■— or this
afternoon.
QUESTION;

I suppose one might argue that if that

footnote is read to mean that ownership in the McCready case
is in the imperium or regulatory sense, one could also con­
strue ownership in the statute changing the California
result in the same sense,
MR. VETTER:
QUESTION:
MR. VETTER:

Yes, sir.
That you have.
Finally,, on policy grounds, to

reinstate Me-Sready, we submit would reinstate the feudal
situation that we have in the marginal sea or they had in the
marginal sea in that case.
Migratory fish don't know any boundaries.

It

would be difficult for commercial fishermen to carry on their
calling if all of a sudden they had to stop ana turn away
when they were dragging for fish because they were reaching
a boundary.
States with

small boundaries like New Hampshire,

for example, up where I live, would have a very limited area
in which to fish because they just obviously would not own
as much of the marginal sea.
The special public interest doctrine would also be
a step backwards because it would lead to such situations as

43
we had in the Kleppe case which I talked about earlier and,
quite frankly, it seems to me that this document Massachusetts!
would argue for cou2,d really lead to the depletion of
natural resources because what is really to say that a state
is necessarily going to conserve its resources.

And certainly, as we see, a lot of our problems in
the marginal sea and out to the 200-mile limit right iw*,
are

beginning to realise there has to be a broader control.
If, within the three-mile limit the states held

fesse exclusive powers, we really canBt say what might happen.
And so in conclusion, we submit that the Court
should affirm the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
