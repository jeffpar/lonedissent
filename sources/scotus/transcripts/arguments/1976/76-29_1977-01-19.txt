MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN W. PERRY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. PERRY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

this Courts
This case is her© on appeal from, a decision of the
Supreme Court of Mississippi upholding the validity of a
State tax levied on interstate commerce, on the privilege of
engaging in interstate commarce.
I represent Complete Auto, the appellant, which is
seeking to recover these taxes from the State of Mississippi.
The State, of course, is a part of this action through
Charles R. Brady, the Chairman of the State Tax Commission.
Complete Auto is a Michigan corporation engaged in
transporting new motor vehicles, cars and trucks, from the
manufacturer to the dealers in 48 States? operates pursuant
to authority granted foy 'the Interstate Commerce Commission.
It doesn't have any intrastate operating rights from the
Mississippi Public Service Commission.

It’s been engaged in

-this business in Mississippi since 1940, and engaged in the
business of transporting- vehicles from the Jackson, Mississippi,
railhead around sine® approximately 1960.

4
During that period of time it has paid substantial
income tares , franchise taxes , ad valorem taxes and license
plate fees ,
Since the Tax Commission’s main contention is that
this activity of

Complete Auto constituted intrastate

commerce, a brief reference to the undisputed facts concerning
th© activities of Complete Auto in Mississippi is necessary.
Complete Auto is engaged only in the business of
transporting new motor vehicles fox' General Motors,

Ail of

th© motor vehicles that were transported by Complete Auto
were manufactured in plants outside the State of Mississippi.
General Motors, pursuant to its obligations to its
dealers, was responsible for delivering the motor vehicles to
th© dealer’s location.

General Motors chose the carrier ox*

carriers to make -that delivery.

Of course, it was necessary

that th© delivering or final carrier be a motor carrier,
since most dealer's showrooms are not located adjacent to
railroad terminal facilities.

In many cases, Complete Auto

or another motor carrier will transport the vehicles toe
entire distance from the manufacturing plant to to© dealer.
In some cases, however, as in the activities with
which we are particularly concerned, General Motors found it
more economical to use a rail carrier for a portion of the
journey and a motor carrier, such as Complete Auto, to
complete th© delivery to the dealer.

5
General Motors made all the transportation arrange­
ments before the vehicles left the plant* at the time each
vehicle left 'the plant* a label was placed in or on the motor
vehicle showing the particular dealer to whom it was to be
delivered.
The trial court found* as a matter of fact* that
once the vehicles were delivered to the carrier* that
General Motors had nothing whatsoever to do with the trans­
portation* and the vehicles were in the custody* car© mid
control of the carriers from the time they left the manufactur­
ing plan to the time they left 'the — until the time they
arrived at the dealer-.
And the transportation here at issue* a railroad
transported the vehicles from the manufacturing plant to a
rail ramp in Jackson* Mississippi; in Jackson* the railway
transferred the vehicles to Complete 1 Auto* which completed
the transportation to the dealer.

Some of the dealers were

located in the State of Mississippi* some of the dealers
were located outside of the State of Mississippi.
At the trial of this case* and in fch© Appendix are
documents illustrative of the type of transactions we're
talking about* they show that* for the documents which are
in evidence* the vehicles were shipped from a manufacturing
plant in Atlanta* Georgia* by the Southern Railway System,
to Meridian* Mississippi* which is in the ©astern portion of

6

the State* and there they were transferred to the Illinois
Central Railroad* which carried the vehicles to Jackson*
which transferred the vehicles to Complete Auto for continua”
tion to the dealer in the State and out of the State»
Th© statute at issue in this case provides* in part*
as follows s
“There is hereby levied and assessed* and shall fa©
collected* privilege taxes for the privilege of engaging or
continuing in business or doing busines.3” * and then it
describes the tax to ba

levied pursuant to certain, following

sections *
The particular section with «which w© are concerned
provides* in part* that:
"Upon every person operating a pipeline* airline*
bus, truck* or other transportation business for the
transportation of persons or property for compensation or
hire between points within the State* there is hereby levied*
assessed* and shall be collected* a tax equal to five percent
of the gross income of such business."
Acting pursuant to these statutes* the Tax Commission
assessed a tax against Complete Auto on the gross receipts
derived by Complet® Auto for transporting the vehicles from
Jackson. Mississippi* to the dealers in Mississippi»

The

State Tax Commission did not assess any tax on any portion
of the gross receipts earned by Complete Auto in transporting

7
fch® vehicles from Jackson; Mississippi, to dealers in other
Statese
The Commission’s position in levying this tax has
always been that it considers Complete Auto's activities, in
continuing this interstate transportation from the manufacturer
to the dealers, to be intrastate commerce.

It's our position,

however, that the interstate character of the transaction is
clearly demonstrated by fch® undisputed facts0

It's

undisputed —»
QUESTIONS
MR. PERRYs

Mr. Perry, ~
Yes, sir?

jr

QUESTIONS

how long has Mississippi had this

statute in its present form?
MR. PERRY; The. statuta was amended to its present
form in about 1955, as I recall, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

It

had a predecessor statute which was in effect, at least in
IS49, when this Court decided the Interstate Oil Pipeline case.
That tax statute was vary, similar to the one now in effect.
QUESTION; Did they all speak in terms of privilege?
MR.PERRYs

Yes, sir. The statute prior to 1955

said "privilege" once? this statute says "privilege" twice.
It's undisputed that the intention of General
was
Motors/ that the motor vehicles be transported from the
manufacturing piant to the dealer? it's undisputed 'that; the.
only break in fch® transportation was for tee purpose of trams-

3
ferring the vehicles from one carrier fco another? it’s
undisputed that after that transfer took place the transporta­
tion to the dealer continued? and it!s undisputed that General
Motors had nothing whatsoever to do with the vehicles after
they left its plant*
The Commission's position in this seems to be based
solely on its contention that it believes the form of the
documents establish that-this is somehow intrastate commerce„
And the Commission's brief even asserts that this fact is
controlling» and the form of the documents is the only partiri"
©nt fact that this Court needs to consider
It's undisputed that separate bills of lading or
way bills were prepared for the railway journey and for the
truck journey*

There were separate bills of lading*

However» it's also undisputed that the reason for
that was that the joint tariffs had not been filed for the
rail carrier» for the truck carrier*

Since there were no

joint tariffs for 'these two carriers» there could be no
joint rates? thus» there could ba no joint documenta*
We have cited numerous cases in oxir brief holding
that the form of the bill of lading or the documents is not
controlling» doesn't affect the character or continuity of
an interstate movement.
W© have also cited numerous cases showing that a
mere interchange from on© carrier to another doesn't affect an

9

interstate movement.
And -the lack of merit in the Commission's contention*
that this Court need look only to the bills of lading* is
clearly evident from the peculiar and inconsistent results
which it produces.
QUESTIONS

Well* is your client -- is there an

income tax in this suit? ■
MR. PERRYs

Yes* sir.

And the record* at Exhibit

C-5* shows that Complete Auto — which is cited, in the brief
— shows that Complete Auto paid that tax* the corporate
franchise tax* ad valorem taxes* and license plat® fees to the
State.
QUESTION:

And why are those taxes permissible?
\

MR. PERRY:
see it* Your Honor.

They are not "privilege54 taxes* as we
We don’t contend that those are

privilege taxas by «—
QUESTION:

Well* if Mississippi just changed its

label here and said* We are now putting a tax on transporta­
tion?
MR. PERRY:

Well* that’s somewhat akin to th® Raiiway

Express case* where* if they merely — in Railway Express* you
remember* there was an earlier decision where this Court
invalidated a Virginia statute* and a few years later* after
the Virginia Legislature had revised the statute* the
question came up as to whether the amended statute still

10
levied a privilege tax.

And the Court held, in a decision as

to which there were some reservations in dissents* that* yes*
that was indeed a property tax* or a tax levied in lieu of a
property tax* and -therefore it wasn’t a privilege tax.

The

question wasn’t exactly free from doubt* as I recall* Hr.
Justice Brennan expressed some reservations* and Mr» Justice
Stewart dissented.
I am not sure that merely excising the word*
88 privi lege" from this tax would make it not a privilege tax.
I think that you still have to look and see if the State is
contending that it’s not levied on the privilege of engaging
in business* exactly what incident is it levied on.
QUESTION:

'Jell* what’s the vice of a privilege

tax as opposed to* say* a gross income tax on income derived
from transportation within the State of Mississippi?
MR. PERRY; Well* of course* there is the basic
argument that the State does not have the power to exclude
a. company from engaging exclusively in the interstate commerce.
That’s perhaps a formal argument.
The particular practical problems that such a tax
creates is that a privilege tax is more selective than the
other taxes* which this Court has held* such as an income
tax or property base.

QUESTION; What if this tax were exactly — had
exactly the same incidents* except it was called a gross income

11

tax on income derived from transporting property within the
State of Mississippi?
MR. PERRYs

This Court has chosen, 1 think, to draw

a bright-*line feast because of the dangers that a privilege
tax necessarily has.
QUESTION:

It leads to discrimination?

MR. PERRYs

Yes, sir. The danger of a selective

If it's on the privilege of doing inter­

QUESTION:
MR. PERRYs

interstate commerce„

No, sir, -there could be a —Well, I mean, if —
•— tax that was applied to —■ excuse me,

sir.
QUESTION: Well, if the tax, if that's what the tax
law says, why, by definition, it would reach only interstato
commerce.
MR. PERRYs

I’m afraid I don't understand your

question, sir.
QUESTION: Well, if the lav/ said that we put a tax
on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce?
MR. PERRYs

Yes, sir.

Surely, that’s prohibited.»

but the Spector decision, on which our argument is based,
goes a lot further than that.

In that case it was held that a

tax placed on interstate arid, intrastate commerce„ in the form

12
of a privilege tax., was invalid.

It's not just a tax that is

levied on interstate commerce that's invalid, it's one that
is levied on interstate and intrastate commerce, if it is in
fact levied on the privilege of engaging in interstate
commerce„
QUESTION: Well, do I understand you, then, to say
that if Mississippi changed its label, but imposed the same
tax, it would be all right?
MR, PERRY:

No, sir,

Express case again, Your KOnor,

I think that's the Railway
In that case the tax was

reconstructed as a property tax by making it in lieu of the
property tax on certain intangible assets of the carrier,
I think that if the State of Mississippi were to enact the
same statute merely excising the word "privilege", one would
have to look at what, in fact was being taxed by this statute,
looking afc the entire structure of the Mississippi taxing
system to see if they had in fact found a valid taxable
incident upon which they had levied the tax.

They could

demonstrate ~~ excuse me?
QUESTION:

I have one last question, you said this

Court has maria a bright line, do you really mean that?
MR, PERRY:

Yes, sir, I think Spector is a pretty

bright line —
QUESTION: What about Memphis Gas?
MR. PERRY:

Of course that predated Spector, and

13

Memphis Natural Gas was, of course, a franchise tax, and after
Colonial Pipeline, those two cases are really — the corporate
franchise incident is a separable incident, as I read the
Court’s opinion in Colonial Pipeline.
QUESTION: Then you are saying label is important?
MRo PERRY:

No, sir,

I think that the ~ well, the

label is important in that it helps us prove in this case that
it's

not levied on anything except the privilege,,

If the

State merely took out the word "privilege", I think we would
have a harder time, but we could still succeed if we
established that it was not levied on anything but the
privilege,
QUESTION: So, in your mind, then, Memphis Gan end
Spector are entirely reconcilable?
MR. PERRY: Well, I’m not going to represent to the
Court that I can reconcile every word in both opinions.
QUESTION: Well, you said it was a bright lin«„
MR. PERRY:

Yes, sir.

I believe that, to the

extent that Memphis Gas is inconsistent with Spector, I believe
Spector controls•

And I believe that the cases sine© Spector

are certainly consistent with Spector.

I think that there

are a number of cases in the Thirties and Forties where the
Court was struggling with just this question, whether to
adopt a test of balancing the burden on interstate commerce
against the State's need for revenues, and 'the benefits

14
provided to the State, a case-by-case adjudication of the
validity of each tax»

On the other hand, there were those on

the Court who believed that the appropriate test would be a
bright-line test, condemning either privilege taxes or
sometimes expressed as a direct tax» And I don't sea that
language in Spector»

I think it is not a privilege tax»

The Court wrestled with that problem apparently for
a number of years, and came down on the bright-line test,
perhaps in the interest of affording certainty to th© taxpayer,
perhaps in recognition that ‘th© difficulty of a taxpayer
proving that a particular tax burden on interstate commerce
is almost insurmountable»
QUESTIO?! * But, if you were to prevail, I suppose
your Legislature could do what the Louisiana Legislature did
in Colonial Pipeline and set up alternative incidents, as
they did there, and then go on and tax you?
MR» PERRY*

They could not choose the valid incident

which the Louisiana Legislature used, and which this Court
sustained, which was the corporat©' —
QUESTIO?!s
they?

But those were alternatives, weren't

Three of them»
MR» PERRY *

Yes, sir»

I don't read Colonial Pipeline

as justifying all three, but merely the privilege of doing
business in corporate form»

The State of Mississippi has a

corporate franchise tax which is levied on that incident, and

15
I'm not sure that they could tax it again* without it really
being a privilege tax»
QUESTION? Sometimes the Court has at least had
discussion* if not inquiry into what it is that the taxpayer
is getting for the money he is paying out»
Is it your position that, the taxes you are already
paying* the various taxes you mentioned* balance out all that
you are getting and that you get nothing for this tax?
MR„ PERRYs

It's the difficulty that answering that

question present® that I believe justifies the bright-line
rule» We pay substantial taxes0

I'm not sure that anyone can

quantify or that a court can. quantify the cost to the State,
of providing the benefits* or the value of the benefits which
that taxpayer receives*

And w© have not tried to* in this

case* argue that we only received X amount of benefits* but w©
pay Y amount of dollars*
That, is s. problem* but one that w® would have to
address if the Court were to overrule Spector or the bright-line
test»
QUESTION? The real problem is that you say Mississippi
is getting too much tax money?
MR. PERRYs

No* sir* I think that —

QUESTION: Well* you agreed to pay the other taxes*

MR. PERRYs
taxes

Yes* sir* we agreed to pay the otter

16

QUESTIONS

You didn't dispute those*

That's your

real problem,, isn't it?
MR* PERRY;

No, sir, I don't think that we have said

that w© can quantify the amount we're paying, and that that
exceeds the amount of benefits that the State has bean —■
QUESTION;

No, I didn't say that*

I said, isn’t

your real — you admit you're subject to taxes by th© State of
Mississippi*
MR* PERRYs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir»
Your objection is this is too much*

MR» PERRY;

No, sir, our objection is that this is a

privilege tax, and that
QUESTION;

That it’s too much*

MR* PERRY;

No, sir*

Our objection also is that

this is not a tax that we would have paid if the Stat© had
been entitled to levy it in 1968 through 1972* This tax would
have been passed along to General Motors, presumably to its
dealers, and presumably to new car customers during 1968 to
1972 *
We relied on the bright-line test*

It's too late

to pass -the tax along.
In essence, by relying on Spector, we are now
we have no remedy -- th© thing that's taxed, we would not have
been required
QUESTION;

Just for myself, you would do better by

17

just talking about Spector, instead of talking about the
bright line*

QUESTIONS

I’m sorry, sir, I didn’t **I know®

QUESTION; Well, what decision is it you say that
you relied on the Specter case?

may not levy a privilege tax on interstate commerce, even
if th© tax is nondiscriminatory and fairly apportioned®
But —•
QUESTIONS Well, do you think — go ahead, finish
your answer®
MR.PERRYs

Of course, that decision was in 1951,

I believe, in 1954 there was the first Railway Express case,
and sine© that time the rule has been recognised in other
decisions of this Court, not the basis of a holding®
QUESTIONS Well, do you think it's necessarily a
basis of a sort of reliance -that you are going to assert in
&■ constitutional sense, to pick out the case that’s most

favorable to you and say, We relied on that? and, in effect,
ignore the Memphis Gas case?
MR® PERRYs

Well, a taxpayer in the situation of

Corap let© Auto cannot afford to say, well, maybe yes and maybe
no? they have got to make a decision as to whether to pass this
tax along or not

18
The decision was made to rely on the latest cases,
all of which are after the earlier cases that might indicate
that there’s some doubt as to the invalidity of this tax.
They would
QUESTION;

Aren’t you — as I read your brief, you

are, in affect, saying that if the Legislature is foolish
enough to say we're levying this tax expressly upon the
privilege of doing an exclusively interstate business — and
that’s all they say *—* that it’s unconstitutional under
Spector and that line of cases?

That’s the end of the whole

inquiry.
MR. PERRY;

Yes, sir, I think the State would have

a difficult time contending that a ~
QUESTIGN:

No, but isn’t that what your argument is,

based on what we said last term in Colonial?
MR. PERRY;

Yes, sir, I think that there is a

difference between the label and the incident of the tax.
As we pointed out, I believe the privilege tax presents
dangers that other taxes -that a more aptly worded statute
would avoid.

If you have a privilege tax, th@re is always

the possibility —
QUESTION;
if Spector

Well, even though all this is so,

■ if you're right in relying on Spector, once

you establish 'that that’s what this tax is, and 'that’s the
way -the tax statute is written, you’re entitled to win?

19
MR. PERRY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: That’s what I thought,
MR. PERRY:

That’s our position.

QUESTION:

It would be bright line, isn't it —-

QUESTION:

But, I take it — do you read the

Mississippi Supreme Court as saying that ~ as conceding or
accepting that this transportation was the last leg of an
inters tate journey?
MR. PERRY:

We read the Supreme Court as conceding

that this was interstate commerce.

The tax mentioned

even —
QUESTION:

Yes.

It’s not saying that this last leg

was not part of interstate commerce, it did not say that?
MR. PERRY;

No.» sir.

Even the Tax Commission’s

brief concedes that, at best — they didn’t say Mat best” —
that tiie Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide the
issue. They certainly made no holding that it was intra­
state commerce.
And the Chancery Court’s opinion is even clearer,
Your Honor, I think it's apparent —■ although he doesn’t
say this is interes tate commerce, that that’s the substance of
his opinion.
Wall, the form of the documents is really the only
question, Mr. Justice White, on whether .this is interstat© or
intrastate.

They argue that because the goods were consigned

20

to General Motors in care of Complete Auto, that that makes
this somehow intrastate commerce, and, indeed, they even
suggest that General Motors took possession of the —
QUESTION; Well, that isn’t what the Mississippi
courts held, thoughe
MR» PERRYs

No, sir»

I was going to point out that

we’re not convinced, and neither of the Mississippi courts
were convinced, and we think your Court, this Court should
agree with the Mississippi courts and conclude that this is
interstate, commerce»

And the only question is whether a

privilege tax can be levied»
There's no question that this is a privilege tax»
It’s been consistently construed as a privilege tax by -the
Mississippi Supreme Court»

There’s no question that the

tax is a condition precedent to compliance with the statute»
It’s a condition precedent to engaging in business in
interstate commerce in Mississippi, although we don’t think it
would be controlling whether it were or not» The Tax
Commission's brief made the argument that it’s not a condition
precedent, and, of course, our brief cites the statuta which
we believe establishes that it definitely is in interstate
commerce, — excuse me, that it definitely is a condition
precedent to engaging in business»
Our original brief discussed at length the
recognition which w© think that Congress has afforded to

21
Spector*

It's reviewed this entire area of State taxation

in interstate commerce* W© believe that her© w© have the sort
of positive inaction, that this Court recognized in Flood v„
?
Kuhn# and if this case — if# Mr. Justice Blackmun# Spetctor
is an aberration# referring to your opinion in Colonial
Pipeline# we think that it’s an aberration -that's been so long
recognised by Congress and so much relied on by the tsuip&yers
that this Court should leave it to Congress to correct any
of th© problems that might ha apparent or not apparent in the
rule *
By that we do not mean to concede
QUESTION:

*

You mean you relied upon them in the

sense you just ignore the State tax?

MRo PERRY: We did not ignore the State tax# I
think tli at -QUESTION:

Well# you said you wouldn’t pay it.

MR. PERRY:

Well# yes# sir# I suppose w© would

have had to either ignore toe Constitution or the Stato tax#
and we chose to rely on th© Constitution.
QUESTION:

At least you relied on it in th© sense

you didn't pass it on.
MR. PERRY:

Y@s# sir.

And# of course# if you’re

going to tack a. cost like that on# you’ve got to tack it on
so the dealer can pass it along to his customers# or else
•someone is going to be left, absorbing the burden of it# that

22
otherwise shouldn't;.
If you had just on© customer and he was going to
absorb it on® way or the other* it might not b© such a
difficult problem*
For the reasons stated* that this is transportation
in interstate commanes and that the State may not levy a
privilege tax on interstate commerce* we suggest that the
decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is totally
inconsistent with the opinions of this Court*

It didn’t

cite Spector* it didn’t cite Railway Express* it didn’t cite
Colonial Pipeline.

Either w© were not eloquent in urging

those cases* mid we discussed them at length* or else the
court deliberately chose to ignore their precedent.
For reasons stated* we think the decision should be
reversed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Very well.
Mr. Haddock.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES II. HADDOCK* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. HADDOCK;

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas©

the Court;
I tliink the facts are most important in this case
precisely as to how this activity took place* and I first
might add that the Mississippi sales tax is required by

23
statute to be passed on to the consumer at the time of sale?
by adding the appropriate amount of -the tax to the bill.
And if this Court follows the majority opinion in the Joseph B.
McGoldrick vs. Berwind-White Corap any , in which , in the
majority opinion, they stated that a tax of this nature
and the New York tax in that case was exactly like the tax
in Mississippi — and the court, by a majority opinion, found
ill at the incidence of -the tax was on the consumer,,

This is

a consumer tax, it's to ba the sales tax in Mississippi ~
which, incidentally, was the first State to have a workable
sales tax, that we passed in 19 32.
It is a consumer tax.

It says -that it is a

privilege tax, and we don't doubt — we don't demy that it is
a privilege tax.

But it is a tax placed on the privilege of

conducting certain intrastate events, which are listed?
the sale of property or the sales .of services which are
performed exclusively within the State of Mississippi.
In tli© case of the truck lines, the travel from on©
point within Mississippi to another point within'Mississippi.
In this particular case, we might look at the
actual transaction, as the exhibits indicate, and determine
our position as to why we think this is clearly intrastate
commerce that has been taxed, or an intrastate activity at
the conclusion or the termination of the shipment from a
consignor in on® State to a consignor in —- to -the consign©©

24

in another State»
There is just the same situation that you would
have if somebody would send freight in by rail line to a
merchant# and he hired somebody to go down to the railroad
and pick it up and bring it to his business»

It's an

exclusively intrastate activity# that the dealers# General
Motors wanted to be sure that tine property was sent from the
railhead to the dealer’s front door# and the dealer wouldn't
be required to go pick it up himself# that this service was
performed.
QUESTION!

Mr» Haddock# on. the facts of this case#

■these vehicles go to Meridian and they are changed from one
railroad to another# well# why don't you tax the M©ridian~t©~
Jackson part of it?
MR. HADDOCK:
that charge.

There-.was no sale of a services on

That was on a through bill of lading# from the

assembly plant -QUESTION! Then you rely on the bill of lading?
MR» HADDOCK! Well# to a degree# yes# sir# we rely
on a bill of lading# because in today's complexities of
modem business you've got to rely on some kind of commercial
transactions in tax matters.
QUESTION: Well# my other question is that, if# on
these trucks# they have three vehicles to be delivered in
Mississippi and.two to go to Louisiana, all on the sans

25

MR® HADDOCK;

Regardless -- yes, the same vehicle

could be used®
In this particular case* General Motors shipped their
automobiles from General Motors assembly plant in Georgia
to General Motors Assembly Division in Jackson, Mississippi,
as th© consignee, by rail on a rail bill of lading.

They

were then unloaded onto a large lot, and the Mississippi
Supreme Court said that up until that particular point General
Motors had control of this property, they could do with it as
they saw fit®

They could sell it to somebody else, they could

transfer it to another dealer.

The consignment was shipped

to themselves as consignee.
As c. matter of fact, in th® Convoy case,

Convoy vs®

26
Washington [sic], which was decided after Spector, that was
an identical case to this, on fact in law, and fact involved,
the only difference was feat Ford Motor Company was the
manufacturer of the automobiles and Convoy was the shipper
of the cars. There was no difference.

All of the other facts

of any importance were exactly th© same?

the same procedure

was used.
And in that case, the Ford officials said that they
used this method of shipment in order to protect themselves
in case a dealer should go bankrupt after the cars were
shipped, prior to th© shipment in Mississippi, or, in the
case that they wanted to demand a cash payment for the cars
when they shipped them out of Jackson by the carrier.
They maintained control, and toe Mississippi Supreme
Court said 'that they maintained control up to that point, be­
cause they had shipped them the cars from themselves out of
State to themselves in the State.
QUESTIONS

What if each of to© dealers had sent

some kind of a vehicle to this point in Mississippi and taken
toe cars to their own distribution point themselves, would
there be

could you levy any extra tax on them?■
MR. HADDOCK:

If toe dealer, the Mississippi dealer sent — yes,
sir, we would levy th© same tax ©a them.
QUESTIONs Do any of them do that, do you know?

27

MR® HADDOCK:

Well, yes, sir, I can 'tell you from

experience, I used to own a dealership — not exactly to
this extent, but my property was sent to the railroad and I
sent -- I unloaded it and had it brought to my plant.

And if

I engaged somebody to do it, and was used regularly, I paid
them the sales tax on this transportation.
There is a fine line of demarcation, and everybody
realizes just where interstate commerce breaks, there is no
way that anybody can actually tell, and you have to uses some
kind of different solution in every case that's dependent on
the facte in the situation that is existing there, which
clearly indicate the purposes of in-bent from -the paperwork
that's involved.
Now, our position has always been, and we think that
the Mississippi Supreme Court said, that this was intrastate
commerce, that this was a local activity.

It may have been

related to or connected with it in soma way, but it was not
interstat® commerce.

The reason they could not have found

that ife was interstate commerce is that they based their
opinion in this case, and they say that three cases control

MR. HADDOCK:

I'm not sure about that, but in that

case, that involved through shipments from a consignor outrofState to a consignee in-State.

There was no local acdtivity

whatsoever, no local commercial transactions within -the State
of Connecticut.

And I think Spector is on© of our strongest

supporters, actually, in what the Court said,
The Court looked for -the local incident of the
local activity, the presence of that activity, on which to
base their decision.
But they couldn’t find it. There was no local
activity in Spector.

They had no commercial transactions

involved in — except for the movement of commerce from one
point in Connecticut, to a point outside the State of
Connecticut.

QUESTIOH;

W® don't tax ~

Well, ~

Didn't you?

MR. HADDOCK;

The principle — possibly so, but

it’s very difficult to answer that question, because you
don't know how they handle that transaction in Meridian,
you don't know how — whether they have control of it, what
the shipping documents say, who the property belongs to at
that particular time.

It would be very difficult to say

without looking at the documents.
QUESTION; Well, I understood your answers to
Justice Marshall's questions to boil down to conceding that
if tills is interstate commerce involved in this case, you
do not .have power to tax it under your statute, and you tell
me if I'm mistaken ~
MR. HADDOCK;

No, sir, that general statement I

do not agree with? no, sir.
QUESTION;

Well, then why don't you ~~ why wouldn't

you tax the truck trip from Meridian to Jackson, in his

You have an absolute duty to apply this tax

Y©s, sir, I would think so,

But

there —
QUESTIONs Then why wouldn't you tax that?
MR. HADDOCKs

You would have to look at the facts«

QUESTIONS Well, you told hixn you wouldn't tax ito
MR. HADDOCKs

Well, we may not — we probably

wouldn't tax it, because we wouldn't know about all of the —
we don't know about all the transactions, that we can't
determine the facts in every case of shipment in ©very situation
that comes up.
We have adopted the principle, in the Tax Commission,
that we will not tax any part of transportation from a
consignor out of the State to a consignor in the State.
QUESTION; Well, may I ask again; Why have you
adopted that policy?
MR. HADDOCKs Well, because it is uncertain, it has
bean so uncertain as to just what part of a transportation
cost that you could tax.

The law —* it has not been firmly

established in my mind as to just what point of demarcation
— now, as to property tax, as to State tax, income tax,
t

the Court has been very agreeable to go along with it. But
in the field of transportation, it gets to be, as the Court
says, a thorny problem.

You can't really decide where the

line of demarcation is, but the Court has, I believe, --

QUESTION! Between what and what?
MR. HADDOCK!

Sir?

QUESTION? Between local commerce and interstate
commerce.
MR. HADDOCK!
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.
And if it's interstate commerce, you

can* t tax it? is that right?
MR. HADDOCK;

Nell, basically, you couldn't tax it

if the incidence of 'this tax was on the privilege of doing an
interstate business.

I think this Court has established that.

If it's for some other purpose, I think you can.
Now, our question ■—

That's the question I ask you now.

MR. HADDOCKs

Well, constitutionally, in my ©pinion.

40

I have to start with the basic preraise that interstate commerce
should pay its own way.

It should be treated exactly like any

other commerce» so long as there's not a barrier thrown up
to prevent the free flow of trade.
Mow» actually» as far as ray philosophy is concerned,
I think that interstat® commerce should pay its own way» and
there's only two philosophies:

on©, that it pays its ovm

wayj or one that you can't put any tax on and you can't
burden it and you can't do anything with it.
You can’t — but the Court has a vary difficult
probiora» they would have to look at each case individually
to arrive at a satisfactory method of handling

the cases.

They don’t have too much guidance from Congress on it, they
just have one simple statement there.

This transaction has to be completely within,

not from without to within.
QUESTION;

Yes if 'that truck buys gas in Mississippi,

the State could certainly charge a tax on the gas purchased,

MR. HADDOCK;

They certainly can.

QUESTION; Well, why can’t it charge it on the portion

43
of the journey — the revenue derived from the portion of the
journey that takes place inside Mississippi?
MR® HADDOCKs

I think — my personal opinion is

that they certainly could.

But under -the opinions of the

Supreme Court, we have been fearful of attempting to tax that
portion, especially in view of the language in the dissenting
opinions in the cases, and the philosophies that were involved
in them.
It’s a very close question that we are cognisant of,
and we have tried our best not to get over into the question
of taxation of a shipment -from without the State to within the

a consignee within the State,

MR, HADDOCK:

I think Spector, personally, should b©

— well, I’ll say this, teat it’s a vary critical — I don’t
like the aspects, because I -think they were doing business

44
in the State that would give the State of Connecticut an
opportunity to ..impose this tax. They were operating a big
business here with 126 employees, they were operating trucks
running around town.

As far as I'm concerned, they were

doing business in the State.

But they were not -- this was a

convenience that they were doing, picking up goods and taking
them to the point of shipment. They were not doing a
commercial transaction — conducting a commercial -business
transaction.

confused,, I merely say that I am* too,
QUESTIONS

Well, don't admit it!

[Laughter, ]
QUESTION:

By all means* admit it,

MS, HADDOCK?

Thank you,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Do you have anything
further* Mr, Perry?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN W. PERRY * ESQ,*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, PERRY:

Jurat for a moment* Your Honor,

I think it's apparent that this whole case turns
on th© form of 'the documents,

If you have two bills of lading*

you ar© taxable? if you have on© bill of lading* you're not,
QUESTION: You're not conceding that?
MR, PERRY:

That’s his opinion.

No* sir* v/© don’t concede that; at all,

I hope that

it’s apparent that w© think -that that has absolutely no merit
at all.

But that’s th© only factor that the Commission has

looked at* and it’s really th© only on® that th© Commission
has advanced to this Court.
QUESTION: Well* at least you have a curbston© opinion
as to how you can avoid th® tax* in th© future,
MR. PERRY:

Yes* sir.

But th© tax has even been

49
repealed now, since 1972. We're talking about money we're
out of pocket for 1968 through 1972.
Mr0 Justice Marshall asked whether General Motors
had any one present at the point where the vehicles were
transferred from the railroad to the motor carriers. They did
not. The testimony is clear that they didn't, and the
chancellor specifically found, on page — in his portion of
the opinion on page 100 of th© Appendix, that General Motors
had absolutely nothing further to do with th© vehicles after

they were transported.
Nevertheless, Mr. Haddock said in his brief, and
said again here -today, that somehow or another the transporta-”
tion ended in Jackson, because -the consignee was General
Motors in care of Complete Auto.

We think, in light of the

undisputed facts, that that contention has no merit.
Finally, with regard to Mr. Haddock's argument about
local activity, which h© defines as the transportation itself,
it seems to me

and he talks about a commercial activity —

it seams to ma that's just another way of saying this was
intrastate commerce.

What he tries to carve up is no more

than a portion of the interstate journey.

He's conceded this

tax is not levied on any such local incidents as the us© of
property, purchase of fuel, ownership of property, or incidents
which the tax would be validly levied on.
Thus, we submit it’s clear that this tax isn’t

50

levied on any local incidents .
There are a number of incidents that the State of
Mississippi canid and does tax.

This tax just isn't one of

those taxes.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you# gentlemen.

The case, is submitted.
[Whereupon# at 2;05 o’clock# p.m.f the case in the
above^entitled matter was submitted.j
