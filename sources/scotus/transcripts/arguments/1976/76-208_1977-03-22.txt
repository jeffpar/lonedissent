MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

next in Nyquist against Mauclet, Number 76-208.
Mrs. Gordon,, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JUDITH A. GORDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANTS
MRS. GORDON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
New York offers grants and subsidised loans to
undergraduate and graduate students among its higher education
assistance programs.
Only grants are directly in issue on this
appeal, particularly Regents' college scholarships,
which are awarded competitively on the basis of performance
on an examination, and tuition assistance awards, known
as TAP, which are available to any qualified student.
The question presented is whether New York may f
consistent with the Equal Protection clause, offer these
grants to State residents who are citizens, to aliens
willing to become citizens, and to certain alien refugees,
necessarily excluding other aliens, including aliens like
appellees herein, who are permanent residents, but who have
refused to become citizens.
The Mauclet case was instituted in the Western

4
District of New York in February, 1975«,

The Rahinoviteh

action was instituted in the Eastern District of New York
in August of '74.
Both cases were determined by a Three Judge District
Court in the Eastern District which ended in a judgment from
which this appeal is taken.
Now appelleeMauclef is a French citizen, and
ha has been a permanent resident-alien in the United States
since 1969.

He is a graduate student at. the State University

of New York at the time the judgment below was entered, and
he had been denied a tuition assistance award as a graduate
student for the 74-75 academic year on the basis of the
State statute involved, 5e*cfion 661, because, in essence,
he refused to become an American citizen.
Appellee Rahinoviteh is Canadian.

He has bean

a permanent resident in New York and in the United States since»
1964.

He was an undergraduate student at Brooklyn College

in the City of New York when the judgment was entered, and
he Was denied a. Regents' college scholarship for the same
academic year as involved in' the Mauclet case because, again,
he refused to apply for American citizenship.

Indeed, as

he states in his affidavit filed below, he has no-

intention

of applying for American, citizenship.
QUESTIONS

Mrs. Gordon, how much are we talking about

in dollars, do you have any idea?

5

MRS. GORDON:

Yes, your Honor, we do.

exactly the figures, as a matter of fact.

We have

The direct student

aid program which is involved -— which — and with specific
reference to Regents5 college scholarships and to tuition
assistance is $208 million in the State of New York for
this present fiscal period, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, how many aliens are there who would

be eligible if the judgment of this court were upheld?

How

much are we talking about in dollars from that point of
view, or don't you know?
MRS. GORDON:
on that.

Your Honor, frankly I can't respond

It's not as though vie didn't try to get the statistics,

but because vie have a program which has foreclosed some
aliens, we do not know what opening that program would mean.
And indeed, statistics that would be more potentially
relevant, namely an age category of permanent resident
aliens in New York were not available from the Immigration
and Naturalisation service.

The ones that were just

completely unrealistic.
QUESTION:

Of course that's the question I asked

is how much are we litigating about
MRS. GORDON:

in this lawsuit.

Oh, I'm sorry.

What would be the

difference in cost.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MRS. GORDON:

Unfortunately, your Honor, we

6

cannot project that»
QUESTION;

We may not be speaking about very

much»
MRS. GORDON:

That1s correct, your Honor, we may

not be speaking about very much»

However, given the quality

of this scholarship program as a selection program, it does
have an extension in terms of other scholarships which
necessarily equally selection programs, and they may
involve a. much greater public cost.
Now Regents scholarships —
QUESTION:

And I suppose it isn’t particularly a

question of cost anyway, if these people are eligible,
it excludas others who might otherwise get qualified.
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Exactly, your Honor.

It's a-

question of who will get a

piece of the pie-.
MRS. GORDON:

Of course, your Honor.

At the base

of any selection program that involves a public benefit
is, of course, ultimately a finite resource.

And of course

the question then becomes, who has the better demand on
that resource, the people who are included, or all people who
are now excluded?
QUESTION:

The kind of grants you are talking about

here are not ultimately repayable, I take its they're
not loans?

7
HRS. GORDON:

That is exactly right, your Honor»

The Regents' scholarships and the TAP awards are pure
grants in aid; they are gifts.
Now a separate issue is in fact raised in this case
with respect to student loans which, by definition, are
repayable.
Now, the State statute in issue, Section 661, covers
student loans»

And Appellee Rabinovitch

has attempted to

place the regulation of that statute vis a vis student
loans in .issue in this case.
We contested his standing to do that below, and
the issue was determined against us.

We have .reraised it

on this appeal, and it raises some very significant
questions»
However, 1 think it's sufficient at this point
to point out to you that to the extent that loans are
in fact subsidised by public money, they are to that extent
gifts, and can be fairly analogized to the grants program.
QUESTION:

Well, but. I would think that you would hav

an argument available to you in the loan situation that you
don’t have in the grants situation, that someone who insists
on remaining a national of Portugal is much more apt to
avoid services of process if New York tries to compel payment
of a loan 20 years from now, than someone who is a resident
of the United States.

8
MRS. GORDON s

That8s exactly right, your Honor.

And it’s our position on this appeal, even putting aside
the standing question, that a remand would need to be had on
the loan issue to raise, indeed, the issue you just mentioned,
namely, whether there was a basis to infer that there
was this additional rationale that the aliens unwilling to
become a citizen, would be more likely to leave the jurisdiction and not return than the alien who was willing to
become a citizen.
And we do seek a remand, or we believe that unless
861 can be sustained under the Equal Protection clause,
that

to invalidate the statute would require this remand,

because wa would want to raise that additional issue,
including some other additional issues that pertain specifically
to loans, because they are partially federally subsidized.
The grants in aid, the TAP awards, and the Regents1 college
scholarships are not, in fact, in any way federally
subsidized.

They are completely state funds.

QUESTION:

Mrs. Gordon, I’m not. sure it would

make — at least for me — make any difference whether
it was 100,000 a year or 10 million a year.

Rut if the

District Court is correct, is it unreasonable to speculate
that this might bring an influx, of graduate students from
countries all over the world who would beat a path to our
door?

9

MRS. GORDON %

Absolutely.

That's exactly the

problem — or, the question you pose is exactly the problem
that arises when any program that was formally closed is now
opened, and we attempt to calculate what would happen.
Now, obviously, if any alien knew that by his mere
presence in the state, either as an immigrant or possibly as a
non-immigrant, he could get aid to education, he would
presumably want to come here.
Now, it's -QUESTION:

Mrs. Gordon, do you think the government

is powerless to keep the aliens from coming?
MRS„ GORDON %

Do 1 think the government is power­

less to keep the aliens from coming?
QUESTION?

Yes.

MRS. GORDON:

You mean the state government or

the federal government?
QUESTION:

The federal government.

MRS. GORDON:

Of course not, your Honor.

Of

course not.
QUESTION:
great influx.

So I don't understand about this

We could stop that easily.

MRS. GORDON:

Well, I don't know whether they

could stop them from — whether it would even be realistic
to assume, your Honor, that they could stop them from settling
in New York State, once they were admitted to the United

10
States.
However, I should point —
QUESTION:

What about United States citizens who are

say native Californians who come to New York and stay there
temporarily.

Are they eligible?

MRS, GORDON:

There is a durational residence

requirement for TAP awards and for collega scholarships,
your Honor.
QUESTION:

Would the influx problem be any

different for worrying about people coming from California
than from France, say?
MRS, GORDON?

Well, I think it would be different

at least to this extent, your Honor.

California, for

example, happens to have one of the most major public
university systems in the United States, -and probably has a
durational residence requirement incident to its system,
°kxch could be met by an individual going from New York,

within a fairly brief period of time, to California.

Now

the same principle, I don't —
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume there’s a state — •

are there any states that have less desirable programs
than New York does?
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

I believe so, your Honor.

Well, let me take such a state for

my hypothetical example, then.

Ii
Would your influx problem be any different for
people who 1ive in such a state as compared to people who live
in a country with ~~ foreign country with a less desirable
program?

I suppose it’s probably a greater possibility that

they'd come from neighboring states.

You know, they're

more apt to know about it, and one thing and another.
We're just worrying about the influx problem.
MRS. GORDONS

Yes, well, I think it's obvious,

your Honor, that New York, California, and indeed, there
are many states i.n the Union which offer enhanced benefits
f;

programs, and possibly for that reason have been population
centers within the United States.

In other words, they

have attracted people to the United States.
Certainly, that was true historically in terms
of the North being more attractive to some individuals
that the South.
However, there are, I think, a couple of points
that need to ba emphasised.
First of all, with respect to Canada, for
example, Canada states very plainly in its information
office through its consulate that it provides no grants
in aid of any kind to undergraduate students.

Now, I

do not have the law on that, although I do have a booklet.
Now, obviously, appellee Rablnovitcfc is getting
in the Onited States what, the American student who went

12
to his homeland could not get in Canada»
Now we attempted to check out the situation with
France, your Honor, but the information was, frankly, not
available to us,
QUESTION;

Mrs. Gordon, what would you regard as

the primary purpose of the statute?
a few that you — in your remarks.

I think I have sensed
But tell me what you

think are the primary purposes of the statute?
MRS. GORDON;

Your Honor, the statute operates, in

terms of its purposes, and in our view, in a very close nexus
with the type of classification that’s involved.
Now, we have indicated — we have argued, and
we believe that the legislative history directly supports
this, that the statute has a specific purpose in enhancing
the educational level of the individuals in New York State
who are willing to become identified with that State,
namely, those individuals who undertake the responsibilities
of citizenship.
QUESTION;

Isn't that a federal concern, rather

than a state concern, number one.

And number two, how

do you defeat what Mr. Justice Stevens has been talking
about, having a great influx from other states, you can
say New Jersey and Connecticut if you want, rather than
go away across the country, who might think they can get
a better deal in New York, and they’re willing to be there for

13
a rev; years?
How do you defeat that?

You admit them to your

program, don’t you?
To put it another way, isn’t this the same argument
that was made here in re Griffith and all the other alien
cases?
MRS„ GORDON;
your Honor.,

To take the last point first, no,

First of all, the influx problem, I think we
\

should perceive it this way: the statute, the classification
involved, does ask the alien to declare his intent to
become a citizen, or to apply for it»

That is some evidence

of his willingness to stay in New York.
The interstate resident who comes into New York to
live, and meets the durational residence requirement is
already a citizen, your Honor.

He is fully eligible by

virtue of his birth or naturalization in his prior places
of abode to participate —
QUESTION:

~~ that’s my point, you

MRS» GORDON:

see.

Well, the point is that once the

citizen satisfied the durational residence requirement,
he is able to participate in the state community to the
same extent as the state resident who was already here.
The alien cannot accept that ~ refuses that kind of
responsibility until the point in time when he becomes
naturalized.

14
QUESTION:

He cannot participate in what sense?

Voting?
MRS. GORDON:

He cannot vote, he cannot he an

office holder, he cannot be a juror, he cannot be a police­
man.

And indeed, with respect to —>
QUESTION:

Well, some of those issues are under

consideration here right now.
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Well, Perkins versus —

I don't think we can assume them.

MRS. GORDON %

I’m sorry, your Honor.

Smith was affirmed by this Court.

Perkins versus

And that's the State

juror case, your Honor.
There is certainly quite plain language in
Dougall versus Sugarman and other opinions of this Court
that within off .iceholding categories, the stats may indeed
use citizenship as a criteria for those types of positions.
In the case I believe you mentioned that's
before you now for disposition here is Foley versus Connelie
which in the Southern District sustained its citizenship
limitation for police officers.
.QUESTIONs

Does it bar them from admittance to

the state universities?
MRS. GORDON:
raised that.,

No, your Honor.

I'm glad you

Because that’s one of the points at issue —

QUESTION s

Anc the difference is?

15
MRS. GORDON?

The difference?

First of all,

the financial difference is very substantial.

The direct

student aid budget, a portion of which I gave you before, as
I said, was $208 million.

One and a quarter billion dollars

is spent by the State of New York in sponsoring its state
public university and in providing contributions to city
universities,
Now the whole purpose — and some independent
colleges — the whole purpose of that program is to provide
reduced tuition rates.

Nov; those reduced tuition rates

are available to aliens with very minor exceptions not
here relevant, and to citizens on like terms.
New, as you indicated, your Honor, there is a dif­
ference.

Why should New York then say with respect to

this particular limited category of awards, ws are going
to exclude some aliens?
I think the answer, your Honor, must be that this
is a limited program seeking a limited purpose, namely ~~
QUESTION;

So the other money is just given away?

You aren't required to, you say.
MRS. GORDON;
QUESTION;

I don’t believe that we are.

Did I understand you to say that you could

exclude them?
MRS. GORDON;
QUESTION;

From reduced tuition, your Honor.

From admission.

IS
MRS. GORDONS
QUESTION %

From admission to New York State?

New York State University.

If they' ve

got a million dollars, and they’re paying their own way.

Could

you exclude them because they're aliens?
MRS. GORDONS

Well, your Honor, I don’t — obviously

the question is not squarely presented by this case.

I

would think that certainly that an exclusion like that would
parallel cases like Graham versus Richardson, would, parallel
cases like Sugarman versus Douga11, with a foreclosure on
the access of the alien to a substantial program which is
very meaningful to him would indeed probably burden his
access or burden his ability to enter and abide in the
United States inconsistently with the Truax cbctrine —
QUESTION s

Could you charge an alien with

*

✓

!

non-resident tuition equal to what you charge non-resident
students who are citizens of the United States?
MRS. GORDON:

Your Honor, that issue was

considered in a recent lower court case, and it held that
all aliens could not be classified in terms of reduced to —
as non

-residents for reduced tuition purposes.

And I

think that example again erects a much more substantial
barrier —
QUESTION;

Do you confine — do you confine your

loan and scholarship program to residents of New York?
MRS. GORDON:

Yes, w-a do, your Honor.

17
QUESTION:
they're citizens?

And hence, if they're residents,
Of New York?

MRS. GORDON:

No, your Honor.

Merely to be a

resident of New York is not to be a citizen of New York.
QUESTION:

Well, when do you get to be a citizen?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Well, a citizen of New York —

I mean, say I moved to New York from

New Jersey, and I'm going to reside there.

You mean I’m

not a citizen?
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

No? as an American —

Well, that's what I’m asking you.

If

I become a resident of New York moving from another state,
am I a citizen?
MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your are, your Honor.

All right.

So you confine your loan and

scholarship program to citizens?
MRS» GORDON:

No, your honor.

We confine our

loans and scholarship program to citizens who are residents

of the Statefor a particular period of time, and wg also
provide the loans and scholarships —

QUESTION:

I'm not — you cannot — the net effect

of your program is, whether I'm a citizen of the — even
though I'm a citizen of the United States, I cannot participate:
in your loan program unless I'm a citizen of New York.

MRS. GORDON:

That is correct.

18

QUESTION:

Because I have to be a resident.

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

All right.

So you aren’t really

treating the alien very much differently.

Ke still has

to bs a citizen.
MRS. GORDON:

Well, exactly, except, that the program

is somewhat broader than that insofar as the alien can
get the benefit of the statute without in fact becoming a
citizen.

He can get it in effect if he has a certain

refugee status, and he can get it in the process of becoming
a citizen.
That is why it is somewhat — it is not, indeed —
QUESTIONs

Whatif there is some barrier to his becom­

ing a citizen, which you can't control?
MRS. GORDONs

Exactly.

He cannot presently become

a citizen, h® is allowed to declare his intent.
Now, your point your Honor distinguishes this
c

, I think very materially, from prior cases that we've had

that tha Court has recently reviewed in two ways.
first of all, the classifications in Graham, in
£339

Sugarman, in

Pe-Otero

, were in fact classifications

based on alienage, the status off alienage.
Now, we have argued that this is not such a
c;i ossification.

And 1 believe it is incumbent upon us

ho show you that it is not such a classification either in

19

logic or as a matter of reality.
It is not such a. classification because the
mere offer of the statement, alienage, under this statute,
gets you nowhere.
something else.

The statute requires alienage and
We have said that that is the statement by

the alien to the extent that he is willing to identify with
what we believe are the interests we believe are served by
the statutes.
And he gets the money, in reality, he gets the
money for the entire duration of his alien status, assuming
he makes the corcmitment that is requested by the statute.
Now, the statute is also very different from
Graham and all these other cases in this respects in Graham
and the cases noted, the alien was barred from access to ■—
as ws noted — very substantial programs by governmental
bar.

The foreclosure was as a specific result of the

governmental action.

There was nothing that the alien could

do to get the benefit of that program.
In this situation, the statute places the decision
making upon the alien.

He may or xaay not wish to make the

commitment that the statute offers to him, but if he in fact
makes it, he gets the benefit of the program immediately.
Now, as I indicated, there are certain specific, and
we believe, substantial interests involved in the program.
And they are —

20

QUESTIOTis

Well another

father large difference

between this case and the others to which reference has been
made , and maybe you touched on it and 1 didn't understand it,
is that this involves a system of state largesse, giving
money away.
MRS» GORDONS

Yes, exactly„

And I think we should

ask what the consequence of that type of system is as
compared to the consequence of denying an alien —
QUESTION:

Job opportunities»

MRS» GORDON:
QUESTION:

Or job opportunities.

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION;

*— for example, welfare benefits.

Or job opportunities, right,

Or something to which he is statutorily

entitled.
MRS. GORDON:

Those can fairly be said, I believe,

to burden his right to enter and abide.

However, if we

give some group of individuals simply a gift, 1 do not
t. hink that we cart fairly say that we are burdening or penalis­
ing the individuals who do not receive the gift.

For

example, I do not think that the in-state limitation, the
irv state residence limitation, that is annexed to this type
of program, a residence limitation essentially approved by
377

this Court in

Viandis v. Kline

can realistically

say that we are burdening New Jersey residents who do not gat
the benefit of this program.

This Court affirmed the opinion

%

21

of Spatt versus New York , which involved specifically the
use of Regents' college scholarships»
Now, in fact, the individual who brought the
claim vranted to take his Regents’ college scholarship and use
it in New Jersey.

Now, we don’t permit that.

scholarship has to be used in New York.

The college

And he argued that

it’s our preclusion of his use of that scholarship in
New Jersey penalised him, and this Court affirmed a decision
which said that there was indeed no penalty involved.
Now, in contrast to the tuition assistance program,
1* indicated to you previotssly the amount
amount of money that was involved.

of the —- the total

But whereas the tuition

assistance program, in our view, potentially involves a fore­
closure of access, the“program hare involved is, as I say,
limited in terras of the gross amount involved, and very limited
in terras of the amount of benefits that any individual receives,
namely
QUESTION:

The State also, quote, to use the

word, largesse, but what about the amount of money that is put
into the university?

What is that?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

That’s a huge amount.

It certainly is, your Honor,

You can’t bar them from that.

But your

point is you can’t bar them from that, but you can bar them
frcm this extra — is that a better way of putting it?
MRS. GORDONs

I think — I do not think that the

22

issue of whether you could bar aliens from reduced tuition
has been finally resolved.

As I indicated to you, there

is one lower court opinion on the point.

I do believe

that the issue of barring an individual from an access to a
publically sponsored education whan, for example# in Calif”
ornia,

the state system is the preeminent system within

that territory# places a much more substantial foreclosure on
the alien than denying him a gift.
And here, as 1 was about to indicate, the dimension
of that gift, in terms of a Regents' scholarship, is now
$250 annually.

The dimension of the tuition assistance

award is between $100 and $1,500, depending on the income
level of the individual.

However, the first $200 of such

awardsare necessarily in debt, and there is an income ceiling
with respect to — an income ceiling with respect to the
eligibility of the candidate to receive the awards»
So that we are not talking about, and the legis­
lative history certainly dees not purport to say, that this
is

program which is intended to subsidise the complete

cost of education.

The major subsidy comes at the end of the

comes inthe reduced tuition.
Thank you, your Honor,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there ah

one o'clock, Mrs. Gordon.
[Whereupon, at 12?00 o'clock, noon, the Court was

recessed, to reconvene at Is00 o'clock,, p.m., the same day.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Davidson,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DAVIDSON, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE MAUCLET
MR. DAVIDSON:

Mr. Chief

Justice, may it please

the Court:
Jean-Marie Mauclet is the husband of a citizen.
And he and his wife have a citizen child.

He is an immigrant

to this country, and ha is entitled by the Congress of the
United States, to make this his permanent home.
If the judgment -—
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference if he didn’t,

have an American wife or an American child?
MR. DAVIDSON:

Yes, I think it would make a

difference in that fact that he

has an American

wife and

an American child makes his residency in this country at
the heart of the Immigration and Naturalisation Act.

It's

the essential function of the Immigration and Naturalisation
Act; as it has now been amended in .1965 and as recently as the
last session of Congress, is to facilitate the unification of
families, families of citizens and immigrants, or families
of immigrants.

And this is evidenced in a number of ways.
\

. -•

The immediate relatives of the United States citizen may

be admitted to this country without regard to numerical
limitation.

Although this country has felt it important to

24
placa limits on the numbers of immigrants since 1921 —
QUESTION!

But your argument goes to any legally

present resident alien.
MR. DAVIDSON:

Yes? it goes to any.

But 1 think

it should be recognised that 74 percent of the preferences
in the Immigration and Naturalization Act apply to members of
families, families of citizens, families of resident aliens.
And I think it is also significant because it is
far more than the alien who is injured here.

It is his citizen

wife and his citizen child who is injured when he is deprived
of an equal access to an education which would enable him to

QUESTION;

Does the record- show why your client

does not wish to apply for American citizenship?
MR. DAVIDSON:

No, it does not.,

It simply

contains his statement that he did not wish, when asked

25
by the State, to apply for citizenship at that point.

The

State neither answered nor complained — answered our
affidavit.

It simply accepted those statements contained in

those documents, treated this matter as having really no
disputable issues of fact, and proceeded to move as we did for
summary judgment.
To affirm the judgment below would, not mean that
there would be a massive influx of students to this country
who might obtain the benefits of New York assistance.
Haw York lias a residency requirement.

Non-immigrant students,

a very large group of foreign students who come to study here
annually, are precluded from obtaining New York residencies.
They are precluded by state regulation? in fact, they are
precluded by the Immigration and Naturalization Act.
That Act requires that they have some residence
somewhere else in the world.

And they would be subject to

deportation if they claimed to the Stats of New York that they
were residents of thatstate,
How, the history of this Act, the State act involved,,

In 1969 the State enacted the citizenship requirement

The only indication of legislative

history, legislative policy involved is an estimate by the
staff of the appropriate legislative committee that there might
be fifty students in the state who would be excluded by this
provision, and the sum of $10,000 saved.
That figure, incidentally, disappeared from all
further accountings, and it could very well be that the
State anticipates no savings, because if they're right, if it
functions as ar inducement for people to petition for citizen­
ship, then the net result might be more citizens and no savings
in funds,
X think that requires us to criticize any possible
suggestion that the State of New York might be bankrupted
by a judgment that requires them to treat immigrants and
aitizens alike.

MR. DAVIDSON;

Yes, and if an immigrant is

entitled equally with a citizen to become a doctor, then
our

argument would be that he’s entitled to the oppor­

tunity to become a doctor.
QUESTION:

Well, then, let me add another clause

to the statute, that to secure this grant you must make a
pledge to remain in the practice of medicine in the state of
New York for not less than ten years, and failing to do so,
you would be required to pay one tenth of the total cost of
the grant of the scholarship for each year that you failed

importance which the Immigration and Naturalization Act
places on the unification of these families.

There is a

requirement in the Act that certain categories of immigrants
receive certificates from the Secretary of Labor before they
may be admitted , which would establish that they would
not disadvantage citizen workers, displace them at their
work, force a reduction in wages or working conditions.
The Act. specifically exempts all immediate
relatives, all relatives, in fact, because it is so important
to the Congress of the United States that these people have
an opportunity to reside permanently in this country, to

These are integrated

The federal government has its programs, the

State of New York has its programs.

They are worked together

by rule and regulation to provide a composite.

When the

State of New York says to the student, to an immigrant
student, that he may not receive this assistance, the State
places in extreme jeapordy that person's opportunity for
an education.
Let me conclude this section by indicating that
the objectives of the State of New York which it proclaims
in this suit, that of encouraging people to become citizens,
is an objective which is properly the objective of the
national government.

And this is another aspect of the

State scheme which conflicts with the general national
regulation of immigration.
Mauclet has not excluded the possibility of
becoming a citizen.

He was simply not ready to do so when

the state, in essence, commanded him to do at the cost of
his education.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Greenberg,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP GARY J. GREENBERG, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE RABINOVITCH
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

34
please the Court:
I would like tobegin by focussing on Mr. Justice
Stewart's reference to New York dispensing its largesse to
certain students at institutions of post-secondary education.
We think it can hardly be classified as a gift
when what the New York State legislature is doing is taking
the tax dollars which aliens, of course, contribute equally
with citizens, and determining to dispense them in a particu*

lar program.
Now, we do not ask this Court, and we did not ask
the District Court to substitute its judgment for the
*

judgment of - the New York State legislature.

Let me read to

you that judgment as articulated in 1961 when the program
was really put into high gear, and the tuition assistance
awards first came into being.
The New York State legislature said, higher education
is ho longer a luxury.

It is a necessity for strength,

fulfillment., and survival.
Now the Now York State legislature has determined
\

that this type of program is vital, it is essential to the
'well being of those people who reside in the State.
QUESTION:

Where are you?

MP. - GREENBERG:

That cones fromthe laws of 1961,

Chapter 309, Section 1 (a).
QUESTION:

Is it in the Appendix or in the brief?

35
MR. G'ftEENBURG;

I believe actually that it's

quoted in full in the brief of the State.

And as a further

indication of this statutory purpose? and this is something
that we have quoted in our brief at page 21? in 1969? when the
program was somewhat revised again? Governor Rockefeller in
his memorandum indicated — this is the memorandum of
approval of the bill — that the new revisions would do
much to further New York State’s goal that no young man or
woman with the capacity and desire tc seek a college
education? should be prevented from doing so for lack of
financial resources.

No reference to citizen; simply a

recognition —
QUESTION:

Is that the same legislature that

escc luded a liens?
MR.

GREENBERGj

QUESTION;

That's the same legislature —

Well? how could he talk about all of

them?
MR. GREENBERG;

Kell? I don't really *— we don't

really know why the legislature ever excluded the aliens.
We have no legislative history? and aliens have been
excluded in one fashion or another? but not in a consistent
manner, since approximately 19.17? yet the New York State
legislature has never told us why they have opted to exclude
aliens.

To the extent the legislative history gives any

guide? it is one administrative convenience? and two? the

35
saving of $185,000.,
We think the jurisprudence of this Court makes
it clear that those purposes clearly cannot satisfy New York’s
burden when it invokes this type o£ invidious classification,
QUESTION:

Could the New York legislature give

the resident aliens of this category the right to vote in
Nav7 York elections?

Could they do it under their constitution?

MR, GREENBERG:
they could not do it.

Under the present constitution,

In fact* at one point* 1 think until

1825* New York in fact allowed resident aliens to vote* as
I think virtually every state did at that point in our history.
I think it’s clear that this Court has determined
that New York can exclude resident aliens from voting? it
can exclude them from holding elective office? it can exclude
them from high policymaking offices? and the issue before
this court, maybe in the next case* will b® whether that
includes the State police officer.
QUESTION %

Are there any statistics in the

record that would indicate whether the parents of the
aliens who oapply for this sort of grant are themselves
residents of New York* or rather* residents of the United
States* or to the contrary* residents of some othercountry?
MR, GREENBERG;

There are no such statistics.

The

facts In this case indicate that Mr, Rahinovitch, his entire
family* is resident in New York and has been since 1964,

37
There are no statistics as to — in general.
QUESTION:

Percentages, or anything.

MR. GREENBERG:

No, we do not have that.

And I

don’t know if such statistics are maintained anywhere,
frankly.
The state argues, and perhaps there was some
suggestion that this issue troubled the Court, and I refer
specifically to Justice White’s question, that we really
don't have a discrimination against aliens heras that the
statutory distinction is something different.
The State argues, we’re not discriminating between
citizen and alien; that what this statute does is, it dis­
criminates within the class of aliens.
We think that reasoning, as the District Court
put it, simply defias logic.

Indeed, in preparing for this

argument, I had occasion to look at your decision last
term in Matthew.? versus Lucas.

That involved the social

security dependency allowance to legitimate children, with
certain presumptions as to dependency for legitimates and
certain presumptions within the category of illegitimates„
And apparently the Solicitor General argued this was not a
discrimination l«tween legitimate and illegitimate.

And

in a footnote., footnote 11, this Court says, that’s nonsense.
Just'because you have distinctions within the class of
illegitimates, you cannot argue logically that therefore

38

this is not a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
children*
We have here a statute which, on its face, says
citizens, and those aliens who are willing to apply for
citizenship, will receive a certain benefit.
QUESTION %

Didn’t Matthews versus Diaz

last year

though contain language contrary to that which you just
suggest?

Is it permissible to distinguish within classes

of aliens when the federal government d<?as this?
MR* GREENBERG a

Yes.

When-the federal government

does it, that kind of distinction is permissible.

And

the fourth part of the Matthews opinion makes the very clear
distinction that while it is the normal everyday constitutional,
function of the federal government to distinguish within the
class of aliens and between citizens and aliens, entirely
different considerations are involved when a State makes
that kind of discrimination.
QUESTION:

But then it &aesn?t make any sense to

say that these are really not discrimination, or thatthey really
are discrimination.

What you're really saying is that one

1 ivel of government as the right to make them and the other
doe'.-n’t, not that when one makes the same that the other does,
they are discriminations and that in the other case they are
not.
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, no.

Absolutely*, they are

39

clearly classifications of discrimination.

And what

Matthews holds is that the federal government has the power.
And reading Hampton together with Matthews, at least the
President and the Congress have the power to make such dis­
crimination.

What Matthews I think quits clearly holds, in

the fourth part of the opinion, is that the state governments
do not have the similar power, unless — and I have heard
very little today about the unless part

unless the

discrimination satisfies some legitimate and substantial
state interests,
We look to see what the state interest is in
this particular statutory classification.

And frankly, the

argument put forward by the state we think is nothing but a
convenient, but false, post hoc rationalization.

The State

tells us that they’re seeking to encourage, in essence, voter
registration and office holding.
Now, how does a statute which simply provides
tuition assistance, Regents’ scholarships or student loans
encourage voter registration or office holding?
Indeed, when confronted with this particular statu✓
fcory purpose the District Court said, not only can't the
State

satisfy it’s substantial interest here? there isn't

ever-' a rational relationship between this asserted purpose
and the statute under consideration.
We search at length to seek a method by which this

40

statute would somehow further these goals»
And indeed it is interesting to note * as the
»

brief from Mauclet points out in detail, New York has a
variety — a whole host of these habitual reflexive
discriminations against aliens.

And they're in Court on

many of these cases right now.
In everyone of these cases, the same rationalization
is used.

We are told that requiring citizenship for the

licensing of physicians promotes the New York political
community.

The State argued, believe it or not, thatthe

same political community rationalejustified their requirement
that physical therapists becitissens of the United States.
It is a ubiquitous argument trotted out on every
occasion by the New York Attorney General, presumably seeking
to find support in

the Sugarman caveat as to what would

be a substantial state interest.
In this particular case, we don't see how the
statute even approaches anything which we could consider to
be a substantial interest.

We don't see how the statute is

narrowly and precisely drawn to promote the interest.

In­

deed, we think it's clear, and we think legislative memorandum
number eight, focusing on the $10,000 saving, we think its
clear that what New York was doing was out of habit, focusing
on a traditionally discriminated class, and seeking to save
a few dollars' a h their expense* and doing it in a situation

41

where the Hew York legislature has already determined the
significance and importance of this program to the individual.
How, the fact that total foreclosure is not the
consequence of this program should make, we think, no dif­
ference .
QUESTION:

That is, you mean, the fact that some

aliens are eligible?
MR. GREENBERG:

The fact that some aliens are eligible

the fact that aliens can go to universities if they can
fund the particular

costs themselves without anv student

assistance.
That the —
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose there is student assist­

ance

there generally is —- at institutions of higher learning

today.

The students don't pay the full costs.
MR. GREENBERG::
QUESTION:

Oh —

I mean, even though thev pay the full

fee, that’s not the full cost.
MR. GREENBERG s
QUESTION:

Oh, absolutely.

It's generally about fifty, sixty

percent of it at the most.
MR. GREENBERG;

That's right.

But in the case,

for example, of Mr. Rabinovitch, he now has a SO00 — I
'rears $02'5 annual tuition cost.

If he were a citizen —• and

in his case, he'd have to do more than declare intention?

42
he would actually have to apply to be eligible — he would
get, via the Regents' scholarship, which he won on a
competitive examination, and via tuition assistance, that
full amount covered.
In his economic circumstances, this imposes an
enormous burden on him and his family, because he gets no
assistance, none whatsoever.
wow I should like to make two additional points
before closing.

With reference to the loan program, the

State made some reference to a requirement or a request
for a remand.
I frankly don't understand what they are talking
about.

The State had a full opportunity to try this case

below.

The State moved for summary judgment.

The State

didn't seek to introduce any additional evidence.

The

considerations of the loan program are, quite frankly,
exactly the same.
QUESTION:

Did your client ask for a loan?

MR. GREENBERG:

My client indicated that the --

ho might/ for purposes of graduate school, require a loan.
He has never actually applied for a loan —QUESTION:

Well, how does he have standing to

raise the loan question?
HR. GREENBERG:

Well, we think because we have a

single statutory prescription; that is to sav, 6613 covers

43
all three programs.

Because he has been injured in

connection with two of the programs.

Because the State

has admitted, and admitted in the argument below, and it's
reflected in the opinion, that if he applies for a loan, he
will automatically be denied assistance.
QUESTION:

His standing, then, is based on how the

codifiers number the sections of the statutes?
MR. GREENBERG:
simply on the numbering.
program here.

Nell, I don't think it's based
But v;e do have a single, statutory

And it would make very little sense to require

Rabinovitch to go back, file his application, have it
denied, and come right back up on issues that would be
virtually identical.
So we see that there's no — remand in this case
can serve no purpose.

And indeed, the State has never asked

for it, or sought to introduce any csvidence, or deal with
the loan program in any way differently until this moment.
Finally we would point to the supremacy —
QUESTION:

Except I thought the state had always

taken the position that you — your client does not have
standing to raise the loan —
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, the standing point they have

raised from the beginning.
That's what I thought.

QUESTION:
«

MR. GREENBERG:

Finally, with regard to the

44
supremacy argument, I think it is very important to recocmize
that the United States Government has allowed the appellees
in this case to enter and reside infche United States.

And

they've done so, without req^lirin^r any declaration of intention
to become a citizen at any time.
Second of all, there is a statutory provision,
42 U.S.C. 1981, which this Court has relied upon in
Takahashi and Graham, which indicates that resident aliens
have a right to enter to abide within all of the United
States, and in equality of legal privilege and right'; and
that when Mew York enacts this program, it is clearly
interfering with the general plan and program articulated
by the federal government in the Immigration and Nationality
Act.
Indeed —- I'm sorry, I see mv time is up,,
HR. CHIRP JUSTICE BURGER:

You may finish your

sentence.
MR. GREENBERG:

All right.

Indeed, the enactment

of the parole-refugee provision is simply New York's
recognition that by keeping out of the program people whom
the federal government has allowed into the United States, they
are burdening the residence of these people, and they are
imposing upon them burdens not contemplated when the
federal government allowed them entry and residence in this
country.

Thank you.

45

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Greenberg.

Do you have anything further, Mrs. Gordon?
MRS. GORDON:

Yes, your Honor.

I have a few

minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JUDITH A. GORDON, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MRS. GORDON: ’’The future progress of the state
and nation, cind the general welfare of the people, depend
upon the individual development of the maximum number of
citizen leaders to provide a broad range of leadership.
"It is in the vital interests of the people of
t his State to develop this reservoir of talent and future
leadership."
That

is a quotation from the same legislative

history that Mr. Greenberg quoted a few moments ago.

It

appears in part at pages 12 and 13 of our brief, and it
appeals in the main volume of

McKinney's;

, the pertinent

education law sections, where it is set forth in full.
Sc much for post hoc rationalization.

And indeed,

however, if the State were to infer any purpose from the
face of a given statute absent any prior legislative history,
there would be absolutely nothing wrong with that imprint
under a strict scrutiny standard or under a reasonable
relationship standard.
Now, the citizenship and national affinity

46

requirements with respect to the program s in issue have
a 57 year histox*y in the State of New York.

They were

started in 1920 when the Regents — with respect to
Regents' scholarships.

They were expanded gradually throughout,

the years, until they reached substantially their present
form in 1962.

And indeed, as you can see, the programs

themselves were expanded, loans coming shortly after
Regents' scholarships in 1957, and scholar-incentive
awards coming shortly after that in 1961.
Now, appellees refer you -- both appellees
refer

you — to a figure, $10,000 and 50 students.

They

come to that figure by starting their- legislative research
inl961 with the birth of the scholar incentive program,
putting aside the 40 years of customary history that attach
to the Regents' scholarship program.
Now, appellees say — and there is a difficulty
here, but it is easily resolved ---

At the birth of the

scholar-incentive program, that bill was in the same
package of bills; they occasioned revisions to the Regents'
scholarship program.
One of the revisions of the Regents’ scholarship
program was a reference to the Board of Regents to
e Establish an appropriate rule regarding citizenship and
affinity for Regents’ scholarships.
Accordingly, the scholar-incentive program, as I

47
indicated, was enacted at exactly the same time, they
didn’t have a rule.

But the legislative history that I

just read you was enacted with respect to that program.
Appellants have submitted that it was the purpose of
the legislature at that point, to have the Regents make a
rule for both programs.
Appellee Mauclet comes in, and he says, no;
impossible.

The Board of Regents didn’t have the power.

They only had the power to make rales with respect to
Regents’ scholarships, not with respect to scholarincentive .
The answer to that question is quite simple; the
power is found in Section 603 of the Education Law as it
appears in the main volume of McKinney's, which was in fact
added to include Board of Regents’ power over scholarship
incentives in 1961 when that program was created.
how the $10,000.

As it turned out, over the period

of time when scholar-incentives were first enforced, and
this reference to the Board of Regents was first enforced,
the Board of Regents in fact made a rule for Regents’ scholar­
ships; it did not in fact make a rule for scholar-incentive.
As a result, in 1969, the legislature in its
essence adopted the Board of Regents rules for scholarships,
and codified-them into statutes for both programs.
Now, in that re-enactment in effect of this rule,

48
there are two legislative documents that the appellees
refer to.
The first is report 8, which started at the
beginning, apparently, at the beginning of the 1868 legis­
lative session.

It says, in effect, we want to put the

citizenship requirement back.

And there is an indication

inthat bill that the savings will be $10,000.

There was

also an indication in that bill that other items would have
certain savings, and there was also an indication in every
New York State bill about what the fiscal ramifications of
a given piece of legislation are.
Notably, the very next report, and indeed the one
before the legislature apparently enacted report $,
deletes the reference to $10,000 and 50 students.
does it do that?

Why

I think because it was an obviously gross

error.
The question of where the $10,000 figure came
from, and the question of where 50 students came from .is
never explained.

And indeed, there is, as appellees

themselves indicate in this immediately following report,
the reference itself was deleted.
According, I c.on't think we can infer anything from
that.

What we can infer is that this particular — that

Section 661 in its present form is a matter of customary
history in the State of New York over a very substantial period!

49

of time.
Now, I would just like to take a few moments with
respect to a point raised by Justice Rehnquist.
that Section 661(3} now regulates three programs.

It is true
It is

equally true that thefee three programs are separate, and
they are found in different portions of the statutes,
and they have different types of criteria incident to them.
The one appellant's position with respect to
Rabinovitch's standing here: it's not a mere formality that
he didn’t obtain a final adjudication or final administrative
determination of his rights, although I certainly think that
would be sufficient in itself, the point is, he never alleged
a present need for the loan.

And there is absolutely no

e vidence in the record that he would have a deficiency
between his anticipated expenses and his income that would
warrant a loan.
/

He says, in his brief in response here, that, well,
he wouldn't ask for an interest free loan, which is one of the
subsidies* provided by the program.

Of course the additional

subsidy provided by this program —
QUESTION:

Does the application for a loan have

a blank to say whether you're a citizen or not?
HRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:
filing it?

Yes, it does, your Honor.

Well, what would be the sense of him

50

HRS. GORDONS

Well, first of all, he didn’t file

it, and we don’t — first of all —
QUESTION:

What would be the sense?

HRS. GORDON;

In reality, your Donor, the loan

application usually qoes first to the Rank.

The lender,

under this proqram, is not the State of New York, or the
New York State hiqher education services corporation , but a
bank.

And it goes to a bank for the obvious purpose that all

2. oan applications go toa bank, to see if the individual
who wants to borrow the money needs the money.
Now, granted, there is a provision about citizenship.
But we don’t know how this application would have been disposed
of, and we certainly don't know whether he needs the
money within any defintiion of the word —
QUESTIONS

Well, don’t I assume that if a New York

official paid money to a non-resident alien who said ha didn’t
ever intend to ba an alien would be proper?
MRS. GORDON:

You mean if he paid it out in

violation of the statute?
QUESTION:

Could he do that?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Obviously not, your Honor.

Well, why should he have to go through

that, when there’s no way hacould get it?
MRS. GORDON:

Your Honor, the same New York official

who, in fact, as I just pointed out, does not pay out the

51
money, would be equally in violation of law, or certainly
*

be exercising extraordinarily poor judgment if he paid
out the money to somebody who didn't need it.

I mean,

need, that's the whole point, your Honor.
B'irst of all, the claim is premature, and its
effect is speculative.
I would just like to close -- well, it appears
1 have closed„
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Well, can I ask you before you close?

MRS. GORDON %
QUESTION:

Certainly.

What’s your understanding on the

power of New York to impose a residency requirement for
the disbursement of these funds?
MRS. GORDON:

I think that New York has that

unquestioned power under the Graham decision.
QUESTION:

And what's your understanding of the

State's power to impose, say, a one year's residency
re quiremenfc?
MRS. GORDON:

I think it has that power, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And New York apparently thinks that is

not sufficient?
MRS. GORDON:

Your Honor, the statute asks

x--:actly the same commitment from citizens and aliens: a

52

commitment to the United States is possessed by any
United States citizen by virtue of his status.
QUESTION:

So your answer is, no, New 'York does

not think that’s adequate? is that right?
MRS. GORDON:

The answer is, no, New York does
■7

not think that5s adequate, that the citizen and the alien
both are treated identically under the statute, and that
the result is a benign classification.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:39 o’clock, p„m„, the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.}
