ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. MOORE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MOORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case involves questions regarding the
constitutionality of two Virginia statutes under which the
State of Virginia licenses corporations for the taking
of fish in its territorial waters.
The statutes are set out in the Appendix beginning
at page 114.

The first of these statutes is Virginia

Code section 28.1-60,

I'll refer to that as Section 50,

or the residency law.
By this statute Virginia regulates one of its
/

fisheries, the Chesapeake Bay menhaden fishery.

So that

this statute is limited to one fishery and one body of
water, an inland sea, Chesapeake Bay.
3y virtue of this statute foreign -- excuse me,
non-resident corporations are inelegible for licenses
for the taking of menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay fisheries.
They are eligible for the taking of menhaden in the

A

Atlantic Coastal vmters of Virginia within the throe
mile territorial son.
The appellees in this case, Reaooast. Products,
Incorporated , and its two subsidiaries, The 'lew Pmith ’leal
Company and second Oceanic Corporation, are corporations
located and having their principal places of business in
Hew Jersey and 'Tew York, and they're not, under the
Virginia statute, resident corporations.

fishery.

two statutes is found at

This is ^itle 2R.1 of the Code
For ease of discussion, TM

like to refer to that as-Section 81.
Bv this statute Virginia provides that all of
its fisheries . - - that foreign-control led corporations
shall be ineligible for licenses for any of viroinia's
fisheries.

The» test of foreign control considers

various

factors including the President and Chief executive
officer or other chief executive officer and noard of
Directors chairman.

nlso, the percentage of stockholding

bv United rfates citizens.
In essence, it requires that the control in the
corporation through stockholders be in the hands of
United states citizens.

The lower Court , upon request of the nonelines,
held that these statutes violated certain constitutional
provisions,

^’he lower court held first of all that the

bav menhaden residency lav? violated the eoual protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and thereby restrained
further enforcement of this Act.
mhe lower court held that Faction HI, whj.c*'
bars foreion controlled corporations from taking fish in
Virginia, was preemoted by force of a federal act,the
Bartlett Act.

Vofr this statute is set out at page 110

of the Annendix.
I'll first turn to the question of preemntion.
And we would submit, of course, that the lower court's
holding to the effect that Section 81 barring foreign
controlled corporations in Virginia's fisheries, is not.

by the Bartlett Act or any other

federal enactment.
The lower court held, of course

But the Bartlett Act, it's clear, applies only
to United States vessels -— excuse me, applies only to
foreign flag vessels.

These — this act bars foreign

flag vessels from fishing within 12 miles of the United

f,

State Coast under current law.
Under the new provisions of the extended n.s.
fishery gone, foreign flaa vessels will be barred from
fishimr with two hundred miles of the United States coast.
Tn anv event, the federal act clearlv applies
only to foreign flag vessels.

The Virginia acts here

clearlv apply to United States flag, domestic fishing
vessels, albeit operated by foreign controlled corporations.
The waters affected are Virginia’s waters, and therefore
the two statutes cannot possibly, as a practical matter,
conflict„
The United States, in its brief, has agreed with
our position on that, and we take special note of that,
because the United states, of course, is responsible
for enforcement of the Bartlett Act.

OURSTION:

MR. MOOREi

For purnoses of the Bartlett Act,

the Uniter? states position would perhaps

be that they are

U.S. vessels, the onesoperated bv Reacoast in this case.
QUESTIOU:

Yes.

•J

MR. MOORE:

For purposes of Virginia fishery

regulation, which we contend is not reached by the
documentation laws, they are, in effect, foreign vessels.
Because foreign control is in fact involved.
QUESTION:

Well, if the United States looked

at these ships as foreign vessels, the same as Virginia
does, then the Bartlett Act would apply.
MR. MOORE:QUESTION:

That would be correct.
Bo then the ^ircrinia law might be

in some trouble then?
MR. MOORE:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Bo the United Btates and Virginia

have diametrically opposing views as to whether these ships
are foreign vessels or not?
MR. MOORE;

No, your honor, I don’t think that's

a correct •—
QUESTION:
MR. MOORE:

N’ell, you say they’re foreign vessels.
Me say they are U.S, flag vessels

operated by foreign controlled corporations.

And that

there are reasons to believe —- very strong reasons —
that foreign controlled corporations can operate a
United Btates flag vessel and deplete fisheries in the same

manner that

foreign flag vessels have in fact depleted

our fisheries.
And that is the rationale which underlies
Virginia’s view of the foreign control being the decisive
factor in whether or not they should be allowed entry
to state fisheries.
QUESTIO*!:

Well, you're pitching it then on

ultimate control rather than documentation.
MR. MOORE:

That's correct, your honor.

Our

position is that the documentation laws do not take into
account fishery preservation.
and therefore,

They are for other purposes,

these statutes would in no wav conflict

with federal law, but in fact would supplement — provide
protection to Virginia*3 fisheries which is not provided
by federal law at the present time.
You stated that we think the Bartlett Act itself
has no preemptive effect.

And further, the Eeacoast and

the United States have asserted certain theories of
preemption under the documentation laws.

And as I've just

stated, our position is that the documentation laws
have never been construed bv this Court to affect fishina
in state waters.
There's a series of cases beginning with the
case of Smith v. Maryland, an In’S5 case, followed by
Manchester v. Massachusetts

In those two cases, federal

vessel licensees claimed that their federallicense of a
%

fishing vessel exempted them from state fisheries laws.
And in both cases, the Supreme Court said, fishing laws
of the states are not affected, limited or preempted by
force of the federal documentation of a vessel.
QUESTION:

Does the Virginia statute place

any limitation on the disposal of the catch?
HR. MOORE:
QUESTION:
MR. MO0RE:

No, it does not.
They can sell them anwav they want?
That's correct.

They can be shipped

wherever they want, processed wherever they'd like.

this Court has said the act of taking fish is a localized
activity not involved in the stream or flow of commerce.
That position clarifies the effect of the federal
documentation laws.

And in fact, these laws, passed under

the commerce power of the Congress, cannot reach the taking
of fish in state waters.

It could in the coastal zone in

which the federal government has exclusive authority over
fisheries, between the — the area between 3 miles and
200 mile??, effective March 1, or 3 to 12 miles under
present law.

Yes, it could very well, because the

federal government has exclusive fisheries control in
that area.
Our position would be, at best, there is a
concurrent requirement of state and federal licenses,
and that federal licenses have . never been preempted
within their state waters

QUESTIO?!:

You say state waters, vou mean a

MR. MOORE:

Do you suppose that after the Tidelands

Act, the Submerged. Lands Act, Congress could come aloncr and
say, we're exercising our exclusive jurisdiction to

MR. MOORE:

I don't think they could, yourhonor.

In the Submerged Lands Act the United States confirmed
the state’s ownership of all mineral resources, fisheries,
shell fish within 3 miles of the United

States coast and

in their inland, waters.

An alternative theory of preemption has been
offered, that the fact that Seacoast vessels, which thev
purchased from an American controlled corporation, the

fact that this transfer or sale was approved by the
United states under a procedure of the C'hippina Act,
Sections 9 and 17, that this in fact preempts the right
of Virginia under Section Hi to bar Seacoast as a foreign
controlled corporation.
It's clear from several sources that these
acts, the Chippina Act, Sections 9 and 17, have, as their
sole purpose, control of the sale of vessels to foreign
interests for the nurpose of national defense and securitv.
Counsel for the ^taritime Administration in
recent hearings looking into foreign investment in
American fisheries, has confirmed this,

we've referred to

it in our reply brief at page 11, footnote 1.

In that

case — in that instance, he indicated that the sole
purpose of these statutes is .national defense, certainly
not to preempt the right of the states to license the
taking of fish within their borders.
rTe would submit therefore that no federal enactment

or even purports to
license fisheries.

preempt the right of the states to
If that be the case, the remaining

ouestion is whether or not the two statutes under
consideration here license fishing in Virginia's waters
under constitutional ~~ consistent with constitutional
principles.

16

And v?e submit that both statutes do.

"’he first

statute, Section 81, is clearly a conservation of fisheries
statute.

The depletion of United States fishery stocks

by foreign fishing interests is well documented.

The

findings of Congress in passage of the new federal act,
Public Law 94-265, known as the Fisheries Conservation
and Management Act,

the findings of Congress in that

case document the fact that foreign fishing interests,
because of their self interest in economic gain, have
depleted our fisheries in nearly every instance where
thav’ve been allowed to fish either outside the 12 mile
limit or inside the 12 mile limit under permit and
international agreement.
In those cases, they have violated agreements,
made enforcement impractical, and in fact, this is the
factor which has led the way in extending United States
fishery zones out to 200 miles.
The Virginia law is premised upon the same finding.
Virginia has suffered at the hands of foreign fishing.

The

entire river herring industryin Virginia was destroyed,
virtuallv, in a period of two to three years of foreign
fishing, scooping up the fish as they exited Virginia's
waters to spawn, and depleting entirely the stock.
"he Virginia law saw the advent of the new 200
mile law, and recognized that there would be a great attempt

17
by foreign fishing interests to avoid the new ?.00rdle
federal law by operating United states flaw'vessels.

The

federal law simply orovid.es that foreign flag 'vessels
may not enter beyond the line of 2nn niles.

hut it does

not in anv way protect the states from foreign fishing
interests who would set up shell corporations in anv of
the states, including Virginia, and therebv be eligible
under federal law to license their vessels as domestic
United States vessels — the same situation thatpertains
with Seaeoast — and fish with impunitv in Virginia waters.
The evil has been established here, that the
foreign fishing practices do deplete fisheries.

And in

fact Virginia law merely supplements federal law in seeking
to protect its waters from possible dangers —-and in fact
very probable dangers — of foreign investment in U.g.
vessels setting up shell corporations to meet anv residency
requirements of the state, and to complete an utter
destruction of our fisheries.
Seaeoast has attempted, to show this lav; as directed
against them alone.

Put in fact this law applies to all

of Virginia's fishing industrv,

all fisheries.

And

foreign controlled co-oorations are barred from all
fishing in Virginia, not simply the menhaden' i^nstry, in
which Seaeoast has in fact been engaged.

18

And furthermore, Seacoast has presented no real
competitive factor in the past, as we've outlined in our
brief.

Pages 36 and 37 of the Appendix Indicate that

Seacoast has done little or no fishing in recent years
in Virginia.

So it’s very difficult to attach the

motive of elimination of competition to this statute.
It's clearly premised on the same findings and conservation
purposes

as the federal act.
And we submit that in that light it clearly meets

the constitutional standards of the Fourteenth Amendment,
consistent with the holdings of McGowan v. Maryland, and a
series of other cases.
Turning now to the Virginia residency law, 1
would note

first that if the application of Virginia's

foreign control corporation law, barring the taking of
fish in Virginia waters by foreign controlled corporations,
Section 81, if that statute is upheld in this case as
applied to seacoast, there is no need to reach the question
of the validity of the second statute, about which I am
ready to speak.
Section 60 would bar non-resident corporations in
Virginia's Chesapeake Bay.
limited in effect.

It’s proscription is much more

This statute applies to an industry

which it may be helpful if we discuss something about the
menhaden, industry with this statute in perspective.

19
Menhaden enter the coastal waters of the United
States in the early spring, and begin migrating up the
Atlantic Coast spawning in their migration.

The newly

spawned fingerlings enter Coastal waters, primarily the
Chesapeake Bay and other large embayments, with estuaries
which lead off, as protective nurseries for these fish.
The Virginia residency requirement, under Section
60, does not apply to the three mile Atlantic coastal
menhaden fishery.

And therefore there’s no impediment to

the migration of menhaden.

Furthermore, the Virginia

season on the taking of menhaden on the Chesapeake Bay
does not in any way interfere with the migration of mature
menhaden out of the Bay during the winter months, the early
winter months and late fall.
When the fishing is done in Virginia, in the Bay
by residents, it is on a. relatively stable population of
fish.

The young fish are those that populate the Bay, and

it's a rather fragile resource because they are two
year old and less fish.

The more mature fish migrate up

and down the coastal waters in the more northern sections
before returning and migrating south for the winter.
With that in mind, the Virginia statute is
limited to the Chesapeake Bay, an inland body of water, and
it simply provides that residents only, in terms of corporate
residence, may take these fish.

T'Te submit that this statute is consistent with
the holdino in flcC ready v. Virginia by this Court holding
that the oxmership of the inland waters and their natural
resources suonorts the rights of the states to reserve
those resources for its residents.
There is no reason, as a practical matter, to
aoolv a different rule in this case with regard.to menhaden.
OPFPTIOTT t

Mr. Moore, is there anvthing in the

record to indicate that Mi.roin in does reserve the menhaden
for Virginia residents?

Can't a resident, after he took

a catch, ship the menhaden to TTew vork or somenlace like
that?
MR. "tOOPP :

Vos, he may.

vn\ir honor, this statute

only reserves the privilege of taking to residents.

AMd

we submit that that is one of the factors which dear.lv
indicates that it’s a limited statute, and it's not intended
to in any wav infringe upon commerce.
OUFPCihu •

MOUid it be any different if it were

reserving the privilege of hdina an architect, say, to
residents?

Or a,privilege of mining coal or anvthing else?
MR. Monnm.
https"top

:

x think it is, vour honor.
T7haf's the d i^^erence?

MR. MOORF: There's a verv undone situation t/ith
regard to fisheries as a natural resource.

Many natural

resources, in fact, most natural resources, in order to take

21
them, a firm must in fact establish some commitment and
connection with the community, establish some economic
benefit for the community in terms of employment to mine
ore or take clay or sand or gravel -- requires in fact some
employment generated from the local community.
With fisheries, fisheries can be subject to the
reaping and harvesting by out of state vessels with out
of state crews with virtually no return for the re source
to the state, and the complete depletion, in fact, if
enough non-resident fishing is don®, so that Virginia, in
fact, economically would receive no benefit from a resource
which the Submerged Lands Act —*
QUESTION;

Your p-arposa then is not to preserve

in our brief the reason for that indicating that it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. LOFLIN, JR, , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LOFLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the Appellee and its subsidiaries,
Seacoast Products and the two other subsidiary corporations
which, as the Court may know, are domestic corporations,
controlled ultimately by a corporation of the United
Kingdom, which is itself publicly held.
Now, much was made in the reply briefs here that
because control of Seacoast does unquestionably rest in
i

.....

the hands of a foreign corporation owned by foreigners
at least-in large part, that somehow that arrangement alone
deprived us of any claim for equal protection of the laws.
I think the claim is spurious, but I would like
to note for the Court that, as stated in our brief, Hanson
Trust is a publicly held corporation, and in fact some
U.S. citizens own its stock,

I do not suggest that they ~

that there are enough U.3. citizens to meet the test -just
outlined by mv friend as stated in the Virginia statutes.
I'm not here contending me have 75 per cent in the
hands of Americans.

But I just wanted the Court to know

that if this is an issue, there are some Americans who have
invested in this company whose rights and economic benefits
would be affec ted by anv detriment to Beacoast and, in turn,
its parent eomnany.
OTJEB^TO’I•

Does it make anv difference to vour

case, Mr. Loflin, if there were no American stockholders?
MR. LOFLIN:

I think not one bit, vour honor.

T

think under the basis on which corporations are permitted
to function in the states, and are under — in this case
are under in certain aspects -— verv tiohtlv controlled
aspects of federal law, it would be most improper and
baseless to sav, well, we have one kind of corporation
which has certain benefits and privileges under the n.n.

T>Tith that background, I think vou can better

in the Virginia legislature when the two Virginia based

saw that there was an opportunity, because of the change

legislature to put through a restrictive statiite.

was put throucrh.
QUESTION:

Mr. Loflin, does the record show how

in Virginia waters.

MR. I/VPLITTE:

— perhaps T was misunderstood.

As

to the Chesapeake only, that aspect of it has for manv,
many years, T think since the latter part of the l^th
century, been restricted to Virginia residents.

Tn order

to fish in the Chesapeake, and we did fish in the Chesapeake
for a time, we had to set up a vircrinia resident corporation,
which we did.

And we had a nlant in viroinia at one time.

But at. all the time that T’n talking about,
which goes back tor manv, manv years, the vessels of
ceacoast wandered as the menhaden do, from state to state,

in the offshore waters, but within the 3 mile limit.
It is in the nature of menhaden to come into
these inshore waters in the Spring and summer,
generally come into the more southern states first, and
gradually migrate toward the North, up towards rape Cod.
It is their characteristic— and this makes
the fishery commercially viable — it is their characteristic
to school up in massive schools onlv in these summer
migratory paths, and only in inshore waters.

Practically

all of the menhaden that is captured for commercial purposes
is taken in close to shore.
Now that takes care of the outlying shore areas,
but there are important 5.nterior bays and river estuaries.
For example, we’ve mentioned the Chesapeake.
Delaware River is important.

Nut the

No is Long Island Pound.

So is Narragansett Bay, and the waters around Cape Cod.
These are all waters where the menhaden move on their
travels.

It is their nature to spawn in the open ocean,

drift in toward shore when they are very tiny, almost little
particles, an d then grow in the estuarine waters of Virginia
North Carolina. Delaware, the other shore states.

And the record shows that one and two year menhaden are
characteristic of the fish caught in that area.

And they’re about

size, aren't they?
MR. LOFLIN:

That would be about right.

fish to the three year old's range, because that's when the
females spawn for the first time.

MR. LOFLIN:

The Smith Meal Company was one of

the names used in New Jersey.
QUESTION:
MR. LOFLIN:

That's the name I knew it by.
Nell, I think it was known by that

name at one time in Virginia also.

Rut Smith Meal is

probably the name that probably the older residents of
the Fort Monmouth area would associate with.

But Seacoast

is the parent corporation of Smith Meal and Oceanic.
This company has been described in the same
company as foreign predators somehow ravaging the fishery
and then disappearing to go ravage some other fishery.
Characteristics attributed to us seem rather
strange and I think totally inappropriate.

in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Texas, Louisiana.

And

our competitors, as noted in the brief, are similarly
situated.

Ne’re located where the fish are; there's

no question about: that.

And we all know that this business,

thich is basically a very sound business, x^ill be absolutely
ruined if enough fish are not left to replenish the
supply and keep it regular.
There is not one word in the record, and for
that matter in the brief, characterizes the menhaden as
an endangered species.

We're characterized as a predator

now owned

by a British parent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Loflin, could T interrupt to get

one historical matter straight in my mind?
As I understand it, the non-resident statute
has been on the books for some time,
MR. LOFLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Thafcis one of the two statutes that

prevents you from fishine? both in Chesapeake Bay and on
the inland — within the 3 mile — on the ocean?
MR. LOFLIN;

The resident statute, strictly

speaking, just applies to the Chesapeake Bay.
QUESTION:

Oh, the resident statute has no

application to waters — to the ocean waters?
MR. LOFLIN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
That answers my question.

HR. LOFLIN:

The other statute, the alien or

citizenship statute, applies to Virginia waters wherever.
In other words, the ocean and the Chesapeake Bay.

The

residency statute, which goes back, I believe, to the
1890s, just applies to the Bay.

The only way we could

comply with that statute historically was to set up a
resident Virginia corporation which we did at one point.
QUESTION;

The language of the statute is, the

waters of the Commonwealth or the waters under its joint
jurisdiction.

And 1' thought that perhaps included the

ocean waters.

But you say it does not.

QUESTION:

And the fact that the non-citizen

the citizenship requirement affects the marginal waters,
that's xdiy you were suddenly — your business situation

MR. LOFLIN:

this, because that meant x»?e were out of Virginia entirely.
Without a resident Virginia subsidiary, we were already
out of the Chesapeake Ray fishery at that particular
point.

Well, the — I think

it's fair to say as far as our thinking on the matter is
xtfhen we found that Virginia had, in our view, suddenly
adopted emergency legislation "which only applied to us,
we thought that we should try to straighten out both

privileges.

We think we should have

We should come down from New Jersey,

fish the coastal waters of Virginia or the inland waters —
by that I mean the Bay.

And then take the catch back to

our processing plant in Fort Kcinmouth, New Jersey.
This is the pattern that characterizes the industry.
The menhaden pay very little attention to state borders.
They just migrate as the mood takes them.

And the

fishermen want to be where the fish are, quite obviously.
And you can’t, for economic reasons, have a plant every
few miles up and down the coast.

It involves quite a

bit of investment.
If I could turn for just a moment to the foreign
policy point here.

It x^ould not come as a

surprise

to anyone here that the United States has been a great
advocate of free trade historically.

We like to be free

to make American investments in foreign countries.
the quid pro cmo is, we invite foreion countries and
their citizens to invest in the United states,

when

And

M
a hill at the federal level was introduced that would have
had the same effect nationally as the Virginia billhas in
its state, which would have, in effect, put Seacoast
entirely out of business in the Menhaden trade, the
State Department came in, the Treasury Department came in,
and they criticized the bill.

The pointed out it was

inconsistent with the federal government's position on
free movement of investment.

And that bill died.

It was after that bill died that our competitors,
Zapata-Haynie, went into the Virginia legislature, and
suceeded in Richmond where they had failed in Washington.
Nov; it has been pointed oxrt in our brief that
there was a hearing — a hearing significant I submit
despite the kind of casual brushing of it away in our
opponent's

reply brief —• there was a hearing under the

auspices of the Federal Maritime Administration, conducted
actually by NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

The factors that we were told were going

to be considered for our enrollment and licensing in the
menhaden fishery included such matters as the conservation
of the resource, the

employment of U.S. citizens, the

effect on competition, and other social and economic factors
in the United States.
Nov; there was a hearing, and our competitors
came in and tried to oppose the issuance of our license.

NOAA heard the evidence.

They satisfied themselves, I

think it's fair to say, that

we were not here as a predator

At the point where we adjourned for lunch, I

here.

And that of course was critical

Upon the transfer of the control of these

corporations to the UK corporation, Hanson Trust, it was
necessary to go into this enrollment and licensing procedure.
QUESTION:

Mr. Loflin, do both enrollment and

39

licensing come up under the same statute?
MR. LOFLIN:

Yes, basically that's the same

statute.
OUESTION:

That's the 1793 Act?

MR. LOFLIN:

I'm not sure that they're both

under that same section?
QUESTION;

The old one?

MR. LOFLIN;

Yes, that's right.

The enrollment aspect as distinguished from the
licensing aspect is for the purpose of determining the
American character of these vessels; now these ships are
going to be plying in navigation up and down the coast,
and they're going to be fishing up and down the coast in
any one of a number of states.
To determine the American character of the vessel
there are statutory requirements that the corporate form
must involve a domestic corporation.

'T'hey have

And our 68 vessels were transferred

and \>?ere permitted to be enrolled in the American fishery.
As a matter of fact, although this isn't in the
statute, we have approximately 450, 500 employees who
work in our plants, and ^5 per cent of them are American
citizens as well.
QUESTION:

Well, no one's contending you didn't

comply with the federal statute, are they?
MR. LOFLIN:

I go into it only to try and lay a

foundation for claims I will later make as to the consequences
that flow from complying

with the statutes.

I would like

simply to outline the steps, and then T will try to persuade
the court, show the Court, what

consequences flow from

/

this process.
QUESTION:

It’s your half hour.

MR. LOFLIN:

We're into the enrollment phase, and

let's say it’s been determined that we are permitted to
fly the American flag.
Next is licensing: and this is critical, because
if a license is just a number that goes on the bow of a
vessel, or a piece of paper that says, you are the Mary Jo,
that would not be enough.

We have Gibbons and Ogden in

the absolute parallel language explaining what a license

41

is.

It’s a license to do something, not just to tell

a passing Maritime patrol boat who you are.
In Gibbons and Ogden, the boat was licensed, to
ply the coastal trade.

In our case, we are licensed to

engage in the fisheries.
In the briefs submitted amicus by the —

Incidentally, is menhaden a form of

all.

And that's

So you, for this purpose, are put in one of the

other of those categories.

And simply for administrative

purposes, the menhaden is treated as part of the mackerel,
fishery.

But I think biologically, as far as I know, there

isn't any connection, or if so, not a close one.

But we

are registered in the mackerel fishery, because that’s the
statutory format, their not being whales or cod, I guess.
F>ut what does a license do?

In the brief

submitted by the solicitor general's office in the Appendix,,
at 3A, theyset forth the license.

And it among other things

states the following: license is hereby granted for the
said vessel to be employed in carrying on the mackerel
fishery for one year from the date hereof, and no longer.
The license must be renewed annually.

QUESTION:

t

MR. LOFLIN:

Well, I assume such a statute wouldn't

be in conflictwith that or might be in conflict with it.
Absent a new statute, I think that part of that law was
triggered by some problems with oil rising out of the
California cases.

And evidently it was — well, I won’t

does entitle us, to fish in offshore waters beyond the
state territorial limit,
QUESTION:

Suppose the state of -- the Commonwealth

of Virginia passed a law that there shall be no fishing
for this type of fish in the Chesapeake Bay by anybody.
MR. LOFLIN:

As to that, I think we would have

to be bound by that, as well.
QUESTION:

Let me explain what I mean -~

It's not an absolute right.

It's a

right subject to others.
MR. LOFLIN:

It is a right subject to certain

police controls exerted by the state in the name, perhaps,
of conservation or health or what have you.

When I say

wa have a right to go into the state and fish, I really
mean we have the right not to be discriminated against

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. MOORE , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MOORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First point we would like to address is the
apparent reference to Virginia code Section 81, which
has been cast in the light as if it were a statute which
was specifically designed to exclude one competitor from
competing with two Virginia corporations.
That fact is belied by the fact that this
statute applies to every single fishery and fishing
industry in Virginia.

It does not confine itself to the

menhaden fishery.

Seacoast is involved entirely in the

menhaden fishery.

And had it been designed to eliminate
%

Seacoast alone, it could have swept much less broadly and
achieved the same purpose.
In addition, the entire fishing industry supported
this law at the state legislature — legislative level,
not simply the menhaden fishers.
In addition, this particular statute —

MR. MOORE:
QUESTION:

All Virginia fishermen?
All Virginia fishermen.
Yes, but was it prompted by the

menhaden situation?
'MR. 'MOOREj

Mo, sir.

It was promoted bv the

passage of a federal law which extended the federal
fishery zone to 2S0 miles.

The testinonv in recent hearings

before Congress referred to in our reply brief at page ?7
indicates very clearlv that Virginia's fears were real.
The new law at the federal level is going to instigate a
concerted effort by foreign fishing interests to get
around that 200 mile limit through the use of American
shell corporations and United States flag vessels.
QUESTION;

in other words Seacoast and its

competitors have nothing to do whatsoever with the
new statute?
MR.
Seacoast.

moore;

The new statute is not directed at

It's directed at this national problem which

the federal level protection does not afford complete
protection for the states, nor has it been intended to.
QUESTION:

Then Congress could take care of that

by saving that no foreign corporations could operate?
MR. MOORE:
QUESTIONf

it could, your honor, but it has not.
So I mean, your dire results don't

have to happen.
MR. MOORE•

If the federal government were to

act in the same way that Virginia has acted to protect •

its ovm fisheries, that's correct.

-Well, not the same wav, hut some way.

MR. MOORE:
OTTEETIO’T:

Yes, that's correct.
Fell, that's the way Congress acted

with the 1°16 amendments to the shipping Act when the
Germans were trying to huy up control of a creat many
American bottoms.

Couldn't they do the same here?

MR. MOORE:

They did in that case amend the

Shipping Act as to the coast waters trade, that's correct,
and require a 75 per cent ovmership by United States citizen
OTTERTIOU:

General Moore , do you agi*ee with

your opponent's construction of the residency statute,
Section 60, as applying only to inland waters and not to
coastal waters?
MR. MOORE:
correct.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, that's

The reference in that statute to

joint

jurisdiction or jointly controlled waters is to the Potomac
River which is jointly controlled by Marvland and Virginia,
and I — it is not intended to go out into the three mile
belt.

The residency requirement applies only to the inland

waters in the Chesapeake Ray.
Thank you.
MR. CEIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
