MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Kendall, I think perhaps you may proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. KENDALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. KENDALL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I ant David Kendall, first assistant to the Attorney
General of the State of Texas.
Mr. Lonny Zwiener,an

With me this morning are

Assistant Attorney General? and the

Honorable Mark White, Secretary of State of the State of
Texas, who is both licensed to practice in this Court and a
party to this suit.
Despite the fact that in testifying before the
House Committee considering extension of the Voting Rights
Bill Mr. Stanley Pottinger, who was at that time Chief of the
Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, testified
that there was no need to extend the Voting Rights Act in
1975 to the State of Texas, the Act was amended, and on
September 18 of 1975, the Attorney General, Mr. Levi, and
Barabba - of the Bureau of the Census issued a statement which
m©rely recited the requirements of the Voting Rights Act and
then said that the Director of the Bureau of the Census and
the Attorney General had made their determinations pursuant

4
to Sections 4(b) and 4(f)(3) of the Act, and under those
determinations# Texas statewide was now covered by the Act,
published on September 18# 1975.

And that began Texas8 saga

with the Voting Rights Act.
How, some 20 months later and many thousands of
submissions later# we're still submitting every change made in
several thousand voting or election agencies in the State
}

'

V.

from the State itself on down to water districts to the
Attorney General for pre-clearance.
QUESTION:

How many does that average a year# do

you suppose?
MR. KENDALL:

Judge# last night — Mr. Justice

White# last night I looked at the last three notices we’va
received from the Attorney General and they run 18 to 25 a
week from the State of Texas# at this time# 20 months later.
In our brief we say —
QUESTION:

Did you say several thousand?

MR. KENDALL:

Yes# Mr. Justice Brennan.

Our

estimate in the brief is that there have been 5,000 submissions#
and they're going at the rate of 18 to 25 a weak.

Out of that

vast number of submissions, 26 submissions have bean disapproved
according to Secretary White# at this late date.
Our — the petitioners in this suit# the petitioners
in the lower court were the Governor of the State of Texas#
Dolph Briscoe

and Secretary White.

And it was our complaint

5

then, as it is now, that the manner in which we were brought
under the coverage denied us rights, were unfair, and were
not consistent with the statute or with the holdings of this
Court„
We have basically two points; first of all, we say
that the Justice Department, the Attorney General, has
misconstrued

and misapplied Section 4 of theAct in his

instructions to the Bureau of the Census; that portion of the
Act that calls for a determination as to whether

fewer than

50 percent of the citizens of voting age were registered in
1972 or whether fewer than 50 percent of such persons voted
in the Presidential election of that year? also misconstruing
and misapplying Section 4(d), which advises what elements
are to be considered in determining whether or not the State
has used a test or device within the meaning of the Acfc0
We also say that we were mistreated, if you will,
in that the determinations of the Bureau of the Census £hc
of the Attorney General that Texas came within the factual
requirements of the statute were made arbitrarily without
affording the State an opportunity to be heard, without
considering very much evidence which was available at that
time and by which — had it been considered by the Census
Bureau, the determination would have been that Texas was not
covered„
I would- like to make it clear at the outset that we

6

do not question the constitutionality of the Voting Rights
Act.

Wa recognize that that has been determined in South

Carolina against Katzenbach, and we do not raise those issues
at this time.
Under the 1975 amendments, I'll repeat if I may,
there were two determinations to be made to bring Texas or
any other state within the coverage of the Act as amendeds
first of ail, the use — determination by the Attorney General
that in November, 1972, the State or a political subdivision
had used a test or device as newly defined by the Act to
include voting materials in English only? and the second
was that with respect to which state or subdivision the director
of the Census found that fewer, or less than 50 percent of the
citizens of voting age were registered on November 1, 1972,
or thatless than 50 percent of — and again, the magic words —
such persons voted in the presidential election of November,
1972»
It was interesting to hear the Solicitor General
speak about — in the last argument, speak about the need to
determine the questions from the face of the statute.

We

sort of wish the Solicitor's General Office would accord us
the same right, because it is our feeling that when one looks
at the face of the statute with which we're concerned, there's
no question but that we're correct.
The United States, in making its determination as to

7
this 4(b) requirement ignores the first language.

They

don’t even make any determination how many voters were
registered.

They say that’s unimportant, because they find

that fewer than 50 percent of the citizens of voting age
voted, and therefore, coverage is brought in.
We say that the language, such persons, obviously
refers to the words, citizens of voting age who registered,
and that if it is given that interpretation, without dispute,
Texas is not covered.
QUESTION:

Of course the face of the statute does

say that those determinations and certifications by the
Attorney General and by the Director of the Census are
unreviewable in any court.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:
saying

If the Court please, that is correct.

And as I understand it, you’re not

arguing that that’s unconstitutional.
MR. KENDALL:

be reviewed.

No, sir, and we're not asking that they

We filed this suit before they ever made — the

determinations become effective upon publication.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KENDALL:

And we had — Secretary of State

White had made many efforts to go before them and present to
them evidence as to the numbers without success.

And before

they made any determinations, before any thing was published,
we brought this suit asking for injunctive relief and asking

8

that the District Court instruct them as to what thair duty
was in making these determinations.
Liek tha Dunlop case which I heard yesterdayas to
whether or not the Secretary of Labor could reightfully refuse
to bring suit, not review of his determination itself but the
manner in which it was made, we feel that the courts do have
jurisdiction to instruct the Census and the Attorney General5 s:
office as to how they are to go about the process of reaching
these determinations, which they don’t consider determinations
at all.
QUESTION:

What's your authority for thinking that

the courts have that sort of jurisdiction?
MR. KENDALL3

If the Court please, I’d like to say,

I guess, the easy way out is, that no one has questioned it,
the jurisdiction.

But we do rely, for instance, on such

cases as Dunlop v, Bachowski, the Thermtron Products, and so an.
In Thermtron, for instance, where

remand of a removed case

is not reviewable itself, but the Court could —■ this Court
held, it could review the fact that the District Judge refused
to ~ or ““
QUESTION:

fas, exactly.

I was very happy to

As a matter of fact, we didn’t have the Dunlop case

and heard them cite it and went and read it, found

9
it quite applicable.
QUESTIONs

I noticed it wasn't cited in your brief.

MR. KENDALLs

Yes, sir. I'm sorry, it is not.

But

we heard that in the argument.
So we say, we’re not asking —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume there at

Is00 o’clock, Mr. Kendalls
[Whereupon, at 12;00 o’clock, noon, the Court
was recessed, to reconvene at Is00 o’clock, p.xn., the same
day. 3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Kendall, you may

continue.
MR. KENDALLs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

t he Courts
It is our contention that Section 4(b) —• subsection
4(b) of the statute should be so construed that the words,
such person — such persons — refer to persons who are
citizens of voting age who had registered in November of 1972.
It * s uncontroverted that the Census Bureau made no such
determination.

They completely ignored the earlier language

of the Section, that they were to find whether fewer than 50
percent of the citizens of voting age were registered.

They

pay no attention to that.
It’s also uncont rover ted that, using Justice
Department figures, there wax’© seven million and six hundred

10
some odd thousand of voting age,, and according to our figures,
five million, two hundred thousand citizens of the State were
registered»
That being so, more than — way more than 50 percent
of the citizens of voting age were registered, and of such
persons, those five million two hundred, some three million
six hundred thousand, I think it is, voted in the 1972 election
which again is well over 50 percent.

Under our interpretation,

more than 50 percent were registered, and more than 50 percent
of such persons voted in 1972, and Texas is not covered by the
Act.
The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous.
And that was as much as admitted in the Court of Appeals
where Judge MacKinnon said at the outside, appellants would
seem to have the better argument.
It is a rule of statutory construction that
legislative enactments be so construed as to give effect to
all parts.

And as a matter of fact, the United States in its

brief, at page 37, says, whatever force this contention —
referring to our contention ™~ might have as a purely textual
argument.

And X don’t find it shocking that we would insist

that the text of the statute foe followed.
QUESTION s.

That is what we ask-.

But the Administrative agencies who make

these findings have construed the Act this way . from the
beginning, haven’t they?

11
MR. KENDALL:

If the Court please * Mr. Justice

White , Icm not at all sure that that question has ever been
presented before.

They refer to, in their brief, to many

statements by this Court.

And I can't argue with the fact that

has construed these -MR. KENDALLs

That's what they say.

And if it's

true, though, I don't know that it has ever been questioned.
In Congress —
QUESTION:

Wall, it may not have been questioned.

But do you deny that that was the practice?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

No, I do not.

And do you deny that it was the practice

at the time the Act was re-enacted?
MR. KENDALL:
Act was re-enacted.

It was the practice at the time the

And in the Congressional hearings, if we

go to those —- of course, we1d say there's no need to go to
the hearings, because the statute's not ambiguous ■— but if
we go to the history, we'll find them saying that this
language under our construction ■— the Justice Department's
construction *— is unnecessary.

There was even, I think, an

amendment posed to take it out, the language about
registration, and that was defeated.

12
QUESTIONS

But Congress —

MR. KENDALLs
QUESTIONS

Congress left the language in there,,

But Congress certainly was told how

that language was being administered *
MR* KENDALLs

Yes, it was.

If the Court please,

I don't know what the Congress could have done if it didn't
do if it wanted that language given effect.

I'm ~ be facetious,

perhaps, but put a footnote to the statute and say, note —QUESTION:

MR. KENDALLs

--note to the courts? we really mean

We've said it before, we'll say it again, we're saying

it.

There's no other way to say

It couldn't be said any clearer than it was said.

And the

cardinal rule of construction, followed by this Court and as
far as I know, every other court in our nation, is to give
full meaning to the language of the statute.

You don't disre­

gard any language if you can help it.
And yet to follow their analysis and their interp­
retation of the statute, you must just disregard the language
requiring a finding that fewer than 50 percent of the citizens
of voting age ware registered.
QUESTIONS

For whatever it's worth, the doctrine of

legislative acquiescence cuts a little bit the other way,
doesn't it?
MR. KENDALLs

I'm not certain how it cuts in this

13
case where — where they knew that there were efforts made to
take the language out, where they knew that the Attorney
General's office had not been giving it effect, and yet
Congress re-enacted it.

X think they must have intended — as

X say, I don’t know what else they could have done had they
intended it.

It has some effect.

We submit that there is no need to get into a
construction of the Act, because it is so plain *—
QUESTIONS

Of course, the Committee very easily

could have used the same language, and then its reports might
have said that we really mean it.
MR. KENDALL:

Of course, the reports that wa have

don't reflect — reflect really what the very few .Members of
the Congress felt about it — those who voted.

We have

>-

statements by a few.
QUESTIONs

Mr, Kendall, how can you argue that the

statute says, fifty percent of such persons? the question is,
which persons.

You looked at the preceding language, the

parsons described are parsons of voting age.

So one could

certainly argue that such persons refers back to persons of
voting age, can’t we?
MR. KENDALL:

If the Court please, Mr, Justice

Stevens, if you do take that position, then you disregard the
language of the first Section, because it becomes meaningless,
as the Justice Department says.

They don’t need to make a

14
finding as to how many ware registered.

Because there will

always be fewer who voted than there were registered.
QUESTIONS

0hr I understand that* I understand

that practical effect.

But graraatically* one could read it

the way your opponents do* I think.
MR. KENDALL:

We think that it takes a stretch.

Now* the original act as enacted in 1965 talked about the —
the language was 50 percent of persons of voting age.
it was amended in this to say* citizens.

And

And we think the

reference here is clearly to citisens of voting age who
registered* such persons* did 50 percent of them vote.
We have the same problem with reference to Section ;
4(d) of the Act.

4(d) *— in Section 4 — applied — the

language is* for the purposes of this Section* no State or
political subdivision shall be determined to have engaged in
the use of tests or devices for the purpose or with the effect
of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race
or color -- and so on — if incidents of such use have been
few in number and have been promptly and effectively

•i

corrected — and other factors to be considered in determining
whether or not a jurisdiction uses tests or devices.
The

Justice Department disregards the language

that says * for the purposes of this Section* and says that
that applies only to a bailout suit under Section 4(a)', and
not to a determination under 4(b).

We don't know how they

15
make that selection.

One of the triggers for coverage of a

state under the Act is a determination of the Justice
Department that in November , 1972, the State or the
political subdivision employed a test or device.
We submit — we feel that we could meet the tests
of 4(d), but in any event, the Justice Department should have
been required to maintain or to look into that question.
QUESTION;
4 (b) ?

Well, how would you apply 4(d) to

4 (b) just says you ~ you make- some calculations,

and that’s the end of it.
MR. KENDALL;

One of the triggers, if the Court

please,, is a prior determination by the Attorney General that
the jurisdiction employed in November — employed a test or
device as defined in 4 Cc) •—*
QUESTION:

Now, where is that?

All right, all right,

I got that.
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:
test or devices

I'm sorry.

Maintained on November 1, 1964, any

it says any test or device with respect to

which....
MR. KENDALL:

Well, if the Court please, I think

obviously this Act must be to sustain its constitutionality
as the Court did in South Carolina against Katssenbac h, it must
be aimed at tests or devices which have the purpose or effect
of discriminating in voting rights.

And it can't be just any

16
test or device regardless»

And we submit that 4(d) is a

proper test of how —- of whether or not a jurisdiction is
maintaining, did maintain, a test or device, not just for
take out.
Again, Congress very easily could have said for
the purposes of Section 4Ca), a test or device means.
didn’t say that.

It

It says, for the purposes of this section»

And this section is section 4.

And we submit that at least

Congress — the Attorney General’s office should have given
consideration to whether or not Texas met the tests of 4(d).
QUESTION:

When you say they should have given

consideration, does

that mean anything more than in their

internal deliberations they should have maybe considered this
and perhaps rejected it?
MR. KENDALL:

That, I think *— if they gave good

faith attention to it, considered it, I think that would meet
the requirement.

But they expressly state that they did not,

do not, and will not.

And that's what we're challenging.

We're not challenging their finding, that Texas
maintained a test or device.
in which they arrived

We’re challenging the method

at that finding, just arbitrarily

reading the statute as they would read it, not paying any
attention to 4 (d).

And we say that, the statute requires that

they consider those questions and make their determination.
QUESTION:

Well, but, can you be certain that at

17
some time or other the Attorney General of the Civil Rights
Division or somebody hasn’t at least given some thought to
this suggestion of yours and rejected it?
MR. KENDALL:

If the Court please, I'm sure they've

given thought to our suggestion that they ought to consider
it.

And I'm equally sure -- and I'm sorry I can't tell you

chapter and verse — but I’m equally sure that they have said
that they would not consider it.

They say in their brief

that they don't consider it, and they're not required t©„

And

we say they ere.
The other point I'd like to make very briefly is
that they have failed to consider evidence which was readily
available to them.

Now, using their figures *— and we’re not

in the numbers game — but they start out with a figure
which they get by interpolation that there were 7,655,00.0
citizens of voting age in Texas on November 1, 1972.

And we

don't agree with that figure, but we'li accept: it for the
sake of this argument*
Then they go, they say there are 140,000 aliens in
Tescas, despit e the fact that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has published a report saying that in November, 1972,
there were 2,600,000 illegal Mexican aliens in the United
States*'

Now, they don't say how many in Texas*
But we submit, they're the ones who determine upon :

the need to deleta, to deduct, the number of aliens in arriving

18
at the citisens of voting age? not we.
QUESTIONs

As a matter of fact, Mr. Kendall, in

your brief on page 24, you suggest that perhaps half of the
number ware living in Texas, and then on 25, you say, of
which it may be estimated that a quarter were living in
Texas.
MR. KENDALL:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Justice Blackmun, we

have no way of knowing how many, as I say.
responsibility, not ours, I think.

That's their

But we're saying again, I

don't want to say a particular figure, we made some suggestions
in our brief as to what it might be, but what we are saying is
that they ware required to do more than just guess at what the
figures might be, and use a figure which I think to any
Texan would be absurd, to say that there are only 140,000
aliens, legal and illegal, in Texas, on November 1972 of
voting age.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't the Immigration Department

right in the Department of Justice?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

I believe it is.

Well, they could get the figures right

there, couldn't they?
MR. KENDALL:

This was fromthe Census — this

figure ~~ there were determinations made by Census .
QUESTION:

I mean, how do you assume that the

Department didn't have those figures?

19
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTIONS

They said they didn’t.

They didn’t have the immigration figures?

MR. KENDALL :

They said they did not use ~ they

used figures from the Bureau of the Census.
QUESTIONS

They didn’t say they didn’t have them.

MR. KENDALL:
them, I’m sorry.

No* they didn’t say they didn’t have

But they didn’t use them.

Mr. Sitter, in

his affidavit which is at the record, I think, page 155 of the
Appendix, tells how the determination was made.
QUESTION?
anyway?

Well, wouldn't that be a wash out

The figures would cancel themselves out.

If you

had —■ let's even assume you had 5,000,000 illegal aliens in
Texas, and that were added to the total of persons of voting
ag® in Texas.

Then the next step would be to subtract tb.afc

5,000,000 in order to give you a — whatever it’s called,
a subtrahend, no, or -- in any event, a result of citizens
of voting age in Texas eligible to vote.

Whatever the figure

was, it would just cancel itself out, whether it was 1 or
10 million.
MR. KENDALL:

That is the position the United

States has taken is that the same figure —

Right.

And then the next thing you do is

And it doesn't make any difference what x is, it's

MR. KENDALL:

Well, we feel, if the Court please,

that they are under an obligation to consider these figures,
and they are the ones, as I say, who determine that a figure
was necessarily subtracted for illegal aliens.

And we submit

that they should be required to consider all of the evidence,
again, on that factor.

I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas©

the Courts
I would like to just describe the Voting Rights Act:

22

Amendments of 1975 as they8re relevant to this case, then
discuss the statutory preclusion of review of the coverage
determinations aa contained in Feetion 4(h) of the statute
as it affects the district court's jurisdiction? and then
address the merits of the contentions Texas has advanced,,
The statute appears in the brief in opposition .
filed by the respondents at Appendix 1A through SA.

There

are one or two provisions which we have not set forth which

I will mention briefly.
One preliminary word: the statute was adopted with
Texas specifically in mind insofar as the minority language,
group guarantee, is concerned.

Both the Senate and the House '

report describo this in detail as did the hearings.
Now, the 1975 amendments contained anumber of
titles.

In Title II of the amendments. Congress made express

findings in Section 4ff)(1) -- that's on page 4A — that
voting discrimination against citizens of certain enumerated
language minorities was pervasive and national in scop®, a
and that to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments,

009

it was necessary to eliminate that discrimination by pro­
hibiting English only elections as to those people, and by
adopting other remedial devices.
The term, language-minority, was in turn defined
in Section 14(c)(3)., of the Act, which we have not printed, to
mean persons belonging to American Indian, native Alaskan,

or Spanish heritage groups.
The devices under Title II that Congress adopted
included extension of the existing Voting Rights Act
prohibitions against the use of testing devices as a
prerequisite for voting? a requirement for pre-clearance under
Section 5 of changes in the covered jurisdiction’s election
laws? and where necessary, the assignment of Federal examiners
to register voters.
Now, let me distinguish Title II from Title III
because there is some material in the record that refers to
Title III.

In Title III of the amendments, Congress also

adopted some

separate remedies for jurisdletions in which

minority language voters were disad.vantaged because of
educational deficiencies, but there didn't seem to be evidence
of intentional discrimination.
Jurisdictions covered by this provision must also
cover

conduct elections only in English,

but the special

remedies, such as Section 5 or voting examiners, are not
applicable.
How, we’re not cor.camad with Title III in this
case at all.
In this case we are concerned really only with
members of the Spanish heritage category of language minority.
In .Section 4 (f) (2) of the Act, Congress prohibited
denial orabridgement of the right to vote because a person

'

is a member of an enumerated language minority.

24

It added

a third sentence to the existing triggering provisions
providing that the prohibition against the use of tests and
devices contained in the Act would apply in State and political
subdivisions as to which the Attorney General determined main­
tained on November 1, 1972* any test or device, as defined in
the Act, and with respect to which the Director of the Census
determined that less than 50 percent of the citisens of voting
age were registered, or less than SO percent voted in the
presidential election of November, 1972.
Now, this was a change in the coverage formula.

The

previous coverage formula, in the 1965 Act and the 1970 Act
had referred to persons of voting age.

Because Congress was

addressing the problem of language minorities, for the first
time it focused on citisens voting only.

And it adopted a

change in the third sentence, specifying that only citisens
could vote.

That's how the alienage problem got into our

case.
Tha term, test or device, had been defined under the
old Act as meaning prerequisites for voting requiring
demonstration of literacy or educational achievement or
knowledge, good moral character, or proof of qualification
by some sort of vouchering.
In Section 4(f)(3), Congress amended the definition
of test or device to add a new concept, which is what we are

25
dealing with here»

It referred to the provision of voting

materials only in the English language where the director of
the Census determines that more than 5 percent of the citizens
of voting age residing in the State or political subdivision
are members of a single language minority.
Now, the 1965 Act,, as amended, makes no provision
in these triggering sections, for hearing.

It also bars

review of a determination by an Attorney General or Director
of the Census, with respect to the triggering provisions.
Now this is contained —
QUESTION?

Thatprovision barring review -- was it

4 <b) ?
MR. SHAPIRO %

4(b), it's in Section 4(b), your

Honor, on page —
QUESTION s

4(b).

Does that mean that if the

Attorney General objects, based on these —- this data, and Texas
should file a suit, in the Three-Judge District Court hare in
the District of Columbia, that the figures would not be open
to challenge there either?

Or does that just mean thatthey

cannot challenge the administrative determination?
MR. SHAPIRO?

As I understand it, your honor, the

bar against review would affect proceedings in the Three-Judge
Court in the District of Columbia to bail out of the
coverage under Section 4(a| —
QUESTION %

In any court?

26

MR. SHAPIRO5

In any court,

it says.

Now, the

determination bythe District Court in the District of Columbia
is whether the tests or devices have been maintained for the
purpose or with the effect of discriminating or in violation of
the language guarantees.
The only way in

which the Attorney General’s

determination that a test or device was maintained could be
challenged was if the jurisdiction came in and said, we
couldn't be using it for discriminatory purposes because we
don't have any.
QUESTION?

But aren’t they bound by the Attorney

General8 s determinations that they do have it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Wall, the nature of the determination

thatthe Attorney General makes is such that I don't think
there will ever be
QUESTION s

an issue of that kind.
Yes, but you would certainly say in

the District of Columbia Three-Judge Court the provision
4(d) would be open?

I mean ~

MR. SHAPIRO:
open.

Oh, yes, the provisions of 4(d) are

Now, 4{d) is expressly addressed to whether the test

or device was maintained for the purpose or with the *— for
a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect.
QUESTION s

But the question •—•

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is the 4(d) inquiry —

1 know, but -

27
MR. SHAPIRO:

— and it’s addressed only — I'm

sorry.
QUESTION;

4(d) says, if the incidence of such

use have been a few in number and promptly and effectively
corrected.
MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Yes? then the Court is not to hold ---

And the continuing effects of such

incidents have been eliminated.
MR. SHAPIRO;

That's right.

So the Court is then

to hold that the use of the test or device is not t© b@
treated as discriminatory in purpose or effect.
QUESTION;

The State is bound by the finding that

they have been using a test and device when they go into
the

Three-Judge District Court?
MR. SHAPIRO;

They are.

I think it would be open

to them only to say that as part of their proof that they
weren't discriminating, that they didn't have the test, and
they couldn't go beyond that.
Well, returning to the structure of the statute
then
QUESTION;

Before you go on; maybe you've already

answered this, Mr. Shapiro, so I missed it.

On page 5A of tha

Appendix to your response in opposition, the very last sentence
on page 5A under little 3 there, with respect to section 4(b) 1
the ter®, test or device, as defined in this subsection, which

28
is the foreign language subsection, shall be employed only
in making the determinations under the third sentence of that
subsection.

Which is the third sentence * and what does that

mean?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thatrefers* your Honor * to the third

sentence of *—
QUESTION s

Of 4(b).

MR. SHAPIRO:

— section 4(b)* which set up the

new triggering provisions.
QUESTION:

And that5s on page 2A.

2A?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes* sir.

It actually begins — let’s

see where — let me make sure I’ve got my pages

I’m sorry*

your Honor* that’s 3A.
QUESTION:

Which is the third sentence?

MR. SHAPIRO:

And that begins —- actually* it’s

4A* X bag your pardon.
QUESTION:

Top of 4A.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Top of 4A: on or after August 6* 1975*

that was the date of the enactment of these amendments —
QUESTION:

Yeah.

MR. SHAPIRO:
ara stated.

And then the new triggering provisions

The preceding two sentences are the original

1965 —
QUESTION:

I see* so it’s just --

MR. SHAPIRO:

-- provisions and the 1970 extension.

29
Returning then to the structure of the statute,
I've just mentioned that under section 4{a} there can be a
bail-out suit with respect to a determination of the use of
a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect.
This is the only time that such an inquiry is made with respect
to the definition of test or device.

There's nothing in

section 4(c) defining the original test or device.

Nothing

in section4(f)(3) defining the new language, test or device,
authorises an inquiry into whether or not test or device has
a purpose or effect.
So that when you go back to the triggering provisions,
and look at what the Attorney General has to determine, you
will see that on page 4A, all that he determines is whether
the jurisdiction maintained on November X, 1975, any test ©r
device.

There's ng statutory authorisation for the triggering

determination to inquire into whether it was used with a
discriminatory purpose or effect.

Congress made that determi­

ne!on, in the exercise of its powers.
Now, I'd like to talk about the jurisdiction, because
Section 4(b) bars review in any court of a determination or
certification of the Attorney General or Director of the
Census under Section 4 and certain other enumerated sections.
First 1 must say that the Attorney General now agrees with the
Court of Appeals in construction of section 4(b), which *— the
Court of Appeals held that there was a very, very limited ground

30
for inquiry under this statute, and that this suit is
permitted because of that very limited inquiry.
Let me say at the outset that in Gaston County v.
the United States? under the old act, in 395 U.S., the
Court stated at page 291 that the coverage formula chosen by
Congress was designed to be speedy, objective, and
incontrovertible.

As we read Section 4(b), the only matter that

ran be open to record

open to review on this record — is

whether the Attorney General or the Director of the Bureau of
the Census, applied soma coverage formula other than the
formula chosen by the Congress.

And that is all that cars be

reviewed,
Inthe face of an express preclusion of judicial
review, worded like Section 4(b), the only inquiry that0 s
available on this record is whether the defendants exceeded
their statutory

authority.

QUESTION:

So if they — if TExas said, well,

they made these calculations, but the — Census Bureau said,
read
well, we've/the statutes, but we think it just should be 25
percent, instead of 50.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That!s unreviewable — well, no,

if they said 25 percent instead of 50, that would be
reviewable.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SHAPIRO:

If they said, we will —• although the

31
statute said * citizens, we're going to count aliens de­
liberately, that's —
QUESTION s

Reviewable.

MR. SHAPIRO;

— reviewable.

If, however, as in

this case, they say, we know we're not supposed to count
aliens.

We've made an estimate of the number of aliens we

think we should deduct, and we've deducted them from our
calculations.

That is unreviewable.

QUESTIONS

Why doe? the Government concede as much

as it does in the light of that express preclusion provision?
MR. SHAPIRO ;

The — after some consideration of the

precedents, wa felt we ware bound to.

As we assessed that

particular provision, we can only see three possible bases for
judicial review, if review is the right word, because it isn't
really a review; first, if there was a claim that the statute
was unconstitutional.
?

Then we think that despite that express

preclusion, under Johnson against Robeson in 415 U.S.,
jurisdiction would exist.
QUESTION;
understand it.

That's not before us.

Mr. Shapiro, just to make sure I

If the next time the Attorney General turns

down any submission that Texas makes to us, if Texas then
want into the Tree-Judge Court, it could have the determinations
made under 4 (d) , and it would, go right back to whether or not
the Texas — was legitimately brought under the Act.
MR. SHAPIRO;

Well, no, the 4(d) determination goes

32
to whether the test or device was used with a discriminatory
purpose or effect®

and the Three-Judge Court would make a deter

minafcion as to that®
QUESTION:

I know®

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

But let's assume —

And only that.

— let's assume that Texas makes a

change in voting procedures, and it isn't about a test or
device at all, it's something brand new that's never bean used
before.
ME® SHAPIRO:

Section 5 — that would cosae before

the Attorney General under Section 5 of the Act®
QUESTION:

All right®

And then they — the Attorney

General turns it down.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:
MR.

He objects to it®

He objects to it.

SHAPIRO:

That’s a different type of suit,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right.

But then Texas goes into

the Three-Judge Court saying, the Attorney General's dead wrong®
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

As it can.

That's completely within

Well, I know, it may be completely

but they've never used the test or device, because it’s
never been in effect — the one the Attorney General turns
down — so how does 4(d) come into it?
Mr® SHAPIRO:

Oh, 4(d) comes in only with respect

33
to the triggering provisions of Section 4.
QUESTION %

That's what I mean.

All right, now,

Texas could, then, go back and under 4(d) review the — to
the extent 4(d) permits it, could review the triggering
decisions, original triggering decisions, that put Texas under
the Act.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Not completely.

There would be —

Well, to the extent that 4(d) permits

it.
MR. SH2YPIR0:

To the extent that 4 {d) permits it —

well, the trouble is that the triggering determination by the
Attorney General under Section 4 does not inquire whether the
test or device was used with discriminatory purpose or effect.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But Texas can have

that determination made in a Three-Judge Court.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

In the bail-out suit under Section 4(a).

Exactly.

So that the next time that

Texas is turned down, it could have that determination made
in a Three-Judge Court?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, when wesay, next time, let's

distinguish between two sections of this statute, because
it won't crane over unless

I make the distinction.

We're

dealing here with Section 4, which extends the coverage of the
Act to the jurisdictions that meet the test.
if

:

QUESTION:

I understand that.

34

MR. SHAPIRO:

Once the jurisdiction is covered bi­

section 4
QUESTION:

Yes?

MR. SHAPIRO:

— it is subject to the remedies of

Section 5.
QUESTION s

Exactly.

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Section 5 remedy requires

preclearance by the Attorney General.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Section 5 has a separate provision,

not the same as the bail-out six it , which authorises a juris­
diction to go into the District Court for the District of
Columbia and clear any proposed change in its voting law.

And

the Section 4(d) has nothing to do with that Section 5 suit.
QUESTION:

Well, has Texas — all right, has

Texas ever gone into theThree-Judge Court on a bail-out
suit?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Not to my knowledge.

4(d) has nothing to do with
QUESTION:

But Section

it.

Well, the argument that it's making, about

the fact that it had already cleaned itself up by the time the
amendments went into effect, that —
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yeah, that—

—- argument it could make in a bail-out

suit?
MR. SHAPIRO:

In a bail-out suit under Section 4,

35

that is right,
QUESTION;

Yes, all right»

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION;

And only there.

Mr. Shapiro, I'm still not clear.

Under

4(d), could Texas have sought relief the day after the
Attorney General decided thatit was under the Act?
MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

It could.

When is Texas entitled to avail itself

of 4 fd) relief?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Texas may avail itself of a suit under

4(d) at any time it files a bail-out suit under Section 4(a)
of the Act, which —
QUESTION;

You're saying that 4 ~

MR. SHAPIRO;

Now, the bail-out formula is under

Section 4(a) — is set forth in pages 1A and 2A of the
Appendix, the statutory appendix, and what it provides is that
a state as to which a triggering determination has been made,
that that's subjecting the state tothe

coverage of the Act,

can file a suit in a Three-Judge Court in the District of
Columbia —
QUESTION;

I know they can — but only there.

MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

And only there.

A bail-out suit, only —

MR. SHAPIRO;

A foaii-oufc suit? in fact, any suit

under this Act can only be brought in the District of Columbia,

36
There's a venue limitation under Section 14.
The bail-out suit can be brottght in the District
Court for the District of Columbia*, and try to show that no
such test or device has been used during the ten years
preceding the filing of the action for the purpose or with the
effect of denying the right to vote on account of race or
color or —QUESTION %

Seventeen years, isn't it?

MR.SHAPIROs

The -- if it was triggered under the

Act because of the language, minority provisions, it's only
ten.
QUESTIONS

I see.

MR. SHAPIROt
QUESTIONS

As set forth on page 2A.

But, now, you're conceding, as I

understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, that the
determination or certification of the Attorney General that's
referred to on page 4A of the respondent's — your brief in
opposition, is subject to limited review in something other
than a bail-out suit? is that right?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And I was about to —

Okay.

MR. SHAPIRO:
three possible grounds.

—outline — okay.

I suggested

One, if Texas was challenging the

constitutionality of the statute, that the bar against review
would not apply:

Johnson against Robeson.

37
Second, if this were a suit in the nature of an action
in mandamus to corapel some sort of duty owed to Texas of a ~
s®h as to make a determination under the Act» we — then we
think that there might be relief under 28 U.S.C. 1361* for
example, to compel the Attorney General to make up his mind.
That’s not this case.

This is essentially a challenge to

determination.
Third, a claim that the action is in plain violaticn
of an expressed statutory requirement or prohibition.

And

to the extent there is any review, and there is a very limited
review, that comes into this case.
QUESTION :
23»3

This is the government's effort to

reconcile its position here with its position in Gressette.
I take it.
MR. SHAPIRO:

We seek to be consistent in our

argument, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION s

The second alternative is certainly
..

consistent.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

The mandamus action

I should

point out that the mandamus action in Gressette involves a
suit to make the Attorney General decide something.
QUESTION:

Make up their minds.

MR. SHAPIRO:

And this is not that kind of a case.

The Attorney General has decided here.

Moreover, I point out

38

that section 4(b) is an espress restriction on judicial
review.

The action in Gressette is under Section 5,

There

is no statutory bar of the same kind to the Section 5 mandamus
that you might find in Section 4 (b),
Wellf now, this is the first case to reach this
Court under the Voting Rights Act amendments of 1975,

And

Texas has been brought under the Act for the first time in
these amendments.

It wasn’t under the earlier Act, because

it didn’t maintain the kind of test or device described in the
previous statute.
It’s conceded there’s no issue as to constitutionality<
Now, there’s no issue — it’s conceded that Texas used a
test or device within the meaning of the language minority
definition contained in section 4(f)(3) of the Act, because
Texas has more than 5 percent citizens of voting age of
Spanish heritage,

and it concedes that it furtished election

materials only in English,
So there’s just no issue as to what the Attorney
General was to decide.

The statute says the Attorney General

decides whether they maintained a test or device within the
meaning of section 4{£)(3)j they concede that they did.

No

issue as to that.
They contend, however, that the Attorney General
should have considered whether they used it for a dis­
criminatory purpose or effect.

The statute doesn’t just

39
authorise the Attorney General to decide that»

It’s not in

there.
QUESTIONS
be clear:

Well# Mr. Shapiro, again, so that I’ll

your position on the extent of reviewability is

that errors of law are not reviewable?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I would have to say that to the

extent the error of law is one that does not go to whether
the Attorney General acted —- whether the official has acted
in excess of his authority.

It depends on how much discretion

he's been given.
QUESTION:

So you don’t really need to argue what

is the right construction of the statute with respect to 50
percent, whether it refers to voting age people or whether it
refers to registered voters.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, we —

You couldn’t care less, because it’s just

an error of law, whatever if. is, and the Attorney General’s
judgment about the statute is final? is that right?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That formula is specific enough so that

we think it comes within the excess of authority -- test I
mentioned.
QUESTION:

But you just say it doesn’t make any

difference whether it’s wrong or not.
MR. SHAPIRO;
and answering it —

Well, answering the question generally?

40
QUESTION?

Well, generally, no, X8m asking you

that question.
MR. SHAPIRO:

— specifically are two different

things.
QUESTION:

I’m asking you that question.

MR. SHAPIRO:

All right.

Answerring your specific

question, since the statute expressly says, 50 percent of
persons of voting — of citizens of voting age, the 50 percent
work -QUESTION:

But you know it to be construed either

way?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we couldn’t use less than 50

percent without acting in excess of the statute.
before was that we can't use

What I said

a coverage formula different

than that specified by Congress.
QUESTION:

But you. say the issue of the proper

construction of that statute is just not open in any review?
No court ■—
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, one could construe 50 percent

to mean 25 parcant.
QUESTION:

Your position is that no court has any

business giving a judgment as to what the proper construction of
that statute is.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, no, I think what I said was that

if the Attorney General or the Bureau of the Census attempted

41
to apply a formula different than that expressed in the
language -QUESTION :

No, no, no, no, he says, look, I'm

applying the statute»

Here's my construction of the language»

And as long as he says that, and goes that route, isn’t that the
end of it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

As long as it's within a reasonable

scope, yes.
QUESTION:

As long as it's 50 percent of something,

MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION:

If he chooses 50 percent, and --

Then it's non-reviewable?

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Right.

If he said 25 percent, you say it would

be reviewable?
MR. SHAPIRO:
way.

Let me try and illustrate it in this

Insofar as Texas is arguing that as a matter of law the

Director of the Census

erred in relying on census data — you

know, he had to determine how many citizens there ware, he
had to find out from some source where that information came
from? he didn't use the Immigration and Naturalization figures,
he used his own 1970 decennial census projections.
Now, to the extent that he relied on his own data,
and he.made a calculation for alienage, that's not reviewable.
Congress knew that — that there's a limitation on how manir
on how you can determine who's an illegal alien and who there

42
wasn't.
Now? insofar as Texas is contending that it’s
excluded from the Act because more than 50 percent of its
citizens of voting age were registered but less than 50 percent
actually voted, it’s raising an issue of law as to the meaning
of the statute.

We think that that much is raviewable.

We

also think it’s contentions are defeated by the plain legis­
lative history.

Because Attorney General Katzenbach got up

and actually said the words? such persons in this statute
means parsons who actually voted.

The statute has been

legislated — has been re-enacted, it's been construed that
way consistently.
Now, finally, there’s a claim about a hearing.
The issues — the triggering determinations here involve what
the Court called, in South Carolina against Katzenbach,
objective statistical determinations by the Census Bureau, and
a routine analysis of state statutes by the Department of
Justice.
Issues of that kind don’t require a hearing.

IN any

event, the hearing, such as is required, is provided after the
fact in the bail-out suit, except to the extent thafcfche
triggering determination can't be reviewed.

But a state can

get out from under this statute — can get out from under
4(a) —in the bail-out suit in connection with its contention
that if the test or device which it concedes in this case was

43
not used for discriminatory purpose or effect.
QUESTIONS

What period 'of limitation, if any,

is there against bringing a bail-out suit?
MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTION;

There is none.

You can bring one the first day?

MR. SHAPIRO;

Could be brought today?

It could

be brought today, your Honor.
QUESTION;

But it would have to be brought in the

District of Columbia.
MR. SHAPIRO;

It would have to be brought in the

District Court for the District of Columbia, as any suit under
the Voting — challenging a determination under the Voting
Rights Act must be.

Section 14{b) of the Voting Rights Act

requires that.
QUESTION;

How about your limited review that

you’re talking about under 4(d), where it started out here with
the single judge, want to the Court of Appeals?

Any reason

why that has to be brought in the District of Columbia?
MR. SHAPIRO;

It would have to —-the venue provision

in 14(b) expressly says that any suit to enjoin or declare an
action of an official under this Act must be brought in the
District Court for the Distric of Columbia.
QUESTION;

So that’s a broader provision than the

venue provision for the —
MR. SHAPIRO;

It’s much broader.

There are a number

44
of bail-cut provisions in this Act.

There are the special

bail-out provisions under Section? there's a special
provision for challenging Section 5 determinations? there's
a special provision under Title III for the more moderate
language restrictions.

All of those suits, as far as I can

recall, must be brought in the District Court for the District
of Columbia.
Indeed, the fact that Congress, in Section 14(b)
mentions the possibility of a suit to enjoin the action of an
official indicates that it anticipated the possibility that
there would be soma areas where official action could be cha?~lengad, could be reviewed.
Sometimes it specified a Three-Judge Court, as in
a bail-out suit, or in a Section 5 suit.
QUESTION;
that the

Sometimes it

did not.

Mr. Shapiro, how many people do youknow

Attorney General has reviewing submissions from the

States from all over the country?
MR. SHAPIRO;

The voting — I don't know the total

number of people in the Voting Rights section.
QUESTION;

It must be substantial, if there are 20

a week from Texas.
MR. SHAPIRO;

Well, of course, Texas has been an

unusual problem, because Texas has 254 counties, and an enormous
number of election districts of one kind and another; water
districts, voting districts, school districts, municipalities.

45

Despite — the Act also was retroactive to 1972, so that
there has been a large backlog.

Most of these changes have

been what Attorney General Katzenbach

anticipated, rather

pro forma changes that don't affect significant rights.
The ones that the Attorney General has been concerned
about are those that change at-large elections? some statewide
procedures that called, for example, for a purge ~
QUESTIONs

Well, anyway, is it a rather large ’ *

section that does this?
MR. SHAPIROs
QUESTIONS

It's quite a large section —

Larger since Texas was covered?

MR. SHAPIROs

I imagine — I assume it’s been

expanded, and I think it's still overwhelmed, your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Doesn't Georgia have 200 comities, too?

Georgia has a whole lot of counties.

case, is ~*“

action was brought before or after the Attorney General ruled
that Texas was subject to the Act?
MR. SHAPIROs

The original complaint was filed

before the Attorney General had made his determination.

I

think it was filed just after the Bureau of the Census had
made its determination.

The Attorney General decided the case

46
after the District Court ruled, dismissing the complaint.
The Court of Appeals noted that fact, but concluded that
since the issue was before it, there was no point in sending
the case back for what would be a simple fo'vaal reconsideration.
So it addressed the question of the Attorney General's —
QUESTION:

I'm just interested in how Texas and

the United States government can come to issue on what seems
to foe the merits of this case.

Texas was brought under this

statute by virtue of a test or device that was repealed by
Texas before the statute became effective.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The language of the statute is whether

the State maintained a test or device on November 1, 1972.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But it does not

maintain that test or device now, or as of the date the statute
became effective.

And if Texas had instituted this suit the

day after they had received the letter fromthe Attorney
General, I understand you to say that they could have
instituted this suit or another suit as
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

a bail-out action.

That's correct.

So what you're saying perhaps is that

Texas went to court too soon? is that a possibility?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we think that the batter

remedy would have been for them to file a bail-cut suit, if
they can demonstrate —
QUESTION:

But wouldn't it have been a better

47
remedy still for the Attorney General to have considered the
requirements of 4fd), which starts out by saying, for
purposes of this section, in the same section with 4(b)?
MR. SHAPIRO:

But the clear implication of 4(a) is

that it will apply with respect to the determination for the
purposes or with the effect of maintaining a discriminatory
test or device.

Now, the Attorney General does not make that

inquiry.
QUESTION?

I'm just wondering why he doesn't.

MR. SHAPIRO:
him to.

Because the statute doesn't authorise

Section 4(b) provides only that he will determine

whether the test or device was maintained.
Now, Texas may bring a bail-out suit, within the
meaning of the Act.

And it may point to its 1975 statute and

say, that shows that we are not maintaining a test or device
wit discriminatory purpose or effect, and haven't done so
and that any incidents of discrimination were sporadic, as
described in 4(d).
QUESTION:

And I gather they could do that this

a fternoon?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

In the District of Columbia.

MR. SHAPIRO:
District of Columbia;

They could do that this afternoon

And that would be an issue for the
they haven't brought such a suit because

I think that the history of discrimination in Texas which led

48
to the adoption of this act is such that they cannot meet the
standard in such a suit, although I'm simply speculating.
They may very well prevail in such a suit,
Thank you, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But they're free to try?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Mr. Kendall.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. KENDALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. KENDALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
First of all, I'd like to point out that the
difference between a bail-out suit and what we're asking here,
is, we're asserting that we're not covered and never were
covered and had they construed the statute correctly, we would
not be covered now.
QUESTION:

There would be no —
That's what a bail-out suit is for.

MR. KENDALL:

If the Court please, a bail-out suit

we would have the burden of proving that for ten years —- this
suit — the test goes back to November of 1972; and a bail-out
suit, if we filed it today, would go back to 1367.

And in

Texas, there's a great deal of difference.
But we feel that a. bail-out suit at this time would
ba premature.

And we consider the fact that we're not covered

inthe first placa.

49

QUESTION:

But in a bail-out suit, you get the bene­

fit of 4(d) .
MR, KENDALL:

We feel that we're entitled to the

benefit of 4(d) now.
QUESTION:

I know.

But in the bail-out suit, you

would have the benefit of it.
MR. KENDALLs

We would have the benefit of it, as

we feel we ought to have the benefit of it now, as Mr. Justice
Powell suggested.
I would like to answer, if I may, Mr. Justice
Stewart's questions earlier that I couldn't get thinking
straight on.

According to their statistics, they took the

Census Bureau figures for all citizens, all residents of the
State.
QUESTION s

Of voting age.

MR. KENDALL:

Of — no, I'm sorry.

deducted from that figure those under 18.

Well, then they

So they got a

figure for all residents of the State of voting age.

And

then according to their formula, they then deducted 14©,000
as being the number of aliens who were included in thatfigure.
And we submit that by any reasonable, means, 140,000
is a ridiculous figure for Texas as the number of aliens who
ware resident in the State at that time.
QUESTION:
legal and illegal?

How many cross the border every month.

It*s in the hundreds of thousands.

I'm not certain of the figures.

MR. KENDALL:

But we feel that

had Census made any effort to determine the number by consulting
with Immigration end Naturalisation Service it could have
d etermined them.
QUESTION:

How does that help you or us now?

MR. KENDALL:

We ask that the — a declaratory

judgment, which is our prayer, that the Census Bureau, in

51
making this determination, be required to use the best
j

information available to determine the number of citizens of
voting age in the State; and that they did not do that and
the case ought to be remanded to them to make that

,

determination whatever it may come out to be.

They acknowledge ,

I think, that they didn’t use immigration figures or anything
else.

They used answers to two questions on the Census form,

which are at bast ambiguous.
Contrary to what Mr. Shapiro said, we do not
concede that we used English only for discrimnatory purposes.
And we think that this vastly distinguishes this case from the
Katzenbach case.

In South Carolina against Kat2enbachy the

Court found that the proceedings were constitutional

of a hearing — because South Carolina these were figures which
were beyond dispute.

There was no argument about them.

And

South Carolina was covered according to Mr. Chief Justice
Warren’s opinion.
And that is not true here.

that statewide in Teras as In every other state of the Union,
English-only ballots have been traditionally used, not as a
discriminatory device.

And if you read the history set out by

the amicus curiae in their brief as to the circumstances

this

was aimed against, it was aimed against things that had nothing
to do with English ballots
Thank you.

BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
