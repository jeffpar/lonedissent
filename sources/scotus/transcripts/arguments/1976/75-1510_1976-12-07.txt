PR O C E E D I N G S
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W©‘11 hear arguments next

in No. 151Q# Weatherford against Bursey.
Mr. Coleman# you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH C. COLEMAN# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

•the Court:
I'm going to take a little of my time to review the
facts# which I realise are already in the record.
do think it important for this reason:

However# I

to show a little more

clearly the relationship between the two principals in this
case — and when I say th© two principals, I*m speaking of
Weatherford and Bursey? although# of course, Strom is a
defendant and was the South Carolina Law Enforcement chief.
These ©vents occurred# the events leading up to this
litigation occurred in 1970# approximately at the end of a
period of several years of dissension on 'the college campuses
of this country and# I believe# other parts of the world as
well.
Weatherford was a salaried undercover police agent.
I think that's important to remember in this case? not
controlling# but important.

He has been referred to in the can®

as a paid informer, and I guess in the broad sense, he was.
But# nevertheless# he was a hired salaried member of the

4
.South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, assigned to undercover
work, as opposed to an informer who might ba paid by the job
or by the person ha turned in? he was not that tvp© of
individual.
He was also a student at the University of South
Carolina.

His principal assignment was to report to the other

defendant Strom, who was and is the chief or head of the
South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which is, of course,
the chief police agency or the State Police of South Carolina,
other than the State Highway Patrol.
The plaintiff Dursey — plaintiff below Bursay,
of course, was a student at the University of South Carolina.
And -the too became very close friends. They were not simply
acquaintances.

They visited each other in their homes.

They

associated with each other in various campus activity groups.
I believe the testimony in the record shows that, at least on
one occasion, Btarsey and Weatherford were co~chairpersons
of an AWARE (froup on' -the campus of the University of South
Carolina.
The record will show further, I think, that Weatherford later married a very close friend, the roommate
Bursey’s wife.

of Mr.

So they were much closer than mere acquaintances,

and we think 'that that is important in. this case.
This association went, on and, of course, Burs ay was
completely without any knowledge that Weatherford was an under-

5
cover agent»

And the two, together with two other persons who

do not really enter this case, except that they participated
in the event, in March of 1970, in order to denonstrata their
opposition to the Vietnam War, afflicted considerable damage to
the personal property and the real property of the Selective
Service office,, the draft board in Columbia, South Carolina»
Admittedly, Strom, the police chief, had been given
prior notice of this crime by Weatherford. Weatherford did
participate with Bursey and two others in the crime. And,
although there were police agents in the building, who had been
placed there in order to either stop the crime or capture the
criminals, were unable to do so; and the four persons escaped.
That was early in the morning hours, I believe, of
March 20, 1970o

Later that

same day, from information

furnished to Chief Strom by his undercover agent Weatherford,
Weatherford and Bursey were arrested on the campus of the
University of South Carolina, charged with the crime of
mallicious destruction of personal and real property.

A

statutory crime under the laws of South Carolina.
Botii were jailed on the same charge, and Weatherford
scon thereafter was released through an arrangement made by
Strom, and Bursey stayed in jail, X believe, for some 12 days
before he was able to put up bond and obtain his release.
Thereafter, and I think the record, is clear on this
from certain testimony, although there was not a specific

6
finding of fact by the trial judge on this particular point,
it was decided, and it was desirable from the State's viewpoint;,
to have the undercover agent Weatherford continue as an under­
cover agent on the University of South Carolina campus, as long
as he could.

Because he was a valuable man, according to the

testimony, and at that time, I believe the testimony is that
he was the only agent, only undercover agent on the University
of South Carolina campus in the employ of SLED*
It would have been impossible, with the very close
relationship between Weatherford and Bursey for Bursey to have
been — to reveal himself, it would have been impossible for
him to do anything unusual without raising very great suspicion,,
And in order to see that "Weatherford was not forced to deal
with Bursey's lawyer, or he was not forced to make, maybe, an
explanation as to why he did not wish to be represented by
Bursey’s lawyer, an explanation that would hardly have been
plausible, the State Solicitor, John W. Foard, arranged —
which was admittedly a false arrangement, for one

for a

local attorney, Frank Taylor* in Columbia, a well-known
attorney, to pose as Weatherford's attorney in this particular
charge.
QUESTION: The State Solicitor, was he a county or
State official?
MR. COLEMAN:

He is a Circuit Solicitor,

and the

particular Circuit he serves has two counties in it. South

7
Carolina has 16 different Circuits, varying in size from two
counties to five.
QUESTION:
MRo

I see»

COLEMAN:

QUESTION:

He was the prosecutor, though?

He was the prosecutor.
He would be like a County Prosecutor or

District Attorney, except his jurisdiction was two counties?
MR. COLEMAN:

That's right.

South Carolina

law,

his title is Solicitor, although it is —
QUESTION:

Ri.ght.

I just wanted to be sure I

understood what his office x^as.
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, sir.

He arranged for this false representation or dummy
representation, however it might be put, by Attorney Taylor, of
4

Weatherford? and that’s admittedly for the purpose of maintain”
ing Weatherford’s cover.
Thereafter, both men went about their normal life,
with the exception — or the inclusion? whichever it might be -of two meetings.

There's some mention of maybe a third meeting,

but no particular testimony with regard to the details.

I

think the testimony, read as a whole, indicates there were two
meetings at which Bursey was present, his attorney, a Mr. Wise
from Greenwood, South Carolina — approximately

70 miles from

Columbia — was present, and of course Weatherford was present.
QUESTION: And Bursey is now out on — released on
bond, pending trial?

8

MRo COLEMAN:

II® was released on appeal bond, yes,

Mro Justice»
QUESTION:

Not appeal bond, is it?

MR. COLEMAN:

No, not, appeal bond, I beg your pardon;

on bond -QUESTION:

Pending trial?

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, sir.

Before trial?
He was on bond, I think it

was $12,500.
QUESTION:

And is Weatherford also purportedly out

on bond?
MR. COLEMAN:

Purportedly out. on bond.

admittedly not a true situation.
QUESTION:

That was

Yes, sir.

Unh-hunh »

MR. COLEMAN: There were two meetings involving the
plaintiff Weatherford -- the plaintiff Bursey.

Weatherford and

Bursey8 s'attorney Wise.
One was at a party at Bursey8s house.
described as an ACLU party.
it was

a social event.

I believe it*s

It makes no difference, except that

And during that course of that social

event, I believe the testimony is that Weatherford and Bursey
and Bursey5s attorney Wise got away from the majority of the
crowd, somewhere out in the field somewhere, and did go into
a discussion of this particular case.
There was a finding of fact by the Circuit Judge that.
Weatherford never did categorically and specifically deny -that

5
he was an agent.

There was, quite naturally, in a case like

this there would be,, and there v?as in this case, a general
discussion between the three as to whether or not an informer
or an undercover agent or something of that nature might be
involved in the case.
There was some discussion by Weatherford of -that,
in response fco discussions by the other two.

Weatherford, I

believe, did state, upon maybe this occasion, maybe another,
but he did state that he would not testify in the case against;
Bursey.
That would normally coma up, because, I think, in
every criminal case involving multiple defendants, there's
always the question of whether one is going to be approached by
the authorities and asked to turn State's evidence in a pleabargaining situation.

And Weatherford denied that -- I think

it was necessary that he do so.

He had to do that, or either

state that he was going to testify.

And had he mad© such an

assertion as that, I am quite sure that his cover would have
disappeared completely and he could no longer have operated as
an undercover agent on the campus.
And I think that's true, whether or not Bursey and
his attorney night have deducted from that fact -that Weatherford
was an agent.

His effectiveness certainly would have dis­

appeared, whether he was an agent or whether he simply was going
to testify, to save his own skin at the trial.

10
I think it's clear that this meeting was without
questi.on arranged by Bursey„

It was not sought out by

Weatherford, not in any degree»
And with the closeness, -the close personal relation­
ship of these two men. it would have been impossible for
Bursey to avoid such occasional contacte as these»
I think, rather than it being against Weatherford,
it*s rather to his credit that he limited such meetings to only
two during -this nearly four-month period between -the time of
the crime and the time of the trial.
On the only other occasion, as I recall the evidence,
that there was a. meeting between the three — teat is, Weather­
ford, Bursey, and Bursey's attorney —» it was on an

occasion

that was brought about entirely by Bursey and his attorney
Wise»
The testimony shows that —- and their own testimony
shows that they came to Columbia without having made prior
arrangements, or even given prior information to Bursey that
they were coming — I mean, to Weatherford, that they were com­
ing.

And went to Weatherford's residence, and he was not there»

They guessed that he might be at the house of a friend of
Weatherford, went there, and, as it turned out, he had h@@n
there and would return very soon, and did retura»
QUESTION:
Coleman, if I may.

Let me interrupt you just a moment, Mr.
I take it you’re going to devote some time

11

fco telling us, or suggesting, that, even assuming that there
were constitutional or other violations, which would have led
to — supported a reversal of the conviction, there is no basis
for a civil action for damages*
HR* COLEMAN:

Yes, sir*

QUESTION; You’re going to get to that?
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, and I will very, very quickly*

I was simply going over these facts, to support really
our first proposition;

that these cireurostances do not

constitute an intrusion at ally that there was no intrusion;
that there was a presence by Weatherford at these two confer­
ences, they were necessary presences*

They were necessitated

by a legitimate State interest of the State, to maintain
Weatherford1 cover, and, of course, his own legitimate interest
to maintain that cover? plus the fact that there was some' fear
in some people’s minds that his life might be endangered if
his cover had been blown at -that point*
Now, the Fourth Circuit does hold, as we read it,
as I read it, that the mere presence of Weatherford at these
attorney™client meetings constituted a per se Sixth Amendment
violation of the effective assistance of counsel»
And the Black and O’Brien cases are cited as
authority for that proposition*

The Copion and Caldwell cases

from the District of Columbia Circuit are cited in support*
We do not agree that Black and O’Brien stand for such

12
a per se proposition»
As far as this particular point is concerned, that
is, the violation of the constitutional right to effective
assistance of counsel, I can't see — although I stand to be
corrected — that it makes a lot of difference whether this
Court sent those cases back simply for a hearing on whether
or not there was damage or prejudice, or whether they sent
them back for a new trial, really, for the same purpose»

I

think it's the same -tiling, in so far as this particular point
is involved»
QUESTION: The only technical difference,as I remember
it, was that the Court, as such, set aside the convictions -and
Mr» Justice Harlan and I would not have don© so, would have
allowed the trial judge to make a determination of whether or
not there was any taint, and allow him, in his discretion, to
set aside the convictions if he . found that there was taint?
but I think you're right to take «MR» COLEMAN:

Prejudice, as I recall it»

Yes, sir»

QUESTION; But, in any event, at most, that was —
even what the Court did, 'was to set aside the convictions and
then, for a determination of how ranch, if any, taint there
had been of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel? isn’t that it?
MR. COLEMAN:

That is - exactly our point»

and O'Brien are simply not support of the -QUESTION s

For any per se rule?

That Black

13

MR» COLEMAN:

Of any per se rule?

yes, sir.

Exactly.
QUESTION:

Because it had been conceded that there

had been electronic surveillance in the one case

do both

cases involve electronic surveillance?
MR. COLEI IAN:

I think one case involved the intrusion

of a police agent of some description, -QUESTION:

Unh-hunh, and the otb.er was electronic

surveillance in one of -the Washington, De C., hotels, isn4fc
that right?
MR. COLEMAN:

I believe that Black — the Black case

involved an electronic surveillance? yes, six*.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. COLEMAN:

And, of course, I think both CopIon

and Caldwell did involve electronic surveillance cases.
We submit, further, that the facts of the CoplonCaldwell cases mid the O'Brien and the Black cases are sc far
different from the facts in this Burs ay case as to make them
in applicable in any event.
In those cases there was a deliberate, admitted,
affirmative intrusion by the government on the attorney“client
relationship.

It x^as certainly not necessitated by any

legitimate government interest, as we -think the case is in
Bursey,
QUESTION:

What's the governmental interest here,

14

in having this man sit down at -the conference between lawyer
and client?
MR. COLEMAN;

Justice Marshall# we do not claim

that as being a legitimate Stats interest.

We simply that the

QUESTION; Well# how do you defend it?
MR. COLEMAN;

V’e say that the maintenance of the

identity of the agent Weatherford# or the maintenance of his
cover# was the legitimate State interest.
QUESTION;

And that5s sufficient to override a

federal constitutional interest?
MR. COLEMAN:

We — well# we think# of course# the

federal constitutional issue is there.

We say that

QUESTION; Well# couldn't they have said that you may
maintain your cover# but just pick a fight with him and say
you don’t want to talk to him any more?
MR. COLEMAN; That# of course# could have been done#
sir,
QUESTION; That's right.

You didn't have to sit

down twice — not once# twice.
MR. COLEMAN;

However# as you say# it is our position

that this was necessary in those circumstances to -~
QUESTION;

Just like putting the spike in the wall

and they called up the hotel was necessary on the Black case.
MR. COLEMAN;

No# sir# I can't agree that, it's

analogous# although I see your point,

15
QUESTION s This is not the only agent that they have
in South Carolina, is it?
MR» COLEMAN:

Not in South Carolina» As I understand

it, however, and I remember -QUESTION:

How long had he been an agent?

MR* COLEMAN:

Oh, short of a year or something like

that»
QUESTION:

Well, there might have been some others

that could have done it»
MR» COLEMAN:

Yes , there could have been another

agent.
QUESTION:

I mean, rather -than to sit through what

you — you admit that it was wrong?
MR, COLEMAN:

I admit that I wouldn91 have done it»

I can*t say it was wrong in those circumstances»
QUESTION;

It!s not wrong for the government to have

a government agent sitting down at a conference between a
lawyer and a client?
MR» COLEMAN:
QUESTION;

Well, letss say, it is immoral?

MR» COLEMAN;
QUESTION:

I cannot say that I feel that that is

Not in those circumstances»

Is it 85dirty pool"?

MR® COLEMAN:

Not in my opinion, in -those

circumstances«
QUESTION s

Is it good?

I wouldn't

consider it good,- no, sir*
I. however, think it's necess ary»
QUESTION:

in between?

MR* COLEMAN;

Yes, sir.

Well, I think it's necessary.

And, unfortunately, of course, -the use of undercover agents is
necessary in police work, I feel.

And I do feel that what was

done in this case was necessary, and it did not and cannot, ba
characterised as the petitioner

I mean as the plaintiff

below, Bursey, has attempted to characterize it, as a deliberate
effort on the part of the State of South Carolina to mislead
Bursey.

It was not that*

It has no — there’s no possible

way that it can be characterized as that, as I can see it»
QUESTION:
point*

Mr. Coleman, I come back to my prior

You’ve used 22 of your 30 minutes, —
MR» COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»

— and you haven’t got to the question of

whether, assuming all these things, there is a damage action
available»
MR* COLEMAN:

Well, the. only case cited by the

Fourth Circuit in support of the rule that there would be a
damage action is the, I believe, via v, Cliff from the Third
Circuit»

And that case is supported ••-is reported in support

of the Fourth Circuit's holding that there can be a 19S3 action,
even though -there might not be provable damage to the defendant.

QUESTION:

„

That case was decided at the district

court level not on tie pangers, not on a motion, but after a
trial, wasn't it?
MR0 COLEMAN: That's correct.» sir»

That's corrects

sir»
QUESTION: And then the judgment was for the defendants»
MR» COLEMAN:

It was for the defendants»

I think,

however, —
QUESTION: And that was reveled by the Court of
Appeals, without —MR, COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe, that's correct»
So there's been no assessment of damages,

or anything like that»
MR» COLEMAN:

No., sir»

I believe that's correct»

In that case, however, the Court, in that case, said
that

what was done there, of course, was not an intrusion

into the client-attorney relationship, it was, I believe, an
action by a prison head and some guards to cut off prematurely
a conference between a murder defendant.1, I believe it was, and
his attorney»
And it was alleged there that that was an unlawful,
unconstitutional interference with the —

QUESTION:

He was a fugitive.

MR, COLEMAN;
after his conviction.

Oh, yes, he did flee the State after —
He put up an appeal bond, and was

released, and thereafter fled the State, and was not appre­
hended for approximately two years.
QUESTION: Then he did come back and serve his

He was apprehended, came back and

served his sentence.

time would have expired then.

I think the appeal

However, he didn’t flee

immediately. There was ample time, and I think the record will
show there’s testimony -that appeal was. disclassed between Mr,
Bursey and. his attorney.

And it was decided by the attorney

that the appeal would be fruitless, and therefore that it
would not be made,

You didn't plead a res' judicate, or

MRo COLEMAN:

The Fourth Circuit indicates that the

other defenses» not originally raised,- would ba — might be
open o
QUESTIONS

Might*,

MR. COLEMAN;
QUESTIONs

It said it was, didn't it?

Yes, I believe so.

Yes„

MR. COLEMAN;

Yes, sir.

I would hope that that is an explanation of our
position on that particular point.
The other big question, of course, with the fair
trial issue, and'the Fourth Circuit ruled, as we understand
it, that the simple neglect or

of the State to inform the

defendant Bursey or his attorney that there was an eye-witness
in the case, which had not been previously known, was sufficient,
in itself, to constitute unfair trial, and a violation of the
constitutional right.

And of course would have supported a

reversal of the conviction.
QUESTION;

Well, I take it, your position, the

State's position, is that the only remedy that Mr. Bursey had
was to take an appeal, and then, perhaps, if he got his
conviction reversed upon these grounds, then he might
conceivably have a different cause of action from the one the
Fourth Circuit has now.
MR. COLEMAN; That is certainly a possibility.

I have

not thought out that process to the point of taking that firm .a

21

position.

Our position? of course that’s No» 1? No. 2 is

that? even if he had — could show a violation now that the
action has been brought? we took the position in the Circuit
Court that it did not state a cause of action.

Of course?

that was overruled by the Circuit Court.
The third issue decided by the Court? which I wish
to get to

very briefly? is 'the liability of Chief Strom as

opposed to that of Weatherford»

It's clear? I think? that

the defendant Strom did not knew that Weatherford was actually
attending conferences between Bursey and his attorney.

He did

know? and he did order? of course? the maintenance of the
cover? and that he was fully aware of the fact that Weatherford
was going about his business and had not revealed these things
to Bursey.
But the record is clear that he did not know that
there was any conference between the attorneys
and his attorney.

Mr. Bursey

And we feel that foe Fourth Circuit was

clearly in error in ruling that he either did know or should
have known it in those circumstances.

We -think the Fourth

Circuit puts the knowledge of Strom on the wrong set of
circumstances.

It puts the knowledge of Strom on the fact

that there was a maintenance of 'the cover? when it's clear
that there was no knowledge on the part of either Strom or
the Solicitor Foard for that matter? that there had been
attorney-client attendances by Weatherford.

Thank you*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Coleman.

Mr. Frey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FREY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
In reading through the briefs of this case and the
opinions below, one is

struck by an almost schizophrenic

character that 'the case has assumed.

It has, in effect,

three different faces.
First is the case described in the findings and
conclusions of the District Court.

Central among them, the

finding that the State’s motive in allowing petitioner
Weatherford to proceed as he did, was to protect his cover so
that he could continue investigations of other matters.
Secondly, that the State initially hoped to make its
case against the respondent without Weatherford9s testimony,
and that the decision to call him as a witness at trial was
a last-minute decision by the prosecutor.
Third, that Weatherford’s role in the conversations
with respondent and his lawyer was limited, involved no
attempt to secure defense strategy information, and entailed
discovery of little that was surprising or highly significant
about respondent’s defense strategy.

23

And fourth * that no information acquired by Weather­
ford during these meetings was conveyed to the prosecutor®
Now, the second case is that perceived by the Court
of Appeals., which accepted virtually all of the facts found
fay the district court, but applied a radically different legal
analysis»
QUESTIONS

Including the facts, those basic facts

you've just stated? ~
MR, FREY s

Yes „

QUESTION:

— those were accepted by the Court of

Appeals, weren’t they?
MR, FREYs

They were all accepted,

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, FREY:

But substituting certain par se require­

ments for the balancing of interest approach that the district
court took.
Now, the third case
in his brief in this Court,

is that painted by respondent
The case of malevolent contrivance

by the State to spy upon and sabotage his defense.
Our position in this case is based essentially on the
facts found by the district court, and our concern in this
case is with the legal principles announced by the Court of
Appeals to govern, those facts „
Accordingly, I will not address at any length the
factual controversies with which this Court is confronted.

24

except, to make two observations in passing.
The first is that it seems to me difficult to
sustain the notion that petitioner’s actions in this case were
motivated to any significant degree by an attempt to

secure

advantage over respondent in his prosecution.
With petitioner Weatherford*s testimony available,
the State’s case was secure. And it’s difficult.to perceive as
a practical natter how the State could have imagined it would
strengthen its case by non-disclosure of Weatherford’s status.
The second point seems to me quite ironic, in light
of respondent’s present posture in this case.

The disclosure

of Weatherford’s status as an agent of the State Police,
far from helping respondent’s defense, was fatal to it.
Respondent’s best hope of acquittal lay in a decision,
by the prosecution to maintain Weatherford's cover past the
trial, rather than to reveal his status by allowing him to
testify.

Had Weatherford done what respondent now insists he

should have don©, the hopes for a successful defense would
simply have been dashed sooner than in fact they were in this

case .
QUESTION:

That is, had he maintained his caver?

MR. FREY:

Had he not maintained — had he not

maintained his cover, and had he said to Bux*sey —

MR® FREY: Now, turning to the legal questions, we
disagree with two central ingredients of the Court of Appeals'
holding®

QUESTION;

leave that:

Let me ask you this, just before you

I read in the briefs that he ultimately, at the

trial, he pretty well

admitted his implication, that is,

Bursey did, the defendant®
MR® FREY:

Yes, he did.

QUESTION:

Did he —- he did not plead guilty, did he?

MR® FREY:

No, he didn't.

He denied the requisite

malliciaus intent that was an element of the offense under the
s fcatufce.
. QUESTION: But did concede his participation in the
episode®
MR. FREY:

Yes, as indeed seemed inevitable in -the

26

face of the prosecution's evidence at that point,,
The first part of the Court of Appeals8 holding to
which we object is the adoption of a per se prohibition upon
contact of any kind between undercover agents or informants
and the defense, even where such contacts come about because
of an effort to maintain an agent's cover»
The second holding to 'which — with which we dis­
agree is the requirement that the prosecution reveal in
advance of trial -the identity of an undercover informant who
it plans to use as a witness-; at trial»
Now, I might say to Justice Marshall, that in our
assessment of the case, we don’t think that Weatherford was
wrong in attending the meeting» We think it would have been
desirable had that been avoidable, and certainly we think it
would have been wrong for him to take any affirmative steps
to insinuate himself into the defense camp»

But, confronted

as he was with anunexpected situation, where respondent's
lawyer asked if he could interview Weatherford, which was the
substance of at least one of the meetings, it seems to me that
given the need to maintain the cover, which the district court
found was the motive in acting here, it was not improper for
Weatherford»
QUESTION?

You see, I have so much difficulty with

this “need to maintain cover'3 which was gotten rid of,
MR» FREY? Well, —

27
QUESTION:

All this need for cover until -they got

■this information, and then, after that, they didn’t need the
cover any longer.

Is that true?

MR. FREY: Well, I don’t think it’s accurate to say
that they got the information.

What is an important part of

the case is that they got — "they” being the prosecution.,
got no information.

QUESTION:

Th® facts are that, one, they wanted to

keep the cover; two, because they wan‘feed to keep the cover,
h© sat down in the meeting between Bursey and the lawyer?
three, that whan it got to time of trial, they decided they
didn’t need the cover.
MR. FRSY:

Those are the facts.

Well, ‘those are some of the facts.

Th®

district, court found that the reason that they didn’t need
the cover, or the reason that they elected to abandon the cover,
which is really what happened, was a fear that the cover had
been blown by independent incidents.
In any event, ‘the decision about the coves: and about
whether to call Weatherford a\ a witness was made by th®
prosecutor, and the findings of the district court are
unequivocal and I think supported by the record that th©
prosecutor was not aware of any of the contacts between
Weatherford and Bursey or Bursey’s attorney, when he made
the decision. These were two independent events.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, what if the government had asked

23

tii© agent on the stand to testify as to what happened at the
meetings between the defendant and his lawyer, and that the
question was — and the information

he wanted was clearly

relevant to guilt?
MR. FREY:

I think that would probably be admissible.

QUESTION: Why?
MR. FREY:

Well, the ■— in terms of our analysis,

there are two ingredients in a possible Sixth Amendment or
due process, X5m not sure what the ground is —- violation for

QUESTION:

Well, you say it* s inadmissible and it has

MR. FREY:

occur?
MR. FREY:
QUESTION;

The constitutional

When the evidence is offered or when

the ~
MR. FREY:
offered.

It would occur when the evidence is

I mean, that was certainly true in Massiah, where

the constitutional violation that was found by the Court
there was not in conducting the further investigati.on of the
offense, but in using, in evidence against the defendant at
trial, his statements made in a period —- pretrial, post-*

29

indictment; and pretrial period.
QUESTIONs But the violation is rooted in sitting
in in the defense counsel.
MR. FREY:

Yesf but it's not — it’s not because

the sitting in is itself a violationi, standing alone,, in our
view? it's because the utilization by the prosecution of any
fruits of that activity would be a violation.
QUESTIONS

That is your fundamental position in this

case* I take it?
MR. FREY:

I think — well* our position is twofold.

QUESTION: That's on© of the -MR. FREY:

There are two —

QUESTION:

That's the end of the case* if you're

right* I suppose.
MR. FREY:

Well* that's not necessarily the end of a

civil case* the point that the Chief Justice made* which I
don't believe was raised in the petition —
QUESTION;

On the unfair trial?

MR. FREY;

That would be the end

that would be

the end of 'the trial? you would have to have a new trial* at
which that evidence was excluded* I think.
QUESTION:

Well* on page 49 of your brief* which is

near the end ~ as you are near the end of your time of
argument — you say that Weatherford's testimony at trial is
not an appropriate source of civil liability.

Are you going to

30

discuss that subject?
MR» FREY;
QUESTION;

Well, that —
The State didn’t seem to be much

interested in it,
MR. FREY:

Well, I had not -- we addressed it in the

brief, because we felt that this was a consideration of which
the Court should be aware in evaluating this case,

I don’t

understand it to have been an issue presented by the Court, or
claims raised by -the State so far in the proceedings.
I am not clear on whether or not the State can raise
it.
Let me just say, and it’s not a matter that is of
central interest to the federal government in this case,

but

it seems to me that whether there is a civil action depends
upon what the violation was.

If the violation was sitting in

the meeting, as in a .Bivens case the violation is the illegal
search and seizure itself, then I think an independent civil
action would lie, regardless of what happened in the criminal
trial.
If, on the other hand, the violation was trialrelated and had to do with the introduction of the evidence
at trial, then, in our view, the defendant’s failure to take
measures that were available to him at that time might; fore­
close his action.
material

It certainly would reduce his damages

31
QUESTION;

When you say "take measures"f you mean

take an appeal from his conviction?
MR. FREY; Well; first object to the introduction of
this evidence- object if it was improper for Weatherford to
testify at the trial.

The defendant could have objected.

Had

the objaction been denied; he could have appealed. And, indeed;
in this case I believe fch© district court found that even after
ha was recaptured; he had post-conviction relief available
under South Carolina law.
QUESTION;

Mr. Frey, unless the violation occurred

at the time of the meeting, why would the agent ever be liable
for what happened at trial?

He was called by the prosecution.

MR. FREY:

We suggest in our brief he would not be.

QUESTION:

He’s called by the prosecution and he’s

under an obligation to testify.
MR. FREY;

Yese we suggest that as long as he gives

truthful testimony^ at least; he’s absolutely immune from
liability.
QUESTION;

Unless there’s a violation at the time

of the meeting.
MR. FREY; Well? yes, that -- for that he would be
liable.

But this is somewhat beside the point that is of •—

points -chat are of central concern to the federal government
in this case.
Nowt we have no doubt that the Constitution affords

32
substantial protactions to 'the confidentiality of relations
between a criminal defendant and his attorney, .and that this
extends to many facets of defense strategy planning» But we
can't agree that this right of confidentiality is so sweeping
as to prohibit virtually any contact between government agents
and the defense, regardless of the government's reasons for
permitting a situation in which such contact comes about,
regardless of the nature of the contact, and regardless of the
impact chat the contact actually has upon the fairness of the
criminal ferial.
So when the Court of Appeals stated that it was of
no consequence, that the intrusion here was not for the
purpose of information but was to maintain Weatherford*s cover,
we thin}:, it tin justifiably slight in important societal interest
in protecting the flow of information about crime to law
enforcement authorities and the safety of undercover

agents

and informants„
Nov/, we’ve argued in 'this case that certain critical
factors must be examined in determining whether a Sixth
Amendment violation has occurred.

The most important of these

is whether the so-called intrusion into defense counsel is
active cr passive.
A violation should be found, in our view, whenever
there’s been a deliberate effort to penetrate the defense camp,,
so that the prosecution may acquire defense strategy informa-

33

tion that can aid it in its adversarial struggle.
This is hopefully a -QUESTION:

What kind of a violation, are you

addressing now?
MR. FREY;

Well, I think that would be the situation,

I think, Caldwell and Hof fa would be -*>QUESTION;

A constitutional violation?

MR. FREY:

A constitutional violation.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY;

I5m a little uneasy about resting it on

the Six ±i Amendment, and I have to hark back to cases like
Herring and even Faretta, where -the Court is somewhat divided
on what the roots of same of these rights are.

But I do think

it would be constitutionally impermissible for the prosection,
in this manner, to invade -die defense camp.
Now, a violation also may occur when tiler© has been
an actual acquisition by the prosecution, by whatever means, of
defense strategy information? and CopIon and Black are examples
of this..
I haven't very much time remaining, but I want to make
a couple of points that have come up in the briefing.
One is fehe notion that the Court of Appeals appeared
to entertain, that the undercover agent is a member of the
prosecution.
this case

I think that notion is wrong in the context of

34

Respondent cites a number of Brady type cases,, and
those are cases where I think the notion of the prosecution
being held responsible for knowledge of the police is far more
appropriate, because those are cases in which what is at stake
is a direct impact on guilt or innocence by the withholding
or -the availability to -the defense of evidence.
Nov?, this is not a case of that sort. And it seems
to me that if the Court can find, in fact, that a barrier has
been established, a quarantine around the agent’s contact with
the attorneys — and that has not been transmitted to the
prosecution in any form that it could be utilized — there
would be no violation.
I also think that the reasons for whatever per s©
rule there may be in Black and even O’Brien don’t extend to
this case.
First of all, there’s a distinction between cases
that involve intrusions and cases that involve prosecution
access to defense information.

And these are cases that are

discussed in respondent’s brief, many Court of Appeals cases,
and I think what on© can distill from these cases is that
where the; prosecution has acquired defense strategy information
and where tills fact has not come out until the trial is ended,
and, therefore, can’t be explored in the context of the criminal
trial itself, the remedy has been to order a new trial.

And

that's what happened in Black at least, and a number of the

35

other cases,,
Mow, on the other hand, where there’s been an
intrusion, but it has not been established that information
has reached the prosecution and that the prosecution may
thereby have gained an unfair advantage in the trial process
itself, there has been not a per se rule, but an inquiry
into prejudice»

We think this is a case on the findings of

the district court where you have the intrusion, perhaps, but
not the unfair prosecutorial advantage that has been gained»
Now, I just want to comment, then, briefly, if I
hav® a minute left, on the second point decided by the Court of
Appeals, which is the duty imposed upon -the prosecution to
disclose the identity of an undercover agent»
Nov/, Brady, which the Court, principally relied on,
is plainly inapplicable.

This is not an exculpatory evidence

case»
The holding of the Court of Appeals in this case
amounts, in our view, and logically can only mean, that any
damaging exculpatory evidence must be produced by the
prosecution in advance of trial»

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McDonald.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUGIILIM MCDONALD, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MCDONALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Counts
I concur in Mr. Coleman1s observation, and I agree
that the district court mad© no direct finding that there was
a need for cover in this case.

And I think that a

review of

the record will conclude independently that, as a factual
matter, there was no need for cover.

And Strom himself

testified on several occasions during the federal trial
precisely to that effect.
The district court judge at one point, asked Chief
Strom whether or not there was anything that Weatherford was
working on that would require the maintenance of his cover,
following Bursey's arrest, and Strom said that there was not.
There was nothing that he was working on.

And Strom, in

response to questions from counsel on cross-examination, stated
that furthermore he was- fundamentally unconcerned about his
agent's cover being blown.

And the reason he was unconcerned

was that he doubted whether Weatherford could be effective
after the arrest, in any event.
There's also a suggestion in the brief of the
Solicitor General that there was some concern about the
agent’s life, or that he might ba done physical injury.

37

Weatherford certainly never indicated that he was in
fear for his life, or that that was the reason his cover was
being maintained.

In point of fact, Strom offered him

protection and Weatherford declined the offer.
And, moreover, had Weatherford’s position as a. law
enforcement agent been truly compromised, then ha never would
have been offered a job by Strom and never would have con­
sidered that he, himself, could have accepted such a job and
still bean an effective law enforcement agent.
QUESTION:

So -—

When is the offer of protection given,

after he tes testified or before?
MR. MCDONALD:

I believe that’s correct, sir.

QUESTION: Which is if?
MR. McDONALD:

After or before?

I think it was after he testified,

Sfcrorn offered to give him a job as a so-called above-the-grour.d
kind of agent, to use Weatherford’s phrase, and he declined.
He decided to pursue graduate studies instead.
But Weatherford himself said that he felt in time he
could be effective as an agent in almost any other capacity.
But Strom's testimony was quite explicit.

There was nothing

that Weatherford was working on.
...

I think the argument really is one of generalized

convenience rather than any demonstrated need, and of course
the district court made no specific finding in that regard.
Not only does the record not substantiate that there

38

was any needy but the record really doesn’t show that Weather­
ford did anything other than what he did in this case that
could be conceived of as a benefit to law enforcement.

There

was, fcr example, evidence in the record that he participated
in vandalism at the Administration Building of the University
of South Carolina, ©vat he went to Atlanta, Georgia —— I can't
conceive why his State law enforcement duties would take him
there? but, nonetheless, he went there to interview about
going to Cuba to check up on radicals, to use his phrase.
But he never made a single arrest as a SLED agent.

He

testified in only one trial, and that was Mr. Bursey’s trial.
And h@ could not remember a single assignment which h© had been
given which led to a conviction, other than Bursey's„
So I think that to the extent ©vat an argument of
law enforcement need is made here, it completely collapses.
But even if -there was a need for cover, I think that the
decisions of this Court clearly indicate that that State
interest, can never b@ exhausted over a defendant’s right to
the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.
One of the reasons that is true is because there are
other less intrusive ways for a State to protect its
legitimate interest in secrecy, if, in fact, it had on®.
One way, as this Court knows, would be simply to
forego prosecution. But Strom himself suggested another way
in which this problem could be solved, and that is, h® simply

39

would have taken his agent off the case.
As a matter of fact, Strom himself conceded that what
had happened in this case was, in his judgment, a violation of
the Constitution, and he also said that it was unethical.
Of course, he said that he didn!t know that the intrusion was
talcing place.
QUESTION:

How, in your view, did the testimony of

Weatherford — just the testimony now, net anything that
preceded it

cause a damage, an actionable damage to him?

MR. MCDONALD: Well, Your Honor, the gist of our
complaint is that there was interference with the right to
counsel prior to trial, and that there was the creation of
surprise —
QUESTION: Well, to what did he testify?
MR. MCDONALD:

Weatherford.

He testified about what was don© at

the Selective Service Board itself.
QUESTION:

Yes, including his being an eye-witness

of the event? was he not?
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

That’s right, sir.

Well, did he testify to any facts which

he learned after the events ~
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

I think the answer --

— that were based in the indictment?

MR. MCDONALD:

The answer is no.

He didn't —

he didn't reveal any attorney-client confidences during the

40

trial of the case.

I think the record doesn't reflect that.

QUESTION: And he didn’t testify falsely, did he?
MR. MCDONALD:

We don't attack his testimony in tills

civil suit, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

He didn’t testify as an eye-witness, he

testified as a fallow participant, didn't he?
MR. MCDONALD:

That’s right, sir — oh, he was a

participant, yes, sir; no — there's no question about that.
And he also participated in the planning of it, as well.
>

QUESTION:

That made him an eye-witness, didn’t it?

MR. McDONALD:
QUESTION:

H© was both. Both, Your Honor.

Mr. McDonald, I have a little trouble with

the surprise theory, because, what difference would have been
made if you had known ten days in advance that he was going to
testify?
MR. McDONALD:

I think one of the differences --

well, for example, he might have had a defense based on
entrapment, had he known that Weatherford was an agent.

As

you recall, there was direct testimony from the Solicitor, as
well as from Weatherford himself, not only that Weatherford
was an agent, but a Mr. Merrick also was an undercover agent.
Solicitor Foard- for example, said that there was another
agent, and there were so many of them that h@ didn't know who
was working for whom? but there was an agent who was unavailable

41

to testify and was out of the country # and there was other
testimony indicating that that person was Hr. Merrick.
So we have a situation where there really were two
agents involved# and I think that Mr. Bursey —
QUESTION2

But why couldn’t he have made that

decision whether to claim entrapment at the close of the
prosecution’s case?

He didn’t have to get on the witness stand

first — the defendant didn't# I mean.
MR. McDONALDi

Well# Your Honor# that’s# of course#

part of the ~ it seems to me — part of the vice in allowing
the State to try a case basically by ambush.

I don't think

that's too strong a phrase.
QUESTION:

There's another thought that runs through

You mean you’d have to — the defendant would not

know whether or not he was entrapped until he heard the
prosecution * s evidence?
MR. MCDONALD:

I think that he wouldn't know if

that defense was available# Your Honor# if he didn't know the
law enforcement agents were his conspirators or his

‘the

persons who had participated with him.
QUESTION;

You want a per se rule that every stool-

pigeon's testimony must be revealed before trial?
MR. MCDONALD:

Your Honor# we argue that a per s©

rule would be applicable in this case# but it's possible for
this Court to affirm the opinion of the Court of Appeals

42
without reaching such a result* because I think there clearly
was constitutional prejudice her®* in that the

stand that Weatherford was hired by Strom and his specific
instructions were to infiltrate certain groups at the
University and to establish contact with certain people.
And one of the people who was specifically mentioned*

Now* h® said that he didn’t point him out* but he

I?

MR® MCDONALD:

That's correct? sir®

He denied that

he had any direct knowledge that the agent was sitting in on
the discussions® But it’s our position that in an action for
19 83? that all we must establish is — or that ha must be held,

After the arrest? his instructions remained -the
same to Weatherford? and that is that he continue his investi­

than that, the Chief knew that Weatherford was still continuing
to investigate Bursey specifically. So he knew that his agent
was doing the vary same things after the arrest as he drd
b®for© the arrest®

And in point of fact, he continued that

instruction® So the Chief knew that Weatherford was
investigating Bursey.

The Chief also knew that an attorney

had been appointed, a sham attorney hud been appointed to

could talk.

MR, MCDONALD:

Your Honor, there are a lot of things

that that’s the —
QUESTION:

Or if# suppose Bursey had been charged

or indicted and. then before trial the case had been dismissed
because the prosecution didn’t ‘think it could win?
MR. MCDONALD:

I think under those cireamstances he

would be entitled to recover for the constitutional violation
which had occurred# in the same way that a person who is the
victim of an unlawful search and seizure# even if there’s no
trial# could bring an action under 1983.
QUESTION: So your theory is that the constitutional

MR» McDONALD:

I think that it does go to a question

of damages.
QUESTION: But the right to counsel depends on the
pendency of a criminal proceeding, doesn't it?

It's not a

instance where the Court found that even though there was no
prejudice or no impact on trial# that, a defendant who had been
denied a constitutional right would still be able to maintain
an action under 1983.
QUESTION:

And in that case the prisoner ~~
But the — well- go ahead; excuse me®

MR® MCDONALD:

that tlie prisoner was incarcerated

and he was denied access to his attorney on two occasions®
After the second occasion# that was brought to the attention
of the Court and there was a recess.
So that as far as the trial is concerned# there was
a curing of that defect.

But# the court said# that# nonetheless#

48

he still had an action for damages for denial of the right
to counsel, and an action under Section 1983.
So I think that would he an instance.
QUESTION:

In other words, he was denied access to

counsel before ferial.
Now, what was denied here before trial, -then?
MR. MCDONALD: Well, fch@ right —
QUESTION:

There's no interference with access

between the client and the lawyer.
MR* McDONALD: We think that you have a right not to
have an agent; for the prosecution sit in on the defense
planning sessions, as h© —
QUESTION;

Even if the defense asks him to sit in?

MR. McDONALD: Well, Your Honor, I think that that
really is a question of semantics more than substance, because
he was there in his role as an undercover agent.

His

specific assignment was to infiltrate the university. And,
more importantly and more specifically, his assignment was to
get information about Bursey.

And he was there because that,

itf&s his assignment.
And even after the arrest, the Chief knew that he
/

was continuing to investigate Bursey, and he continued his
instructions.

So he was there because, he was an agent.

QUESTION:

I understand all that.

MR. McDONALD: And in point of fact that was his

49

testimony st the State court trial.

He had long hair* as

informers do* and he was dressed in the hippie style clothes.
QUESTIONS Wellf i understand all that, but the
right is that, — they have a right* an absolute right* not to
have an informant who is concealing his identity present while
the lawyer and the client are together?
MR. MCDONALD: Wall* I don’t think the Court has to
adopt a per se rule for Bursey to be entitled to relief.
For at least two reasons s

No. 1* there was affirmative

misconduct here* th© rule arguably might be different if the
conduct was truly passive? but we have involved here a
deliberate course of activity on th© prosecution* which I
■think the Court has to be sensitive to because of the special
role of the prosecutor.
QUESTION?

Well* you®re asking

you say we have to

make findings tin© district court did not make* then?
The district court found no affirmative misconduct*
did it?
MR. McDONALDs Well* the district court recited the
facts* but concluded that there was no constitutional viola**
tion. The Court of Appeals found that there was a deliberate
intrusion* and I think th©re clearly was.

And -there also was

the manufacturing of surprise.
I just don’t think that the prosecutor can fc© allowed*
under such cases as Black ledge vs. Parry and other cases in

50
which the Court talks about the prosecutor having an interest
to serve the cause of justice*
I don1 t think that it's tolerable to have him go to
a defendant and says

This is the kind of case that's going

to be presented to you.
These things were volunteered.

Weatherford himself

stated., and it was a li© is what it was, a deception, he said
that he was not: going to testify? he said he was not going to
b© at the trial»
QUESTIONS

Was it an untruth at the time he mad®

the s fcafcemenfc?
MR. MCDONALD:

It was ■—* oh, he knew from the very

beginning. Your Honor, 'that h© would be a witness.

And his

testimony was uncontradicted in that regard.
QUESTION:

I thought it was a change of strategy.

Isn’t there a finding in the district court that they had
originally not intended to call him?
MR. MCDONALD:

I think, Your Honor, that it is

true that the final decision to use Weatherford as a witness
might have been made at fch© day of trial.
QUESTION: Well, then, why did you say a moment ago
that he knew he was going to testify from -fch© beginning?
MR. MCDONALD:

He knew, ha said, that it was always

a possibility that he would be a witness.
QUESTION:

Well, but that isn't quite the same

51
thing as saying he knew„
MR. MCDONALD;

I think, Your Honor, that, he knew
V

that there was a possibility, which is what 1 —
QUESTION;

Well, those aren't the sail® things.

QUESTION;

Mr. McDonald, there's an express finding,

at fch© botton of page 30 on the Petition that "Weatherford
did not know ha would be used as a witness in the criminal
action and Solicitor Foard had not decided, until just prior
to the call of the case, that he would use Weatherford as a
witness."

Do you accept that?
MR. MCDONALD;

Your Honor, I5m not trying to say

anything that's inconsistent with that.

I agree that the final

decision to us© him was made at the day of trial.
But all the parties knew that, it was a possibility
that he would be a witness. Weatherford ‘testified to that
effect, and so did Strom. Strom said -fchat all your so-called
big cases, where you use an undercover agent, it’s simply
implicit that that person at some point may very well be a
witness.

And Strom said;

It's no big deal, you let them

testify, their cover is blown, then you give them a job as
*.

another agent.
So I think that it3s not correct to say that it was
not implied in th@ whole undercover agent —
QUESTION;

But your statement was that he knew all

the time that he would testify.

52
MR. MCDONALD: Well; Your Honor# if I said that, 1
misspoke myself.

What I meant to say is that he knew that

it was a possibility.
QUESTION;

In your brief# among other things# you

say that the prosecution was able to discover the complete
defense strategi7 by these tactics.
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Is there any support in the findings of

the district court for that statement?
MR. MCDONALD:

Well# the Court of Appeals# of course:#

found that Weatherford did have knowledge of the defense
tactics# and I think that -QUESTION:

Any indication in the findings of either

court that the information you refer to was revealed to the
prosecution?
MR. MCDONALD: There is not# Your Honor.

I used the

phrase "prosecution" because the district court found that the
agent — Weatherford was an agent of the prosecution# and it
assumed that# when it uses the phrase — well# when I use the
phrase "prosecution" it presupposes that we assume# as did the
Court of Appeals# that Weatherford is to be regarded# for
purposes of finding a constitutional violation# as a member of
the prosecution.
But# as I say# if w® must prove that the prosecutor
knew about what happened in the defense counsel# then we lose.

53
because we can*t.

Because we depend, in order fco establish

that kind of proof, on what amounts to a confession of wrong­
doing from the parties, that we're assuming, and ,1 think
realistically —
QUESTION:

Mr. McDonald, on© thing pussies me. What

was the defense strategy?
MR. MCDONALD;

Well, Your Honor, they knew that —

well, there were three people who actually participated in the
incident at the Draft Boards
ford.

Merrick and Bursey and Weather­

Weatherford had already ruled himself out.

going to testify.

He was not

As you recall, he said that his benefactor,

Dr. Hardwicke, had insisted that he talk to the police, that
he had gone down to Hilton Head, that he had talked with them,
they wanted him to —
QUESTION:

Well, I just wonder if you could sura it

up in a word. Was the strategy fco deny the incident?
MR0 McDONALD:

I’m sorry.

Honor.

Reasonable doubt, Your
, .

QUESTION;

To plead entrapment, or just inadequate

proof, or what?
MR. MCDONALD:

Inadequate proof and reasonable

doubt. There was no eye-witness.

Merrick was out of town.

He was out of the country, I believe.
QUESTION:

In other words, what was revealed -fco the

prosecution ‘then was that the defense hoped that the government

54
couldn't prove its case?
MR» McDONALDs
QUESTION:

Yes , sir.

Yes.

MR. McDONALDs

That’s what they were going with, they

were going to argue reasonable doubt.
QUESTION: Was there, at the time of the trial, crossexamination of Weatherford as to these roes tings, these two
meetings with counsel?
MR. MCDONALD:
Honor.

Very limited cross-examination, Your

I think that . Mr. Wise alluded to the fact that he

had established contact with various people and he had a lot
of friends in the movement; but I don*t believe there was any
direct examination about the attorney-client meetings.
In fact, ray recollection is that there was not.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. MCDONALD;

In point of fact, I think if you read

the State transcript, you will see how ineffective counsel was
rendered by the surprise, and he, himself, testified that it
totally changed the case, and he felt that his ability to
function as attorney was completely impaired.
I think one can appreciate that.
QUESTION:

Well, just that h@ was met with a much

stronger case for the prosecution than he had anticipated,
because he had not anticipated that an eye-witness would
testify, and one did.

But — and that's always somewhat of a

55

shock to defense counsel.
MR. MCDONALD:
Your Honor.

Yes.

It changed other things, too#

They determined that Mr. Bursey would have to

tak© the stand.

He had — they had ruled that out.

QUESTIONs

Wellf if there's a

very strong case

against th@ defendant# he sometimes feels impelled to take the
stand,, where he wouldn’t otherwise.
MR. MCDONALD2

I think had he known about that in

advance -- of course# preparation is a benefit# and had h@
known about -that prior to the trial he might have been more
effective.
QUESTION:

Did you ask for a continuance on that

basis?
MR. McDONALD:
QUESTION:

No# ha did not.

No# he did not.

In your specific claim of constitutional

violation by sitting in on the meetings# is it trial strategy#
learning trial strategy# or is it learning confidential -*• or
sitting in on confidential communications between the attorney
and the client?
MR, McDONALD: Well# I think there are a lot of
vices inherent in sitting —
QUESTION: Well# which is it here?
MR. McDONALD;
strategy.

It would be

Well# here it’s learning defense
of course# Weatherford already knew

the incriminating evidence? but that could be involved# or

56

people might be concerned about evidence of other crimes.
Or —
QUESTION: Well*, doesn’t it make a little bit of a
difference which you’re claiming as to whether the —■ whether
the violation occurs at the trial or when you’re sitting in
on the meetings?
MR* McDQNALD:

Well, I think Your Honor is getting

around again to the question of res judicata and collateral
estoppel»
QUESTION:

No, I'm not at all®

I’m not at all,

I’rn just wondering when the ~~ what the constitutional
violation is and when it occurred»
MR» MCDONALD:

well, there are different kinds of

harm that could result* The harm here was twofold*

It was

that the defense strategy was captured, and it could have
been — well, it was relayed to at least a member of the
prosecution. We did not prove that that defense strategy had
actually been relayed to the prosecutor, but it’s clear that
knowledge of an opponent’s tactics give a person quite an
advantage in an adversarial situation*
ThatEs one of the —
QUESTION:

Well, what if, at the time he was

sitting in, they were also planning another crime?

I think that would be — would b@

MR. MCDONALD: Well, the —
QUESTION: Well, would there b© a constitutional
violation at that time?
MR. MCDONALD:

I don!t know that the right to plan

crimes is constitutionally protected, in the sens© that the
right to plan a defense is constitutionally protected.

That

would be —
QUESTION:

So you 'would suggest there wasn’t any

violation there of a third party, a government agent, sitting
in on those kinds of conversations?
MR. MCDONALD:

Well, like — it was sort of a

roughly analogous situation was involved in the Hoffa case.
The Court there
QUESTION: Well, I take it, under your position, there
would have been a

1983 violation in the Hoffa case?

MR. MCDONALD: Well, of course, that involved the
United States Government there, but the Court did —
QUESTION:

Well, all right, but it would be a

constitutional violation, you say, —
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

The Court didn't rule —-

— of a Sixth Amendment right to counsel?

MR. McDONALD:

Had the State been the prosecuting

party there, it may well have been that Mr. Hoffa could have
had an action under 1983 for what happened —

50

QUESTION:

Well# I know, but doss — the Federal

government is# and if it's a violation of the Sixth Amendment,
there might be a Bivens type of action.
MR. MCDONALD:

W© certainly don't rule out that

possibility# Your Honor? perhaps there could have bean.
QUESTION: Well# your theory seams to reach that in
the Hoffa case.
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.

That at the time the agent was sitting

in on conversations between lawyer and client# there was a
violation.
MR. McDONALDs

Right# sir.

And if the ~~ there would

be a violation for the intrusion that occurred at the cas© at
which it occurred, rather, than a case or a prosecution which
would grow out of the criminal activity which might have been
discussed.

And I think Hoffa involves that#

the duality

situation that clearly suggests that had Hof fa been convicted
at his trial that he would have had grounds to set aside that
conviction on the grounds of intrusion? and I assume that he
would also have a 1983 action.
Th® Solicitor General has raised an issue involving
the general use of informers and has suggested that if the
opinion of the Court of Appeals is to be affirmed in this case#
that it would provide a so-called fail-safe method for
detecting informers. We responded tc that in our brief# but

59

let ms simply add to that.
to testimony by Strom.

1 direct the Court*s attention

He indicated that the ruling ©f the

Fourth Circuit — or he testified that the present practice
in South Carolina was not to allow undercover agents to
participate in defense strategy sessions.
He claimed that it happened in this case because he
was ignorant of it* but he was quite pointed in his testimony
that h© simply would not permit one of his agen-ts to partici­
pate in defense consultations* and he didn*t qualify his
remark in the-way that such instructions are qualified*
apparently* which are given to the FBI.
He stated that informer participation in defense
strategy sessions wouldn't h® ethical* it wouldn’t be legal*
so that it does not appear that the ruling of the Fourth
Circuit varies in any way what the present practice of the
stated practice is in South Carolina.
I think this fail-safe argument also overlooks the
fact that a person would declina an invitation to participate
in defense planning sessions for a number of reasons* and some
of them would have nothing to do with the fact that that parson
was an agent.
QUESTION;

Mr. McDonald* let me just interrupt once

more* if I may,
MR. MCDONALD:

Yes* sir.

QUESTION: What is the authority or the closest

60

authority for the proposition that -there is some kind of
protection, either constitutional or otherwise, for a, quote,
"defensa strategy session", unquote, other than a session at
which only the attorney and the client were present?

I mean,

we don‘t have a normal privilege situation» But where is the
source for this notion of a broad, you know, a broad grouping
that's also protected?
MR» McDOUhLD:

I think there are a number of cases,

Your Honor, which establish that proposition»

Hoffs, for

example, assumed that Caldwell and CopIon had been correctly
decided» And in Copion, th® Court there articulated a right
of a defendant to have an unsurveilled defense planning
relationship with an attorney.
QUESTION:

I think that —-

Is this about a third person present,

between the defendant and the attorney, as well?
MR» MCDONALD: Well, of course, those cases involved
electronic surveillances but I think -the Court can take —
QUESTION:

Right, so those are intrusions on the

privacy of toe attorney and the client.
MR. MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

That's right.

I'm just wondering about intrusions on

th® non-privacy of to© attorney, the client and toe third
party. Are there any such cases?
MR. MCDONALD:

I’m asking you what cases are ‘there that involve a
three-party situation;

an attorney, a client and a third

party? and then someone else intrudes or — what is the source
of the notion that that relationship is protected?
MR. MCDONALD: Well, I think that it would be
protected by the notion -that the right to confer with an
attorney includes the notion to prepare a defense. And
preparation of defense, it seems to me, --QUESTION; Well, I'm not asking you about the
theory.

Are there cases that establish this general notion,

that’s what I'm trying to get,
MR, MCDONALD:

Well, there are two cases, Your Honor-,

we cited in our brief involving the attorney-client privilege,
which say that communications made between joint defendants and
attorneys is protected by the attorney-client privilege?
and I should think that the scops of the protection afforded
by the Sixth Amendment would not b® less than that, ,
QUESTION:

Let me put it to you this way: Suppose

there were two people sitting in on the defense — these same
meetings, one was the government agent and the other

one was

not a government agent at the time, and never was a government,

62

agent, except that the government heard that he was sitting in
and he agreed to testify# and they offered his testimony at
the ferial?
MR. MCDONALD; Wall * the Sixth Amendment violation
wouldn’t exist in that circumstance# —
QUESTION: All right. And then they — and you donJt
think that th© information# that the testimony of that non­
agent would be excludable?
MR. MCDONALD:

If h© acted without any State

informant whatsoever. I —
QUESTION: Without any — postulate all you want.
There was no connection with the government.
MR. MCDONALD: All right# sir.
QUESTION:

Then they call the agent at the same

trial.
MR. MCDONALD:

The Sixth Amendment does apply against

the government# I think is the answer t& that.

MRe MCDONALD:
QUESTION:

Well, of course, that’s *—

You had two extra people in the meeting

besides the client and -the lawyer*
MR* MCDONALD:

The court might conclude that there

had been, you know- a deliberate waiver or that there was no
attorney-client meeting to intrude, or that there had been no
intrusion, that that was a meeting that was open to the public,
that there had been a complete publication of the strategy?
and those considerations might call for a differant result
than the on© we think is appropriate her®, where there was
prosecutorial misconduct, there was deliberate intrusion, as
the Fourth Circuit found, and there was also substantial
interference with the right to prepare for the trial*

QUESTION :

But; you would have been, no less

surprised, would you?
MR, MCDONALD?

No, I think we would have been much

less surprised, because what the government did her© it
deliberately ruled out the vary case which it. presented? had
t

they not done -that, had Weatherford not deliberately said
that he was not going to be there, when he knew there was a
possibility that he could be there? had he not done that,
then the defense could not have ruled out the possibility of
his tes tiraony.
But because of the very specific misrepresentations
which he made, the very case -that was presented was the one
case which had been completely ruled out.
