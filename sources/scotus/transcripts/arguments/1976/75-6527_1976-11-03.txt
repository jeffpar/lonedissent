MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will resume with the

arguments in Ho. 75-6527.
Mr. Howard# you have 22 minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK ho HOWARD# JR.. ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS — Resumed
MR. HOWARD:

Mr. Chief Justice# may it please 'the

Court:
When the Court recessed yesterday I was attempting
to answer Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question# which I understood to
be whether civilly committed institutional inmates were within
the reach of the Eighth Amendment.
I would like to try to arrive at the answer by
explaining our theory of the reach of the Eighth Amendment*
and why# under ..that theory, derived from this Court’s
decisions# my answer to the question would have to be no.
This Court’s decisions have never# in my reading#
departed from the historic intent or the literal text of the
Amendment# which is internally consistent.

It speaks of

excessive fines# excessive bails# and cruel and unusual punish™

men to
The Amendment# as we read the Court's decisions# only
speaks to punishments which are inflicted consequential to or
collateral to the criminal process of law. Corporal punishment
in the schools# in our view* is no part of the criminal process

28
by any view»
nature.

It is civil and correctional, therapeutic in

It is not within the criminal concept at all.
The history of the Eighth Amendment has been explained

too often for me to try to bore the Court with it.

It

originated from the imposition of inhumane sentences by the
English courts.

Its interpretation by this Court's decisions

has uniformly been in the criminal context.

In fact, the Court

has rejected its application in civil cases, in such cases as
deportation- the Fong Yu© Ting case, and iri a case involving
incarceration for civil contempt, this Court has rejected the
Eighth Amendment as applicable there to give relief,
The clearest illustration, we believe, is in the case
which is heavily relied upon by the petitioners, and that is
Trap vs,.Dulles,
The distinction can b© seen by comparing Trop with its
companion case, which was decided by -this Court on the same day
in IS!!, Perez vs, Brownell»

The Nationality Act of 1940 in

Perez stripped Mr, Perez of his citizenship because he voted in
vi foreign election.

He was — there was no criminal conviction,

there was no criminal process.

The Court sustained that de­

na tionalizaticn.
In Trop, Mr, Trop had been found guilty by court
martial of wartime desertion, and the statute there imposed
denationalization as e consequence of that conviction.

And

Chief Justice Warren, in his opinion, as we read the opinion,

29
only came

■ o

the question, of the

that there was a conviction, the
that criminal consequence»

Eighth Amendment after finding
Eighth Amendment was invoked by

He then proceeded to the famous

language about penal — the distinction between penal and
non-penal statutes, that the government can’t label something
non-penal when it really i3 penal.
In our view , that is a secondary test.

The threshold

test is always whether there is a criminal process, link or
nexus.

If there is found such a

connection,, then the question

is whether the punishment is penal.

And if it is

found to be

penal, then the question is , is it cruel and unusual?
And the Court has certainly expanded the definition
of the term “cruel and unusual".

nav-sr expm ^>1 fchf.

But we submit that it has

basic definition of punishment.

So, unless there is punishment in the Eighth Amendment
sense, the'Amendment does not apply.
And that brings me to the cases in the lower courts,
which have departed from this standard that I’m suggesting.
The prison cases are the bast example, and the most famous
prison case is that decision written by Mr. Justice Blackmun
while on the Court of Appeals, Jackson vs. Bishop, in which the
flogging of prisoners in Arkansas Penitentiary was prohibited
as violative of the Eighth Amendment.
Other cases have applied it to juvenile institutions.
HeIson vs, Heyne in the Seventh Circuit dealt with a juvenile

30
institution where there were criminal and non-criminal youngsters
in the institution»

But it gave no analysis to what we see to

be the threshold issue»
QUESTION:

Mr. Howard, could I interrupt?

MR. HOWARDi

Sure.

»

QUESTION:

I can’t remember whether yesterday you

answered Mr. Justice Blackmun1 s question about two persons in
the- same institution, one there as a result of conviction for
a crime and the other is a finding of mental illness,, and the
same punishment being meted out to both.

Was. it your answer

that one would have an Eighth Amendment claim and the other
would not?
MR. HOWARD:

Yes, sir.

I was really trying, in a

long-winded way, to get to that answer now by explaining our
theory.

My answer would he. yes, that under the rigorous

analysis of this Court’s decisions, the mental, civilly committed
monfct-1 patient would *:ot have the benefit of the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

But would your analysis be the same if

both of them — if the person inflicting -the discipline said
in words, "This is punishment" and was in effect punishing the
man for a crime in both situations?
MR. HOWARD;

I think it would be the same, Mr» Justice.

Again, I see it as a question of the contours of the Eighth
Amendment.

And what I see to be a blurring of those, contours

by lower treatment so far, which has not examined this problem.

31
Host of the. cases involving mixed institutional
custody have not stated why the Eighth Amendment is invoked,
they have assumed that it’s been invokedQUESTION*

I was wondering if one could reconcile the

cases you described, about tie loss of citizenship, by simply
saying that in one case it was punishment and the other case it
was not, rather than saying in one case there was a criminal
process and in fine other there was not.

Wouldn’t the opinions

be consistent with that rather simple approach?
Is there any language in -the opinions that would b©
inconsistent with -chat rather simple approach?

Let me put it

that way.
MR. HOWARD;

Well, I find it difficult to see the

analogy, Mr. Justice Stevens - because in the Peres; and Trop
cases, the end result was exactly the same.

And the only

distinction that I can see between taking away — restoring
Mr, Trop' s citizenship when he was convicted of wartime
desertion and taking it away from Mr. Perez when he voted in a
foreign election was the Chief Justice5s lead in the opinion
by discussing punishment as a consequence of crime,
QUESTION; Well, why couldn’t one just simply say
punishment and forget the "as a consequence of crime"?
not the same distinction apply?

Would

That’s really my problem.

MR. HOWARD;

No, sir, —

QUESTION;

Decause in the loss of citizenship

32

situation, it clearly was -- I mean, in the consequence of
wartime desertion, it was clearly punishment®

And it would

seem to me if that had been done by Executive Order or by some
other procedure other than as a result of crime, one could
consistently with the opinion still call it punishment covered
by the. Eighth Amendment®
I'm not quite sure, why one could not do that®
QUESTION;

Well, it followed a court martial

conviction for a criminal offense, didn't it?

MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION;
MR, HOWARD;

Yes, it clearly did®
And only that,
And I believe that was Chief Justice

Warren's basis for reaching the Eighth Amendment®

He didn't

articulate the reasoning that I'm urging to the Court here®
QUESTION;

Well, that's my point®

The opinion does

iot articulate the rationale when you find in the opinion?
MR. HOWARD:

Not in so many words.

But I think it

must — I think the rationale is there and has to be
recognized.
QUESTION;

Mr. Howard, on your 'two men in the mental

institution, how do you gat around the Screws case?
MR. HOWARD;

Sir, I ~

QUESTIONs They were both

both of them were

incarcerated.

I5.R, HOWARD:

r c, sir, I would not accept that.

I

33

would say that -=—
QUESTION;
man and said:

And you come to the Assembly Committee

You did something wrong# you spit on the floor#

and so 19m going to deny you your rights# and I'm going to beat
the daylights out of you to punish you,
MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION;
MR. HOWARD:

Mr. Justice# I —
Isn't that Screws?
No# I don't think -they are the same.

I think that the courts have found — have had a solicitude
for institutional cases# and it’s perfectly understandable.
When a man's or a child's liberty is taken away from him and
he is put into an institution and he5s isolated from the
community and ho cant go home to his parents at night# and

he's subjected to inhuman© conditions in that institution# then
the courts have found that the conditions demand a remedy.
I would suggest, chat the Fourteenth Amendment would be
more appropriate as remedy in those situations than the Eighth
Amendment.

And a few courts have drawn feat distinction#

between prisoners either in jail or in a reformatory as a
result of a criminal act# and inmates there either because of
mental incompetence or because they are pretrial detainees.
It seems to me that for a detainee or a mental patient to
suffer inhumane treatment or conditions is so irrational# is
so unrelated to a State objective that he could challenge that
trerternt bcsed on fine- Fourteenth Amendment

34

QUESTION?

You say it's only not clearly a violation

of -the Eighth Amendment, you're not saying it could be a
violation of ‘the Fourteenth?
MR. HOWARD:

I'm not saying that there could not be

a remedy? and of course if we take it to this case, that is
tiie issue that is not before the Court today.
Trier© was a third question presented in the petition
for certiorari which would have brought a substantive due process
issue her®.

The Court did not accept that, and of course neither

of us hate briefed it, and I would not want to make any
concessions on it.
But that's a possibility.
QUESTION:

But th© point, as I understand it, is

that the Screws case involved.a deprivation of life without
due process of lax?, and did not involve th© Eighth Amendment as
such; is that it?
MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It —

I defer to the expert who argued the

Screws case, but — .
[Laughter.]
MR. HOWARD: Ihe Screws case, of course, was a criminal
case, and it required specific intent, but I think this gets
us back to the case that was argued yesterday about the right
-that has to be found, if there’s to be a deprivation.
QUESTION:

And —

Mr. Howard, could I interrupt again?

35
It seems fca me we may just be arguing what
constitutional basis there would be for the kind of review the
plaintiffs seek in this case, because# if I understand you
correctly# you're saying that if the student is given a fair
hearing# say they have a full trial on whatever the charge
against him is# and a fair procedure to determine his guilt#
and then# as a result of that# they impose a punishment# say#
they decide this offense justifies locking him in the basement
for four days, or something# in the basement of the school#
without bread or water, anything.

I think you're saying as

a mattor of substantive due process that would be intolerable#
even though it might not violate the Eighth Amendment.

And#

if so# what difference does it really make?
Because isn*t your test still going to be one of is
it such an extremely severe penalty as related to the offense
that it's not constitutionally tolerable?
MR. HOWARD:
questions there.

Mr. Justice# I think there are several

X don't wish to concede that there is a

Fourteenth Amendment substantive remedy here# because we really
haven't examined or briefed it? and certainly X don’t concede
that procedural due process steps are required in every case*
QUESTION:

No# but X?m assuming we give the

procedural due process to gat that aspect out of the question#
that’s all.
HR. HOWARD:

And then a heavy punishment as a result

36
of —
QUESTION:

Say you lock a five-ye a r- o 1 d or savan-

year-old boy in the basement for ten days.

Could a school do

that? provided it gave him an adequate hearing?

Would -the

Constitution 'tolerate that?
I think your position is either yes, or it has to be
under some provision tinder other than the Eighth Amendment,,
MR. HOWARD:

Certainly the schools can1

do it,

my first position would be that there ar® adequate enough State
remedies, and no reason to suspect that -those remedies aren’t
been enforced, that there is no clear call for federal —
QUESTION:

Than how can you acknowledge the State

right to do that, and yet question the hypothetical case about

the inmat© in a manual institution who is given an unusually
.■•severe discipline?

What’s the difference in constitutional

terras?
MR. HOWARD:

Well, I may be driven to the point of

relying — falling back on the Fourteenth Amendment.

I find

it difficult to say that a student who suffers truly excessive
punishment can’t, have any remedy. But, I —
QUESTION: Do you prefer to have us find it as a
matter or substantive due process, rather than apply the
Eighth Amendment?

That seems to be —

MR. HOWARD:

I would prefer, Mr. Justice, that it

come to you in an. appropriate case so that the question can. be

37
examined very carefully.
QUESTION?

I wish only to ~-

Well, isn't that the very issue here,

whether, no matter how severe the punishment, there is any
constitutional remedy, based on the facts alleged here?
Maybe he has proceeded under the wrong theory, but do you still
deny him any relief?
MR. HOWARDz Well, the only issue that the Court faces
here, with respect to severe punishment, is whether the
Eighth Amendment reaches it.
was a part of the case below.

It was -™ the Fourteenth Amendment
The Fifth circuit, for example,

rejected an examination case-hy-case of the punishments
inflicted in this case, and I think, at least partly, oh the
theory that it gets the federal courts squarely into the
business of second-guessing school administrators as to whether
corporal punishment was necessary? and, if it was, then whether
two licks or swats or five licks was appropriate in each case.
And I think the Fifth Circuit held that that was
not an appropriate function of the federal courts, and I would
refer to your language in Bishop vs. Wood, the case involving
the dismissal of the city employee, in which you made the
point, that fch© federal courts are not the appropriate forums
to pass on daily multitudinous decisions which are handed down
every day in public agencies.
QUESTIONs

And which do nest affect the litigant's

constitutional rights.

But here I'm troubled by the — the

38
problem it. seems

the underlying problem here is whether the

Constitution protects an individual from being imprisoned
indefinitely by a school., if that's the course the school
chooses to punish him.
QUESTION:

But here there's no imprisonment? there

was no deprivation of liberty? was there?
QUESTION:

No? but in principle it’s -the same tiling#

MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

No# sir.
~~ it seems to me.

QUESTION:

But not on the Constitution# which#

under the Fourteenth Amendment# talks about life# liberty or
property.

And her© there was no deprivation of any of the

three # was there?
MR. HOWARD:

No# there was not. And I — the ordinary

case# of course, involves a temporary detention and no
deprivation of liberty.
QUESTION:

No# but the point would be the only

constitutional protection against the deprivation of liberty

is to have the. procedural due process precede it. And I’m
assuming that the deprivation of liberty that I described was
made only after a fair and full trial ascertaining guilt.
The question is# is there then any limit on the
punishment the State can impose on the student for his
infraction of a school rule?
there's no limit.

And apparently your position is

Unless it’s substantive to some kind of

39

substantive due process.
MR. HOWARD?

I find ifc very difficult fco take the

extreme position that you put me in, Mr. Justice, and I only
say again that 1 would urge the Court —
QUESTIONS
Circuit opinion?

Isn’t that the problem with the Fifth

We don’t have to review every time a student

gets slapped, in order fco avoid the constitutional extreme
that the Fifth Circuit, has reached. That's the only suggestion
I’m making.
MR. HOWARD:

Well, it may have fco do also with this

dilemma of what right in 'the Constitution is secured.
New, if the Eighth Amendment doesn’t cover it, does
the Fourteenth Amendment,, by its own force and effect, provide

that right —
QUESTIONS Well, that question was presented in the
petition, was it not, arid cert was not granted on that issue?
MR. HOWARDS

It was not granted, Your Honor, and that

QUESTION5

We limited the grant to questions one

is why

and two in the petition?
MR. HOWARD;

Yes, sir.

I'm urging the Court not to rush to judgment on this,
unless the case comes fco you with full briefs and argument,
because —•
QUESTION;

What would be along the line is if the

40
teacher struck this child out on the street? that would be
assaufcl and battery - wouldn't it?
MR. HOWARD:

Yes, sir.

And —

QUESTION: But merely because it’s in the school? that
takes it out of assault and battery.
MR. HOWARD: Well? I don't think it does? I think that
these are essentially? as the Fifth Circuit stated? tort claims.
The Constitution doesn’t provide a remedy for every wrong?
and Section 19 83? as Paul vs. Davis teaches us?
QUESTION:

Well? assault and battery is obviously a

State, it’s not a federal.
MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

Yea? sir.
That’s what I'm talking about.

MR. HOWARD:

One of the judges on the Court of Appeals

asked counsel during the arguments

Isn't this an attempt to

use a constitutional canon to kill a Florida — do away with a
Florida f lyspeck?

And it seems to me that that was an apt

question.
If I might turn to the due process issue? the -- I
understood Mr. Rogov; yesterday to cor»cede, the point that we
make in our brief? and that is that the true issue here is
whether procedural due process steps are required before, the
administration of any punishment, not just severe.

And I was

prepared to quarrel with his definition? but I don't believe
I have to

41

This theory has been rejected by all courts which have
considered it, with the exception of Baker vs« 0wen, in which
this Court held that parental objection may not overrule the
administrator’s discretion» Th© Court did not review the
question of procedural due process, so it was not a precedent
there.
The Baker Court found a few steps to be necessary,
■and there is one unreported case from Georgia, which is cited
in the briefs, which also required it,
Goss vs, Lopes is the starting point, we believe, here,
and ill© Goss case,- as we see it, was predicated upon the
deprivation of th© right to education, in that suspensions,
at least, took the child out of school, away from the education
which the State had guaranteed to give him.
Corporal punishment, in contrast, is correction while
keeping the child in school.

The purpose of corporal punish­

ment as a disciplinary alternative is to correct the child
quickly while putting him back to class.
The record here at least shows 'that there was no
retardation of progress of any of the children.

The numerous

citations are collected and briefed to the record, these
students progressed fairly normally on through school. They
suffered no reputational harm, and therais no showing that
future schooling or future employment was jeopardized.
So, in so far as th® first inquiry, whether there is

42

a protected interest? the State of Florida guarantees children
the right fee- an education# but it doesn't guarantee them the
right to go to public school with immunity from corporal
punishment in case of misconduct»
The petitioners have sought to find a secured right
in the Fourth Amendment? for which there is no case support at
all, and it was never argued below» The Fifth Circuit didn't
even deal with this question.
Mr. Rogow suggests the penumbra theory, and I don’t
know how far that goes or what it covers»
Further, 1 think, in his most strongest reliance, is
on some generalized liberty interest.
there is no deprivation of liberty.

We say first that
The Constitution says that

liberty shall not be deprived or taken away. And corporal
punishment in the normal situation — and-that's what we're
talking about — is a temporary detention only for correctional
purposes.
The student’s liberty interest is just one ingredient
in a balance of interests which has been reached by tee States
and by almost all of tee States.

State policy and history in

this country favor local educators * discretion and control in
these sorts of decisions, and provide remedies when that
discretion is abused.
So w® submit that there is no call for a federal
mold which is going to be frightening to administrators, probably

43
self-defeating, in terms of the use of this remedy , because
educators don1t look upon rules of the Supreme Court, even if
they are called informal, they don’t look upon them as informal,
they are mindful of Wood vs, Strickland, the personal liability
problem»
My tiros is up, and I thank th© Court»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Howard.

Mr. Rogov/, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S, ROGOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROGOW:

I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
As I understand Mr. Howard’s argument, it boils down
to the fact that tha Constitution can ban the flogging of
prisoners, but it cannot ban th® flogging of students.
We don’t think that that ■*-“
QUESTION:

Well, in his argument he was limiting

his remarks to the Eighth Amendment, was he not?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, and so am I at this point, Mr.

Justice White. And I want to reiterate to the Court -that there
are two separate and distinct issues in this case.
In the Eighth Amendment context, the argument is that
this punishment is civil in nature, and not criminal, and
therefore some distinction can be drawn on that basis.
is merely a label of convenience.

That

44
The factor to be looked at is whether or not it is
punishment, irrespective of who is meting out that punishment#
And Trop vs# Dulles and Perez vs# Brownell, when one
reads them, I think sees that the focus is upon punishment, not
punishment for a crime, but whether or not there was punishment
involved#
And the Court found in Perez that stripping a person
of his nationality was not punishment#

What it was was an

exercise of the international affairs power of Congress, saying
that if someone voted in a foreign election, then, because we
had to show the foreign country that we were not interfering in
their business, we would strip a person of his nationality#
But it was not at all, looking at that, as punishment#
In Trop, it was punishment# And so the focus is
upon punishment.

We think that’s an important •—

QUESTIONs

Well, what you’re saying.is it was

precisely the same thing in both Trop and in Perez, i.e,, the
deprivation of citizenship, and the reason it was punishment
in the one case, in Ttop, and not punishment in Perez is, what
1 had understood, or one could understand, was that in Trop
it followed a conviction of a criminal offense.

And isn't

that what made it punishment?
MR. ROGOWs

No, I don't say —

ONKSTICN:

If was pare, of the sanction imposed

upon one convicted of a criminal offense. And in the other

45

cassa it was

there was no criminal proceeding whatsoever.

Now, isn’t that what made the same consequence,
punishment in the one case and not punishment in the other?
MR. R0G0V7:
1 read it.

No, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Hot the way

And when one reads Perea carefully, one notes that

the original law which stripped a person of his nationality,
which was a civil — a law passed during the Civil War, involved
no desertion conviction at all.

The historical basis for

Trop and Peras was an old statute that said, if you served —
\

or if you deserted, whether or not you were convicted or not,
you would ba stripped of your nationality.
I think the focus is upon punishment, not ~
QUESTION:

Wall, why was it punishment in the one

cass and not in the other?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOV?;

Because —
In the precise same thing.
Because, in Perez, it was not punishment

because Congress was exercising a specific power that it had,
not to planish a. person, but to protect the country. And I think
when one reads Peres carefully, that that is a conclusion that
on® comes to»
That is the basis for the distinction.

But I don’t

think it. makes very much difference in our case, quite
frankly, and I don’t

MR. ROGOWs
QUESTION;

If It’s to —
—

because Congress is exercising a

specific power?
MR. ROGOW;

If it's a legitimate exercise of that

power, which it was in Peras, and there is a legitimate
governmental interest that was being protected, and the Court
found that in Perez, then ~~
QUESTION: But I thought the only cruel and unusual
punishment clause

vjss

a barrier to what would otherwise be a

quite sweeping exercise of congressional power; that you have
the power to regulate interstate commerce almost any way you
want to, except when you run up against a specific prohibition
in the Bill of Rights.
Are you saying that that is not the case?
MR. ROGOW;

No, I'm not saying that is not the case.

But I'm saying that the first question that must be addressed
is whether or not the intent of Congress, in inflicting some
kind of sanction upon a person, is to punish.
QUESTION: Well, the source of congressional power is
not really relevant here.

Is it?

So long as it’s -- one might

inquire upon whether or not it was an appropriate exercise of

47

power granted by tha Constitution to the Federal Legislature?
but once one found an affirmative answer to that * then the
question is:

Did Congress enact a criminal law or a civil

law?
Congress has enacted many criminal laws under its
commerce power.

The Dyer Act, the Mann Act, and many, many

others«
Mow, I suppose — audit has enacted, as we both know,
many, many kinds of civil legislation under its commerce power.
But the question is not the source of Congressional
power, but whether or not this is what has been created as a
criminal offense, followable by a criminal sanction.

If so,

it's punishment? and if it’s not, it’s not.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

I — where we —
Isn’t it?

In other words, if under the
MR. ROGOW:

•— where we disagree, Mr. Justice

Stewart, is that I don't think that the criminal aspect is
important. The punishment aspect is important.
But, as I say, Trop and Perez are not essential to
our case at all.

Because we come down to --

Mr. Rogow, in Perez, was there any rule

MR. ROGOW:

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTION;

followed only upon conviction of a criminal offense.

I’m not

talking about its predecessor in the Civil War, I’m talking
about the law involved in Drop? isn't that correct?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did.
Not upon the fact of desertion,

MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION;

No.
-** bi\t upon a conviction of a criminal

offense.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

All I am saying is that the focus is punishment, and
is it p unishnent*

If it’s punishment, no matter who metes it

49

out, it can folate the Eighth Amendment»
QUESTION:

But isn't that — isn't it of some

substance in arguing, making your punishment argument,, that
whatever happens to him follows upon the breach — supposedly
follows upon a breach of a rule,of an

official rule?

MR. ROGGW: And that's exactly what happened in this
situation.
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOW:

Well, that's what I — yes , I understand.
There are breaches of official rules, and

then punishment is imposed.
QUESTION:

But if it is limited to punishment, what

happens if the principal tells a teacher;

"You’ve been late

three days this week, give me a rule and I'll whack you one"?
Is

that

a violation of the Eighth Amendment?

MR. ROGOW;

No, because —- and we have never said

that one whack is a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The
question is whether or not there is

some opportunity for a

hearing before authorized punishment can be used.
QUESTION: Well, there is no hearing, no nothing, I
gave you all the facts. The principal said, "You’ve bean late,
and you’ve been late too many times, and you deserve punishment?
I'm going to punish you, give ms the ruler", and whack!
MR, ROGOW:

I would say there would be an ~ there

should be an opportunity for a hearing under the Fourteenth
Amendment, because —

50

QUESTION?

I asked was that; a violation of tlx® Eighth

Amendment.
MR. ROGOW:

No, sir, it is not a violation of- the

Eighth Amendnent.
QUESTION? And the difference between that and this
case is?
MR. ROGOW:

Is the excessive and severe and brutal

nature of th® punishment, which is imposed.

I have said that

we ar© not seeking to outlaw under Eighth Amendment concepts
corporal punishment.
QUESTION: But you said punishment was the key.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes.

First one looks at punishment.

If the punishment is excessive or severe, the Eighth Amendment
may corns into play. That is our Eighth Amendment argument.
In the Fourteenth Amendment context, one looks at
punishment again *-**
QUESTION: Well, is the Fourteenth Amendment here?
MS. ROGOW: The due process argument.
QUESTION:

MR. ROGOW:

Is here?
Certainly.

If there is punishment that is to be imposed, what
we are saying is there must be an opportunity for a hearing
prior to the imposition of that punishment. Because there is
both a liberty interest which I talked about yesterday and a
property intereat, which I went to b© very clear on, is also

51

involved here*
James Ingraham was driven from that school by the
paddle for over a week*

Had he been suspended for over a week,

he would have been entitled to a hearing under Goss vs* Lopez,
He was in effect suspended by the paddle, so we have a property
interest that is involved, in addition to a liberty interest,,
One of the arguments that has been raised by Mr*
Howard
QUESTION:

But you don’t, have the property interest

involved in every case in which you contend procedural due
process is required*
MR. ROGOW:

No*

QUESTION: Because most cases would not involve the
school absence*
MR* ROGOV?:

No*

Another argument that has been raised here is that
■these are matters that should be left to the public schools*
We give wide latitude to the public schools in our argument.,
but fclvare com© moments when arbitrary decisions by governmental
officers bring the Constitution into play*
i

Here the due process hearings that we ask serve, as a
protection,

It provides rule by law and not nils by fiat,

protects the individual against arbitrary action by the
government*
These did not occur* These kinds of protections- did

52
not occur in this case. Thera was no consultation with -the
principal, and even if there were consultations with the
principal under Florida law# there is no opportunity to be
heard prior to the infliction of any corporal punishment.
And we are saying -there is severe deprivations that are involved#
and therefore there must be an opportunity to b© heard.
QUESTIONs Well# judging by your answer to Justice
Marshall’s question# a sever© deprivation wouldn't be necessary
if he's entitled to a hearing before he has one whack with a
ruler.
MR. ROGOW: I’m saying -chat in our — in a Fourteenth
Amendment context, that is a deprivation of liberty because it
involves ax. intrusion# a bodily intrusion, a deprivation of
privacy# the resultant# as the district court judge found# of
psychological harm# stigma# ridicule# all of that. And the
facts of this case support that.
QUESTION: What# one whack with a ruler is a deprivation
of privacy?
MR. ROGOWs

It certainly is an invasion upon one’s

privacy and freedom not to be — to have one's bodily integrity
invaded by the government.
QUESTION:
MR, ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Not to be whacked?
Not to be whacked.
Mr. Rogow# I think you agreed yesterday

•that there would be a tort action under Florida law against -the

53
principal and teacher involved.

Is there any reason to think

that 'that wouldn’t afford equally adequate relief to the
individuals in question here?
MR. ROGOW2

It. might afford equally adequate relief?

but Monroe vs. Pape says -that is not the test.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

If there is

I was asking whether

or not tha Florida courts? if recourse had been sought there,
would not have, afforded adequate relief?
MR. ROGOW:

It. would be available in the Florida

courts,
Children do not lose their rights at the
QUESTION r

Is the State law equivalent of the Federal

Tort Claims Act in Florida?
MR. ROGOW:

Not a State equivalent? the School Board

can be sued, the individual teachers could be sued.
QUESTION: There’s no immunity under Florida law?
MR. ROGOW;

No.

No.

But this case cannot turn on that issue.

If? for

instance? a prisoner were beaten and everyone concedes that that
prisoner has the right, to a hearing if he’s being punished by
100 whacks with a strap? 100 blows with a strap? he could sue
in State court or federal court; if there is excessive and
severe punishment that violates a constitutional right, both
courts are equally open.

Monroe vs. Pap®.

Children do not lose their rights at the schoolhouse

54

door.

That was the effect of the Court of Appeals decision..

It went much too far.
We submit that when children are in school, they are
in custody of school authorities, of people acting under color
of State law, and those persons are bound by the Constitution.
And for those reasons, the decision below should be
reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:36 a.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.]
