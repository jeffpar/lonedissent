ORMi ARGUMENT OF HERBERT F, MOORE, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR0 MOORE:

Mr« Chief Justice - and may it please the

Court 2
My name is Herbert F0 Moore, and we represent — the
appellants that we represent are two municipal corporations namely the City of Philadelphia and Glen Cove,

Long Island*

three rather large solid waste disposers located in the State
of New Jersey, and one very large solid waste collector, also
operating out of the State of New Jersey0
The purpose of our being here of course is to test
the constitutionality against the commerce clause of a statute
enacted in New Jersey, which is entitled, "An Act to prohibit
any person from bringing into this State any solid and liquid
waste which originated or was collected outside of the State»"
I feel compelled to explain, before I proceed into
tlx© legal arguments, some peculiarities of the present posture
of fee case, that lends it a certain uniqueness.
And that is that we started this out in the Superior
Court, Law Division, in New Jersey with a complaint that had,

4
I thinkf close to 20 counts # all of which were constitutional
questions.
But# in the interest of efficiency and on keeping
the court calendar reasonably unclogged# we proceeded through
the summary judgment procedure on an issue which did not
contain any disputed facts of material significance.
And it was on -that basis that Judge Schoch ruledg
in our favor# that the statute was unconstitutional# on the
grounds that it discriminated against interstate commerce? and
if, was on that basis that the appeal was taken by the State of
New Jersey to the appellate division.
QUESTION;

Under his view# what was the commerce?

The substance or th© service?
MR. MOORE;

I believe# Your Honor# it was both, th©

subject and the service.

He relied somewhat on the cases in

the Third Circuit# which was United States vs. Pennsylvania
Refuse Haulers Association# which was a case under the Sherman
Antitrust Act# in which th© Third Circuit held that the
transportation — the service and the disposal should be
looked at together as a unit# and they clearly were an item of
inters feat® comm© res.
And then# I believe# he also considered the substance:
itself as an item of commerce# because# as we know# there are
many# many items of solid waste ‘that are traded# sold arid used.
Recently this Court decided th© case of Hughes vs.

5
Alexandria» which dealt with automobile hulks.

And this Court

clearly accepted the fact that automobile hulks were i texas of
commerce., or legitimate items of commerce.
Does that answer your question, sir?
QUESTION: Well, I hear you.
MR. MOORE;

Okay.

Well, I think your qxiestion was, did the lower court
consider this -to be
QUESTION:

I wondered where you thought he rested

his weight.
MR. MOORE:

Well, he decided it on the basis — it

was my understanding — that the statute in New Jersey
discriminated against interstate commerce, and that was it.
And the other court, in the companion case, which
was decided by Justice Schrieber» and who is now on the New»
Jersey Supreme Court —- he decided that on the same basis,
that it was discrimination against interstate commerce, and
therefore must fall»
Now, that's a little different case, and of course we
That's a. totally different

were not involved in that case.
factual situation.

Now, I feel it's extremely important that we keep
in the foremost of our mind this statute of New Jersey»
#

Fortunately it’s a vary short statuta»

I don't intend to

read, it, but I wouid like fee point out some aspects of it.

6

The first section of the statute is a legislative
finding, in which the Legislature determines that there has
been a large volume of solid waste that has to be disposed of,
both in New Jersey and out-of-State, and that it presents a
threat to the environment, and appropriate landfill sites are
being rapidly diminished, and that the treatment on disposal
of wastes collected out of the State creates a public health,
safety and welfare nuisance, and also it is against it? and
it absolutely prohibits the treatment and disposal within
New Jersey of all waste generated out of the State®
So we have, in the finding close, an absolute
prohibition®
Now, when we get to the actual statute itself, or
the legislative determination, very interestingly, it starts
off with “No person shall bring into this State ... any solid
or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside of
the State55, except garbage to be fed to swine, which of course
is a solid waste, as we all know, until the Commissioner shall
determine that such action — and the action, obviously, has
to bes

go back to the “bring in".

is talking about®

That’s what the statute

*— can he permitted without endangering

the public health.
Now, we have approached this with the understanding
that this statute paints with a very, very broad brush.

This

statute is not directed against any particular type of disposal

7
~~ and, incidentally, disposal in New Jersey includes treatment
and processing and storage of solid or liquid wastes.

But

this statute deals with prohibiting the entry into the State
any item — which I will go into in a moment

legitimately

in commerce that is designated as solid or liquid waste.
Now, the first question, of course, when any statute
is tested against the commerce clause, is to determine whether
or not it is in fact commerce.

Because if it's not commerce,

you know, we'ra not in the ball gam© at all,,
Nov;, in this particular instance? solid and liquid
waste, as I mentioned just a moment ago in answer to the
Chief Justice's question, I pointed out that automobile hulks
are obviously solid waste.

Traditionally and historically,
4

all the byproducts of industry, many of them have commercial
viilue.

You have your scrap metals, your scrap glass, and

demolition material, and many, many other itarns, that are used
by various people, and various concerns where it is processed
and treated.

All of which are prohibited by this statute.

Now, in the case of United States vs. Pennsylvania
Refuse, which went to the Third Circuit and I believe certiorari
was denied, that case dealt specifically with actually what
we are dealing with here, with th© movement of solid waste
collected in Pennsylvania into New Jersey, to be disposed of
in New Jersey.
And the question came up, because th© refuse haulers

8
were being charged with criminal conspiracy — the question
came up- you know, "Well, you cannot

you do not have

jurisdiction under the Sherman Antitrust Act to prosecute us,
these collectors, because w© are engaged in dealing with a
worthless commodity, a worthless item,

and therefore it*s

not of any commercial value, ifc£s not commerce
And, of course, as we all realize, that the juris*»
diction of the Sherman Antitrust Act depends upon the commerce
clause -~
QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of New Jersey

distinguished that case, didn’t they, saying that their
congress had affirmatively exercised its power, whereas here
you are relying simply on the negative implications of the
constitutional provisions,
MR, MOORE;

Yes.

Yes, Justice Rehnquist, They

came up with that type of a reasoning, which we do not agree
with,

I don’t quite fully understand it, because the Sherman

-- if it’s not commerce for the purpose of enforcing anything
under the Sherman Antitrust Act, then it's not commerce for
any purpose,
Nov.?, if it is commerce under that Act, then at
least it is recognised as an itera in commeres.

How, I think

where tire confusion develops, perhaps, is that there is a general
body of lav; and understanding that when you are dealing with
the police powers of States, and they are dealing with public

9
health questions, the -- this Court and the Constitution has
gone to a great length to support police power actions in the
public domain, as long as certain tests and standards are met*
But to say that automobile hulks, for example, is
not commerce, is begging the question, and it just is not a
truism*
You have another aspect of this which is also very
interesting and vary important, in that the people who ar©
disposing in New Jersey at the present time, of solid and
liquid wastes, some or all of it coming from out of State, are
private enterprise*

They are public utilities, as legislated

by the State of New Jersey*

And being — and the collectors

i

and the disposers are public utilities*
They ar© dealing in a legitimate enterprise, and
they are depending, for the source of their material bo keep
them in a commercial business, on items that flow in inter­
state commerce»
QUESTION;
MR* MOORE 2
QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, —
Yes, sir?
— could Congress pass a statute

prohibiting the States from enacting this kind of legislation?
MR* MOORE;

You say did they or could they?

QUESTION; Could they?
MR. MOORE;

Oh, absolutely.

QUESTION; And would it be constitutional?

10

MRo MOOREj

I believe it absolutely would, sir»

QUEJ5TION;

You mean if -a State, by first processes of

inquiry, the usual legislative inquiry, determined that in a
given number of years all of their available space for the
disposal of solid wastes would be used up, and that the rate
— at the rate the State itself produced that waste, that
they could not say: We're going to save the Hew Jersey space
for Hew Jersey waste, and no other Stats may deposit waste
here? is 'that what you're telling us?
MR» MOORE:

In affect, I am, Your Honor»

Because

the H©i-j Jersey Supreme Court, in its handling of the case,
classified landfills as natural resources? and they did that
on three separate occasions in their opinion»
And when we look at the Oklahoma gas cases, and the
Pennsylvania-West Virginia gas cases, where the States, saying
that, "Look, we're going to run out of this natural resource
and our people aren't going to have, be able to have heat for
their homes, and the other purposes that natural gas is put to,
we're going to curtail the exportation of this natural
resource to protect ourselves", this Court very clearly upheld
that that was an imposition upon interstate commerce, in the
famous lines that have been often quoted:

That we sink or

swim together in this country, and the Northeast will keep its
timber and —* et cetera»
QUESTION:

You equate the export and the import as

II
being ‘the sane for purposes of the commerce clause?
MR* MOORE;

I think ifc is

,

because it's — what; is

happening her© -— yes, I think very definitely it is„

It is

just that — for ©sample, if RCA, which is a manufacturer in
New Jersey, if Hew Jersey, in order to increase its labor
market — increase employment, rather — said that RCA can only
us© transistors that are manufactured in New Jersey, and nobody
else can come in, then obviously it would be unconstitutional:
interference in interstate commerce.
And thatrs what is happening here.

But w© have to

keep going back to the statute. And this statuta goes way beyond
landfills.

This statute -QUESTION:

way:

Mr, Moore, let me come back at you this

Could Philadelphia and the City of New York make a

deal with your people that — to accept untreated sewage from
those cities?
MR, MOORE:

No,

The States unquestionably have the

right to regulate items that are inherently dangerous to them.
And New Jersey has adopted, in this instance, the DEP regula­
tions which are among the most strict in the United States,
just to avoid public health hazards,
QUESTION: And those regulations, you say, are valid?
MR, MOORE:

Very valid.

And in our Appendix we

quote from an affidavit of Mr. Darnay, who is one of the head
administrators of the DEP in Washing-ton, and he recognizes that;.

12
And# as a matter of fact# if I can call the Court5s
attention to the solid waste management plan# which the New
Jersey Supreme Court took judicial notice of in its opinion®
That solid waste management plan which was adopted
by the DEP in New Jersey says# on page 2# there is no
technological reason why we cannot dispose of solid waste with
minimal environmental harm®

On page 78# it said# The Bureau

of Solid Waste Management still has Chapter 8 of the Stata
Sanitary Code with which to regulate and assure nuisance-free
operation of disposal sites in conformance with good practice
and health standards®
QUESTION:

On® last question and I'll stop®

You wouldn’t read the New Jersey statute as# in effect#
being a State regulation of land use?
MR® MOORE:

No# sir.

The regulations have overtones of that# because the
regulations require a keeping of data as to the — how these
landfills have been used up®

But# in talking about landfills#

and to get back to the commercial —* whether it’s an item of
commerce:

Most any landfill that l*ve ever heard of or bean

connected with — and I’ve been representing these people for#
this industry# for a good 18 or 20 years ~ involves land -that
has no real market value®

It’s really marginal and submarginal

laird# and is being reclaimed by landfill operations®
And you can just look around# and I assume can take

13

judicial not3.ee of the Sport Complex in New Jerseywhich
they announced was built on a landfill*
QUESTIONS

Assuming you're right on the commere®

point? Mr. Moore? is there any economic benefit that is conferred
on any special group in New Jersey? as a result of what you
claim is a discrimination?
MR. MOORE;

Yes? very definitely? sir.

In our society today? solid waste? though not being
an exciting subject, of conversation? is a very essential on©.
And no industry can exist# or commercial enterprise can exist
without creating solid waste.

That has to foa disposed of some

way# either by burning it or burying it or putting -it in the
air? those are the only three places you can dispose of
any idling.
QUESTION;

Well? some of them carry it out to sea?

don't they?
MR. MOORE;

You're right.

I'm sorry7? I left one out.

Well? that’s the ocean.

You're absolutely right# Mr. Chief

Justice.
And it is a distinct economic advantage to industry
not to have to haul too far their waste to dispose it.
QUESTION: So you say? then# that it's New Jersey
industrial disposers who are the economic beneficiaries of the
New Jersey law?
MR. MOORE;

They are economic beneficiaries.

I am

14
not; saying they are the exclusive economic beneficiaries of
the New Jersey law, but they certainly are economic benefici­
aries .
As a matter of fact# a very high percentage of all
solid waste is not the waste that you and I think of when we
think of garbage# which we associate with it# because# you
know# we have homes and we see what is put out.

That's the

putrescibie type of waste*
But that’s the waste that they are feeding to swine*
There is a clear economic discrimination practically there# I
suppose*
Now# but —
QUESTION;

The discrimination is between New

Jersey disposers and disposers from other States?
MR* MOORE;
QUESTION;

Yes*
The former being able to use New Jersey

fills and the latter not being able to use them?
MR* MOORE;

That’s right*

And Philadelphia — and

when I say Philadelphia I am obviously not just confining it to
the municipal government# because all the commercial
activities in Philadelphia# industrial activities# many of them
use the Philadelphia collection system# although some of them
admittedly have their own trucks.
The question is# it’s very# very costly to move
refuse. And if you have/to move it more than twenty miles#

15

tli@ coste escalate very, very dramatically«
Nov?, as a matter of fact, the Now Jersey Suprema
Court made a comment, in trying to belittle that typ© of point,
saying that, Well, it would only cost Yonkers, I think it was
five dollars a ton, to go to the Croaton Landfill sit©# which
is in New York State some place»
But when you think of five dollars a ton# and multiply
that against tee tonnage we’re talking about, we’ra talking
about very large sums of moneya
QUESTION:

Well# frequently in some of these commerce

cases# like tee Madison Milk case# public health gloss is put
on the statute# and when you get behind it you see it’s actually
the local producers that got behind the Legislature or their
Common Council to enact it.
Is there any suggestion here that New Jersey
industrial disposers played kind of an active part in getting
tills thing enacted so they could benefit from it?
MR. MOORE;

No# unfortunately# they — I don’t

think they# to be honest with you# I don’t think they knew
anything about it.

I know how the statute originated# and it

didn't originate that way.

It was a political situation.

"New Jersey shall be a Garden State and not a Garbage
State" became a political cry of some politicians.
QUESTION; Well# if that were; literally true# you
still say that th© commerce clause controls?

16

MR* MOOREs

Absolutely, sir*

I think the controls

for these reasons — you mean that it is commerces, and an item
in commerce, and fits within that definition, so that w© can
apply the commerce clause»
I assume that — or have we gotten beyond that point?
I think we got beyond that point*
I think I have satisfied everyone that it is an item
in commerce*
QUESTIONs But that doesn’t —
MR* MOORE;

No, that doesn't finish the argument

at all, no*
QUESTION:
MR* MOOREs
QUESTION:

You don’t prevail by that —
No way, absolutely not*
— just on that alone*

I suppose you

would agree that a — certainly under the Twenty-first
Amendment — a State could exclude from its borders entirely
any or various kinds of alcoholic beverages, even though they
are, of course, items of commerce?
MR* MOOREs

Well, yes.

So I guess that one case,

what was it, Bowman vs. the railroad, where they stopped it.
But I think that was before that Amendment*
QUESTION:

Well, you may know better*

But, apart

from the Twenty-first Amendment, could the State exclude the
importation into its territory of slot machines, for example?
MR* MOORE:

Yes*

And they could — once you define

17
and make the datermination that the item is intrinsically
evil, which was never done her© — no place is it done by
the Legislature here
QUESTION;

Well, how free is a State — how free is

a State to declare by legislative fiat that an item is
intrinsically evil, or —
MRe MOORE;

Well, they have done it many times0

QUESTION;

Well, how free is a State to do it?

You would agree that it could do it with respect to slot
machines?

Could it do with respect to onions or potatoes?
MRo MOORE;

They can do it, but it can always be

contested, because it's got to be reasonable»

They can't

make an arbitrary determination that —
QUESTION:

It's got to apply to its own citizens

MR» MOORE:

Absolutely»

first»
And the -- sure, I mean, a

lot of States — that's why we've been having, you know, these
cases — over the years have made those kinds of determina­
tions to protect their milk and their shrimp and the peat case
that was recently decided by this Court, which Justice Brennan
wrote the opinion on»

I mean, that was a type of situation I

think the Supreme Court —QUESTION:

You say that a law excluding from

importation has to be linked with a law that prohibits the
existence in the State, as a product or in the possession of

18

Its own citizens of the sansa item? is that it?
MRo MOORE?

I don’t quite follow your question#

I’m sorry,, sir*
QUESTION:

Well# I think that was suggested by my

brother White’s question*

A State can lawfully exclude from

importation into the State slot machines# if# and only if# it
prohibits its own citizens from possessing or manufacturing
or operating slot machines*
MR* MOORE:

Is that it?

Well# you*re getting to dealing with the

matter even-handedly? I think#
QUESTION:
MR

MOORE:

QUESTION;

Well# isn't that part of —
Which is the Huron type of case.
Well# isn't that part of your case# that

this discriminates ~
MR# MOORE:

Well# my part of the case that this

very clearly discriminates# yes -QUESTION:
MR* MOORE:

Yes#
—* I haven't got to develop those

points yet# but that's what I was going to get into next# sir#
QUESTION:

All right*

MR. MOORE:

Right.

Next wa have to consider the tests that have been
developed# and I guess Pike vs. Bruce Church and Madison are
the cases where it's best synthesized and brought together#
and the test# very — I shouldn't say "very simply'5# because

19
it isn#t that»

But the teat says, of course, that when a

statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate
local purpose, and the effects upon interstate commerce are.
incidental, the statute will b© upheld.

Unless the burden

is excessive.
Then it goes on to state
cites Huron at that point in the

then it quotes Huron and
opinion, then it goes on to

say that if the legitimate local purpose found, then the —
if the legitimate local purpose is found, pardon me, then the
extent of the burden is going to be weighed and then, after
that, we®re going to look into a couple of items.

One is, Is

there a reasonable alternative available that would have a
lesser effect upon interstate commerce?
And then we come to the Madison doctrine, which,
frankly, I am not exactly too sure in my mind how it fits into
this, because that doctrine says "unless there is a nen­
dis criminatory alternative available".
I take the position that in this case that we are
dealing with, the Legislature of New Jersey clearly has not
treated in an even-handed fashion an item of commerce»

It

t

has said that this item of commerce is going to be discriminated
against, because of its source of origination, for example,
whether it be Pennsylvania, Hew York or Delaware»

In other

words, if people in Delaware want to ship in automobile hulks
into New Jersey, they cannot do it.

20

And that's a -point of discrimination# of an item
legitimately in commerce# as to its source.
And then they said to the people., the private
enterprise in New Jersey that are recognized public utilities#
they said to them# You can only get the materia! to use in
your business from New Jersey# you cannot import it from
out of State,
And that's in effect what they are saying.
And# as the affidavit® will show# two of these
appellants# virtually their entire business depends upon the
disposal of solid waste from Philadelphia, Which# incidentally#
*

is not putrescible waste.

The putrescible waste from

Philadelphia goes under the exception to the —

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the New Jersey landfill,

company at least has a place

solid waste, can use a New Jersey landfill.
MR. MOORE:

Well, that’s true.

But, as a matter —•

that’s true, but it can’t go into Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that.

QUESTION: But if you had — suppose you had a
Pennsylvania disposal company that wants to come over and
contract with a New Jersey industrialist to dispose of waste
in New Jersey?

The Pennsylvania company can do that, can it?

22

MR, MOORE2

Absolutely,

It's not directed at that.

It's directed at the entry of an item in cammare©.

And it

doesn’t make any difference whether itfs disposed in a landfill,
it cannot be put into an incinerator.

And the State has

admitted there’s no qualitative difference between refuse in
Pennsylvania and refuse in New Jersey; no qualitative
difference whatsoever.
Yet, does it make sens© to say that you cannot bring
waste from Pennsylvania into New Jersey and put it into an
incinerator?
QUESTION:

Is there any question in the record about

the nonavailability of this land?
I mean, for example, if the only placas that could
handle landfill would be serviced by New Jersey, couldn’t New
Jersey say, Well, that’s it; we can’t let anybody else in
because we don’t have holes enough.
s

MR. MOORE:
QUESTION:
MR. MOORE:

No, I don't —
That’s not in tills case at all, is it?
No, it isn’t.

See, unfortunately, this

case did not come up with a record because of the

it came

up in the summary fashion on those points. And so those
questions, which should, have been developed if, you know, if
the — it went back to a lower court, why, they would be
developed by proper testimony.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Moore, is there any question about the

23
finality of the judgment from which you are appealing?
Because the case does go back for trial- doesn't it?
MR* MOORE:

Yes

well, we were forced into this

situation, which I explained in our brief,,

The way it

happened, we argued -the matter on this summary judgment
position*

The Supreme Court of New Jersey, as you know from

the opinion, created a record for itself, by taking judicial
notice of certain things, and I immediately, when the opinion
came out — Iimmediately, when the opinion cam© out, went to
se© the Chief Justice of New Jersey, and Mr* Ski liman came
with m®, and pointed out that there ware many other matters
in this complaint that had been dealt with*
And, frankly, they were a little surprised, to be
honest with you, and so they gave us additional time to
develop memorandum on those points* And then, I think it was
about three weeks, and we both did, and then they cams out
with three different orders, which are in the Appendix* And
the orders said that you can go back without any restraints,
and we won’t retain jurisdiction, but you can go back to the
lower court to see if there’s any other appropriate relief
available*
Well, after the way the New Jersey Supreme Court
wrote this opinion, there’s no lower court judge that is going
to be able to do much*

And so an order was

entered dismissing

all the other counts under those circuit® tances, and this was

24
the final judgment»
QUESTION: Did you agree to that order?
MRo MOORE:

I think I'm running out of time, I'm

All the other counts have been dismissed,,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILLMANt ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR» SKILLMAN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The subject matter of this appeal is the disposal of
solid waste»
In New Jersey and elsewhere, government, in the
discharge of its responsibilities to provide for the health,
the welfare and the safety of its people, makes provision for
the disposal of waste, either by performing the service itself,
or by supervising and regulating private contractors who
perform the service»
The case thus involves that the performance of a
necessary public service — it is also clear, though, that
the State and its people pay a social cost for providing this
public service»

26
At the present time,, the only viable method of
solid waste disposal, with a few exceptions, is 'through land­
fills,,

This means that landfills ar

necessary*

However,

they are, at best, a necessary evil.
In New Jersey, virtually all landfills will produce
leachate, which is a highly noxious and polluted liquid that
pollutes both ground and surface waters.
Landfills also generate methane gas, such as is used
for cooking, and thus fires at landfills may occur even
decades after a landfill has been closed out.
Therefore, 'the disposal of waste is like crime.

If

we could wish away the problem or legislate away the problem,
we would.

But we can1 fc. We cannot simply say "no more

waste in New Jersey", we have to take care of the problem
somehow.
of waste.

So provision is made by the State for the disposal
It allows the use of its land for this purpose,

even though substantial and serious harm is caused to the land
and to the environment from this particular form of land use.
The question presented by this appeal is whether,
when a State such as New Jersey authorizes this use of its
land, it must also, under the commerce clause, make available
the use of its land to other States and their political
subdivisions for the same purpose.
I think it should be made clear at the outset, because
the point was perhaps somewhat blurred in the presentation of

27

the appellant,, that the New Jersey statute being considered
in this case* taken in tandemn with the implementing regula­
tions adopted pursuant thereto, prohibits the — solely the
entry into New Jersey of solid waste intended for disposal
in sanitary landfills»
I would direct the Court's particular attention to
page 96A of the Appendix, which is a regulation adopted by
tee State Commission of Environmental Protection to become
affective prior to the effective date of the statute, which
excludes from the purview of the prohibition upon entry into
New Jersey solid waste which is intended for any productive
us®»

It excludes garbage to be fed to swine»

It excludes

solid waste to be processed into secondary materials»

It

would exclude, for example, — there’s been a lot of talk
about tee automobile hulks, and the analogy between this case
and the Hughes case decided by the Court last term»
Well, tmder subsection <c) , if 70 — if there is —
if automobile hulks are reprocessed and, as were the facts in
the Hughes case, then, assuming that 70 percent of the material
in the car is reprocessed, which, as I understand is a matter
of industry practice, is the fact, then teat reprocessing would
fall within exception (c)e
So -*» it also should be noted teat the parties
involved in this case, th@ City of Philadelphia and the
sanitary landfill operators, who are feh© appellants. are engaged

28
solely in disposal in landfills.

So that any mention of

recycling or automobile hulks and so forth,

(a) is not within

this case, not within the facts of this case, not within the
method of business operation of the appellants; and (b) is
expressly excluded from the ban by the implementing regulation
adopted by the New

Jersey Commissioner of Environmental

Protection.
QUESTION:

In the Alexandria Scrap case, the hulks,

the very movement of the hulks was to take them off the
road and deliver them to a compressing plant which compressed
them and sold them for scrap steal, was it not?
MR. SKILLMAN:

That's my recollection of the facts,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: So that it was not something that was to
be disposed of by burying it or burning it or otherwise
getting rid of it.
MR. SKILLMAN:

That is correct.

And I think that that

is also the practice in New Jersey.
For example, I understand that there is a very large
automobile reprocessing plant in Jersey City, which is close by
to New York City, and that facility receives automobile hulks
not only from the State of New Jersey but also from New York
City, and that reprocessing operation does not fall within the
statutory ban which is the subject of this case.

This

statutory ban, taken in tandem: with the implementing regulation,

29

has to do solely with disposal in landfills * putting garbage
into the ground* with all of the attendant environmental
problems .
QUESTION:

It has to do with the importation of

wastes that are -— whose destiny is that»
MRo SKILLMAN:

Is that.

That is correct* Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But all Mew Jersey produced waste* these

disposers may use the landfills in New Jersey»

All New Jersey

produced waste.
MR. SKILLMAN:

All waste originating within the State*

yes* Your Honor? that is correct»
QUESTION:

To that extent* I gather the New Jersey

producers of the waste benefit by

this statute* do they not?

If they had difficulty because of the quantity being imported
in from Philadelphia in disposing of theirs* they now have
less difficulty since only their waste may be picked up by
New Jersey disposers ? is that right?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I ‘think that’s a theoretical

possibility* whether or not *—
QUESTION:

Are these filled up?

MR. SKILLMAN;

Well* as a practical matter* in the

northern part of the State* we are fast running out of landfill
capacity.

Until we reach the point of running out of landfill

capacity* I don't, think it makes too much difference in terms

30
of what: it; costs, for example, to put garbage into the ground,
whether there is additional garbage
or note

coining from New York City

The rates charged by a landfill are regulated by the

State Public Utilities Commission on a public utility base,
rate base, rats of return, and so forth*
Where the additional cost comes in is when w©
reach the point, in the not too distant future, where our land­
fill capacity, particularly in that part of the State, is
simply exhausted, and it means that municipalities and others
producing solid waste in the northern'part of the State ~~
QUESTION:

Ar© the rates disposers have to pay the

producers regulated?
MR* SKILLMAN:

The rates that are charged by the

landfills to the collectors are regulated by the State Public
Utility Commission, since 1970, Your Honor, on a rate base,*
rat© of return, same as any other public utility*
So that the only wayt that the additional cost would
come in is when we reach the point where all the landfill
capacity in the northern part of the State is exhausted, which
seems to be a real genuine likelihood at this point, and then,
if the people in 'the northern part of the State have to trans­
port their waste to the further extremes of the State, out
into western New Jersey, Sussex County, or southern New Jersey,
Burlington County, then that additional distance of trans­
portation, to that limited extent there would be, yes, an

31
additional cost at that point,,
QUESTION:

Unless it*s closer to take it over to

Pennsylvania*
MR» SKILLMAN:

Well, as a practical matter, we can’t

do that, because of the laws of Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

So Pennsylvania is keeping you out, too?

MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, Pennsylvania is keeping out

Philadelphia.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SKILLMAN;

Right.

Pennsylvania has very restrictive

legislation. They do not recognize landfills as being public
utilities.

And any municipality in Pennsylvania, which wants

to keep out waste originating in another municipality, can
do that. And apparently the great majority of municipalities
immediately surrounding Philadelphia have done just that.
And that is what has caused Philadelphia to coir®
over to New Jersey, which has, since 1970, legislation which
prohibits municipalities from having these kinds of restrictive
policies.

So, in a sens®, we’re the victim of our own

forward-looking legislation within the State.
QUESTION:

Do you rely at all on the federal statute

in answering the commerce argument?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, ~

Or on any federal statute as expressly

leaving the matter to the States?

32
HR. SKILLMAN:

Your Honor, it’s not: mentioned any-

where in the briefs, and it. just came to my attention on
Monday and was confirmed today, that the President signed,
only twelve days ago, a new statute dealing with solid wastes,
which, I think, for the first time, substantially — I don’t
know how substantially, but I think substantially federalizes
the subject matter of solid waste*
That statuta is entitled, "The Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976”, and it’s Public Law 94-580«
QUESTION:

Does it have any bearing on the question?

I mean, were it in effect when all this happened, would it
negate tiiis
MR* SKILLMAN:

I think we would still have this case,

Your Honor, and I think it only comas in very indirectly, in
the sense that there have been parenthetical references, at
least, in the briefs to federal statutes that remotely bear
on this subject matter, where —
QUESTION:

Does this, as my brother White suggested,

say anything about what States may do with these waste's?
MR. SKILL-MAN:

Let me just briefly summarize what

I think th© statute does -- and I must say that I am at a
disadvantage, of having only come across this, having the
statute brought to my attention the first time on Monday,
and having read through it once.
What it does is confer substantial power on the

33
federal environmental protection, administrator, to set guide­
lines for the States in formulation of regional plans for
solid waste recovery and/or disposal? and it imposes an
obligation on the States to formulate regional plans» And
those .plans may, after appropriate consultation and coopera­
tion and so forth between the Governors involved, have
interstate components to them»
Now, the teeth in -the legislation — 1 shouldn't say
that it compels the States to do anything, because -there are
no — this is a carrot rather than a stick type piece of
legislation.

The carrot is that if the States want federal

money for purposes of resource recovery, capital projects, and
other solid waste activities?, they must have plans which
conform with the federal guidelines.
But I think that the —•
QUESTION: Well, what's the negative —- say, a State
says, ”AwfulXy sorry? we don't want any of your money”, what's
the negative implication from the federal statute, that it9s
up to the State?
MR. SKILLMAN:
that.

On the first reading, I don't see

I think it's —* there is strict — on a first reading,

I don*t s@© the stick in the legislation.

I think it’s

strictly voluntary —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but that isn't what —

is the negative implication, if the Stata doesn't want federal

34
money, that Congress intends to leave the matter entirely up
to the State?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Yes, I think the answer is yes. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, then, why doesn’t that have some •

relevant® here, if that’s so?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

I think it does have some relevancy.

It will have new relevance on the

interstate commerce, I imagine, wouldn't it?
MR. SKILLMANs

It certainly has relevancy in the

sense that we hav® sought, throughout this litigation# to
draw a very sharp distinction between what the commerce clause,
standing alone and without congressional legislation, auto­
matically prohibits, and what Congress can do under the
commerce clause if it perceives a social problem, which has
some — which impacts in soma fashion upon the interstate
commerce,
QUESTION:

And your brother answered a question by

my brother Blackmun during the course of his argument, to the
effect that he thought that Congress could legitimately, under
its commerce power, enact legislation that would prohibit,
affirmatively prohibit the States from doing what the State of
New Jersey has done in this ease.
But., conversely, it’s suggested, I think, that in its
recent legislation Congress has, under its commarce power,

35

enacted legislation which would seem to permit the States to
do what New Jersey has done* And certainly Congress could
explicitly enact that kind of legislation- couldn't it?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I have little doubt but that Congress

could enact such legislation*
QUESTION: Do you have any doubt?
MR* SKILLriAN:

I don't have any doubt, no*

I also am very reluctant to make too many representa­
tions as to what this new legislation provides, having just
had the benefit of having read through it once.
QUESTION:

It was enacted —• or signed by the

President twelve days ago, or somathing?
MR* SKILLMAN:

October 21st was the date it was

signed by the President.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

Do you take issue, since I've

already interrupted you, with the appellants0 basic question,
basic proposition, that liquid and solid waste is an article
of commerce?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I take very sharp issue with that,

Your Honor. And I think that the problem is that ~ the old
problem of one word having many meanings, depending upon what
the context is.
I have no doubt teat solid waste, or the service of
providing for disposal of solid waste is interstate commerce,
in the sens® teat

36
QUESTION;

Of course,, if it moves interstate* then

it's interstat® commarce*
MR. SKI ELMAN;

— the court took note of the

congressional action in antitrust laws in the Pennsylvania Ref vise
case that they have cited»
However* that does not mean that it is commerce in
the sense that it falls within the zone of free trad© protected
by the commerce clause* even in the absence of congressional
action.
QUESTION; hr© you familiar with the case that cam®
from Los Angeles* the Meat Drivers case, involving commerce
in grease that was discarded by restaurants in Los Angeles*
that was a government antitrust case* brought to break up an
alleged conspiracy in restraint of trade in grease discarded
by restaurants?
MR* SKILLMAN:

I am not familiar with that case,

Your Honor»
It sounds like it may be similar to the Pennsylvania
Refuse case* that has been railed upon by the appellants»

item was an item in commarce»

It was then sent overseas* as

After having been reprocessed.

MR. SKILLMAN;

In drawing the distinctiori between

what commerce means in the context of authorizing congressional
action and what it means in the context of what it prohibits

the States from doing# even absent congressional action# the
Court has developed a doctrine on what -they call illegitimate
items of commerce.

These are items such as diseased animals#

other items that are ~~
QUESTION:

Contraband# I suppose# would fall in that

category, wouldn’t it?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I would think that it would.

QUESTION: Well now# how free is a State to define
contraband?

Can it define potatoes as contraband?

MR. SKILLMAN:

Absolutely not.

I think that there

such a characterisation by a State Legislature has the right
to do so,,

And there may be certain —
QUESTION: What would the criteria be to measure the

State’s power?

MR. SKILLMAN:

Well# we start off# I think, with a

presumption that the legislative characterisation is an
accurate on©.
QUESTION:

Right.

That’s the basic presumption of

constitutionality, I suppose.
MR. SKILLMAN:

That’s the basic presumption. And

then it’s a matter of the attacking party developing a record
to show that the factual premises of the legislation are not
valid premises.

QUESTION:

When you were discussing Administrative

Order No. 40# that you cited us to on Appendix 96# I took it
that you were telling the Court that all legitimate commerce

39

is protected by the exceptions that are listed here„

Is that

substantially what you were saying?
MR,, SKILL MAN:
QUESTION:

Well, —

MR, SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely,

And if there are any other —*

— if it has any value like the hulk of

an automobile, lik© garbage that can be fed or used for
fertilizer or whatever, then it*s not covered; there5s no
prohibition of that kind of interstate commerce,
MR, SKILLMAN:

That5s correct.

And if anyone were in a position to show us that
those four exceptions listed in the regulation are not
exhaustive of the types of things one can do with waste that
are legitimate and productive, w® could certainly at that
point adopt further exceptions to the ban.
The object of the statute is disposal in landfills,
and only that.

Now, I mean I can conceive that if other

showings could be mads — for example, some recycling process
was helping us get rid of waste, and was producing an article
of commerce, but at the same time was blowing off tremendous
amounts of air pollution, we might have an argument there also.
But that's just not the present State regulation before the
Court,
QUESTION;

You say that landfill has no value?

in this case Philadelphia —

who wants to dispose of its refuse, just pays the landowner
for the privilege of dumping its refusa on the landowner's

MRo SKILLMAN:

That's correct.

So that there*s no question but that there is a
financial transaction there? but I think it's clear under the
Clason case, and the quarantine, the diseased animal
quarantine cases, that the mere fact that you find somebody
selling somebody a service in connection with the disposal of
waste or something doesn't mean that you have, quote unquote,

There apparently is ona city in

are not even sure of the present, but the city apparently at
times in the past has used a disposal site in the State of
Pennsylvania.

But essentially New Jersey takes car© of its

QUESTION:

If w© should agree with the trial court

MR® SKILLMAN:

For the most part# no®

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT F. MOORE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MOORE;

Yes, in just a moment.

I think New Jersey is being shortsighted, as the
question raised, in this type of legislation, because it is

50

possible that north Jersey is running out of landfill space.
Upper New York State is far closer to Hew Jersey for disposal
of solid waste,

North Jersey, that is, than South Jersey,

The big problem in cost involved, it would absolutely
be economically unthinkable to haul waste from Bergen County
down to Burlington County with fch© congestion in New Jersey,
Whereas it would b© much cheaper to go into New York State —*
and there’s no problem going into New York State. There’s no
New York statute that says we can't go in,
QUESTIONi Well, you ar© now talking about the
economic and really political realities and social —■>
MR, MOORE5

Well, the question was raised here, and

I just wanted to clarify that, that it is a great advantage.
And this typ© of statute does seriously interfere with the
commercial future for New Jersey,
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen,

Th© case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 2s5! o’clock, p,m,, the case in th©
above-entitled matter was submitted,]
