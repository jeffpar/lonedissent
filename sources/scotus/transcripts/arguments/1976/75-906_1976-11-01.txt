MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

s

lie will hear arguments

first this morning in 75-906r Walsh against Schlechfc.
Mr, Weil, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL R. NEIL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves interpretation and application
of Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of
1947, as amended, popularly known as the Taft-TIartley Act,
in fchle context of payments to trust required by the terms
cf a subcontractor’s clause in a collective bargaining
agreement.
This Court is asked to review a decision of the
Supreme Court of Oregon rejecting petitioner's defense that
the subcontractor's clause conflicts with the requirements
of Section 303 (c)

(5).

The question on which petitioner sought certiori —■
which was briefed and decided, among other questions, by
the Supreme Court of Oregon — is whether the subcontractor’s
clause, in requiring a signatory employer to make trust
contributions on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
employees of a non-signatory subcontractor violates the 302(c)
(5) requirement that trust agreements must benefit only

4
employees of contributing employers.
It is apprently conceded by respondents in this
court — I read their brief so to concede implicitly —
that the subcontractor’s clause thus construed, that is, to
benefit — to require contributions for the benefit of or
on the behalf of the subcontractor's employees, would violate
Section 302(c)

(5).

Instead, respondent's brief as I read

it raises three arguments which were not made below and
which now, apparently, are the questions to be decided by
this Court,

I accept this.

These are valid — they're not

I don't agree they're valid arguments.

—

But I think they are

validly raised by the respondent.
These questions are, one, they now seek to have
an interpretation of Article IV of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement, the subcontractor's clause, different from that
made by the court below as I read the opinion of the court
below..

They say that the clause should be read to merely

measure contributions to the trust by the hour3 of work
of the non-signatory subcontractors'* employees, and not to
require contributions for their benefit or on their behalf.
That is the first argument they make.
The second is, that two of the trusts (the
Apprenticeship Trust and the Vacation Trust) are 302(c)(6)
trusts in purpose, and therefore not subject to the requirements
of 302(c)(5) concerning beneficiaries.

5

Third, they say that one of the trusts, the CIAF
for Construction Industry Advancement Fund Trust, is not a
302 trust at all.
Petitioner, we submit, is entitled to prevail on
all of these issues as well as on the original issue.

The

facts giving rise to this controversy are these.
QUESTION:

Mr. Neil, before you go into it: if

they're right on the first argument, that’s the end of the
whole case, isn’t it?
MR. NEIL:

I believe that’s right, your honor.

QUESTION:

Is that a federal question at all, the

construction of Article IV, or is that a matter for the
Supreme Court of Oregon?
MR. NEIL:

No, as I — well, it would be to my

advantage to argue it's a matter for the Supreme Court of
Oregon.
question..

But I don’t think it is.

I think it’s a federal

I think since Lincoln y. Mills of Alabama that

the construction of collective bargaining agreements in
interstate commerce has been a matter of federal law.

This

Court might well respect the interpretation of the Supreme
Court of Oregon, but I do not think it binding on this Court.
The petitioner, Mr. Walsh, is a builder of multiple
family housing in Portland.

He formed a limited partnership

of which he became the general partner to build and operate
a 56 unit apartment project in Salem, Oregon known as Oak Hill.

6

And this project was HUD supported, federally financed, and.
therefore, by agreements required by HUD, the contractor
and his subcontractors was required to adhere to the
provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, principally the requirement
of paying prevailing wages, including fringe benefits#either
to workmen on the job or into trust.
The limited partnership subcontracted the carpentry
framing work to a non-union subcontractor, Lloyd Jackson,
Walsh, of course# was bound by the terms of the collective
bargaining agreement with the Carpenter’s Union that had
this subcontractor's clause in it, in addition to requiring
Walsh to pay, if he hired his own carpenters, a total of
96£ per hour into these five trusts.
The subcontractor's clause is cruoted at pages 5-6
of our brief and elsewhere in the brief, and it says in
general that VJalsh# as a signatory to the agreement, shall
either hire and retain only union subcontractors or, .if.
he fails to do so ~~ and these are the crucial words — he
shall quote be liable for these employees' wages, travel —
and then it goes on to list contributions to the five trusts.
Now during the construction, the Carpenter's Union
found out, of course, that there was a non-union sub on the
job and protested to Mr. Walsh who said that he was bound,
by the terms of the subcontract, that he could not discharge
the non-union subcontractor.

7
But Mr. Walsh, the record shows, did cooperate
in arranging for the non-union sub to meet with the union
people and to negotiate as to whether they could be organised,:
That was unsuccessful.

But it is agreed in the record that

Mr. Walsh was cooperative in that respect.
QUESTION:

How does that affect the central issue

MR. NEIL:

Wall, I'm trying to make the point,

here?
i

your honor, I guess, that my client is net hostile to unions.
He insists on his rights under this clause.

But I don't

think that — I think this evidence is that he is not
unfriendly toward unions.
During the — it is stipulated that the subcontractor
paid his men directly.

Jackson, the non-union subcontractor,

paid his. man directly the 96£ per hour amount in fringe
benefits, that is, an amount equal to the trust contributions
that would have been required if a union subcontractor had
been employed.
The Oak Hill Project was
QUESTION:

Was that part of their original employment?

MR. NEIL;

Excuse me, your honor?

QUESTION:

Was that under their original employment.,

or did that come about after the union raised this contribution
question?
MR. NEIL:

No.

i see your question.

That is a

8

good question.

No, this was paid from the outset.

The

subcontractor was made aware at the beginning that this
was a Davis-Bacon Act job.

There are forms in evidence for

his payroll, and right on the form it says: are you paying
your fringes directly to your men, or are you paying them
to a trust?

He checked, directly to his man.

And it is

stipulated that he did so.
The Oak Hill project was completed in November of
1971.

And a year later, these suits ware brought seeking

payment to the trust by Walsh of the same amount that the
subcontractor had previously paid into the trust.

Ro we

say, in effect, a doutle payment or a second payment of
the seme benefits already paid to Walsh's men — excuse
me, to Jackson's men — is being required from the
principal contractor, Walsh.
QUESTION:

I may have misunderstood what you say.

You said, double payment to the trust?
MR. NEIL:

No.

We say a double payment is being

required, in affect, by the contractor.
QUESTION;

I see.

The first payment was to the

employees rather than —
MR. NEIL:

Yes.

The contractor had to pay a fixed

price to the sub, Jackson, for the work, obviously from
which Jackson paid his men the 96$ among other things.
QUESTION;
t

I see.

9
MR. NEIL:

So when we say that when Walsh is required

to pay this now to the trust that he has already paid the
fixed price, including the fringes, once.

Now he has to

pay them a second time.
QUESTION:

You say that is a violation of the

MR. NEIL:

No, I don’t contend that in itself is

statute?

a violation of the statute.
QUESTION:

What do you contend?

MR. NEIL:

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

What is the question?

MR. NEIL:

It violates --- the question is, if we

construe Article IV of the subcontractor’s clause correctly
to require contributions by Walsh for the benefit of, or
on behalf of, the subcontractor’s employees, we say this
violates Section 302(c)(5), the requirement that benefits
be paid out of those trusts under 302 only for the benefit
of employees of the contributing employer or of other
contributing employers.
QUESTION:

Jackson is not one.

Well, but there are no benefits being

paid out to the sub's employees.
MR. NEIL:

That's true, but 302 deals not only t«?ith -

QUESTION:

Then they aren't beneficiaries of the

QUESTION:

Well, are they or not?

MR. NEIL:

No, I don't think they are.

They're

not legal beneficiaries,
QUESTION:

Wall, then, how is the statute violated?

MR, NEIL:

The statute is violated because 302

prohibits either paying or an agreement to pay.
QUESTION:

Wall is there an agreement to pay?

MR. NEIL:

Article IV, we say, is an agreement

requiring Walsh to make contributions to the trusts for
the benefit of — and we say it would follow that it is an
agreement that these men should be paid these benefits.
The strongest case, your honor, is the vacation

that the

The. employer pays into the trust the money for the vacation
pay, and that sum i3 paid to the workmen for whose benefit
it is paid plus any earnings, their pro rata share Gf any
earnings on the sum paid into the trust.
Now —

Well, but, did the employees of the sub

MR. NEIL:

There is no evidence that they did, your

honor.

that they will be?

11
MR. NEIL:

I contend that under Article IV that

that is the intention.

I would concede that the trust

agreements themselves, which, as you will see, are much
more carefully drawn documents than the collective bargaining
agreement, are intended probably to restrict the beneficiaries
to contributing employers, with one exception: it says
in Article VIII of the principal agreements that, although
the rights of the beneficiaries and everyone else to these
trusts are defined — are as defined in the trust agreements,
their terms are subject to the collective bargaining
agreement.

So it leaves open, it seems to me, individual

collective bargaining agreements to vary the terms of the
trust.

And we contend that’s exactly what happened by

Article IV of the subcontractor's clause.
Wo think, in affect, that the union got carried
away probably in Article IV in penalising — and I don’t —
I agree that penalising the employer in and of itself is
not unlawful.

But we think the union probably got carried

away in drafting Article IV in a penalty way that they we re
not cognisant of the requirements of Section 302(c)(5).
We say that our interpretation of Article IV, that
is —
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume the --- let’s assume

that Article IV was perfectly clear, that the — that the
employer would be required to pay into the trust an amount

12

of money measured by the — not only his own employees but
the sub's employees, even if the sub was not organized and
unionized.

And let’s assume that it expressly said that

this is an order to encourage contractors to employ union
subcontractors.

And so it's perfectly clear the intention

was to make him pay twice if he used a non-union —- would
that violate the statute?
MR. NEIL:

No, it would not, your honor, though

you're positing an agreement of the type of Kreindler,
of Budget Dress, of Greenstoin,all of -which are cited by
the other side _

&nd ft involved contracts ir the garment

industry which said exactly that.
QUESTION:

!

Well, the question is, of course, I

suppose, whether that kind of a payment is an authorized
payment by an employer on behalf of the union.
MR. NEIL:

Yes, I think it is.

The —-

QUESTION:

And you think the statute would authorize

that kind of a double payment?
MR. NEIL:

Well, 1 don't know as it authorizes it,

but I don't think it prohibits it.
QUESTION:
one.

Well, you know, it isn't a forbidden

You say it isn't the kind that's — it isn’t a

MR. NEIL:

So these three cases held, and I haven’t
Because the requirement that we are

13
proceeding on says that you may not require payments to a
trust for the benefit of people other than employees of
contributing employers.
QUESTIONj

Then it is clear, from what you said

before, that yon think these employees can never get any
benefits.
MR. NEIL:

No.

Yes, they -- it's not true they

can never get any benefits.
to become

If they in the future were

wall, I won't say the future.

If they in

the past had worked for a contributing employer, a signatory
employer, they could have qualified as an employee of a
contributing employer by past employment for a signatory
employer.

Therefore, contributions made by Walsh here for

those employees, even though their present employment is by
a non-signatory employer, might not be unlawful under
302(c)(5).

And that point is harped on in the brief by

re spondent.
However, there is no evidence in this record that
the employees ever did work for any signatory employer prior
to this.

Respondents say, well, people in the construction

industry move around from employer to employer, from job
to job.

That's quite true.

But it is rare, I submit, that

people in the construction industry move from union employers
to non-union employers and vice versa.

You're either one

or the other, you're -- in this industry.

Or you're a workman for a non­

And I submit it to ba very.unlikelyf even

though the record does not speak to this, that these workmen
of Jackson's would ever have been employees of a union
employer prior to this time.

It's conceivable but unlikely,

I say.
QUESTION:

On the theory of the Section IV of the

contract, that this was for the benefit of the employees,
you think the employees could maintain an action in equity
to impress that money with a constructive trust?
MR. NEIL;

Possibly.

It’s clear that they could

not maintain an action against the trust for trust benefits.
That’s what Moglia out of the 2nd Circuit holds; then an
illegal payment to the trust does not create a right of
the beneficiary or intended beneficiary to sue the trust
for benefits.

So probably, to answer your question, Mr.

Chief Justice, no, because these employees in this case
already received payment of these benefits.

So if they

were to do that they would, in effect, be seeking a double
payment.

The correct procedure, I would think, is that

we’re following, which is to set up a defense to the
contributions when sued for, or, possibly, we could sue to
get them back if we held paid them.
QUESTION:

Well under —* that suit would be under

Oregon law presumably, the hypothetical casa I suggested.

15
But if the Supreme Cour't of Oregon had no difficulty assessing,,
in effect — determining that double payments were appropriate,,
is there anything in the law of the equity doctrine of
Oregon that would preclude having the employees get double
benefit?
MR. NEIL:

Apparently not, because Oregon ruled on

a matter of equitable law in this case and rejected our
arguments along those lines.
The rationale of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion
is that it does not accept the Meglia case, at least as I
read it.

It is saying that even though you accept our

construction of Article IV, that is, that the contributions
are required for the benefit of Jackson's employees, that
doss not violate 302 (a)(5).
QUESTION:

Moglia is very distinguishable on its

QUESTION:

I must confess, I don't understand the

relevance of Moglia at all.

Because that case, as I remember

17

It, just dealt with whether or not the employees can receive
benefits.

It didn't have anything to do with contributions,

did it?
MR. NEIL :

Well, the rationale of the Court in

Moglia says that — lays down a principle which we quote in
our brief that — one of tbs reasons they say why the person
seeking a pension there, as I recall it, cannot obtain one is
because his or her employer never paid into the trust at all,
or excuse me, they did pay into the trust, but under — without
a written agreement.

Therefore the contributions into the

one side.

And the Court goes on to make statements to the

effect that only employees of employers who are lawfully
contributing to the trust may receive benefits.

So it seems

to me the rationale relied on by Moglia is applicable,
QUESTION:

Well, that means the employees of the

subcontractor in this case could not legally obtain benefits
from this trust.

That's what that means.

MS. NEIL:

I agree.

illegal contributions as well as illegal contributions.

It

does not just prohibit trusts that violate the statute»

It

also prohibits any kind of agreement to make an illegal
payment, or to make — require an illegal contribution.
QUESTION:

But the legality of the payment turns

on for whose benefit it is, and by a matter of law under
Moglia it can't he for the benefit of the employees of the
sub, as I read it.
MR, NEIL:

But the testimony indicates, your honor,

I submit, that that isn't what the parties thought? that
the people who enforced this agreement on a day to day
basis thought that these subcontractor's employees could
benefit.

And they thought that they were announcing a

principle that non-union people aren't disqualified by
that mere fact from being beneficiaries.

And that is true.

But I don't think that conclusion follows at all.

Because

it seems to me there was every attempt in the lower court,
in the evidence, to make these people beneficiaries.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us whether the

general ever had any employees for whom it made contributions?

It does not.

MR. BAILEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We’re here representing these trust funds, and —

Because these are jointly administered trust funds, four of
them are.

And in that respect I refer to the Health and

Welfare, Pension, Apprenticeship, Vacation.

The fifth

employer-administered fund, employer trusteed, and therefore
should not be used in connection with 302 at all.
a Taft-Hartley fund.

It's not

So reference to that should not be a

reference to the other funds which are jointly administered.
These trustees are authorized and directed both
by the trust agreement and now by federal law to enforce
the trust agreements and to force collections of contributions
that are provided for in those trust agreements.

And that’s

what this action was initiated for.
We are really not in a great deal of difference or
contravention of what counsel for petitioner has stated here.

20
particularly in view of the law.

Because we do agree that

if these trust agreements do permit contributions to be
received for the benefit of a non-signatory employer’s
employees, that that would violate the 302 provisions of
(c) (5) .
QUESTION:

And that’s set up in the working

In the trust agreements themselves they were

very careful in the drafting of it to provide that they

they should do.
Section 2, Article II of — I'm first speaking of
the Health and Welfare which is in plaintiff's exhibit #4
and recited in our brief — that section provides that the
purpose of the Health and Welfare contributions and the
funds established there shall be for the benefit of employees
of the individual employer.

And it goes on and says other

things.
The definition of employee is spelled out in Article '
of the agreement.

Article I of each of these agreements

provide that the employee, whether union or non-union, is a —
defined of any employee, whether union or non-union, of an
individual employer.

That’s set

out in Article I, Section 5 of the trust agreement.

There

employer as an employer who is required by tha collective

contributing employer.

never — or right now, anyway, cannot benefit the employees
by whose hours they are measured.
MR. BAILEY;

Yes, I think that's correct.

I think

we're also, in certain instances, these trust funds sue
employers for monies that are in excess, as an example, the
benefit schedule that's established.
QUESTION:

So they’re really not for the benefit —

they're really not necessary to maintain the integrity of
the trust?
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTIGN:

The actuarial determination of the trust
Because they just aren't — because there's

some people whose hours measure these contributions just
can never benefit.
MR. BAILEY;
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY;

Well, we have pointed out. —
Well, isn't that true or not?
•WeIX, I don't say that it is true on

the basis that —
QUESTION;
MR. BAILEY:

Wall, do you deny it’s true?
Well, I say, Mr. Justice, that the

basis of the actuarial determination of these funds is

24

premised on the dollars paid in that go specifically to
benefits.

They also are actuarial determinations on the

amount of overfall ■— that9 a money that comes in over the
amount that's necessary to pay for contributions.
of these people never benefit at all.
QUESTION:

And some

Because they don’t —

Well# what you’re saying# then, is that

you have to sue to collect on behalf on money — or wages —
paid to soma employees who can themselves never benefit in
order to make the fund actuarially sound for those employees
who can benefit.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

The —

Just a small point, Mr. Bailey.

Strictly

speaking, the trustees brought suit as third party beneficiaries
of the labor contract, is that correct?
MR. BAILEY:

That’s correct.

And that’s their

obligation on both the trust funds, they said, and also ERISA.
We are submitting that — and argue that the defense
raised by petitioner herein was the defense that he raised
initially below? but also he’s arguing that the language of
Article IV of the trust agreement has to be determined to be
on the behalf of or for the benefits of these people. We
€
think that strains it. We think that certainly attempts to
modify the trust agreement which in itself provides that
the monies coming into the trust shall be used only for
the benefit of individual employers -— employees who are

25
signed up.
Vfe ask —- and he has used the phraseology in his
briefing -- petitioner has — we ask that if a person was
going to look for benefits under these funds, hs must really
look to the trust agreement, and not to the working agreement.
Because the working agreement only spells out what monies
will go into the trust.
We submit that the trust agreement, in and of itself,
is an agreement that is legal, complies with the statutes,
that there is no record — no evidence and no proof shown
by petitioner whose obligation it is to make that showing
here — that any employee has received benefits in violation
of the law or the trust agreement.
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTIONs

Mr. Bailey —
Yes.
— do you think the construction of

the trust agreement lea a matter of state law or federal law?
MR. BAILEY:

Well, I would assume that because it

is a document drafted in state law, it would be a matter of
construction of state law unless there is a federal question
that, could properly operate on.

Here we think the construction

and that's where wa think we're down to; we're not disagreeing
with petitioner on the law of the case, and that's the 302
lav;, but we do say that the construction of that particular
paragraph, or that particular contract, is a matter of state

/

26

law.
QUESTION:

tod the Oregon Supreme Court has construed

it.
MR. BAILEY:

Yes.

Yes, that's what we say.

A a oilmen t I would make •—- an additional comment, if
I may ■—
QUESTION:

You wouldn't question that if the contract

violated section 302 that it would fall, would you?
MR. BAILEY:

X would have to agree with that, that

if that’s the connotation given to it.
a

We submit that it's

strained effort that the petitioner is making hers to

say that Article IV does provide for benefits, we think —
QUESTION:

Aren't there decisions in this court

that say that the construction of a collective bargaining
agreement in this kind of a law suit is a matter of federal
law?

Lucas Flower and Dowd Box and some of those?
MR. BAILEY:

some aspect of it.

Well, it could well be that there is
Here we're talking about the construction

of this statute.
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

No, we're talking about the construction -I'm sorry.
— of the collective bargaining agreement.

That was the question as I understood it.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, more specifically, we're talking

27

about the construction of a trust agreement.
QUESTION:

So you5re suing on a promise that’s in

a collective bargaining agreement —
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— not a trust fund.

MR. BAILEY:

That’s correct.

But the defense that’s

been raisedto our suit on a promise is the defense that
these are contributions that would benefit people who are —■
QUESTION:

The question is, whether in the light

of 302 p this promise in the collective bargaining agreement
is enforceable.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Well —
Which in turn turns on whether they’re

beneficiaries within the meaning of the trust agreement.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTIONs

That's correct.
So ultimately the construction question

is one of the trust

instrument rather than the collective

bargaining agreement.
MR, BAILEY:

That's what we’ve maintained all the

way, that you have to go to the trust agreement to find out
«•

what —*
QUESTION:

-v~

the petitioner’s claim is that they

intended, they agreed, to make contributions on behalf- of
employees of an employer who was not making a contribution.
MR. BAILEY:

All right.

May I address myself to —

28
QUESTION:

Well, that33 his claim, isn’t it?

MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s his claim.
So it’s a quasiion about construing

that collective bargaining agreement.
MR. BAILEY:

I understand that, yes.

But to reach

that, and to make that contention, petitioner has to — and
I would think, wrongfully —- has to act or use the language
of 302 (c)(6) as encompassing 302 (c)(5) of the Act.

The Act

itself spells out that under 302(c)(5) it must be for the
exclusive benefit of contributing employers’ employees.

When

the Congress enacted amendment by 302.(c) (6) , it added such
things as vacation-;’ apprenticeship and things of that
nature which are involved here, and did spell out in 302(c) (6)
that the provisions of 302(c)(5) (B) would likewise be the
ones that would apply.

And that’s the provisions that sets

up the trust agreement program.

It did not specifically

set up the requirement that it be for the exclusive benefit
of employees.
.Additionally, when counsel in his — or petitionerhas referred to that all five funds should be treated the
same, and using the language of Article IV to say so, he
\

is saying there that the construction industry advancement
fund is also one that goes to the benefit of employees.

We

say that that’s a strange interpretation of Aurticla IV to get
to that point, basically because there, are no specific

29

benefits to employees of — at all under the Apprenticeship
and Training, nor are there any benefits that go to anybody
in the Construction Industry Advancement Fund.

Both of

those could not be for the benefit of any of these employees.
Thus, he has to strain the language in order to
reach the results that hass urging that the language in
Article XV does say what he says it is, and that is, that it's
for the benefit of employees.
QUESTION:

If there were no Article XV in that

collective bargaining contract, there wouldn't be any case
here, would there?
HR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well, then the genesis of everything in

this case springs from a collective bargaining agreement.
MR. BAILEY:

That's right.

We're suing on that.

But his — and we’re saying that in effect his defense has
to rest .on the fact that the benefit payments for employees
would benefit employees of a non“contributor.

And we both

agree that that is unlawful at least as far as the 302(c)(5)
says.
QUESTION:
X

Wall, neither the general contractor nor

the subcontractor were in perfidy with the trust agreement
in any way, were they?
MR. BAILEY?

They were this way, because in the

agreement that the general contractor Walsh, your petitioner,

30

executed he agreed to adopt the terns of the trust agreement.
That's a part of his agreement.

So he did adopt that.

Now,

the subcontractor was not signatory at all, so he did not»
Wa say that basically this whole case has dropped
down to one — or, what do the words, for these employees
contributions, mean?

That’s the language of the Article IV.

And we think that it does not -- we submit it, that it doss
not mean what the petitioner has indicated here, or urged
on this Court, or on the court below.

Because we do spall

out here that it could not mean that, particularly when you
get down to Apprenticeship and fcha CIAF fund.
QUESTION:

Would you agree, Mr. Bailey, that the

Oregon Supreme Court construed and interpreted the meaning
in the way suggested by Mr. Neil, and nonetheless decided
in your favor?

As I understand it now, you’re submitting

to us that if that construction is correct, then it’s an
illegal payment.
MR. BAILEYs
that it doesn't.

if that does say that.

But we say

But let ma go back to answer your question,

Mr. Justice Stewart, that the Oregon Supreme Court, in its
opinion, spelled out that, first, the urging before that
Oregon Supreme Court was mostly Moglia, and the teachings
■ \

of Meglia»

And that was the urging there was that Moglia

says that you had to have an agreement in writing before
you could become — you could have benefits.

The Oregon

31
Supreme Court said, well, Moglia doesn't apply here because
Walsh does have an agreement.

Therefore it couldn't operate.

Then they carea on this petition here, saying that,
well, look; because these people can't benefit, and there
is indication that they might benefit, then itEs in
violation

Article IV is in violation of 302.
We say that the trust agreement, which is the way

you determine how you're going to have benefits, that
trust agreement precludes that interpretation.
QUESTION:

But the Oregon Supreme Court seemed to

interpret the documents here as though the employees of
the sub were beneficiaries of the trust agreement,,
MR. BAILSY:
QUESTION;
MR. BAILEY;

Wall, if —
Do you agree with that?
Well, I'm not totally in agreement

with it, because the arguments —
QUESTION;

Well, it's not all that clear.

And I

just wondered if —
MR. BAILEY;

Right, correct.

It's not that clear,

because the Oregon Court said it didn't really have to
reach that, because in the teachings of the Kreindier v.
Clarise cases, and the Budget Dress, that an agreement
I

that provided the contractor sign an agreement to pay for
his own employees plus contractor employees under certain
circumstances was all right, because —

32

QUESTION?

But you agree now, as I understand you —

and you tell me if I misunderstand you — that -- you would
agree that the Oregon Supreme Court did have to reach that,
and that indeed is the dispositive issue in this case, isn’t
it?

Whether or not the employees of the sub were beneficiaries

of the trust agreement»
MR» BAILEY :

I don't think the Oregon Supreme

Court actually reached that —
QUESTION:

But isn’t that the dispositive issue in

this case?
MR» BAILEY:
QUESTION:

That's the dispositive issue -You and your brother agree on that, as

I understand it.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And you agree as to what the law is# as

I understand it.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You differ only as to what the precise

situation is in this case, isn’t that it?
MR. BAXLEY:

Right.

And that there is no showing

that there has been anybody that has not bean entitled to
receive benefits that has ever received them.
QUESTION:

Yes, but — I gather my brother Stewar

asked you if it were plain on the face of the documents that
the employer and the union actually agreed, and intended, to

have these payments made for the benefit of a non-union
subcontractor, would you agree —- I understand your answer
that that would be ar* illegal contract»
MR. BAILEY:
agree with that.

That that portion would, yes, I would

Because that's what it said.

QUESTION:

And you also agree, I take it, that

basically you're dealing with a prohibition that is across
the board.

And then there are exceptions to it.

And I

presume the burden is on he who wants to bring himself within
an exception.
MR. BAILEY:

That’s what we say, that ha has to show

that wa actually did pay out — the trust actually paid out
some money to somebody they shouldn’t have,
QUESTION:
The agreement.

No, no, no,

I think it’s the agreement.

What’s the construction in the collective

bargaining agreement?

If the parties said in so many words

we — I, the contractor, promise to pay on bahalf 6f, and
for the benefit of, the employees of non-union subcontractors
certain amounts of money, I take it you agree that would be
an illegal promise, ■
MR, BAILEY:
QUESTION:

If he said that, yes.
Do you concede that the basic language

of 302 that is meant here, that it was a payment to a
representative of any of his employees?
MR. BAILEY:

Well, we concede certainly that the

34

trusts are such representatives, because they are established
as a Taft-IIartley trust*
QUESTION:

We accept that.

We accept that.

Well, then, you have to bring yourself

within one of the exceptions, don't you?
MR. BAILEY:

Well, I'm saying — I wanted to qualify

my answer to you, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Go ahead.

MR. BAILEY:

The qualification is that, of course,

the CIAF is not such a Taffc-Hartiey trust.
QUESTION:

That is one out of the five.

MR. BAILEY:

One out of the five, yes.

Right, right.

Now to bring ourselves within the exceptions, the exceptions
are, of course, that the trust fund — and we5 re talking
about the exceptions of (c)(5) —- the trust funds must
be such that they do not make contributions to -- or
benefits to persons other than the employees of a contributing
employer.
QUESTION:

The traditional statute construction is

that the burden would be on. you to bring yourself within the
exception, is it not?
MR. BAILEY:

Well, counsel has never challenged the

validity of the trust fund.

At no time has he done that.

There has never been any challenge as to whether these trust
funds are lawful.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bailey, may I ask you a question?

35
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yas.
First of ail-, is the entire trust agree­

ment in the record?
MR. BAILEY:

No — yes,, sir, the trust agreements

are in the record, yes.
QUESTION:

And is it correct that an employes, in

order to be entitled to benefits, must v?ork a certain number
of years or something like that?

Is there a period that

must elapse before his rights vest?
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:
12 credits.

That's on the pension *
On the pension?
Right.

On the pension he must have

And that means 12 years of employment of certain

hours per year.
QUESTION:

So with respect to such an employee, there

might be contributions made for him for five years, and then
he might decide to gat out of carpentry and go into some
other industry.

He would never be a beneficiary of that

trust, then?
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

That’s right, under —Now is that also true of, say, the other

trusts?
MR. BAILEY:

The Health and Welfare runs on a

shorter period of time.

And that runs on our quarters,

saying that you receive the credit of 250 hours in a period

36

of three months.
QUESTION;

Then such a man could, perhaps, work

200 hours, and contributions be made on account of those 200
hours, but he never would get any benefit from that?
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Now is that same principle applicable

to all of the trusts?
MR. BAILEY:

All right.

The balance of the trust

is on the Health — or excuse, me on the Vacation, for those
who ara eligible under it.

The dollars that come in on Health

on the Vacation are allocable to an individual, and they are
also added to by earnings of the trust and the disposition
is made on a pro rata basis based on the amount of money
that comes in.
QUESTION:

But is there immediate vesting for — in

the Vacation Trust as soon as a man works for a few hours?
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:

If he is an employee ■—
If he's a covered employee?
Right.
Yes.
Right.

Immediately vested.

Now, if

you'd want the other two trusts you asked about.
QUESTION:
MR. BAILEY:

Yes.
On the Apprenticeship and Training, of

course, there's no •— there's no benefit that applies to

37

an employee, because the employee himself, he's working, you
see»

He's a contractor — I mean, he's a journeyman, and

he's on the job.

So he's not taking the benefit.

QUESTION:

The beneficiary is somebody entirely

different.
MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:
MR, BAILEY:

Yeah, he's not around.
Right.
And on the Construction Industry

Advancement, there's no beneficiaries of that except the
general public or what you will because it promotes the
industry,
QUESTION:

Right.

Let me ask one other question

to ba sure I have it in mind.

Assume there were an employee

of the general contractor in the past.

He had been in the

union, perhaps took a withdrawal, and was not working for
the general during the period involved in this lawsuit.

And

then he later — but he worked for a subcontractor — worked
for the sub, the non-union sub, then later got back into
the union.

I take it he would not get credit toward vesting

for the period he worked for the non-union employer.
MR. BAILEY:

He would not get credit for that

period, because those funds do not attache themselves to —
other than an employee or covered employer.
QUESTION:

Right.

I understand.

QUESTION:

How, I want to — in the Oregon — or

,

in the states.

38

Is it Oregon?

MR. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, it’s Oregon.
Yes.

The Oregon Supreme Court describes

this contract as saying, in this case the requirement of
the written contract was satisfied in that the defendant had
a written contract with the union which required that he make
contributions to the trust fund for his own employees? and
also specifically provided that in the event he engaged
a subcontractor to do any work covered by the agreement,
he would be liable for payment into the various trust funds
for the employees of such subcontractors.
ME. BAILEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's what it says.
Now, is that an interpretation of the

contract, that they ware agreeing to make payments on behalf
of, and for the benefit of, the employees of any subcontractor?
MR. BAILEY:

I, of course, cannot say precisely what

the Supreme Court of Oregon had in its mind.
QUESTION:

Well, it sounds that way.

It sounds more

like that way than any other way, doesn't it?
MR. BAILEY:

Yes.

It uses the word, for.

But if

it was applicable to the —
QUESTION:

Well, what does for mean?

MR. BAILEY:
these employees.

Well, it could be for the hours that

That’s generally what the reference means,

because the word, for these employees, under Article IV, could

39
apply to benefits fco those people, as we've just demonstrated,
for the Apprenticeship and the Vacation
QUESTION;

or the CIAF.

You think that — what you're really

saying is that these people knew what they ware doing.
They were not making an illegal contract.
MR. BAILSY:

That's what I'm saying, yes.

That

the intent of the labor agreement was to produce money for
the —• to support the trust fund.

The intent and purpose

of the trust funds is to say what to do with that money.
And that5 s what

we5 re saying is, that you have to look

if you're going to gat benefits, you have to look at the
trust fund for that purpose; that the only real purpose of
the contract, the labor agreement, was to supply the money.
And that was the method in which it was supplied.
If I may, in closing, state that we emphasize that
there was, despite any testimony otherwise and any testimony
in this record that is in contravention of the requirements
both of the law and the trust agreements, that in those
circumstances, the — it must comply with the law.

And that

there is no proof in this record that any individual has
received any benefits who is not entitled to them under
the lax-?.

And we think that that was a matter of proof that

the petitioner had to make.

And we say that the decision

of the Oregon Sxxpreme Court should be affirmed..
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Bailey.

Mr. Nail, do you have anything further?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP CARL R, NEIL, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEIL:
Justice.

I have two or three points, Mr. Chief

fir. Justice Y'7hite extracted the concession from

counsel that the payments required under counsel's theory
of the case for a non-union signatory employee are not
necessary to the integrity of the trust fund.

That’s an

Important point, I think, because argument is made othewise
in the brief of the respondent.
There is no evidence in this record of any actuarial
assumptions of any of the trust funds.

Furthermore, the

texts cn pensions and pension planning cited by respondent
do not disclose that any such actuarial assumptions are
made.

There are a lot of actuarial assumptions made, but

they’re all made on how many covered employees are there,
how many hours are they going to work, this kind of thing.
They do not make the kind of actuarial assumptions that says
there's going to be so much penalty contributions, or so
many contributions that aren’t related to particular employees
QUESTION:

Well, really, that's no business of the

statute or of this court, is it?
MR. NEIL:

I don't think so, but the argument

QUESTION:

The actuarial soundness of the trust

fund, is it?
MR. NEIL:

I agree.

But counsel made the point

41
that the actuaries — counsel suggests that the actuaries
might have assumed, that there’s going to be a certain
level of penalty contributions made into the trust,, and
that may be necessary for the soundness of the trust.

I'm

saying that's not the case.
Mr, Justice Rehnquist raised the question, I think ,
first of whether state lav; might control trust instructions»
The Oregon Supreme Court's opinion does not directly construe
the trust agreement except by implication in its comments on
Article IV.

And if it can be said to have construed the

trust agreement by its comments on Article IV, it construed
them in our favor.
In addition to the point ma.de by Mr. Justice White
about the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion, I draw your attention
to page 34 of the appendix to our brief, another portion of
the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion, in the first full
paragraph, where they are stating the question as presented
to the Oregon Supreme Court on this issue.

And they say,

defendant's first contention on cross appeal is that the
subcontractor's clause of the labor agreement violates
29 U»SiC. §186

that's 302 — to the extent that it may

be applied to require defendant to make contributions to
union trust funds quote for the benefit of employees other
than his own as pleaded in defendant's fifth affirmative
defense.

I suggest that's further evidence that they thought
they were deciding the case below on the basis of the
construction that Article IV did require contributions for
