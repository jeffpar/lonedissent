MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 76-15, Continental T.V. v. GTE Sylvania.
Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN E. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MILLER;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This is a private 'treble damage antitrust action brought under section
16 of the Clayton Act.

1 of the Sherman Act and sections 4 and
The case involves the television in­

dustry and a conspiracy between a manufacturer and its dealers
to utilize a resale location restriction, as a device to achieve
restricted territories and forced against the petitioner at
the insistence of a protected dealer.
The manufacturer is GTE Sylvania, which i:n 1962 in­
stalled its so-called "elbow room" plan under which goods were
sold on the oral understanding that dealers could resell only
at locations approved by Sylvania.

The franchise in this case

was a mere selling agreement that expressly limited th® dealer
relationship to that of vendor-vendee, and it expressly denied
the right of the dealer to hold himself out as a Sylvania
representative.
The anti-competitive purpose, of Sylvania5 s resale
location restrictions were apparent.

As quoted from their own

4
sales manuals, it gave every dealer a geographic! area within
which to sell.

It franchised dealers fay territory.

ated same-brand competition.
cutting.

It elimin­

And it eliminated vicious price

In short,. Sylvania’s purpose was to close territories.
QUESTION:

Are you telling us that there were lines

drawn or that this is the practical consequence of the location
control?
MR. MILLER:

We are saying that to say that in Schwinn,

for instance, Schwinn drew lines around territories, where in
/

Sylvania's case it drew, with the help of economic limitations,
it drew lines around store locations which is a distinction
without, a difference.

They both had the same announced purpose,

to eliminate same-brand competition, and both had the same
effect, where dealers like Continental were foreclosed from
territories.
So wa are saying that was the purpose and effect and
the use of their device,which was illegal under Schwinn and
Topco.

The effect, of Sylvania’s market restriction was as

clear as its purpose really, in that Sylvania utilized the
economic limitations of retail distribution in combination with
its resale location restraint to effectively control inter­
brand competition.

And this is because dealer outreach, that

is the effective radius of marketing from any given location,
is limited.

In fact, it was conceded in this case throughout

that a dealer can market effectively only within 25 to 50 miles

5
of his store location.
So by allowing a dealer to resell only from a
specific location spaced more than fifty miles from a given
territory,, Sylvania achieved closed territories.
Nov;, if you look at the effect of this practice in
Sacramento, you will see that it was dramatic in impact.
Before "elbow room" there was some 19 dealers handling Sylvania
products in a metropolitan area, of about 500, 000 people.

After

"elbow room" and during a rapid build-up of color TV demand,
there was only Handy Andy.

Handy Andy had become by use of

Sylvania's resale restrictions a virtual monopolist in his
brand in the territory.
Continental T.V. is a retail dealer which began
dealing with Sylvania in 1964.
Sylvania*s largest dealers.

By 1965, it had become one. of

At Sylvania's insistence,

Continental accepted credit through■Sylvania's financing agent,
Maguire & Company, and as Continental's sales increased, so
too did its credit line, ultimately reaching $350,000.
Continental also expanded geographically with
Sylvania sponsored credit.

Continental was able, to grow from

two stores in 1964 to eight approved store locations in 1965.
It was then doing business in fiv© northern California cities,
and it had sales in excess of a million dollars a year.
Now, by August of 1965, Continental saw that entry
into the Sacramento market would be profitable., and it notified

6

Sy.lvars.ia that it was opening a stor® in that territory.
Sylvania's response was immediate and unequivocal.

Continental

was told that it could not sell Sylvania products in Sacramento
due to previous commitments that had been made to Handy Andy,
and further told that if it attempted to do so it was jeopard­
izing its entire future.
Upon advice of its attorneys, however, Continental
T.V. informed Sylvania that it was moving some of its own mer­
chandise to Sacramento for resale.
to this was also immediate.

Now, Handy Andy8s response

He demanded of Sylvania that

Continental's merchandise be removed from Sacramento, and
Sylvania delivered that massage to Continental and threatened
to hold back pending orders if Continental persisted.

Nevertheless, Continental held firm and did open for
business in Sacramento on September 7, 1965.

At Handy Andy's

insistence, Sylvania then retaliated, first by withholding two
large orders that Continental had pending on the fictitious
grounds that there was a. credit review; next, by refusing to
take any further orders and by instructing its sales and credit
departments to have no further communication whatsoever with
Continental.
Continental did hold firm, however, and stayed in
Sacramento, even after being told by Sylvania that if it did
so "there won't be any more Continental T.V."

Therefore,

Sylvania took immediate steps aimed at putting Continental out

7
of business.

It immediately cut off Continental’s credit,, it

directed Maguir© to bring suit for sums not yet due, it
caused inventory to be repossessed, locking and chaining
Continental's main stores and warehouse, it attached
Continental's bank accounts, causing the loss of its bank
credit, refused to honor credits due Continental, and it
disparaged Continental's credit with its other major supplier.
Finally, of course, on October 13, some 36 days
later after the opening in Sacramento, Continental was termin­
ated as a Sylvania dealer.
Now, Justice. Clark, sitting as trial judge, specific­
ally declared in Finding No. 15 that these acts were not as
Sylvania claimed, taken because of concern about Continental’s

finances# its credit status or any alleged failure to make
timely payments.

In Finding No. 16, Justice Clerk declared

that Sylvania. "s action was part and parcel of a conspiracy
between Sylvania and its dealers and forced ah the insistence
of Handy Andy against Continental to prevent Continental from
selling Sylvania products in Sacramento.
Now, Sylvania!s attack on Continental was successful.
It came at a time when due to an unprecedented demand for
color TV, manufacturers could not provide adequate inventory
to their existing dealers, let alone add new dealers, and
Continental was unable therefore to replace its supply that
had been cut off by Sylvania and was forced to close its chain

8

of stores.
Now, the jury is. this case was asked to decide only
two issues:

First, whether or Sylvania's resale location re­

straint was used as a device to close the Sacramento territory
to Continental;

and, secondly, whether Sylvania’s action

against Continental was for legitimate credit reasons as
claimed or was at the insistence of Handy Andy in reprisal for
selling Sylvania products in Sacramento.
Nov;, Justice Clark properly gave a Schwinn instruc­
tion.

He repeatedly instructed the jury that it was unlawful

for a manufacturer, having parted with title and risk respect­
ing a product, to thereafter restrict the territories within

which a dealer can resell, and concluded by stating that there­
fore in this case it would he unlawful for Sylvania to restrict
Continental’s outlets or store locations.
Now, since the only market here involved was
Sacramento, and since Sylvania admittedly refused to allow a
Continental store any closer than San Francisco, to so restrict
Continental's outlets and store locations in this case was
necessarily to restrict it or foreclose it from the territory
of Sacramento.
But the territorial restrictions and not the lawful­
ness of a resale location restraint standing alone was the
issue given a jury is certainly clear from both the argument
of Continental and the argument of Sylvania to the jury, and

9

is also clearly the basis for the jury verdict in Continental!s
favor in the trial court.
The majority below has accepted Sylvania’s disregard
for these findings and for -the evidence supporting the verdict
and has reversed the Continental judgment.

Both in effect

argue first that the form and effect of Sylvania's restraint
makes Schwinn inapplicable; and, secondly, that Schwinn is
simply bad law and should be overruled.
We believe that neither of these arguments are mer­
itorious.

The narrow issue presented here in our view is

whether, as the jury and the court found, Sylvania's usa of
its resale location restraint as a device to restrict terri­
tories is banned by Schwinn's per sa rule.

The decision of

this issue in our view requires only a pedestrian application
in Schwinn doctrine to clearly established facts.
Now, Schwinn of course holds that once a manufacturer
has parted with title and risk, he has parted with dominion
over the product, and that any effort thereafter to restrict
«

territory or persons to whom the product may be transferred is
a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act.
Now, it is elementary that purpose and effect and not
the form is the crucial inquiry.

The fact that, as I have

expressed before, that Schwinn used lines around territories,
and Sylvania with the help of economic limitations kept
Continental far enough away from Sacramento by drawing a line

10
in essence around his store location is indeed in our view a
distinction without a difference, because the announced purpose
was the same, elimination of inter-brand competition, and the
effect was the same.

Continental was foreclosed from the

territory.
Sylvania claims that dealers could sell to anyone
and here but necessarily ignores what happened in Sacramento.
Sylvania and the majority also ignore these crucial findings
and the evidence supporting the verdict.

For example, they

assume throughout that Sylvania acted only unilaterally, when
the jury necessarily and the court expressly found that
Sylvania acted.in concert with Handy Andy, and at Handy Andy’s
insistence foreclosed the territory to Continental.
Now, significantly, Sylvania admits that the mere
existence of their vertical restraint itself reflects the fact
%

that the dealer spacing they are talking about was given as a
bargained for benefit to the dealers in return for the dealers 5
promise to handle their line.

Yet they ignore the strong

horizontal impact of their system of restraint long held to be
per- se and legal.
Now, whether vertically imposed or horizontally
effected, restraints on territories and customers do in fact
have the same effect and hence the same rule should apply.

Novi, this identity of effect was first enunciated by
this Court in the resale maintenance context in 1911, the

11
Dr. Miles case.

The Court in Dr. Miles said in effect, the

manufacturer cannot impose a vertical restraint which its
dealers could not lawfully effect horizontally.
QUESTION?

Mr. Miller, could I interrupt you?

MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Surely.
What about a restraint on the character

of the place of business that the retailer operates, it has to
have so much square-footage or keep the windows clean or some­
thing like that?
MR. MILLER:

They have to do a certain amount of ad­

vertising, they have to have so many sets on your floor, that
kind of —QUESTION:

Well, they have to have a place of business

of a certain size, to be specific.
MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor, I think there is no

question that certain behavioral controls that are only inhibitiv© instead of being prohibitive should be allowed, and
certainly should be tasted under the rule of reason.
some of the things mentioned are in that category.

I think
Certainly

a manufacturer should be allowed to —
QUESTION:

Well, how do you. reconcile that with the

language of Schwinn, if the covenant is you may not resell
this -- after you have bought it, you may not resell it from a
place of business of less than a thousand square-feet?
MR. MILLER:

All right.

I don't think that couched

12
in those prohibitory terms that it would pass muster, but I
do believe that a manufacturer should have some roan to require
some standard of advertisement, perhaps on a co-op basis,
where each dealer is on a pro rata basis is required to pay
into a local regional fund of some kind, or that certain kinds
of facilities could be required, certain kinds of full-line
displays be required.
QUESTION:

Wall, what was your answer about my

thousand square-foot restriction?
MR. MILLER:

If th® restriction is that once you buy

my set you cannot resell it unless you do so from a store that
has a thousand square-feet at least, I think that that should
bs per se illegal under the Schwinn doctrine.
QUESTION:

What if you. can't resell it; from a place

of business that is not kept neet and orderly and clean and
the windows washed and so forth?
MR. MILLER:

I think now you are getting close:: to

the more inhibitive and not so much the prohibitive test.

I

don't think it is a question of whether we are talking about
a rule of reason approach or a per se approach.

I think that,

the principal distinction is between clauses like location
practice without a resale restraint, which the automobile in­
dustry has used for years, and such things as primary responsi­
bility clauses which have been used for years, which are in­
hibitive.

They do inhibit either behavior, but they have long

13
been tested under the rule of reason.

are prohibitive.

Those

A dealer —

QUESTION:

Well, what is the distinction between in-

hibitive and prohibitive?

I understand the word and I want to

fa® sure where you ar© drawing the Schwinn line.
MR. MILLER:

Right.

An inhibitive restraint in the

way I am using the term means that a dealer is inhibited to
some extent in his behavior vis-a-vis handling a. product of a
manufacturer but is not prohibited from where he will sell, to
whom he will sell, and basically not prohibited in terms of

his freedom to

do

what, where and

how he pleases with that

product he has purchased.
In other words, the distinction I have in mind is
the difference between saying you cannot, go into the Sacramento
territory and sell this product and saying you must us© your
best efforts in your own territory before you can justify
going into Sacramento.

If you do X, you can do Y, is inhibitive.

If you cannot do Y under any circumstances, that is prohibitive.
QUESTION:

No such distinction as that was made in

Schwinn, was there?
MR. MILLER:

In Schwinn, of course, we have a cas®

where the District Court found a horizontal division of

14
divisiori, of territories between the dealers and the issues
before the Supreme Court as I understood the case, number one
was the type of rule to apply to the consignment, sal© and
whether or not the customer restrictions should be treated on
a per se basis.
1 think that whether or not it is enunciated ex­
plicitly , -there is no question but that the cases have treated
these types of restraints on a prohibitive/inhibitive basis.
In other words, areas or primary responsibility, passover
clauses, exclusive dealerships, true location franchising,
all these things if reasonably used are lawful because —
QUESTION;

Under the ancient rule against restraints

on alienation, upon which Schwinn’s per se rule relied, there
is no room really, is there, for the distinction you make be­
tween inhibition or prohibition?
MR. MILLER;

I think there is, Your Honor, because

there is no restraint on the dealer in these inhifoitive-type
devices.

In other words, with a true location clause, where

the dealer is told you may locate your store here, you must
locate your store her© with this franchise, ha has not “taken
the next step and told he. cannot sail from any other location
or he can't sell to some group of customers.

If that next

step is not taken, you don’t have a restraint on the dealer
and you don’t have a restraint on alienation.

But if you do

take the next step, Schwinn and Topco and Dr. Miles say that

15
you can’t do -chat because it is a restraint on alienation
and indeed the independent should remain independent.
QUESTION:

But Topco was a horizontal agreement,

wasr.! t it?
MR. MILLER:

Your Honor, Topco involved both ver­

tical and horizontal territorial restraints.

Topco members

engaged in retailing, were restricted to territories allocated
to them horizontally, but Topco members involved in wholesaling
were required to restrict their dealers vertically to the same
territories to which they have been allocated.

And in recog­

nizing the identity of the effect, the Topco court says at
page 612, and I quote, "Just as the territorial restrictions on
retailing Topco brand products must fall, so must territorial
restraints cm wholesaling.

The considerations axe the same.

And the Sherman Act requires identical results."
QUESTION:

But. at page 608, the opinion said, "We

think that it is clear that the restraint in
this case is a
;
horizontal one and therefore a per* sa violation."
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

That’s right, Your Honor.

Yes, indeed.

So I guess you could taka either one you

want to?
MR. MILLER:

You take either one you want, I suppose.

But indeed the facts indicate that there was a vertical, there
was a horizontal restraint, and that the language of the court
at least in some sections, and tha holding certainly can be

16

read clearly to b® that, like Schwixm, you cannot restrain
dealer behavior.

Like Schwirm, once the product is sold to

that dealer, it is a per s© violation to restrict territories
or customer groups or persons to whom the product can be
transferred.
Th© argument Sylvania makes, that once franchised
everywhere franchised, is really beside the point because the
point is that once franchised you can sell anywhere.

We ar©

not saying, nor have we ever claimed that we were authorised,
let's say in San Francisco, so therefore we should b® able to
be a franchised dealer ©very place sis© that we chose.

We

have never made that contention.
What our contention has been from the start, however,
is this, that once franchised as a dealer we should b© able to
take those products and sell them in any territory or to any
group of parsons w® wish.
Obviously, Sylvania cannot restrict a stranger from
obtaining Sylvania products from us or anyone else.

That is

per se violative ©£ the Schwinn doctrine and the Topco doctrine.
Obviously also, Sylvania likewise can't restrict Continental
T.V. from selling to any particular customer, whether it be a
stranger dealer or to itself, and thus this franchised every­
where franchised anywhere argument boils down to a recognition
of the market fact that, authorised somewhere you can sell
anywhere under the Schwinn and Topco doctrines.

17
So it is only by forgetting their conspiracy and by
forgetting its post-sale nature of the restraint and by
forgetting the strong horizontal impact associated with its
practice of restraint that SyXvania can find refuge in the
case law.
They cite and argue and rely on the auto dealer
cases, but the auto dealer cases are location clause cases.
They do not ha/e a post-sale restraint and the judges in those
cases go out of their way to explain that the dealer could
sell anywhere and to anyone.
action.

They don't involve any concerted

They are all unilateral cases.

And, moreover, it

seems that General Motors -QUESTION;

Well, they are a concerted action in the

Albrecht sensef aren't they?
MR. MILLER:

In the Albrecht sense they would have

concerted action by just
QUESTION:

So you always have concerted action when

i

you have a buyer and a- sellar?
MR. MILLER;

That's right.

But the significant point

with these auto dealer casas is that General Motors used an
area of primary responsibility clause in them, has never
found in the last twenty-five years that the use of a true
location practice without a post-sale restraint has impeded
the effectiveness of their marketing programs, even though
they abuse the location practice without more in an area of

18
responsibility.

It has been certainly effective for them and

it would certainly be effective for other concentrated in-'
dustries like the television industry.
The other line of cases which are mentioned are the
exclusive franchising cases.

And I think that all need be

said there is that Sylvania8s practice is at the other extreme.
The exclusive franchise case is simply a case where the manu­
facturer appoints on© dealer in a territory and premises that
dealer h© will not appoint another.

But he doesn’t put any

restraint, on the dealer that he appoints or on any other
dealer in any other area.
Now, they argue, SyIvania argues and the majority
argues that there must b® soma inherent right to restrict out­
side dealers from coming in in order for the manufacturer to
keep his premise.

Well, obviously there is no inherent right

or the exclusive dealers would not have to usa areas of pri­
mary responsibility, yet all these cases involve the. uss of
that less restrictive restraint, inhibit,ive restraint.
Now, just, at this point, if

I may, Your Honor, I

would like -to reserve my remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. LAURENCE POPOFSKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. POPOFSKY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

19
th© Court;
In the trial court, the plaintiffs, Continental T.V.
pressed a claim against Sylvania for willful and malicious
injury to Continental’s business.

I am happy that

Sylvan,la won something before th© jury that.

Therefor©, fch©

only issue really before tills Court is th© on© that was iso­
lated in the jury instructions on th© claims which Sylvani®
lost, end ‘that was isolated in a jury instruction which was a
par se instruction derived from Schwinn which expressly stated
unequivocally that restraints of the locations clause character
ware legal per se.
lost that issue.

That issue went to the jury and Sylvania
That jury instruction was the focus of the

appeal to the Ninth Circuit and we think the Ninth Circuit,
operating within the framework of stare decisus, correctly
analysed the distinctions between the Sylvania practice on the
on© hand and Schwinn on the other and determined that there
war© significant and sufficient distinctions to take th©
Sylvania locations practice outside the technical ambit of
Schwinn.
By way of brief recapitulation, th© Ninth Circuit
majority hold that, as they road Schwinn, leaving aside for a
moment th® restraint on alienation language and its full
breadth, that what it was really striking at was a very rigid
compartment®lization in a vertical sens© of a distribution
system which did have th© affect of completely banning all

20

potential intra-brand competition.

As the Ninth Circuit

viewed it, that was so adversa that it was appropriately held
per se illegal or at least they wouldn't address that ques­
tion and that the Sylvania practice was in all ©vents differ­
ent.
As they looked at the Sylvania practice and as they
look®:! at th© record before, the court, what it showed was that
a struggling manufacturer, with on© to two percent of th©
market in television, decided that they had to do something t©
survive, something to stay in th® market, something to stay an
effective intra-brand competitor, and that it did tea one
thing that a rational manufacturer would do.

It tried to in­

due© its dealers to carry th© line, it triad to accord to its

distribution units, th® dealers, some incentive to try and
carry Sylvania so that they could competitive effectively with
RCA and Zenith.
question?

what was th.® incentive extended?

MR. POFOFSKYs

Th© incentive extended was the notion

that Sylvania would adopt a vertical distribution system which
would cut down th® number of authorised dealers, thereby pro­
ducing &n inhibition, if you want to call it that, or at least
a lessening of intra-brand competition, which I presume in an
economic sense would provide th© dealer with the potential for
higher volume and presumably more profit.
QUESTION:

So you don’t contend that th© purpose

21
arid effect ws

not to inhibit intra-brand?

MR. POPOFSKY:

oh, no.

I think we have to take these

words "purpose and effect" —
QUESTION:

And —

MR. POPOFSKY: — to look at then either- broadly or
narrowly.
QUESTION:

And so it is just a question of to what

extent it may inhibited before it is illegal?
MR. POPOFSKY:

Well, I think I would look at this

way, the broad purpose and the broad effect was to further
inter-brand competition.

The technique chosen had the purpose

and the effect of trying to limit intra-brand competition.
From the Ninth Circuit’s perspective, operating from the four
corners of the Schwinn decision, they perceived a significant
and sufficient difference, one.- if you will, of degree, that
Sylvania made no attempt at all whatsoever to absolutely stop
intra-brand competition.

Its locations practice produced a

lessening in the number of dealers.

It want down in San

Francisco, it, went down in New York, it went down in St. Louis,
all the major metropolitan areas, and in Sacramento, while it
want down from 19 to I think the record shows 3, rather than
one, but we will not quibble about that, it went down, the
market share went down.

Sylvania 8 s dealer's in Sacramento —

and let’s call it Handy Andy all by itself,

if you will —

yielded 13 percent of the inter-brand market to Sylvamia in

22
Sacramento, compared to a nationwide average of 4 or 5 per­
cent.

For a struggling manufacturer, that is remarkable

and
QUESTION:

What was the previous share?

MR. POPOFSKY;
QUESTION:

In Sacramento, it was —

Two percent?

MR. POPOFSKY:

Two percent, one or two peccent.

So

by cutting down the number of dealers and by in effect saying
Handy Andy, you promote us, we will improve our competitive
potential inter-brand, that is what happened precisely in
Sacramento.

It also happened elsewhere, but it didn’t happen

so well in San Francisco.
QUESTION:

It may have been just a good product.

MR. POPOFSKY:
QUESTION:

There they only got —

Pardon?

It may have been just a good product.

MR. POPOFSKY:
and cause and effect, is,

It may have been just a good product,
I suppose, always difficult in cir­

cumstances like this, Justice White.

I think it is a good

product, but it takes more I think than a good product to sell
TV sets.

You don’t know what it would have been if

That was the nature of the business

And whether or not we can say in retrospect if they

it was intelligent for Sylvania to make the judgment it did and
to try and stay in th© market by limiting, if you will, the

decided they would take on Young Brothers.

Well, Young

Brothers was the kind of competitor which Continental T.V.
didn't, want in San Francisco.

So, exercising its right of

dealer independence, if you will, Continental T.v. said, well,
if you take on Young Brothers, we are going to get out of the
San Francisco market.

And I think, there is more than a sugges­

tion in this record that everything that happened in Sacramento
was in retaliation, that Continental T.V., believing there were
options available to it, believing it could force a weak manu­
facturer such as Sylvan!a to follow its will, simply said we
will open in Sacramento and let’s see if you have the wisdom to
do something about it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Popofsky, if I remember Idle franchise

agreement correctly, Syivania did not in writing commit itself
not to open additional dealerships, did it?
MR. POPOFSKY:

It did not.

It made no commitment in

writing, but the record vmg unequivocal that it announced an
“elbow room" practice in nice sales jargon to reflect what was
a locations practicet

There was no question that all dealers

were authorized to sell only from designated or approved

25
locations.

The jury I think under those instructions must be

assumed to have found that there was in fact a further agree­
ment .
QUESTION;

restriction on the dealer, but what is the character of the
evidence showing the commitment,

ing franchised dealers maximum sales potential, I suppose that

MR. POPOFSKY:

Maximum sales potential, yes.

I think

that is about the —
QUESTION;

But that is the closest thing there is to

it?

MR. POPOFSKY:

That's correct.

And conversely I would

say that any dealer, including Continental T.V., had the oppor­
tunity on ten days notice to tear up the franchise agreement
and buy Philco, which was then still in business, and to buy
RCA and to buy Zenith.

It was a two-way street, it worked both

ways, and Continental walked both sides of the street, as this
record demonstrates, and that is part of the reason why we
think that when we go beyond the Ninth Circuit in the star©

26
decisus perspective and we take the literal language of Schwinn
and we apply it to a locations practice and we say its full
breadth would indeed strike it because a locations practice is
on any word inhibitory, prohibitory, whatever, it is a postsals restraint, then we do in fact invite -this Court to re­
examine Schwinn.

And it is to that now that I would like to

address myself and going beyond now the Ninth Circuit perspec­
tive .
QUESTION;

Just before you do, I take it there is no

— it may have been impractical for a dealer to solicit out­
side close to another dealer's location, but legally he was
free to do so?
MR. POPGFSKY:

Legally ha v/as free to do so.

In any

metropolitan area - in a locations practice such as Sylvania or
any other of which we are aware, 'there are always multiple
dealers.

It is only in the rare circumstance where you have

got smaller communities where you end up with just one dealer
being authorized.

In Salinas, California, for example, there

was only one dealer; that was authorized, and it was Continental
T.V.

They had a "monopoly" inter-brand in Salinas.

In

Sacramento, they say that is what happened, Handy Andy yielded
— it was a bigger market, but Handy Andy was yielded a monopoly
they say, in Sacramento.
But in the major metropolitan areas, the natural re­
sult is that you have fewer but still several dealers who do in

27
fact compete with on© another , and that is in this record.
QUESTION:

Arid who advertise city-wide;?

MR. POPOFSKY:

Advertise city-wide, have th© right to

advertise city-wide., and indeed Continental if it could
economically have done so -QUESTION:

And deliver city-wide?

MR. POPOFSKY:

And deliver city-wide.

The record

shows, for example, that Continental T.V. did advertise pretty
extensively in northern California and that it did make sales
and deliveries in more than fifty miles from its particular
stores.

Its practice was to send salesmen out and show the

sets in the homes, and it had quite an outreach beyond th©
normal just walk-in trade.

of

any

kind and

But there was in fact no contractual,
character to sales 50 or 100 or 200

But no one I think has ever deceived themselves

into thinking that a dealer in Chicago could sell in New York.
That is just not practical.

And -that, of course, was the whole

point of a locations practice, was to cut down th® number of
dealers.
Weill, now I would like to move, if I could, directly

to the Schwinn per s© rule and its language because w© think,
as suggested throughout these proceedings, mostly in footnotes
in th© lower courts, of course, that Schwinn ought to be re­
considered.

And as I indicated previously, in our judgment

th© Schwinn language is capable, if read broadly, of reading on

28
a locations practice.

So if we read it that way and read it

beyond 'the Ninth Circuit interpretation, which we would urge
upon this Court as correct, then we come to this:
In Schwinn, this Court flatly recognized, as w® read
•the opinion and as Justice Stewart noted in the dissent, that
the overall effect of Schwinn's distribution system was in
fact pro-competitive viewed in the inter-brand sens®? that
although it was restrictive, although it was very tightly re­
strictive in its compartmsntalization at the distributorship
level, it. nonetheless furthered inter-brand competition.

There

the inter-brand competition cam© from the so-called mass mer­
chandisers, Sears’s, Penny's, Wards, and from what were than
the rather cheaper Japanese imported bicycles.
Nonetheless, this Court felt that it was appropriate
to strike on a per s© basis those restraints which went beyond
what they viewed as the reasonable way to compete, and it did
so on the basis of the: per so language which is, of course:, all
familiar to you.
Now, the only way we think it appropriate to read
that result, in light of the conceded benefits to inter-brand
competition which resulted from fcha Schwinn system, is to look
for a non-@conomic justification, and we have advanced one in
our brief, and that non-economic justification seems to our
mind to b® that this Court, in its per ss language and its
articulation based on the restraint of alienation, was saying

29
that dealer sovereignty or dealer freedom of choice, if you
will, is the paramount antitrust value which a legal system
under the antitrust laws ought to further in vertical distri­
bution relationships.
That way, it seems to us, the dissent can be recon­
ciled with the majority, and it seems to us, too, that the
particular language of the per se rule begins to make sense
insofar as it distinguishes on the one hand between sales and
on the other hand between consignments and agency relation­
ships.
What is the result of that?

The result of that is,

it seems to us, that it has distorted antitrust values, that
what it has dons is it has said that although there are legiti­
mate inter-brand competitive concerns.
a central concern?

Indeed, competition is

nonetheless, we will take one from the

many and isolate that as the primary concern, namely the
! dealer, and the consequence, of that is in our judgment clearly,
unequivocally harm to inter-brand competition, harm to the
ability of manufacturers to compete on a near:-brand basis, and
harm t.o th© consumer.
What it really yields is the notion:

one® a dealer

is authorized somewhere, th® par se language of Schwinn means
that he is authorized everywhere.

Now, let me test that, if I

can, with Your Honors, because I think it is tantamount t© say­
ing that trad® must follow th® flag, that if Continental T.V.

30
chooses to plant its flag in Sacramento or anywhere else,
Sylvania is obligated to deal with it there or anywhere ©Isa a
Now,

I heard Mr. Miller say, well, perhaps Sylvania

would not. have to deal with the dealer in Sacramento, it would
have to ships perhaps to it in San Francisco and then
Continental 1!.V. could take care of the transshipment to
Sacramento.
It is perfectly obvious tinder that system that
Sylvania sets ar® going to be sold from an unauthorized loca­
tion by Continental, holding itself out as a seller of
Sylvania sets in Sacramento.

But more, what about volume?

Must Sylvania continue to supply volume in San Francisco suf­
ficient to transship it to Sacramento?
Why, surely if Sylvania did not, if w© said we will
cap on a lid on volume, we will b® said to have been restrain­
ing the freedom of the dealer to do as he wants to with goods,
it will ba somehow impairing the relationship, the dealer
freedom will be in fact impaired.
And what about credit, one© he moves into Sacramento?
Is Sylvania, who had bsen authorizing the credit, going to be
required to finance the credit s© that the merchandise

wanted

in Sacramento can be had?
It seems to us that in fact what really is being
urged by the application her© to a locations practice of the
per se rule of Schwinn, is that once you ere a dealer, you are

31

a dealer everywhere, that the manufacturer is obligated to
deal with you, and hs cannot effectively cut you off.
Under Albrecht, it is inconceivable that this Court
or any ether would not find some form of concerted action.
Indeed, that was tried to the jury here and it was perfectly
clear from the evidence that a jury could possibly find that
in the realtionships between any manufacturer and dealer,
one® they started buying and selling, that there is concerted
action.

And then, of course., is the irony qifl'th©

If a stranger cam® to Sylvania in Sacramento

and said, I want your goods, I want to buy Sylvania and I want
to hold myself up as a Sylvania dealer in Sacramento, Colgate
would provide a valuable and meaningful tool for saying no, I
have the right as a manufacturer of dealer selection, I can
under the antitrust laws determine who is going to buy where
and who is going to sail where, and that, is a legitimate tool
of intar-brand competition.

Colgate would say w© could say

that to a stranger but does it really make sense for Schwinn
to say, no, you cannot say that to an existing dealer, an
existing dealer who once franchised scsaewhere because of the
language,
the particular language of the Schwinn opinion, with
*
its questionable historic antecedence, I would respectfully
submit, that that particular language compels Sylvania to

continue doing dealer business, no matter what the dealer
does, no matter what the character of the business of the
dealer,
There are, after all, a number of ways the dealer
can change his business operations.

a little too much?

MR. POPOFSKY;

I think there should b© thousands of

reasons why.
QUESTION;

But do you think Schwinn gives a guarantee

that no matter what he does?
MR. POPOFSKY;

I would hop© not, Your Honor, but I

think we are right back to the question —
QUESTION:

I think really you are saying that the —

wouldn't it ha more accurate to say your argument is that, read
the way your opponent roads Schwinn, it would prohibit the
manufacturer from terminating a dealer for selling too much
marchandise?
MR. POPOFSKY;

I would think, Your Honor, that the

33

way -chat the opposition reads Schwinn raises the spectre that
any number of heretofore acceptable reasons for dealer termin­
ation are now suspect, because all, despite this inhibitory
language, all ar© capable of being read as in some way restrict­
ing the dealer's economic freedom to sell to whom and where
and in the manner h® might choose.

It really depends on whether

you want to read Schwinn as broadly as some trial courts have,
and hav© suggested that if you have $25 you must sell.

If you

ar© going to read it as broadly as that, then I dar© say you
really hav© deprived the manufacturer of ©very tool available
to further inter-brand competition.
On the other hand, if you do read it more narrowly
and try to approach it the way the Ninth Circuit did, I think
what you would conclude is that there are a number of vertical
practices that ought not and were not struck down by Schwinn.
On® would be a locations practice, I would submit.
would be an exclusive dealing practice.

Another

Historically, there

has been no procedant, no precedent which has suggested that
the normal traditional tool of established and exclusive dis­
tributorships in the name of furthering your inter-brand
competitive potential, absent monopoly, so long as competing
brands are available, that that would be in any way illegal.
The purpose, the effect of that kind of distribution
system is substantially the equivalent of Sylvania.
QUESTION?

We can agree with you and affirm without

34
overruling Schwinn.
MR. POPOFSKY;

We can, Your Honor,

We would urge it.

W® would also urge the alternative, if for' any reason the
literal language of Schwinn were to be read as applicable to
a locations practice.

We do not stand before this Court and

invite the Court to overrule Schwinn easily.
QUESTION;

I thought that is what you war© doing.

MR. POPOFSKYs
QUESTION;

I am addressing the potential —

Unless I misunderstood you.

MR. POPOFSKY;

I am addressing the potential, Mr.

Justice Marshall, that a reading of Schwimi could b© sufficient
ly broad to literally strike a Sylvania practice.

If that were

the reading, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, and contrary to
the argument that w© have mad® at all stages in. this litigation
if that were the reading then w© would urge a re-examination of
Schwinn for all the reasons we've suggested.
QUESTION:

Tc warrant those location restrictions,

do they have to be Mposad wholly by the manufacturer or may
they be — can the scheme appear as a piece of paper and a map
signed by all the dealers and the manufacturer?
MR. POPOFSKY;

Well, if this particular type of ver­

tical restraint, a locations practice, or perhaps any other,
even a Schwinn type, ar© essentially the product of a dealer
originated scheme, let’s call it a — in the economic litera­
ture, Professor Posner particularly calls it a dealer

35
originated cartel — then I think a wholly different analysis
obtains,

Then you ~~
QUESTION:

Well, it may be a wholly different

analysis,, but how do you come out on it?
MR. POPOFSKYs

Well, how you erne out I think is

that th® Topco rule would strike it as a horizontal agreement,
and th© United States v. General Motors would strike it as a
horizontal agreement to which th© manufacturer had become th©
agent.
QUESTION:

Well, what about ~ what if th© proof was

that, although th© plan originated in the manufacturer, ©very
dealer surely knew about it, and whan you put on. a dealer h©
asks the manufacturer, well, where are my boundaries, where

MR. PQPOFSKY:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

So that in the long run you have a —

everybody is a party to th© agreement, all th.© dealers and the
manufacturer.
MR. POPOFSKY:

But there is I think a fundamental

difference in terms of where the plan originates, and th® dif­
ference is addressed by Professor Posner in his article we
cited, among other noted economists.

Th© difference is this:

If the. manufacturer is creating these vertical restraints,
these vertical distribution practices, which have as their
practice scan© kind of limitation upon intra-brand

competition

36

at the dealer level? the manufacturer is doing it? he is doing
it with the full realization that ha is increasing his costs
of getting the goods to the consumer? because the distribution
cost to the manufacturer can only have the effect of increas­
ing the cost to th® consumer and cutting down the manufacturer
sales.
\

So th® rational? necessary point of view of the
manufacturer is? I will concede to ths dealers th© minimum

QUESTIONs

Do you apply the same analysis to the re­

sale price maintenance?
MR. POPOFSKY:

I think you would have to.
There is no question that the legal

scholars have said that mafey of the arguments advanced in de­
fense of any vertical, territorial or customer restraint can
equally be advanced in favor of a resell price restraint.
I will, if I may, rely upon Mr. Justice Brennan's
concurring opinion in White Motor, in which he addressed that
very fact, that very contention, and expressly noted that there
was a fundamental difference in his view, and we endorse it,
between vertical resell price maintenance on the on® hand and
territorial restraints on the other, and that is that with a
price scheme you deprive the dealer of his ability to respond
to inter-brand competitive pressures.

Whs reass, with a terri­

torial practice, such as a locations practice, the dealer is
free to respond inter-brand as to price to any mov© by RCA,
Zenith or whatever.

QUESTION:

What would you say? counsel, about a

practice of which the manufacturer ownsd all the outlets and
buildings and th n required as part of the contract the arrange­
ment that they use these as the outlets?
MR. POPOFSKY:

You run into potential tie problems,

you run into potential exclusive dealing issues, but I don't
think that in and of itself would change vertical restriction
law particularly.

I would say that thar© is a natural conse-

queue© of iii© Schwinn rule which is a heightening or at least
a potential heightening of vertical integration by manufac­
turers , despite the assurances of the United States in Schwinn
that Schwinn would not vertically integrate.

It did proceed

to do precisely that in the face of the Schwinn ruling by
this Court.
So I think, if I may speak to Your Honor’s point,
that there is a danger if on© is as restrictive as Schwinn

40
appears literally to be in the vertical restraint area,, that
on® will compel manufacturers to vertically integrate, either
vertically integrate on the one hand or go out of business on
the other, which was Sylvania's problem.

As to the latter,

I would simply state that we have addressed two additional
issues, both of which ar© contingent, in our briefs, th®
failing company and the retroactive activity defense.

Popofsky, do you accept in this case as fact, given th® find­

decided to terminate its doing business with Continental but
that it was Handy Andy that — it was at Handy Andy *3 instrigation that Sylvania terminat® it?
MR. POPOFSKY:

Well, I think there is certainly

evidence in this record that Handy Andy complained.
no evidence beyond that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN E. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. MILLERs

Thank you.

It is, of course, the purpose and effect that we
view as important and not counsel’s argument that some
triviality may causes a cutoff on a dealer and rightfully so
under Schwinn.

We view Schwinn as saying that it is only

when the purpose and effect of whatever the control the manu­
facturer has over the dealer amounts to a restriction on the
territory or the customers that Schwinn and Topco forbid it.
And it is our case exactly that the purpose and
affect was to keep us out of Sacramento.

The Court need not

go beyond that narrow issue and go to the next step and ask
whether a restraint on the location without that purpose and
effect would also be illegal under Schwinn.

We &ra not neces

sarily arguing that, but, I think that it would follow because

43

I do a5t imagine a case where such restraint os?, location resale
would ba used without having the inevitable effect of restrict­
ing territory or customer.
Next, counsel says that this business of benefits to
inter-brand competition are important and that Schwinn, is
wrong, Tope© is wrong in holding to the contrary.

Wall, all I

can say on that, Your Honors, is that Topco says that interbrand benefits will not be considered where certain diminishmerit or destruction to intra-brand competition takes place.
But further than that, I think that testimony ©f
their own expect witness in this eas® I think illustrates the
wisdom ©f Topco.

Preston, their economic witness, testifies

that economic theory in its present state could not help decide
tit© question of whether there was any net pro-competitive gain
to inter-brand competition from the use of this restraint.

He

furthermore said he couldn't even tell whether there was a
necessary connection between the use of Sylvaaia’s restraint
and thoir ability to gain or hold their market share.

So that

the majority below really is saying this is a jury issue, whan
Sylvania's own expert witness could not answer that question.

Right,
Let me conclude, Your Honors, by saying

In 1911, tills Court, in Dr. Miles, gave a strong argu­

ment for the public policy reason for th® eventual Schwinn per
S3 rule whan it said a manufacturer
at prices satisfactory

having sold its product

to itself, the public is entitled to

whatever advantage may be derived from competition and

subsequent traffic.

We believe that rule has as much signifi

cance today for the same reason as it did in 1911.
