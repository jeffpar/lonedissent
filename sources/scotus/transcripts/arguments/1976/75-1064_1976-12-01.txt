ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. WATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WATKINS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
With the Court's indulgence, I would like to
initially note that I intend to submit ‘the jurisdictional
issues that I raise? however, I, of course, will answer any
questions fch© Court may have.

That includes the habeas corpus

issue and th® Eleventh Amendment issue.

I intend to devofc©

my entire argument time to th® merits.
This suit ~
QUESTION;

You intend to discuss, th© way you now

have your argument planned, the question of the class that was
before the Court?
MR. WATKINS;

I had not intended to discuss that —

in connection with th® mootness issue?
QUESTION;

No.

What I am interested in is this ,

and if you didn't plan to discuss it, certainly don't feel
obliged to.
As I read th© district court’s opinion, at no time
since th© beginning of this litigation have any of the plain-

4

tiffs in the action been less than 13 years of age.

And, as

I read the district court’s opinion, there are Pennsylvania

regulations which provide far treatment of 13-yearmolds in a
much different manner than, those under 13.
MR. WATKINS;

That’s correct.

However, I believe

that members of ‘the class clearly are under the ag© of 13.
QUESTIONS Well, but can a class —* named plantiffs,
all of whom are over 13, represent a class which includes
people under 13 if, in fact, 'the law treats one differently
teian th© other?
MR. WATKINSs

Well, I think it can in this case,

Your Honor, because the court, when defining th® class, also
noted certain unmentioned individuals, but patient numbers.
I believe some of those in th© record were under the age of
13.
QUESTION: But there was no named individual?
MR. WATKINS;

That’s correct.

That's correct.

This suit was commenced in 1972 whan th© five named
plaintiffs challenged th© admission, their admission to
Haverford State Hospital, which was initiated under sections
402 and 403 of Pennsylvania’s Mental Health Act, and allowed
generally parents to admit their children upon the advice of
a recommending psychiatrist or physician, whichever was
appropriate.
The lawsuit basically challenged, under the due

5
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the authority of
their parents mid their phvsican to commence and effectuate
this admission without the full panoply of due process.
In Pennsylvania, under sections 402 and 403, a
parent may admit his child, provided that medical recommenda­
tions ar© concurrent with that desire.
Shortly after the litigation was commenced, as Mr.
Justice Rehnquistwas alluding to earlier, regulations were
adopted by the defendants which greatly expanded the rights
of children under the Mental Health and Mental Retardation
Act.

Generally those regulations

and they are set out in

full —* provida that a child over 13 is given elaborate
notice and upon objection, either written or oral, may — is
automatically appointed

counsel if he is unable to afford

counsel, and is provided a full adversarial hearing within
which to contest both the parental recommendation and the
medical racoromendation.
The notice which is provided the child and must be
explained to the child is extremely detailed? provides the
name of the physician who is recommending the commitment, and
provides the name of th© applicant, counsel, how to get ahold
of coins©1, and various other procedural protections.
Moreover, in Pennsylvania now, and shortly after th®
lawsuit, an admission of a child may not proceed on the basis
of one medical recommendation alone.

It must be independently

6
concurred in by a second medical recommendation,
Thus, it's understatement to say that in Pennsylvania
there are certain legal impediments for a parent, who is
intent on dumping a child in an institution.
The lower court viewed extensively both the statute
and the regulations, and held that the — that both together
failed to meat constitutional muster.

There was on© judge

dissenting, holding basically that the regulations, when
viewed in the proper context of parent-child relationship
involved in this case, did indeed meet constitutional muster.
For this Court, there are primarily two issues on
fixe merits of this case.
First, does the liberty interest that's involved,
the child’s liberty interest, in the proper context, warrant
further protection under the Constitution of this country?
Is the statutory and regulatory —
QUESTION:

Further in relation to what?

MR. WATKINS s
QUESTION:
MR. WATKINS:

In relation to —
The old procedures or the new ones?
The new procedures and tlx® old pro­

cedures, taken together. The statute an.d the regulation.
I think the record is very clear, Mr. Chief Justice,
that the court and certainly the dissent exhaustively studied
the regulations and considered them si its opinion.
It rejected — as I recall the lower court's opinion.

7
they rejected the regulations primarily because, one, they
did not apply to children tinder 13? and, two, -they did not
provida a time certain when the adversarial hearing would take
place,
QUESTION;

Of course now you have a new statute.

Just last summer.
MR. WATKINS:

There is a new statute that applies

only to the mentally ill.

And, as X have pointed out, that

is approximately 20 percent of th© plaintiff class.
QUESTION:

Th© rest being mentally retarded?

MR. WATKINS;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

And the new statute changes in no way whatsoever th©
relationship of the child-parent and State, who is under 14.
So, for all intents and purposes, a very small portion of the
plaintiff class has been affected by the intervening legis­
lation.
The question is, is this statutory and regulatory
framework deficient?

Ar© parents to be limited in the mental

health area, where they certainly ar© not in th© physical
health area?
Surely, if I, as a parent, seek to admit my child
for a serious physical ailment that may require total
incarceration, an Rh-n@gativ@ problem, or something, where
I have no antibiotic or any ability to ward off diseases,
surely, no on® would contend that a hearing must pr@c©d@ that

e
recommendation =

Yet —

QUESTION:

Weil,, isn’t there a question, Mr. Watkins,

before you get to th© question of what kind of a hearing you
have, as to whether there’s any State action here?
MR. WATKINSs
QUESTION:

Well, I —
Is it the State that's depriving anybody

of any liberty?
MR. WATKINS:
it, <and I agree with you

The question is

I am approaching

is whether or not there is a

liberty interest involved at all here.
The conflict which th® lower court failed to perceive
— and I believe this is what you’re getting to, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist ~~ th© conflict is between th© parent and child,
not between the parent and state.
In effect, there may b© no State action as compared
to th® Gault situation, where you've got a State coming into
the family and taking th® child.
However, it’s clear that the state is treating the
patients and th© plaintiffs pursuant to State law, and the
State is, in fact, holding the plaintiffs.
QUESTION: Well, is it that clear?

What happens if

a child runs away from one of these institutions?

Certainly

they don't issue a bench warrant, do they?
MR. WATKINS:

Well, it's — ther® are no set pro­

cedures, but that’s possible.

First, obviously, the parents

9
would be notified.
In fact — well, it could run the gamut of calling
the police.
QUESTION:

Is there something in th© record about

this?
MR. WATKINS:

I don’t beliav© so, Your Honor.

I

don’t believe so.
QUESTION:

Is that any different from what it would

b® if th© parents report a missing child and the police follow
their procedures and go out and pick th© person up and return
him to th© family?

Is that about what’s don© with the

institutional situation?
MR. WATKINS:

That's correct.

I think it would fo©

-- it would certainly be an ad hoc procedure.

I’m sure that

in some counties, if a child ran away from the general
hospital, th© police

called, the parents are called, the

polio© may wall return the child to th© hospital, ©specially
if th© child is in hospital garb, for instance.
QUESTION:

In Pennsylvania, if th© parents, with

private physicians, take a child within this ag© category to
&

private hospital, private institution, is there State

action?

r
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

To a private institution?

Yes.

MR. WATKINS:

In so far as fee private institutions

10

are regulated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and must
conform their activities — that is, they must abide by the
regulatory scheme that we've established.

For instance, a

private facility, such as the Devereaux School, under
Pennsylvania law, mist provida — abide by the regulations
that were promulgated.
Now, I am not going to stand here and say that that
is the same as line authority. There is a great and vast
difference. But they certainly must conform to Stats law,
and feh© Stats has the power of lifting the license.
QUESTION?

Well, let me — I see, what does that

mean, Devereaux has what?

So many physicians, so many nurses,

some such physical facilities? is that the
MR. WATKINSs

Well, there are certain qualitative

regulations, but primarily I'm concerned with the procedures.
They must follow the procedures that w® establish for admission.
QUESTION:

For admission, I see.

MR. WATKINS:

They must foloow the procedures for

admission.
QUESTION:

Precisely as a public institution?

MR. WATKINS5
QUESTION*

That's correct.

That's correct.

Mr. Watkins# ara all of the institutions

named in this case public institutions?
MR. WATKINS:

No.

Thera are institutions discussed

in the record that are privata institutions.

Ii
QUESTION j But. are they named parties?
MR» WATKINS:

I do not believe they are.

Haver fore

State Hospital is a public institution.
QUESTION:

So th© named parties are public

ins titutions ?
MR» WATKINS:

That’s correct»

That’s correct.

QUESTION: Do you contend that th© issues are any
different with respect to © privat® placement as opposed to a
public placement?

That is, th® nature of the institution.

MR. WATKINS:

With respect to State action or with

respect to the Constitution?
QUESTION;

No, in any respect.

Ar© the issues th©

same if th® child is placed in DeveraauK, as if he’s placed
in a State' hospital?
MR. WATKINS:

I think not.

I think that I must back

up and say that it’s ©ur contention, the Commonwealth contends
that when it is a parental — a joint decision between the
parent and th® doctor, the parent has the authority to admit
anywhere, public or

well, let me correct myself.

The constitutional issues certainly ar© th© sain®.
I would view them the same®
The problem with the lower court’s decision, and fete
fundamental error that it made, was it, in some simplistic
fashion, I think, applied this Court's rationale in Gault to
a situation where Gault clearly did not apply.

12
Gault analysed a conflict between the child* the
parents and the State* which was imposing incarceration upon
the chiId * without notice to the parents* yanking the child*
if you will* from the family scene* into an institution.
There can be nothing that is more close to a criminal

The

And did feh©

Or did the juvenile do it?

That's not at all the issue in a commitment proceeding*
or an admission proceeding.
The critical findings are whether or not this child
is indeed mentally ill* and whether or not* in feh© professional
re commendation of th© physicians* this child needs in-patient
psychiatric or psychological car©,
X fail to see where an intervening hearing is going
to fail-safe that proceeding,
QUESTIONs

Well* why do you give it after th© ag©

of 14?
MR, WATKINSs

That’s a vary good question.

It’s our view that —» and X think th© cases through­
out th© country clearly demonstrate this — that adulte* a
competent adult has th@ right to reject medical treatment* be

QUESTION;
MR, WATKINS;
Health Act, y©s,

And in Pennsylvania is h© adult at 14?
Well, for purposes of th© Mental

Fourteen-year-olds and above are treated

exactly as adults.
QUESTION;

In what, other way is h® treated as an

adult?
MR. WATKINS;

In most other ways.

In most other

ways, —•
QUESTION;
MR. WATKINS;
QUESTION;
MR. WATKINS;

Can he drive a car?
No, h© cannot.

No, h© cannot.

Can he drink liquor?
No, he cannot, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION: Well, I mean, what — I thought adults
could do that.
You just make — you just say for th© purpose of
putting him in an insfcitufcj.on he's an adult.
MR. WATKINS;

That's correct.

That's the — the

Pennsylvania Legislature has decided that, and I think on
sound expert opinion, that the age of 14 is about when an
objection to certain types of treatment would bs reliable.
Th© record, in fact,contains testimony that 13, 14, that ag©
is about when a child can determina his own destiny.
Now, unfortunately, and some, and many do disagree
with tii© Pennsylvania Legislature, those children are not able

14
to drinkf drive,

vote.

But, b© that as it may, in answer to your question,
the determination at an involuntary proceeding, I submit, is
not whether or not — the judge isn’t determining whether or
not this patient needs car©, the judge is determinings Is
this patient able to reject that care?
doing when he rejects that care?

Does h® know what he’s

If he does, that’s his

business,
Certainly no one can fore® m© to have ray broken leg
fixed, if I don’t wish to have it fixed.
That issue doesn’t arise in a juvenile —
QUESTION:

On th© other hand, if you’re dealing with

either mentally ill people or mentally retarded people, even
adults, there's some question about their ability to make
decisions for themselves, isn’t there?
MR. WATKINS:

That’s correct.

Of course, that

creates a presumption problem,
QUESTION:

That’s why courts appoint guardians

ad litem in some of these situations, is it not?
MR, WATKINS:

That’s absolutely correct, Mr,

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Because they think the subject, whether

adult or minor, is not capable of making th© judgments
necessarily alone.
MR. WATKINS:

Absolutely correct.

15
However# in this case# what you've got is the lower
court saying# Wa’re going to presume that parents can’t make
■this decision? we’r© going to presume that a strange lawyer# et
public defender is better able to make this decision? we’r©
going to presume that the advocacy process is better able to
work out what is admittedly and concededly an extremely
difficult family decision.

This is a decision that many

families have t© go through.
The lower court’s order is going to effectively raise
an adversarial barrier that# I subrait# is worthless in terms
©f its goal.

Its goal is admittedly to prevent erroneous

commitments,
However, the record in this case doesn’t show on©
erroneous commitment.

The court pointed to not on®

erroneous coramitmsnt.

The court said that it may occur# and

that patents may act against the bast interests of their
children.
Well# parents may act against the best interest of
their children by sending, them to a military academy. But
that is not necessarily, a basis upon which to impose an
adversarial proceeding that requires parents deciding on
long-term educational plans for the children# to appoint a
lawyer for the child# let’s flush this out in a court of law.
QUESTIONS

Or a choice of a private school as

against a public school# or vie® versa.

16
MR. WATKINS:

Absolutely correct.,

Absolutely correct.

This case differs from what the lower court viewed,
and I’ll conclude with this remark, the lower court applied
Gault in feotoj just slapped the order of Gault right over this
fact situation, totally ignoring the fact that the parents
instituted these proceedings.

The parents decided, ”1 want

my child in an institution'', along with medical recommendations.
The court ignored that, arid viewed it as if the State had
come in and said -to the parents, "Your child will be
admitted”.
QUESTIONS

That’s why you say that the appropriate

remedy is a case-by-case treatment, by way of a habeas corpus
proceeding?
MR. WATKINSs

Absolutely. Absolutely. Pennsylvania

clearly provides that.
QUESTION:

But you can’t generalise about such a

sensitive problem as this, is that your point?
MR. WATKINS:

Not. only can’t you, but you shouldn’t.

The lower court’s decision is totally unwise in its breadth
and scope.
For instance, it lumps mentally retarded and
mentally ill together.

There is a tremendous amount of

question as to whether that was wise.
Thank you very much.
QUESTION: This case was decided under the Fourteenth

17
Am©ndmentj right?
\

MR. WATKINS s
QUESTIONS

Exclusively.

And you just pointed out that it was the

— everything that happened here was at th© behest of the
parents,

I was wondering, where is the State action, because

the Fourteenth Amendment, of course, applies only as against
a State,
MR. WATKINS;

Well, the parents could not have

effectuated the commitment without the concurrence of the State.
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. WATKINS:

In other words, it is the State

facility, and it is the State law pursuant to which the State
Hi© parents ar© acting.
QUESTION:

Well, is a parent's decision to send a

child to a public school a State decision?
MR. WATKINS;
QUESTION;

No. Absolutely not.

However,

Then where is th© State action?

MR. WATKINS;

However, here you've got State

psychiatrists examining the child and recommending fch© care.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Well, they ar© State teachers, presumably,

in a public school.
MR, WATKINS;

Excuse me, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I didn’t —
QUESTION;

In Justice Stewart’s hypothesis of sending

18

a child to a public school, you've got state teachers, or
County teachers.

They may recommend that 'die kid go to that

school. Why is that any different?
MR. WATKINS;

Well, they may, and I assume —

possibly, if that war® a part of the system.

If, before you

could put your child in a public school, let’s say, you had to
go to the school and the school had to say f:W© want your child”,
the "child needs us", that’s a little more State action than
the present system, which is;

I’m living in this district,

I'm going to send my child to that school.
QUESTION;

of course, in th© public school, fch®

child comes home.
MR. WATKINS;
QUESTION;
action?

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Th© question is, where is the State

Did you raise this at all?
MR. WATKINS;

This issue was not raised at th©

trial court level.
QUESTION;

Or ©ver, until «- until I just asked th©

question.
MR. WATKINS s

I believe that I recall, in on© of

tli© ©arly colloquies — I, unfortunately, did not try the
case? but I believe one of the early colloquies between th©
court, there was soma discussion of it.
The resolution, I think, was eminently correct.
You've got State institutions, Sfcafc© psychiatrists recommending

19

th© treatment,,

And in many cases , concede cl ly. strongly

recommended the treatment,.
QUESTIONi Mr* Watkins, before you sit down,, you
started by saying there were -two issues you were going to
talk about, on© was whether there was an impact on liberty,
as I understand it*

I never did understand what th® second

issue was.
MR. WATKINS;

The second issue is, assuming that

there is an impact on liberty, was th® lower court's order
justified?
And, just briefly, there is a checklist which more
fully —
QUESTION:

In other words, was this the proper

procedure and so on,
MR. WATKINS;
QUESTION:

That’s right.

I understand,

MR. WATKINS;

It’s unwise in its breadth, it’s

unsound in its scop©.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G. SEGAL# ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA*
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SEGAL:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it pleas® the

Court:
Th© Supreme Court of Pennsylvania begins the first
year of its third century in an unprecedented role in appearing
in this Court.

It is the first time# and# to that extant#

unique# and perhaps emphasizes the importance.
It appears her© in its administrative role# under
Article 5 of our new Constitution.

I say "new89, it was adopted

in *68# and we're still getting accustomed to some parte of
it# sine© it replaced a Constitution almost a century old.
Under tine Constitution# th© Supreme Court is completely
responsible for and mandate -- and th© Constitution mandates it
to exercise supervisory and administrative authority over all
th© courts of Pennsylvania.
Th© Constitution is quit© specific in listing almost
everything, at least, that I# as the draftsman of that
provision# could think of, that courts do? so teat th© Supreme
Court would become# as indeed it is# the administrator of th©
courts of Pennsylvania.

Under the Constitution it appoints an

Administrator* and has don© so# in th© distinguished former
Justice of our Supreme Court, who sits in this room.
But if the appearance of tea Supreme Court in this

21

Court is unique, ©van more unique is the action of th©
district court in this case.
And X think I*m safe, at least to the extant that
the research c£ xay associates and X go, in saying that there is
no case in which a lower court has conceded that there is no
constitutional mandate upon it to call upon, to command the
State courts to take action, and, nevertheless, did so.
And did so in a drastic and completely absorbing manner.
Th© case proceeded through its entire trial, through
the entire argument, without so much as a mention of the us©
of the courts.

And ©ven whan it first appeared -- in our

briaf we said that it first appeared in th© proposed order of
the plaintiffs.

That isn’t correct; it appeared shortly before

that, as a footnote in the opinion of th© court.
comment by th© court.

Without any

The court just blandly said:

Until

th© Legislature acts, w® command — didn't us© those words ~~
until the Legislature acts, the State court system shall carry
.

on.
They used fell® words "initially" mid "until it
creates an unbiased tribunal".

In th© final order, it says,

"until th© State Legislature creates an alternate neutral
tribunal".
And, indeed, my friend, in his complaint, simply
asks for a disinterested mid impartial decision maker.
And then com©s this footnote, end then comes th©

22
order, as a complete surprise to anyone.

Thera!s this mandate

to the courts, and there * s no mandata to the Legislature?
indeed, if there would have been an incentive on the Legis­
lature to act, if, for example, 'they had followed the
accustomed procedure, assuming they ar© right substantively,
of simply sayings

This is the mandate to the Commonwealth

and unless the Commonwealth acts, then all these people will
be released.
The public clamor would have made the Legislature
act.

Today there can't b© any clamor.

Th© district court,

in its wisdom, has said that this shall b© saddled upon th©
State court system.
Now, it has bean said that — may I ask Your Honors,
after ray friend finished, he was asked questions by -the
Court? I had thought I had ten minutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. SEGAL;

Mi I to ba **—

You will have ten minutes.

Thank you.

Because I really think it’s a vary important matter
to th© Court.
Th© defendants, th© Attorney General, in his
exceptions to that order, mad© clear to th© court his conten­
tion that this was outside th© jurisdiction of th© court.
Now, this Court has said in so many opinions

I

r®£er primarily to Younger v. Harris, where this Court really
pulled together the philosophy, pointed out that comity

23

demands that the federal government would never interfere with.
State court systems unless under constitutional mandate, and
even then with the greatest of reluctance,
Mow, I just quote one sentence, the most important,
"the notion of comity? that is a proper respect for State
functions”

And then the Court later sayss ”And a continuance

of the belief that the National Government will fare best if
th® States and their institutions ar© left free to perforin
their separate functions in their separate ways,*5
Mow, I have said to Your Honors that this is unique.
Why?
Her® is a Court that concedes that there is no
constitutional mandat® that th© courts take this up? indeed,
it sayss

Until the Legislature creates a neutral administra­

tive tribunal.
And, nevertheless, it mandates the courts.

And,I

may say# mandates them in such a way -that if the courts take
up this task, they can do nothing els© for months ahead, as
the telegram from the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania to this
Court specifically said, in describing the overwhelming and
disrupting of th© judicial system of Pennsylvania, as he
described it, which this would cause.
Nevertheless, drastic as it is on th© courts ©f
Pennsylvania, I suggest to Your Honors that it is a more
drastic deviation, a more drastic disregard of th© mandates

24

of this Court, of the preachings of this Court, almost from
its vary beginnings, at least from Chief Justice Marshall
up to this Court, which has, on three different occasions,
mad© clear that there will foa no change in that rule.
New, I might say to Your Honors that there is a very
serious question, whether forgetting the interest of the court;
system of Pennsylvania, the district court didn’t disregard
the interest of the people whom it really intended to help»
Whether th© order wouldn't crests more harm than help for
these youngsters.
I may say, I happen to agree with Mr. Justice
Rehnquisfc, that to talk about 13 and 14-year-olds doesn't
represent th© one and two-year-old any more than a 14-year-old

is ’’Can you drive?”

Whan you can drive at 16.

Or an 18-

year-old child who can vote represents a 14-year-old child
v?ho can’t vote.

And so on.

In States where IS has become

th® voting age.
Now, my view is supported, and I believe this from
the beginning, when we got the brief of th© most distinguished
people in America on the subject, th® American Psychiatric
Association, th® Amari can Society' for Adolescent Psychiatry,
fchs American Academy of Child Psychiatry, the Amari can
Association of Psychiatric Services for Children, all of them
have said that this kind of adversary proceeding, far• from

25
providing the ideal forum for such determination, has a very
great potential for ham to many individuals.

Particularly

the younger indixd.duals.
QUESTION:

Is the judge given, the State judge

under tills mandate given any discretion about not requiring the
child to be present?
MR. SEGAL:

No, there's nothing said about that.

QUESTION;

He’s mandated to have the subject of

th® proceeding present in the courtroom?
MR. SEGAL;

Yes.

Now, there is a waiver of some

provisions permitted, provided that counsel joins in it, but
h© must first get counsel.

And these experts say, Your

Honors, that an administrative model for a tribunal that
reviews such matters may be the most effective, and it happens
th® American Psychiatric Association suggests a psychiatrist,
a lawyer, and another mental health professional.
The Solicitor General of the United States has filed
an amicus, in which he takes the same position, and suggests
an independent board of psychiatrists or other professionals.
But I submit to Your Honors, and I don’t draw on my
own experience which, in this field, has been rather consider­
able with institutions, that I don’t think you can find an
honest disagreement on the part of th© profession, or at
least the group people in th© profession.
Mow, Your Honors, there are some points mad© by the

26

defendants, I believe they ®r© answered? but w© didn’t seek
to bscoins a party,, it seems to in© crystal-clear that

my stopwatch — the — and I think your lights are out of
kilter, Mr. Chief Justice»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR, SEGAL;

Th®v s©@m to be.

‘Hi® ~ first they argue that the Supreme

Court didn’t ask to be a party.

Well, for Heaven’s sake, why

would they ask to bs a party, when the plaintiff in its
complaint asked for an administrative tribunal, when the court
never so much as m©ntioned the — the district court — that
the courts would b© involved, until the opinion came down?
Wien th© opinion cam© down, nothing happened until three
months later.

There was communication with — almost three

0

months — with th© Administrator’s office.
t

Second, they say that the court never really had a
chance to rule on this question.

Well, that’s not correct.

Of course, because, as I said, the defendants* exception
specifically raised it.
And, finally, they take the wholly unwarranted
position

now’ I quote -- "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court

indicated it would provide the hearings contemplated in th©
proposed order.”
What actually happened is, a legal assistant in the
Administrator’s office wrote a letter, in which he said the

27
courts would cooperate and provida for Special Masters.
W© 11# it so happens# first of all# that Special
Masters would be invalid under the Constitution of
Pennsylvania# if they were given decisional authority? and#
second, when it cam© to the Supreme Court# they just dismissed
it out of hand.

And when you couldn't hav© Special Masters#

the Administrator had a commitment from Judge Hewitt# that
Judge Hewitt would call him and would discuss these matters
with him.
Instead of that# Judge Hewitt called him on© day
end said# "My order is being entered today.

I'm sorry# but

I've got to enter it# so that the people can appeal, and I’m
sending you my order.”

And the Administrator wrote to him#

saying# "In view of that# we simply can’t handle it in the
courts of Pennsylvania.”
And that’s the whole story, Your Honors.
I suggest that th® district court acted without
precedent# it acted unwisely# it acted unnecessarily.

Its

own opinion shows fcM; an administrative tribunal would have
done “« and if I were the judge# what I would simply have
said iss

up to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to provide- the hearings?

I submit to Your Honors that# at

respect, th© order must be reversed.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Ferleger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERLEGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FERLEGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
The general issue in this case of whether the State
may, upon parental application, institutionalize involuntarily
and indeterminately juveniles in mental institutions is a
vary great one. And I think that the importance in implications
of any ruling in this matter demand that the Court foe aware of
what is not before it* and how narrow the issues in this case
actually are.
This case does not involve the issue of whether
private facilities, which are truly private, even if they are
mental health facilities, must have hearings before a child
is committed.
Pennsylvania law, cited at page 5, footnote 1, of
my opinion, makes it clear that under Pennsylvania law private
facilities are required to us© the provisions of the statutes
that are involved here.
This case is unlike the Jackson vs. Metropolitan
Electric case, where all you had was a general State regulation
and no action by the State regarding requirements for hearings
before electricity terminations.
This case does also not. involve the standard of

30

commitment, whether you have to b© dangarous or merely
mentally ill to be committed.

The Court made that very clear

at footnote 4 of its opinion.
The case does not involve the self“incrimination
issue.

Can a potential mental patient be forced to testify

against him or herself?
QUESTION:
second.

Mr. Ferleger, let me just interrupt a

You say it does not involve th© privet© placement

question.

But if, as you say, they ara required by State lev

to follow the procedure which you say is inadequate, would
they not be acting under color of State law in accepting a
child?
MR. FERLEGER:
QUESTION?

Wall, y©S, —

Therefor®, are w© not necessarily

if w© decide it on® way or th® other, necessarily deciding the
privata question as w©ll?
MR. FERLEGER:

With regard to Pennsylvania as —

well, I do agree that priv&t© facilities in Pennsylvania are
acting under color of State law.

There are other States,

though, *—
QUESTION: So we ®r® deciding that question in
Pennsylvania in this case?
MR. FERLEGER:

That’s correct.

These ar® other

States, however, in which private institutions function just
as any mental hospital

any general hospital that is public *•-

31

that' s private.
So that in some States private institutions,, an
affirmance in this cas® wouldnot affect those States at all.
QUESTION:

Whan you say you agree that they ar®

acting under color of State law, actually

you contend that

they ar© acting undor color of State law, don’t you?

I mean,

you wanted them embraced in the deer©© —
MR* FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

-«• and the district court did,

MR, FERLEGER:

Your Honor, th$ facilities that are

covered by the Pennsylvania Mental Health statute, the word
’’facility” itself is defined in the Act as including private
as well as public facilities.

No person can enter any

hospital, mental hospital in Pennsylvania except under the
statutes that are challenged in this case.
QUESTION:

And you contend that makes the action of

the private facilities, when they follow the State law,
State action?
MR, FERLGERe
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, I misunderstood.

I thought your

point simply was that as a matter of State law Pennsylvania
requires that private facilities provide the same procedural
procedures as do public facilities? and, therefore, any
decision in this case respecting public facilities would, as
a matter of State law, affect the private facilities in

32

Pennsylvania,

It’s not Ilk© ~ it’s not a matter of acting

under color of State lav, they are just simply bound by State
law to behave th© same way? isn’t that it?
MR. FERLEGER*

Mr. Justice Stewart* 1 would agr©©.

I think that both are alternative grounds that end up with
that sara© result.
QUESTION;

But the only way a private organization

can hold a person against his will is by virtu® of State
authority,
MR. FERIEGER;
QUESTION s

That’s correct.

You cannot get out.

MRo FERLEGERs

That’s correct.

QUESTION5

You’re restrained by virtu® of State law,

QUESTION;

Not merely a requirement, but it’s a

protection for -the private institution from a suit for false
imprisonment or something like that.
MR. PERL GSR:

Y©S.

Another issue that I submit is not involved in this
case is whether a judicial hearing, as opposed to administra­
tive hearing, is required.

Th® lower court, contrary to Mr.

Segal’s suggestion, never readied that issue.

The complaint

which was filed four years ago, before th© blossoming of
mental health cases in th© .lower courts, did not request a
judicial hearing, and th© entire issue which is, in part, an
equal protection issu©, of whether a judicial hearing is

33

required as opposed to an administrative hearing was not
specifically decided by the lower court.
Another issu® that is not —
QUESTION:
Legislature acts.

Well, again, it is decided until the
Paragraph 11 of the order says they’ve

got to use the State court system,
MR, PE RLE GSR;

That’s correct.

But that result,

Mr. Justice Stevens, and it was discussed in the earlier
argument, is one that was inevitable by the declaratory
judgment that the lower court entered.
One© th© declaratory judgment entered, the children
could not b© placed upon parental application. The only way
that a child could get into a mental hospital involuntarily,
except in an emergency, would be through a court action.
Th© State courts, through the declaratory judgment, would have
keen holding all these hearings for new commitments, in any
cas@.

Thar© was no additional burden that was placed upon th©

State courts once the declaratory judgment entered, and parents
could not longer apply and have th© State accept their
children, the State courts would have been holding all these
hearings for children in any case? and under Pennsylvania law,
children would have had notice *»~
QUESTION:

Well, the Legislature might provide a

different hearing schema.
MR, FERLEGERs

That’s correct.

That's correct

34
QUESTION;

Or could there be a hearing scheme in

—* just without legislation?
MRo PERLEGER:

Beside the courts?

There could not have been a hearing

scheme, in my opinion, without legislation*
QUESTION:

You mean, a mental health facility in

Pennsylvania couldn't, itself, in responding to a judgment of
a district court, institute an administrative hearing, oa its
own, that would satisfy due process?
f4R„ PERLEGER:

That would satisfy the opinion in

tills case?
QUESTION:

Yes, except for the paragraph that —

except for the order that you hold it in the courts,
MR, PERLEGER:

In my opinion, not, because with the

declaratory judgment, the only provisions left for admission
to mental hospitals were those under the statute and the
regulations, and the Pennsylvania law is clear that otherwise
any mental facility cannot admit anyone,
QUESTION:

Well, that would have met with your

original prayer, though,
MR, PERLEGER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

With your original prayer, that's all

you eskad for,
MR, FERLEGERs

That's correct. But that .issue is

not presented by th© briefs, or the facts in this case,
QUESTION:

You agree with the State of Pennsylvania

35

that Referees could not b© appointed by the State courts to
perform the function mandated by their federal court?
MR. FERLEGER:

The State courts could certainly

appoint Masters or Referees to hold hearings. As a matter of
fact, in Pennsylvania, under section 406, the court commitment
law section of this Act, in 1971, after Dixon vs. Attorney
General, it's a Pennsylvania mental health decision, th©
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania promulgated a specific rule
allowing Comraon Pleas Courts, trial courts in Pennsylvania,
to appoint Masters to hold mental health hearings.
When Dixon declared physici an™ certification commit­
ment provision unconstitutional, there were 14,000 people in
Pennsylvania mental hospitals who needed hearings, and who
had to get reprocessed.
In this case there ar© about eight or nine thousand
presently committed children who need hearings.
QUESTION:

Must they b© reprocessed even if they

don’t want to b© reprocessed?
MR. FERLEGER:

No.

Your Honor, I wanted to reply

to that, and to the question you asked Mr. Segal about presence
of the person.
The lower court is very clear in its opinion, and
repeats a number of times, that they do not expect a hearing,
a full hearing to take place every time a child is committed.
The lower court is very clear that the only things that cannot

36

be waived are notice and counsel.
However, a hearing can be waived, the right to crossexamine can be waived, the presence of person can either b©
waived by the child, if the child knows what h® or sh© is
doing, or the court can say —* and it is mentioned specifically
in 'the decision — that th© child is too ill to attend the
proceedings.
The children do not have to be taken to each of these
hearings.
QUESTION;

Well, th© idea tiiat anything can b©

waived is certainly nothing that this district court had to
say, that’s just generally accepted law, isn’t it?
MR. FERLEGER:

The generally accepted law, as I

understand th® law, is that in criminal cases, with fch©
exception of an unruly, disruptive —
QUESTION:

So long as it’s knowing and expressed,

you can waive anything, can’t you?
MR. FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

How does a mentally ill 15-year-old child

consummate a valid waiver?

You said fell© lawyer can waive for

that child?
MR. FERLEGER:

I’ll ©xplain.

According to th© lower

court's opinion# th® procedure for waiver is this:

If th©

court finds# or the unbiased tribunal finds# that the child is
competent to make the waiver# with counsel there, then th©

37

child can male© fch© decision.
However, if the court, finds that the child is not
able to make the decision, the counsel that's been appointed
by fell® court is permitted to make the waiver.
QOESTIOMs

That might be quit© a substantial hearing

process, to male® just that preliminary determination, might
it not?
MR. FERLEGERs
QUESTIONs

It could in som©

Psychiatric testimony?

MR. FERLEGERs

It could in som® cases, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION;

Testimony of the parents.

MR. FERLGER;

But those questions are present, Mr.

Chief Justice, when an adult is committed, when a 35-year-old
severely retarded person is committed, when a husband attempts
to commit a wife? those questions of competency to waive
counsel or waive other procedural protections are all present
in any mental hearing.
QUESTION; Well, d© not the psychiatrists indicate
that there may be a difference between th© traumatic impact
on young children, as against other mentally ill or emotionally
disturbed people?
MR. FERLEGERs

I believe that toe record indicates

very strongly otherwise, and the briefs of fche American
0 r fch op s y ch i atne Association, the American Psychological

38
Association, 1 think also indicate otherwise,
Th® experience in this kind of process —
QUESTION:

By ’’otherwise", do yon mean that

there is no traumatic impact —
MRo FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

Mo, what I mean is --

— on a 15-year^old child, to go through

a hearing process?
MRa PERLEGER;

What I mean is that th© trauma is no

greater than that on anyone who goes through mental commitment,
process, and what I mean is that whatever trauma there is,
the trauma is lass than being placed indeterminately in a
mental institution, with n© process at all,
QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

hr® you

defending th© full rang© of procedural due process prescribed
by th© district court?
MR, PERLEGER:

At this point, Mr. Justice Powell,

and I was about to get 'to that ~~ I am not, because I
don’t believe that that question is before this Court.
The appellants, in their brief, did not discuss at
all whether each and ©very on© of the requirements the lower
court required are, in their view, proper.

The lower court’s

decision on whether parents have that power to commit kids
without a hearing,
QUESTION:

If that is not before us, what do you

perceive to b© the central issue?

39

MR» FERLEGER:

The central issue is whether some

kind of hearing, hearing and counsel and notice, those very
basic requirements, whether that is necessary before & child
can b® committed.

Whether it's 72 hours or 48 hours or two

vr@ek3 or a month, that is not before th© Court.

Whether the

specifics of the waiver issue, that is not before the Court.
All those issues are not before the Court at this time.
QUESTION:

Is paragraph 11 before us, Mr, Farleger?

MR. FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

EXCUS© me?

Paragraph 11, "Until th© legislature

establishes ... and orders an alternate neutral tribunal ...
declared that the present facilities of th© Commonwealth court
system be used ...”

Is that before us?

MR, FERLEGER:

Mr. Justice Brennan, I don't believe

it is, for a reason that I’ll explain.
At page 8a in th® appendix to my brief, the letter

40

MRo PERLEGERi

At page 8a afc the Appendix is th©

letter that Mr, Segal referred to as being from an
administrative assistant.
This is part of a correspondence between the district
court and th© State Court Administrator.

There was every

attempt to fo© cooperative, and you*11 note that the date of
this letter, which begins at page 5a, is October 15th, a month
anti two days before the final order was entered.
And at page 8a, the Court Administrator told the
three»judge federal court:

"We are aware that perhaps five

thousand hearings or more may have to be conducted within the
next several months, and are preparing to shoulder that
hearing responsibility with full cooperation to your Honorable
Court."
On psg© 10a, the federal court responded, and in the
third paragraph said:

"I note that you state in your letter

you are preparing to implement our opinion."
How, the order -- and that paragraph that you
referred to, Mr. Justice Brennan, was entered, with no inter»
viming communication from the Pennsylvania courts.

Pennsylvania

courts had told fch© federal court —*
QUESTION:

MR. FERLEGER:

entered, th© objections came, in a letter that’s reproduced

Brennan and Powell, yet you’re asking the Court to affirm the

MR* FERLEGERs

W© are asking ill© Court to affirm

th© judgment across the board, with the caveat that the
Court is not deciding the very detailed specifics of due
process.
I think that this Court can say that the due
process •—
QUESTION: Well, how can w© affirm the judgment of
the district court, which contains detailed specifics of due
process, without deciding that those are required by the
Constitution?
MR. FERLEGER:

Well, X think th© reason is that

tsi© jurisdictional statement and th© issue raised by the
appellante in tills cas© was not whether all those specifics
apply, but whether the parent-Stafee-child relationship allows
a commitment without any kind of hearing at all.

QUESTION:

The first question is whether parents

That’s right,

But isn’t it necessary, in answering that

question, to decide what the constitutional rights of juveniles

MR, PERLEGERs

Yes, but I think it is not necessary

-"-maybe this will clarify it — to go further than saying that;
& juvenile is entitled to some kind of hearing, and not --

I don’t think it’s necessary to go into everything that tee
hearing involves.
QUESTION: Well, then, I don’t see how you can affinr.

MR. PERLEGERs

Well, one alternative would b© to

QUESTION;

But fch© district court had no business

imposing its standards on the State of Pennsylvania, unless
they were mandated by the Constitution.

It isn’t just a

question of discretion or reasonable choice.
MR. FERLEGER; Well, our position is, of course,
that those are mandated by the Constitution.

What I was

explaining is —QUESTION;
affirmed -the judgment.

And w© would have to so hold, if we
Would w® not?

44

MR. FERLEGER:

I am not certain of that.

I think

that the Court can maks it clear that, as in Jackson vs.
Indiana, where the Court said that you can't commit the deafmute , retarded person for some indeterminate term until he
becomes competent? the Court specifically said that no
spacific 'bima requirements would be imposed.
QUESTION: But there we

were reversing a judgment

that said there were no requirements.

That's different ‘than

affirming a judgment which says there are a number of require­
ments .
MR. FERLEGER:

MR. FERLEGERs
QUESTION?

Yes.

But that was an issue —

But we can’t review it?

MR. FERLEGERs

That was an issue not decided by the

lower court# because the lower court# at the time that that
provision was entered# understood that the state courts were
going to hold the hearings.

And there was no issue or

controversy about -that.
QUESTION:

Well# why didn't they say that?

They didn’t say that.
MR, FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

That's not in the opinion.

That’s right.

QUESTION:

And it's not before us,

If w© affirm this judgment# the State

of Pennsylvania must do everything that is stipulated in the
judgment# and the only way that I see of avoiding that would
b© to affirm it in part and strike down parts of it.

Do

you disagree with that?
MR, FERLEGERs

I think that the Court could strike

down or at least vacate for reconsideration certain parts of
it# certainly.
QUESTION: But if the judgment below is attacked only-

on on© or two points# this Court has no authority to vacat®

46

any other parte of th© judgment, 1 don’t suppos©»

I mean,

w©’r© entitled to adjudicate only th® questions that are
raised here, aren't w®?
MR» FERLEGER;

I think that th© question with regard

to th® commitment issue that

procedures of commitment, the

question raised by tee jurisdictional statement is whether
parents can giv© up children's rights; and in this cos© what
we are asking for is what this Court has upheld in mental
health cases since 1917, and what every court has upheld that
has considered it, which i© the basic right to a chance to tell
your side of th® story before you’r© put into a mental
hospital»
And it’s our position that th© rights that the State
grants parents to apply for iistitufcionalization, and it’s
always th© State facility that melees the decision about
institutionalisation, th© parents cannot put any child into
an institution unless th© facility says they will accept the
child; those rights cannot ha upheld where a child is
incarcerated for an indeterminate time, in the situation which
is potentially vary dangerous, and where there is great
stigma and effect, adverse effect, on the child»
That involuntary, indeterminate kind of institution”
alization, we feel brings this case within the Gault line of
cases, as well as th® mental health cases that this Court has
decided»

And we feel, further, that parents cannot b© granted

/

4?

th© absoluta right to make that decision.
As in th© San forth case, w® submit that the rights
of th© parents, whatever those constitutional righto may be,
cannot be such as to deprive toe child of liberty in that kind
©£ way. Those parents! rights, whatever they may be, do not
outweigh th© child’s right to counsel and a chance to toll
his or her side of to© story.
QUESTION; Mr. Ferleger, would you address the
argument tost on® of th© briefs makes, that the procedures
that ar© specified will create an additional stigma to th®
institutionalisation that does not now necessarily exist? and
they ar©, to that extent, counterproductive?
MR. FERLEGER;

Y©s.

On© of our expert

witnesses,

Mr. Justice Stevens, said that ha has never seen that having
an attorney or a hearing adds to th® stigma.

What it stigma-

tizes, h© said, is the fact of being a mental patient, the
fact of being in a hospital.
There is, because of th© admissions process, a

QUESTION s

Did that expert say anything about the

trauma of a 14-year-old —
MR. FERLEGER: Y®S.
QUESTION:

— or a 13-year-old going through

contested hearing of this kind?
MRa FERLEGER:

Yea.

Th© opinion of the experts

was that, in fact? as the Court noted in Gault, the trauma —
excuse me, the hearing process can be vary therapeutic? to
whatever extent it is traumatic, it is no more traumatic than
it is for adulte who have the hearing, and whatever trauma
there is is insignificant compared to -fell© trauma of being
locked up in a hospital with no chanc© to have some fair
procedure to determine that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferleger, assuming we reach tee

issue of what process is due, what do you think of th®
suggestion that an independent board of psychiatrists would
fca appropriate to make the independent decision which you
suggest is necessary?
MR. FERLEGER:

I think that an independent tribunal

of some sort — it’s my own personal opinion *— might ba
appropriate and might withstand constitutional scrutiny if
I

this Court should ever be faced with that issue.
I am not certain whether I agree that th© board
should be composed simply of psychiatrists.

The courts! have

mad® it very clear that a deprivation of liberty in th© mental

49

health area is not a medical decision, and is not the kind of
thing that should b© left simply to the medical profession,
QUESTION:

You ar© not insisting on a judicial

decision maker, are you?
MR, FERLEGER:

My own feeling is that the

Constitution, if it was ever presented, ought to require and
would require such a hearing.
QUESTION:

But I am not —

Would or would not?

Did you say

would or would not?
MR. FERLEGERs

Would.

But I am not aware of any

decision that has faced that question. Every other mental
health decision in the country, in the federal courts as well
es the State courts, requires a judicial hearing. There is
th©

Seville vs. Treadway case

in Tennessee, which, in some

cases, allows an administrative process, following, I think,
by appeal to a court.

Judge Gibbons, one of the members of the panel in
on® hearing in this cas®, raised as a possibility a tribunal
that was administrative, followed by court appeal.
QUESTION: What’s the authority of the United States
Circuit or a district judge to get into that kind of
specificity, as distinguished from saying the procedure you
have is bad because it violates th© Constitution?
MR. FERLEGER:

Yes.

th© power to specify soma —-

I think that th© courts have

MR, FERLEGER:

can say — and there ar© soma extreme ranges , of course *—
can say that one year in a mental hospital without a hearing

QUESTIONS

Not at all®

federal court might observe that that’s the system of
federalism, but they have no authority to tell them to
experiment, have they?
MR® FERLEGERs
QUESTIONs

Certainly not, Mr® Chief Justice®

May I ask you two questions before you

sit down?
First, would you comment briefly on the argument that
imposing the attorney requirement, particularly in th® private
sector, adds a significant element of cost, and th® whole

52
business is so expense already that it may actually deter the
number of children who need care who will actually be placed.
And, secondly, would you comment on the suggestion
that th® proper disposition now is to remand for consideration,
in light of th® new statute?
MR. FERLEGERx

Certainly, Mr. Justice Stevens.

Th© final prehearing order in this case contains
tables regarding th© number of peopl© committed to hospitals.
Th® pages are a little obscure, but at 314 through 316 of
th© Appendix, indicates that th© numbers of people committed
each year to State institutions, which are those that are
listed her®, ar© not all that great on a yearly basis,
Th© number of people now in hospitals is very large.
But th© number of people who come in is not so great, in

my

opinion, that th© cost of providing counsel or a hearing
provides too great an administrative burden,
QUESTION:

I!m not talking only about -she cost in

the public facilities, but th© private as well. Do those
figures relate to that?

That's really probably not part of

th© record, is it?
MR, FERLEGER:

Those figures don't discuss th©

number of people that came in, into th® private facilities,
QUESTION:

On® of the arguments was that this

inevitably th® private placements will be governed by this,
and tli© easts of the private placement will b© affected by th©

That's correct.

that th©

parents would b© required to pay for the child's needs? wouldn't
h©?

Wouldn't the father and mother?
MR, FERLEGER;

I do not believe that that is

expressed at all in Pennsylvania law. Also? Pennsylvania law
specifically states that people in commitment proceedings

shall be represented by public defenders? without specifying
child or adult? and without defining the standards for
indigency,
QUESTION;

Public defenders generally are only

available to th© indigent? aren't they?
MR. FERLEGER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Do you notaae any risk at all that an

overdose of due process might b® just, as dangerous as an
overdose of insulin shock treatment on a mental patient?
MR. FERLEGER:

Not when the due process involves

procedures that go to th© very essence of the fact-finding
procedure,

QUESTION? The question is: What is your reaction to

MR. FERLEGERs

Yes.

I don't believe ‘that the new

before the Court is the
Act of 19S6.

class that is still in mental hospitals as of today ar©

This is unlike th©

way the new statute# because the members of th© class whom I

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. WATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WATKINSs
QUESTION:

Thank you? Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Watkins? may I just ask:

the

questions presented in your Jurisdictional Statement at page
S don't seam to be the s&m© questions presented in your brief
at page 16.
MR. WATKINS:

That's correct? Mr. Justice Brennan.

However? I believe that th© question covered? stated in the
Jurisdictional Statement are sufficiently broad to cover the
statements as they are framed in the brief on the merits.
QUESTION:

You mean all three id the Jurisdictional

Statement ara suborned in the two at page 16 of your brief?
MR. WATKINS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice — or Mr.

Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

I must say? I have a little trouble

reading them that way.
QUESTION: Also? as I read your brief? you. do not
attack fcha prospective — assuming that some hearing is
necessary? assuming that he Pennsylvania procedures do not
satisfy due process? I don’t se© anything in your brief that
really attacks individually — the prospective relief.
MR. WATKINS:

I did not go to each of the elements

in the order.

You don’t say that th© Court misread

due process.
MR. WATKINS:

Not with respect to th© retroactive

application.
QUESTION:

I mean th© individual, the individual

— or prospectiva, th© prospective relief.
MR. WATKINS:

Yes.

It’s our contention, I think the

brief makes -this entirely clear, that the present system in
Pennsylvania meats th© requirements.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. WATKINS:

Therefore, I would — as a necessary

corollary to that position, anything over and above that
must b© erroneous.
QUESTION: Every item is erroneous.

MR. WATKINS;

Anything c-var and above that is

60

/

erroneous^ as a matter of constitutional law,
I would like to address th® question of reasons for
placamento

This has been discussed in the briefs, and I

discussed it. a little more pointedly in my Reply Brief.
There is no doubt that the administrators of these institu­
tions , unfortunately for the litigators , filed documents which
said "reasons for placement"/ and then had a cursory statement#
truancy, or what-have~you.
But what the district court ignored, and what the
plaintiff didn’t bring to your attention just now is that
in the most complete part of the record there are also
medical diagnoses of the

patients.

Those were ignored in the

opinion.
These diagnoses, and I don't purport to be able to
analyse them, I think are clearly relevant to whether or not
the child needed the care that was ultimately ordered.
And 1 would just urge that the record most completely is
reflected in the ten patient summaries, where you have, not
only the quote "reason for placement”, which is, for example,
if I have s stomach-ache, and go to the doctor and the doctor
ultimately ends up removing my gall bladder, obviously it's
)

going to show in my admission note that I came in for a
s tomach-ache.
But it's not fair to conclude that surgery was
performed on me for a stomach-ache.

It was performed on me

61

because I had an infected,, or what-*have«-you, gsll bladder.
Which would show up in. the medical records.
Secondly, I agree with the Chief Justice, that an
overdose of due process can ha very dangerous, in fact it's
lethal to on® very valuable program in Pennsylvania, that's
th© program of respite care.

This order entirely forecloses

that program.
QUESTION*

Program of whet?

MR. WATKINS:

Respite care.

QUESTION: Respite, yes.
MR. WATKINS:

And that allows a parent of a

severely retarded juvenile to place his clind in an institution
for, say, four or fiv® weeks a year, to allow th© parent the
necessary respite to go on.

The ironic effect of this is

going to possibly b© total commitment of that juvenile,
rather than the partial commitmanfc that had heretofore been
th© ease.
I would also like to address th© point that
Pennsylvania, the present rules in Pennsylvania allow for a
Master.

It's quit® fcru© that they do allow for a Master,

but that Master, as I understand the rule, would h&va no
decisional authority? and therefor®, under this Court's
order, a judge would have to h© involved.
