ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT V» JOHNSON» II, ESQ0
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I appear on behalf of the Chief of Police of
Lebanon, New Hampshire, the .Director of the New Hampshire State
Police and the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of
Motor Vehicles, all three of whom are the Appellants herein»
v.

This case presents to this Court two general issues,
the first dealing with symbolic speech, the issue being whether
consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the State
of New Hampshire may prohibit by criminal sanction the knowing
obscuration of the State motto, "Life free or die," on the
license plates of registrants of motor vehicles in NeiM Hampshire»
The second issue is whether or not the Appellees
herein, prior to the utilization of the United States District
Court for the District of New Hampshire, were obligated or
should have exhausted their State appellate remedies»
In 1809, General John Stark of New Hampshire wrote
a letter to his Vermont comrades declining, for reasons of
health, to attend the thirty-second reunion of the 1777 Battle of

4

Bennington* Vermont* in which General Stark had commanded the
Continental troops in the decisive victory against the British
and Germans,
At the conclusion of his letter* General Stark wrote
to his comrades a proposed toast for the reunion.
toast was* and I quote* "Live free or die.

The proposed

Death is not the

worst of evilsp" end quote.
The toast* obviously* was reminiscent of the words of
Patrick Henry back in 1775* "But as for me* give me liberty or
give me death,"
One hundred and sixty-eight years after the battle
of Bennington* Vermont, the New Hampshire General .Court or
Legislature adopted the words* "Live free or die*" as part of
our official* or as the official State motto of the State of
New Hampshire,
QUESTION:

A hundred and what?

MR, JOHNSON:

A hundred and sixty-eight years after

those words were said.
In 19'o9* our Legislature directed the Director of the
Division of Motor Vehicles to place on all passenger vehicles*
registered in New Hampshire, the State motto* "Live free or
die,"
QUESTION:

If you had kept it just "scenic

New Hampshire" you would have avoided this litigation,
wouldn't you?

5
\

(laughter)
MR» JOHNSON;

I am not so sure, Justice Rehnquisfc»

Those purists — those environmental purists may be sitting here
on my right saying that since New Hampshire is no longer pure
we are evading their First'Amendment rights,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You might also have some

copyright problems with Patrick Henry and Virginia on
plagiarism — his concept,
(laughter)
QUESTION:

General Johnson, why did it take the

General Court one hundred and sixty-some years to arrive at
this conclusion?

Usually, they are more traditional

than that

in New Hampshire, aren't they?
*

/

(laughter)
MR, JOHNSON:

We adopted, in New Hampshire, a State

song, a State seal, a State flower and a State tree, as well as
a State motto, in accordance with the format of most States»
While New Hampshire was one of the original signatories
of the Declaration of Independence, I don't know the reason for
the delay in the adoption of the State symbols, but I think that
they were adopted at a simultaneous period of time with the
adoption by other States of State symbols»
Whether our conservative nature had anything to do with
it or not, I don't know»
QUESTION:

Does your case depend upon this having

6

been declared the motto of the State* officially* toy the
Legislature?
MR. JOHNSON:

I think* Mr. Chief Justice, that it

does have some toearing because* by the Legislature's having so
declared this to be the official State motto* the Legislature
has* in ejffect* said that the motto is of importance to the
State of New Hampshire,
Which brings me to the interests of the State of New
Hampshire in having the motto on its plates* on its license
plates.

The motto not only symbolizes the heritage of New

Hampshire, it fosters'an appreciation —
QUESTION:

May I interrupt* Mr, Johnson* before you

get to the State interests.
Do you challenge the District Court's finding that
the Appellees' motivation was based on a fundamental religious
belief?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Yes* Mr, Justice,

You challenge that as clearly erroneous

and ask us to set it aside* do you?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Yes* Mr, Justice.

Do you argue that in your brief?

MR, JOHNSON:

We* in our brief* questioned the

sincerity of the Appellees and you will find*in the transcript
of the hearing* evidence that Mr, Maynard* while he purports
to be a Jehcva's Witness* has been disfellowshioped from the

7

Jehova's Witnesses and* in fact* one of the Jehova's Witnesses
churches had* at one time* one or more criminal prosecutions
against him.
So. a* we question Mr„ Maynard ,;s sincerity and
QUESTION:

Well* on his sincerity* he went to jail*

didn 't he?
. MRa JOHNSON;
QUESTION:

That is correct„

Well* do usually non~sincere people —

they go up to the closing of the door* but they usually change*
don't they?

MRo JOHNSON; 'Well* the matter of sincerity., I think*
is two-barrelled.

The first is the question which a moment age

was placed to me.

We have some doubts as to his sincerity* but

even accepting his sincerity* we then get to the next issue
which is* was what he communicated a particularized statement*
capable of being understood as this Court held it must be in
Spence v, Washington?
QUESTION:

That's a different question,

QUESTION:

I just want to be sure you disagree and

there is evidence* which you point out* that may cast doubt on
the -District Court's finding.

But is there not some evidence

in the record which would require us to accept the finding as
being clearly erroneous?

Didn't he testify that there was a

religious belief* and so forth?
District Court's findings?

Or can we go behind the

8

MRo JOHNSON:

There is evidence both ways.*

The State

«• w

QUESTION:

Well, If you concede that, don't we have

to accept the finding?
MR, JOHNSON:

I do not concede the matter of

sincerity,
In Spence v* ~~ Well, again. I think the two questions
are intertwined.

The sincerity of Mr, Maynard, at the time he

undertook this act — I think there is evidenceibofch ways, as to
leather or not he was undertaking this act on a religious,
conscientious basis or whether it was a mere act of whimsy or
bizarre activity,
QUESTION:
his questions:

I think there is evidence both ways,
As Justice Marshall suggested In one of

Do people ordinarily go along and spend five

days at a time in jail just to pamper a whimsy?

That is some

evidence of sincere belief, however misguided one might think
it is.
Do you rest on the 3?act that he is departed from the
particular faith, that he is a dissident, as undermining his
sincerity?
MR, JOHNSON:

No, I don't believe and 2 don't want to

make this particular issue greater than it is necessary to the
Appellant's case.
While we question the sincerity of Mr, Maynard, I
would submit that his sincerity is not going to resolve the

9

issues before this Court»
VJhile I say that there is evidence both ways,
assuming arguendo the sincerity of Mr» Maynard, I would then
argue that his conduct is not., in fact, symbolic speech»
QUESTION:

-Co you think the State of New Hampshire

could require citizens to carry signs, picket signs, "Support
the United Nations," in a sincere belief by the Legislature
of the State that it was very important to support the efforts
and work of the United Nations?
MR, JOHNSON:
variety of reasons»

My answer to that is no, and for a

The first is that your hypothetical is a

more poignant message, in my mind, than the motto, "Live free
or die,"
Secondly, the motto, "Live free or die," and its
requirement that it be placed upon motor vehicle license plates
has to do with the registration of motor vehicles, the use of
the highways,' an efficient registration system of motor
vehicles and other recognizable interests of the State of New
Hampshire which, I think, are more important than those that
I could enunciate to support your question, Mr, Chief Justice»
QUESTION:

Couldn't the State, just as well, offer

its citizens, its automobile ovmers, an option that if they
did not want that motto on the license, it could be omitted?
MR, JOHNSON:

This matter was raised at the District

Court and the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles

10

testified, in effect, that it would raise has/oe with the
printing of the motor vehicle registration plates, which is one
of the —
QUESTION:

Where are these plates made?

In the

State prisons, arenffc they?
MR* JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr, Justice»

Kind of an irony, Isn5t it?

(laughter)
MRa JOHNSON:

It isn

On the other hand, if the

penalty for violation of our statute relative to the
obscuration of the motor vehicle license plates were to be
the death penalty, perhaps sincerety of persons would be
more questionable*
QUESTION:

You mean that if we rule in favor of the

Appellees that everybody will ta,pe it over?
v

MR*.JOHNSON:

This is another matter, Mr* Justice

Marshall, that —
QUESTION:

If everybody is in favor of getting rid

of It, you ought to get rid of it*
MR* JOHNSON: ' This is not a burning issue within the
State of New Hampshire*

And this is one of the bases on which

I would distinguish this case from the flag cases*
Mr* Chief Justice Burger, in remarks this past summer,

I believe, at a commencement address at one of our national
universities

11

MR a CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
there,

I was speaking all alone

I didn't have eight colleagues to consult about my

position*
(laughter)
MR* JOHNSON:

I believe It was at the University of

Pennsylvania in which you drew the distinction between the
strong dissent of the 1960*8 and the world peace of today.
This is not a burning issue, Mr. Justice Marshall in
New Hampshire.
Prior to this particular case, there were two
combined cases before the New Hampshire Supreme Court cited
in the State's brief, State v% Hoskln and Ely, in which the
defendants therein had taped over the State motto.
QUESTION:

Then, I understand the Attorney General’s

office doesn't have anything else to do, that's why they
brought it up here.
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

We have sufficient work in New Hampshire.

Is it Important in the State of New

Hampshire or not?
MR. JGHNSGN:

It is very important, Mr. Justice
V.

Marshall.
QUESTION:

But it is not a burning Issue.

MR* JOHNSON:

It is not a burning issue from the

standpoint that when one goes to New Hampshire one sees the
motto taped over.

12

If I may Introduce a piece of evidence not before the
Court. 3h my travels around the State of New Hampshire since
this case first was instituted, I personally have yet to see
within the State of New Hampshire a license with the State
motto either cut out or taped over*
QUESTION:

Since you are speaking as an individual,

the first time I noticed the motto was after this case was
filed»

I hadn't ever paid any attention to it.

I noticed

New Hampshire license and I'd say, "Well, there's somebody
from New Hampshire," but I didn't live or die about it.
(laughter)
MR» JOHNSON:
don't either.

Well, most people in New Hampshire

They accept it as the fact that it is required

to be placed on their license plates by the Legislature In
•i

New Hampshire, which is one of the fundamental bases upon
which the State, the Appellants herein, say that by no stretch
of the imagination can the Appellees be said to agree with the
State motto merely because it is required to be plaeed on their
license plates.

Every —

:

QUESTION: What if the Legislature had required them
to take a choice or to put on the license plate, "Ban all
busing."?

You would regard that as somewhat controversial,

wouldn't you?
MR» JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Suppose, on the other hand,

it

was,

13

"Busing is beautiful."
MR* JOHNSON:

Would you think that was controversial?
There would certainly be people who

would be here before this Court holding that it was contro­
versial.
QUESTION:

What difference does it make if the

particular person finds it obnoxious and objectionable or
whether it's approved by a majority and disapproved by only a
small minority?
MR.JOHNSON:

I think, then, we get down to a balancing

Issue, balancing the interests of the State versis the
eccentric feelings of a very small minority.
QUESTION:

Do you think it is likely that either of

the hypothetical put to you by the Chief Justice would be
adopted by the New Hampshire Legislature as the State motto?
MR. JOHNSON:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

We have

adopted our motto and I don't believe it would be changed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, a minute ago you

said it would be very troubles erne to issue license plates
without this on it.
I saw a license plate from New Hampshire a week ago
that had the letters "ER" on it, or "AB" or something with
two letters.

Well, that was printed specially, wasn’t it?

Wasn’t that stamped specially?
MR. JOHNSON:

Each plate has its own numbers and each

plate has its own letters.

14

QUESTION: But I mean they go from one to nine
thousand.

That's a machine job, but the letters nER,{ is not

a machine job.

No computer runs out "ER."

MR. JOHNSON:

In a sense ~~ or I believe that it

does because the letters in New Hampshire stand, generally,
for our nine counties.
QUESTION:
it.

And so the counties do have significance.

But this didn't have any numbers behind

It just had letters.
MR. JOHNSON;

Well, then, that is what is called in

New Hampshire a vanity plate.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

And that —

Couldn't you make a vanity plate for this

man. If he paid for it. and leave the —
MR, JOHNSON:

Unfortunately, all vanity plates in

New I Hampshire have the State motto on it.
QUESTION;

Yes, but couldn't you make a vanity

plate without the motto?
MR, JOHNSON:

Well, then, we come to the issue of

whether the State of New Hampshire is obligated to do so,
the Legislature having authorized the motto to appear on all
passenger vehicles.
QUESTION:

All I am saying is:

harder than to set the vanity llates,
lawabout it.

It wouldn’t be any

I am not arguing the

I am arguing the hardness of it.

MR. JOHNS ON:

The State has conceded, Mr. Justice

Marshall, in its brief, that the State of New Hampshire can
undertake a workable system of motor vehicle registration
without having the motto on its plates.
QUESTION;

All right.

MR. JOHNSON:

We concede that.

But we are here on

the more fundamental constitutional issue as to whether or not,
in this day and age in the 1970‘s, the State motto may not be
required to be placed on motor vehicle license plates.
On the front of this particular building, is a
slogan, is a motto, "Equal justice under law,*' and I would
submit to this Court with my utmost respect that the work of
this Court may go on without that motto being on the front of
this building, in the same way as I concur with Mr. Justice
Marshall that the State of New Hampshire may undertake a
workable motor vehicle registration system without having
the motto on our license plates,
QUESTION:

General Johnson, just to give you a

question somewhat like the one the Chief Justice asked:
Supposing the State of Utah adopted a motto, "The Mormon State,
and then tried to put that on its licence plates.
be permissible?

Would that

And if not, -why not?

MR, JOHNSON:

I think that it would be a closer

issue, the reason being that I would submit the words, "Live
free or die," do not have the significant meaning that the

16

words. ‘'The Morman State,*' have,
QUESTION:

I suppose If one were a Christian Scientist

and didn’t believe In death it might have
MR. JOHNSON;

That is correct.

—
And I would point

out that almost every State in the Union has mottoes or
slogans on its license plates,
QUESTION:

Are there any other States that have

mottoes that profess a belief in death?

And x</hy is a belief in

death any different from a belief in the Mormon religion?
MR* JOHNSON:

With respect to the first portion of

your question, no, there is no other license plate professing
a belief in death.
With respect to the second aspect of your question,
I think that the more particularIzed the message becomes, then
perhaps the more weight has to be given to the State interests.
QUESTION:

Well, you could do like we do in Virginia.

We don’t have it on our license plate but we have a sticker
I see a lot of people paste on the bumpers, "Virginia is for
lovers," but they didn’t put it on the license plates.

You

could buy the sticker and say what you want.

MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

This is exactly another fundamental —

And in that case, the Appellee here

wouldn’t have had any trouble, would he?
MR. JOHNSON: 'Well, the Appellee herein is a
printer by trade and one of the arguments of the State of New

17

Hampshire herein is chat the statute under 'which he is being
prosecuted does not penalize him for any disparagement of the
motto of the State of New Hampshire, other than a physical act
upon a license plate which is, in a sense, still property of
the State of New Hampshire,

There is nothing in our statute

which precludes Mr, Maynard from verbalizing, either by the
spoken or written word, his objections and dissent to the
State motto.

There is nothing whatsoever to prohibit him from

doing anything other than merely taping over or cutting out the
State motto on our license plates.
And with respect to other statements on license
plates, I could run through the variety of them as appear on
the license plates of various States,
Nebraska, "The cornhusker State,"

Does everyone

seeing a vehicle from Nebraska reasonably believe that the
registrant of that vehicle necessarily himself believes that
Nebraska is a cornhusker State, or that everyone in Nebraska
is a cornhusker?
QUESTION:
"The garden State,"

What about the New Jersey license,
Do you think any resident of New Jersey

believes it is?
(laughter)
MR, JOHNSON:

I certainly would be hesitant, having

driven through New Jersey, with all due respect to New Jersey,
(laughter)

18

MR, JOHNSON:

A license plate hangs out at the end of

the vehicle and nobody can reasonably say that this is an
affirmation of faith, a required affirmation of belief on the
part of a registrant of a motor vehicle.
It is different than a flag-burning case.
different than other symbols and mottoes.

It is

It doesn't have the

emotional charge of a flag or even the emotional charge of a
draft card,
And the Appellants herein would ask this Court to
draw an analogy between the burning of a draft card in the
O'Brien case and the destruction of a duly issued motor vehicle)
registration plate by the State of New Hampshire in the instant
case o
QUESTION: The flags in the flag-burning cases were
all the property of the person who burned them, were they not?
MR, JOHNSON: That Is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
QUESTION:

General Johnson, there are seme New

Hampshire plates that don't carry the motto, aren't there?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

And what is the explanation for that?

MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

There are,

The preliminary statement —

Defendant's Exhibit 8 on page 66 of the

record —
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is it because they have to designate

19

oomraercia 1 or tractor or junk or whatever it is., thereon?
MR, JOHNSON;

There are general rules, motor

vehicle regulations, relating to different types of vehicles,
and that is one of the basic reasons why some plates are
designated commercial or some plates are designated tractor,
A commerc3.al vehicle or an agricultural vehicle, for instance,
may travel only 15 miles from its usual place of resting,
QUESTION:

Yes, but a commercial vehicle, a big

truck van, might go to California,
MR, JOHNSON:

That is correct, but it is designated

as commercial and has to pay highway useage taxes, and so
forth, which a passenger vehicle does not.

In other words,

the various designations are in response to various motor
vehicle laws relative to those particular types of vehicles.
QUESTION:

Mr, Johnson, you have devoted your

argument, up to this time, to the constitutional issues.

Are

you going to address the Younger-Hvffman issue that you raised
in your brief?
MR. JOHNSON:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Powell,

The State relies primarily on Younger v, Harris
and Huffman v. Pursue,
In this particular case, we do not believe that
there is any necessity for the Federal District Court
become involved.

having

The Appellee Mr, Maynard in each of the

three cases in which he appeared before the lowest of our

courts In New Hampshire, had the alternative of having an
appeal by trial de novo before a Jury in the Superior Court
of asking that questions of law be transferred to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court, and he undertook none of those available
reined ies,
In Huffman v, Pursue, this Court held that even
where a criminal action has been commenced and has terminated,
Federal intervention carries with it all those disadvantages
that it would if a criminal proceeding were still ongoing.
Federal intervention in this particular ease, for
example, is an aspersion upon the abilities

of the courts of

New Hampshire to resolve constitutional Issues,
Mr. Justice Brennan in May, before the New Jersey
Bar Association, pointed out that in this day and age the
State courts are protecting the rights cf citizens to even a
greater extent than the Federal Courts,
And I would submit to Your Honors that the courts
of the State of New Hampshire are «just as capable of inter­
preting the Federal Constitution and our own Constitution as
the United States District Court for the District of New
Hampshire.
QUESTION:

With that jurisdictional issue, are not

the husband and the wife here in somewhat different positions?
The husband has already been prosecuted and that case is
closed.

All appeals are no longer available,

But the wife

21

has never been prosecuted, has she?
MR0 JOHNSON: The wife has never been prosecuted.
I would point out —
QUESTION:

Would it not be reasonable for her to

assume that she may be subject to the same kind of prosecution
as her husband?
MR, JOHNSON;

I would submit that under Doran v,

Salem Inn, Inc, and under Ellis v. Pison that there is no
controversy pending and that the parties are so closely related
that they should be treated as one entity,
I would respectfully request that my remaining
minute' or two be reserved.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, Kohn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. KOHN,ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR, KOHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to address the Younger abstension
Issue first.
The purpose behind Younger v. Harris and other cases
that the Court has decided, expanding Younger, has been to
permit State Courts to try cases free from the interference of
the Federal Courts.
In this case, there was no interference with any State

22

litigation.

At the time the suit was filed in Federal Court

there were no pending prosecutions.. This was not a collateral
attack on any of Mr* Maynard's prior convictions, and it was
not an attempt to use the Federal Courts —
QUESTION:

Although the latest proceeding hadn't

terminated yet, had it?
MR* KOHN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I should say —
QUESTION:

Was the suit aimed at that latest

proceeding, or not?
MR, KOHN:

No, sir*

As a matter of fact at the time

I filed the Federal suit, I did not know about the third con­
viction for which Mr. Maynard had received a disposition of
continued for sentence,

I didn't find out about that until —-

QUESTION:

Is that still at stance now?

MR* KOHN:

Yes, sir, but at the hearing before the

three-judge court, the State stipulated that under New Hampshire
practice that is a final disposition, and —
QUESTION:
wholly prospective.

Your assertion is that this suit was
It wasn't aimed at any pending criminal

proceeding and didn't attempt to upset any past ones.
MR* KOHN:

That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION,:

And certainly didn't purport to try to

enjoin any State proceeding.
MR. KOHN:

No.

Only we asked for prospective

QUESTION:

You asked for declaratory and injunctive

MR» KOHN:

That's correct* Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Then* why was this a case : or controversy

in the Federal Court under — what was that companion case with
Younger from the 7th Circuit?
MR» KUHN:

Samuels v„ Mackell?

QUESTION:

Samuels v6 Mackell* I guess»

MR» KOHN:

Well. Samuels v„ Mackell* Your Honors was

a ease where the Federal plaintiffs were seeking a declaratory
judgment that the statute was unconstitutional ~
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR» KOHN:

—> at the same time that there was an on­

going State prosecution»

\

QUESTION:

No* Icm thinking of the case where there

was no prosecution on-going.
QUESTION:

Boyle v, Landry?

QUESTION:

Boyle v. Landry* was that it?

MR. KOHN:

I believe so* Your Honor»

Yes* Your

Honor* and the Court did address the question of standing in
that case.

But in Boyle the Court characterized the plaintiff6s

standing as a search through the statute books to try to find
a statute to attack* if I remember the case correctly.
In this case* Mr» Maynard had been prosecuted.

Ac the

time I filed the Federal action, I knew at least two times.
There was no question that he was not going to alter his
religious beliefs and that unless we filed the suit and got an
injunction he would either not be able to use his car or be
subject to more criminal prosecution.
Mr. Maynard was in a situation where because of his
religious beliefs he was going to be subject to a series of
repeated prosecutions unless the Court intervened and stopped
it.
QUESTION:

You alleged that in your complaint, did

MR» KQHN:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe I did.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kohn, in Dyson there was attempt in

you?

the prayer, as I recall, to expunge a prior conviction.

backwards.

MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

You didn't seek that relief in this case?

MR. KOHN:

No, Your Honor.

Dyson, in effect, looked

They were seeking an expungement of arrest records.

They asked for an injunction to accomplish that.

They also

asked for a declaratory judgment which looked to the future.
Our case looked only to the future, and that's the distinction
between ours and Dyson v, Ellis.
The exhaustion requirement that the State would have
the Court engraft onto 1983 action, under these circumstances,
in effect, would bring the exhaustion requirement that's

25

presently applied in habeas corpus actions into the 1983 area»
Our response to that is to say that in the habeas
corpus area5 it makes sense to require a litigant to exhaust
his State remedies because he is seeking release from con­
finement .
This Court has recognized that the State Courts
should have the first crack at resolving any constitutional
difficulties along the ivay.
But again, that is not the situation in our case®
We are in no way attacking or impuning the ability of the State

with respect to prior convictions»
QUESTION:

Why didn't you take the first case up?

MR» KQHN:

Well, Your Honor, I did not represent

Mr, Maynard in the State Court proceedings.
QUESTION:

Well, why didn't Mr. Maynard take it up?

MR. KOBN:

After his first conviction on December 6th,

the sentence was suspended»

There was no reason to appeal that.

His second conviction occurred on January 31st and he was again
ordered to pay a fine»

The judge then walked out of the court­

room, and Mr» Maynard explained that -- And at that point
the judge advised Mr. Maynard that he had a right to appeal.
The judge then left the courtroom»

Mr» Maynard explained to

the clerk that he could not pay the fines out of conscience —
QUESTION:

No„

He did not Intend to pay them.

26

MRo -KOHN:

That Es correct, Your Honor.

And at that point, the judge returned and sentenced
him to fifteen days in prison and he was immediately taken to
jail.
QUESTION:

Couldn't he have appealed that?

MR, KOBN:

Your Honor, under New Hampshire law,

notice of an appeal to the Superior Court for a trial de novo
must be filed at the time sentence is declared.

There is a

provision for a late appeal which may foe filed within three
days after sentence is declared.

And there is a further

provision that you can petition the Superior Court for
permission within thirty days after sentence is declared,
QUESTION:

The man says he could have gone through

all of the courts.

Mr. Maynard told the judge that he wanted
He did not say that he could not pay for

a lawyer.
QUESTION:

Well, he still had them all available to

him and eventually when he decided to abandon the New Hampshire
courts he found a lawyer to get him into the Federal Court.
MR. KOHN:

I don't think that's accurate, at all,

QUESTION:

—• on a constitutional question.

QUESTION:

If New Hampshire said the statute

was unconstitutional* surely, the New Hampshire prosecutor
wouldn't continue to enforce it.
MR, KOHN:

That is correct* Your Honor* but that

would have been after a substantial period of time.
When Mr, Maynard got out of jail on February 28th of
'75* he didn't use his car until the Federal Court action was
filed.

And he would not have used his car until the constitu­

tional issue was resolved in some court.

That could have been

a matter of many months.
And there is testimony in the transcript on our
motion for a temporary restraining order that this nonsense
affected his ability to earn a livelihood.

critical thing for Mr. Maynard.

30

MR, KQHN:

Yes, sir.

I'd like to respond to Mr. Justice Stewart's question
about the transfer.

There is a transfer procedure in New

Hampshire, and if the justice of the District Court so permits,
you can transfer a case direct to the State Supreme Court,
QUESTION:

To determine a constitutional issue,

MR, KQHN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

Courts in New Hampshire are not courts of record.

But District
You would

have to go to the State Supreme Court without a record, which
in view of the State's consistent attacks on Mr„ Maynard's
sincerity in the Federal Courts, I think would have been a
very poor mistake.
This Court has many times stated in its opinions that
constitutional issues take on color from the factual surround­
ings in nhich they arise,

Mr. Kohn —

MR0 KQHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

— the Attorney General's brief states

that the constitutional issue was raised at the initial trial

MR* KOHN:

Not on Younger principles, Your Honor,,

I think then the —
QUESTION:

How about res Judicata?

MR» KOHN;

Res judicata, which is what I think the

State is really arguing in this case*

Their whole Younger

argument is really dressed up as res judicata.
But our answer to that is that it was waived„

Res

judicata and collateral estop are affirmative defenses that
have to be raised by the State and they did not do so in this
case,
QUESTION:

What if the State doesn't raise them but

the District Court, nonetheless, passes on them, as the District
Court did here?
MR* KOHN:

Well, the rules provide — First of all,

Your Honor, the District Court did not pass on them*

The

District Court —»
QUESTION:

I would have read its opinion to pass on

MR* KOHN:

I read its opinion as being strictly over

them*

the dictum, that if the. State had. raised that argumtait- they
would have rejected it.

But I think that the burden is on the

State, or the defending party, to raise his affirmative
defenses in conformance with the Federal rules of civil
procedure.
QUESTION:

We have lots of cases where, under our

32

rules, you must have raised a point at the earliest possible
point in State proceedings,, but, nonetheless, we've also held
that if a State Supreme Court passes on the point, even though
it didn't have to, then the issue is open for us„
MRo KQHN:

Yes, sir0

I've stated my position, but I would ask that If the
Court feels that you want that — the issue of whether res
.judicata and collateral estoppel apply to 1983 actions, that
you direct the parties to brief that, because the State hasn't
briefed it and we haven't responded to it,

It is a question of

infinite complexity that should receive briefing*
QUESTION:

I am a little puzzled about the res

judicata argument, because I don't understand you to be
attacking the judgment, any of those judgments that have been
entered„
MR, KQHN;

That is correct, Your Honor*

Res judicata

wouldn't apply in any event, and they did waive that*

They

did raise collateral ~~
QUESTION;

Well, If they didn't waive it, you are

not attacking those judgments.
MR, KOHN:

That's correct.

They did raise a

collateral estoppel argument In a motion to dismiss in the
District Court when we began the case.
QUESTION;
issues of law?

And Judge Bownes —■

But does collateral estoppel apply, to

MR,, KOHN:

Honor, although I know that some courts say it only applies
to issues of facts»

There are Federal Courts that have applied

it to questions of law*
pursued that issue,

They raised it before Judge Bownes.

decided against them.
three-judge court.

But, in any event, the State has not
He

They did not raise it again before the

As I note in my brief, there Is a question

as to whether Judge Bownes should have denied that particular
motion the way he did, but the fact of the matter is that the
State abandoned it and the only time they have mentioned it
since is in its brief and not its jurisdictional statement that
was filed with this Court*
I would again ask that if the Court f,eels that issue
should be reached in this case that we should be able to brief
it»
There is an additional question which the State, sort
of, combined with its Younger argument which we feel is a
separate question and that goes to the permanent conjunctive
relief that the District Court answered»
Again, this is an issue we feel the State has waived
and the District Court said that the State did not dispute it,
that the Federal Court could issue an injunctive relief against
threatened arrests and prosecutions.

And that is what they

did in this case»
I would want to point out that there were no

34

prosecutors or Judges as defendants in this ease,

The reason

we asked for injunction against arrests and prosecutions is that
in Weitf Hampshire frequently police officers initiate prosecu­
tions in District Court*

and the injunction that the Court

issued only runs to those individuals.
This was an extremely narrow injunction.

It was

nothing like the injunction that was issued in Rizzo v. Goode
which involved the internal workings of a police department.
All this injunction directed was that the Maynard cs not be
arrested or prosecuted for the offense of taping over the
motto on their license plates.
The State has briefed another issue with respect
to Mrs, Maynard,

They have argued that her action be dismissed.

based on some language in Doran v. Salem 31nn* that she and her
husband were so closely intertwined that if he is barred by
Younger then she must be,,
At common law* husband and wife were one and the
husband was the one* but that is no longer the case.
Mrs. Maynard's action was not a subterfuge to
circumvent Younger considerations.
own*

She had standing on her

She -was threatened with prosecution,

She shares her

husband's religious beliefs* and there is no question but that
she had Article III standing.
We would argue that irrespective of whether Younger
governs Mr. Maynard's case* Mrs. Maynard's must proceed to the

35

merits ,
The central question in this case is whether the
action of the Maynard's in placing reflective tape over the
State motto on their license plates is protected by the
First Amendment as symbolic expression, ancl whether the State's
interests are substantial enough to override that expression,,
QUESTION;

Aren't there two rather separate First

Amendment issues here?

First, the one that you've Just

summarized,» -•*
MR, KOHN:

Yes, sir,

QUESTION; -« whether or not this was affirmative
symbolic expression on the part of your clients,
And, isn't the second issue whether or not a person
can be compelled to advertise a belief in which he does not
believe?
MR, KOHN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

As a matter of fact —
QUESTION:

And aren't they rather separate and

MR, KOHN:

Definitely.

separable?
And 1 would argue that there

is a third separate issue which involves the Free Exercise
Clause because Mr. Maynard's belief and Mrs, Maynard's belief
is religiously based.

And I would see those as three separate

arguments,
QUESTION;

What's the third?

I want to be sure ~~

36

MR» KOHN:

The Free Exercise Clause, Your Honor»

QUESTION;

And why?

MR» KOHN;

Because Mr, Maynard*s beliefs are

Because —

religiously based and that the imposition by the State of this
motto upon him* which is offensive to those beliefs* violates
his —• the Freedom of Exercise —
QUESTION;

Well* thatcs really the same as the

second* except one is involved on the free expression and the
other on the free exercise of religion»
MR» KOHN;

That's correct, Your Honor»

QUESTION:

It is compelling somebody to advertise a

belief in which he doesn't believe, either because — to which
he .doesn't subscribe either because of religious reasons or
political or philosopical reasons,
MR* KOHN:

That's correct*

Yes, sir*

QUESTION;

Well, could the State compel a person to

advertise a neutral concept that did not offend the religion
clauses?
MR, KOHN:

I think that would fall within ~~

you knot*;,

most of the mottoes that appear on State license plates —
If a State wants to advertise —■
QUESTION:

You are not conceding that they are all

valid, are you?
MR* KOHN;

No*

Absolutely not*

North Carolina's is "First In freedom,” and I know

37

there have been problems with that*
Bit, nevertheless, most of the slogans that appear or:
license plates advertise a State as a vacation land, or a
sportsmen's paradise,or its a tourist attraction, or something
that is neutral.
QUESTION:
paradise"?

What If Nevada's said, "Gamblers'

And a Nevada citizen said, 1!I am just very

fundamentally opposed to gambling,"
MR, KOHN:

I think that's right.

I think that if

he taped over the "gambling," that x*ould be an exercise of
sjnabolic expression.
And, I think that before the issue of the environ­
mentalists came up, if the State advertises itself as a
garden State or a scenic State and someone is deeply offended
by that, I think that is symbolic expression,
Our case is much stronger because Mr, Maynard's
beliefs are religiously based.
QUESTION:

Mr, Kohn, then you don't agree that the

license plates belong to the State.
MR, KOHN:

That is correct, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

X assume so.

MR, KOHN:

That is correct.

As a matter of fact,

seven States, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Delaware,
Puerto

R5.CO

and North Carolina, specifically say in their

statutes that the State retains title to the license plate

38

while it is in the possession of the individual.
New Hampshire does not„
QUESTION;

That still wouldn't avoid the problem

of the power of the State to compel a citizen to carry picket
signs,
MR, KOHN:

No.

And 1 wouldn't want to suggest that

if someone came into this Court next week with a North Carolina
license plate, that the case should turn on whether the State
asserts title or not.
Yes, sir.
QUESTION;

Do you think an atheist could cross off

the words or tape over the words,

‘'In God we trust,” on American

currency?
MR. KOHN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that —

QUESTION:

Have a constitutional right to do that,

»

is what I mean,
MR, KOHN:

There are at least two answers to that,

Your Honor,
First of all, the statutes which make that a crime
require a fraudulent intent, so I don't think there would be
a violation of law, at least under the present statute if that
were done,
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume the statute was —

MR. KOHN:

Secondly, if someone chose to ~~ who

really objected to the motto, ,!In God we trust,” and put tape

39

over it the way Mr, Maynard does with license plates, I do not
think, he could be criminally punished for that because —
QUESTION:

There is a statute on mutilating currency»

MR, KGHN:

This is not mutilation. Your Honor.

This

is exactly what the Court was talking about in Spence.
QUESTION:

If you cut out the words with a razor

blade, "In God xve trust," would that be mutilation?
MR, KOHN:

I think it might, Your Honor, yes.

Well,

I know it would be mutilation and I think the State could
probably make that a criminal offense.

That's not this case.

QUESTION:

Didn't he deface the plate?

MR. KOHN:

In the beginning, yes, Your Honor.

He

used to tape the motto over and neighborhood children would
cut out the words — neighborhood children would pull the tape
off.

So, eventually, he cut out the words, "or die," and then

put tape over the whole thing.
But, when we filed our suit, he had just been issued
new plates for 1975 and we have never suggested that he be
able to cut out or actually physically mutilate the license
plates.

That is not an issue.
QUESTION:

There is one other thing that I am a little

confused, in the record, because it seems to me it is inconsis­
tent.

Were the Maynard's willing or unwilling to purchase a

vanity plate?
MR, KOHN:

They stated that they were willing to

40

purchase a licence plate that did not contain the motto,
"Live free or die»"
QUESTION:

But they did not.

MR, KOHN:

They were not offered that opportunity by

the State, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't anyone privileged to do that?

MR, KOHN:

Well, the vanity plates in New Hampshire,

as they are currently printed up, all contain the motto,
"Live free or die," and it would have required removing the
die that says, "Live free or die."

And there is testimony in

the transcript that that could be done without a lot of
difficulty, but the State never said that that could be done.
As a matter of fact, I think they said it couldn't b€;
done.
I believe I am accurately stating the State's
position.
The first issue under the symbolic speech question
is whether there is an intent to convey a particularized
message and 'whether that message is likely to be understood.
Contrary to what the State has represented here, this
issue of "Live free or die" on the license plates is a very
hot issue in New Hampshire,
Supreme Court,

It has been to the New Hampshire

This very ease was delayed for eight months

while the Legislature considered a bill that would have made
inclusion of the State motto optional.

People are well aware

41

in New Hampshire about the controversy around the motto and
there is testimony in the record5 on page 291 for example, by
Mr, Maynard, that people would stop him when they say the tape
over his license plate ancl that would give him an opportunity
to talk to them about his beliefs.
I donEt think there is any question but that this
was — that he had a particularized intent and that people
would understand the message.
The State interests that have been advanced by New
Hampshire, pride, individualism, history and tourism, as the
District Court held, are not unrelated to the suppression of
expression,

for the obvious reason that it’s only by conveying

the message that the State gets the point across, whatever the
point may be.
Orthodoxy of thought can be fostered not only by
penalizing those who are deviant In their expression, but also
be granting special privilege and special status to messages
that meet the State's approval.
This is very much like the Shact case, where there
was a statute that permitted the American uniform to be worn
in theatrical productions that glorified or praised the
military but not otherwise.
And that is what the State has done here.
selected a message which they want to project.
billboard — it has to appear on all license

They’ve

They select a
noncommerical

42

license plates in the State and then they make it a criminal
offense to cover that over.
So it is not unrelated to the suppression of
expression and unless the State can come up with some compelling
need.s or unless they can show a clear and present danger that
their interests cannot be served otherwise, then that is not
a valid justification.
The other interest they advance is that it helps
their system of motor vehicle registration»
nonfunctional,

But the motto is

It does not serve any purpose on the license

plate, unlike the numbers or the name of the State or the
date.
And it is our position that the State lacks the
power to require its citizens to bear this sort of motto»
And, as the Chief Justice was asking before, I think
thst if the Court were to uphold this sort of thing, then the
State could require all citizens to wear a pin or an armband,
or they could require you to have a plaque on your door next
to your address saying, "Live free or die.”
I am sorry»

Did you have a question, Your Honor?

And beyond that, there is evidence in the record that
at least with regard to the MaynardSs plate there is no
duplicate plate in the State of New Hampshire, so it would not
present any problem of identification»

government.
card.

Also, 0EBrien destroyed and mutilated his draft

That was the whole point to the exercise*
Mr* Maynard is not destroying the plate.

The war

power is not involved here and —
QUESTION:

Do you think the State is more limited in

the exercise of its residual powers than Congress is when it
is exercising the war power, each i^hen confronted by the same
constitutional guarantee?
MR. KOHN:

Well, Your Honor, I Just think that the

interests that the State has advanced, in this particular case,
come nowhere near

the war power*

It may be that the State has

other powers under its police power, or powers dealing with the
vjelfare of its citizens that could be equatable with the war
power as compared with the national government.
But, certainly, in terms of the interests
that the State has advanced in this case, there is no
comparison,
QUESTION:

Would you think all your arguments would

apply with equal force if the motto on the license plate was
"Don 5t litter,"
MR. KOHN:

I think that would be —

QUESTION: Do you think everyone would agree with
that?

44

MR, KQHN:

That would be a tough one,

I think everyone would agree with that»
QUESTION:

Maybe some people would think the right of

MR, KOHM:
point —

Yes, sir,

I think that you do reach a

I mean, I am sure my brother counsel would argue

that seme people would disagree that — I donf,t know — some
State is a vacation land or that Mississippi is the hospitality
State,
I guess I would have to say that if someone has a
conscientious opposition to this, thinks it isn't true, that
it would be a case of symbolic expression if they taped it
over.
Unless the State can show some overriding need for
that motto, then there can be no criminal penalties attached*
I should make another point in connection with that*
It6s essential to understand this case that it is criminal
penalties that are involved here*
QUESTION;

How about the licenses that say, "Wear

seatbelts *"
m

It does*

QUESTION:

I think it involves liberty*

MR* KQHN:

I suppose it does, Your Honor*

I suppose

It does involve liberty and I think that probably it

would be protected expression if someone covered it.

45

In any event, I would argue that the motto In this
particular case Is so different from these that it almost
stands, sui gener, aside.
"Live free or die," or "The Mormon State," or
"Amnesty now," or any politically loaded message that is bound
to offend sensibilities cannot withstand a First Amendment
attack.
With respect to the Barnett issue which Mr. Justice
Stewart mentioned, the Stated response to this —- and they
didn't actually brief this, but they relied on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court decision in Hoskins, was that, well, everybody
knows that the State motto is required, therefore it can't
offend the Barnett principle.
But I find that totally ununderstandable.

Barnett,

Itself, could have been explained on those grounds.

Everyone

knows that children have to salute the flag, so it doesn't
matter.
Well, that's not the issue in these cases.

The Issue

is whether' it is an afront to the particular individual es
deeply held beliefs.
I think that that concludes my presentation unless
there are some questions.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

very well.

Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Johnson, do you ha-/e anything further?

46

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT V. JOHNSON, II, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, JOHNSON:

Briefly, Mr* Chief Justice and Justices.

During my direct remarks, I was inquired as to whether
the State of New Hampshire is before this Court seriously.
We are here seriously.
There are many mottoes which we have in this country,
and I think that this is an important case.
"In God we trust,” is upon our coins and currency.
"E pluribus unum,” is upon our coins and currency.
"Equal justice under law,” is upon the edifice in
which we appear today.
I think there is something to be said for the
preservation of certain slogans and mottoes.
Next, I would point out that we lawyers are required
to be members of bar associations In many States.

And yet, by

that requirement, it is not implicit that we agree with what
the bar association in each State says or stands for.
When we place postage stamps on our envelopes, those
postage stamps contain symbols and mottoes.
"Liberty depends on freedom of the press," issued
November 13, 1975, by the United States Government, and I am
not sure whether every member of the Judiciary, necessarily,
would believe in that particular motto.
And, certainly, if. a member of the Judiciary were to

47

place a stamp bearing that motto* “Liberty depends on freedom
of the press*“ upon a letter, no one reasonably would believe
that he necessarily concurs with the sentiments —
QUESTION:

Usually*- we don't put stamps on letters „

(laughter)
MR0 JOHNSON:

But* if your secretary* Mr» Justice

Marshall* placed such a stamp on a letter* I don't think that
if I were to receive the letter I would necessarily believe
that you believe in that particularly motto merely because it
was upon your letter,.
I think it is important in this case also that the
defendant mutilated the license plates»

He cut out the words

I think* finally* it is important that there was no
particular message enunciated by the conduct of the Appellees»
The District Court found that by his conduct he
expressed a particular message* a message x-fhieh indicated his
objections *

I would submit that if you were to examine the
Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1* which is before this Court* the
particular license plate* in its condition* and ask yourselves
what message was conveyed by this act of whimsy*that you would
find no message conveyed.
And for these reasons* the State would ask you to
reverse the judgment of the District Court of the State of
New Hampshire

48

Thank, you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you., gentlemen.

The case is submitted*
(Whereupon* at 3:12 o'clock* p.m.* the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
