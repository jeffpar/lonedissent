PROCEEDINGS

MRu CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1704, Clifford Alexander against Louis Fioto.
Mr, Urbanzcyk, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN Lt URBANZCYK, ESQ..,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, URBANZCYK:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on appeal by the Secretary of
the Army from a judgment of the three-judge district court
In the Eastern District cf New York
The case generally concerns a provision of the
Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization
Act, a statute enacted in 1943 to establish retirement pay
for non-regular military servicemen.
4

The provision at issue here, 10 U.E.C. 1331(c)
precludes Appellees and others from becoming eligible for
benefits or retirement pay under this Act.
The District Court held that that statutory
eligibility bar, as it applies to Appellees, violates the
principle of equal protection that inheres in the .uue
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

And the District

Court has, in effect, enjoined the continued enforcement of
t ha t p r ov i s i o n.

4
The pertinent facts of this case are simple and
straightforward,,

The Act x^as passed in 1948f)after the War»

In the Act, Congress for the first time established a modest
form of retirement pay for members of the Armed Forces
Reserve and the National Gu.a3rd»
I use the term,

"modest," because under the compu­

tation formula the amount of retirement pay that an eligible
reservist usually would receive is relatively modest and
relatively small.
In this Gase, for example, the record shows that,

if he were eligible, Appellee Fioto would receive annually
$1100.
Now, to be eligible to receive retirement pay
under this Act, the statute provides, generally, that an
Individual must be at least 60 years old and have performed
20 years of eligible or qualifying service.

But those

general eligibility criteria are expressly made subject to
the exception in Section 1331(c) which Is the statutory
provision under consideration in this case.
section 1331(c) pertains to all individuals who
were in the reserves prior to August 16,

1945«

That date

marks the announcement by Japan that they would uncondition­
ally surrender and the beginning of demobilization in World
War II»
As originally enacted, the statute provided that

5
individuals in the non-regular military service before that
date were ineligible to receive retirement pay if they
failed to perforin active duty service during either world
war0
In 1958, the statute was amended to permit such
individuals to receive retirement pay or to become eligible
to receive retirement pay if they had subsequently served on
active duty in the Korean War.
Appellee Fioto's case, I think, Illustrates the
application of this statute*
Guard from 1933 to 1940.

Mr. Fioto was in the National

The record does not explain the

reasons why his enlistment was discontinued at that time,
but, in any event, his enlistment was discontinued and he
did not serve on active duty

In World War II.

In 1947, shortly after the war, Mr. Fioto rejoined
and

reenlisted in the National Guard and he, thereafter,

served for 20 years until his mandatory retirement age in
1967*

Fioto did not serve on active duty during the Korean

War.
Now, the Retirement Pay Act, as I mentioned earlier,
was enacted in 1948, less than a year after Mr, Fioto re­
enlisted in the Reserves in 1947.
QUESTION: . The reason he didn"t serve in the
Korean War was becuase his unit wasn't activated; isn't that
true?

6
Mr» U.RBANZCYK:

That's what the record -- The

record shows that he did not serve on active duty in the
Korean War because -- that's what the court found
his unit was not activated»
QUESTION:

because

That's correct»

so it was no fault of his»

MR» URBANZCYK:

The reason for his not serving on

active duty in the Korean War, the court found, was through
no fault of his own; that's correcto
QUESTION:

What is the significance of the dates

September 8, 1940, on the one hand, and January 1, 1947, on
the other -~
MRC URBANZCYK:

I can give you the answer to the

second —
QUESTION:

— rather than December 7, 1941, and

August of '45?
QUESTION:

Wasn't that the date of the activation

of the National Guard?
MR» URBANZCYK:
Blackmun.

That's correct, Mr» Justice

On August 27, 1940, Congress passed, and the

President signed, a bill authorizing him to call up the
I

National Guard in this hemisphere for a year,.

And also on

-September 16th the Selective Service Act x^ras passed, so about
that time the Government was beginning to mobilize in prepar­
ation for the war»
Now, the January 1, 1947, date is an interesting

7
one,,

-December 31* 19^6, was the date that President Truman

formally announced an end of hostilities in the World War»
so. even though
QUESTION:

He was a little late getting around to

it.
(laughter)
MR. URBANZCYK:

That's correct.

I think the

history books show that he did that primarily to reduce
excise and other luxury taxes and — but in any event, that
was the date

—

QUESTION:

It had an effect on other legislation

and Executive Orders, I suppose.
MR. URBANZCYK: ' That's right.
In any event, that does mark the, I guess, the
official historical end to World War II for this country.
QUESTION:

Mr. Urbanzcyk, I suppose you concede

that had Mr. Pioto not served prior to World War II he
would be eligible?
MR. URBANZCYK;:
that in this case.

That is correct.

We have conceded

That's right, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

After his retirement, Fioto's applications for
retirement pay were denied, predictably, under Section 1331(c).
and he then filed this lawsuit or* behalf of himself and
others similarly situated.
Now, in the complaint in the district Court and,

8
indeed, until the brief on the merits in this Court,
Appellees have implicitly conceded that they were barred
from eligibility by Section 1331(c)«

Their sole contention*

instead, was that that statute was unconstitutional, and
that has been the focus of this litigation«,
Now, for the first time, in their brief, they make
the contention and it appears to be their principal conten­
tion now1, that the Section '1331(c) does not bar Appellees,
We can only take this to be an implicit acknowledgement of
the weakness of their constitutional argument.
But, before addressing that argument, I should
make mention, then, of what we stated briefly in our brief
and that is that there can be no doubt that Section 1331(c)
bars individuals like Appellees from receiving retirement
pay under this Act,
QUESTION?

'

A person would be barred even though

he had 20 years of service, quite apart from any service he
may or may not have had during these critical dates?
MR, URBANZCYK:

That's correct, Mr, Justice Stewart,.

The class is defined as individuals who have had, now, 20
years of service since 19^5, but who also were in the nonmilitary service at some point prior to 19^5, and did not
serve on active duty during the war,
QUESTION:

oo they are penalized for having been in

the service prior to 19^5?

9
MR» URBANZCYK:

I hate to use the word,

"penalize,"

Mr<. Justice Stewart
QUESTION:

Then made ineligible by the very fact

that they were in the Reserves prior to 1945«.
MR* URBANZCYK:

That's right*

This class must be

presumed to have known in 1948 -- that's when the statute
was enacted —* that they would not be eligible, or that they
could not become eligible to receive retirement pay*

And

this Appellee class, nevertheless, continued their enlistment*
As 1 was saying, the statute could not be written
in any plainer terms*

The general eligibility criteria of

section 1331 are made expressly subject to subsection (c)*
That provision says that no individual who was in the nonregular military service, before August 16, 1945# quote,
"is eligible for retired pay under this chapter, unless he
performed active duty," unquote, and then it goes on to
specify the dates that correspond to the beginning and end
of the world wars and the Korean War*
There is only one reasonable construction of that
statute, I think, and that is that persons described by it,
including Appellees, are, quote,

"not eligible for retired

pay under this chapter*"
Moreover, as we explained in our brief, Congress
understood, both at the time of the statute's enactment and:
subsequently thereafter when it was reconsidering this statist's,

10

that that was the effect of Section 1331(c).
QUESTION:

How many people are affected, do you

know?
MRo URBANZCYK:

No. I am sorry.

One of the problems

with the judgment in this case is that we would have to go
through several million files in order to identify who it was
that might be eligible for this retirement pay,
QUESTION:

And if he had not mentioned this when he

made his claim, he would have gotten it, I guess?
MR. URBANZCYK:

If he had not mentioned what,

Mr» Justice Marshall?
QUESTION:

The earlier service.

MR. URBANZCYK:

No,

I think the application would ,

then have called for the bringing forth cf his records and
the reviewing of his records.
I am not sure what his application looked like.
It is in the record, now, and I forget whether he made
mention of his prior service, but in any event the record
was found and it was seen that he had served prior to 1945
and he was explicitly denied retirement benefits on the
basis of that prior service.
QUESTION:

Has there been an administrative

determination that an applicant can't simply waive any
prior service and say, "I am relying only my 20 years'
service after 1945"?

v

11
MR. URBANZCYK:
QUESTION:

Well, that —

— 847?

MR. UKBANZCYK:

— the waiver would not' 'bo permitted

by the express terms of the statute.
QUESTION:

Has that been decided?

MR. UKBANZCYK:

Well, it has been decided, I would

think implicitly, in this case..
QUESTION:
no effort to waive.

Well, in this case, except there was
It was all brought out, "Here is my

service."
MR. UKBANZCYK:

Well, Mr. Pioto, I think, in his

current brief, has indicated ~~
QUESTION:

He is well aware of it now, I am sure.

MR. URBANZCYK:

~~ that he would be unwilling to

«« or that he would be willing to forego those seven years
and just count on these twenty.
But, the point is, in 1948, Congress made the
determination that it was unwilling to offer this retirement
pay incentive to this individual.
QUESTION:

.Does the amount of the pension depend

on the years of service over twenty, i.e., my question is:
If one has served twenty years does he get the same pension
a3 a person who has served twenty-nine years?
MR. URBANZCYK:

No.

The computation formula is a

little complex, but what it is basically is you take the

12

monthly pay that this person \^ou3.d have received as a
reservist, you multiply it times, 2times the years of
service that he performed.
Now, the catch on that is that a reservist's year
of service may only count <— one year of serving may only
count as 50 days for the purpose of computing the amount of
retirement pay he would receive*

So that, typically, it

would take seven years of service to count for one year in
terms of computing how much retirement pay that person would
receive,
QUESTION:

So if the person did waive his pre-19^7

years of service, he would be waiving something*
MRe URBANZCYK:

That's right.

He would be

receiving less retirement.
I think, though, that the crucial constitutional
question, since I think there can be no doubt that the
statute does pertain to Appellees and does bar them from
receiving retirement pay, is whether the Section 1331(c) is
rationally related to a valid legislative purpose.
As we have explained at length in our brief, the
statute under consideration here is related to the two
principal purposes of the Act.

The Act was designed first

as a cost-effective method of enlisting and maintaining a
peacetime reserve of individuals who would be willing to
fight if necessary, and who would be trained or have the

13

experience feo fight effectively,,
And second* the Act was designed to reward the
past service of those who had performed the functions for
which a militia Is maintained by serving on active duty in
wartIme„
I don't think I need to elaborate these general
considerations beyond what is said in the brief*
In response* Appellees seem to suggest that the
statute was intended to provide* essentially* an undiffer­
entiated incentive to one and all to join the Reserves*
QUESTION:

What would happen with another man who

was in another National Guard that was activated in Korea*,
but didn't go to Korea?
MR, URBANZCYK:

Well, if he was activated and put

on active duty and* therefore* served his country —
QUESTION:

And never went to Korea* he would be

eligible?
MR* URBANZCYK:

Yes* that's correct* he would be

eligible under the statute,
QUESTION:

Both of them would be in the same area*

MR, URBANZCYK:

The point of the Korean statute*

or the Korean amendment* was to permit individuals who*,
for one reason or another, had been unable to fight in the
war* World War II or ~~ if they were called on active duty
then to be able to become eligible to receive retirement pay.

14
QUESTION:

So it all depends on the luck of the

draw as to which one was activated0
MR» URBANZCYK:

I think the general statute pere­

tains to people that —
QUESTION:
around that.

Well, that Ss true.

There is no way

He can't change from one National Guard to

the other, can he?
MR8 URBANZCYK:
Marshall.

I don't know that, Mr. Justice

I don't know —*
QUESTION:

You don't know that?

MR. URBANZCYK:

— what he could do to have

joined on active duty during the Korean War.
QUESTION:

Don't you think it is material?

MR. URBANZCYK:

Well, no, I don't.

I think that

the essential point here —
QUESTION:

The whole point is that whether or not

he is activated is absolutely beyond his control.
MRo URBANZCYK:

But the essential point in the

statute —
QUESTION:

Is that true?

MR, URBANZCYK:

That may well be correct,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Isn't that true?

MR, URBANZCYK:

That it was beyond his control as

to whether or not he served on active duty in the Korean War?

15
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRo URBANZCYK:

I am afraid I can't answer the

question yes or no,
QUESTION:

Do you know whether there was any

provision during that period of hostilities for volunteers to
join the Army?

Was there any statute prohibiting people from

joining the Army?
MR, URBANZCYK:

I am sure there wasn't,

Mr, Justice Marshall,
QUESTION:

Well, he certainly had a power to join

the Army, didn't he?
MR. URBANZCYK:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

Well, isn't that the answer to Justice

Marshall?
MR. URBANZCYK:

Well, there is another answer, too,

I think, although that is certainly one answer,
QUESTION:

Would that have affected his .money?

MR, URBANZCYK:

Well, if he had served on active

duty, in any capacity, I think he would then have been
qualified to receive retirement pay, or to become eligible
for retirement pay,
QUESTION:

The point is —
If he had enlisted the last day of the

Korean War, he would have been okay?
MR. URBANZCYK:
had served on active duty

Yes, I think that's right,

If he

The gist of the statute, I think,

16
is directed at individuals who failed to serve on active duty
during the two world wars.

The rationale was that those

people should not be given an incentive to continue on.
Now, people who served on active duty for the »«
in the Korean War were excused from that exception* but in
the case of Fioto there was simply no reason to excuse him
from the general rationale which supported the exclusion of
him from the retirement benefit statute in the first place.
Now, the District Court's and the Appellee's
constitutional analysis rests principally on a present
comparison of Appellee with another individual who first joined
the service after 1945.

Both individuals served for twenty

years after 1945 and the argument is that there is now no
rational basis for paying one and not the other.
The argument is mistaken* however*

I think,

principally because a present comparison of these individuals
is not the relevant or appropriate comparison.
The Act, as I said, was passed in 1948 mainly to
create an incentive for future service by promising payment
upon the completion of that service.
QUESTION:

Was that not directed, specifically, to

encourage men with combat experience -- with active service
experience, at least — to go into the Reserves?
MR. URBANZCYK:
pu.rpos es

That was one of the essential

17
QUESTION:

Wasn't that the testimony of Colonel

Maas that you refer to in your brief?
MR» URBANZCYK:

That's correct* Mr» Chief Justice*

and* as I was saying* the whole point of the Act was to
revitalize the militia.

Congress understood that this

country had not been adequately prepared for World War IX
and that one of the i';ays to be prepared was to revitalize
the militia and prepare a strong national defense.
Now* the question then —
QUESTION:

Excuse me, before we go on.

The focus

of that revitalization was to get not desk soldiers or just
the ordinary National Guardsmen* but get the young men who
had been in active service during the wartime to move into
the Reserves so that they would have, at least

a partially

c cmb a t-1 rain ed Reserve.
MR. URBANZCYK:

That's correct, and that is, as

you say —
QUESTION:

You rest on that as the basis for a

different treatment of those who have had active duty
service?
MR. URBANZCYK:

That's correct,

I think that was

part of a multi-faceted rationale which was based*
generally, on a practical assessment of the likely future
availability of these individuals and their training for

a at i • ■ e i.. a >• t ime du t y,

18

»

That was the whole purpose of the Act and I
think Gongress pursued that purpose rationally here.
Certainly nothing more than that was required by
the Due Process clause.

If the Act was constitutional in

1948, it would not seem that it should be subsequently held
unconstitutional at the behest of Appellees who knew * or
must be presumed to have known in 1948, that Congress had
not made the promise of retirement pay to them.
The holding of unconstitutionality would be, in a
sense, to supply Appellees with a payment of money that
Congress had explicitly promised would not be paid to them,
I think such a holding would endanger any other
Congressional efforts to provide selective Incentives for
future action, individuals as to whom Congress had chosen
not to provide an incentive

that it had chosen to provide

others, to go ahead and act as if the incentive had been
offered to them, confident that when all was said and done
in the future their expectations would be fulfilled by the
courts.
Thus, viewed from Congress1 perspective in 1948,
which is the perspective, I think, we must use in this case,
this statute is plainly constitutional.
As to Fioto and the Appellee class, Congress may
well now decide to provide them retirement pay, but that .is
something that Congress and not the courts should decide.

19

The final point I wish to make is with regard to
the argument of the amicus brief that as to certain members
of the Appellee class, that is Merchant Marines who fought
or served on Merchant Marine ships in World War II, the
rationales for exclusion don't pertain»
This argument is a little late in coming in this
litigation.

Counsel for the Appellee class did not make it

in the district court and thus the Government hasn't had an
opportunity to develop a factual record on the matter.
I think I should spend a minute or frwo, if I may,
on the merits of the amicus argument.
Of course, one answer to the claim is that even
if the rationales pertain with less force to Merchant
Marines who were in the war, that is certainly not a basis
under the Constitution for invalidating the statute.
To hold a statute unconstitutional because
certain individual members of the class don't fit very well
within the statute's rationale you are contravening the
well-established principle that a statute is not uncon­
stitutional simply because it is mathematically imprecise.
Such a holding would prevent Congress from legis­
lating In this area on the basis of general reasonable
classifications anc! would require them, instead, to legis­
late on the basis of more particularized, even individualized
consideration.

20

That certainly is not required by the Due Process
clause.

Certainly not in this case which involves a statute

indicative of Congress5 attempt to prepare the Nation's
defenses and provides no occasion ~~ this case certainly
provides no occasion for strict scrutiny of the legislation.
But, even given the legal inadequacy or insuf­
ficiency of the amicus argument, I don't think it can be
said that the rationale for exclusion does not pertain to
these people.
As we indicated, there are two rationales in the
statute: to reward past service and to provide an incentive
for future service.
I would submit that neither rationale requires the
extension of the retirement pay to Merchant Marines who are
members of the Navy Reserve.
With respect to the first of these rationales, the
reward rationale, the amicus brief admits that these
individuals were paid more than members of the Armed Services
in the war, and in addition that they received hazardous duty
bonuses for the time that they were in war zones.
Congress could reasonably have determined,
therefore, that an additional reward for their service in
the form of a Government retirement pay is simply unnecessary.
As to the incentive rationale, the amicus points
out that during the war Merchant Marine officers were required

21

to be in the Navy Reserve, and that today they are strongly
encouraged to join the Navy Reserves as a part of their sea­
going profession.
Membership in the Reserves, thus, is a -- has a
close nexus or is, in a sense, an attribute of membership
in the Merchant Marines.
In that respect, Congress could reasonably have
determined that Appellees who were Merchant Marines In the
war needed no further incentive to join the Navy Reserves.
It is true, as the amicu3 points out, that Merchant
Marines who first served after 19^5 can become eligible for
retirement pay under the Act, and I suppose as to those
people, if they didn't need a further incentive, as I have
indicated, to join the Navy Reserves, the statute is,
perhaps, over-inclusive as to them.
But certainly over“inclusion is not a basis for
requiring the Congress to make the statute more over-inclusive
by extending retirement pay to members of the Appellee class.
That kind of argument was rejected in Matthews ve
Lucas and it should be similarly rejected here.
Thus, the argument of the amicus with respect to
certain of the Appellees is not persuasive.
For the foregoing reasons, as well as for those
indicated in our brief, I respectfully submit that the
judgment of the district court should be reversed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr* Urbanczyk.

Mr* Goldfarb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVO GOLDFARB, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GQILFARB:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I {d like to first point out in response that our
complaint in this action did challenge the statute both on
its face and as applied, and the lower court, in its decision
— and I think it stressed that they felt that the court
need not and should not defer to the Army's construction
of the statute which they felt was clearly against the goals
and intent of Congress.
And, therefore, we felt it important here to raise
the issue of the construction of the statute and the Armycs
interpretation -- and the Army8s construction of the statute
as opposed to how it might be construed.
secondly, under the question of waiver, our client,
as every other member of this class, does not need his years
before 1945 to qualify.
In the letter to the Secretary of the Army which 1
wrote on behalf of this client, we said we felt that there
were two independent periods of service.
I think it was clear at that point.

Our letters

to the Board of Correction of Military Records and everybody

23
else bringing this through the administrative proceedings
from the very beginning made it clear that we wished our
client to proceed on his twenty years after 1947* and although
we mentioned the previous years because it was clear that
they were there,, we did not feel that there should be a
reliance on it.
We felt that the intent of Congress in passing
this Act was In 1948 they created a point system to measure
what was a year of good service.

. The Senate, in Its

amendments to the bill that were finally ad opted, said not
anyone who serves a year will qualify.

You have to have so

many days in summer camp and you have to have so many days
of service, making fifty points in all and that gives you
a year to qualify.
Now,the problem was before 1948 there was no such
point system and the question then arose what to do with
people who had years of service before 1948.
Now, the Congress decided — and this is what we
feel is the purpose of this proviso

that in order to have

your years before 194-5 qualify you must have served on
active duty in World War I or World War II, and later as
amended they allowed people who served in the Korean War
to qualify.
QUESTION:
about that?

What is unreasonable and unconstitutional

24
MR, GQLOFARB:

We feel that the intent of Congress

was to let you ~~ In order to get credit for those years
you must have served in the war, but they never intended to
exclude people with twenty years of measurable service under
the

new point system.
We feel that the record here in the Senate and the

House shows that this was to confer benefit and encourage
people to enlist., that the intent is not here to create a
perpetual bar to men such as our client,
QUESTION:

Must you not concede that the statutory

language is very clear? "That a person isn't eligible,11 it
says, "for retired pay under this chapter,"
MR, GOLdFARB:

Well, we think that both the court

below and the U,S, Attorney, at that time -- that it was
legislative oversight in the wording of this statute, that
the intent —
QUESTION:

Would you answer my question, and

then you can explain it,
Don't you think that the language of the statute,
looking nowhere else but to the language of the statute,
quite clearly disentitles your client to retired pay?
MRo GQIDFARB:

The plain meaning of the statute,

we will agree, would disentitle our client to retired pay.
However, we feel that a different construction is to be
given to that

25

QUESTION:

That that's not what Congress meant to

say.
MR. GOLDF-ARB:

We feel that is not what Congress

meant to say and that the Court can give a different Inter­
pretation to the statute*.that you can read in the words*
"shall not qualify for credit for those years before 1945»"
QUESTION:

Instead of "shall not be eligible for

retired pay under this chapter"?
MR. G0U3FARB;

That is correct.

Originally —

Of course there have been some changes in wording
here and codification which didn't Intend to change the
meaning and which is pointed out by the amicus brief.
Originally* it stated "shall not qualify for
retirement benefits," and in other parts of the statute
the words "retirement benefits" were often used to mean to
accrue retired credit during those years.
It is only through codification in 1956, and when
they adopted that same codification in the amendment in 1958*
that this statute became clear in its plain meaning.
We feel there was at least an ambiguity between
*48 and 856 as to the reading of the plain meaning of the
statute:,
QUESTION:

the statute* a man* say — You have two men in 1945, each of
whom has had twenty yea vs in the Reserves* but say one of their.*

years to get his twenty.

Under your view, the statute would discriminate
against the man a portion of whose twenty years' service
was earned before the war.
MR. GOLoFARB:
QUESTION:

Yes, because we feel —

You think that's what the statute

means»
Why do you think the Congress did that?
Why did it discriminate against prewar service?
MR. GOIPFARB:

Well, in the —

The reason we feel like that is that there was
no measurable way of knowing whether that -« how good that
service was before 1948 when they passed the point system»
Therefore, they were in a quandry of what to do with people
before 1948.

They were creating, in a sense, a future

benefit, a future benefit which Mr„ Fioto and his class are
entitled to by their twenty years»
Now, if he had only fifteen years, there were five
years that were in doubt.

And they decided in favor of not

giving them credit for those five years, because there was
no measurable way, since they had not served in a war they
were not giving them that benefit.
measure those other five years.

There was no way to

27
QUESTION:

How did they measure the benefit post-

*48 any differently than just showed up for so many drills
and wasn't put on report, and so aren’t the military records
available to tell how often he served during the prewar
period?
MRr. GOIiFARB:

No*

There was not a way to

measure what the National Reservists were doing*

In '48,

they were revamping the whole structure of this*

They

started the drill system.
for attending these drills,

They started giving them payment
They started giving them credit

for a different number of hours they served.
In fact, the House bill, originally, did not make
this kind of distinction, and it was the Senate who said
we will greatly cut down in the number of people who we are
going to give benefits for, but we are going to make sure that
a year of measurable service in the future is a year in which
*

they put in what we know to be good service.
They call It satisfactory service.
measurable service.

They call it

They were very concerned with that.

And they said every member of our class has those years
after 1945 of what Congress was looking for, good service,
measurable service, satisfactory service.
They are only perpetually barred by having some
previous service*
And also it is very important that that previous

28
service must be previous service in the National Guard or
the Reserves.
If they had military service before -- and
Mr. Pioto did have service in the Coast Guard, back in
'27 to s31, that does not disqualify him.

They don't care for

what reason he dropped out of that or what reason another man
dropped out of the military.

Maybe he was in the military

and the war started and he dropped out.

That's not a bar.

The only bar is having Reserve service before 1945 and not
participating on active duty during World War I or World War
II o
QUESTION:

Wasn't pre-World War II Reserve service

MR. GOIDFARB:

MR, GOLDFARB:

Without pay of any kind.

It is

my understanding the first pay for this was brought In in
‘48 as an incentive.

But there was another incentive.

That

was the incentive to induce men to enlist in the Reserve

that, in saying

I am. talking about the

The National

Guard was paid, wasn't it?
MR. GOLDFARB:

I do not know whether the National

Guard was paid or not at that time.
In the legislative history of this bill, they
speak about the fact that we are trying to induce people to
have long-term service of ten, fifteen and twenty years, that
there is another Act which is passed by Congress to pay them
for their drill, that will encourage them to come into the
Reserves.
What they were trying to encourage vms to retain
men over long periods of time.

They had talked about the

30

exodus between World VJar 1 and 'World War II of people
going in and out of the Reserve, and they say, flThese are the
very people we want to encourage to stay in the Reserves
and, therefore, we are going to give a retirement benefit
for twenty years of service»11
We think that the statutory history shows, the
legislative history shows no intent to penalize and no intent
to create a perpetual bar»
In fact, we feel that the concept here is one of
credit.

And we feel that the words used by the Senators

and in our quotes there show that if there was no wartime
duty they Intended not to give credit for pre-19^5 years,
that they did not foresee the man in 19^8 who might have
twenty measurable satisfactory years of service and still
have, after that date -•» and still have years before 19^-5

which would bar him under the words of the statute.
And we contend that this Court should affirm the
lower court in construing the proviso of dealing with this
concept of credit.
If the Government's construction is given to the
proviso/:we feel ‘that type of a perpetual bar::and""the- way;
it works here is an irrational classification and contrary
to the overall purpose of Congress In passing this legislation

the statute.

He

He gets all the benefits of

He can even have the same Coast Guard service

as Mr. Fioto, that's no bar.

The only difference is that

Mr. Fioto had years in the Reserve previous to 1945.
The age is no distinction.

Both men, coming into

the National Guard or the Reserves in 1947 could be of the
same age.

And this was another point that was asked before

about -- I do not believe that Mr. Fioto during the Korean
War could have enlisted, possibly because of his age„
QUESTION:

As you read the District Courtis opinion,

do you read it to adopt your first argument, i.e„, that under
the statute, as properly construed, your client is entitled
to retirement pay9
Or, do you read it as adopting your second
argument, i.e., that the statute can only be construed as
it is written, but that such a statute is unconstitutional?
MR. GOLDFARB:

I believe -- It is not completely

clear.
QUESTION:

It is not clear to me either.

MR, GOILFARE:

But they do say that it would be

unconstitutional if they adopted the Army's construction.
And, therefore, they put in the sentence and we have it in

QUESTION:

MR, GOLPFARB:

Right.

But 'we felt, as I said, that they had made the

we felt it was an important argument because this Court has
said that the plain meaning of the statute will not necessarily
control where the legislative history shows an intent for
something other than that.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if the Court had just

stopped with saying that the statute was unconstitutional,
as construed, to cover your client, to exclude him, does it

MR. GOLoFARB:

I think in either case if that

he was -- only credit they were talking about, or the
proviso is struck down as being unconstitutional and is no
longer a bar»

In either case, retirement benefits would

have to be paid because -QUEoTXGN:

If the constitutional violation is

that you are treating two classes differently that should
have been treated the same, there is more than one way of
curing the discrimination.

You would just not pay any to

anybody.
MR* GOLbFARB:

I think the problem is there that

the court would only declare the proviso unconstitutional.
They did not declare the rest of the statute -QUEsTIt'N:

How do you know what Congress8 intention

might be if they knew that half their statute was

unconstitutional?
MR, GOU/FARB:

Well, the thing is that we have

the legislative history here which shows the purpose of the
entire statute which was to confer this benefit on people
with twenty measurable years.
The problem here is the words they chose to make
this proviso coming to a head-on collision with the purpose
of the entire statute.

The purpose of the entire statute,

I think, is clear and the legislative history on that is there,
that they intended to confer the benefits on every man with
twenty measurable years of service.
It is the proviso and the way they chose to word
it that creates the problem that when they were talking about
a concept of giving men credit for their pre-1945 service
what happened was the Army has construed that as being a
perpetual bar to any man with pre~19^5 service.
As I said, the age is not a distinction here because
the two men similarly situated, both entering in 19^7* could
be the same age.
Now, the Congress has seen other ways of preventing
-- when they wanted only younger men, and in the amicus brief
they point out a number of these ways that they have done it,
with the ROTC limiting it to men between the ages of 17 and
25, with different branches of the service, that they must

come in at different ages

36
Oo, it seems to be clear that Congress was not
trying to do that here and that they were allowing older men
to come into the Reserves for the first time*
The war experience does not seem to be the
distinction because neither of the men who came in in 19^7
had wartime experience*

The only difference is one didnft

have previous Reserve service*

They both may have had

previous non-wartime service in one of the branches of the
military*

The problem was that Mr* Fioto had seven years

in the Reserves*
We feel that the only difference here is the
additional Reserve service, and we feel that this is
completely irrational In light of the Congressional purpose
of this Act*
There is one other contention that the Government
raises, their last contention, which deals that if the
statute is held not to be a bar to Mr* Fioto and his class
they felt that the district court could not award what they
characterize as retroactive pay*
Now, I would like to make it clear that no matter
when the military notifies a man that he is eligible for
retirement pay, no matter when the date is he puts in his
application, by statute he is entitled to pay as of the first
day he met all of the requirements*

This is 10 11*0*0* Oection

Maas .

MRo GQLDFARB:

That was a very small part of the

testimony, among lets of other purposes„
QUESTION:

Well, as Justice White suggested, there

would be many purposes they would have in mind, but certainly
that testimony indicates that the military were very much
interested in keeping these younger men with active duty
in the Reserves.
MR» GOLDFARB:

I think — There appears to be a

benign purpose to give a retirement benefit to those who
had served on active wartime duty, and to include that
along with the rest of the Act»
As I said, they felt that thejr should not penal —
They did not want to

That does not say that they meant to

create a penalty for everyone else.

It appears that there

was a secondary purpose to make sure that people x^ith active
wartime duty get the benefit of the statute, but there was
no indication that they meant for people with twenty
measurable, satisfactory years of service to be completely

41
and perpetually barred because of some additional service,
regardless of the reasons why they may not have had active
wartime duty*
QUESTION:

Would it have been a rational purpose

had it been expressed

Would it have been a rational

purpose to say that a man who had some substantial prewar
service and then some substantial twenty years after-the war,
but not be given any special favors as compared with the men
who had those factors plus active duty?
Here was a man who had seven years»

He could have

been useful somewhere in the war, could he not?
MR» GOIOFAEB:

The finding of the court below in

this case was that he was not able to participate in the war*
There are many people, as the amicus points out, who for
different reasons could not -- Merchant Marines - r
were excluded because the Government felt that their use
was more necessary in other areas»

There were many people

with civilian jobs that the Government felt were more
important than active wartime service —
QUESTION:

Does this man fall in any one of those

categories?
MR, GOLDFARB:

This man, according to the findings

of fact of the court below, was a victim of a car accident
at approximately the time he dropped out of the Reserves and
had not sufficiently recovered to be in the Reserves at the

42

time of the wsr,

upon facts.
QUESTION:

Where did he find the evidence to make

the finding of fact?
MR. GOLDPARS:

As I recall, I think it was from

questions of oral argument.
We did not feel that the reason that someone was
in or out of the Reserves was relevant to the class.
Obviously, it varied greatly.
QUESTION: So there is no evidence then, at all?
MR. GOLDFARB:
QUESTION:

No.

Well, in the class -- Whatever this

individual's reasons were, that doesn’t affect the class,
does it?
MR. GOLDFARB:

Right.

It doss not affect the

class.
QUESTION:

The class might include people with

reasons similar to this asserted reason, or for no reasons or

reasons of cowardice or reasons or heroism, or all sorts of
different reasons*

The class just is a broad class of those

who have twenty years but some of their service was prior to
these effective dates and during that service they didn't
participate in active duty*
MR* GOLhFARB:

I think our point which we feel is

important on that Is that there were people who also did not
have prior wartime service who came in in '47 or '45 for the
first -- after August 16, 1945, for the first time, were not
even required to serve in the Korean War and could get the
benefit of the statute*

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldfarb, what is your support for

/

your suggestion that there was an inability on the part of
the military establishment to evaluate the quality of the
service performed before 1948?
MR. GOLuFARB:

They — Congress, in passing the

legislation in 1948, in the Senate hearings, said they wanted
to create a uniform system among all the branches of the
service and they created the point system.

And they said that,

they did not want to leave it up to the branches of the servic e
where the Navy would make one system and the Army make another
system and they would evaluate.
Before '48, there does not appear to have been an
evaluation when they were tallying people's service and
I think the records on military men show they just got —
you just put down how many years of service you had.
Now, when you compute someone's years of service,
after '48, you go through a point system of haw many weeks
of drill you had, how many weekends you attended.

There were no records.

gave that because there was no other system.

I think they

There was a

49
cutoff year for the last of the war.

They just made that as

a presumption,,
QUESTION:

I mean they didn't need a point system

to decide those years qualified, is what I am saying.
MR» GOLDFARB:

No* they just gave that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

Lo you have anything further. Mr* Urbanzcyk?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. URBANZCYK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. URBANZCYK:

Just a minute or two, if I may,

Mr. Chief Justice.
X agree with you, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the
district court's opinion is somewhat vague on its intent,
but I think the most reasonable construction is that the
district court held this statute unconstitutional as applied
to Appellees.
I would point out that at Appendix 9 which has the
cause of action stated by the Plaintiffs, that's the only
cause of action stated, that the statute is unconstitutional
on its face or as applied to these particular individuals.
Nevertheless, in spite of that and the plain
language of the statute, there is still the insistence that
the Section 1331(c) doesn't mean that at all.
Nov/, this point system, as we explain in our brief,
is a system,

generally, of measuring an individual*s

50
involvement in the Reserves or the National Guard„

An in-

dividual must get 50 points jio a year to have that year
count as part of his or her 20 qualifying years.
Appellees argue that Section 1331(c) was simply
intended to prevent anyone from including any of their pre~
1945 years of non-regular military service as a part of their

20 years necessary for eligibility,,
QUESTION:

Mr. Urbanzcyk, will you explain to me

hov/ they computed the year in 1946 and
MR, URBANZCYK:

*47?

Well, that's my point.

The point

I would like to make is that if that were Congress’ only
concern, I think they would have pegged the statute to pre1949 service.
The point system was instituted in 1949? July 1,
I949,

Prior to that, they simply presumed that anyone who

was eligible had achieved the 50 points.
The statute provides that any service, and it lists
the kind of service:

in the Armed Services, in the National

Guard, In the Reserves,
QUESTION:

Does that mean attending one drill in

1947 would give a man a full year's credit?
MR, URBANZCYK:

That is correct.

As I understand

it, if you x^/ere a member In good standing in the National Guard
or the Reserves, and X am not certain what that involved^ there
xMas a presumption that that was an eligible year of service,

51
And the point is if 1331(c) was intended simply to
nullify years before the point system was instituted for fear
that that was not a qualifying year, they would have pegged it
to 1949 rather than 1945, because the point system was insti­
tuted only in 1949«
Besides, I think,the structure of the statute
belies their suggestion.

The discussion whether -- or the

provisions determining whether a year of service was a
qualifying year was in Section 1332, dealing with that
subject matter»
This section is in Section 1331 dealing with
general eligibility criteria, and I don't think that there is
any argument that it was intended to pertain to these Appellees
and to preclude them from earning retirement pay»
The original language of the statute, my opponent
alluded to, is no different in that regard,

The original

language of the statute simply says that no person shall be
sligible for retirement benefits.
Elsewhere in the statute, retirement benefits is
used with reference to words like accrued, and in that context
it was construed as meaning accruing points for retirement
benefits„
Our final comment, then, is in regard to the
constitutional argument, and that is that one characteristic
that Mr, Pioto and the other Appellees had that nobody else had

52
in this statute was prior service in the non-regular military
service, but a failure to perform in active duty during the
war o
In 1948, Congress looked at these people and they
said, "As between these individuals and others we want to
provide an incentive to these other people and we want. to
discourage Fioto and the members of his class from joining the
non-military regular service*"
That distinction was rational in 1948 and it should
not be held unconstitutional now on behalf of someone who was
not discouraged,
For those reasons, we respectfully submit that the
judgment of the district court should be reversed.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
{Whereupon, at 11:44 o’clock, a„m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.}
