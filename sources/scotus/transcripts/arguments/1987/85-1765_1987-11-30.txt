ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case presents the question whether large

punitive damage awards may constitute excessive fines, in

MR. OLSON:

QUESTION:

6

MR. OLSON:

Yes, that is correct.
But you are arguing the penalty, also?
Yes, we are.
Thank you.
Because the punitive damage issue is a

logical antecedent to the question raised by the appeal

in this case.

damage.

MR. OLSON:

Exactly.

And for those reasons, and

14

because the other issues, including the appeal penalty, is

15

adequately discussed in the briefs, we would like to

16

concentrate today on the punitive damage question.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, are you arguing the punitive

damages question on the basis of a due process argument as

19

well, or just Eighth Amendment?

20
21

MR. OLSON:

We are arguing both on the basis of a due

process clause objection and on the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Was the Eighth Amendment argument ever

raised in the state courts, Mr. Olson?
MR. OLSON:

On a petition for rehearing, in the

Mississippi Supreme Court, which this Court has held is an

appropriate and not untimely point at which to raise such an
issue, the -QUESTION:

Well, it depends.

You know, if it is

something you could not have anticipated before the Opinion of
the Supreme Court of Mississippi, maybe.

But certainly, your

punitive damages issue could have been raised way back in the
trial court.
MR. OLSON:

We submit that, and perhaps we are

misreading this Court's decision in Hathorn v. Lovorn, but that
this Court held that it is not untimely.

The rule with respect

to Mississippi practice does not regularly and consistently
preclude raising issues in a petition for reconsideration.

And

11 cases were cited in that Opinion to support the proposition
that Mississippi regularly does recognize issues that are
raised on rehearing, in the petition.
QUESTION:

Does it have to?

passed upon.
MR. OLSON:

In the case which I was cited, the

Hathorn case, the issue was not passed upon by the Mississippi
Supreme Court.

In the Petition for Rehearing in this case, the

Appellant raised the issue that the punitive damage award was
excessive, constitutes an excessive fine and violates due
process, equal protection, and other constitutional provisions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, did you abandon your Contract

Clause argument?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

1

MR. OLSON:

We have not abandoned the Contract Clause

2

argument, Justice Blackmun.

We believe that the Contract

3

Clause argument, though, in this case, forms substantially a

4

part of the Due Process Clause argument in the sense that the

5

Supreme Court of Mississippi was in the process of changing

6

subjective standards with respect to the imposition of punitive

7

damages in connection with the enforcement of a contract.

8

we have not abandoned that issue, but it is clearly subordinate

9

to the Due Process Clause issue, and, we submit, to the

So

10

punitive damage question under the Eighth Amendment, which we

11

would prefer to discuss.

12
13

QUESTION:

The Supreme Court of Mississippi denied

your Petition for Rehearing without Opinion, did it not?

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is your Due Process Clause argument

16

limited to the contention that it violates due process not to

17

give you an opportunity to challenge the excessiveness of the

18

penalty; or does it extend as broadly as one of the Amicus

19

briefs would have it, to wit, that a penalty of indeterminate

20

amount is simply contrary to due process?

21

MR. OLSON:

Let me answer that in this way.

In this

22

Court, in 1966, in

Giacco v. Pennsylvania, held that a $230.00

23

penalty imposed upon a litigant after a trial in a criminal

24

case in which the litigant was acquitted, held that a $230.00

25

penalty imposed upon the individual because of reprehensible

conduct, violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution,

2

that a penalty of that nature and that amount could not be

3

imposed on the basis of a subjective, elastic standard, such as

4

the word "reprehensible."

5

In this case, the standard pursuant to which my

6

client was punished is no more clear and no more specific than

7

it was in that case.

The only difference is, in this case the
And that is the principal focus of

Turning to the punitive damage issue, if I may, I

11

don't need to spend too much time reiterating the principal

12

characteristics of punitive damages to this Court, because they

13

are well-known to this Court and have been discussed in many

14

Opinions of this Court.

15

four principal characteristics of punitive damages which have

16

been mentioned by this Court.

17

But I would briefly like to touch upon

In the first place, punitive damages are not damages

18

in the traditional sense.

Damages generally and traditionally

19

are pecuniary reparation.

But as repeatedly characterized by

20

this Court, punitive damages are not to compensate victims.

21

They are only windfalls.

22

his opening statement, we are asking you to return a sizable

23

verdict that is not to compensate Lloyd Crenshaw.

24
25

QUESTION:

As counsel for Mr. Crenshaw stated in

Mr. Olson, you say "windfalls," haven't

QUESTION:

Well, it connotes to me at least that it

is something like a penalty or punishment, doesn't it?
MR. OLSON:

Yes, exactly.

Something that will

7

"smart" or "sting."

8

characteristic being that they are not compensatory.

9

That was my next point.

The first

The second characteristic which this Court has

10

identified is that they are in the nature of a punishment.

11

They are private finds, as articulated by this Court, levied by

12

civil juries.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

That comes right out of the word

"punitive."
MR. OLSON:

That comes, of course, out of the word

16

"punitive," and on jury instructions, and the history of

17

punitive damages, which have been considered over and over

18

again by this Court, make it very clear, as characterized by

19

Chief Justice Rehnquist, punitive damages are quasi-criminal.

20

The third characteristic that is worthy to focus on,

21

and before I do that, with respect to the characterization of

22

punitive damages as criminal and as for punishment purposes,

23

again, the same theme was reflected in the jury instructions

24

and the arguments to the jury in this case.

25

The third characteristic which has been mentioned by
8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

&

1

this Court is that the standards for the imposition of punitive

2

damages and subjective and elastic.

3

punitive damages range from reprehensible to wanton, to

4

negligence, to bad faith, and, in Mississippi, even rudeness.
As Justice Brennan put it, in one case, juries award

5
6

The standards for imposing

punitive damages in their largely uncontrolled discretion.
The fourth characteristic, beyond the standard, is

7
8

that the magnitude of punitive damage awards is utterly

9

capricious.

In words familiar to this Court, punitive damages

10

are awarded in wholly unpredictable amounts, bearing no

11

necessary relation to the actual harm caused.

12

Juries have awarded, in this country, up to $3

13

billion in punitive damages.

14

have sustained jury awards up to $1 billion in punitive

15

damages.
With those four characteristics of punitive damages

16
17

Appellate Courts in this country

in mind, I would like to turn to the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

18

Excuse me.

When an Appellate Court reverses or

19

asks for a remittitur of punitive damages, what does it base it

20

on?

21

what?

22

What does the Appellate Court say?

MR. OLSON:

This is too much, or

That's about it, Justice Scalia.

articulation as to why awards are upset or why punitive damage

awards are sustained.

effect that the punitive damage, it did not matter whether it

4

too high to shock the judicial conscience of the Supreme Court

5

of Mississippi.

6

understand the difference between shocking the conscience and

7

shocking the judicial conscience, and I won't go into that.

But that is about as subjective and as elusive, and as elastic,

as the standards are at the Appellate Court level, as they are

at the jury level.
Before turning to the affirmative reasons why we

11
12

submit that punitive damages are subject to the Excessive Fines

13

Clause of the Eighth Amendment, I think it is my obligation to

14

discuss very briefly the statement of this Court in Ingraham v.

15

Wright that the Eighth Amendment applies only in criminal

16

cases.
We submit that that is not dispositive of the issue

17
18

that we bring before you today, for several reasons, but I will

19

only

mention three here.

20

In the first place, as this Court is well aware,

21

Ingraham applied only to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments

22

Clause of the Eighth Amendment.

23

the Eighth Amendment has a separate history, independent of the

24

Bail and the Punishment Clauses of the Eighth Amendment.

25

The Excessive Fines Clause of

Secondly, this Court noted in

Footnote 37 of

fc.

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Ingraham v. Wright, that some punishments, though not labeled
criminal by the state, may be sufficiently analogous to
criminal punishments to justify application of the Eighth
Amendment.
We submit, and I think some of the things that I have
said already today, support the proposition, that this
punishment is sufficiently analogous, though not labeled
criminal.
QUESTION:
itself?

What about the Excessive Fines Clause

Does it apply to states?
MR. OLSON:

We believe that the Eighth Amendment, the

Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause has been held applicable
to the states.

This Court has never held that the Excessive

Fines Clause applies to the states, but there is no reason to
distinguish between the Excessive Punishments provision of the
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment
from the Excessive Fines Clause.
QUESTION:

You just told us there was a reason.

You just told us the two were quite different.
MR. OLSON:
QUESTION:
MR. OLSON:

Because of the separate history.
Right.
That is a reason to distinguish the

Ingraham case, which was not focusing on the Excessive Fines
Clause, and on the history of the Excessive Fines Clause, but
not a reason to take that one level of punishment, which may be
11

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

a companion in many cases in the same case, and distinguish it

2

from application to the states.
The third reason, and your question leads me to that,

3

.

4

is that the historical analysis in Inqraham, as Justice White

5

pu it, in his dissenting Opinion, was vague and inconclusive.

6

We believe that the reason for that was that was, as we have

7

examined the briefs, and the historical analysis of the Eighth

8

Amendment, tracing back to the English Bill of Rights and to

9

Maqna Carta, was not thoroughly briefed in Inqraham v. Wriqht.

10

And that leads me to the affirmative reasons why we believe

11

that the Eighth Amendment does apply, the Excessive Fines

12

Clause of the Eighth Amendment does apply to punitive damages.
There are three principal reasons why we advance

13
14

affirmatively, that the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause

15

does apply to punitive damages.

16

They are, the language in the drafting and

17

legislative history of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth

18

Amendment; the purpose of the Excessive Fines Clause of the

19

Eighth Amendment; and, as I have mentioned, the historical

20

antecedents of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth

21

Amendment.

22

First of all, the legislative history, the language

23

and drafting.

Nothing in the text of the Eighth Amendment

24

itself limits it to criminal cases.

25

the Amendment, in the text of the Amendment, that it should be

There is no suggestion in

k.

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

limited to criminal cases.

2

the Eighth Amendment was debated immediately after the Fifth

3

Amendment during the First Congress of the United States.

4

Because

During the debate of the Fifth Amendment, in order to

5

ensure that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth

6

Amendment would not extend beyond the criminal cases, the

7

framers added a clause so that it would read:

8

any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness

9

against himself."

10

„

And that is interesting.

"... nor shall

The word "criminal" also appears in the

Sixth Amendment.

11

Thus, the legislative history of the drafting of the

12

Eighth Amendment suggests that the framers knew how to include

13

the word "criminal" if they had wished to do so.

14

Similarly, as this Court has noted, the Eighth

15

Amendment traces its history back to the English Declaration

16

and Bill of Rights of 1689.

17

of Rights, the word "criminal" cases modifies the Bail

18

Provision of the Declaration of Rights.

19

20

the English Bill of Rights, the word "criminal" cases is not

22

provision or of the Bail and Cruel and Unusual Punishments

23

provisions of the Declaration of Rights.

In the Preamble to the Declaration

But when enacted in a

24

Furthermore, this Court has noted that the Eighth

25

Amendment also can be traced to the Virginia Declaration of

1>

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Rights of 1776.

It is interesting that Section 9 of the

2

Virginia Declaration of Rights prohibits excessive bail, fines,

3

and cruel and unusual punishment, without any reference to

4

criminal cases.

5

of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, sets out a whole series

6

of rights and protections in capital or criminal prosecutions

7

So that the language and the legislative history of

Section 8, the immediately preceding section

8

the Eighth Amendment does not support limiting that Amendment,

9

the Excessive Fines Clause, to criminal cases.

10

From the standpoint of a purpose of analysis, as

11

suggested by Justice White in the dissent in Ingraham v.

12

Wright, I think that I need no say any more.

13

serve the same function as criminal fines.

14

the standpoint of the analogy suggested in Footnote 37 of

15

Ingraham v. Wright or the purpose of analysis, it is quite

16

clear that the Excessive Fines Clause should apply to punitive

17

damages.

18

Punitive damages
So therefore, from

From the standpoint of the historical analysis, the

19

more one examines the history of the Excessive Fines Clause,

20

and its antecedent, the Excessive Amercements Clause of Magna

21

Carta, the more one is stricken by the similarity between

22

punitive damages and amercements as they were understood in the

23

13th Century and throughout the period of history, leading up

24

to the word "fines" in the Declaration of Rights of 1689.

25

The history demonstrates that amercements, the

concept of proportionality, in the first place, does not date

2

from Magna Carta.

3

ancient law, even to municipal law in England, prior to Magna

4

Carta.

5

upon the proposition that disproportionate, unduly severe,

6

arbitrary or capricious punishment is unwise and unjust, and it

7

does not support a proper system of justice.

It dates back to ancient Hebrew law, to

The concept of proportionality in punishment is based

8

Saxon law did not distinguish between crimes and

9

torts, and English law combined the concept of private and

10

public wrongs, and remedies for private and public wrongs.

11

Amercements, and later, fines, were imposed for virtually every

12

form of conduct, including civil misconduct, and upon civil

13

litigants.

14

By 1689, the date of the Declaration of Rights in

15

England, the terms "amercements" and "fines" were relatively

16

interchangeable.

17

moderation in punishment, both in the area of fines and in

18

amercements, were embodied, those concepts were embodied in

19

those charters as well.

20

And in the Colonial charters, the concept of

Book III of Blackstone discusses private wrongs, and

21

it is interesting to examine that history, because Blackstone

22

discusses, in chapter' after chapter, that many of the things

23

which he describes as private wrongs contain both a private

component and a public component.

that this Court adopts, if it agrees with us that the Eighth

Amendment does indeed apply to punitive damages?

articulated this in our Brief, and let me just restate it

6

briefly, that the objective standards to which this Court

should turn in determining whether a fine is excessive is to

Mr. Olson, if we proceed in this case

If we were to find in your favor, on the other hand,

on the basis of the Due Process Clause, and on the ground that

13

the vice here is not the excessiveness of the fine or at least

we don't have to reach that, but simply the fact that a fine

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR., ESQUIRE

9

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

10
11

MR. ENNIS:

We

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

12

Although I will certainly address the punitive

13

damages issues, I would like to begin by addressing the

14

rationality of the appeal penalty statute, because in our view,

15

that is the only issue that is properly before the Court.

16

The penalty statute serves several legitimate state

17

interests, including the indisputably legitimate interest of

18

conserving judicial resources, protecting the integrity of

19

judgments, and providing some measure of compensation for the

20

real but difficult to measure intangible costs of defending

21

appeals.

22

The statute applies egually to all parties who appeal

23

from money judgments.

If Lloyd Crenshaw had unsuccessfully

24

appealed from the same judgment at issue here, he would have

25

incurred precisely the same 15 percent penalty that Bankers

Heritage

22
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

fc.
1

Life incurred.
The statute conserves judicial resources by-

2
3

discouraging marginal appeals without preventing them.

4

Discouraging appeals in marginal cases is perhaps a more

5

important interest in Mississippi than in any other state.

6

Mississippi is one of the few states that does not have an

7

intermediate Court of Appeals.

MR. ENNIS:

15

16

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ENNIS:

But in addition to not having an

But that again is routine, really.
Well, Your Honor, it may be routine, but

19

I do not think it is routine in most states for there to be the

20

backlog of appeals there is in Mississippi.

21

the average time in cases receiving plenary review between

22

appeal and disposition is about four years, as it was in this

23

case.

24
25

In Mississippi,

Mississippi wanted to address that chronic backlog
problem, and discourage appeals, but not prevent them.

k

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Now,

K

1

the Equal Protection Clause does not require a perfect fit

2

between means and objectives, but given the Legislature's

3

objectives in this case, there is actually a very close fit

4

between this statute and the desire to preserve judicial

5

resources.

6

The Legislature wanted a statute that would be as

7

self-executing and administratively simple as possible, so that

8

already overworked judges would not have to spend additional

9

time holding individualized hearings to determine whether there

10

should be a penalty, and if so, how much.

And the Legislature

11

wanted to provide an appropriate level of deterrence by

12

providing a penalty that would be proportional to the judgment

—

r
1

rn

1

at issue and which could be known in advance, so the

14

prospective Appellant would be able mathematically to calculate

15

the penalty and weigh the penalty when deciding whether the

16

strength of his or her appeal justified the penalty that would

17

be imposed if unsuccessful.

18

Given those objectives, it was certainly rational to

19

limit the appeal penalty to cases involving money judgments.

20

That, for example, explains why the penalty does not apply to

21

plaintiffs who seek money judgments but recover nothing.

22

Applying a penalty in that circumstance would require the

23

Mississippi Supreme Court to hold an individualized hearing and

24

make an ultimately subjective judgment.

18

appeal penalty statute, so there are now only three states that

classifications are not arbitrary and they are certainly not

20

proceed one step at a time, addressing broad social problems,

21

step by step.

22

In fact, in the very case that Bankers Life relies

23

upon, Lindsey v. Normet , this case upheld a statute that was

24

very under-inclusive.

for special litigation burdens that were not faced by any other

Excuse me.

It's Page 139(a).

10

There, the sole reference to excessive fine is contained in the

11

last sentence of the paragraph just before .4, which says:

12

"The punitive damage verdict was clearly excessive, no

reasonably related to any legitimate purpose, constitutes

Now, Your Honor, that reference to excessive fine is

their position on this case, this Court ruled eight to one that
in a case where a plaintiff repeatedly, at every stage of the
litigation, used the phrase "full faith and credit" but did not
say "the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal
Constitution," that was insufficient presentation in the state
courts .
Now, the Court in that case, the Georgia court, did
no even have a full faith and credit clause.

So in this Court,

in the Webb case, the plaintiff said, I must have been
referring, and it could only have been thought that I was
referring to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal
Constitution, because the Georgia Constitution doesn't even
have such a clause.
Even there, this Court said that was not adequate
presentation.
Let me just say that Mississippi does have an
Excessive Fines Clause.

Mr. Ennis, to get to the substance of some

of these questions, on the due process issue, would you think
that it would be a valid criminal statute to say that anyone
who commits a particular offense shall be subject to a fine in
whatever amount shall be determined by the jury that tries him?
Do you think that would violate due process of law?
MR. ENNIS:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that there

would be very serious problems under the Due Process Clause for
a truly criminal case, for that kind of an award.

I would like

to make two responses.
First, punitive damage awards are not criminal
sanctions.

And second, they are not unlimited.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

What are they limited by?
The common law restrictions that did

apply to amercements were applied.

They are applied as part of

the common law test for reviewing punitive damage awards and
were applied by the Mississippi Supreme Court.

Let me turn to

that.
The Appellant relies almost exclusively on the
Amercements Clause of Magna Carta and says it is very similar
to punitive damage awards.

It is in fact very dissimilar.

Amercements were monetary payments which were paid to
Crown, to the Government, not to private parties.

They were

not paid just for reprehensible or outrageous or intentional
conduct.

They were paid in almost every case.

I'm not interested in that for the moment.

I'm far away from

I just want to know why it wouldn't violate due

process to allow a fine of indeterminate amount.

You were

going to tell me that this was not an indeterminate amount.
Then we got lost somehow.
MR. ENNIS:

It's not an indeterminate amount, because

there are limitations on punitive damage awards, that they not
shock the conscience of the Court.
QUESTION:

That is a limitation, that it not shock

All right.

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Scalia, this test, the "shock the

conscience test," has been fleshed out more than that.

For

example, under the common law test for punitive damage awards,

the punitive damage award must bear some proportion to the

2

nature of the offense, not to the financial injury to the

3

plaintiff, but to the nature of the underlying offense.

4

must not be disproportionate to the nature of the conduct.
QUESTION:

MR. ENNIS:

9

Because it is not whether it's

10

disproportionate to the financial injury to the plaintiff, it

11

is whether it is disproportionate to the nature of the offense.

12

The nature of the offense in this case was a practice and

MR. ENNIS:

Well, let me try and answer that, Justice

Marshall.

There are two.

MR. ENNIS:

If the punitive damage award had been so

large as to in effect force Bankers Life out of business, that

would have violated the common law standards reviewing courts

apply in reviewing punitive damage awards.

10

That would be the

QUESTION:

11

So the tests are, not shock the judicial

12

conscience, not deprive of means of livelihood and thirdly, not

13

be excessive in relation to the offense, whatever that means.

14

MR. ENNIS:

Those are the principal tests used by the

15

common law.

Which brings us to the test that Appellant would

16

use, which is not those tests at all, it is not the tests used

17

at common law, but rather, proportionality to legislatively-

enacted criminal fines.

a punitive damage state where there would be a much greater

the claim it knew it should pay than it would in a penalty

The jury was entitled to conclude that this was a

corporate policy of Bankers Life in penalty states, to withhold

monies it knew it should pay, and that it had engaged in that

practice for a long time, because it had never changed its

QUESTION:

Would you agree that punitive damages are

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I would not personally

characterize them as quasi-criminal, but even if they were

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

quasi-criminal, that does not mean they are criminal-

In a lot

2

of cases, going back to 1851, Day v. Woodworth, this Court has

3

squarely ruled that even though punitive damage awards are in

4

part designed to punish and deter, they are not criminal, they

5

are civil sanctions.
The rationale that Bankers Life proposes would have

6

7

to apply, not just in punitive damage awards, but in the broad

8

range of civil fines and sanctions.

9

For example, treble damages in rico actions or in

10

anti-trust actions often exceed the maximum criminal fines

11

authorized for that conduct.
QUESTION:

12

Yes, but in a due process challenge, at

13

least those have been determined by legislative branches to be

14

appropriate and they would perhaps survive a due process

15

challenge, wouldn't you think?

16

MR. ENNIS:

Let me respond to that, Justice O'Connor.

17

If we really want to pay deference to legislative judgment, in

18

this case, we would win, because the Mississippi Legislature

19

has squarely rejected a bill that would have capped punitive

20

damage awards, even though the cap that they rejected would

21

have been 150 times higher than the maximum criminal fine.
QUESTION:

22

One legislative judgment, Mr. Ennis, one

23

legislative judgment that the Due Process Clause does not defer

24

to is the legislative judgment not to make a legislative

25

judgment.

And that is what you are talking about.

Heritage

43

No, Your Honor.

1

My position is simply this.

2

Bankers Life is arguing that the sole benchmark for determining

3

the excessiveness of an award ought to be the legislative

4

judgment of what is appropriate in the criminal context.

course, that ignores the fact that the fine in the criminal
