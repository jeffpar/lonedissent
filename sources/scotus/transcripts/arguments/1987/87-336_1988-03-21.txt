ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN G. KESTER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KESTER:

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents two questions of appealability of

9
10

collateral final decisions to the Courts of Appeals under

11

28 USC 1291 which is the basic statute that provides for appeal

12

from the district courts by right.

13

The suit is a civil action between two Belgians.

14

was filed by the Respondent, a Brussels stockbroker for 20

15

years against the Petitioner, who was a Brussels real estate

16

broker for 30 years.

District Court for the Central District of California and Los

18

Angeles.

It was brought in the United States

The Petitioner was arrested in Switzerland at the

20

request of the United States government while he was on a

business trip to Geneva.

country and Switzerland.

25

fraud.

He was then extradited to the United

The charges against him were mail

And he was tried and convicted in the Central District

of California on those charges, one count of each.

2

The issue in the criminal case centered around what

3

he knew, what his state of mind was during conversations that

4

he had with Respondent, most of which took place in Belgium or

5

Switzerland and that extended over a period of about three

6

years.

7

the criminal case, a three-day visit to Los Angeles during

8

which the Respondent gave him a check for a loan to a real

9

estate partnership.

10

And that also included, as a jurisdictional basis for

After the conviction, Petitioner was placed on

11

probation. As a part of a sentence of the criminal court, the

12

court ordered him to stay in the United States for the next

13

five years or until he made satisfactory provision for payment

14

of $34,000 as restitution of what the court held he owed to the

15

Respondent, plus some additional money to another Belgian.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Kester, is the Petitioner still in the

United States and still under the probation order?
MR. KESTER:

The probation order was modified

19

subseguently.

What happened was the judge said at first that

20

he had to stay in California.

21

could stay anyplace in the United States.

22

the judge later to modify the conditions of probation and the

23

judge said that if an adequate arrangement could be made to

24

provide security for the payment of all the amounts in the

25

criminal case, not the civil case, the judge would -- and if

It was then modified and said he

the government agreed that it was satisfactory, that he could

2

return to Belgium.

3

in the papers filed in this Court in the criminal case, he

4

entered such a contract, and the government agreed he could

5

return to Belgium.

And, earlier this year, this is spelled out

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KESTER:

8

QUESTION:

9

And that is where he is?
Yes.
On the first day that the Petitioner went,

at that time, he was required to be in California, as ordered

10

by the court to report to his probation officer in Los Angeles,

11

as soon as he arrived at the probation office, he was handed

12

the summons and complaint in this case.

13

of dollars in travel and punitive damages for alleged violation

16

It demanded millions

of the U.S. civil RICOH statute and for various California
laws .
The Respondent later explained that he waited until

17

after the trial to serve Petitioner and to quote Respondent:

18

"Because of case authority questioning the validity of serving

19

a defendant during a compelled appearance in a judicial

20

proceeding."

21

The Respondent claimed that handing the summons in

22

California in the probation office was what created

23

jurisdiction for the civil case based on personal service of

24

process within that state.

25

The Petitioner was allowed to appear specially in the

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

6
1

district court.

He moved to dismiss on several jurisdictional

2

grounds, two of which were the subject of the appeal.

3

first ground was that he could not be called to answer in a

4

civil suit that was based on personal service made on him while

5

he was compelled to be in this country because of extradition.

6

And he relied on U.S. extradition statutes, the extradition

7

treaty with Switzerland and this Court's decision in 1886 in

8

the United States v. Rauscher.

10

from being required to defend in a criminal court except

11

against the criminal charges for which he was extradited.
QUESTION:

12

13

Rauscher didn't involve appealability; did

it?

14

HR. KESTER:

Rauscher did not involve appealability.

15

It actually came up prior to final judgment on a certificate of

16

division between the two judges who were sitting in the Circuit

17

Court.

18

cases were appealable to the federal courts, if I'm not

19

mistaken.

In fact, I don't believe at that time the criminal

MR. KESTER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KESTER:

It didn't involve a civil case.
I beg your pardon?
It also did not involve a civil case.
That is right.

It was a criminal case.

24

And then after Rauscher, within three or four years, the

25

question came up in the lower courts of:

Heritage

What do you do with

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

1

the Rauscher principle when there is a civil case and it was

2

immediately held in the Southern District of New York in what

3

became the leading case on the subject, In Re Reinitz, that the

4

principle of Rauscher necessarily applied equally to a criminal

5

prosecution or a civil case.

6

this point.

7

otherwise.

8
9
10
11
12

And that has been the law up to

There is nothing ever until this case that held

QUESTION:

That held otherwise than there was

absolute immunity?
MR. KESTER:

That's right. Immunity from service of

process. Immunity from having to defend a civil case.
And just to complete the status of the proceedings in

13

the District Court, the other motion that was denied and that

14

Petitioner appealed from was a motion to dismiss for forum non

15

conveniens.

16

showing that the courts in Brussels were open as indeed the

17

Respondent conceded that most of the witnesses were Europeans,

18

most of the documents were in foreign language, that Belgian

19

business customs were involved and it didn't belong in a U.S.

20

court and that he was -- that the Petitioner was able at all

21

times to have been sued in Belgium if the Respondent had wanted

22

to sue him there.

And in support of that, he submitted affidavits

23

Basically, the argument was that Los Angeles was not

24

a convenient forum for a civil case for anybody except for the

25

Respondent to try to come under the U.S. treble damage and

Heritage

punitive damage provisions of the peculiar U.S. civil RICOH

2

law.

3

The District Court denied the motion without any

4

argument and without any opinion.

5

to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

6

Appeals did not consider his claim of immunity or his claim of

7

forum non conveniens, and instead it dismissed the case for

8

lack of jurisdiction.

9

The Petitioner then appealed
The Court of

The issue before this Court is whether a district

10

court order that denies an extradited person's claim of

11

immunity from civil process and denies a documented and

12

uncontroverted showing of forum non conveniens is an appealable

13

collateral final decision under the doctrine of Cohen v.

14

Beneficial Loan, Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, and

15

Mitchell v. Forsyth.

With your permission, I will address the first part

17

of my argument to the immunity claim and the second part to

19

submit, comes within the familiar three tests of Coopers &

20

Lybrand, Cohen and reiterated in many others.

21
22

QUESTION:

When you talk about immunity, are you

talking about freedom from service?

23

MR. KESTER:

24

QUESTION:

25

The forum non conveniens case, we will

That's correct.
Freedom of service because of the

particular circumstances surrounding his visit to this country.

1

You know, if tie came to this country at some other time, he

2

could have been served and there would have been no question.
MR. KESTER:

3

Absolutely.

What we are talking about,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, is a very limited narrowly statutorily and

5

treaty based kind of immunity that applies to a person who is

6

brought into this country through the engines of the

7

extradition process.

8

into the jurisdiction for that purpose, his presence here

9

cannot be used to serve him and cause him to come into court.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KESTER:

And that holds that when a person comes

How long does that run?
It runs, according to the treaty with

12

Switzerland, it runs basically for a month.

13

that have had less explicit treaties.

14

around forever.
QUESTION:

15
16

There are cases

He just can't hang

It isn't quite the same type of thing as

Mitchell v. Forsyth where the immunity was permanent.

17

MR. KESTER:

That is correct.

This immunity is not

18

something that would last all his life, although, as a

19

practical matter, perhaps it could.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. KESTER:

22
23
24
25

He wasn't going to come back, I suppose.
I would not have advised him to come

back.
QUESTION:

Is this like immunity from personal

jurisdiction -- is this like lack of personal jurisdiction?
MR. KESTER:

No, Justice Kennedy, this is not —

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

10

QUESTION:

1
2

You have to say that because lack of

personal jurisdiction is not appealable.
MR. KESTER:

3

Well, I don't think my answer surprised

4

you, but this is not the same thing as the ordinary 14th

5

Amendment due process immunity from lack of personal

6

jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the rule of

8

non-appealability be the same, though?

9

isn't it?

10

MR. KESTER:

It is very close;

No, I don't think it is because I think

11

really what you have in this case when we are talking about the

12

immunity is a Cohen v. Beneficial Loan but it is really a

13

Cohen-plus situation.

14

Cohen case and Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, but there is

15

something more.

16

You meet not only the three tests of the

I want to make it very clear what I am not arguing.

17

I am not arguing this afternoon to try to persuade you that

18

there ought to be an immediate appeal for every defendant who

19

would like to win his case on a pre-trial motion.

20

obviously, if that became the law, there would be nothing left

21

of 1291 and you would have piecemeal appeals all over.

22

that is true in the case of a 12(b)(2) ordinary personal

23

jurisdiction situation.

24
25

Because,

And

But ordinary personal jurisdiction as this Court said
in the Burger King case is not an exemption from having to

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11
1

stand trial.

2

judgment brought against you in a forum with which one did not

3

have adequate contacts.

4

It is a right not to have an enforceable binding

And it also, as a practice matter, it extends so

5

broadly on across the board that it would be a tremendous

6

inroad on the limitations on appeal --

7

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

How do we know that this is

8

any different?

Why is this something more than simply a right

9

not to have a judgment entered against you by reason of the

10

fact that you were here in this country by reason of compulsory

11

operation of the treaty?
MR. KESTER:

12

This is different, Justice Scalia, I

13

think first of all because it has always been recognized as

14

different.

15

immunity was first recognized.

16

-- the court not having jurisdiction to bring him to trial.

17

So, the court in Rauscher says that in this question that was

18

certified to it and afterwards, but more importantly --

It is described in the Rauscher case where the

QUESTION:

19

Well, you could say the same thing about

20

lack of personal jurisdiction.

21

to bring you to trial.
MR. KESTER:

22

It is described in terms of not

The court has no jurisdiction

Does it?
No, because in Rauscher, the court was

23

not talking about the 14th Amendment or due process or anything

24

like that.

25

statutes of the United States and the treaty under which the

The court was talking about the extradition

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12
1

person was extradited.

2

What I would submit to the Court, what you can see in

3

the cases is that the principle that allows an appeal in a

4

situation where there is a challenge to bringing person to

5

trial, is that you look at the source of the right.

6

to analyze what the right is that is being protected.

7

You have

Here you have a right protected by a specific federal

8

statute. There is a federal policy that says you cannot do

9

this.

It is enacted into law.

That was what this Court

10

decided in Rauscher and in the civil context in Reinitz, and I

11

submit correctly in Reinitz.
What you have is something very much like the

12

13

Mercantile Bank case which was decided under 1257 which we cite

14

in our briefs.

15

tougher row to hoe in that respect.

16

case is like Mercantile Bank v. Langdeau.

17

That was an appeal from a state court and a

QUESTION:

But, analytically, this

Analytically, it is like lack of personal

18

jurisdiction.

19

win this particular case:

20

as opposed to the right not to have a judgment entered against

21

you.

22

think they carry the day one way or the other.

23

I mean anybody can defined the rights so as to
the right not to be brought to trial

Those are just little nuances of expression.

MR. KESTER:

No.

I don't

I don't think they are nuances,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, with all respect.

25

a federal statute.

I think what you have is

The basis for Rauscher was a federal

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13
1

statute that --

2

QUESTION:

A federal statute that says:

You shall

3

not bring this guy to trial in a criminal case when he is here

4

under these circumstances.
MR. KESTER:

5

6

That is right.

That is right,

You

shall not bring this guy to trial.

7

QUESTION:

And you have personal jurisdiction

8

statutes and constitutional provisions that say it takes a

9

certain amount of contact in order to hail a guy into court.

10

Well, what is the difference?

11

MR. KESTER:

The difference, Mr. Chief Justice,

12

that the principle here is the same principle you had in

13

Mitchell v.

14
15

is

Forsyth.

QUESTION:

How does it differ from the personal

jurisdiction principle?

16

MR. KESTER:

Because in the personal jurisdiction

17

principle, you are talking about very broad general provisions

18

under the 14th Amendment having to do with personal contact.

19

And the right is the right that was talked about in the Burger

20

King case.

21

QUESTION:

No.

But how do you distinguish?

You say

22

it is a different right.

23

entered against you as opposed to not being brought to trial?

24

MR. KESTER:

25

QUESTION:

It is a right not to have a judgment

That's right.
I just don't think those are of really

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14
1

controlling significance.

2

MR. KESTER:

I think that you have to look at the

3

basis, as you are suggesting, the basis on which it is claimed

4

and say:

5

the policy of the very protection which he is invoking.

6

you conclude that the only way to vindicate the policy of the

7

legal provision, the statute or treaty on which he is relying

8

is to provide an appeal at that point —

Would bringing the person to trial seriously subvert

QUESTION:

9

But how about the policy that protects

10

someone from being hailed into court where there are

11

insufficient contacts?

12
13

MR. KESTER:

And if

It is not that strong a policy, I would

have to say.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KESTER:

How do you know?
I don't know.

All I can say on that is

16

to cite the Rauscher case, the Reinitz case and the specific

17

provisions.

18

not dealing here with just general provisions that apply to

19

everybody.

20

The difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that you are

This is a statute that is set up for particular —
QUESTION:

But why should that make it lean in your

21

favor, the fact that it is not a general provision that applies

22

to everybody?

23

shouldn't we extend it across the board?

24
25

If it is such a good idea, why don't we — why

We are only talking about people who are

present in this country as a result of extradition.

That is basically what this Court said in Rauscher.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kester, how broad is this rule of

specialty do you think?

under extradition and convicted as he was here and placed on

10

probation as he was here, and while on probation had an auto

11

accident and his negligence caused damage to somebody else, do

12

you think he is immune so to speak from suit for that auto

13

accident?

14
15

MR. KESTER:

Suppose that your client was here

No.

No, I don't.

And that is clear.

If he committed a crime while he was here —

16

QUESTION:

MR. KESTER:

Crime, a tort.

18

he would not be immune because there it is a subsequent

situation.

21

say, "Well, now, I have a free pass to go and commit torts."

22

No, we are not talking about that kind of thing at all.

25

It is not a subversion of the extradition process,

People cannot be extradited, come to this country, and

QUESTION:

Assuming he is convicted and sentenced to

prison, does that end his immunity?
MR. KESTER:

The immunity would end after he was

that your claimed immunity applies while he is still on

Now, this is really a frontal assault on the final

which is that it of course prevents repetitive piecemeal

appeals of what is in essence a single lawsuit. It allows

review after the case so that claims of error can be put in

their proper perspective to determine not only if they were in

22

fact erroneous, but if they were prejudicially so.

23

recognizes the critical role of the trial judge in our system,

rule helps to relieve the burden on the appellate courts.

And, finally and

And since 80 to 90 percent of our cases

8

Of course, there are exceptions to the final judgment

9

rule some of which come from Congress, such as Section 1292(b),

10

the Interlocutory Appeals Act, Section 1651 which is the

11

Extraordinary Writs Act providing for mandamus, Section

12

1292(a)(1), injunction cases, and this Court's Rule 54(b).

13

But, generally, the price we pay for the administration of

14

justice in our federal system in this country is that we await

15

the final judgment before we take our complaints about the way

16

the proceedings were conducted to the appellate court.

17

Now, in 1949, in the Cohen case, of course, this

18

Court carved out what it called a narrow exception to the

19

finality requirement to be applied in a small class of cases.

20

And that is the Cohen v. Industrial Beneficial case.

21

were three requirements set out by the Court in Cohen and

22

reiterated by Justice Stevens in his opinion in Coopers &

23

Lybrand just 10 years ago.

24
25

And there

appealable as a collateral order', it must first conclusively

determine the issue.

Secondly, it must involve an important

2

issue that is completely separate from the merits; and,

3

thirdly, the order must be effectively unreviewable after final

4

judgment.

5

Now, in the last decade or so since Coopers & Lybrand

6

this Court has grappled with the collateral order doctrine on a

7

number of occasions and has consistently said that it should be

8

applied with the utmost strictness and the exception should be

9

narrowly construed.

And, thus, cases such as Coopers & Lybrand

10

and Firestone, United States v. MacDonald, and Flanagan, and

11

Richardson-Merrell, in addition to Justice Powell's opinion in

12

Stringfellow and the opinion in Hollywood Motor Car Company of

13

all refuse to expand the collateral order doctrine.

14

read against the context of Abney, which involved double

jeopardy, and Mitchell and Nixon, which involved immunity,

16

rule that comes out of this whole series of cases is that as

17

far as item 3 of the Cohen formulation is concerned, namely,

18

effective unreviewability, what that really means is that what

is at stake in order to justify a collateral order appeal must

1

the second or the third test of the Cohen or Coopers & Lybrand

2

criteria.
In Gulf Oil v. Gilbert and Piper v. Reyno, this Court

3
4

set up the elements of a forum non conveniens termination,

5

particularly as regards the private factors to be considered.

6

The Court in weighing the forum non conveniens motion must look

7

at the access to sources of proof and the availability of

8

witnesses and must also make some practical determinations

9

about the problems associated with the case that might make the

10

trial easy, convenient, and expeditious.
Now, in a forum non conveniens setting, we suggest

11

?

12

that this kind of analysis, necessarily, requires the Court to

13

delve into the merits of the case.

14

that the issue of forum non conveniens is not completely

15

separate from the merits within the meaning of the Cohen

16

doctrine.

17

court based on speculation at the outset of a case as to

18

whether the forum will indeed be inconvenient and if

19

inconvenient, whether it will be prejudicially so.

20

And, therefore, we believe

It is in effect a discretionary ruling by the trial

And I guess it is not surprising that six of the

21

seven circuits that have ruled on the precise issue that is

22

before you today have held that forum non conveniens does not

23

meet the collateral order requirements because it is, among

24

other things, not completely separate from the merits.

25

Now, counsel has referred to the fact that there is

1
Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28

split in the circuits.

2

other way is the Fourth Circuit and it did so without any

3

elaboration of its reasoning, whatsoever, in a footnote to an

4

opinion after it had decided the merits.

5

said was, "We find that the Cohen criteria have been met."

6

The only circuit that has gone the

And all the court

The other circuits have engaged in a fairly elaborate

7

analysis of the issue and have determined not only, for the

8

most part, that forum non conveniens does not meet the second

9

criterion of Coopers and Cohen, but that it does not meet the

10

third, either.

11

Now, as regards the third Cohen element and forum non

12

conveniens, there really isn't any reason why this issue is not

13

reviewable at the end of the case like any other venue motion.

14

From his brief' and from his argument here today, I gather that

15

counsel's strongest point on that issue is that it doesn't very

16

often result in reversal after final judgment.

17

Well, this Court has been approached with that

18

argument before in Stringfellow and Firestone and

19

Richardson-Merrell, and has said, "That may well be, but that

20

is true of a lot of pre-trial orders and that goes more to the

21

difficulty of showing prejudicial error after final judgment

22

than to the guestion of whether the order ought to be

23

appealable before trial."

24
25

It also raises the question in my mind that if that
is true, is forum non conveniens objection that important?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

29

Because if it never results in reversal, how important can it

be?

3

in his brief, it is recognized that the Fifth Circuit very

4

recently in the Gonzales did, in fact, reverse a final judgment

5

based on forum non conveniens.

therefore, it fails the third Cohen element as well.

Most of the time when you are talking about a
