You may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY R. ETZWEILER, ESO.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. ETZWEILER:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court, we are here today asking this Court to overturn

9

a decision which threatens grave interference with state grand

10

jury proceedings.

It is our concern that the lower court's

11

opinion will encourage disgruntled subjects of state grand

12

jury investigations to file 1983 suits in the hopes that they

13

can sidetrack the state grand jury process or obtain discovery

14

under liberal civil discovery standards which are not available

15

in the criminal context.
I will briefly summarize the facts.

16

Petitioners in

17

this case are all state law enforcement officers who have been

18

sued in a 1983 action requesting both injunctive relief and

19

money damages.

20

issued by Judge Lenox, an assignment judge in New Jersey who

21

supervises the state grand jury.

22

The petitioners executed a search warrant

At the time of the execution of the search warrant

there was a dispute.

The plaintiffs claimed that the state

And the plaintiffs accordingly telephoned Judge Lenox

and 'obtained from Judge Lenox an order that all of the

2

evidence that was being taken should be sealed in evidence

3

boxes pending judicial resolution of the inventory problem.

4

Also at the time of the execution the state issued three

5

state grand jury subpoenas upon the plaintiffs, two of which

6

the plaintiffs complied with, and a third of which and also a

7

fourth subpoena which was issued later, the plaintiffs success­

8

fully moved to quash, again before Judge Lenox.

9

At a later date in an attempt to jesolve

the

Criminal Justice in Trenton, went through the evidence with a

12

court reporter to take an inventory, and in the process of

13

doing this came upon evidence which theplaintiffs

15

Amendment or attorney-client privileges or work product

16

privileges were being violated, and accordingly, in view of

17

their complaint, the state again resealed this evidence, not

18

the entirety of it but just three boxes of it pending judicial

19

resolution of this question which the state sought by an order

20

to show cause again before Judge Lenox compelling the plaintiff s

21

to explain why this resealed evidence should not foe unsealed.

The District Court in viewing these proceedings concluded that

2

with respect to the equity portion of the lawsuit, that is,

3

with respect to the plaintiff's claim for an injunction for

4

the return of property, that these proceedings showed that the

5

Younger abstention doctrine should apply, and accordingly the

6

District Court dismissed the equity portion.
With respect to the damages portion, the court

7

8

concluded that the pendency of the damages action would sub­

9

stantially impede the state's criminal investigation, and it

10

also dismissed this portion of the suit.

11

appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third

12

Circuit.

were not adequate to invoke the Younger absten­

With respect to the damages portion, the Third

19

Circuit concluded that even if the Younger abstention were

20

applicable, the District Court would have no discretion to

We submit that the Third Circuit erred —

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Etzweiler, some time in your

argument are you going to address your opponent's claim that
5

1

the case is moot?

2
3

MR. ETZWEILER:

I wasn't initially intending to, but

I will be happy to entertain questions on that question.

4

QUESTION:

5

questions.

6

brief, basically.

7

Well, I don't know that I have any

I was just — you are going to leave it to your

QUESTION:

Well, I have a question, if I may.

What

8

difference will it make whether we just dismiss the case or

9

in effect adopt Judge Adams' position in the Third Circuit?

10

MR. ETZWEILER:

11

QUESTION:

With respect to the damages claim?

Well, is basically what is at issue, wh&t

12

is your argument here is whether the damage claim should be

13

dismissed?

14

MR. ETZWEILER:

Well, we are arguing both that the

15

District Court has discretion to dismiss the damage claim

16

also that the District Court was correct with respect to the

17

Younger proceedings on the injunctive claim.

18

QUESTION:

and

Why do we have to fight about the

19

injunction now, when, as I understand it, they no longer seek

20

injunctive relief, and everybody agrees you can fight these

21

issues out in the state court?

22

MR. ETZWEILER:

They have agreed that they would

23

amend the complaint.

24

of the points is, there is currently allegations of criminal

25

conduct which has resulted in the issuing of state grand jury

They haven't yet done that.

Also, one

2

what I am trying to say is that this issue can come up again

3

before them.

12

But involving the same parties?
Involving the same parties, yes.

Let me see.
QUESTION:

7

8

I guess

Is there some likelihood that is going

to happen?
MR. ETZWEILER:

Well, that — I can't —

QUESTION: It can, but is it any more likely to
happen to them than it is to anybody else walking around?
MR. ETZWEILER:

There is an ongoing criminal

13

investigation going on.

14

course, am not at liberty to divulge what has happened in the

15

course of the state grand jury proceedings, but —

16

QUESTION:

Subpoenas have been issued.

I, of

You say they haven't dismissed their

complaint yet.

complaint when the proceedings are up here?

19

they could have done beyond saying to the appellate court, we

20

no longer have this claim?

21

Is it clear that they can dismiss their

MR. ETZWEILER:

Is there anything

What they have said is that if this

22

Court will dismiss the claim as moot, we will -- if this Court

23

will dismiss the petition as moot, we will amend the complaint

24

to delete our request for injunctive damages.

25

QUESTION:

What more could they have done?
7

Acme Reporting Company

Can you

and amend a complaint when the proceeding is on appeal?

2

you go into-1 the court of first instance and say, even though

3

this whole proceeding is under the jurisdiction of another

4

court, I want to amend my complaint?
MR. ETZWEILER:

5

Can

I don't know, Your Honor, but there

6

is another factor, and that is that not all the plaintiffs

7

have been indicted.

8

versy, for example, with respect to Mr. James, who hasn't, as

9

I understand it, agreed to dismiss this claim with prejudice.

10

The issue still remains in live contro­

He could come back later on the same claim.

11

Also, this type of question —

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ETZWEILER:

Mr. James is not a party.
Yes, he is, Your Honor,

He is one

14

of the respondents, and he is also a party who has not been

15

indicted.

Not all the plaintiffs have been indicted.

That is what —

MR. ETZWEILER:

I think they have agreed to amend

their complaint if this Court will dismiss the case as —

20

QUESTION:

Both the indicted and the unindicted.

21

MR. ETZWEILER:

I don't know if they have agreed

22

to do so dispositively on the merits and not come back into

23

court and petition —

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but they are all in the same

position, all of the respondents.
8

Acme Reporting Company

628-4888

MR. ETZWEILER:

1

Well, they are not quite all in the

2

same position in that only some of them have been indicted and

3

some have not.
QUESTION:

4
5

As regards their agreement with respect

to the injunction, they are all in the same boat.
MR. ETZWEILER:

6

They are not quite in the same boat

7

because the plaintiffs who have been indicted would of

8

necessity resolve their Fourth Amendment claims, I presume, in

9

the course of the state criminal litigation.

10

true with respect to the plaintiffs —

QUESTION:

11

That is not

Well, the respondents have also said

12

it is all right just to stay, that their damage suit be

13

stayed, haven't they?

14

MR. ETZWEILER:

15

QUESTION:

They have offered that, ves.

No injunction, and stay the damages suit

16

until the Fourth Amendment issue is settled in the state

17

court.
MR. ETZWEILER:

18
19

made, yes.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ETZWEILER:

22

25

That is the offer which they have

And isn't that the relief you seek?
No, we seek a reinsertion of the

District Court opinion. We don't want the damages action -QUESTION:

But the only difference is that you get

a dismissal of the damage claim, but it is not with prejudice.
MR. ETZWEILER:

That's correct.
Q

Acme Reporting Company

QUESTION:

1

So whether you stay it or you just,

2

you know, close the case and let them file it two years from

3

now, what difference does it make?

4

MR. ETZWEILER:

Well, the pendency of the damages

5

action has a chilling effect.

6

QUESTION:

Does it have any more chilling effect

7

than a letter to you saying, as soon as these proceedings are

8

over I am going to refile the case?
MR. ETZWEILER:

9

QUESTION: But that is all that we are asked.

MR. ETZWEILER:

Well, but these are very important

Psychologically it does.

We don't, you know, assuage people's feelings

MR. ETZWEILER:

Yes, I know, but this is an important

18

factor under the Younger comity considerations.

19

pendency of this action is going to, for example, make it hard

20

for our investigators to apply for credit when they apply for

21

mortgages and their mortgage companies get nervous.

as a sword over them that makes them less enthusiastic about

They would know that if they lose on

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

Can't they file the case again?

They

can file the case again if they win in the state proceeding,

10

and there is a holding that there was a violation of the

11

Fourth Amendment.

12

If

MR. ETZWEILER:

Yes.

Of course, it would be pre­

13

ferable if they would take all of these claims into the state

14

system where a single judge could --

15

QUESTION:

They are not required to do that.

16

MR. ETZWEILER:

17

QUESTION:

I agree.

And you are not asserting that.

They

18

have every right to file their 1983 damages claim in the

19

Federal District Court, don't they?

20

MR. ETZWEILER:

21

QUESTION:

Sure.

That's correct, Your Honor.
Now, what about if the statute

22

of limitations runs on them because it is dismissed?

23

that a consideration for the District Court to make in

24

determining whether to dismiss or not?

25

they should think about?

Isn't that something

11

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

Isn't

1

MR. ETZWEILER:

It very well may be.

It is not a

2

consideration which was brought to the attention of the

3

District Court in this instance.

4

QUESTION:

So long as the state' proceeding goes first

5

if New Jersey law allows it you xvill get the benefit of res

6

judicata from any favorable findings that the state court

7

makes on the Fourth Amendment issue.

8
9
10
11
12

MR. ETZWEILER:

I think that is probably correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: And that is true whether the federal
damages suit is stayed or dismissed, isn't it?
MR. ETZWEILER:

That's correct, but with respect to

13

the question of the stay or dismiss, another reason we think

14

that the District Court should have discretion in these

15

matters is that plaintiffs whose desire is to impede the grad

16

jury investigation are going to have an incentive to attach

17

damage claims to equity actions when they file 1983 lawsuits.

18

QUESTION:

But you are not arguing here, as I under­

19

stand it, and as I understand your response to Justice

How can

10

a federal judge say, I don't like these 1983 suits, I will

11

just dismiss it as a matter of discretion.

12

MR. ETZWEILER:

Well, he can do it under the comity

13

considerations which underlie the Younger abstention doctrine,

14

underlie, for example, this Court's opinion in Fair Assessment

15

versus McNulty on the theory that the pendency even of the

16

stayed damages action is going to have a chilling effect upon

17

these investigators as they attempt "to pursue the criminal

prosecution, and also for policy —

19

QUESTION:

It seems to me you have got oretty

20

timid investigators in New Jersey.

21

MR. ETZWEILER:

We also have in this case other

22

facets which supported the district court's discretion in

23

this matter, and that's the many questions of state law that

24

were very much intwined — intertwined with the federal claims.

25

For example, part of the federal claim here is that —

Going back to the -- with respect to the Third

10
11

Circuit's opinion again, which had covered not only the

12

damages action but also, of course, the request for injunc­

13

tive relief, it is our posture that the Third Circuit's

14

opinion will enable subjects of grand jury investigations to

15

chill investigations, to use discovery that they

16

obtain in the course of the criminal investigation, and also

17

will result in dual litigation, enmeshing both the federal

18

court and the state court in supervising the state grand

19

jury procedures which are contrary to our system of federalism

20

and the comity principles that lie at the basis of Younger.

deposition and for the production of documents.

Among the

documents which they wanted were documents which divulge what
the instructions our investigators had been given before they
went to execute the search warrant.

It is apparent that that

type of information could divulge or might divulge to the
plaintiffs the theorv of the state's case.
QUESTION:

Presumably you could get a protective

order from the Federal District Court if the District Court
is going to delay hearing the case in any event.
MR. ETZWEILER:

Yes, Your Honor, but of course the —

ascertaining whether the protective order is appropriate may
very well require the federal judge to look into the grand
jury investigation to ascertain what information should be
privileged, what information should not be privileged.

It

might require the federal judge to pull in the prosecutor, to
ask him what is happening in the course of this criminal
investigation.
Essentially it requires the federal judge or may
require the federal judge to supervise the grand jury process
just — or as the state judge should be doing.

We submit that

this is contrary to our notions of federalism.
QUESTION:

But again that would not happen if you

were to enter an order vacating the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and directing that in accordance with the representa­
tion of the opponents, the equitable claims all be dismissed

MR. ETZWEILER:

But the pending litigation will not

be hanging over these — the subjects of the investigation.

5

Also, if these plaintiffs, it would be preferable if these

6

plaintiffs would pursue all their claims in the state court

7

system where they have remedies, including 1983 remedies,

8

because in a coordinated system we can then have a state judge

We are prepared to support the majority of the Third Circuit.

I know.

There is a good argument that

it shouldn't have been dismissed, but there is an argument

I know, but the claim is that the entire

MR. FITZPATRICK:

14

I understand that, but it should

have been dismissed because of the alleged instrusion on the

investigative process by our seeking injunctive relief, not

QUESTION:

MR. FITZPATRICK:

And so we have an issue under Younger.
Well, you have an issue under

17

Younger, but what we say is essentially it is a moot issue

18

because the reason that Younger would be applicable, or the

reason it was argued that Younger was applicable to us below

is that we were seeking certain injunctive relief which we

are no longer seeking.

MR. FITZPATRICK:

would say where is the intrusion, where is the necessity —

where to comity principles come into play so as to deprive us

of what the Congress — deprived our clients of what the

repect to mootness, Justice, is that there is no longer any

validly before it based on comity principles and based on

5

federalism principles.

So that what we argue at this stage with

You are arguing the merits of an issue

that is before us now.

Is that the rule under Younger?

MR. FITZPATRICK:

Yes, we believe the rule under --

12

we believe that Younger allows, obviously, and mandates

13

abstention under certain circumstances, and what are the

14

circumstances?

15

17

It was essenitally a three-proncred test.

QUESTION:

Abstention on the damages claim or on

the injunctive claim?
MR. FITZPATRICK:

Well, we say that onlv on the

injunctive claim.

19

originally in the federal court there would be no basis for

MR. FITZPATRICK: Yes.

And does that really

it is in bad faith.

Younger the Court has looked at what facts should we look at
in determining whether or not Younger should apply.

For

instance, in Middlesex County, the belated effort by the New
Jersey Supreme Court to provide that petitioner a remedy for
his constitutional claims was considered even though that
didn't occur until after the Third Circuit's decision.
In the Hicks case there was an indictment that was
considered.

What we argue to this Court is, we are prepared

to analyze this case at any stage and argue to the Court that
there was never an ongoing state proceeding which was an

20

adequate forum for all of the relevant issues which we raised

21

in the District Court, and that is because there was never a

22

forum even today that would allow us to raise those constitu­

23

tional claims except for some of the constitutional claims

under the Fourth Amendment.

which you made.

If that were the only case, that is, our Fourth

This case was started before the state filed an ex parte order

if this Court were to look at where we were on December 27th,

1984, when this complaint was filed, there were no state

proceedings pending.

The state proceeding came, and I wrote

it down, but it is

13

They brought it, and then, of course, let'that order to show

cause sit there.

some time in February or March of 1985, by

15

We argue to you reason tells us that they did that

16

so that they could have created a proceeding that they could

17

go to the federal court and say, oh, look, there is a pro­

18

ceeding in New Jersey on some of these same matters, so you

19

ought to throw these plaintiffs out of the Federal District

20

Court because they, depsite the urging of Judge Lenox, for

21

over a year they did absolutely nothing with the order to

22

show cause.

23

when something happened we wrote to Judge Lenox, and Judge

24

Lenox said this case is deemed withdrawn because of this hiatus

25

and this inaction.

Nothing occurred.

It just sat there.

43

Acme Reporting Company

And then

So that while they were bound and determined to get

2

this order to show cause, certainly the state showed not so

3

great diligence on following up on the order to show cause,

4

although they obviously pointed to it at every stage in the

5

federal proceeding.
Finally, Justices, let me say that the Potomac case,

6
7

the Potomac Electric Company case, juxtaposed to our case, I

8

think amply demonstrates what the true differences are.

9

that case the plaintiff sought to have declared unconstitution­

In

10

al the underlying statutes with which they were threatened an

11

indictment, and they sought to have — essentially affect

12

the investigation by having the statute it was based on

13

declared unconstitutional.

14

not do that, and that is the difference, because if there was

15

an — if you consider the grand jury to be an ongoing state

16

proceeding, we would argue to the Court that it is not an

17

ongoing state judicial proceeding, and that there is no

18

certainty that Potomac Electric would have forgotten to argue

19

its case.

20

Not so here. In our case we did

Indeed, since there was no indictment, what we

21

argue indeed came true in Potomac Electric.

22

be able to argue the constitutionality of the ongoing statute

because there was no indictment, but in our case that is not

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ETZWEILER:

16

-

REBUTTAL

With respect to the mootness

17

question, and it is particularly with respect to the mootness

18

of the question whether state grand jury proceedings are

19

judicial proceedings for the purposes of the Younger absten-

20

tion doctrine, this is certainly a case which is capable of

21

repetition but evasive of review.
This Court has before it two cases, the PEPCO

22
23

versus Sachs case out of the Fourth Circuit, it has this

24

case out of the Third Circuit holding directly conflicting

25

theories.

In the PEPCO case the grand jury chose not to

Acme Reporting Company

3

return an indictment.

In this case the grand jury chose to

return an indictment.

It is very likely every time this

issue arises in the Third Circuit by the time it gets to this

4

Court, even in a very complex case as of this nature in which

5

the grand jury pleadings were extensive, one status or the

6

other is going to arise.
Therefore, it would be a basis of review -- evasive

7

8

of review.

It is certainly capable of repetition in this

9

case because there are grand jury proceedings outstanding with

10

respect to the plaintiffs because these plaintiffs may again

11

have a search warrant or other proceedings in the course of

12

those grand jury proceedings because these plaintiffs have

13

agreed to abandon their injunctive claim with respect to

14

this indictment but they haven't agreed to abandon these

15

claims with respect to any future criminal proceedings which

16

may ensue and which currently are under investigation.
Also, what we are reviewing here is the propriety

of the District Court opinion in which a dismissal■was
