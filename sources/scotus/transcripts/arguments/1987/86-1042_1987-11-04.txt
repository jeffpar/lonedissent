ORAL ARGUMENT BY HENRY B. FISCHER, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

MR. FISCHER:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case involves an ordinance of the City

of

10

Lakewood that gives the mayor contract authority to rent

11

the city's treeline property for the placement of news boxese

There are three issues that I would like to relate before

13

the Court today.

15

merits of the case, which was pointed out at Page 43 of the

16

brief, whether the discretion given by the ordinance to the

17

mayor and the architect review board are so uncontrolled as

18

to be unconstitutional, and the constitutionality of the

19

insurance requirement.

20

The three are jurisdiction, discretion, and

remedies and appeals, and did not properly test the ordinance

to assert the issues before the Court to permit passing on

24

the merits of the ordinance.

25

We will try to demonstrate that the discretion is

not uncontrolled, and that the insurance requirement, being

content neutral and otherwise reasonable, is constitutional.

MR. FISCHER:

The city

There wouldn't have

been any

discretion for the mayor to exercise if they had applied,

because there was nothing wrong with where they wanted to

MR. FISCHER:

That's right.

He was prepared to

issue the permit.

QUESTION:

12

MR. FISCHER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FISCHER:

Is that what the court below found?
Yes, starting with Finding 16.

What did he say?

What did it say?

It said that the city was ready,

15

willing, and able to issue the permits had they applied

16

but the Plain Dealer had not applied for the permits.

the ordinance?

Also,

What did it say about the breadth

of

What was the court's below view of the

MR. FISCHER:

Well, the District Court found the

ordinance to be constitutional all the way down the line.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

MR. FISCHER:

So they found — the District Court

24

obviously found that as to everything before it the mayor did

25

not have unbridled discretion, that the discretion was

appropriate.

2
3

QUESTION:

Yes, and then how about the — what did

it say about the mayor?

4

MR. FISCHER:

That the mayor did not have — they

5

found that the discretion of the mayor was not unbridled

6

and did not find anything wrong with it.

7

QUESTION:

But there was the provision, wasn't there,

8

that the mayor might deny or grant the application imposing

9

conditions deemed necessary and reasonable?

10

MR. FISCHER:

That's correct, that he would not —

11

he could not just deny it.

12

his

13

could deny it.

14

health and safety hazard caused by it.

15

that he could deny would be because it was not —- they could

not harmonize it through architectural review.

If he denied it, he had to state

Is that the limit of necessary and

19

MR. FISCHER:

Necessary and reasonable?

are talking about contract authority, and just like many

Other

legislative authority gives an individual authority to make

23

contracts within certain guidlines.

QUESTION:

So that is the

Well, the Court of Appeals thought :.that

the mayor was given too broad discretion.

8

9

They would want

MR. FISCHER:

That's correct, and our position

is that that is one of the things we are here to —

10

QUESTION:

So we have to disagree with them as

11

to the meaning of the ordinance?

12

MR. FISCHER:

If you get to that beyond the

13

jurisdiction, because we start with jurisdiction, and our

14

contention is and has been, because of the appeal procedure

15

that we have established, they should have applied for their

16

permit first, and if they didn't like the conditions, which

17

I submit to you I don't see any reason why they wouldn't have

18

1iked- them, I think they would have had their news boxes out

19

there since 1984, there would have been no problem.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Fischer, did you make a jurisdictional

21

argument in your jurisdictional statement, in your brief on

22

the merits?

23

MR. FISCHER:

Yes, you can find it at Page 31 §f

our brief

and essentially we cited the case of Greer versus

for testing.

We also asserted a defense in the District

Court that they had this administrative remedy and. that they

should have asserted it.

Yes.

Excuse me, it is 43.

The brief on the merits.

Is it

I'm sorry, Page 43 in our brief.'

■The ordinance was written, I can tell you from

8

firsthand because I wrote it, the ordinance was written so

9

that the City of Lakewood could permit them to place

their

10

news boxes without interfering with the constitutional

11

rights of other persons, e.g., Lovell, Schneider, other

12

people that would want to use that property but couldn't,

13

and the reason that they couldn't was because the Plain

14

Dealer wanted to use it exclusively.

15

theory to overcome that.

Yes?

with Greer versus Spock on Page 41 — or 42.

2

QUESTION:

I see.

3

MR. FISCHER:

So PD did not apply.

Instead, they

4

sued to attack the ordinances instead, and I think the

5

essence is that they want free, uninhabited use of the city

6

property.

That is where they are coming from.

7

So, as to jurisdiction, as I indicated, the city

8

had drafted this ordinance with the attempt to permit, not

9

to play games with the Plain Dealer.

We wrote this ordinance

10

so that the Plain Dealer could place their news boxes, and we

11

felt the appropriate theory for allowing this was a rental

12

theory.

13

And you could find in the finding 16 of the Court

14

and I think it is Page A30 of the jiirisdictional statements

15

where that finding is, that they would have been able to

16

get these news box locations, but instead they choose to

17

attack the whole thing.

18

The District Court would not receive any evidence

19

of administrative interpretation.

It is

if the ordinance is in fact setting

think the statement could even be made.

11

I hope I have answered your question on that.

12

QUESTION:

13

You are just disagreeing with the

District Court.

14

MR. FISCHER:

15

QUESTION:

16

You are just disagreeing with the

courts below.
MR. FISCHER:

17
18

Pardon?

I am disagreeing with the Court of

Appeals.

19

QUESTION:

On the construction of the ordinance.

20

MR. FSICHER:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. FISCHER:

Right, not the District Court.

Yes.
We have the provisions right in the

23

ordinance as to, you can't make it any different height, you

24

can't make it any different size, you can't put it next to a

25

fire plug.

All these things are spelled out.
10

Acme Reporting Company

The only thing

1

that is left for the mayor to do is to check to see if

2

architectural review was done, to be sure that it is a safe

3

location, and to put any other conditions — for example, the

4

condition to move the box in the case they have to do

5

construction*.

That is —

QUESTION:

We do have to disagree with the con­

struction of the ordinance with the Court of Appeals?

Yes, we do.

We also believe that —

they would grant them in the commercial districts, but not

lie in the residential district.

MR. FISCHER:

You said they said they

That's correct, and the Court of

Appeals sustained the City of Lakewood on that part ofthe

20

ordinance that they could limit them to the commercial

districts only.

They also sustained that the rental charge

MR. FISCHER:

7

You say there was nothing left for the mayor to do,

MR. FISCHER:

12

I think that these are terms of art.

I believe probably hundreds of contracts have come before

somebody to make a contract, they don't spell out every last

How do I know that?

Right.

It doesn't say technical conditions.

That could mean anything in the world, couldn't it?
MR. FISCHER:

I don't believe that it does.

I

17

think the intent of the legislature was clear that they wanted

18

the news box rental to go on, and it could be only the catch-

19

And there are no standards.

They had not at the time it was

20

QUESTION:

They admitted they didn't.

21

MR. FISCHER:

That's right, because there had been

nothing before them to work on so they had not proceeded to

that point.
