CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear arguments

4

first this afternoon in No. 86-595, United States against

5

Joseph Fausto.
Mr. Wright, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WRIGHT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
This case involves an excepted service employee who

11
12

misused a government vehicle.

At issue is 30 days back pay.

13

The Court of Appeals held that although the Civil Service

14

Reform Act does not provide for judicial review of adverse

15

actions like the one at issue, that Respondent had an implied

16

right of action in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act and

17

the Back Pay Act.
In our view, because the CSRA specifically deals with

18
19

the remedies available to federal employees, including this

20

employee in this situation, it precludes such an implied right

21

of action.

22
23
24
25

The CSRA draws three distinctions that need to be
kept in mind.

First, —

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, before you go on, am I correct

in my understanding that the CSRA did not provide for any

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

>

remedy for this basis of dismissal?

But it also did not

provide for this basis of dismissal?

That the basis of

2

3

dismissal was a basis outside the CSRA?
MR. WRIGHT:

4

Well, this employee was dismissed for

5

misconduct.

The CSRA deals with misconduct.

6

employees not to include this employee.
QUESTION:

7

It defines

Therefore, this employee's misconduct, or

8

the dismissal of this employee for misconduct is not the

9

dismissal of this employee under the CSRA.
MR. WRIGHT:

10

That's right.

Another way of looking

11

at that is that the CSRA hasn't provided him with any remedies.

12

That's our point.

13

The provision of the CSRA --

14

QUESTION:

Well, not only has it not provided him any

15

remedies, it also hasn't provided the government any basis for

16

dismissal.

17

MR. WRIGHT:

This is an excepted service employee for

L8

whom it is assumed that there need be no basis for dismissal.

19

This employee has no form of tenure.

20

service employee, and he is not a veteran.

21

QUESTION:

He is not a competitive

Then why was he dismissed for violation of

22

another statute outside of the Civil Service Reform Act.

23

wasn't he just told to be gone?

24

MR. WRIGHT:

25

He was given a list of reasons.

Why

He was

also allowed to file a grievance, but he was dismissed for use

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of a government vehicle.

2

federal employees may be dismissed for that.

3

that there is a mandatory 30-day suspension.

4

QUESTION:

A statute, a statute provides that

It also provides

It seems to me it's one thing to say that

5

where you have a comprehensive scheme like the Civil Service

6

Reform Act that provides for the basis of dismissal of a

7

particular employee, and does not provide any remedy, or

8

provides remedy only in certain instances and leaves out other

9

ones.
It's one thing to say that in that situation implicit

10
11

is that he has no remedy for the ones not listed, but it's

12

quite a different situation when the basis of dismissal itself

13

is not -- is not the CSRA, but rather, this other statute upon

14

which the government relied.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

That's true, but that other statute

16

gives him no remedies, and this statute is the comprehensive

17

statute covering adverse actions against federal employees.

18

If it simply neglected to deal with this employee,

19

that would be one thing.

20

shows that Congress dealt advertently with this class of

21

employee in this situation, and has provided, as we have

22

stated, that the Office of Personnel Management could provide

23

that he was covered and had the rights in Chapter 75.

24

hasn't.

25

But the whole scheme of the statute

It

In this situation where Congress dealt with him, gave

5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

him no rights at all under the comprehensive scheme that it set

2

up, and provided that OPM could decide to extend those rights

3

to him.

4

conclusion to draw is that Congress didn't want him to be able

5

to go to court to complain about a suspension for misuse of a

6

government vehicle unless OPM said that he could.

7

What we think that the proper result to draw, the

And OPM has said that some employees, excepted

8

service employees may go to court to do that, but it did not

9

grant that right to short-term employees like the Respondent

10

here.

11

And so under that scheme where Congress hasn't

12

forgotten about him at all, it is just like the Carducci

13

decision where Congress had provided no remedies in the case of

14

reassignments, but had dealt in great detail with all sorts of

15

adverse actions, and it was clear that it had deliberately

16

decided that federal employees can't go to court to complain

17

about reassignments.

18

QUESTION;

But the difference in Carducci was that

19

the basis for dismissal in Carducci was a basis set forth in

20

the Civil Service Reform Act itself, or the basis action taken

21

was a basis set forth in the Civil Service Reform Act,

22

unacceptable performance.

23
24
25

And as I understand it, that is not what's being
relied on here, any basis that's set forth in the act itself.
MR. WRIGHT:

No, that's right.

The government has

6
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

inherent authority to dismiss or suspend excepted service

2

employees because it — except to the extent that it has

3

granted them rights in the Civil Service Reform Act, which it

4

has in many case, I might add, but not this one.
QUESTION:

5

Let me ask you, Mr. Wright.

What is your

6

position in this court on the question whether prior to the

7

enactment of CSRA there would have been a remedy for this man?
MR. WRIGHT:

8

9
10
11

Well, we think that's a close question.

We think that the Testan decision is the one most closely on
point.

That was a classification decision.
QUESTION:

I know you argued it in the second go

12

around in the court below, and they said it was perfectly —

13

but I don't think see you are not arguing --

14

MR. WRIGHT:

15

QUESTION:

No, we are not pursing that.
So we start from the premise that prior to

16

CSRA he had a remedy, and that CSRA really impliedly took it

17

away from him.

18

MR. WRIGHT:

In 1963, the Court of Claims held in the

19

Greenway decision that a probationary excepted service employee

20

could go to court in certain situations.

21

has described that as giving him a right to challenge an

22

arbitrary dismissal.

23

And the court below

And, no, we're not — I thought you were asking the

24

question sort of in the abstract whether Greenway was correctly

25

decided under the law at that time.

We think that's a close

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

question, but is no longer relevant after enactment of the CSRA

2

which we think precludes this cause of action.
QUESTION:

3
4

I gather your principal reliance is that

this is a very comprehensive scheme.

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

10

inherent authority?
MR. WRIGHT:

11

Yes.
And yet, you say while it doesn't in terms

Not in this case.
Not in this case.

Nevertheless there's

To fire excepted service employees.

12

This employee is not a competitive service employee.

13

majority of federal employees are in the competitive service.
QUESTION:

14

The vast

Well, I don't understand why -- why

15

doesn't the comprehensive statute preempt this so-called

16

inherent authority?
MR. WRIGHT:

17

Well, the comprehensive statute gives

18

this person no rights in this situation.

19

specific statute dealing with misuse of government vehicles,

20

and that was what was — this employee committed five breaches,

21

but it was the misuse of the government vehicle that was

22

ultimately the basis for the adverse action here.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

There is a very

And what's the source of this inherent

authority?
MR. WRIGHT:

We quoted a number of cases in our

8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

brief.

It has long been assumed that excepted employees,

2

employees who are excepted from the competitive service serve

3

at will and have no property interest in their jobs, and may be

4

terminated without any process at all.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WRIGHT:

7

Competitive service employees are, of course, much

8

different.

9

of rights.

And assumed.
And a number of courts have so held.

Competitive service employees have long held a host

In enacting the CSRA, Congress complained to some

10

11

extent that it was assumed by many people that it was

12

impossible to fire a federal employee because they had so many

13

rights.

14

employees there.

15

rights anything like the rights granted to competitive service

16

employees.

17

But Congress was thinking of competitive service
Excepted service employees have never had

QUESTION:

If you are right here, then the government

18

didn't need to rely on a statute that provided for a 30-day

19

suspension if you misused a car.

20
21
22

MR. WRIGHT:

It just could have fired him.

Yes, it could have, and I think that's

undisputed.
QUESTION:

Well, is it the same thing to be fired for

23

no reason at all as to be fired for stealing a car, or for

24

misusing a car?

25

Wouldn't he have some constitutional right to a

9
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

name-clearing hearing if he is fired for that sort of a reason

2

anyway?
MR. WRIGHT:

3

He certainly never argued that he had

4

any sort of liberty interest here.

5

circumstances, he might.

6

he would.

I suppose in some

I don't think in the normal instance

7

QUESTION:

I don't think so.

8

QUESTION:

Doesn't his claim rest on some kind of

9
10

regulation?

I'm a little fuzzy on the facts?

MR. WRIGHT:

Didn't he --

The Department of the Interior allowed

11

him to file a grievance.

12

situations employees could challenge employment decisions by

13

filing a grievance.

14

It provided that in a whole host of

OPM, in 1980, set forth some regulations which

15

basically require agencies to set up grievance procedures, and

16

it has also provided that except for those excepted service

17

employees who hold policy making decisions, that those

18

grievance procedures should generally be available to other

19

excepted service personnel so that they can file grievances.

20

QUESTION:

And your position, as I understand, is

21

even if they just go ahead and violate those regulations, don't

22

give him a hearing, don't do what the regulation provide, there

23

is just still no provision for any judicial review.

24

MR. WRIGHT:

25

QUESTION:

That is basically our argument.
If you had a regulation that when there is

10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a lot of snow in Washington, everybody can go home at 3:00 and

2

still get a full day's pay, and the excepted service people,

3

they just didn't pay them, they would have no remedy.

4

MR. WRIGHT:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, that's not an adverse action.
That's not paying them?
No.

By adverse action, we're talking

7

about dismissals, suspensions, demotions.

8

may cover failures --

9

QUESTION:

In some cases, it

Then they demoted him for not showing up

10

on a day he was told he could go home, because the regulation

11

says you don't have to work past 3:00.

He didn't and the boss

12

says, I don't like that; you're fired.

There would be review

13

of that with an excepted service employee.

14
15

MR. WRIGHT:

And excepted service employee who wasn't

a veteran, we don't think there would be review there.

16

Now we have held open the possibility --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Even if there was a flagrant violation of

a regulation.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, we have held open the possibility

20

not presented here that in an appropriate case mandamus might

21

be warranted —

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WRIGHT:

24
25

Well.
-- if an agency just flatly refuses to

follow its regulation.
QUESTION:

Your response is that that's okay, that

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

anyway they should have just fired him for no reason at all

2

instead of for not coming in on a day when he didn't have to

3

come in.

4

MR. WRIGHT:

No, no, but that's not our response, and

5

an agency certainly should follow the regulations.

6

think that in the vast majority of cases they do.

7

And we

But in cases involving relatively small group of

8

federal employees which includes only nonveterans in the

9

excepted service, I might add veterans, also known as

10

preference eligibles, have basically the same rights that

11

competitive service employees do.

12

excepted service do serve at will, and except possibly for a

13

mandamus action, no, they can't complain about adverse actions.

14
15

But that nonveterans in the

Congress, in our view, quite clearly intended that
they not be able to go to court to do this.

16

I might add —

17

QUESTION:

— he said, if he were a competitive

18

service employee and was charged with this offense, no adverse

19

action against him as a competitive service employee except

20

pursuant to Chapter 75 with all its procedural guarantees; is

21

that right?

22

23

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, if he were a competitive service

employee, he would have all sorts of rights.

24

QUESTION:

He'd have all kinds of hearings and all

25

the rest of it, wouldn't he?

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. WRIGHT:

1
2

Ultimately go to the Merit Systems

Protection Board.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WRIGHT:

5

Here he gets to file a grievance, which he did, and

6

which he was awarded seven months back pay as a result of the

7

grievance.

10

back pay, and be able to go to court and claim 30 days more
back pay.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WRIGHT:

13

QUESTION:

14

And from there to the federal circuit.

The question is whether he should get 30 days more

8

9

But here he gets nothing.

What lets him file a grievance?
The Interior regulation.
And that could have been disregarded also

and there would have been no relief except for mandamus.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

That's right.

16

We recognize that that hypothetical -- we don't think

17

it's very likely.

18

case like that where an employee would have no right to relief

19

under our view, he probably could file a mandamus action.

We recognize that hypothetical.

And in a

This comes up in the classification cases following

20

21

enactment of the CSRA, I might add, and it is -- the courts

22

have divided on this, but some courts have held that you can't

23

even file a mandamus action because you can go to the special

24

counsel.

25

Now it is open to this employee to go to the special

13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

counsel of the MSPB if he alleged that he had been subject to

2

what's know as a prohibited personnel practice, which are 11

3

particularly troublesome practices like nepotism.

4

specifically deals with excepted service personnel, and

5

provides that except for policy making excepted service

6

personnel you can go to the special counsel to complain about a

7

prohibited personnel practice.

8

9

This Respondent does not allege that he was subjected
to a prohibited personnel practice.
QUESTION:

10
11

The act

So that —

Was he a long -- a long-time employee of

the government, or a temporary employee, or what?

12

MR. WRIGHT:

He was a temporary employee.

He had

13

worked I think for the FDA.

14

Interior Department.

15

took it acknowledging -- it's a very brief three-paragraph

16

acknowledgement that's in the record that says,

17

that I'm becoming an excepted service employee, and I have no

18

rights to any future job after this.

19

took the job.

20

He took a position with the

He signed a piece of paper at the time he

I understand

And that's the way he

Also as a condition, which is on the form he filled

21

out when he took the job is that he understood that he would

22

serve until the Young Adult Conservation Corps Camp at which he

23

worked closed, or until a certain date in 1980, whichever was

24

earlier, and that was about a year and a half after he was

25

hired.

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

So he was hired as a short-term employee.

1

His

2

position was placed in what's known as Schedule A in the

3

regulations that list all the excepted service positions,

4

because it was a short-term position.

5

QUESTION:

May I ask you one other question?

6

This case just deals with this class of employees who

7

are nonveteran excepted service employees, or it will,

8

basically patronage or at will -- I don't know.

9
10

But in any event, how big a segment of the federal
work force is it?
MR. WRIGHT:

11
12

service includes --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WRIGHT:

It's about 20 percent.

The excepted

That's a lot of people then, isn't it?
There are quite a few.

It includes

15

certain employees whose agencies are removed from the

16

competitive service.

17

Defense Intelligence Agency.

18

I'm told.

19

QUESTION:

20

Branch, doesn't it?

That includes such things as the CIA, the
It includes the Judicial Branch,

It includes all lawyers in the Executive

21

MR. WRIGHT:

22

Schedule A, the regulations list about 60 groups.

23
24
25

That's right.

That's Schedule A.

There are policy making employees were all in Schedule C.
QUESTION:

If it includes all lawyers, you must have

a conflict of interest.

15
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. WRIGHT:

Justice Stevens, the Office of Legal

3

Counsel has considered that question, and has decided that it's

4

unlikely I'll be subjected to an adverse action so I --

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Schedule B, working backwards,

includes

7

a lot of student positions.

There are lots of student

8

positions in the federal government.

9

many short-term jobs, and a variety of other jobs that are in

And Schedule A includes

10

some ways difficult to categorize:

chaplains, attorneys,

11

Japanese interpreters, employees of federal mental institutions

12

who were previously patients at the institutions, et cetera.
But short-term employees actually are,

13

I'm told, more

14

than half of the employees in the excepted service and Schedule

15

A, and policy making employees are all of Schedule C.
I would like to point out one distinction that I

16
17

haven't made that I think is very important, is the distinction

18

between Chapter 43 of the Civil Service Reform Act, and Chapter

19

75.

20

Chapter 43 governs adverse actions based on

21

unacceptable job performance.

22

adverse actions based on misconduct.

23

Whereas, Chapter 75 governs

It's undisputed that if this employee had been

24

dismissed for unacceptable job performance under Chapter 43,

25

that he would have no right to challenge that action.

16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Chapter

1

43 is parallel to Chapter 75 in many ways.

It explicitly deals

2

with each of the classes of federal employees.

3

that chapter that excepted service nonveterans have certain

4

procedural rights.

5

competitive service employees and veterans, those with

6

preference eligibility, can go to the MSPB and then to the

7

federal circuit.

It says under

But it also explicitly states that only

8

The D.C. Circuit recently decided in the Harrison

9

case, a case that no one disputes, that an excepted service

10

employee dismissed for unacceptable behavior -- unacceptable

11

job performance, excuse me — has no right to go to court to

12

complain about it.
We think that Congress intended the same in Chapter

13
14

75.

15

to list certain excepted service positions as having rights,

16

including the right to judicial review.

17

The difference is that in Chapter 75 it has authorized OPM

So to some extent, excepted service employees have

18

greater rights under Chapter 75 in misconduct cases.

19

if OPM decides that they have those rights.

20

included this group, Respondent's group of excepted service

21

employees within the -- it has not given them the rights in

22

Chapter 75.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

They do

But OPM hasn't

Is it that the Respondent's group can only

use mandamus?
MR. WRIGHT:

They can file grievance procedures and

17
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

it's not presented here, but one would think that in an

2

appropriate case mandamus might be warranted.
They could also go to the special counsel of the

3
4

MSPB.

5

QUESTION:

6

mandamus that's been granted?

7
8

MR. WRIGHT:

-- in mandamus, do you know of any one

We cited one in our brief in a

classification case.
QUESTION:

9

MR. WRIGHT:

10

Any more?
Well, if that isn't the case, it must be

11

because agencies are following their regulations.

12

surprised if there were many cases involving federal agencies

13

where mandamus was granted.
QUESTION:

14

I would be

Is it not true, you say that he would have

15

these procedural rights if he had been included by -- who puts

16

him in there?

17

MR. WRIGHT:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WRIGHT:

20

OPM.
By OPM with Chapter 75.
OPM in Chapter 75.11(c).

It's as clear

QUESTION:

22

MR. WRIGHT:

23

QUESTION:

All right.
— that OPM can do this.
But isn't it true that OPM has to

24

affirmatively include him not only in order that he have those

25

remedies, but in order that he be included within that chapter

Heritage Reporting Corporation

at all?

So the chapter simply doesn't apply to him unless 0PM

2

says so, including the dismissal provisions and the adverse

3

actions provisions of the chapter.

4

for purposes of that chapter.
MR. WRIGHT:

5

He just is not an employee

I think all that chapter does is grant

6

rights.

I don't know that it does much else.

But I suppose it

7

says that you can only be fired for cause, but that's a right.

8

So he is granted no rights under the chapter, because the

9

relevant definitional provision, which is 75.11(a) says that

10

for the purpose of this subchapter employee means an individual

12

period.
QUESTION:

13
14

This is Section

7503, cause and procedure.
MR. WRIGHT:

15
16

Well, now wait a minute.

That's for minor adverse actions.

That's not the relevant one here.
QUESTION:

17

It's the --

Well, whatever.

It says under regulations

18

prescribed by 0PM, an employee may be suspended for 14 days or

19

less for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the

20

service.

21

right to be fired or suspended?

22
23
24
25

I don't consider that the granting of a right, the

It seems to me that that's the authority for the
agency to do the suspension, no?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, that's the short-term -- I assume

you would make an analogous argument under 75.12.

QUESTION:

Right, right.

I just happen to see 3

authority for disciplinary action, isn't it?

4

But 75 not only gives rights,

MR. WRIGHT:

Well,

it also is a source of

in the case of an excepted service

employee, you don't need any authority.

6

here, then it would give him a right only to be suspended under

7

regulations that will promote the efficiency of the service.

10

So if you were covered

In the absence of that, he doesn't even have that
right.
QUESTION:

I'm puzzled.

I thought they define the

11

term "employee" in Chapter 75, it would just be from the

12

competitive service.

13

MR. WRIGHT:

75.11(a) says employee means an

14

individual in the competitive service who is not serving a

15

probationary or trial period.

16
17

(b) says a preference eligible in an executive agency
in the excepted service —

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WRIGHT:

Oh,

I see.

That's in 75.11.

And then part (c) — which is the

20

subsection governing major adverse actions, suspensions for

21

more than 14 days or dismissals.

22

And (c) says, the Office of Personnel Management may

23

provide for the application of this subchapter to any position

24

or group of positions excepted from the competitive service.

25

So it is true that this employee isn't in this

20
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

chapter, but that's because OPM hasn't chosen to put him there.

2

And in the absence of OPM putting him there, he has no rights

3

in a case of this sort.
It seems strange that he would have more rights under

4
5

Chapter 75 because he's out completely than under Chapter 43

6

where he is in to the extent that he gets certain procedural

7

rights which are quite analogous to the grievance rights that

8

OPM has granted excepted service employees under Chapter 75

9

and -QUESTION:

10

11

When you use the term Chapter 75, you

really mean Subchapter 2 of Chapter 75.

12

MR. WRIGHT:

13

QUESTION:

14

that same definition.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

That's the major adverse action part.
Because in Subchapter 1 they don't have

No.

Subchapter 1 is minor adverse

16

actions.

17

Subchapter 1, and it has been argued in a number of cases,

18

analogous to the argument here, that because minor adverse

19

actions aren't covered there, that that employees, they are not

20

excluded in any way; that employees can go to court under the

21

Tucker Act to complain about minor adverse actions just as they

22

can't — we argue analogously that they can't here.

23

No one gets a right to judicial review under

One last point I'd like to make is that besides being

24

undisputed that under Chapter 43 employees cannot go to court,

25

it is undisputed that probationary employees who are excluded

21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

from Chapter 75, in the same sentence that I just read of

2

75.11(a), cannot complain about adverse actions either.

3

that's even though the Greenway decision, which is the basis

4

for the implied cause of action here, held that a probationary

5

excepted service employee was entitled to go to the old Court

6

of Claims.

7

And

We don't think any distinction can be drawn between

8

probationary and excepted service employees in the way they are

9

treated in Chapter 75, and we think it's plain, as we state in

10

our briefs, that Congress didn't want to make a federal case

11

out of adverse actions taken against these sorts of employees.
If there are no questions, I would like to reserve

12

13

the remainder of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Wright.

15

Mr. Nannes, we will hear now from you.

16

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN M. NANNES

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NANNES:

18
19

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

20

The judgment of the Court of Appeals below rests upon

21

three propositions, all of which are important and two of which

22

the government does not contest.

23

First, Mr. Fausto was discharged in violation of

24

agency regulations.

25

provided that a career-type, nonpreference excepted service

The Department of Interior regulations

22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

employee who was discharged had a right to receive notice in a

2

discharge decision of his right to pursue the agency grievance

3

mechanism.

4

And the regulations of the Department of interior

5

further provide for the small universe of employees that they

6

had a right to a full evidentiary hearing if they were being

7

discharged for cause.

8
9

It is undisputed that Mr. Fausto was not provided
these rights at the time that he was discharged, and I do not

10

understand the government to contest that the agency fulfilled

11

its obligation under the regulations.
Thus, this case comes to the court with the

12

13

concession by the government that the agency violated its

14

regulations.

15

Second, Mr. Fausto would have been entitled to

16

judicial review if he had been discharged prior to passage of

17

the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

18

in its reply brief, and it has made the point once more here

19

today that that is somehow an implied right or a judicially

20

implied right.

21

decisions of this court and of the old Court of Claims support

22

the proposition that that was a statutory right of judicial

23

review.

24
25

The government endeavors

But I would submit to the court that prior

a cause of action when there has been a violation of an agency

regulation,

2

money mandating remedy, and the violation by the agency in this

3

instance of his procedural regulations, provided Mr. Fausto

4

with a statutory cause of action.

5

in conjunction with the Back Pay Act, which is a

The Greenway decision, which happens to be one of the

6

cases that the court below cited, is by no means the only case

7

holdings in that manner.

8

looks in the aftermath of its decision almost 30 years ago in

9

Vitarelli v. Seaton, it will find that the employee who was

Indeed, if the court goes back and

10

there wrongfully discharged was then reinstated by his agency.

11

He contended that the back pay that the agency had awarded him

12

was insufficient, and he filed a cause of action in the old

13

Court of Claims, and that cause of action was sustairted.

14

very much a statutory cause of action, and it preceded the

15

enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act.

16

It is

Third, the Court of Appeals below found that there

17

was no evidence that Congress intended when it enacted the

18

Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, to repeal rights of judicial

19

review that previously would have been available to employees

20

such as Mr. Fausto.

21

This is certainly a proposition that the government

22

does contest, and thus, the issue presented for this court is

23

whether it is fairly discernable that when Congress enacted the

24

Civil Service Reform Act, that it intended to extinguish or

25

repeal statutory right that otherwise would have continued to

24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

be available to nonpreference excepted service employees such

2

as Mr. Fausto.

3

Notably, Your Honors, the government does not rely

4

upon any specific preclusion language in the Civil Service

5

Reform Act itself.

6

Chapter 75 or elsewhere, that specifies that prior remedies

7

that had been available to other types of employees were

8

intended to be extinguished by the Congress.

9

There is indeed no provision in that act,

Thus, under the holding of this court almost 30 years

10

ago in Vitarelli v. Seaton, Mr. Fausto has a right of judicial

11

review to obtain review of his discharge in violation of agency

12

regulations.

13

The government seeks to distinguish Vitarelli on the

14

proposition that Congress had not specifically indicated with

15

respect to the statute there involved an intention to preclude

16

judicial review.

17

statute pursuant to which Mr. Vitarelli was discharged provided

18

the Secretary of Interior with a right to discharge him that

19

would be "final and conclusive" in the language of the statute.

20

And there is certainly nothing of an analogous preclusionary

21

sort in the Civil Service Reform Act.

22

right of judicial review was upheld.

23

But I would note for the court that the

And yet, in Vitarelli a

Instead, the government relies upon broad arguments

24

drawn from a so-called statutory scheme.

25

that in other provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, such

It is certainly true

25
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

as Chapter 23, which deals with prohibitive personnel

2

practices, and Chapter 43, that deals with performance

3

appraisal standards, that various rights are accorded to

4

nonpreference excepted service employees.

5

But the inclusion of references to those employees in

6

Chapter 23 and Chapter 43 simply provide no guidance to the

7

court as to what the congressional intention was underlying

8

enactment of Chapter 75.

9

ignores the legislative history underlying that chapter, but it

It is notable that the government

10

nevertheless tries to draw broad conclusions based on the

11

statutory scheme.

12

The legislative history demonstrates quite

13

conclusively that when Congress enacted Chapter 75 it had a far

14

more limited objective in mind.

15

Chapter 75 was to transfer the adjudicatory jurisdiction over

16

employee appeals that had formerly resided in the old Civil

17

Service Commission, and instead, to transfer that to the new

18

agency, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and that Congress

19

also intended thereby to consolidate judicial review of such

20

decision in what has now become the Federal Circuit, rather

21

than to permit actions to be initiated in district courts

22

throughout the country under the Administrative Procedure Act.

23

Part of the purpose underlying

There is simply no indication in the legislative

24

history underlying Chapter 75 that Congress was intending

25

thereby to change the rules that had previously been available

26
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

to nonpreference excepted service employees.

2

What Congress did —

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. NANNES:

5

QUESTION:

6

What about to other employees?

Would other employees continue to have

their pre-existing rights to get into federal court --

7

MR. NANNES:

8

QUESTION:

9

I'm sorry?

No, Your Honor.
-- apart from the scheme set forth in

Chapter 75 of getting there after going through the MSPB?

10

MR. NANNES:

No, Your Honor.

11

We would take the position that with respect to

12

emplpyees who are defined as covered by Chapter 75, that the

13

Chapter 75 rights do provide an exclusive enumeration of the

14

rights to which they are entitled.

15

So that,

for example, in the numerous Courts of

16

Appeal cases where employees who are covered by Chapter 75 have

17

endeavored to assert rights either as an implied cause of

18

action or under the Administrative Procedure Act, those rights

19

have -- those efforts have been rebuffed and rejected.

20

QUESTION:

Isn't there a certain irony there then

21

that the people not covered by Chapter 75 can go directly to

22

court, whereas those who are covered have to work their way up

23

through the administrative procedure?

24
25

MR. NANNES:

Your Honor,

I think there certainly

would be if that were the fact applicable to Mr. Fausto, and

27
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the government endeavors to characterize Mr. Fausto's rights as

2

I think more powerful engines of enforcement, for example, than

3

are available to competitive service employees.

4

In point of fact, a nonpreference excepted service

5

employee such as Mr. Fausto was required to exhaust his

6

administrative grievance system.

7

three-tier system of administrative review, and it took him

8

from January 1981 until February 1985 to get a full

9

determination of --

10

QUESTION:

11
12

In this case, that was a

What was the source of the authority

requiring him to exhaust the administrative remedies?
MR. NANNES:

Your Honor, I don't believe that there

13

was a specific exhaustion requirement.

14

doctrine of primary jurisdiction, or some analogue, had he gone

15

right from his discharge decision into the Claims Court, the

16

Claims Court either would have dismissed or would have stayed

17

and required him to exhaust.

18

But I think either as a

But the notable feature here, I would suggest to the

19

court, is that an employee who is defined within the coverage

20

of Chapter 75 is not required, and indeed is prohibited from

21

pursuing the agency grievance system.

22

QUESTION:

Unless the agency establishes a grievance

23

system for this category of employee, which it is under no

24

obligation to do, the situation would be that he could go

25

directly to federal court, whereas those employees of a

28

Your Honor, I think there are two

QUESTION:

And indeed, in some cases would not even

5

be able to go to the MSPB; would have no relief, depending upon

6

what the level of the sanction was, except asking the counsel

7

to consider their grievance, whereas he would be able to go

8

federal court no matter what.

9

MR. NANNES:

Your Honor, in the first instance, the

10

Office of Personnel Management has promulgated regulations that

11

do require all agencies to promulgate and adopt an agency

12

grievance mechanism.

13

QUESTION:

Well, that's a fortunate happenstance, but

14

that doesn't speak to the rationality of the legislative scheme

15

that does not require such a regulation to be issued.

16

fact is that in the absence of such regulation, he would come

17

directly to federal court, whereas the more protected employees

18

would have to go through the MSPB, and in some cases wouldn't

19

even have that available.

20

Counsel with a discretionary authority on his part to press

21

their grievance.

22

MR. NANNES:

And the

They would have to go to the General

If an employee such as Mr. Fausto were

23

to endeavor to do so, he would be met I think with a more

24

formidable problem, because he would have no agency regulation

25

that had been violated to predicate his claim under the Tucker

29
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Act.

2

It's only the agency's disregard of its grievance

3

right and its right to a hearing that is conferred upon Mr.

4

Fausto that provide the regulation basis for his Tucker Act

5

claim.

6

So it may be true that he would have an opportunity

7

to file his complaint, but it's unlikely to be one that would

8

be of substantive import.

9

QUESTION:

Well, that's the case with his particular

10

grievance, but you can have another grievance that doesn't

11

consist of the lack of a promised hearing.

12

MR. NANNES:

QUESTION:

15

Well, to the extent, Your Honor -Something else that went wrong in the

adverse action.
MR. NANNES:

Well, I think there might be some

difficulty if an employee were endeavoring to try to get a

court to review the merits of the claim.

confining the argument to a situation where an employee was

19

denied procedural rights to which he was entitled under the

20

grievance system.

QUESTION:

So we are simply

But do you agree that absent some

22

regulation giving a person in the excepted service some both

MR. NANNES:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So the statute at least in some respects

does deal with the excepted service -MR. NANNES:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and I would

concede that.

17

The difficulty that the government has, though, with

18

extrapolating from that proposition to the conclusion it tries

19

to reach is that it wants to ignore the legislative history

20

underlying the specific provisions.

21

Chapter 23 and 43 and 75 may have been enacted as

22

part of a single statute, but the origin and evolution of those

23

provisions are really quite distinct and quite different.

24

There was no predecessor to Chapter 43, for example, and thus,

25

everything that Congress did there was writing on a new slate.

Whereas if you look at the practice prior to --

The argument that we would make is that -QUESTION:

Well, it must be that Congress was

origin of the various chapter.
MR. NANNES:

11

Oh, I'm sure it was aware of it, Your

12

Honor.

13

urge upon the court is that prior to enactment of the 1978 act,

14

competitive service employees had the right to appeal to the

15

old Civil Service Commission.

16

And veterans had the right to appeal established by statute to

17

the old Civil Service Commission.

18

I guess the objective I -- or the point I would simply

That was by executive order.

And what we maintain is simply that when Congress

19

endeavored to abolish the old Civil Service Commission and to

20

substitute the Merit Systems Protection Board, it simply

21

brought forward and transferred over to that appellate process

22

the same employees who had formerly enjoyed those rights prior

23

to the act.

24
25

Since, of course, Mr. Fausto prior to 1978 would have
had a right to pursue his claim under the Tucker Act, we argue

32
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

that the mere transfer of those responsibilities by Congress in
1978 cannot be read so broadly as to extinguish rights that he
otherwise would have enjoyed.
QUESTION:

mr. Nannes, if I understand it, you are

not relying at all on the fact that the dismissal in this case
invoked the unauthorized use of the government vehicle statute.
You would be here even if the dismissal had just been for no
cause at all.

You would say that even on that basis if the

agency didn't comply with its regulation, you would be entitled
to go to court.
MR. NANNES;:

It might be — it might have been

exceptionally more difficult for Mr. Fausto to so proceed
because he was relying upon the rights established for him by
regulation.

And if we define out those regulatory violations,

then he might have no predicate basis upon which to file in the
Claims Court.
QUESTION:

The regulatory violations being what now?

MR. NANNES::

In this instance it was the failure to

notify him of his right to grieve, and the failure to accord
him a formal hearing —
QUESTION:

Wouldn't he have a right to grieve if he

had been fired for no reason at all?

Or let's say he was fired

for inefficiency.
MR. NANNES:

If he had been fired for inefficiency

25

That's correct, Your Honor.
But under your view of the decision below

if we were to affirm, they might have a Claims Court remedy?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. NANNES:

1

I think that result would certainly not

follow with respect to competitive service and preference

eligible employees, because under the reasoning of the Carducci

4

decision and the legislative history underlying Chapter 75, it

5

was intended to be exclusive for employees within the reach.

judicial review in this instance, nor if we hypothesize a 13-

day suspension, is he likely to be able to obtain judicial

24

All that would be left, I think, is the possibility
that he might be able to complain of an agency disregard of his

obtain judicial review with respect to -QUESTION:

corrected by either administrative regulation, or certainly a

congressional act.

15

But I think that the area that's left as a gap is a

In the absence of broad language either of a specific

16

preclusive sort or of a statutory scheme that supports its

17

broad characterization of the effort by Congress to preclude

18

judicial review, the government does make certain illusions to

19

the possibility of anomalous or illogical results by virtue of

20

the fact that an excepted service employee such as Mr. Fausto

21

might be able to get into court more quickly than might a

22

competitive service or a preference eligible employee.

23

I think the fact that the competitive service

24

employee enjoys the rights that are conferred by Chapter 75 is

25

indeed a very substantial advantage and was intended

36
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

specifically by Congress to confer additional rights on those

2

employees.

3

An employee who is entitled to Chapter 75 rights has

an opportunity to appeal directly from the initial agency

6

statutory right to an expeditious decision in a proceeding in

go directly to the federal circuit.

9

QUESTION:

Is Mr. Fausto entitled not just to

10

judicial review of whether the agency had violated its

11

regulation in failing to give him notice, but also review of

12

whether in fact he had been guilty of unauthorized use of a

13

government vehicle as the agency asserted?

14
15

MR. NANNES:

Your Honor, I think a distinction could

be drawn between the two.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. NANNES:

The record in this case —

I know that.

Do you draw it?

I draw the distinction at least insofar

as to say that the manner in which this case comes to this

court is only in the former situation.

filed suit in the Claims Court, there had already been an

21

administrative determination that his discharge had been

22

unwarranted and unjustified.

23

judicial review is whether he had been made whole under the

24

terms of the Back Pay Act.

25

Because when Mr. Fausto

QUESTION:

7

Why?

Wouldn't the old law have given him

MR. NANNES:

Well, with respect to an excepted

8

service employee, Your Honor, I think he has to look, since he

9

does not have a right by statute to discharge by cause, to

10
11

whether the regulation provides him with such a right.
In the absence of a regulation that provided him with

12

a right to be discharged only for cause, it's hard for me to

13

understand how there would be a record or an evidentiary basis

14

for him to seek a merit's based determination.

QUESTION:

Don't you think this could be termed a

discharge for unsatisfactory performance?

I do not think so, Your Honor.

effort that I think Congress had in mind with respect to

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, did he misuse government vehicles in

the course of his job?

22

MR. NANNES:

No, Your Honor.

23

The allegation in the complaint -- I'm sorry.

The

24

allegation on the administrative record as to what the misuse

25

involved was a circumstance in which over a weekend he

38

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

endeavored to drive a ill child from his base -- his detail

2

duty spot in New York to the family home in Virginia.
Mr. Fausto was under the impression that since he had

3
4

been detailed and his detail included authorization to use a

5

governmental vehicle, that he had the discretion to utilize the

6

vehicle.

7

QUESTION:

Well, his claim was then that it was

within the proper performance of his job.
MR. NANNES:

Yes, Your Honor, except as you and I

understand the term, I think we would characterize if you drive

regulations that indicate that it may not be unofficial use if

13

you use a car within the scope of the detail and the

14

authorization that you have been provided for that car.

But there are elements in the

15

But as I say, that's not an issue that was presented

16

to the Claims Court in terms of a merit's based determination.

17

It simply went to the propriety of the back hold remedy.

18

For a period of time not substantially less than 30

19

years, this court has stressed the necessity that employing

20

agencies adhere to their regulations, and has upheld the

21

ability of employees to obtain judicial review when the

22

agencies do not, at least in the absence of a clear expression

23

by Congress of an intention to preclude such review.

24
25

The Supreme Court in Vitarelli, for example, was
unanimous in this respect, with all of the justices indicating

39
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that they subscribe to this basic proposition.

2

Thus, we return once again to the issue that I --

3

4

violated its regulations.

5

MR. NANNES:

6

QUESTION:

7

his discharge was unwarranted.

I'm not sure I understand your -Well, it's been determined already that

8

MR. NANNES:

9

In this particular instance, the narrow issue

10

presented is whether he was made whole.
QUESTION:

11
12

Well, he doesn't need -- he doesn't need

any court review to establish that.

13

MR. NANNES:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes, Your Honor.

In this instance, that's is correct.
Just a question of the scope of his

remedy.

16

MR. NANNES:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

Mr.

17

Fausto's claim as it reached the Claims Court is whether he had

18

been made whole within the meaning of the Back Pay Act, because

19

if he had not been wrongfully discharged, he would have been on

20

site and had other opportunities to compete for other

21

government jobs at a time when his position was otherwise

22

abolished.

23

We submit to the Court, Your Honors, there simply is

24

not a basis upon which the court can fairly discern that

25

Congress intended to repeal rights that this man would have

40
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

otherwise had to obtain judicial review of the completeness of

2

the remedy that he was awarded by the agency for his wrongful

3

discharge.

4

The government has not dispelled the substantial

5

doubt that this was Congress' intent.

And the government's

6

argument based on statutory scheme makes sense only if the

7

court disregards the legislative history underlying Chapter 75

8

itself.

9

If the court looks at the legislative history

10

underlying Chapter 75, we submit that it must reach the

11

conclusion that Congress did not have an intention to address

12

the availability of judicial review of nonpreference excepted

13

service employees.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I guess they argue that we should

15

look at the entire structure of Chapter 43 and T5, and the

16

whole picture; not just isolate 75.

17

MR. NANNES:

18

I mean, I certainly would not suggest to the court

Yes, Your Honor.

19

that the court should not look at Chapter 23 and 43.

But I

20

think there is a limit as to the conclusions one can draw from

21

a review of all the statutory provisions.

22

different legislative histories and backgrounds, and they

23

simply, I would submit, are unhelpful in educating the court as

24

to what Congress may have intended with respect to Mr. Fausto

25

at a time that it enacted Chapter 75 which merely codified

ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

9
10
11

MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Nannes.

I would like to very briefly address the

nature of what actually happened.
Mr. Fausto was notified that the agency intended to

12

discharge him, and he was allowed to respond to that before he

13

was discharged.

14

error that was committed was that the agency did not then tell

15

him that he had a right to file a grievance.

16

The error that was committed, and the only

A year later, after the camp at which he closed -- at

17

which he worked had closed, the agency realized that it had

18

made a mistake.

19

It then told him he could file a grievance.

He did file a grievance.

He was awarded seven months

20

back pay; back pay from the date the mandatory 30-day

21

suspension would have ended, until the camp closed.

22

What was subsequently held by the federal circuit was

23

that even though it had done that and granted him his grievance

24

rights, and even though a 30-day suspension was mandatory, that

25

somehow the agency lost its right to suspend him for 30 days as

42
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a result of failing to notify him of the right to filing a

2

grievance such that the grievance proceeding occurred late in

3

the day.

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

8

MR. WRIGHT -- clear that the only mistake here was

9

failing to notify him that he had a right to a grievance.
One point that's worth noting is that one area that

10
11

Congress wanted employees, including nonveterans and the

12

excepted service to still be able to file claims in court, was

13

in discrimination cases.

14

in Section 7707 and 7702 has very carefully integrated the

15

procedures in discrimination cases with the procedures it set

16

up in Chapters 43 and 75.
So in that area Congress wanted to preserve a right.

17
18

And as we have pointed out, Congress

It preserved it.
The final point I'd like to make is that there are

19
20

indeed anomalous results flowing from the court's decision

21

below.

22

that a veteran competitive service employee cannot go to court

23

to challenge a 10-day suspension, he thinks that an excepted

24

service employee could.

25

The amicus has told us that even though it's undisputed

There is anomaly in Section -- Chapter 43 versus

43
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Chapter 75 that we have discussed.

And finally, there is a

2

short of reverse anomaly even though probationary employees are

3

excluded from Chapter 75 in the same sentence of the same

4

subsection as excepted service employees.

5

they, of course, have no right of action, whereas this employee

6

does.

7

meant to exclude nonveterans excepted service personnel and

8

probationary employees from going to court except in

9

discrimination cases.

We don't think that's right.

It is thought that
