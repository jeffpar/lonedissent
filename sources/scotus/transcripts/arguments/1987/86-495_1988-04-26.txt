Very well, Mr. Cohen, you may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. COHEN, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11

it please the.Court, the parties to this case agree that

12

Section 526 protects a U.S. trademark owner against importa­

13

tion of goods bearing its mark that were manufactured abroad

14

by some other firm, even if that other firm has the legal

15

right to use the mark in the foreign country.

16

Respondents brought this lawsuit to establish that

17

Section 526 also does something quite different, namely,

18

entitle the U.S. trademark owner to bar importation of

19

goods that it itself or a company under common control

20

manufactured, stamped with the trademark, and sold into

21

commerce abroad.

22

We disagree.

Our central point is this:

Substantive U.S.

23

trademark law does not give a trademark owner any right to

24

restrain the distribution of its own goods after sale.

25

Section 526 was designed to correct a judicial mistake that
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

1

allowed the importation of infringing goods that had been

2

manufactured by somebody else.

3

having also given the trademark owner an anomalous, even

4

revolutionary new right to bar importation of its own

5

genuine good which could be sold in this country by anyone

6

without infringement if only they can get across the border.

7

It need not be read as

To take a particular example, General Motors can

8

stop anybody else from making a car and selling it as a

9

Chevrolet, but as this Court made clear in the Prestonettes

10

case and in the Champion Sparkplug case, and as Judge Snead

11

explained in the Ninth Circuit in the recent NEC Electronics

12

case, and as most of us know from experience, anyone apart

13

from contract rights can sell a used genuine Chevrolet with

14

the Chevrolet logo on it without General Motors' permission.

15

We think Treasury properly concluded that Congress

16

did not inadvertently give General Motors, which has no

17

right at all to restrain the further distribution of a

18

Chevrolet it sells in Maryland, a right to dictate that a

19

car it has sold in France may never enter this country.

20

Section 526, as its legislative history makes clear,

21

and as Learned Hand said in 1923 in the LeBlume case, was

22

intended to do something quite modest.

23

century, U.S. law has barred importation of goods bearing

24

simulated U.S. trademarks

25

U.S. trademark owner.

Since the 19th

applied by someone other than the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

In 1921, in the Katzel case, the Second Circuit

2

held quite erroneously that French goods bearing a mark

3

affixed by the person who was entitled to affix that mark in

4

France were noninfringing and could be imported into this

5

country even though someone else unrelated to the French

6

company owned that mark in this country.

7

corrected the Second Circuit but not before Congress had

8

dealt with the casus omissus, as Judge Hand called it,

9

by adopting Section 526 to make clear that even if a mark has

10

been lawfully applied abroad, the goods that bear it may be

11

denied importation if somebody else owned the mark in this

12

country.

13

This Court promptly

There is just no evidence that anyone wanted to

14

give a multinational enterprise, be it General Motors or

15

Honda or Pears Soap, the power to block importation of

16

genuine goods it itself sold abroad.

17

reading the statute in its legal and historical context,

18

interprets it as not referring to a mark applied abroad

19

by the very U.S. trademark owner who now seeks to exclude

20

the goods or his affiliate or his licensee.

21

?.nd so Treasury,

Respondents' arguments come down, I suggest, to a

22

contention that the text does not allow that reading.

23

fact it is the kind of reading that this Court has often

24

given to statutes even without the benefit of the long

25

regulatoxy history that we have here. Where a statute has a
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

But in

5

1

narrow reading that is perfectly consonant with its text and

2

its legislative history, and there is also a broader

3

reading that the words might literally bear, but which would

4

work an implausible change in the settled legal context, this

5

Court has not hesitated to decline on contextual grounds to

6

give the statute a broad literal reading.

7

That's what happened in O'Connor, the Puerto Rican,

8

excuse me, the Panamanian treaty case when the Court said

9

that the words "any tax" do not refer to U.S. taxes because

10

an exemption from U.S. taxation would be too implausible to

11

have been what the draftsmen meant.

12

The Court did the same thing in Watt against

13

Alaska when it said that the term "minerals in wildlife

14

refuges" do not include minerals in reserved lands, but only

15

in acquired lands, even though wildlife refuges were defined

16

to include both reserved and acquired lands, because the

17

context suggested that that's not what Congress meant.

18

That's what the Court did in the 1940 American

19

Trucking Association's case, when it said that the term

20

"employees of motor carriers" are referred in context —

21

not in the context of anything else in the statute, but in

22

the context of the general background of the law to

23

employees in safety-related jobs.

24

It's what the Court did in the Guerra case when

25

it said that the statute saying that pregnant women shall
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

be treated the same as other employees set a floor, not a

2

ceiling, meant they should be treated no worse but not -- no

3

better, because Congress wasn't worried about the problem

4

of excessively favorable treatment of pregnant employees.

5

It's what we all do when we assume that the words

6

"No Sleeping in This Railroad Station" do not mean that it

7

is illegal to fall asleep while waiting for a train.

8

Since I think at the very least there is no

9

unambiguously expressed intention of Congress to give a

10

trademark owner the help of the Customs Service in excluding

11

its own goods --

12

13

QUESTION:
expressed?

14

MR. COHEN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Why is that not unambiguously

Well, because -I mean, I'd like to think that, but why

is that not unambiguously expressed?
MR. COHEN:

Because the statute does not, I think,

18

focus on the precise question at issue.

19

that bear a trademark, registered and so forth, may not be

20

imported without the consent of the U.S. trademark owner,

21

but it does not, I think, answer the question whether the

22

term "bears a trademark" there means to refer to a trademark

23

that is -- that has been applied by the very person who now

24

seeks to exclude the goods.

25

QUESTION:

It says that goods

So when we have a general statute, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628*4888

7

1

is ambiguous as to each of the specific instances that its

2

language covers?

3

MR. COHEN:

No, when you have a general statute

4

there is -- yes, there is room for interpretation.

5

when the Court has said a statute speaks to the precise

6

question at issue, it's really meant, does the statute

7

focus on that question the way the statute did in the

8

Dimension Financial case, when there is a definition that is

9

aimed at precisely the question the Court is trying to

10

answer.

11

12
13

I think

Here, the words leave open the question whether
that is what Congress meant -QUESTION:

They cover the situation.

You

14

acknowledge that.

15

point is simply that the words do not say -- well, in

16

essence you're saying, we have a statute that says,

17

all colors --

The words cover the situation.

18

MR. COHEN:

19

QUESTION:

Your

They cover the situation -We have a statute that says all

20

colors, but you're saying yes, but the statute does not

21

say, including red.

22

MR. COHEN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. COHEN:

25

They cover the situation —
That's essentially your argument.
No, I think in that case you would

say that somebody deliberately focused on how many colors.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

Here, we have a statute that, like a statute that says any

2

tax, and is held not to include U.S. taxes, as in the more

3

recent cases --

4

QUESTION:

We relied on other contexts, on other

5

language and contexts of the statute in that case.

6

didn't say, as far as we know Congress didn't focus on this

7

particular tax.

8

We just

We relied upon the rest of the statute.

MR. COHEN:

But the basic reason for the reading

9

the Court reached in that case after saying there was, I

10

believe the phrase was, some textual evidence, albeit

11

subtle, the basic reading that the Court reached was based

12

on the legal context in which the statute was written and the

13

implausibility of the conclusion that Congress meant to cover

14

a case that there was no sign that it had deliberately

15

adverted to, or in that case the draftsmen of the agreement.

16

There has to be room to say that words that can

17

apply generally, words like "employees" in the Motor Carrier

18

Act which have a commonly understood meaning, nevertheless

19

don't have -- don't necessarily have their full reach, and

20

it has to be possible, it seems to me, to say that where

21

there is no evidence that anyone adverted and adverted in

22

the drafting to the particular -- to the particular question

23

at issue, that one can look at context, and there is also

24

room, it seems to me, then for a regulatory interpretation

25

as well.

It seems to me that this -Heritage Reporting Corporation

QUESTION:

1

2

term "bears" or is it "ownership and domicile?"

3

MR. COHEN:

4

QUESTION:

5

Well, is the ambiguity here in the

I think —
Or is it in the whole thrust of the

statute ?

6

MR. COHEN:

Well, I think it is in the whole

7

thrust of the statute, but I think that the way I would

8

prefer to say it is, the question is whether "bears a

9

trademark" means to include the case where the trademark was

10

applied by the very person who now seeks to exclude the

11

goods, or whether that is a case that is outside of

12

Congress's concern just as treating pregnant women more

13

favorably than other employees is not within what Congress

14

meant when it said, treat them the same.

15

QUESTION:

I thought if there is one given constant

16

in this case it's the word "trademark," and it's the

17

ownership and the domiciliary of the trademark holder that's

18

in question.

19

MR. COHEN:

20

QUESTION:

21

itself is ambiguous?

22

MR. COHEN:

I think —
Or are you saying that "trademark"

I think that the question is whether

23

the statute applies to exclude goods bearing a trademark that

24

has been applied by the same person who now seeks to exclude

25

them.

It is -Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1C

1

QUESTION:

But the statute doesn't say that anyone

2

can exclude a trademark.

3

domiciliary can exclude the goods bearing the mark.

4
5

MR. COHEN:

Well, yes, and the very fact that

the statute --

6
7

It says that the owner and the

QUESTION:

So it seems to me that that's the focus

of the statute.

8

MR. COHEN:

Well, the very fact that the statute

9

limits the power of exclusion to a U.S. owner and indeed

10

to goods of foreign manufacture is, I think, some textual

11

evidence that Congress's intent here was simply to give a

12

U.S. owner who was separate from the foreign manufacturer of

13

the goods the power to exclude those goods because they

14

infringe his trademark over here.

15

limitations make any sense if what we're talking about is a

16

general right of a trademark owner to control the distribu­

17

tion of its own goods.

18

draw any distinction between a U.S. citizen's and other

19

persons --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

I don't think those

Most U.S. trademark law does not

So one of your major propositions is

that "bears a trademark" is an ambiguous phrase?
MR. COHEN:

I think that the question whether the

23

whole statute reaches this case, as Treasury has said, I

24

think, since 1936, certainly since the mid-forties, is the

25

question on which the statute is ambiguous.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

QUESTION:

1

Well, then, it seems to me the question

2

may become whether the regulation so transcends whatever

3

ambiguity is there that there's no statutory anchor for it.

4

Is that the issue in the case?

5

MR. COHEN:

I think that the -- no.

I think that

6

what the regulation does is to say, this is a statute that

7

was written to fill a hole, to enable a U.S. trademark owner

8

to keep out goods that are infringing here but are -- but

9

are genuine abroad, and the question is whether that statute

10

also does something that the petitioner in the Prestonettes

11

case described from this podium 63 years ago as

12

revolutionary, and the Court agreed with him, namely, to

13

give -- that it did not -- namely, to give the U.S. trademark

14

owner a chance, a means of restraining the distribution of

15

its own goods.

16
17

I would like to reserve the remainder of my time,
if I may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQUIRE

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS

22

MR. LEWIN:

Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

23

it please the Court, our position that Section 526 is

24

broad enough to entitle the Customs Service to give it the

25

construction which it has done for at least the past 50 years
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12

1

is based on, we think, three factors.

2

and the particular addition of specific statutory language,

3

and that is the language dealing with ownership by an

4

American corporation.

5

clear that that specific language was put in in conference

6

after the Senate debate which ended with some uncertainty

7

about the Pears Soap hypothetical, which is close precisely

8

to the situation presented by the present litigation.

9

One is the use of

The legislative history makes it

And it is subsequent to that time that the con­

10

ference determined to make it clear that what Congress was

11

protecting in 1922 were American owners, and American owners

12

of trademarks, we submit, does not include and was never

13

intended to include a multinational foreign corporation whic

14

could set up a wholly owned American subsidiary, ^nd that

15

brings us to the second, as it were, ambiguity in this

16

statute which entitled Customs to arrive at the result,

17

which is that the statute was enacted in 1922, and in our

18

supplemental memorandum we quoted for the Court various

19

references that were made at that time, and it was a time

20

when the corporate layering that is now customary was, we

21

submit, in its infancy, that at that time Congress was not

22

contemplating foreign, wholly owned subsidiaries.

23

that kind of a corporate structure was something to which

24

the courts were ready to look through and say you weren't

25

an American owner, you weren't the owner.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It was --

The real owner

13

1

was whoever the corporate parent was.

2

history is important.

3

think, looks to what Congress would have had in mind at the

4

time, and in 1922 we submit Congress would have had in mind

5

not protecting what would have been a layer in which the

6

American trademark owner was simply the subsidiary of a

7

foreign corporation.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LEWIN:

'So we think the

The plain language principal, we

How do we know that?
Well, because all the language in the

10

legislative history speaks about protecting American manu­

11

facturers and producers from fraud.

12

QUESTION:

Does anyone speak about not protecting

13

others?

14

that would exclude this situation.

15

there's nothing there --

16

I mean, there is nothing in the legislative history

MR. LEWIN:

You are just saying

There's nothing in the legislative

17

history that says -- except that the case that gave rise,

18

of course, to this problem was one which involved a

19

foreign manufacturer that had sold its rights to an

20

American corporation and, if anything, the respondents are

21

claiming this is xenophobic, but if anything the indication

22

is that the Congress was concerned about the American pur­

23

chasers.

24

there was a wish to affect trademark law in some way.

25

respondents have talked about this as raising the principle

Never was there the slightest suggestion that

That was not discussed in the

QUESTION:

It was clear that what Congress was

You think we should only interpret

6

statutes to do — to resolve that one problem that prompted

them?

8

particular problem, but they are drawn more broadly, and

9

later on other things come along, and we don't go back and

10

look at it and say, well, gee, it's just this one narrow

11

problem that they had in mind.

12

statute that covers more things, we say it covers them.

13

We have a lot of statutes that are prompted by a

MR. LEWIN:

If they wrote a broader

That is certainly true, Justice Scalia,

14

but it is not true if what was -- what happens later on was

15

wholly unanticipated.

16

strokes and say that things that are out on the periphery

17

we are not going to deal with with a specific exception, but

18

if what Congress -- if what happens is the growth of multi­

19

national corporations and the situation that is now presented

20

by the gray market was not anticipated by the 1922 Congress,

21

then it's appropriate that Congress look at what happened

22

then.

23

decided about a month ago, when there was as clear a law as

24

could possibly have been enacted which said that certain

obligations were free from all taxation now or hereafter

It is true, Congress can draw broad

taxation now or hereafter, which would have included estate

taxes.

6

we are looking at the context of what Congress could possibly

7

have contemplated at the time.

8

What was Congress looking at in

Not estate taxes, even though the statute said all

But the Court said, we are looking at the history,

QUESTION:

We had one word in that case that we

9

could interpret more narrowly that would produce the result

10

that you wanted, the word "taxation."

11

of this, or did it mean somewhat less?

12

even two words in this statute can you point to which, if

13

given a narrower interpretation, would produce the result

14

here that you want?

15

MR. LEWIN:

Did taxes mean all
What one word or

I think it is the words "owned by a

16

citizen of or a corporation created or organized within the

17

United States," and we think that that means not someone

18

who is a subsidiary of a foreign corporation.

19

Let me take slight issue with you, Justice Scalia.

20

There were two words that were relevant, and I think it points;

21

up the question you asked Mr. Cohen.

23

that that is comparable to your analogy of all colors.

Congress said all taxes, not simply taxes, and yet this

Court said estate taxes are somewhat different.

The words were "all

QUESTION:

Well, as I understand the statute, it

2

does restrict an American corporation if the American

3

corporation licenses a foreign manufaturer and the goods

4

somehow find their way back here.

5

MR. LEWIN:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, and again -So I point that out to you and ask you

7

to comment on it in light of what you have just told

8

Justice Scalia, and secondly, I would say that you began by

9

saying Congress put in these words in the conference section

10

"American corporation," and you somehow transpose that into an

11

intent to protect the American consumer.

12

how that follows.

13

MR. LEWIN:

I am not so sure

With regard to your second question,

14

I am speaking about an American corporation.

15

corporation that is a subsidiary or an arm or a corporate

16

agent of a wholly owned subisidiary of the foreign

17

corporation.

18

Indeed, it protects many distributors like my client and

19

K-Mart who over the course of the years have relied on

20

Customs' interpretation, which did not spring out of the blue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALLEN, ESQUIRE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7

MR. ALLEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8

it please the Court, I want to turn, address myself first

9

to what Mr. Cohen described as the central point of the case

10

on the other side, the point that as I understand is thought

11

to make it implausible that Congress meant what it said when

12

it wrote Section 526.

13

trademark cannot prohibit the sale of goods bearing that

14

trademark once unchanged, once he has first sold them or

15

put them into commerce, but there really isn't any such

16

first sale doctrine insofar as international transactions

17

are concerned.

18

That is the idea that an owner of a

The doctrine just doesn't fit with the concept of

19

territoriality of trademarks.

20

in this Court's opinion in the Katzel case to which you have

21

heard reference this morning.

22

to speak of the trademark on the face powder as distributed

23

in the United States as being that of the French manufacturer

24

of the trademark, even though it came from there, because in

25

law, he said, it is the trademark only of the United States

Justice Holmes explained it

He said it wasn't accurate

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

21

1

Bourjois company in this country, and there are very solid

2

factual reasons for this territorial view of trademarks.

3

For one thing, for one thing, products differ from

4

country to country.

5

nothing about which my clients need feel embarrassed.

6

the differences don't have anything to do, either, with

7

whether the United states distributor or manufacturer of the

8

products does or does not have corporate ties to the firm that

9

makes the products for overseas distribution.

Nothing sinister about those differences,
And

10

Differences result simply from differing tastes,

11

differing environmental conditions, differing laws as well

12

as the fact that goods intended for markets other than the

13

United States may not be appropriately packed for shipment

14

to the United States, or they may lack United States

15

distributors' valuable warranty on the goods, or differences

16

simple as the fact that fresh batteries made in the

17

United States will make your flashlight light up, whereas

18

batteries that are a long time in the shipping here and

19

aren't meant to be won't make your flashlight light up-

20

The fact of these differences between products

21

intended for the United States market and products not

22

intended for the United States market, intended for some

23

other product, is one of the reasons why Section 526, if

24

enforced as written, conforms fully with the policy of the

25

trademark law.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

One of those policies is to protect consumers

1

2

against deception and confusion, and Section 526 would do

3

that by ensuring that consumers were not imposed upon by

4

products that were not quite the products they associate

5

with familiar United States trademarks.

6

Furthermore, Section 526, if enforced as written,

7

protects the trademark owner against erosion of his invest­

8

ment in the good will that, is represented by the trademark,

9

and that is the other principal goal in the trademark law.

10

In the kinds of goods we are concerned with here, the trade­

11

mark owner makes heavy investments, advertising, promoting

12

his brand, quality assurance and service, both pre-sala and

13

post-sale service. The gray market goods, the goods that

14

come here, though not intended for the United States market

15

do not bear the costs of those promotional and service

16

investments and don't yield the trademark owner any return

17

on them.

18

I believe that I'm a biased listener, but I thought

19

I heard it conceded this morning that Section 526 is written

20

in terms broad enough to cover the cases that the Customs

21

Service regulations deprive of its coverage.

22

me to mean that the contested issues are whether

23

Section 526 is fairly susceptible to a narrow reading, and

24

not just any narrow reading, but a narrow reading that

25

fits the Customs Service regulations and at the same time
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That seems to

23

1

keeps faith with the words that Congress chose, and second,

2

whether there is any good reason in the legislative history

3

or elsewhere for reading the statute in that narrow way.

4

I believe that the answer to both questions is a

5

pretty resounding no.

6

take them up in their logical order, text first, secondary

7

sources second, even though the order of emphasis,

8

petitioners' argument is just the opposite.

9

them correctly, they say repeatedly and loudly that secondary

10

sources indicate a Congressional intent less sweeping than

11

the words of the statute indicate, and then they add, and

12

this almost -- again, I'm a biased listener, but it seemed

13

to me it almost had to be dragged out of them this morning,

14

oh, yes, sotto vocde, you can construe those words to accord

15

with our view of Congressional intent, even if you have to

16

insert into the statutory text what Mr. Cohen in one of his

17

papers calls an implicit contextual qualification.

I am going to take them up, plan to

If I hear

18

It seems to me that that argument is close to if it

19

is not -- is the same argument that was rejected by the Court

20

just last week in the Puerto Rico petroleum price

21

regulation preemption case.

22

the Court there described as giving effect to Congressional

23

intent in a vacuum unrelated to the giving of meaning to

24

an enacted statutory text.

25

That's an argument for what

That person had to allege that he had used the trademark in

all, after all, one of the examples in addition to the

It is certainly very far, very far from the failure

to anticipate a certain application that might, I can con­

18

ceive of, justify reading a statute in a -- in a narrow way,

19

but this was -- I submit, perhaps it is proliferating, as

20

Your Honor says, but it was certainly not unknown to

21

the Congress of 1922 that there could be intercorporate

22

relations of this sort.

23

writing this amendment to the Tariff Act dealing with

24

trademarks, it drew upon the concepts used in the trademark

25

law of the time.

And it drew for its concepts in

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30

1

And I submit that when a Congress did indeed, as

2

this Congress did, use the familiar words and concepts of

3

the trademark registration statute, it would not have

4

intended the Customs Service to apply a new, different, and

5

unusual set of criteria in determining ownership, domicile,

6

or corporate citizenship for the purposes of Section 526.

7

And all of this, all of what I've said to this

point is quite aside from the case of American manufacturers

9

and producers that are denied the protection of Section 526

That can only be a United States

And this is so clear that regulations

aren't needed to clarify it?
MR. ALLEN:

Regulations are not -- these regula­

15

tions do not clarify that point, Your Honor.

16

perhaps I can get at it in a different way.

17

perfectly permissible for a trademark in the United -- for

18

a trademark as it applies to goods that are in the commerce

19

of the United States to be owned by and registered by the

20

distributor of those goods, and not the manufacturer.

21

Let me -It is

So take, for example, the Bourjois Company of

22

the Bourjois and Katzel..

23

trademark for the French face powder, Java.

24

least that Congress did and the least that this Court did

25

was to say that the goods bearing that trademark, even

though it was the authentic trademark in France, and even

2

though genuine, could not be imported into the United States

3

to compete with the Bourjois companies, the Bourjois

4

companies' goods bearing the trademark that it owned in the

5

United States and had registered in the United States.

6

In that sense, in that sense only do I argue that

7

there can only be one owner of the trademark.

8

multiple owners of a trademark insofar as it is used in

9

different countries.

10

is only the case of that sort of multiple ownership that

11

the Customs Service regulations say that Section 526 applies

12

to •

13

There can be

That -- and indeed, it is exactly — it

I say it applies even though, even though, and the

14

words of the statute, I submit, bear me out, it applies

15

even though that trademark in France, Japan, wherever it may

16

be, is owned by a company affiliated with the owner of the

17

trademark in the -- who has used it in the commerce of the

18

United States and has registered it with the Patent and

19

Trademark Office.

20

QUESTION:

So goods that have a French trademark

21

suddenly have a U.S. trademark the minute they land in

22

New York.

23

Is that it?
MR. ALLEN:

They cannot be brought into the

24

United States because that trademark is the trademark of

25

the American owner of the trademark only in the United States

Section 526 was a modest statute,
