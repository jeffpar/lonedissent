CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Merrill, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL, ESQUIRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MERRILL:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
This case presents an important question of statutory

10
11

interpretation involving the Department of Energy's Uranium

12

Enrichment Program.

13

authorizes the Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of

14

Energy, to provide enrichment services for utilities, both

15

domestic and foreign, that operate nuclear power plants.

16

That section goes on to provide that DOE shall

Section 161(v) of the Atomic Energy Act

17

restrict its enrichment of foreign uranium for use in domestic

18

power plants to the extent necessary to assure the maintenance

19

of a viable domestic uranium industry.
The Court of Appeals in this case construed this

20
21

language to mean that when the domestic uranium industry is not

22

viable, DOE must automatically stop all enrichment of foreign

23

uranium, even if this would not make the domestic industry

24

viable.

25

We disagree.

Heritage

In our view, the Statute instructs DOE
3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

to restrict enrichment of foreign uranium only to the extent

2

that such restrictions will in fact make the domestic industry

3

viable and does not instruct that DOE must impose enrichment

4

restrictions when it would not have the effect of making the

5

domestic industry viable.

6

This case was decided below on Respondent's Motion

7

for Summary Judgment.

8

theory is that the status of the domestic uranium industry

9

whether or not it is currently viable.

10

The key fact under the Court of Appeals

As to that fact, there

is no dispute.
The Secretary of Energy has found in a series of

11

12

annual viability determinations that the domestic uranium

13

mining and milling industry is not currently viable.

14

QUESTION:

What does that mean in the context of that

15

finding?

16

sufficient to satisfy ail our domestic needs?

17

That it can't make a profit, or that it won't be

MR. MERRILL:

The meaning of viability is spelled out

in some detail, first of all, by Congress.

19

statute in 1982, Section 170(b) of the Atomic Energy Act, which

20

sets forth eight criteria the Department of Energy is to look

21

at in making a viability determination.

22

Congress passed a

The Secretary has in turn issued regulations under

23

that Statute which further spells out the method that will be

24

followed in determining viability.

25

QUESTION:

Does the Congressional statute require

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

that viability be determined by ability to meet national needs,

2

rather than profitability?
MR. MERRILL:

3

We think clearly yes.

Although the

4

criteria are complex that the gist of the statutory criteria

5

and of the Secretary's regulations are to focus on the

6

capability of the domestic industry in satisfying the needs of

7

the nuclear power industry in the event of certain future

8

contingencies such as an interruption of imports.
Neither the statutory criteria nor the regulations

9
10

focus merely on the profitability of the domestic industry.

11

for example if you had one or two domestic uranium plants that

12

were very profitable but nevertheless did not have the capacity

13

to satisfy the needs of the domestic industry, that would not

14

be a viable industry.

15

resources, both in terms of reserves production capacity and

16

financial strength to satisfy the needs of the domestic power

17

industry.
QUESTION:

18
19

So

A viable industry is one which has the

It's a strange use of the word, I must

say.
MR. MERRILL:

20

Well, whether it's a strange use or

21

not, Congress clearly set forth the criteria in 1982 which were

22

to be used, and the criteria focused on things like the

23

production capacity of the industry and its financial

24

resources.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, in opposing the Motion for

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

Summary Judgment, is that the position the Government took that

2

that's what viability meant?

MR. MERRILL:

The meaning of viability was never

really confronted in this case.

6

District Court on the question.

It was raised in Count V of

13

QUESTION:

The Department of Energy has

What my question really was directed to

was what position the Government took in opposition to the

15

Motion for Summary Judgment.

16

theory of viability at that time?

17

MR. MERRILL:

Did they espouse a particular

The Department's theory throughout this

18

case has been that the statute, contrary to the lower court's,

19

does not require restrictions be imposed whenever the domestic

20

industry is not viable.

21

the effects that restrictions would have on the viability of

22

the domestic industry.

23

The statute requires an inquiry into

So in our view, what the statute requires is that the

24

Secretary look at the condition of the domestic industry and

25

consider the effect of restricting enrichment of foreign

uranium on that condition and act accordingly.

2

industry is viable and does not need any restriction on foreign

3

imports, no restrictions are appropriate.

4

If the domestic

On the other hand, if the industry is not viable and

5

restrictions on imports would not do anything to make it

6

viable, the statute also does not require restrictions.

7

QUESTION:

I'm still not quite sure I've got an

8

answer to my question.

Let me phrase it this way, if I may: I

9

take it there would be a distinction between saying that even

10

if we impose restrictions, that will not make the industry

11

viable.

That might be one position you'd take.
A second position might be that even if we impose

12

13

restrictions, that will not help the industry even in the

14

slightest.

Do you understand?

15

MR. MERRILL:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19

20
21

22

I understand.

Which if either of those two positions did

you take in the trial court?
MR. MERRILL:
up to this point.

I'm not sure what position we've taken

Our position --

QUESTION:

I'm talking in opposition to the Motion

for Summary Judgment?
MR. MERRILL:

Our position has been throughout that

23

the statute requires an examination of the effects of

24

restrictions and restrictions must be such as are necessary to

25

insure the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry.
7

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8
1

It must make the industry viable.
QUESTION:

2

So you're saying that even if the

3

restrictions might tend to improve the condition of the

4

industry, they still would not be imposed unless they would

5

have the ultimate benefit of making a non-viable industry

6

viable?

7

MR. MERRILL:

Yes, we think that's correct.

If the

8

latter interpretation that you're suggesting were the

9

appropriate one, we think the statute would have used words

10

like, promote, the viable of the domestic uranium industry.

11

But the statute uses the word instead, assure, the maintenance

12

of a viable domestic uranium industry.

13

statutory language requires not just restrictions that would

14

make the industry a little better off, but that it would

15

produce an industry with the capability of serving the needs of

16

the domestic nuclear power industry.

17

So we think the

Furthermore, even if the statute meant what you're

18

suggesting, that restrictions would have some beneficial

19

effect, that would require reversal of the judgment in this

20

particular case, because the Court of Appeals' theory of the

21

statute is that no inquiry into effects is required whatsoever.

22

Once you find that the domestic industry is not viable, bang,

23

that ends the matter, and the Department of Energy must impose

24

one hundred percent restrictions.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, on the meaning of viable
8

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

9

1

question, it is a little hard to understand how a domestic

2

industry could be available to meet national needs if it can't

3

make any money.

4

MR. MERRILL:

Yes, Your Honor, and in fact, one of

5

the four factors that the Department of Energy looks at in

6

determining whether or not the industry is viable are the

7

financial resources of the industry.

8

years to finding --

9

QUESTION:

And the key in recent

It just seems to be necessarily tied in if

10

the companies simply can't make any money producing, how can

11

they be available to meet national needs?

12

MR. MERRILL:

We agree with that, Your Honor.

The

13

financial resources of the industry are an integral part of

14

determining whether or not they have the capability of serving

15

the needs of the domestic industry.

16

But in order to be capable of serving the needs of

17

the domestic power industry, they must have considerable

18

financial resources to raise the capital that's necessary to

19

build the production facilities that will produce a substantial

20

quantity of uranium.

21

And it's the Secretary's determination that those

22

financial resources are not in the picture at this particular

23

time and that imposing restrictions on foreign uranium would

24

not put those financial resources into the picture.

25

it's the Secretary's view that such restrictions would be

They would not in the long run help the

But again, that issue was not addressed below.

The

4

question of the effects one way or the other was not addressed

5

by the lower courts.

6

that kind of inquiry just was not required by the statute.

7

QUESTION:

They went off on this legal theory that

So the reason for the non-viability

8

determination by the Secretary is relevant to our consideration

9

of this case and to the operation of the statute?

10

MR. MERRILL:

I don't think that the issue before

11

this Court requires the Court to get into an analysis of the

12

Secretary's reasoning about the effects of --

13

QUESTION:

Not his reasoning, but his reasons.

14

MR. MERRILL:

Well, it requires of course that the

15

Court consider the legal reasons that we're advancing for the

16

proposition that Section 161(v) does not impose this automatic

17

shutoff whenever the domestic industry is not viable.

18

QUESTION:

No.

My point is suppose the report said

19

that the industry is not viable because there's too much

20

enrichment being given to foreign materials.

21

the reason for non-viability would be critical to the operation

22

of this statute?

23

MR. MERRILL:

24

QUESTION:

25

I take it then

Yes, in that case it would, Your Honor.

And so then it follows that the reasons

that the Secretary gives for the non-viability determination
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

1

should be consulted in determining the operation of the

2

statute.
MR. MERRILL:

3

We agree with that, Your Honor.

In a

4

proper proceeding under this statute, as we interpret it, the

5

Secretary of Energy would examine the effects of restrictions

6

on foreign uranium to see whether or not they would produce a

7

viable domestic industry.

0

made, then some type of judicial review proceeding would be

9

appropriate we think to examine that reasoning and that

Once that determination had been

10

rationale to see whether or not it was arbitrary and capricious

11

or whether or not it comported with the statute.
That's not the case that you have here.

Court and the Court of Appeals did not review any of the

reasoning that the Secretary advanced in the 1986 rulemaking.

That was not before the Court.

18

automatic imposition whenever the domestic industry is not

19

viable.

20

QUESTION:

The lower courts went off on a

It simply requires an

Well, should the case go back or should we

21

assess the viability report here and say the statute cannot

22

possibly operate.

23

Is that your view?

MR. MERRILL:

No.

This Court in our view should

24

simply examine the legal rationale the lower court gave in

25

support of the District Court's summary judgment order, and if
11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12
1

the Court finds that the statute does mandate an inquiry into

2

effects, that the judgment should be reversed.

3

then go back to the District Court for further appropriate

4

proceedings.

The case would

We think that two things are critical with regard to

5

6

those further proceedings.

7

under a correct interpretation of the statute which is that the

8

statute requires an inquiry into the effects of restrictions.

9

And secondly under the statute, it's the Department of Energy's

10

One, that they should take place

responsibility to make the findings about effects.
The District Court is not to conduct a trial de novo

11

12

into the conditions of the uranium industry but rather, it's

13

the Department's responsibility to make that, subject of course

14

to appropriate judicial review under the Administrative

15

Procedure Act.
QUESTION:

16

My problem, Mr. Merrill, is that to some

17

extent, my determination of what the statute means when it says

18

that they will provide it if necessary to assure the viability,

19

depends to some extent upon what I think the statute means by

20

viability.

21

likely to bear the meaning you want it to bear, and if it means

22

another, somewhat less likely.

23

25

If it means one thing by viability, it is more

That's why I wanted to know what your interpretation
of what it means is.
MR. MERRILL:

As best I recollect, the dispute that
12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

13
1

was raised in Count V of the Complaint in this case was a very-

2

narrow one.

3

capability of serving all the needs of the domestic industry

4

and they criticized the fact that the Secretary, in his 1983

5

rulemaking to define viability, had tinkered with that and had

6

said that it only, it deleted the word, total needs, and just

7

said, needs.

8

contingencies, in the face of future contingencies.

9

The Respondents argued that viability means

And also had qualified it by talking about future

There is no basic dispute between the parties in this

10

case, I don't think, based on that at least, that viability

11

refers to the question of what can the domestic uranium

12

industry do for us, rather than what can we do for it.

13

statute was not intended as a measure to simply provide

14

financial relief for the domestic uranium industry.

15
16
17

The

And it's quite clear, I think, from the original
legislative history that —
QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm still not sure if you're

18

saying the statute does not operate here because of what was

19

said in the report or because the ultimate finding of non­

20

viability was made.

21

question is necessary for us to determine what we're supposed

22

to do with this case, whether we're supposed to decide it here

23

or send it back for more findings.

24
25

And it seems to me that the answer to that

MR. MERRILL:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't think

that the issue before the Court is whether or not restrictions

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14

1
2

should now be imposed on domestic uranium.
The only issue before the Court is whether the Court

3

of Appeal's legal theory was correct, which states that

4

restrictions have to be imposed now because the statute

5

mandates that without any further inquiry into the nature of

6

the domestic uranium industry and its relationship to the world

7

uranium market.

8

9

And so since there's nothing technically in the
record that would allow this Court to review the Secretary's

10

determination of effects, we think that that question properly

11

has to be sent back to be decided through proper proceedings

12

before the Secretary and that the District Court should

13

probably be the appropriate forum to decide what the nature and

14

form of those further proceedings should take.

15

QUESTION:

So you're asking for a remand?

16

MR. MERRILL:

Yes.

We're asking for this Court to

17

reverse the judgment below and remand for further appropriate

18

decisions in light of that.

19

QUESTION:

Has the Department's view of the necessity

20

or propriety of restrictions, has that view always been held by

21

the Department, or did it at one time have a different view?

22

MR. MERRILL:

We think that the Department and its

23

predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, have always

24

articulated a consistent vision of Section 161(v) which is that

25

the statute requires an examination of the effects of

is it.

There are a number of

Well, that isn't really my real question,

I probably haven't put it very well.
Suppose there's a finding — or I'll put it this way

5
6

even if there's a finding, if there is a finding of non­

7

viability, then is restrictions even proper?

8

says, no, it is not.

9

The Department

They should not have any restrictions..

Is that right?
MR. MERRILL:

10

Well, in an appropriate case, if the

11

Department found that the domestic industry was not viable and

12

that restrictions would return it to viability and assure its

13

viability, of course restrictions would be required.

14

what the statute says.

15

QUESTION:

All right, all right.

That's

But has the

16

Department always said no restrictions if the industry's non-

17

viable and restrictions would not make it viable?

18
19

MR. MERRILL:

inconsistent with what you just said.
QUESTION:

20
21

this case?

5

7

QUESTION:

The notice of proposed rulemaking

Well, did the rule when it was made merely

reflect what the practice had been before?
MR. MERRILL:

The 1986 rulemaking took a position

which is completely consistent with the position which has been

9

taken in this litigation.

10
11

12

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't -- did it just reflect

what the prior practice was, or not?
MR. MERRILL:

The 1986 rulemaking retained in effect

13

the enrichment criteria which had been in effect before.

14

current enrichment criteria originate in 1974 and the

15

Department of Energy decided that the domestic industry was —

MR. MERRILL:

Was that by a rule or?
That was by regulation.

That the

18

domestic industry was on its feet sufficiently so that

19

restrictions on foreign uranium could be phased out.

20

the Secretary promulgated a phase-out schedule which started in

21

1977 and in increments proceeded to 1984.

22

In 1974,

From time to time, in the early 1980s, informal

23

inquiries were made as to whether or not some kind of

24

postponement of this phase out or reimposition of restrictions

25

were appropriate.

There were Congressional hearings held in

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

17
1

1981 in which the issue was aired.

2

Throughout this period of time, including the most

recent rulemaking, the Secretary has taken the position that no

4

modification of this 1974 schedule was appropriate.

5

QUESTION:

the industry went downhill.

7

MR. MERRILL:

Justice White, the industry really

QUESTION:

Well, as they phased out the restrictions,

MR. MERRILL:

11

We think that really it had virtually

nothing to do with the removal of restrictions.

out.

15

below ten percent of the total energy requirements of the

16

domestic industry.

17

In the early

There were some imports at that time but they were well

And the industry collapsed at a point in time when

18

imports were really a relatively minor aspect of the picture.

19

Now, since then imports have increased.

20

years imports have been running at around the range of 35 to 45

21

percent of domestic energy needs.

22

In the last three

But the Secretary's position is that because Section

23

161(v) applies only to enrichment of raw uranium and does not

24

restrict imports of enriched uranium and because there are now

25

two European consortia that actually compete with DOE to

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18
1

provide enriched uranium that the imposition of restrictions on

2

unenriched uranium would simply induce domestic utilities in

3

large numbers to flee overseas to these other competitors of

4

DOE and purchase enriched uranium for direct import into the

5

United States.
So for that reason at this point in time, even though

6

7

imports are a fairly large aspect of the picture, the

8

particular mechanism that Section 161(v) establishes would not

9

provide any relief to the industry.
Another aspect of the industry which has emerged is

10
11

there's now an active secondary market.

Because the demand

12

projections that were made in the 1970s about the increased

13

demand for uranium in the future led to a tremendous production

14

exploration activity and created a huge imbalance between

15

MR. MERRILL:

I think, yes, Your Honor.

In 1974 in

3

particular, when DOE announced that it was going to phase out

4

restrictions, there were some Congressional hearings held, but

5

there's nothing that really reflects —

of viability doesn't depend on profits but rather on capacity,

8

what happened to decrease the capacity of the industry to serve

9

the possible national needs in the event that we had to shut

10
11

off imports?
MR. MERRILL:

Well, the initial determination of non­

12

viability was made in 1985 with respect to 1984.

13

primary rationale there was that the industry lacked sufficient

14

financial resources to have the production capacity ten years

15

hence to supply the domestic nuclear power industry in the

16

event of something like an interruption of imports.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

And the

So it was a financial problem rather than

a physical exhausting mines or anything of that kind.
MR. MERRILL:

The Secretary has found that there are

20

sufficient economic reserves, and that for present needs there

21

is sufficient production capacity but the concern is that

22

because of the financial weakness of the industry that

23

somewhere down the future, it will not have sufficient

24

productive capacity in order to satisfy the needs of the

25

domestic industry.

QUESTION:

What it means is, if -- and I'm not

2

suggesting they should -- but if the Government were willing to

3

subsidize production costs or something, there's no suggestion

4

that there isn't the physical capacity to make the industry

5

viable in the sense of being able then to supply them.

6

MR. MERRILL:

The physical capacity in the sense of

7

reserves or?

I think there are more than adequate reserves.

8

The question is whether or not there will be in the future

production capacity, mines, milling equipment and things like

this is the basic reason for the non-viability finding at this

11

point in time.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, if you mean by viability what

13

you say you mean by viability, I find it very implausible that

14

Congress intended what you say it intended.

15

saying that Congress so much cared about whether we had a

16

domestic capacity to produce this uranium that it said we want

you to continue to subsidize this domestic industry up to the

18

point where that subsidy is no longer needed for that industry

19

to fullfil one hundred percent of our domestic needs.

20

You're essentially

However, if you find that that industry is only at

21

best going to be able to fullfil 90 percent of our domestic

22

needs, well, then we don't want you to subsidize it at all.

23

That's an absolutely weird intent.

24

Either give us a domestic industry that can produce a hundred

25

percent of everything we need, or else, don't give us any at

2

Why would Congress intend something like that?

3

Now, if you mean something different by viability, if

4

you mean profitability, that I could understand.
MR. MERRILL:

5

Justice Scalia, I think Congress when

6

it enacted Section 161(v) was basically concerned about two

7

things.

domestic industry in the transitional period from a totally

controlled market where the Government was the sole purchaser

They were concerned about the possible weakness of the

to an open market where private property rights existed in

uranium and there was free buying and selling.

12

to cushion the impact of that transition.

13

And they wanted

And they were also concerned that no one really knew

14

what was going to happen in the next five to ten years and

15

therefore that it was important to have a flexible standard

16

that would be able to accommodate different things that might

17

have happened.

MR. MERRILL:

Well, I don't know, a hundred percent,

95 percent.

The concept of viability is not keyed to

It's a judgmental concept

10

which again focuses on the question of whether or not the

industry will be able to overcome certain types of future

contingencies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. NICKLES, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. NICKLES:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
It is correct as my brother says that we are

5
6

confronted with a question of statutory interpretation.

But I

7

think in light of the questions, it's important to understand

8

very briefly the procedural history.
This view of the Department which I think Justice

9
10

Scalia correctly characterized is a new view.

When in

974,

11

the Atomic Energy Commission proposed to phase out the one

12

hundred percent restriction, it told Congress that we will

3

watch over the industry and if there should be any doubt as to

4

its continuing viability, that is, it's ability to meet the

5

nation's civilian and military needs, we will step in and

6

restrict enrichment.

7

We litigated in the District Court and the Judge had

8

granted a summary judgment imposing an injunction and requiring

9

a rulemaking for the Department to explain why it should not

20

impose restriction in light of its concession as to non­

21

viability.

I would suppose that the Department said

to the Congress, we'll watch over the industry, we'll impose

MR. NICKLES:

MR. NICKLES:

And I

Not at all.

Well, that's what I want to know about.
In 1981, the Department explained that

19

restrictions would impact its enrichment enterprise.

20

Congress enacted Section 161(v), the Atomic Energy Commission

21

had a monopoly on enrichment, and therefore Congress knew that

22

imposing restrictions would have an impact.

23

When

In 1974, the Department then had some competition,

24

and when the Congress asked the Atomic Energy Commission, how

you are viable.

It was phased out between 1974

When the industry in 1981 said to the Department, we
We are non-viable.

The Department said,

that required an annual determination of viability.

And for

back, is viable.

Finally, in 1986, and in 1985, and in 1987, the

representations it made to Congress in 1974 when it said it

to the Court's attention, that this interpretation announced

MR. NICKLES:

We don't believe it's defensible, Your

Honor.

When Congress in 1964 enacted this statute, it made

12

sure that this restriction would work, and as a result of the

statute, one hundred percent restrictions were imposed.

uranium if the Department determines it will work.

impose those restrictions which are necessary to assure the

18

viability of the domestic industry.

19

MR. NICKLES:

20

QUESTION:

Is that what it says?

It says that, Your Honor.

And the Department sits down and says,

21

well, there's no number of restrictions, we can't think of any

22

restrictions that would assure the viability of the domestic

23

industry, and so we can't think of any that would even be

necessary.

There's just none that would work.

QUESTION:

Well, maybe so, but --

MR. NICKLES:

There is non-viability, and as the

Tenth Circuit said, restrictions must be imposed going up to

you get within the language of the statute.

Heritage

You have agreed

37
Reporting Corporation

with their definition of viability.

You're not assuring the

2

maintenance of a viable industry if you put some restrictions

3

in place that will not achieve that goal.
I don't understand your argument, is what I'm saying.

4
5

Maybe you're saying they have to do this and subsidize the

6

industry in addition, but surely this statute doesn't say that.

You know, provide them with money and personnel and things like

that.

MR. NICKLES:

What we're saying is that Congress

assumed in 1964 that these restrictions would work.

QUESTION:

Which you agree is the correct definition

of viability.

9

MR. NICKLES:

Absolutely.

But our position is that

10

the Congress was not giving the agency a power that would not

11

work.

12

should go back to the Congress and say, because this will not

13

work standing alone, and because we are unwilling to impose

14

other restrictions that may antagonize our trading partners,

15

and because of non-proliferation, because of a lot of things,

16

please change the statute.

17

And if the Agency today believes it will not work, it

They have not done that, and on this record and in

18

the light of the legislative history, these restrictions must

19

be imposed if Congress doesn't change the words.

20

QUESTION:

Actually, if I understand your position, I

21

think I understand it even less than Justice Stevens does,

22

because you're not just saying that if you can't make a hundred

Isn't that your position, that it doesn't matter that

the Agency has no, and the Court has no right to inquire

Right?

That's correct.

That's correct.

We've got a clash of very difficult

positions, here.

MR. NICKLES:

I believe so, Justice Scalia.

I must say, I think you read the words, to

the extent necessary, etcetera, out of the statute.

say the Commission shall not offer services.

MR. NICKLES:

It is our reading of the statute that

Congress has made the determination that these restrictions are

16

necessary and that they must be imposed.

17

QUESTION:

Well, then why did they give the agency

any discretion?
MR. NICKLES:

They gave the discretion to the agency

20

to determine what limitations should be imposed.

21

District Court, Your Honor, in imposing an injunction, told the

22

Agency to come forward with a rulemaking to show the Court why

Necessary to do what?

The objective is obviously the

viability of the industry.

7

QUESTION:

Which is a hundred percent?

8

MR. NICKLES:

9

QUESTION:

Well, then what is it?

MR. NICKLES:

10

I don't believe it's a hundred percent.

There's no fixed percentage on it under

11

the Department's determination but it is enough so that if

12

there were to be a disruption in the imports of foreign

13

uranium, this nation could be assured that the domestic

14

industry was viable enough to meet the nation's needs.

15

QUESTION:

But I thought a minute ago you said that

16

even though the subsidies would accomplish not even raising it

17

from 27 percent to 28 percent, they still would have to be

18

allotted.

19

MR. NICKLES:

In our view, Congress made the

20

determination that these subsidies would work to assure the

21

viability of the industry, and that other powers --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

11

MR. MERRILL:

A good deal of the discussion here is

12

focused on questions like what is the proper definition of

13

viability and will the restrictions work or won't they work,

14

and whether the 1986 criteria were proper or improper.

15

those questions are really before the Court.

16

None of

The only question before the Court is the Court of

17

Appeals' statutory interpretation which said that you don't

18

have to look to the effects, all you have to do is look to the

19

status of the industry and if it's not viable, you must impose

20

one hundred percent restrictions.

21

If that is an erroneous reading of the statute, the

22

Court should so determine, and that's really the end of the

23

matter before the Court.

24
25

I think for that reason, the discussion about the
1986 continuing resolution is also quite irrelevant.

Heritage

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

All that

43
1

resolution says on its face is that nothing in the resolution

2

or in the 1986 criteria are to affect the position of the

3

parties in this litigation.

4

criteria are not at issue in this litigation.

5

something that the District Court or the Court of Appeals

6

passed on, and clearly we don't rely on the resolution in any

7

way in this case.

QUESTION:

The Department has a mandatory --

Because if it is, if it isn't contrary to

the statute, then the language of the statute just doesn't

17

MR. MERRILL:

Your question, I take it is, even if we

18

have no duty to impose, do we still have the authority to

19

impose?

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

21

MR. MERRILL:

22

don't think that the answer to that question needs to be

23

reached here.

MR. MERRILL:

2

No.

The opposition suggests that we

have a mandatory duty to impose restrictions when the domestic

industry is not viable whether or not that would have any

effect whatsoever on the restoration of the viability of the

industry.

7

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but if the Department could

8

impose the restrictions even though the industry is not viable,

9

you're saying they could impose the restrictions even though

10

they would do no good whatsoever, even though they would not

restore viability.
