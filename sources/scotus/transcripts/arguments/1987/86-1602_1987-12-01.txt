ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. MILES COHN, ESQUIRE

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COHN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
United Savings is a secured creditor of Timbers of

11

12

Inwood Forest Associates, a debtor under Chapter 11 of the

13

Bankruptcy Code.

14

against this debtor.

15

has much more.

As a creditor, United Savings has a claim
But as a secured creditor, United Savings

United has an interest in property of the bankruptcy

16
17

estate.

18

trust, or real property mortgage, on property owned by the

19

debtor, that property being an apartment project located in

20

Houston, Texas.

21

Specifically, that interest is a first lien deed of

Pursuant to the provisions of that mortgage and under

22

applicable laws of the State of Texas, United Savings has the

23

right to have its security interest foreclosed at such time as

24

the debtor may default, has the right to have the property sold

25

at a foreclosure sale at that time, and then to take the

1

proceeds of that sale, or the proceeds of its subsequent

2

disposition of the property, and apply those proceeds to its

3

debt, to take that money in effect and put it out in a new

4

investment and to begin earning interest or other income on

5

that new investment, and to take that money also and apply it

6

to the payment of its debt.

7
8

QUESTION:

Mr. Cohn, were you representing the client

in the proceedings below?

9

MR. COHN:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

And was a petition ever filed with the

11

Bankruptcy Court for relief from the stay under Section

12

362(d)(2)?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. COHN:

No, Your Honor.

This action was

originally brought under 362(d)(1) only.
QUESTION:

I just wondered why no petition was filed

for relief from the stay.
MR. COHN:

Well, it was a petition for relief from

18

the stay, Your Honor.

It was filed under 362(d)(1), rather

19

than under 362(d)(2). And I suppose of hindsight were foresight

20

and we were starting this all over again, we might have done it

21

differently.

22

suspect elsewhere across the country, the practice in this sort

23

of case was to focus very early on in the case on the question

24

of whether the secured creditor's interest in property was

25

adequately protected.

But at this time, particulary in Texas, but I

That was the typical practice, and

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

1

therefore, this motion was filed focusing on that issue.
QUESTION:

2

3

Did the debtor have any equity in the

property here?

4

MR. COHN:

No, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

No, I didn't think so.

6

MR. COHN:

The debtor does not have equity in the

8

QUESTION:

Right.

9

MR. COHN:

And that was one of the findings of the

7

property.

10

Bankruptcy Court.

11

what those findings were.

12

I think it is important in fact to emphasize

Bankruptcy Code Section 362(a) imposes an automatic

13

stay which stops the exercise of rights and property at such

14

time as a bankruptcy case is commenced.

15

imposes a very real cost on a secured creditor.

16

measured by the income lost, the income that could have been

17

earned had the creditor been allowed, but for the automatic

18

stay, to exercise its rights and property.

19

QUESTION:

The automatic stay
That cost is

How long can that cost continue to be

20

extracted from the creditor?

21

certain amount of time in which this thing has to be brought to

22

an end or else it is not considered an effective

23

reorganization.

24
25

I mean, under (d)(2) there is a

Isn't that true?

MR. COHN:

No, Your Honor,

(d)(2) does not set forth

any kind of specific standard or time limit.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

QUESTION:

1

I'm sure nothing specific.

But it can't

2

be considered an effective reorganization if it drags on

3

interminably, can it?

4

MR. COHN:

At some point it has dragged on so long

5

and there is no little hope of any kind of reorganization that

6

the Bankruptcy Court might terminate the stay on other grounds.

7

But that might be two or three years, it might be many months,

8

it might be any period of time that causes injury and damage to

9

the secured creditor.

10

QUESTION:

Do you think it can go on for two years?

11

MR. COHN:

I have seen cases that have, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Should they?

13

MR. COHN:

Normally not, Your Honor, but they should,

14

and I think it is important to focus, in answering the question

15

posed by this case, not on the single asset case.

16

single asset case in which to some extent the issues are

17

blended together, but the same issue arises in multiple asset

18

cases.

19

This is a

You might have a Continental Airlines in which a

20

secured creditor holding a lien on one airplane comes in and

21

says the stay ought to be terminated, and if there is no

22

protection for the interest of that secured creditor in the

23

sense of the time value of money, it is very difficult for that

24

creditor to come in and argue that the proceedings have dragged

25

on too long.

Heritage

628-4888

7
1

In terms of a very complex case, the proceedings

2

might last justifiably a very long period of time, but that

3

should not take the place of the need to protect the individual

4

secured creditors.

5

QUESTION:

The only point I am making is that there

6

is some outside limit that is introduced elsewhere in the Code

7

upon how long the creditor has to eat the interest, in effect.

8

9

MR. COHN:
answer is yes and no.

I hate to be difficult, but I think the
Yes, in that the Bankruptcy Court has

10

discretion at some point to take action under some other

11

provisions, but no, in the sense that there is no principal

12

basis for measuring the damage done to the secured creditor and

13

imposing some kind of protection as time goes on other than

14

adequate protection under 362(d)(1) and 361.

15

Yes, at some point the Court may conclude that this

16

case has dragged on too long, but even if that is six months

17

past what might be a reasonable limit, the secured creditor has

18

incurred very serious costs.

19

The seriousness of those costs I think is well

20

illustrated by the facts of this case.

21

found that but for the automatic stay, United Savings could

22

have foreclosed on the property and liquidated its collateral

23

within six months of the filing of the case, that United could

24

have earned $4.25 million by selling the property, and could

25

have reinvested that money at 12 percent interest per annum.

QUESTION:

1

May I ask a question there?

That is a

2

higher return than they would have gotten if there had been no

3

default, I take it?

4

MR. COHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

One of the rights you seek to protect is

6

the right to get the benefits out of a foreclosure to which you

7

have a legal entitlement, which may be better than having the

8

debt paid according to its original terms.
If that right is to be protected, should it not also

9
10

be protected for the oversecured creditor?
MR. COHN:

11

Well, I believe the oversecured creditor

12

is protected, because — and this is one of the confusing

13

things about the Opinion of the Court below.

14
15

argued that all undersecured creditors are entitled to periodic
«
cash payments. Creditors, secured creditors are entitled to

16

some protection for the costs of delay.

17

oversecured creditor is protected because he in a sense has

18

equity in the property and he knows that when he gets to the

19

end of the proceeding there is value to cover the costs of

20

delay.

QUESTION:

But he doesn't get the 12 percent rate.

4

You are getting 12 percent, if I understand you.
MR. COHN:

5

We get 12 percent but not, if the debtor

6

elects, under Section 1142, to reinstate the debt according to

7

its terms.

8

9

In essence, it is like there are two tracks going
along.

The secured creditors rights might be measured by

10

default, in which case he gets in essence the money he could

11

have earned in the event that there had been a default or he

12

gets what would have happened if the debtor reinstates and

13

lives up to the terms of the contract.

The debtor has that election.

The debtor can live up to the

QUESTION:

Not if he doesn't have the money.

MR. COHN:

protected.

up owning the property.

22

QUESTION:

If the property is substantially

oversecured, if the debt is substantially oversecured,

24

presumably the property would sell for more than the

25

obligation.

Heritage

11
1

MR. COHN:

If it is substantial enough.

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. COHN:

It depends how much the gap is.

4

QUESTION:

And it is true, isn't it, that the

5

oversecured creditor would, at the end of the line, get the

6

contractual interest, not the amount of interest that you say

7

the undersecured creditor might be entitled to get?
MR. COHN:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor.

At the end of the line,

the oversecured creditor will get his contractual interest.

10

But, if the debtor elects to keep the contract in force in a

11

plan of reorganization, the debtor also will get the benefit of

12

contractual interest.

13

court has attempted to reconcile the sections, and I don't

14

think there is any problem in the context of a plan of

15

reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court saying to the

16

undersecured creditor who has gotten perhaps more interest than

17

he would have under the contract that we are going to rebate or

18

count some payments against you to make up for that difference

19

because the creditor is now going to reinstate.

There is one case on record where a

percent interest but it is calculated on what in this case

23

higher, in fact, in this case it's lower than the contract

amount because contract interest was 14 percent.

But if you

3

that is much less, so that the total you are getting is still

4

less than you would be getting if you got your payments.

5

that stands to reason because the debtor always has the option

6

of making the regular payments.

And

I don't think there is any court that wouldn't allow

He just took his security and foreclosed

and thumbed his nose at the Bankruptcy Court.
MR. COHN:

20

That is correct, Your Honor, because the

21

cases under the Bankruptcy Act uniformly held that except in

22

certain very limited circumstances where the secured creditor

23

for some other reason.was protected, the secured creditor was

24

entitled to take back his property if the debtor had no equity

in it.

In other words, if he had no equity, what's the point
of the debtor keeping the property?
What the Bankruptcy Code did was to put something

4

really dramatic into the Code.

5

Court must terminate the stay if there is inadequate protection

6

or if some other standard is not met, the Code also allows the

7

Bankruptcy Court to condition the automatic stay.

had whatever value there was in the security and used that

MR. COHN:

QUESTION:

My point is that we all agree that the

things that are set forthin the legislative

In response to

history.

And I

10

might say as an aside that there has been a lot of argument in

11

the lower courts and many articles written on this subject that

12

spends a lot of time on what adequate protection means, what

13

indubitable equivalent means, various terms that may have some

14

meaning in other contexts but aren't really defined in the

15

Bankruptcy Code.

16

argument they sometimes

17

are stated in the legislative history.

And I

think in getting mixed into that
miss the two really clear things that

18

One is that Congress chose, consciously chose, not to

19

define the meaning of value, and therefore I think it is unfair

20

to latch onto examples in the legislative history or little

21

bits and pieces or words.

22

Senate reports, in more than one place,

.23
24
25

Congress, in both the House and
made very clear that

this was a matter to be left to judicial development.
But on the other hand, and this is the second thing
that is very important, Congress made very clear that it sought

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16
1

to protect the full value of the creditor's interest in

2

property.
In both the House and Senate reports, there is

3
4

language that the full benefit of the creditor's bargain should

5

be protected, and an interesting aside to that is that the

6

House and Senate reports also say that this means something

7

more than what the Constitution requires.

8

generally has been interpreted to require that the value of the

9

collateral at least be protected.

The Constitution

And the House and Senate

10

Report said that adequate protection means more than that.

It

11

means that even though the creditor may not be allowed to

12

foreclose exactly on default or exactly at the time when he

13

might under state law, even though he might not get in kind

14

what he is entitled to under state law, that nevertheless he

15

would be entitled to the value of what he gets under state law.
I think that if you begin with this thing, that

16
17

Congress wanted to protect the value of the creditor's interest

18

in property, in this case the value of a mortgage, it

19

necessarily follows that the costs of delay must be protected,

20

for several reasons.
First of all, that is the essence of the secured

21
22

creditor's rights.

The secured creditor has a right under his

23

mortgage to foreclose on default.

24

all due respect to this apartment project, doesn't want the

25

project.

The secured creditor, with

United Savings doesn't want to own this property.

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

17

1

United Savings wants to use the property as a means to recover

2

its loan, and it does that by having it sold at foreclosure

3

sale as soon as it is entitled to under the mortgage, taking

4

that money, putting it out at interest, and the quicker it can

5

do that and the more interest it can earn, the quicker it can

6

recover its debt.

7

Moreover, and I think this is another very, very

8

crucial thing that as overlooked by the Court below, this

9

value, this time value of money, is something that is protected

10
11

under non-bankruptcy law.
No one would doubt that a fee simple interest in

12

property is worth more than a future interest in property. I

13

don't think anybody would doubt that.

14

Surely it follows that a temporary deprivation of an

15

interest in property decreases its value, and in fact, in

16

another context, this Court held recently, in First English

17

Evangelical Lutheran Church, that an owner's interest in

18

property was decreased when, for a period of time, he was

19

temporarily deprived of that interest.

20

And I don't think there is any reason for treating

21

security interests any differently.

22

is deprived of his property for a period of time, the value of

23

that security interest is less.

the interpretation you are putting on this creates?

3

MR. COHN:

Certainly.

QUESTION:

Subsection 362(b) provides for — you are

5

moving under (d)(1).

6

MR. COHN:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

Which says the automatic stay can be

8

terminated for cause, including the lack of adequate protection

9

of an interest in property.

Now, you are saying that there is

10

automatically inadequate protection when a less than fully

11

secured creditor is not given the time value of his money,

12

in effect, right?

13
14
15

MR. COHN:

Yes, although the question is phrased a

little bit differently.
QUESTION:

Nonetheless, you are saying that that

16

comes to the same thing.

17

unless you are assured, unless the stay is modified to give you

18

the time value of the money.

19

There is lack of adequate protection

If that is the case, then why isn't (d)(2) entirely

20

superfluous?

That is, with respect to a stay of an act against

21

property under Subsection (a), you can move for modification if

22

two conditions.

23

in such property -- but that is always going to be the case

24

when you have an undersecured creditor — and, two, you need a

25

second condition under (d)(2) -- such property is not necessary

Number one, the debtor does not have an equity

for an effective reorganization.

2

You wouldn't need that second condition under your

3

theory of the case, because the first condition, the first part

4

of (d)(2) would be the same as (d)(1), and you wouldn't need a

5

second part to (d)(2).

6

MR. COHN:

I think the mistake in that analysis is

7

that adequate protection, the (d)(1) section, is not directed

8

just to this.

It could have been written a lot more specifically to

But instead the Code required adequate protection of an

QUESTION:

And it could have been written

Well,

(d)(1) isn't written just for this.

But (d)(2) is written just for this.
MR. COHN:

(d)(2) is not necessarily limited to a

17

single asset case.

18

moving for relief from the stay with respect to a single asset.

19

In (d)(2), one thing that enters into the analysis that I might

20

add is that the second part of the test on (d)(2) which

21

requires that there be a reasonable hope of reorganization,

22

doesn't require rehabilitation because a reorganization can

23

include a liquidating plan.

24
25

It would apply to any.

Obviously, you are

4

There are all kinds of

So there are circumstances where you wouldn't be

entitled to relief under (d)(2), but you would still be

6

entitled to some kind of relief, not necessarily termination of

7

the stay, but some kind of relief under (d)(1).

8

QUESTION:

Give m an example, specifically.

9

MR. COHN:

I think an example would be — I can think

10

of more than one.

11

the debtor has no equity in property and therefore there is

12

some reason for relief under (d)(1), but nevertheless, it is

13

necessary for an effective reorganization, because the debtor

14

is using that property and cannot easily replace it.

15
16
17

You might have a multiple asset case where

So the creditor may not be entitled to any relief
under (d)(2) but may be entitled to relief under (d)(1).
Another circumstance would be, in a single asset

case, where the debtor has —

No, I want the opposite.

It might be a different kind of relief.

I'm not sure what you mean.

MR. COHN:

an example, where the creditor comes in and says we will offer

you adequate protection by giving you a lien on other property

I would just like to briefly respond to two points
that have been raised by Petitioner.
First, that the time value of foreclosure rights is

4

protected by state law is a question that I can't answer.

5

it is a question that the Federal Bankruptcy Code has answered.

6

The Federal Bankruptcy Code in Section 502(b)(2() and in

7

Section 506(a) and (b) has legislated on the issue of interest.

8

This Court, in Butner, specifically stated that in cases where

9

the Legislature has spoken on issues, that Federal law will

10
11

12
13

override the state law.
I would just point out to the Court that that issue
has been decided under the Bankruptcy Code.
Secondly, both (d)(1) and (d)(2) were part of a law

prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code.

MR. SIMON:

1

Well, I beg to differ with the Court,

2

but at some point there was a time when in order to get an

automatic stay effected, a debtor had to take affirmative

action to do so.
Once it was effected, however, then we were under the

same rules that we are under right now.

22

What we glean, although this is not an area that is

very clear, what we glean from all of these cases is that the

24

Court goes through the following analysis.

25

First, it looks to the actual words of the statute to

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25
1

see if the intent of Congress is clear from the face of the

2

statute — that is, the plain meaning rule — and, whether such

3

interpretation is harmonious with the entire statutory scheme.

4

Second, the analysis goes through the Congressional

5

policy of the underlying statute to see if the proper

6

interpretation is consistent with the Congressional policy

7

underlying the statute.

8

9

Third, if, only if the intent of Congress cannot be
gleaned from the first two elements, then the Court will go

10

into the legislative history.

11

divided at times on the types of legislative history used or

12

whether legislative history is appropriate to use, beginning in

13

1950 with a stream of cases, from that point, this Court has

14

been more willing to look at legislative history because of the

15

availability of the legislative history to both sides.

16

And as this Court has been

QUESTION:

It is not designated as interest.

United Savings will continue through the proceeding without

MR. SIMON:

No question about that.

There is an answer to that question in the

saying no, it isn't receiving interest.

MR. SIMON:

It is not receiving interest.

I would

just like though to refer this to the Court.

9

I understand that this proceeding has taken quite a

10

long time, and I understand that United has not been receiving

11

interest for a long time, and I understand that a plan of

12

reorganization has not been filed or confirmed.

13

a result of the fact that the issues that are determined by the

14

Court today have to be decided before something can be done.

But that is as

And in the Continental case, which is, the full cite

16

of the case is Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust

18

long delay were without adequate excuse, the retention of the

19

injunction for the long period which has intervened since it

20

was granted could not be justified, but the delay is obviously

21

due to the many doubts and uncertainties arising from the

present litigation.

proceedings should go forward to completion without further

the proper remedy is a motion to dismiss.

The phrase

in addition to that:

its logical conclusion, that if the market rate is higher than

the contract rate, then they would be getting a benefit over an

9

oversecured creditor.

Furthermore, it is true that if taken to

10

inconsistent.

11

is absolutely no reason why undersecured creditors would not be

12

entitled to lost opportunity costs, for, were it not for the

13

imposition of the automatic stay, they would have been entitled

14

to go to judgment, they would have had a judgment lien on their

not believe that that is what Judge Clark was saying.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought otherwise, and like

Justice Stevens, I will have to read it again.
MR. SIMON:

Finally, I would like to point out two

24

things out of the legislative history that are amusing, if not

25

interesting.

There were two Amicus Briefs filed in this case,

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41
1

one by the National Commercial Finance Conference.

2

legislative proceedings that preceded the enactment of the

3

Code, the party speaking for National Commercial Finance

4

Conference, during those Committee hearings, stated that the

5

secured creditor should receive periodic payments during the

6

pendency of the stay to cover depreciation of property or wear

7

and tear.

8
9

In the

It is very interesting that they are now adopting a
different approach, when in the Committee hearings they clearly

10

adopted the approach that has been adopted by the Fifth

11

Circuit.
Secondly, the other amicus that has filed in this

12
13

case, American Bankers Association, also stated that the

14

automatic stay should remain in effect if it is clear that the

15

value of the secured creditor's claim against the collateral

16

will be preserved, and further said that the suggested

17

standards set forth in the Commission's notes should be

18

included in the statute.

19

said that conditions which may be imposed by the Court when

20

appropriate include, one, requiring other security of an

21

equivalent or two, if there is no equity, or the equity is

22

marginal, requiring additional security to the extent of the

23

anticipated decrease in the value of collateral as a result of

24

its use.

25

And the Commission's notes basically

I find that very interesting, that they are now

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

42
1

jumping on the bandwagon and taking the position that this is

2

what the law was at the time that the Code was enacted.

3

I would also point out to the Court that there was

4

only one comment in all of the legislative history that ended

5

up with the Bankruptcy Code, that even talked about this issue,

6

and it was a part of a law journal article from Mr. Murphy.

15

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

16

MR. COHN:

I would like to begin by responding to

17

Justice Stevens' guestion and just make clear what our position

18

is on the Briggs issue, also.

19

is that a secured creditor, as well as others with interest in

20

property of the estate — that may be a co-owner, or a spouse

21

with interest in community property, anyone with interest in

22

property of the estate — is entitled to protection for the

23

costs of delay imposed by the automatic stay.

24

25

necessarily require periodic post-petition payments.

condition the stay and that raises the whole issue of what

22

periodic payments or what other protection should be fashioned.

23

Under the Bankruptcy Act, protection for the. cost of delay was

24

provided in a different way by simply terminating the stay.

25

I think they are inapposite.

I think that

There is really a different

Under the Bankruptcy Code you have an ability to

I would like to return finally to the language of the

Heritage

46

statute, to again make clear our position.

2

not rely so heavily on the phrases "adequate protection" and

3

"indubitable equivalent" as the Respondent suggests.

4

think that an analysis of those words supports our position and

5

those arguments are set forth in the brief.

6

better argument and one that perhaps goes more to the heart of

7

the issue is found by looking at the wording of Sections 361(1)

8

and (2) which describe the objects of adequate protection.

9

The Petitioner does

I do

But I think a

Those sections are directed to decreases in the value

10

of an interest in property — in this case a mortgage -- so

11

they are directed to decreases in the value of the mortgage

12

I think there is no

Those findings have never been questioned by

It is also clear that that value is

Now, if Congress sought to protect the full value of

24

creditors' interest in property, to protect the benefit of

25

their bargain, how could it be that this important element of

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

47
1

value that is recognized by state courts is somehow omitted?

2

That is not suggested in the legislative history and I think it

3

is clear that that element of value should be protected.

4

Otherwise, we're left in a very odd position, which is that a

5

Congress, which has directed in the legislative history that

6

the full value of rights and property should be protected, will

7

somehow have enacted a statute that leaves secured creditors

8

worse off than they were under the Bankruptcy Act.

9

QUESTION:

Assume we come to the conclusion,

10

erroneous, I'm sure you think, that the secured creditor, prior

11

to the adoption of the Code, would not have had the time value

12

of his money and would have been deprived of it.

13

that nevertheless, the Code, the way it is worded, should give

14

him something that he wasn't entitled to before?

15

MR. COHN:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

Do you think

The only reason

16

that I go into what the law was before enactment of the Code is

17

to put in context some of the examples that were used in the

18

legislative history.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

So what the law was before doesn't govern

what the law is now?
MR. COHN:

No, absolutely not. I think it helps put

22

in context some of the arguments that are made against our

23

position, but the statute as written directs and defines the

24

object of adequate protection as the value of the creditor's

25

interest in property, the value of the mortgage, in particular

Heritage

Reporting(202)

Corporation

628-4888

48
1

directs that the secured creditor be protected to the extent

2

that that value is decreased by the automatic stay.

3

think it is clear, as the Bankruptcy Court found, that if the

4

automatic stay keeps the creditor from foreclosing for a period

5

of time, then the value of that mortgage is decreased.

6

that is what ought to be protected.
