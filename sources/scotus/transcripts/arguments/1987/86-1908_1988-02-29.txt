ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. A. FLOWERS, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. FLOWERS:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
The issue in this case is whether State law or

12

Federal law governs the enforceability of a forum selection

13

clause in a contract between two private parties in a suit

14

brought in Federal Court.

15

A brief history of this case is as follows:

16

Petitioner sued respondents in the United States District Court

17

for the Northern District of Alabama.

18

State law claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty,

19

fraud and deceit.

20

respondents for a violation of the antitrust laws.

21

Petitioners asserted the

Petitioners also asserted a claim against

In response to the Complaint, respondents filed a

22

motion to dismiss or transfer based on a forum selection clause

23

contained in the contract.

24

Alabama law, rather than Federal law, governed the

25

enforceability of the forum selection clause and that Alabama

Heritage

The District Court held that

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

refuses to enforce such contractual provisions.
The District Court also expressly held that an

2

3

Alabama forum was as convenient as a New York forum if not more

4

convenient.
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals accepted an

5
6

interlocutory appeal over the forum selection clause issue

7

pursuant to Section 1292(b).

8

banc fashioned a wholly judge made rule in favor of contractual

9

forum selection clauses.

10

The Court ultimately sitting en

There were five dissenters in the

Court below.
It is undisputed in this case that the contractual

11

12

provision before the Court today is absolutely unenforceable in

13

an Alabama State Court.

14

There is no question about that.

The question in this case is whether a Federal

15

District Court sitting in Alabama should enforce that very same

16

contractual provision.

17

resolved based solely on the plain language of the Rules of

18

Decision Act and the clear command of the Rules of Decision

19

Act.

That issue and this case can be

Under the Rules of Decision Act, the Federal Courts

are directed to first look to State law for applicable rules of

State law.

of the displacement of State law which results.

language of the Act is clear.

to apply State law.

MR. FLOWERS:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

law?

18

MR. FLOWERS:

QUESTION:

20

Yes, sir.

There was also a choice of law provision

Nor has

Yes, sir.

Now, does New York law have any bearing on

the issue we're talking about?

21

MR. FLOWERS:

New York law, Justice Stevens, does

22

enforce forum selection clauses.

23

the courts in New York, the courts of Alabama, and the Eleventh

24

Circuit refused to give effect to a choice of law clause when

25

to do so would be in contravention of a public policy of the

However, it is settled that

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

State whose law would otherwise apply.

2

This Court's decision in Griffin v. McKoch which is

3

discussed in my Reply Brief supports that conclusion as well.

4

And the Burger King decision decided three years ago also

5

recognizes that principle.
QUESTION:

6

Excuse me.

You're not saying that Alabama

7

would decline to apply New York substantive law, as well?

8

are you?
MR. FLOWERS:

9
10

Alabama law would refuse to apply New

York law with respect to the forum selection clause.
QUESTION:

11
12

Or

I understand that, but what about with

respect to the substance of the dispute?
MR. FLOWERS:

13

New York law would govern, assuming

14

there was no conflict with the laws of Alabama. Alabama

15

enforces choice of law clauses with the one exception that I

16

mentioned.

17

QUESTION:

If Alabama's willing to apply New York

18

substantive rules, what is the Alabama interest in not allowing

19

the other -- I understand you say there is a rule, but why do

20

they have such a rule for a case like this where another

21

State's law's going to apply any way?

22

MR. FLOWERS:

Well, it really gets down to the point

23

that the fulfillment of the expectations of the parties is not

24

the only interest in contract law, and the Courts of New York

25

and Alabama and the court below recognized that the public

2

whether to apply or give effect to a choice of law clause.

3

QUESTION:

4

5

being implemented?

I understand, but what is Alabama's,

Why is there such a public policy?

What policy is

I can understand if if the case had been brought in a

6

7

State court, they might want to say, our courts ought to go

8

forward, but why does Alabama care whether Federal judges in

9

New York or in Birmingham decide this case?

10

MR. FLOWERS:

Well,

I don't think it's a question of

11

whether the State law is concerned with what the Federal -courts

12

do.

13

faced with an issue that is not governed by Federal law, the

14

Federal court should decide the case the same way that a State

15

court sitting in the same State would decide the issue.

16

think that is the plan of the Rules of Decision Act.

17

My answer to your question is that when a Federal court is

I

Alabama's policy against forum selection clauses is

18

an adoption of the common law rule.

19

parties to an agreement or contract could not prevent a Court

20

from hearing their dispute, and the common law approach also

21

recognized the interest of the State in providing a local and

22

convenient forum for its residents.

Under the common law, the

23

As I mentioned, Alabama is the common law rule.

24

has no Federal origin, and that being the case, a Federal

25

District Court in Alabama should decide the issue the same way

that the State Court would which is it's unenforceable.
QUESTION:

2

That isn't true in every situation, Mr.

3

Flowers.

4

say that in some situations, the District Court does not

5

necessarily decide the case the same way as the State court

6

would.

7

Steven's point that this is just a question whether a Federal

8

District Judge in Alabama will try the case or a Federal

9

District Judge in New York will try it.

10
11

Gases like Hanna against Plumer and some other cases

And I don't know that you fully responded to Justice

The Alabama State

courts aren't involved at all.
MR. FLOWERS:

Well, that's true. But under this

12

Court's decisions in Murphree and Neirbo, language such as the

13

Redwing Carriers case, the Alabama Supreme Court that the

14

parties cannot oust the jurisdiction of a State Court, the

15

Court has considered that language in other cases and has come

16

to the conclusion that when no Federal law otherwise governs,

17

like there was in Hanna, there was a Federal law that governed

18

over the State law, that the District Court should decide the

19

issue the same way.

20

Now, obviously, Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are

21

cases in which a Federal law controls over the State law and

22

Hanna v. Plumer is an example.

23

simply venue, or which court is appropriate.

24

Corporation

628-4888

1

whether State law or Federal law governs the enforceability of

2

a party's choice between two suitable courts in a contract.

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Flowers, I guess at least one or

4

more of the Judges in the Court of Appeals thought that in

5

making the venue, in deciding the venue issue that the parties'

6

contractual provision is one of the factors to be considered.

7
8

9
10
11

Is that a sensible inquiry to make in connection with
application of Section 1404, do you suppose?
MR. FLOWERS:

First of all, the Court below did not

base their decision to transfer on 1404(a).
QUESTION:

Do you think that the Court could have?

12

And that the parties' contractual agreement should be a factor

13

in making that decision?

14

MR. FLOWERS:

I don't think so, and for this reason.

15

First, to give effect to a forum selection clause under 1404(a)

16

would mean that you're allowing Federal law to control after

17

you've determined that the Rules of Decision Act says that

18

under State law, the clause is not enforceable.

19

On the other hand, should the Court believe that the

20

contractual provision should be considered by the Court, it

21

should not be given conclusive effect like respondents ask the

22

Court to do.

23

This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the

24

District Court must retain flexibility in ruling on Section

25

1404(a) motions.

This individualized case by case

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

consideration of convenience and fairness militates against a

2

per se rule such as the one that respondents offer in this

3

case.

They've lost on the 1404 convenience issue.
QUESTION:

4

Wasn't the District Court, though, partly

5

influenced by his view that the Alabama law should be given

6

controlling significance here?

7

MR. FLOWERS:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Order by

8

the District Court is a short one but in his finding that

9

Alabama was as convenient forum as a New York forum, he did not

10

say in his Order whether he considered the forum selection

11

clause issue in making that determination of convenience.
I think that the forum selection clause issue really

12

13

goes to the section requirement under 1404(a) of the interest

14

of justice.

15

question since he found that Alabama was a convenient forum and

16

respondents did not seek an interlocutory appeal on the 1404(a)

17

issue.

18
19

And the District Court did not need to reach that

QUESTION:

You acknowledge that that's the second

requirement and not just part of the first?

20

MR. FLOWERS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. FLOWERS:

Interest of justice?

You think that's a separate requirement?
Yes, sir, I think that there must be a

23

finding of convenience in the parties of interest, and further

24

convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further that it

25

be in the interest of justice to support a transfer, and I rely

on Ex Parte Collett.
QUESTION:

2

For which purpose you can consider any

3

other factors and not just the convenience of the parties and

4

witnesses?

5

MR. FLOWERS:

6

QUESTION:

Well, you can —

That would make a big difference to me, if

7

you think that there are two reasons why you can order a change

8

of venue, either for the convenience of parties and witnesses,

9

or in the interest of justice.

10

MR. FLOWERS:

No, sir, I'm contending that you've got

11

to have both.

12

both, convenience of the parties and witnesses, and in the

13

interests of justice, is the way I understand Section 1404(a).

14

I think this Court's said you've got to have

As I mentioned, there is no Federal law governing the

22

laws of the several states contained in the Rules of Decision

23

24

the statutory law of the state.

25

selection clauses involve questions of common law, as I

It is now well settled that the phrase, the

The enforceability of forum

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

mentioned earlier, common law approach was that parties to a

2

contract cannot agree to prevent a Court from hearing their

3

case.

4

There's no conflict in this case between any Federal

5

law, including the Venue Statutes, and Alabama's laws and

6

policy against forum selection clauses.

7

QUESTION:

Counsel, could the lower Court here, the

8

District Court, have ordered that part of the action be

9

transferred to New York and part retained in Alabama, assuming

10

the requisite findings had been made?

11

allow that?

12

MR. FLOWERS:

Are there precedents to

Justice Kennedy, the District Court

13

held that the claims that were not -- the non-contract claims

14

could not be transferred to New York, even if the others could,

15

which he said they couldn't, either.

16

The Second Circuit in the Bense case, and the

17

Eleventh Circuit in this case have held that all claims could

18

be transferred to the chosen forum.

19

QUESTION:

I just want to know, is there substantial

20

authority in cases for Federal courts to transfer parts of

21

actions and keep others?

22
23
24
25

MR. FLOWERS:

Does that happen from time to time?
I do not know of any case holding the

retention of claims.
QUESTION:

I mean, because the District Court seemed

to be influenced by that consideration in its order.

12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

And I

1

just can't quite understand that.
MR. FLOWERS:

2

Well, I don't think that's the

3

strongest point of his Order, but I'm just not aware of any

4

cases other than the Bense case out of the Second Circuit and

5

this one.
QUESTION:

6

7

I agree that's not the strongest point in

his Order.

8

MR. FLOWERS:

Anyway, Alabama's law is an adoption of

9

the common law policy.

Much of the law of contracts, including

10

the enforceability of forum selection clauses, is shaped by the

11

common law and announced by the State courts.

12

however, not based on Section 1404(a), they simply fashioned a

13

wholly Judge-made rule in favor of forum selection clauses.

The court below,

14

QUESTION:

15

I suppose Alabama law would also oppose, would

May I ask another question, Mr. Flowers?

16

consider it contrary to public policy to have an arbitration

17

provision in the contract for arbitration in New York, for

18

example?

19
20

MR. FLOWERS:
Arbitration Act applies.
QUESTION:

21
22

Then the Federal Statute would override

that.

23

MR. FLOWERS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, unless the Federal

Right.

It's kind of ironic in a way -- I

understand your point, but. -- that arbitration which is a

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

greater intrusion on the judicial process in Alabama than

2

having it tried by another judicial forum in New York would

3

override the policy but this action would not.

4

there's a rule in one and there's not in the other, is your

5

point?

That's because

6

MR. FLOWERS:

That's right.

7

I'm glad you brought the arbitration context up.

8

This case is very analogous to the Bernhardt case decided by

9

the Court in the '50s.

Mr. Bernhardt sued for breach of an

10

employment contract in the Vermont State Court.

11

removed it to Federal Court.

12

Vermont law, rather than Federal law, governed the

13

enforceability of the forum selection clause, and the Second

14

Circuit held, well, this is merely a procedural question,

15

therefore, Federal law governs.

16

The defendant

The District Court held that

This Court granted the writ and held that under the

17

Rules of Decision Act in Erie, State law governed.

18

held it would be an inequitable administration of the law of

19

the State to allow Vermont law to prevail only in the State

20

court and not in the Federal court when there was no conflict.

21

In Bernhardt, the Federal Arbitration Act had already been

22

passed, so Congress had expressed a policy in favor of

23

arbitration, but the Act did not apply to the case before it,

24

because it didn't involve an interstate or maritime

25

transaction.

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The Court

It's also interesting to note that the rationale

1
2

behind the common law approach against arbitration clauses is

3

the same rationale that's behind forum selection clauses, and

4

that is, parties cannot agree in a contract to prevent a court

5

from taking jurisdiction or to hear the case.
QUESTION:

6

Well, wasn't the reasoning of the Eleventh

7

Circuit majority, obviously they ruled against you, really that

8

there is a Federal rule here, or Federal law, it's the Venue

9

Statute?
MR. FLOWERS:

10

That's what they said, but I don't seen

11

anywhere in the Venue Statutes that address this question.

12

Venue is proper in Alabama and it's proper in New York.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the contract certainly

14

is aimed at controlling which Federal Court, if there's a

15

diversity case, would try the case, which is a venue question,

16

surely.

17

MR. FLOWERS:

18

determined by the Venue Statute.

19

20

QUESTION:

What does venue mean?

MR. FLOWERS:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

It means where may

or should an action be brought.

21

23

Well, the appropriate venue is

That's correct.

And the contractual provision is aimed

directly at that question.

Well, I submit that, with all due

respect, Your Honor, your analysis is wrong, and I say that for

6

this reason.

8

says you determine that question by looking at the Venue

That in VanDusen, the Court held that under

It doesn't make any sense to analyze forum selection clauses in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT M. PHELPS, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. PHELPS:

11

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The answer to the question, which United States

13
14

District Court will hear this case involving diversity and

15

federal question jurisdiction is an answer in which the State

16

of Alabama simply has no legitimate interest.

17

That's the first of four points that I want to make,

18

that there is no State interest that precludes the transfer of

19

this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a).
Next, that the application of a Federal Rule to this

20
21

case in no way violates the holding of this Court in Erie v.

22

Tompkins.

23

QUESTION:

Before you get into whether there's any

24

State interest, I really worry about importing into the Federal

25

Venue Rules, the kind of choice of law determinations that have

Heritage

become standard in conflict of laws now.

2

that's how we should resolve Erie type questions, whether, even

3

though the State law is thus and such, there is a real interest

4

on the part of the State?

5
6
7

Or is it a false conflict?

Are you saying that

You're familiar with the

false conflict?
MR. PHELPS:

I think there are a number of parts to

8

that question.

And the way that I would

go about it is I would

9

say that if there's no State interest involved, no legitimate

10

State interest, the State interest as announced by Red Wing

11

Carriers is to protect the jurisdiction of the Courts of the

12

State of Alabama for a case that has Federal jurisdiction,

13

Sherman Act claims.

14

And that interest simply is not invoked.

I would then

look at the other side and see what

15

evidence there is of a Federal interest.

16

the Federal interest is the breadth of the Venue Statutes, the

17

general Venue Statutes, the Clayton Act Venue Statute, and the

18

statutes dealing directly with transfer.

19

And the evidence of

And then I would look, much like the court did in

20

another Alabama case that came to the Court, Burlington Norther

21

v. Woods dealing with Alabama ten percent appeal penalty, and

22

see if the breadth of the Federal Statute covers the question.

I think that I am citing more of the

QUESTION:

Now, did either of the Courts below rely

on that, on 1404?
MR. PHELPS:

The Eleventh Circuit relied solely on

the notion that venue is inherently a matter of Federal

concern, which I think is equally a good position.

I never separated in the way that either the Court has.

it.

that the forum selection clause should be given a strong

And under the

rational of the Bremen case, should the conclusion that you are
reaching be reached, the case would not be transferred.
QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that it was

convenient to the parties to transfer it?
MR. PHELPS:

The District Court made a finding in a

very inverted way that supports that position.

The District

Court's finding was that Alabama is no less inconvenient or no
less convenient than New York.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

So then it sounds to be like the

Eleventh Circuit didn't care about convenience.
MR. PHELPS:

No.

I think what happens is, under the

Bremen, is the burden is flipped, and once you reach the
decision that there is no substantial inconvenience or it is
not unreasonable to enforce the forum selection clause, then it
is enforceable, and that specific factual finding by the
District Court, although in a different context, supports the
transfer.

If that is in

But that's not the interest the State court has

QUESTION:

Mr. Phelps, can I come back to your

assertion that it makes a difference what the purpose of the
State rule is in determining whether you will apply State law
or Federal law.
Suppose you have a State statute of limitations, and

fact, it says it in the statute of limitations and the State
Supreme Court says it in the opinion applying it that the only
purpose of this statute is to protect our courts against the
burden of old litigation.

That's the only purpose of it.

Do you think in that case the Federal court would not

No, the Federal court would.

have to under York, I would think, versus Guaranty Trust.
QUESTION:

So then what difference does it make here

whether the purpose of this State rule is to protect their

Reporting Corporation

courts or to protect their citizens?
MR. PHELPS:

The analysis in that cases changes

slightly, and it's like York.

And the problem there is that

that particular fact situation so directly impacts and controls
the outcome of the litigation, it makes the issue of whether
you file the lawsuit in state court or Federal court a matter
of choice where the result would be different, and clearly,
that's prohibited under Erie.
The difference in this case and that is it's not like
the statute of limitations in York, or it's not like res
judicata principles that the Court considered in Angel v.
Bullington.

It simply deals with means and methods by which

the parties are going tp enforce their respective rights of in

And the

reason I thought he'd call that to my attention is because he
wrote the opinion, the Court indicated that the Bremen and
Scherk established a strong presumption in favor of enforcement
of freely negotiated contractual choice of forum provisions.
And that's the presumption I'm talking about.

There

could be a set of circumstances, there could be a set of facts
where it's unreasonable under the circumstances to enforce the
provision, but that would be within the discretion of the
court.
Let me deal in the last couple of minutes with the
notion of the facts in this case and why the facts as presented
to the district court indicate that transfer is appropriate.
Under the Bremen and Scherk and other cases like that, the
essential test has been put that the burden is on the party
trying to avoid the freely negotiated bargain to prove that
they would be affectively deprived of their day in court.
The burden is on the side trying to get out of the
contract, get out of their deal.

this area can be analyzed under the Rules of Decision Act.
